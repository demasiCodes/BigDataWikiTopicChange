{{short description|External manifestation of gender identity}}
'''Gender expression''', or '''gender presentation''', is a person's behavior, mannerisms, and appearance that are socially associated with [[gender]], namely [[femininity]] or [[masculinity]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Gender expression can also be defined as the external manifestation of one's gender identity through behavior, clothing, hairstyles, voice, or body characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Edelman |first=Elijah Adiv |editor-first1=Michael J. |editor-first2=Sandra M. |editor-first3=Momin |editor-last1=Bosia |editor-last2=McEvoy |editor-last3=Rahman |title=Gender Identity and Transgender Rights in Global Perspective |date=6 November 2019 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190673741.013.24 |work=The Oxford Handbook of Global LGBT and Sexual Diversity Politics |pages=61–74 |access-date=17 March 2023 |publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190673741.013.24 |isbn=978-0-19-067374-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Carabez |first1=Rebecca |last2=Pellegrini |first2=Marion |last3=Mankovitz |first3=Andrea |last4=Eliason |first4=Mickey |last5=Scott |first5=Megan |date=12 August 2015 |title=Does your organization use gender inclusive forms?

A person's gender expression may or may not match their assigned sex at birth. This includes [[gender role]]s, and accordingly relies on cultural [[stereotype]]s about gender.&lt;!--sourced in body--&gt; It is distinct from [[gender identity]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Terminology==
Gender expression typically reflects a person's [[gender identity]] (their internal sense of their own gender), but this is not always the case.&lt;ref name="Summers"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Summers|first1=Randal W.|title=Social Psychology: How Other People Influence Our Thoughts and Actions [2 volumes] |date=2016 |publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781610695923|page=232|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5nF1DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APA2015"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=American Psychological Association |title=Guidelines for Psychological Practice With Transgender and Gender Nonconforming People|journal=American Psychologist |date=December 2015|volume=70|issue=9|page=861|url=http://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf|doi=10.1037/a0039906 |pmid=26653312|s2cid=1751773 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender expression is separate and independent both from [[sexual orientation]] and [[Sex assignment|sex assigned at birth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gender, Gender Identity, and Gender Expression |publisher=Government of Alberta |url=https://myhealth.alberta.ca/Alberta/Pages/gender-ID-expression-LGBTQ.aspx |access-date=20 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender identity can be expressed through behavior, clothing, hair, makeup, voice, body language and other aspects of one's external appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Definitions|url=https://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-terminology-and-definitions|access-date=17 November 2021|website=HRC|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender expression does not always fall in line with a person's gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kirkup |first=Kyle |date=1 January 2018 |title=The origins of gender identity and gender expression in Anglo-American legal discourse |url=https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/full/10.3138/utlj.2017-0080 |journal=University of Toronto Law Journal |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=80–117 |doi=10.3138/utlj.2017-0080 |s2cid=148583324 |issn=0042-0220}}&lt;/ref&gt; A type of gender expression that is considered atypical for a person's externally perceived gender may be described as [[Gender variance|gender non-conforming]].

Gender expression can vary widely between individuals and cultures, and may not always align with traditional [[gender role]]s or expectations.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Some people may express their gender in a way that is typically associated with the opposite sex, such as a man wearing a dress or a woman having short hair and wearing masculine clothing.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Others may prefer a gender-neutral or [[androgynous]] appearance, or may choose to present differently depending on the situation or context.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=TRANS 101 |url=https://genderrights.org.au/faq_type/trans-101/ |access-date=13 March 2023 |website=A Gender Agenda |language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In men and boys, typical or [[masculine]] gender expression is often described as ''manly'', while atypical or feminine expression is known as [[Effeminacy|effeminate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kachel |first1=Sven |last2=Steffens |first2=Melanie C. |last3=Niedlich |first3=Claudia |date=2016 |title=Traditional Masculinity and Femininity: Validation of a New Scale Assessing Gender Roles |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=7 |page=956 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00956 |pmid=27458394 |pmc=4932111 |issn=1664-1078 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; In girls and young women, atypically masculine expression is called [[tomboy]]ish. In lesbian and queer women, masculine and feminine expressions are known as [[butch and femme]] respectively. A mixture of typical and atypical expression may be described as [[Androgyny|androgynous]].

The term ''gender expression'' is used in the [[Yogyakarta Principles]], which concern the application of international [[human rights law]] in relation to sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and [[Sex characteristics (legal term)|sex characteristics]].&lt;ref name="ypplus10"&gt;[http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles-en/yp10/ Yogyakarta Principles plus 10]&lt;/ref&gt; The term also designates a criterion for human rights protection in certain countries, including Canada.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite book |title=Policy Change, Courts, and the Canadian Constitution |last=Macfarlane |first=Emmett |publisher=University of Toronto Press |date=2018 |page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Versus sexual orientation ==

While gender expression does not necessarily connect to sexuality, individuals often are misinterpreted as more masculine if [[lesbian]] and more feminine if [[gay]], regardless of the individual's gender expression. These beliefs can lead to people misinterpreting an individual's gender expression based on their sexuality. Studies on adolescents conducted by Stacey Horn, showed that gay and lesbian individuals who did not express themselves as their assigned gender were seen as less acceptable. Individuals who expressed themselves with their assigned gender typically faced less social harassment and discrimination. On the other hand, [[heterosexual]] males whose gender expression was more feminine than masculine were the most discriminated against.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horn | first1 = Stacey S | title = Adolescents' Acceptance of Same-Sex Peers Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Expression | journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence | year = 2007 | volume = 36 | issue = 3| pages = 373 | doi = 10.1007/s10964-007-9176-4 | pmid = 27519035 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The heterosexual matrix" theory created by gender theorist [[Judith Butler]] posits that people often assume someone's sexuality based on their visible gender and sex. Lisa Disch states that it explains why people tend to assume someone's gender expression based on their sex and sexuality.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Disch | first1 = Lisa | title = Judith Butler and the Politics of the Performative | journal = Political Theory | year = 1999 | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 545–559 | doi = 10.1177/0090591799027004006 | s2cid = 144841050 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sexologists, especially earlier on in the 20th century, viewed gay men and lesbians as "gender inverts". This idea was seen in figures in 1950s New York gay culture: effeminate men referred to as "fairies", as well as butch lesbians. Drag shows also can be considered a way that modifying one's gender expression can indicate their sexuality, though this is not always the case.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hillman |first=Betty Luther |date=January 2011 |title="The most profoundly revolutionary act a homosexual can engage in": Drag and the Politics of Gender Presentation in the San Francisco Gay Liberation Movement, 1964–1972 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40986358 |journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=153–181 |jstor=40986358 |pmid=21488422 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research proved a similar idea, showing that homosexual people are generally more gender nonconforming than heterosexual people, and gender nonconformity throughout life can be an indicator of sexuality.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |date=1 January 2020 |title=Femininity in men and masculinity in women is positively related to sociosexuality |url=http://rave.ohiolink.edu/ejournals/article/369609370 |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=152 |pages=1–5 |via=OhioLINK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discrimination ==
People sometimes face discrimination because of their gender expression. Victims of discrimination often culturally express different genders than their gender identity or biological sex. Gender expression-based discrimination can be independent of sexual orientation, and it can lead to bullying, childhood abuse, sexual assault, discrimination, and various other traumatizing hardships.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Lehavot |first1=Keren |last2=Molina |first2=Yamile |last3=Simoni |first3=Jane M. |date=1 September 2012 |title=Childhood Trauma, Adult Sexual Assault, and Adult Gender Expression among Lesbian and Bisexual Women |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-012-0171-1 |journal=Sex Roles |language=en |volume=67 |issue=5 |pages=272–284 |doi=10.1007/s11199-012-0171-1 |pmid=24003263 |pmc=3758810 |issn=1573-2762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discrimination based on sexual orientation can be connected to a person's gender expression. Scholars say it is difficult to separate the connection between anti-LGBTQ discrimination and gender expression, especially when the expression differs from the person's assigned gender at birth. In a study done by Steph M. Anderson, she found that in discriminatory situations, participants' gender affected whether or not they were perceived as LGBTQ. People whose expression aligned with their assigned gender felt less of an impact than those whose expression did not align with their assigned gender.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Anderson |first=Steph M. |date=September 2020 |title="Gender Matters: The Perceived Role of Gender Expression in Discrimination Against Cisgender and Transgender LGBQ Individuals" |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0361684320929354 |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=323–341 |doi=10.1177/0361684320929354 |s2cid=221217350 |via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to health care, one study shows that people with a non-normative gender expression experienced biases during their care. For example, lesbians who presented femininely may be more comfortable in healthcare spaces than people whose expression does not match their assigned gender. Some gender non-conforming people in the study expressed feelings that having one's gender or sexuality assumed because of their expression limited their comfort and access to healthcare.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal |date=September 2019 |title="Automatic assumption of your gender, sexuality and sexual practices is also discrimination": Exploring sexual healthcare experiences and recommendations among sexually and gender diverse persons in Arctic Canada. |url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=138203849&amp;site=ehost-live |journal=Health &amp; Social Care in the Community |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=1204–1213 |via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender expression is a sizable aspect of how a person views themselves, and thus will impact self confidence. When an individual is forced, for personal or societal influences, to portray themselves in a manner they do not personally identify with, confidence can be greatly hindered in turn damaging mental health. A 2017 study reported that when masculine presenting lesbians are made to dress in a feminine style, their confidence suffers greatly.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Henrichs-Beck|first1=Christine L. |last2=Szymanski |first2=Dawn M. |date=2017 |title=Gender expression, body–gender identity incongruence, thin ideal internalization, and lesbian body dissatisfaction. |url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/sgd0000214 |journal=Psychology of Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity |language=en|volume=4|issue=1|pages=23–33|doi=10.1037/sgd0000214|s2cid=151550839|issn=2329-0390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other, rarer terms exist for aspects of gender expression.
