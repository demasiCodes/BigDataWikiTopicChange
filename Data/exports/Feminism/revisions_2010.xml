'''Feminism''' refers to [[feminist movement|movements]] aimed at establishing and defending equal political, economic, and social rights and equal opportunities for women.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/feminism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/feminism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861610952&lt;/ref&gt; Its concepts overlap with those of [[women's rights]]. Feminism is controversial for challenging traditions in many fields and especially for supporting shifting the political balance toward women.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} Some feminists argue that men cause and benefit from [[sexism]]{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}.  Others argue that gender, like sex, are social constructions that harm all people; feminism thus seeks to liberate men as well as women.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith 1992 ''Bodies that Matter''  London: Routledge. 4-12&lt;/ref&gt; '''Feminists''', persons practicing feminism, can be persons of either sex. 

[[Feminist theory]] emerged from these feminist movements&lt;ref name="Chodorow1989"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Chodorow, Nancy |title=Feminism and Psychoanalytic Theory |year=1989 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn. |isbn=978-0-300-05116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gilligan1977"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gilligan |first=Carol |year=1977 |title='In a Different Voice: Women's Conceptions of Self and Morality'|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=47|issue=4 |pages=481–517|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ174986&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ174986 |doi=|oclc = |accessdate=2008-06-08 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and includes general theories and theories about the origins of inequality, and, in some cases, about the social construction of sex and gender, in a variety of disciplines. Feminist activists have campaigned for women's rights—such as in contract, property, and [[women's suffrage|voting]]—while also promoting women's rights to bodily integrity and autonomy and [[reproductive rights]]. They have opposed [[domestic violence]], [[sexual harassment]], and [[sexual assault]]. In economics, they have advocated for workplace rights, including [[equal pay for women|equal pay]] and opportunities for careers and to start businesses.

The movements and theoretical developments were historically led predominantly by middle-class white women from Western Europe and North America, but, since then, [[feminism#Criticisms by women of colour, with lower incomes, or not Western|more women]] have proposed additional feminisms.

== History ==
{{Main|History of feminism}}

[[File:Louise Weiss.jpg|thumb|left|[[Louise Weiss]] along with other Parisian suffragettes in 1935. The newspaper headline reads, in translation, "THE FRENCHWOMAN MUST VOTE".]]

[[Protofeminism]] preceded feminism and is based on sources other than feminists' writings. Feminists' writings then began to appear, such as those by [[Christine de Pizan]] in the 15th century and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] in the late 18th century. Starting in the 19th century, feminism tended to arise in what we now refer to as waves, especially in the United States and the United Kingdom. [[First-wave feminism]] sought equality in property rights, changes in the marriage relationship, and, eventually, in women's suffrage, or women's right to vote. [[Second-wave feminism]], also sometimes called women's liberation, began in the 1960s and focused on discrimination and on cultural, social, and political issues, and books about it included ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' and ''[[The Second Sex]]''. It was often accused of orienting to upper middle-class white women and, sometimes, of biological essentialism. [[Third-wave feminism]] began in the 1980s or early 1990s and addresses feminism across class and race lines, as being grounded in culture rather than biology, and through many issues, so there's less concentration on particular issues.

[[Post-feminism]] is, depending on the participant, either a later development of feminism or a denial that feminism has any continuing justification, so not all feminists consider post-feminism a part of feminism, some viewing it rather as a critique of feminism.&lt;ref name=Wright2000&gt;{{cite book |author=Wright, Elizabeth |title=Lacan and Postfeminism (Postmodern Encounters) |year=2000 |publisher=Totem Books |location=New York |isbn=978-1-84046-182-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical schools ==
{{Main|Feminist theory}}

[[Feminist theory]] aims to understand [[gender difference]] and [[gender inequality]] and focuses on gender politics and sexuality. Providing a critique of these social and political power relations, much of feminist theory focuses on the promotion of women's rights. Themes explored in feminist theory include [[discrimination]], [[stereotyping]], [[objectification]] (especially [[sexual objectification]]), [[oppression]], and [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref name="Chodorow1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gilligan1977" /&gt; Feminist theory is academically concentrated in [[women's studies]] and encompasses work in [[feminist history|history]], [[feminist anthropology|anthropology]], [[feminist sociology|sociology]], [[feminist economics|economics]], [[feminist literary criticism|literary criticism]],&lt;ref name="Zajko"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Zajko, Vanda |coauthors=Leonard, Miriam |title=Laughing with Medusa: Classical Myth and Feminist Thought |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-927438-X |page=445}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howe"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Howe, Mica; Aguiar, Sarah Appleton |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=He Said, She Says: An RSVP to the Male Text |year=2001 |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |location=Madison [[N.J.]] |isbn=0-8386-3915-1 |page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; (supported by [[women's writing|women's literature]], [[women's music|music]], [[women's cinema|film]], and other [[:Category:Women's media|media]]), [[Art history#Psychoanalytic art history|art history]],&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive'' (Routledge, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feminist theory#Feminist psychoanalysis|psychoanalysis]],&lt;ref name="matrixial_borderspace"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Ettinger, Bracha |authorlink=Bracha Ettinger |coauthors=Judith Butler, Brian Massumi, Griselda Pollock |title=The Matrixial Borderspace |year=2006 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn=0-8166-3587-0 |page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[feminist theology|theology]], [[feminist philosophy|philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;Brabeck, M., and Brown, L., with Christian, L., Espin, O., Hare-Mustin, R., Kaplan, A., Kaschak, E., Miller, D., Phillips, E., Ferns, T., and Van Ormer, A.

== Movements and ideologies ==
Several overlapping [[feminist movements and ideologies|movements of feminist ideologies]] have developed over the years.

[[Liberal feminism]] seeks individualistic equality of men and women through political and legal reform without altering the structure of society.

[[Socialist feminism]] connects oppression of women to exploitation, oppression, and labor. [[Marxist]] feminists feel that overcoming class oppression overcomes gender oppression;&lt;ref name="Marx"&gt;Marx, Karl, trans. B. Fowkes, ''Capital'' (Penguin Classics, 1990 (ISBN 978-0-14-044568-8)).&lt;/ref&gt; some socialist feminists disagree.&lt;ref name="round-table_discussion"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Connolly |first=Clara | number = 23 |coauthors=Lynne Segal, Michele Barrett, Beatrix Campbell, Anne Phillips, Angela Weir, Elizabeth Wilson |title=Feminism and Class Politics: A Round-Table Discussion |journal=Feminist Review |issue=Socialist-Feminism: Out of the Blue |page=17 |month=Summer |year=1986 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radical feminism]] considers the male-controlled [[capitalism|capitalist]] hierarchy as the defining feature of women's oppression and the total uprooting and reconstruction of society as necessary&lt;ref name="Echols" /&gt; and has branched into such as [[anti-pornography feminism]], opposed by [[sex-positive feminism]]. [[Anarcha-feminism|Anarcha-feminist]]s believe that [[class struggle]] and [[anarchism|anarchy]] against the [[Sovereign state|State]]&lt;ref name="farrow"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Dunbar-Ortiz, Roxanne |title=Quiet Rumours |publisher=AK Press |isbn=978-1-902593-40-1 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; require struggling against [[patriarchy]], which comes from involuntary hierarchy.

Lesbian feminism is thus closely related. Some writers criticize separatist feminism as sexist.

[[Eco-feminist|Ecofeminist]]s see men's control of land as responsible for the oppression of women and destruction of the [[ecology|natural environment]], but a criticism is that [[ecofeminism]] focuses too much on a mystical connection between women and nature.&lt;ref name="Biehl"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Biehl, Janet |authorlink=Janet Biehl |title=Rethinking Eco-Feminist Politics |year=1991 |publisher=South End Press |location=Boston, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-89608-392-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Movements share some perspectives while disagreeing on others. For example, some consider men oppressed by gender roles&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Faludi|Faludi, Susan]], ''[[Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man]]'' (1999 (pbk. 2000)).&lt;/ref&gt; while others consider men primarily the causative agents of sexism.&lt;ref name="MaryDaly-GynEcology-pp-27-29-35-105"&gt;Daly, Mary, ''Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism'' (Boston, Mass.: Beacon Press, pbk.

== Societal impact ==
{{Main|Feminist effects on society}}

The [[feminist movement]] has effected change in Western society, including [[women's suffrage]]; in education; in [[gender neutrality in English]]; [[Equal pay for women|job pay more nearly equal to men's]]; the right to initiate divorce proceedings; the [[reproductive rights]] of women to make individual decisions on pregnancy (including access to [[contraceptive]]s and [[abortion]]); and the right to enter into contracts and own property.&lt;ref name="Butler2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Messer-Davidow" /&gt; Feminists have struggled to protect women and girls from [[domestic violence]], [[sexual harassment]], and [[sexual assault]],&lt;ref name="Echols"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Echols, Alice |authorlink=Alice Echols |title=Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967–1975 |year=1989 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn=0-8166-1787-2 |page=416}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cornell" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnesty.org/en/campaigns/stop-violence-against-women/issues/implementation-existing-laws ''Campaign: Stop Violence against Women''].&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizing the grounds as women's rights, rather than as men's traditional interests in families' safety for reproductive purposes.

From the 1960s on, the campaign for [[women's rights]]&lt;ref name="quarterly"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Lockwood, Bert B. |title=Women's Rights: A Human Rights Quarterly Reader |year=2006 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0-8018-8374-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; was met with mixed results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jofreeman.com/feminism/suffrage.htm |title=FROM SUFFRAGE TO WOMEN'S LIBERATION: FEMINISM IN TWENTIETH CENTURY AMERICA by Jo Freeman}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the U.S. and the U.K. Other countries of the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] agreed to ensure that discriminatory laws would be phased out across the European Community.

In the U.S., the [[National Organization for Women]] ([[National Organization for Women|NOW]]) began in 1966 to seek women's equality, including through the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] ([[Equal Rights Amendment|ERA]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.now.org/history/purpos66.html|title=The National Organization for Women's 1966 Statement of Purpose}}&lt;/ref&gt; which did not pass, although [[Equal Rights Amendment#State constitutions|some states enacted their own]].

[[Reproductive rights]] in the U.S. centered on the court decision in [[Roe v. Wade|''Roe'' v. ''Wade'']] enunciating a woman's right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term. Western women gained more reliable [[birth control]], allowing family planning and careers. The movement started in the 1910s in the U.S. under [[Margaret Sanger]] and elsewhere under [[Marie Stopes]] and grew in the late 20th century.

The [[division of labor]] within [[household]]s was affected by the increased entry of women into workplaces in the 20th century. Sociologist [[Arlie Russell Hochschild]] found that, in two-career couples, men and women, on average, spend about equal amounts of time working, but women still spend more time on housework,&lt;ref name="Hochschild1"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Hochschild, Arlie Russell |coauthors=Machung, Anne |title=The Second Shift |year=2003 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York  |isbn=978-0-14-200292-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hochschild2"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Hochschild, Arlie Russell |title=The Time Bind: When Work Becomes Home and Home Becomes Work |year=2001 |publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co. |location=New York  |isbn=978-0-8050-6643-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Cathy Young]] responded by arguing that women may prevent equal participation by men in housework and parenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/mwt/feature/2000/06/12/gatekeeping/index.html |title=The Mama Lion at the Gate |accessdate=2008-07-08 |publisher=Salon.com |author=Young, Cathy |authorlink=Cathy Young}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although research suggests that, to an extent, both women and men perceive feminism to be in conflict with romance, studies of undergraduates and older adults have shown that feminism has positive impacts on relationship health for women and sexual satisfaction for men, and found no support for negative stereotypes of feminists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |author=Rudman, Laurie A.   | coauthor= Phelan, Julie E.  |title=The Interpersonal Power of Feminism: Is Feminism Good for Romantic Relationships? |journal=Sex Roles  |volume=57 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/6163700x51t5r169/ |month=December |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-07-08  |doi=10.1007/s11199-007-9319-9  |page=787  | issue = 11–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In international law, the ''[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]]'' (CEDAW) is an international convention adopted by the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] and described as an international [[bill of rights]] for women.

In religion, [[feminist theology]] reconsiders the traditions, practices, [[scripture]]s, [[sacred text]]s, and theologies of religions from a feminist perspective.&lt;ref name="Parsons"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Parsons | first=Susan Frank | authorlink=Susan Frank Parsons | coauthors= | title=The Cambridge Companion to Feminist Theology | year=2002 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge, UK  | isbn=978-0-521-66380-9 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Loades"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Loades, Ann; Armstrong, Karen | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=Feminist Theology: A Reader | year=1990 | publisher=SPCK  | location=London  | isbn=978-0-664-25129-1 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Watson | first=Natalie K. | authorlink=Natalie K.

Most [[Christian feminism|Christian feminist]]s agree that God does not discriminate by sex. [[New feminism]] is a branch of [[difference feminism]] within Catholicism. [[Islamic feminism]] aims for full equality in public and private life, highlights the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the [[Quran]], encourages questioning patriarchal interpretation of Islamic teaching. and draws on secular and Western feminist discourses. [[Jewish feminism]] addresses all major branches of [[Judaism]] to open up all-male [[minyan|prayer group]]s, end exemption from positive time-bound [[Mitzvah|mitzvot]], and enable women to function as witnesses and to initiate [[Jewish view of marriage#Divorce|divorce]]. The [[Dianic Wicca]]n feminism, one faith of many in [[Wicca]], is female-focused and [[Goddess movement|Goddess]]-centered and teaches witchcraft as every woman's right. In [[Wicca]], "the Goddess" is a deity of prime importance, along with her consort the [[Horned God]]. In the earliest Wiccan publications, she is described as a tribal goddess of the witch community, neither omnipotent nor universal, and it was recognised that there was a greater "[[Cosmological argument|Prime Mover]]", although the witches did not concern themselves much with this being. [[Atheist feminism]] objects to sexism in all major religions.

=== Distinction between sex and gender ===
The [[Sex and gender distinction|distinction between ''sex'' and ''gender'']] is generally that ''sex'' is biological (e.g., chromosomal or morphological) while ''gender'' is social or cultural (e.g., how societies structure relationships).&lt;ref&gt;[[Shira Tarrant|Tarrant, Shira]], ''When Sex Became Gender'' (Routledge, 2006),&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Architecture ===
Gender-based inquiries into and conceptualization of architecture have also come about, leading to [[Feminism and modern architecture|feminism in modern architecture]]. Piyush Mathur coined the term "archigenderic". Claiming that "architectural planning has an inextricable link with the defining and regulation of gender roles, responsibilities, rights, and limitations", Mathur came up with that term "to explore...the meaning of 'architecture' in terms of gender" and "to explore the meaning of 'gender' in terms of architecture".&lt;ref&gt;Mathur, Piyush, in ''Women's Writing'', p.&amp;nbsp;71 (1998) (British journal) (article).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's writing===
[[Image:VirginiaWoolf.PNG|thumb|[[Virginia Woolf]]]]
{{details|Women's writing in English|Women's literature written in English}}
Women's writing came to exist as a separate category of scholarly interest relatively recently. In the West, second-wave feminism prompted a general reevaluation of women's historical contributions, and various academic sub-disciplines, such as [[Women's history]] (or [[herstory]]) and women's writing, developed in response to the belief that women's lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name=Blain&gt;{{cite book |author=Blain, Virginia |coauthors=Clements, Patricia; Grundy, Isobel |title=The feminist companion to literature in English: women writers from the Middle Ages to the present |year=1990 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-04854-8 |pages=1231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virginia Balisn et al. characterize the growth in interest since 1970 in women's writing as "powerful".&lt;ref name=Blain/&gt; Much of this early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women. Studies such as Dale Spender's ''Mothers of the Novel'' (1986) and Jane Spencer's ''The Rise of the Woman Novelist'' (1986) were ground-breaking in their insistence that women have always been writing. Commensurate with this growth in scholarly interest, various presses began the task of reissuing long-out-of-print texts. Virago Press began to publish its large list of nineteenth and early-twentieth-century novels in 1975 and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation. In the 1980s Pandora Press, responsible for publishing Spender's study, issued a companion line of eighteenth-century novels written by women.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra M.

====Feminist science fiction====
{{main|Feminist science fiction}}
In the 1960s the genre of science fiction combined its sensationalism with political and technological critiques of society. With the advent of feminism, questioning women’s roles became fair game to this "subversive, mind expanding genre".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Clute, John |coauthors=Nicholls, Peter |title=The Encyclopedia of science fiction |year=1995 |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |location=New York |isbn=0-312-13486-X |pages=1386}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two early texts are [[Ursula K. Le Guin|Ursula K. Le Guin's]] ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' (1969) and [[Joanna Russ]]' ''[[The Female Man]]'' (1970). They serve to highlight the socially constructed nature of gender roles by creating [[utopia]]s that do away with gender.&lt;ref&gt;Elyce Rae Helford, in Westfahl, Gary.

Another major work of feminist science fiction has been&lt;ref&gt;Sturgis, Susanna. Octavia E.

===Riot grrrl movement===
{{main|Riot Grrrl}}
[[Riot grrrl]] (or riot grrl) is an underground feminist [[Punk rock|punk]] movement that started in the 1990s and is often associated with [[third-wave feminism]] (it is sometimes seen as its starting point). It was Grounded in the [[DIY ethic|DIY philosophy]] of [[Punk ideologies#Punk ethics|punk values]].

=== Sexuality ===
[[Lesbian]]ism and [[bisexuality]] were accepted as part of feminism by a significant proportion of feminists, while others considered sexuality irrelevant to the attainment of other goals. Sexuality, sexual representation, [[sadomasochism]], the role of [[transwomen]] in the lesbian community, and other sexual issues arose within acrimonious feminist debates known as the [[feminist sex wars]].

Opinions on the [[sex industry]] are diverse. They are generally either critical of it (seeing it as exploitative, a result of patriarchal social structures and reinforcing sexual and cultural attitudes that are complicit in [[rape]] and [[sexual harassment]]) or supportive of at least parts of it (arguing that some forms of it can be a medium of feminist expression and a means of women taking control of their sexuality).

===Pornography===
{{details|Feminist sex wars}}
{{see also|Anti-pornography#Feminist objections|Sex-positive feminism}}
The "Feminist Sex Wars" is a term for the acrimonious debates within the feminist movement in the late 1970s through the 1980s around the issues of feminism, sexuality, sexual representation, [[pornography]], [[sadomasochism]], the role of [[transwomen]] in the lesbian community, and other sexual issues. The debate pitted [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography feminism]] against [[sex-positive feminism]], and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates.&lt;ref name=Duggan&gt;{{cite book |author=Duggan, Lisa; Hunter, Nan D. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Sex wars: sexual dissent and political culture |year=1995 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0-415-91036-6 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{cite book |author=Hansen, Karen Tranberg; |coauthors=Philipson, Ilene J. |title=Women, class, and the feminist imagination: a socialist-feminist reader |year=1990 |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=0-87722-630-X |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerhard&gt;{{cite book |author=Gerhard, Jane F. |title=Desiring revolution: second-wave feminism and the rewriting of American sexual thought, 1920 to 1982 |year=2001 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-231-11204-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leidholdt&gt;{{cite book |author=Leidholdt, Dorchen; |authorlink=Dorchen Leidholdt |coauthors=Raymond, Janice G |title=The Sexual liberals and the attack on feminism |year=1990 |publisher=Pergamon Press |location=New York |isbn=0-08-037457-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vance&gt;{{cite book |author=Vance, Carole S. |title=Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality |publisher=Thorsons Publishers|isbn=0-04-440593-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prostitution and trafficking ====
{{Main|Feminist views on prostitution}} 
Feminsts' views on prostitution vary, but many of these perspectives can be loosely arranged into an overarching standpoint that is generally either critical or supportive  of prostitution and [[sex work]].&lt;ref&gt;O’Neill, Maggie (2001) ''Prostitution and Feminism''. Polity Press: Cambridge pp. 14-16&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-prostitution feminists are strongly opposed to prostitution, as they see the practice as a form of violence against and exploitation of women, and a sign of male dominance over women. Feminists who hold such views on prostitution include [[Kathleen Barry]], [[Melissa Farley]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/faq/000008.html Prostitution: Factsheet on Human Rights Violations]. Prostitution Research &amp; Education.

Retrieved on 2009-09-03.&lt;/ref&gt;; the [[European Women's Lobby]] has also condemned prostitution as "an intolerable form of male violence".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.womenslobby.eu/spip.php?article472&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

Other feminists hold that prostitution and other forms of [[sex work]] can be valid choices for women and men who choose to engage in it. In this view, prostitution must be differentiated from forced prostitution, and feminists should support [[sex workers' rights|sex worker activism]] against abuses by both the sex industry and the legal system. The disagreement between these two feminist stances has proven particularly contentious, and may be comparable to the [[feminist sex wars]] of the late twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Priscilla (1997) ''Feminism, Sex Workers and Human Rights'' in Nagle, Jill (ed.) Whores and Other Feminists. Routledge: New York: pp. 83-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to political movements ==
In the U.S., feminism, when politically active, formerly aligned largely with the [[right-wing politics|political right]], e.g., through the [[National Woman's Party]], from the 1910s to the 1960s, and presently aligns largely with the [[left-wing politics|left]], e.g., through the [[National Organization for Women]], of the 1960s to the present, although in neither case has the alignment been consistent.

=== Socialism ===
Since the early twentieth century, some feminists have allied with [[socialism]]. In 1907, at an International Conference of Socialist Women in [[Stuttgart]], suffrage was described as a tool of class struggle. [[Clara Zetkin]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] called for women's suffrage to build a "''socialist order, the only one that allows for a radical solution to the women's question''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxismo.net/idm/idm5/idm5.htm |title=Rossi, Elisabetta.

Femminista Senza Frontiere |year=1994 |publisher=University of Michigan |isbn=8885378536 |page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, the women's movement was allied with the [[Labour party (UK)|Labour party]]. In the U.S., [[Betty Friedan]] emerged from a radical background to take leadership. [[Radical Women]] is the oldest socialist feminist organization in the U.S. and is still active.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= |coauthors= |title=The Radical Women Manifesto: Socialist Feminist Theory, Program and Organizational Structure |year=2001 |publisher=Red Letter Press |location=Seattle, WA  |isbn=0-932323-11-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Spanish Civil War]], [[Dolores Ibárruri]] (''La Pasionaria'') led the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]]. Although she supported equal rights for women, she opposed women fighting on the front and clashed with the [[Anarcha-Feminism|anarcha-feminist]] [[Mujeres Libres]].&lt;ref name="Ib"&gt;{{Cite book |author=IbÃ¡rruri, Dolores |title=Speeches &amp; Articles, 1936–1938 |year=1938 |publisher=University of Michigan |page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Latin America, revolutions brought changes in women's status in countries such as [[Role of women in Nicaraguan Revolution|Nicaragua]], where [[feminist ideology during the Sandinista Revolution]] aided women's quality of life but fell short of achieving a social and ideological change.&lt;ref name="parpart"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Parpart, Jane L. |coauthors=Connelly, M.

The end of Communist governments led to changes in [[gender roles in Eastern Europe after Communism|Eastern European gender roles]].

=== Fascism ===
[[Nazi Germany]] and the contemporary [[fascist]] states illustrate the disastrous consequences for society of a state ideology that, in glorifying traditional images of women, becomes anti-feminist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Bridenthal, Renate |coauthors=Grossmann, Atina; Kaplan, Marion A. |title=When Biology Became Destiny: Women in Weimar and Nazi Germany |year=1984 |publisher=Monthly Review Press |location=New York |isbn=0-85345-642-9 |page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, after the rise of [[Nazism]] in 1933, there was a rapid dissolution of the political rights and economic opportunities that feminists had fought for during the prewar period and to some extent during the 1920s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In Franco's Spain, the right-wing Catholic conservatives undid the work of feminists during the Republic.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Fascist society was hierarchical with an emphasis and idealization of virility, with women maintaining a position largely subordinate to men's.&lt;ref name="hww5"&gt;{{cite book |author=Duby, Georges |coauthors=Perrot, Michelle; Pantel, Pauline, Schmitt |title=A History of Women in the West |year=1994 |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=0-674-40369-X |page=600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Fascism, for its part, attracted many women to its ranks.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Gottlieb | first = Julie | authorlink = | title = Feminine Fascism—Women in Britain's Fascist Movement | publisher =  IB Taurus &amp; Co Ltd | year = 2003 | location = | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, three prominent suffragette leaders (Mary Allen, [[Mary Richardson]], and [[Norah Elam]]) used militant tactics to get votes for women in Britain in the early 1900s, and that had earned them [[Holloway (HM Prison)|Holloway prison]] terms, where they underwent hunger and thirst strikes and force feeding in the cause. During the 1930s, all three became prominent leaders in [[Oswald Mosley]]'s [[British Union of Fascists]] (BUF). Elam became a BUF propagandist, driven by her disillusionment with what she saw as the antiquated Party political system that then dominated. She asserted that women had been given the vote simply to patronize and shut them up, making them think they were taking part in democratic decision-making, and then shrewdly sidelining them and making them politically impotent. Her Fascist propaganda bitterly criticized fellow suffragettes for giving up the feminist agenda and returned time and again to a concern with women's lack of freedom and the lack of influence that any one individual can exert through voting alone. The alternative to democracy she believed the BUF offered was not simply a vague utopian vision. She referred to the practical ideology underlying her Fascist concept. This New Creed, she believed, came in the form of a "Corporate State" which would deliver real equality and participation for all citizens, Corporatism being a system in which various groups in society (economic sectors and professional specializations) are conceived as the essential parts of the state making up the whole, the organs making up the body. The British House of Commons would be made up of representatives from each Corporation. She detailed little.&lt;ref name="McPherson &amp; McPherson"&gt;{{Cite book | last = McPherson | first = Angela | authorlink = | coauthors = McPherson, Susan| title = Mosley's Old Suffragette—A Biography of Norah Elam | publisher = | year = 2010 | location = | pages =  | url = http://www.oldsuffragette.mcpherson.org.uk | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-1-4452-7308-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she was put forward as a candidate for a Parliamentary seat in Northampton in 1936, Mosley accompanied her to Northampton to introduce her to her electorate at a meeting in the Town Hall, where in a public meeting he announced that "[h]e was glad indeed to have the opportunity of introducing the first candidate, and it killed for all time the suggestion that National Socialism proposed putting British women back into the home.  Mrs Elam had fought in the past for women's suffrage ... and was a great example of the emancipation of women in Britain".&lt;ref name="McPherson &amp; McPherson" /&gt; Whether this idea of a Corporate State would ever have produced for women the power to influence public life in the way Elam hoped was never realised in Britain. [[World War II]] and its aftermath revealed the full horrors of fascism and what it was capable of and coincided with the demise of the BUF, which never actually fought or won any seats in elections.

== Scientific discourse criticism ==
Some feminists, such as [[Evelyn Fox Keller]], criticize traditional [[rhetoric of science|scientific discourse]] as historically biased towards a masculine perspective,&lt;ref name="shildrick" /&gt; including the idea of [[scientific objectivity]]. [[Primatologist]] [[Sarah Blaffer Hrdy]] notes the prevalence of masculinely coined stereotypes and theories, such as of the non-sexual female, despite "the accumulation of abundant openly available evidence contradicting it".&lt;ref name="Hrdy"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Blaffer Hrdy |first=Sarah |title=Infanticide: Comparative and Evolutionary Perspectives: Mother Nature: A History of Mothers, Infants and Natural Selection |publisher=Pantheon, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many feminist scholars rely on qualitative scientific research methods that emphasize women's subjective and individual experiences, including treating research participants as authorities equal to the researcher. Objectivity is eschewed in favor of open self-reflexivity and the agenda of helping women. Also, part of the feminist research agenda is the uncovering of ways in which power inequities are created and/or reinforced in society and in scientific and academic institutions. A feminist approach to research often involves nontraditional forms of presentation.&lt;ref name="QCommRsrch"&gt;[[Thomas R. Lindlof|Lindlof, Thomas R.]], &amp; [[Bryan C. Taylor|Taylor, Bryan C.]], ''Qualitative Communication Research Methods'' (Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications, 2002 (978-0-7619-2493-7)), p. 357 (authors communication scholars).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biology of gender ===
Modern feminist science challenges the [[biology of gender|biological essentialist view of gender]]. However, it is increasingly interested in the study of [[sexual differentiation|biological sex differences]] and their effect on [[human behavior]]. For example, [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]]'s book, ''Myths of Gender'', explores the assumptions embodied in scientific research that purports to support a biologically [[essentialist]] view of gender.&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Fausto-Sterling, Anne |title=Myths of Gender: Biological Theories About Women and Men |year=1992 |publisher=BasicBooks |location=New York, New York  |isbn=0-465-04792-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her second book, ''Sexing the Body'', discussed the alleged possibility of more than two ''true'' biological sexes.  This possibility only exists in yet-unknown extraterrestrial biospheres, as no ratios of true gametes to polar cells other than 4:0 and 1:3 (male and female, respectively) are produced on Earth.  However, in ''The Female Brain'', Louann Brizendine argues that brain differences between the sexes are a biological reality with significant implications for sex-specific functional differences.&lt;ref name="Brizendine"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Brizendine, Louann |title=The Female Brain |year=2007 |publisher=Bantam Press |isbn=9780593058077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Rhoads illustrated sex-dependent differences across a wide scope.&lt;ref name="Rhoads"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Rhoads, Steven E. |title=Taking Sex Differences Seriously |year=2004 |publisher=Encounter Books |location=San Francisco, California  |isbn=978-1-893554-93-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carol Tavris]], in ''The Mismeasure of Woman'', uses psychology and sociology to critique theories that use essentialism and biological [[reductionism]] to explain differences between men and women. She argues that "women are not the better sex, the inferior sex or the opposite sex", rather she contends that there are ever-changing hypotheses that justify inequality and perpetuate stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Tavris"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tavris |first=Carol |title=The Mismeasure of Woman: : Why Women Are Not the Better Sex, Inferior or Opposite Sex |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster, 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolutionary biology ===
Sarah Kember—drawing from numerous areas such as [[evolutionary biology]], [[sociobiology]], [[artificial intelligence]], and [[cybernetics]] in development with a new evolutionism—discusses the biologization of technology. She notes how feminists and sociologists have become suspicious of [[evolutionary psychology]], particularly in as much as sociobiology is subjected to [[complexity]] in order to strengthen sexual difference as [[wiktionary:immutable|immutable]] through pre-existing cultural value judgments about [[human nature]] and [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Kember"&gt;{{Cite journal  |unused_data=DUPLICATE DATA: year=1998  |author=Kember, Sarah |title=Resisting the New Evolutionism |journal=Women: a Cultural Review |year=2001 |volume=12 |month=Spring |page=8  |doi=10.1080/09574040110034075  | issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where feminist theory is criticized for its "false beliefs about human nature", Kember then argues in conclusion that "feminism is in the interesting position of needing to do more biology and evolutionary theory in order not to simply oppose their renewed hegemony, but in order to understand the conditions that make this possible, and to have a say in the construction of new ideas and artefacts."&lt;ref name="Kember" /&gt;

== Health ==
Feminism has led to increased participation by [[Women's health|women in the health care]] they receive (e.g., the book ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]''), deliver (e.g., as doctors and [[Midwifery|midwives]]), and seek (e.g., [[lactivism]]).

Historically, some men have engaged with feminism. Philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] demanded equal rights for women in the 18th century. In 1866, philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] (author of "[[The Subjection of Women]]") presented a women's petition to the British parliament and supported an amendment to the 1867 Reform Bill. Others have lobbied and campaigned against feminism.

=== Men as feminists ===
Some feminist women maintain that identifying and participating as a feminist is the strongest stand men can take in the struggle against sexism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shira Tarrant|Tarrant, Shira]], ''Men and Feminism'' (Seal Press, 2009),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hooks1984"&gt;hooks, bell, ''Men: Comrades in Struggle'', in ''Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center'' (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brod1"&gt;Brod, Harry, ''To Be a Man, or Not to Be a Man—That Is the Feminist Question'', in Digby, Tom, ed., ''Men Doing Feminism'' (NY: Routledge, 1993), 197–212.&lt;/ref&gt; Highlighting critical debates about masculinity and gender, the history of men in feminism, and men's roles in preventing violence and sexual assault, a critical analysis of first-person stories by feminist/profeminist men addresses the question of why men should care about feminism in the first place and lays the foundation for a larger discussion about feminism as an all-encompassing human issue,&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant, Shira, ''Men and Feminism'' (Seal Press, May 2009) (author prof. California State University, Long Beach).&lt;/ref&gt; drawing on earlier work.&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant, Shira, ''Men Speak Out: Views on Gender, Sex, and Power'' (Routledge, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Fidelma Ashe argues that traditional feminist views of male experience and of "men doing feminism" have been monolithic and explores the multiple political discourses and practices of pro-feminist politics and evaluates each strand through an interrogation based upon its effect on feminist politics.&lt;ref name="Ashe1"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Ashe, Fidelma |title=The New Politics of Masculinity |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-415-30275-7 |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ashe2"&gt;{{Cite journal  |unused_data=DUPLICATE DATA: year=1998  |author=Ashe, Fidelma |title=Deconstructing the Experiential Bar |journal=Men and Masculinities |year=2004 |volume=7 |month=Spring |doi=10.1177/1097184X03257524 |page=187 | issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other feminist women argue that men cannot be feminists, being incapable simply because, in terms of their acculturation, they are not women. They maintain that men are granted inherent privileges that prevent them from identifying with feminist struggles, thus making it impossible for them to identify with feminists.&lt;ref name="Funk1"&gt;Funk, Russ Ervin, ''The Power of Naming: Why Men Can't Be Feminists'', in ''Feminista!: The Journal of Feminist Construction'', vol. 1, no. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pro-feminism ===
[[Pro-feminism]] is the support of feminism without implying that the supporter is a member of the [[feminist movement]]. The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering [[sexual harassment]] workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counseling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also are involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, [[men's studies]], and the development of [[gender equality|gender equity]] curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centers. Some activists of both genders will not refer to men as "feminists" at all and will refer to all pro-feminist men as "pro-feminists".&lt;ref name="Lingard-isbnX-p192"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Lingard, Bob |coauthors=Douglas, Peter |title=Men Engaging Feminisms: Pro-Feminism, Backlashes and Schooling |year=1999 |publisher=Open University Press |location=Buckingham, England |isbn=0-335-19818-X |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kimmel-Tide"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Kimmel, Michael S. |authorlink=Michael Scott Kimmel |coauthors=Mosmiller, Thomas E. |title=Against the Tide: Pro-Feminist Men in the United States, 1776–1990: A Documentary History |year=1992 |publisher=Beacon Press |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-8070-6767-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticisms by women of colour, with lower incomes, or not Western ===
During much of its [[history of feminism|history]], [[Feminism#Movements and ideologies|feminist movements]] and [[Feminism#Theoretical schools|theoretical developments]] were led predominantly by middle-class white women from Western Europe and North America.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Walker, Alice |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens: Womanist Prose |year=1983 |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=San Diego |isbn=0-15-144525-7 |page=397}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BFT"&gt;Hill Collins, P., ''Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment'' (New York: Routledge, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Narayan"/&gt; However, at least since [[Sojourner Truth]]'s 1851 speech to American feminists, women of other races have proposed alternative feminisms.&lt;ref name="BFT" /&gt; This trend accelerated in the 1960s with the civil rights movement in the United States and the collapse of European colonialism in Africa, the Caribbean, parts of Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Since that time, women in [[Third World|developing nations]] and [[postcolonialism|former colonies]] and who are of colour or various ethnicities or living in poverty have proposed additional feminisms.&lt;ref name="Narayan" /&gt;

=== Antifeminism ===
[[Antifeminism]] is the opposition to women's equality&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=jWj5OBvTh1IC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=antifeminism+Michael+Kimmel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1YCrTOCTPM_Gswa6-PGgBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=antifeminism%20Michael%20Kimmel&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/?s=antifeminist&lt;/ref&gt; or the opposition to feminism in some or all of its forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50009621/50009621se1 ''The Oxford English Dictionary'' (2nd ed. 1989), entry ''Anti-feminist.'']&lt;/ref&gt; Writers such as [[Camille Paglia]], [[Christina Hoff Sommers]], [[Jean Bethke Elshtain]], and [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]] have been labeled "anti-feminists" by feminists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |unused_data=DUPLICATE DATA: year=2000  |author=Stacey, Judith |title=Is Academic Feminism an Oxymoron?  |journal=Signs  |year=2007 |volume=25  | number = 4 |month=Summer |issue=Feminisms at a Millennium |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |unused_data=DUPLICATE DATA: year=1998  |author=Kamarck Minnich, Elizabeth |title=Review: 'Feminist Attacks on Feminisms: Patriarchy's Prodigal Daughters'  |journal=Feminist Studies  |year=2007 |volume=24 |month=Spring |page=26  | issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daphne Patai]] and Noretta Koertge argue that in this way the term "anti-feminist" is used to silence academic debate about feminism.&lt;ref name="Patai_Koertge"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Patai |first=Daphne |coauthors=Noretta Koertge |title=Professing Feminism: Education and Indoctrination in Women's Studies |isbn=0739104551 |year=2003 |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lanham }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nathanson and Young|Paul Nathanson and Katherine K.
