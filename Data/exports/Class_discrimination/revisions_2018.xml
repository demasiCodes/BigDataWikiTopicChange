'''Class discrimination''', also known as '''classism''', is [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]] on the basis of [[social class]] which still occurs in societies around the world today. It includes individual attitudes, behaviors, systems of policies and practices that are set up to benefit the [[upper class]] at the expense of the [[Under class|lower class]] or vice versa.&lt;ref name=Kadi&gt;{{cite book|last=Kadi|first=Joanna|title=Thinking Class|publisher=[[South End Press]]|year=1996|pages=|url=|isbn=0-89608-548-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Socioeconomic, racial/ethnic and gender inequalities in academic achievement have been widely reported in the United States, but how these three axes of inequality intersect to determine academic and non-academic outcomes among school-aged children is not well understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bécares|first=Laia|last2=Priest|first2=Naomi|date=27 October 2015|title=Understanding the Influence of Race/Ethnicity, Gender, and Class on Inequalities in Academic and Non-Academic Outcomes among Eighth-Grade Students: Findings from an Intersectionality Approach|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141363|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=10|pages=e0141363|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0141363|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Class structures existed in a simplified form in pre-agricultural societies, but it has evolved into a more complex and established following the establishment of permanent agriculture-based civilizations with a food surplus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Brief History of the World Course No. 8080 [Audio CD]|author=Peter N. Stearns (Narrator)|publisher=The Teaching Company|asin=B000W595CC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classism started to be practiced around the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=Serinity|title=Encyclopedia of Women and World Religion|date=1999|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0028648609|page=181|author2=Katie Cannon|editor=Serinity Young|format=Print|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Encyclopedia_of_women_and_world_religion.html?id=RYgYAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institutional versus personal classism ==
The term classism can refer to personal prejudice against lower classes as well as to institutional classism, just as the term [[racism]] can refer either strictly to personal prejudice or to [[institutional racism]]. The former has been defined as "the ways in which conscious or unconscious classism is manifest in the various institutions of our society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gustavus.edu/reslife/documents/Classism.doc|title=Classism Definitions|website=gustavus.edu|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "interpersonal" is sometimes used in place of "personal" as in "institutional classism (versus) interpersonal classism"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Langhout|first=Regina Day|title=Assessing Classism in Academic Settings|date=Winter 2007|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/review_of_higher_education/v030/30.2langhout.html|last2=Rosselli|last3=Feinstein|first2=Francine|first3=Jonathan|journal=The Review of Higher Education|newspaper=|volume=30|issue=2|pages=145–184|doi=10.1353/rhe.2006.0073}}&lt;/ref&gt; and terms such as "attitude" or "attitudinal" may replace "interpersonal" as contrasting with institutional classism as in the Association of Magazine Media's definition of classism as "any attitude or institutional practice which subordinates people due to income, occupation, education and/or their economic condition".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magazine.org/diversity/managing/defining/8478.aspx "Glossary"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309015508/http://www.magazine.org/diversity/managing/defining/8478.aspx|date=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classism is also sometimes broken down into more than two categories as in "personal, institutional and cultural" classism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Adams|editor1-first=Maurianne|editor2-last=Bell|editor2-first=Lee Anne|editor3-last=Griffin|editor3-first=Pat|title=Teaching for Diversity and Social Justice|edition=2nd|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|page=317|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OI-5SlHR9PMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-415-95199-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common knowledge in sociolinguistics that metasocial language abounds in lower registers, thus the slang for various classes or racial castes.

== Media representation ==
Class discrimination can be seen in many different forms of media such as television shows, films and social media. Class discrimination in the media displays the knowledge of what people feel and think about classicism. When seeing class discrimination in films and television shows, people are influenced and believe that is how things are in real life, for whatever class is being displayed. Media is a big influence on the world today, with that something such as classism is can be seen in many different lights. Usually, the lower income people are displayed in the media as dirty, lack of education and manners and homeless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/poverty_prejudice/mediarace/portrayal.htm|title=Portrayal of Minorities in the Film, Media and Entertainment Industries|website=web.stanford.edu|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From both sides of that being displayed in the media, people are able to take what they see, whether that be true or not and believe what they want to believe. People can use the media to learn more about different social classes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criticalmediaproject.org/cml/topicbackground/race-ethnicity/|title=Race &amp; Ethnicity|website=criticalmediaproject.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or use the media, such as social media to influence others on what they believe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.harvard.edu/andresmh/2013/04/classism-accountability-and-social-media/|title=Classism, Accountability, and Social Media|website=blogs.harvard.edu|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, people who are in a social class that is portrayed in a bad way by the media can be effected in school and social life as "[t]eenagers who grew up in poverty reported higher levels of discrimination, and the poorer the teens were, the more they experienced discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.wisc.edu/news-events/social-class-discrimination-contributes-to-poorer-health/38020|title=Social-class discrimination contributes to poorer health|website=wisc.edu|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A concrete example of classism in the media is the fictional character [[Homer_Simpson|Homer Simpson]] from [[The Simpsons]] who is portrayed as a thick, dumb, balding man with lack of education and manners. Another example of classism was identified in a [[YouTube]] video from TheThings titled "10 Hilarious Unanswered Questions About [[Peppa Pig]]" as 'a classist system'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=10 Hilarious Unanswered Questions About Peppa Pig |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1AHZXq5x_8 |website=Youtube |publisher=TheThings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation ==
The [[European Convention on Human Rights]] contains protections against social class discrimination, but only a few signatory states have signed and ratified these protections. Those that have signed and ratified this have implemented domestic laws against favela discrimination because of social class (in the same way that [[race discrimination]], [[sex discrimination]] or [[age discrimination]] have been legislated against).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
