'''Class discrimination''', also known as '''classism''', is [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]] on the basis of [[social class]]. It includes individual attitudes, behaviors, systems of policies, and practices that are set up to benefit the [[upper class]] at the expense of the [[under class|lower class]].

For example, [[American middle class|middle-class]] and [[American upper class|upper-class individuals in the U.S.]] referring to [[working class]], white Americans as "[[White trash|poor white trash]]" can be regarded as a form of class prejudice, the [[insult]] having the capacity to be historically [[analogy|analogous]] to [[Racism in the United States|racist]] language against [[African-Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://warren-wilson.edu/blogs/echo/2008/10/deep-woes-and-prejudices-behind-term-%E2%80%9Cwhite-trash%E2%80%9D/|title=Deep woes and prejudices behind term 'white trash'|author=Ricky Ochilo|date=October 16, 2008|publisher=The Warren Wilson Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=selecting American out of 190 other countries seems WP:OR and pov, besides being US-Centric.

==History==
Class structures existed in a simplified form in pre-agricultural societies, but became much more complex and established following the establishment of permanent agriculture-based civilizations with a food surplus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= A Brief History of the World Course No. 8080 [Audio CD]|author= Peter N.

==Institutional versus personal classism==

The term classism can refer to personal prejudice against lower or upper classes as well as to institutional classism, just as the term [[racism]] can refer either strictly to personal bigotry or to [[institutional racism]]. The former has been defined as "the ways in which conscious or unconscious classism is manifest in the various institutions of our society."&lt;ref&gt;[https://gustavus.edu/reslife/documents/Classism.doc Classism Definitions]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "interpersonal" is sometimes used in place of "personal" as in, "institutional classism (versus) interpersonal classism.",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Classism is also sometimes broken down into more than two categories, as in "personal, institutional and cultural" classism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Terms associated with personal or attitudinal classism include "[[white trash]]", "[[redneck]]", "little men" or "little people", "[[trailer trash]]", "the [[unwashed masses]]", "the great unwashed", "[[moocher]]s", "oiks", "[[proles]]" and "bludgers". In earlier historical periods, classist terms and phrases such as "[[Hoi polloi]]" or "plebs",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20829901|title='Plebgate': Met Police vows 'ruthless' search for truth|date=23 December 2012|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are derogatory towards the [[working-classes]], were more commonly used than they are today.

==Accusations of classism==
People who generally tend to find charges of classism against lower classes to be unfounded or unreasonably harsh often characterize the perceived prejudice as expressive of classist [[class envy]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Those who argue classism is especially pervasive or fundamental to the society that they live in often identify classism as the expression of systematic economic [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] by the higher classes, and may connect it with an explicit notion of [[class conflict|class warfare]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} However, any particular accusation of classism does not, ''as such'', presuppose any such claim, just as people may agree on examples of overt racism, while disagreeing intensely over how widespread or deep-seated racist attitudes are in their society.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Legislating against class discrimination==
The [[European Convention on Human Rights]] contains protections against social class discrimination. Only a few signatory states have signed and ratified these protections. Those that have signed and ratified this have implemented domestic laws against discrimination because of social class (in the same way that [[race discrimination]], [[sex discrimination]] or [[age discrimination]] have been legislated against).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
