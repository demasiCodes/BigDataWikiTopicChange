'''''Classism''''' is [[prejudice]] and/or [[discrimination]] on the basis of [[social class]]. It includes individual attitudes and behaviors, systems of policies and practices that are set up to benefit the upper classes at the expense of the lower classes.&lt;ref name=Kadi&gt;{{cite book

This system leads to antagonisms and prejudices between members of various classes. {{Fact|date=April 2009}}

==Accusations of classism==
Charges that a person, act or institution is classist often provokes argument. {{Fact|date=April 2009}}There is frequently intense disagreement between the parties over background facts, such as whether modern industrialized societies are [[economic stratification|economically stratified]] into discernible classes (and if so, how much); or if this arrangement leads to classism. There is also often disagreement over matters of understanding, such as whether negative treatment is due to prejudice against members of certain classes, or whether it is a rational reaction to "personal" traits of the person being so treated. 

People who generally tend to find charges of classism against 'lower' classes to be unfounded or unreasonably harsh often characterise the perceived prejudice as expressive of classist [[class envy]]. Those who argue classism is especially pervasive or fundamental to the society that they live in often identify classism as the expression of systematic economic [[exploitation]] by the 'higher' classes, and may connect it with an explicit notion of [[class warfare]] — but it is important to note that any particular accusation of classism does not, ''as such'', presuppose any such claim, just as people may agree on examples of overt [[racism]], while disagreeing intensely over how widespread or deep-seated [[racist]] attitudes are in their society.
