'''Classism''' is [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]] on the basis of [[social class]]. It includes individual attitudes and behaviors, systems of policies and practices that are set up to benefit the upper classes at the expense of the lower classes.&lt;ref name=Kadi&gt;{{cite book

==History==
Class structures existed in a simplified form in pre-agricultural societies, but became much more complex and established following the establishment of permanent agriculture-based civilizations with a food surplus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= A Brief History of the World Course No. 8080 [Audio CD]|author= Peter N. Stearns (Narrator)|publisher= The Teaching Company|asin=B000W595CC}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that one of the first recorded cases of classism involved the diminishment of the original role of [[Siduri]] in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Epic of Gilgamesh, the teachings of Siduri and how Siduri's ancient advice can help guide us to a happier life, Third Edition |author= Peter Dyr|publisher=SW publishers, Los Gatos, California, USA|isbn=9-78-130108347-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional versus personal classism==

The term classism can refer to personal prejudice against 'lower' or 'upper' classes as well as to institutional classism, just as the term [[racism]] can refer either strictly to personal bigotry or to [[institutional racism]]. The former has been defined as "the ways in which conscious or unconscious classism is manifest in the various institutions of our society."&lt;ref&gt;[https://gustavus.edu/reslife/documents/Classism.doc Classism Definitions]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "interpersonal" is sometimes used in place of "personal" as in, "institutional classism (versus) interpersonal classism.",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Classism is also sometimes broken down into more than two categories, as in "personal, institutional and cultural" classism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Terms associated with personal or attitudinal classism include "[[white trash]]",  "[[William J. H. Boetcker|little men]]" or "little people," "trailer trash", "the [[unwashed masses]]", "moochers," and "[[Aussie Slang|bludgers]]". In earlier historical periods, classist terms and phrases as [[Hoi_polloi#Appearances_in_the_nineteenth_century|''hoi polloi'' or plebs]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20829901&lt;/ref&gt; which are "derogatory of the lower classes," were  more commonly used than they are today. Though [[Andrew Mitchell]], former Chief whip of the UK conservative party was forced to resign after allegedly calling a police officer a pleb for refusing to open the gates to [[Downing St]] for him to ride his bike through. Mitchell announced he would sue [[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]] for libel over the allegations in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21969990 Andrew Mitchell to sue Sun newspaper over 'plebgate'] [[BBC News]], 28 March 2013.Retrieved 30 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations of classism==
There is disagreement{{By whom|date=June 2011}} over what degree modern industrialized societies are [[economic stratification|economically stratified]] into discernible classes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} There is also often disagreement over matters of understanding, such as whether negative treatment is due to prejudice against members of certain classes, or whether the behavior is a rational reaction to actions of the person being so treated, or due to racial, ethnic, sexual, or other identity.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

People who generally tend to find charges of classism against 'lower' classes to be unfounded or unreasonably harsh often characterize the perceived prejudice as expressive of classist [[class envy]]. Those who argue classism is especially pervasive or fundamental to the society that they live in often identify classism as the expression of systematic economic [[exploitation]] by the 'higher' classes, and may connect it with an explicit notion of [[class conflict|class warfare]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} However, any particular accusation of classism does not, ''as such'', presuppose any such claim, just as people may agree on examples of overt [[racism]], while disagreeing intensely over how widespread or deep-seated [[racist]] attitudes are in their society.

==Legislating against class discrimination==
The [[European Convention on Human Rights]] contains protections against social class discrimination. Only a few signatory states have signed and ratified these protections. Those that have signed and ratified this have implemented domestic laws against discrimination because of social class (in the same way that [[race discrimination]], [[sex discrimination]] or [[age discrimination]] have been legislated against. However, these laws are often ineffective.
