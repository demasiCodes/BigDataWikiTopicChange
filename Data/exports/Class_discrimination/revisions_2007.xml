{{Discrimination}}

'''''Classism''''' is any form of [[prejudice]] or [[oppression]] against people as a result of their actual or perceived [[social class]] (especially in the form of lower or higher [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] status). It is similar to social [[elitism]].

==Classism==
Charges that a person, act or institution is classist often provoke argument. There is frequently intense disagreement between the parties over background facts, such as whether modern industrialized societies are [[economic stratification|economically stratified]] into discernible classes (and if so, how much); and there is also often disagreement over matters of understanding, such as whether negative treatment is due to prejudice against members of certain classes, or whether it is a rational reaction to "personal" traits of the person being so treated. 

People who generally tend to find charges of classism against 'lower' classes to be unfounded or unreasonably harsh often characterise the perceived prejudice as expressive of [[class envy]]. Those who argue classism is especially pervasive or fundamental to the society that they live in often identify classism as the expression of systematic economic [[exploitation]] by the 'higher' classes, and may connect it with an explicit notion of [[class warfare]] — but it is important to note that any particular accusation of classism does not, ''as such'', presuppose any such claim, just as people may agree on examples of overt [[white supremacism]], while disagreeing intensely over how widespread or deep-seated racist attitudes are in their society.

==Individual versus structural==
Like [[racism]], classism can be divided into (at least) '''individual classism''' and '''structural classism'''. ''Individual'' classism is a matter of the prejudices held and discrimination practiced by ''individual people'' (such as making jokes or stereotypes at those of lower class). 

''Structural'' or ''institutional'' classism is a passive form of classism that occurs when institutions or common practices are structured in such a way as to effectively exclude or marginalize people usually from lower classes, which ''can'' be due, in part, to widespread ''individual'' classism within the organization or the society, but does not ''need'' to be - for example, many people{{Fact|date=April 2007}} see the heavy influence of [[soft money|campaign contributions]] in [[United States|American]] politics as a form of structural classism - since they argue that it effectively excludes working class people from political influence over their elected representatives - but this need not involve any claim that the campaign finance system was ''intentionally designed'' with the aim of disadvantaging the poor.
