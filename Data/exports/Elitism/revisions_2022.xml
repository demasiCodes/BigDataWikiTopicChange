'''Elitism''' is the belief or notion that individuals who form an [[elite]]—a select group of people perceived as having an intrinsic [[quality (philosophy)|quality]], high [[intellect]], [[wealth]], [[power (social and political)|power]], [[notability]], special [[Skill|skills]], or [[experience]]—are more likely to be constructive to society as a whole, and therefore deserve influence or authority greater than that of others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/elitist|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160925233306/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/elitist|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 25, 2016|title=elitist {{!}} Definition of elitist in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=March 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''elitism'' may be used to describe a situation in which power is concentrated in the hands of a limited number of people. Beliefs that are in opposition to elitism include [[egalitarianism]], [[anti-intellectualism]], [[populism]], and the [[political theory]] of [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]].

[[Elite theory]] is the sociological or political science analysis of elite influence in society: elite theorists regard pluralism as a [[utopian ideal]].

Elitism is closely related to [[social class]] and what [[sociologist]]s term "[[social stratification]]". In modern [[Western world|Western societies]], social stratification is typically defined in terms of three distinct [[social class]]es: the [[upper class]], the [[middle class]], and the [[Working class|lower class]].&lt;ref name="Saunders1990"&gt;{{cite book | author-link=Peter Robert Saunders | url=https://archive.org/details/socialclassstrat0000saun | url-access=registration | title=Social Class and Stratification | publisher=Routledge | last=Saunders | first=Peter | year=1990 | isbn=978-0-415-04125-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some [[synonym]]s for "elite" might be "upper-class" or "[[aristocracy|aristocratic]]", indicating that the individual in question has a relatively large degree of control over a society's [[means of production]]. This includes those who gain this position due to socioeconomic means and not personal achievement. However, these terms are misleading when discussing elitism as a political theory, because they are often associated with negative "class" connotations and fail to appreciate a more unbiased exploration of the philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/elitist|title=ELITIST {{!}} meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|language=en|access-date=March 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Attributes that identify an elite vary; personal achievement may not be essential. Elite status ''can'' be based on personal achievement, such as degrees from top-rate universities or impressive internships and job offers, as well as on lineage or passed-on fame from parents or grandparents.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

As a term, "elite" usually describes a person or group of people who are members of the uppermost class of society, and wealth can contribute to that class determination. Personal attributes commonly purported by elitist theorists to be characteristic of the elite include: rigorous study of, or great accomplishment within, a particular field; a long track record of competence in a demanding field; an extensive history of dedication and effort in service to a specific discipline (e.g., medicine or law) or a high degree of accomplishment, training or [[wisdom]] within a given field; a high degree of physical [[discipline]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

Elitists tend to favor social systems such as [[meritocracy]], [[technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocracy]] and [[plutocracy]] as opposed to political [[egalitarianism]] and [[populism]]. Elitists believe only a few "movers and shakers" truly change society, rather than the majority of people who only vote and elect the elites into power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elite (elitist) theory|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/elite_theory|website=auburn.edu|publisher=Auburn University|access-date=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elitism can not be entirely defined in one nature. Its interpretations broaden over time and communities or groups can create their own interpretations of elitism. The common characteristic among all these forms of elitism is that it shows some form of inferiority-superiority.
