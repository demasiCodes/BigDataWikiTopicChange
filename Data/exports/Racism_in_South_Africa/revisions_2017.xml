==Colonial racism==

The establishment of the [[Dutch East India Company]] settlement at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1652 brought with it the established slave labor practices of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iziko.org.za/sh/resources/slavery/slavery_world.html|title=Slavery at the Cape|publisher=Iziko Museums of Cape Town|accessdate=2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these slaves were imported from the company's more established settlements in India and the East Indies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/solidarity/indiasa3.html|title=Indian Slaves in South Africa|publisher=[[African National Congress]]|accessdate=2008-11-19 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080622023927/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/solidarity/indiasa3.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Slavery was by no means restricted to the European slave trade. During the [[Difaqane]], the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] under [[Shaka]] overran many smaller tribes and enslaved them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isic.org/sisp/index.htm?fx=destination&amp;loc_id=131114&amp;section=culture|title=Destinations: South Africa - Pre 20th Century History|publisher=International Student Travel Conveduration|accessdate=2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavery in South Africa was officially [[Abolitionism|abolished]] in 1833 with the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Slavery Abolition Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anti-slaverysociety.addr.com/huk-1833act.htm|title=Slavery Abolition Act 1833|date=1833-10-29|publisher=Houses of Parliament, Palace of Westminster, London.|accessdate=2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many examples of racism and discriminatory practices during the colonial period, such as the allocation of rations during the [[Siege of Ladysmith]]
{{quote|For Whites—Biscuit, 1/4 lb.; Maize meal, 3 oz.&lt;br&gt;
For Indians and Kaffirs(Coloureds)—Maize meal, 8 oz.&lt;br&gt;
Europeans—Fresh meat, 1 lb.&lt;br&gt;
Kaffirs—Fresh meat, 1-1/4 lbs. (Chiefly horseflesh.)&lt;br&gt;
For White men—Coffee or tea, 1/12 oz.; pepper, 1/64 oz.; salt, 1/3 oz.; sugar, 1 oz.; mustard, 1/20 oz.; Vinegar, 1/12 gill.&lt;br&gt;
For Indians—a little rice.| H. W. Nevinson &lt;ref&gt;{{Gutenberg|no=16603|name=Ladysmith, The Diary of a Siege by Henry W. Nevinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Even [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]], who worked to eradicate racism—and in particular racism that affected the Indian communities in South Africa—was prone to making racist remarks during this period. In one of his [[Gandhi#Early South African articles|early articles]] for the ''[[Indian Opinion]]'', he wrote:
{{quote|source=|Kaffirs are as a rule uncivilised—the convicts even more so. They are troublesome, very dirty and live almost like animals.|Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi|volume=8|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==Apartheid racism==

{{See also|South Africa under apartheid}}
Apartheid (Afrikaans pronunciation: {{IPA-af|aˈpartɦəit|}}; an Afrikaans word meaning "separateness", or "the state of being apart", literally "apart-hood") was a system of racial segregation in South Africa enforced through legislation by the National Party (NP), the governing party from 1948 to 1994. Under apartheid, the rights, associations, and movements of the majority black inhabitants and other ethnic groups were curtailed, and white minority rule was maintained. Apartheid was developed after World War II by the [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]]-dominated National Party and Broederbond organizations. The ideology was also enforced in South West Africa, which was administered by South Africa under a League of Nations mandate (revoked in 1966 via United Nations Resolution 2145), until it gained independence as Namibia in 1990. By extension, the term is currently used for forms of systematic segregation established by the state authority in a country against the social and civil rights of a certain group of citizens due to ethnic prejudices.

== Post-Apartheid racism ==

Racial populism and anti-white sentiment is an increasing worry in post-Apartheid South Africa. [[Afrobarometer]] research has indicated that perceptions of discrimination have increased significantly since 2011 amongst citizens from minority race groups, especially among those of Indian ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lekalake|first=Rorisang|last2=Nkomo|first2=Sibusiso|date=2016-04-20|title=South Africans generally tolerant but report racial discrimination by employers and courts|url=http://afrobarometer.org/sites/default/files/publications/Dispatches/ab_r6_dispatchno84-south-africa-discrimination.pdf|journal=The Institute for Justice and Reconciliation|volume=84|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[R. W. Johnson|R.W. Johnson]], although post-Apartheid South Africa initially strove to be a non-racial dispensation under President [[Nelson Mandela]], subsequent presidents [[Thabo Mbeki]] and [[Jacob Zuma]] both mobilised anti-white sentiment in order to maintain political power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/opinion/south-africas-racial-mania|title=South Africa's racial mania|last=Johnson|first=R.W.|date=2016-03-01|website=www.politicsweb.co.za|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been claimed that racism against white people goes largely ignored in South Africa, and that political parties like the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) and the [[Economic Freedom Fighters]] foment discontent and racial animosity for political purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biznews.com/thought-leaders/2017/01/19/van-schalkwyk-anti-white-racism/|title=Rex van Schalkwyk: Anti-white racism - why does it go unpunished in SA?|last=van Schalkwyk|first=Rex|date=2017-01-19|work=BizNews.com|access-date=2017-04-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://africanewswire.za.com/south-africas-zuma-accuses-protesters-of-racism-after-marches/|title=South Africa’s Zuma Accuses Protesters of Racism After Marches – Africa News Wire|website=africanewswire.za.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scapegoating of white South Africans has been likened to Afrikaner antisemitism during Apartheid, which was used to consolidate racial identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/news-and-analysis/are-1652s-the-new-jews|title=Are '1652s' the new Jews?|last=Cardo|first=Michael|date=|website=www.politicsweb.co.za|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, following a series of incidents in which white people were seen to have disparaged black people on social media, commentators, researchers, and politicians noted the outsized outrage displayed by South Africans in response, and worried that anti-racism aimed at whites had turned into a [[moral panic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tonyleon.com/beware-the-moral-panic-that-will-put-sa-on-a-slippery-slope/|title=Beware the 'moral panic' that will put SA on a slippery slope|last=Leon|first=Tony|date=2016-01-31|website=tonyleon.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/opinion/a-descent-into-racial-madness|title=A descent into racial madness|last=Myburgh|first=James|date=2016-01-14|website=www.politicsweb.co.za|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/moral-panic-of-firms-isnt-enough-2030693|title=Moral panic of firms isn’t enough|last=McKaizer|first=Eusebius|date=2016-06-06|work=Independent Online|access-date=2017-05-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thoughtleader.co.za/amandangwenya/2016/01/07/racist-black-south-africans-who-kept-their-jobs%E2%80%A8/|title=‘Racist’ black South Africans who kept their jobs?|last=Ngwenya|first=Gwen|date=2016-01-07|work=The Mail &amp; Guardian|access-date=2017-04-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comparative study by trade union [[Solidarity (South African trade union)|Solidarity]] confirmed that South African media give more attention to white-on-black racism; it also found that the [[South African Human Rights Commission]] is much more likely to self-initiate investigations into white-on-black racism, and is more lenient in cases of black-on-white racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/documents/how-the-response-to-black-and-white-racism-differs|title=How the response to black and white racism differs - Solidarity|last=Brink|first=Eugene|date=2017-04-05|work=Politicsweb|access-date=2017-04-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=Mulder|first2=Connie|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ed Herbst claims that public broadcaster [[South African Broadcasting Corporation|SABC]]'s coverage of racism is skewed so as to portray white South Africans, particularly Afrikaners, as racist oppressors, and black South Africans as their victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biznews.com/undictated/2017/03/20/media-coverage-herbst/|title=A brutal tale of unbalanced, selective, racism-inciting media coverage - Herbst|last=Herbst|first=Ed|date=2017-03-20|work=BizNews.com|access-date=2017-04-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=Bateman|first2=Chris|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farm invasions, torture, and murders, the victims of which are predominantly white, receive little attention or government response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/world-economy/bury-them-alive-white-south-africans-fear-for-their-future-as-horrific-farm-attacks-escalate/news-story/3a63389a1b0066b6b0b77522c06d6476|title=‘Bury them alive!’: White South Africans fear for their future as horrific farm attacks escalate|last=Chung|first=Frank|date=2017-03-25|work=|access-date=2017-04-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Carte Blanche (TV series)|Carte Blanche]] noted that the racial demographics of farm murders are in line with racial representation in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://carteblanche.dstv.com/farm-murders/|title=Farm Murders|last=|first=|date=2017-03-13|work=Carte Blanche|access-date=2017-04-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, ANC officials in government positions began to directly target white people with threats in official speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biznews.com/leadership/2017/04/11/zuma-allies-sa-whites/|title=Zuma allies deliver another menacing threat to SA whites: Things might get ‘very, very rough’|last=Cameron|first=Jackie|date=2017-04-11|work=BizNews.com|access-date=2017-04-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=de Villiers|first2=James|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/sunday-tribune/news/da-opens-assault-and-incitement-charges-against-durban-mayor-8558268|title=DA opens assault and incitement charges against Durban Mayor|last=Mngadi|first=Siboniso|date=2017-04-08|work=|access-date=2017-04-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
