Political repression is sometimes used synonymously with the term political [[discrimination]] (also known as politicism). It often is manifested through [[discrimination|discriminatory]] policies, such as [[human rights]] violations, [[surveillance abuse]], [[police brutality]], [[imprisonment]], [[Involuntary settlements in the Soviet Union|involuntary settlement]], [[Lishenets|stripping of citizen's rights]], [[lustration]] and violent action such as the murder, [[summary execution]]s, [[torture]], [[forced disappearance]] and other [[extrajudicial punishment]] of [[political activist]]s, [[dissident]]s, or general population.

Where political repression is sanctioned and organised by the state, it may constitute [[state terrorism]], [[genocide]], politicide or [[crimes against humanity]]. Systemic and violent political repression is a typical feature of [[dictatorship]]s, [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] states and similar regimes. In such regimes, acts of political repression may be carried out by [[secret police]] forces, army, [[paramilitary]] groups or [[death squad]]s.  Relevant activities have also been found within democratic contexts as well.

If political repression is not carried out with the approval of the state, a section of government may still be responsible. An example is the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[COINTELPRO]] operations in the [[United States]] between 1956 and 1971.

In some states, such as the former [[Soviet Union]], "repression" can be an official term and official [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)|legal policy of repression]] with respect to internal political opponents of the state, see [[Soviet political repression]].

==Data on human rights violation and state repression==

There are currently a wide variety of databases available which attempt to measure, in a rigorous fashion exactly what governments do against those within their territorial jurisdiction.  The list below was created and maintained by Prof. Christian Davenport at the Kroc Institute &amp; the University of Notre Dame.  These efforts vary with regard to the particular form of human rights violation they are concerned with, the source employed for the data collection as well as the spatial and temporal domain of interest.
