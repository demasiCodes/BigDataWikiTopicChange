Political repression may be represented by [[discrimination|discriminatory]] policies, [[surveillance abuse]], [[police brutality]], [[imprisonment]], [[Involuntary settlements in the Soviet Union|involuntary settlement]], [[Lishenets|stripping of citizen's rights]], and violent action such as the murder, [[summary execution]]s, [[torture]], [[forced disappearance]] and other [[extrajudicial punishment]] of [[political activist]]s, [[dissident]]s, or general population. 

Where political repression is sanctioned and organised by the state, it may constitute [[state terrorism]] or [[genocide]]. Systemic and violent political repression is a typical feature of [[dictatorship]]s, [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] states and similar regimes. In such regimes, acts of political repression may be carried out by [[secret police]] forces, army, [[paramilitary]] groups or [[death squad]]s.

If political repression is not carried out with the approval of the state, a section of government may still be responsible. An example is the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[COINTELPRO]] operations in the [[United States]] between 1956 and 1971.

In some states, such as the former [[Soviet Union]], "repression" can be an official term and official [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)|legal policy of repression]] with respect to internal political opponents of the state.
