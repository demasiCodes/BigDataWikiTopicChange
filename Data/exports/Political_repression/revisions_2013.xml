[http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521864909 ''State Repression and the Domestic Democratic Peace''] New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, Christian, Johnston, Hank and Mueller, Carol (2004). [http://www.upress.umn.edu/Books/D/davenport_repression.html ''Repression and Mobilization''] Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political repression is sometimes used synonymously with the term political [[discrimination]] (also known as politicism). It often is manifested through [[discrimination|discriminatory]] policies, such as [[human rights]] violations, [[surveillance abuse]], [[police brutality]], [[imprisonment]], [[Involuntary settlements in the Soviet Union|involuntary settlement]], [[Lishenets|stripping of citizen's rights]], [[lustration]] and violent action or [[terror]] such as the murder, [[summary execution]]s, [[torture]], [[forced disappearance]] and other [[extrajudicial punishment]] of [[political activist]]s, [[dissident]]s, or general population.&lt;ref&gt;Kittrie, Nicholas N. 1995. ''The War Against Authority: From the Crisis of Legitimacy to a New Social Contract. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Where political repression is sanctioned and organised by the state, it may constitute [[state terrorism]], [[genocide]], politicide or [[crimes against humanity]]. Systemic and violent political repression is a typical feature of [[dictatorship]]s, [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] states and similar regimes.&lt;ref&gt;Serge, Victor, 1979, ''What Everyone Should Know About State Repression, London: New Park Publications.''&lt;/ref&gt; Acts of political repression may be carried out by [[secret police]] forces, army, [[paramilitary]] groups or [[death squad]]s.  Repressive activities have also been found within democratic contexts as well.&lt;ref&gt;Donner, Frank J. (1980). ''The Age of Surveillance: The Aims and Methods of America’s Political Intelligence System''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. ISBN 0-394-40298-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donner, Frank J. (1990). ''Protectors of Privilege: Red Squads and Police Repression in Urban America.'' Berkeley: University of California Press. ISBN 0-520-05951-4&lt;/ref&gt; This can even include setting up situations where the death of the target of repression is the end result&lt;ref&gt;Haas, Jeffrey. ''The Assassination of Fred Hampton: How the FBI and the Chicago Police Murdered a Black Panther.'' Chicago, Ill.: Lawrence Hill /Chicago Review, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

If political repression is not carried out with the approval of the state, a section of government may still be responsible. An example is the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[COINTELPRO]] operations in the [[United States]] between 1956 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;''COINTELPRO: The FBI's Covert Action Programs Against American Citizens, Final Report of the Senate Committee to Study Governmental Operations with respect to Intelligence Activities.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, D. 2004. ''There’s something happening here: The New Left, the Klan, and FBI counterintelligence.'' Berkeley: Univ. of California.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some states, "repression" can be an official term used in legislation or the names of government institutions. For example, the [[Soviet Union]] had a legal policy of repression of political opposition defined in [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)|the penal code]] and  [[Cuba]] under [[Fulgencio Batista]] had a [[secret police]] agency officially named the "[[Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities]]."
