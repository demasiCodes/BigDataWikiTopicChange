'''#YesAllWomen''' is a [[Twitter]] [[hashtag]] and [[social media]] campaign in which users share examples or stories of [[misogyny]] and [[violence against women]].&lt;ref name="Nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |last=Medina| first=Jennifer | title = Campus Killings Set Off Anguished Conversation About the Treatment of Women | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate =28 May 2014 | date =27 May 2014 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/27/us/campus-killings-set-off-anguished-conversation-about-the-treatment-of-women.html?ref=us&amp;_r=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First used in online conversations about misogyny following the [[2014 Isla Vista killings]], the hashtag was popular in May 2014, and was created partly in response to the Twitter hashtag [[NotAllMen|#NotAllMen]]. #YesAllWomen reflected a [[grassroots]] campaign in which women shared their personal stories about [[harassment]] and discrimination.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|last=Grinberg|first=Emanuella|title=Why #YesAllWomen took off on Twitter|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/27/living/california-killer-hashtag-yesallwomen/|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign attempted to raise awareness of [[sexism]] that women experience, often from people they know.&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pearce|first=Matt|title=#YesAllWomen: Isla Vista attack puts a spotlight on gender violence|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-isla-vista-women-20140525-story.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Jolie|title=#YesAllWomen: Killing spree sparks furor about misogyny|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/05/27/yesallwomen-elliott-rodger-santa-barbara/9618837/|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TechCrunch"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shu|first=Catherine|title=#YesAllWomen Shows That Misogyny Is Everyone’s Problem|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/26/yesallwomen-shows-that-misogyny-is-everyones-problem/|work=[[TechCrunch]]|accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a killing spree in [[Isla Vista, California]] that left six people dead and fourteen others wounded, the killer's Internet activity was described as misogynistic, and hatred of women was cited as a factor in his crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Killer's Manifesto Reveals Wide Reach Of Misogyny Online|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/05/27/316452303/a-killers-manifesto-reveals-wide-reach-of-misogyny-online|accessdate=18 July 2014|publisher=NPR|date=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carmon|first1=Irin|title=Elliot Rodger’s war on women|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/elliot-rodger-war-women-yesallwomen-hashtag|accessdate=18 July 2014|publisher=MSNBC|date=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dvorak|first1=Petula|title=#YesAllWomen: Elliot Rodger’s misogynistic ravings inspire a powerful response on Twitter|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/yesallwomen-elliott-rodgers-misogynistic-ravings-inspire-a-powerful-response-on-twitter/2014/05/26/dd755e4e-e4e0-11e3-8f90-73e071f3d637_story.html|accessdate=18 July 2014|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buxton|first1=Ryan|title=Elliot Rodger's Misogynist Manifesto Is 'Familiar' To All Women, Professor Says|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/29/elliot-rodger-misogynist-manifesto_n_5412958.html|accessdate=18 July 2014|work=Huffington Post|date=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the wake of the killings, some Twitter users made the argument that "not all men" are like this, or would commit such crimes.&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt;&lt;ref name="92b98ed1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/05/27/not_all_men_how_discussing_women_s_issues_gets_derailed.html|title = Not all men: How discussing women's issues gets derailed|last = Plait|first = Phil|date = 27 May 2014|work = Slate|accessdate = 12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/05/26/yesallwomen_hashtag_sparks_revelations_anger_debate_in_wake_of_california_killing_spree.html|title = #YesAllWomen hashtag sparks revelations, anger, debate in wake of California killing spree|last = Dempsey|first = Amy|date = 26 May 2014|work = Toronto Star|accessdate = 12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others responded by satirizing those arguments and deeming them defensive and an attempt to deflect from uncomfortable topics such as violence and sexism.&lt;ref name="92b98ed1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.springfieldnewssun.com/news/news/whats-yesallwomen-and-notallmen-hashtags/nf7LF/|title = What's up with the #YesAllWomen and #NotAllMen hashtags?|last = Bailey|first = Jasmine|date = 25 May 2014|work = Springfield Sun-Times|accessdate = 12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2014/05/the-power-of-yesallwomen.html|title = The Power Of #YesAllWomen|last = Weiss|first = Sasha|date = 26 May 2014|work =The New Yorker|accessdate = 6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In reaction to the hashtag "#NotAllMen," an anonymous female Twitter user then created "#YesAllWomen" to express that all women are affected by sexism and misogyny, even though not all men are sexist. Some sources have reported that the hashtag creator appears to be twitter user @gildedspine, which was confirmed when The Toast published a reflection piece by her on the hashtag's anniversary in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://the-toast.net/2015/05/26/yesallwomen-one-year-later/|title=On #YesAllWomen, One Year Later|last=M|first=Kaye|date=26 May 2015|website=The Toast|access-date=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/online/why-everyone-should-read-yesallwomen-on-twitter-after-elliot-rodgers-rampage-in-santa-barbara/story-fnjwnhzf-1226931100044|title=Why everyone should read #YesAllWomen on Twitter after Elliot Rodger’s rampage in Santa Barbara|work=NewsComAu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hlntv.com/article/2014/05/25/yesallwomen-elliot-rodger-shooting|title=More than a hashtag: #YesAllWomen|work=HLNtv.com|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hashtag quickly became used by women throughout social media to share their experiences of sexism and harassment.&lt;ref name="92b98ed1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Zimmerman, Jess |url=http://time.com/79357/not-all-men-a-brief-history-of-every-dudes-favorite-argument/ |title=Not All Men Meme Rise of Defense Against Sexism Misogyny |work=TIME |date=28 April 2014|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bridges, Jeff |url=http://time.com/2809276/notallmen-dont-get-it/ |title=#NotAllMen Don’t Get It |work=TIME |date=2 June 2014|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/your-guide-to-not-all-men-the-best-meme-on-the-interne-1573535818|title=Your Guide to 'Not All Men,' the Best Meme on the Internet|work=Jezebel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vendituoli |first=Monica |url=http://chronicle.com/article/NotAllMen-but-YesAllWomen-/146811/ |title=#NotAllMen, but #YesAllWomen: Campus Tragedy Spurs Debate on Sexual Violence - Students - The Chronicle of Higher Education |publisher=Chronicle.com |date=28 May 2014 |accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://mashable.com/2014/05/26/yesallwomen-hashtag/|title = How the #YesAllWomen Hashtag Began|last = Pachal|first = Pete|date = 26 May 2014|work = [[Mashable]]|accessdate = 6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="valenti"&gt;{{cite web|last=Valenti|first=Jessica|title=#YesAllWomen reveals the constant barrage of sexism that women face|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/28/yesallwomen-barage-sexism-elliot-rodger|work=The Guardian|accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=#YesAllWomen Puts Spotlight On Misogyny|publisher=NPR|date=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some tweets included "'I have a boyfriend' is the easiest way to get a man to leave you alone.

== Reach and impact ==
Within four days of the first use of #YesAllWomen, the hashtag had been tweeted 1.2 million times, surpassing predecessors that also drew  attention to violence and sexism toward women.&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; Four days after its first use, ''[[The Guardian]]'' commentator [[Jessica Valenti]] wrote that the YesAllWomen hashtag helped illustrate the prevalence of everyday sexism against women.&lt;ref name="valenti"/&gt; [[Rebecca Solnit]] described it as a watershed moment "in which you could see change happen" and credited it for popularizing the concept of "sexual entitlement", which she characterized as male fury at women for not having met their emotional or sexual needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/06/yesallwomen-shape-conversation-isla-vista-massacre-violence-against-women|title = Why #Yesallwomen Matters|last = Solnit|first = Rebecca|date = 3 June 2014|work = [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|accessdate = 6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', Solnit stated that the hashtag helped change the way that society talks about rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2014/5/27/yesallwomen_rebecca_solnit_on_the_santa|title=#YesAllWomen: Rebecca Solnit on the Santa Barbara Massacre &amp; Viral Response to Misogynist Violence|work=[[Democracy Now!]]|date=27 May 2014|accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cynthia Calkins Mercado, an associate professor of psychology, told ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' that the hashtag changed her mind about the prevalence of misogyny in American society, and has raised awareness of women's experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article438881/After-California-killings-Twitter%E2%80%99s-YesAllWomen-reveals-the-vast-extent-of-misogyny.html|title=After California killings, Twitter’s #YesAllWomen reveals the vast extent of misogyny|last1=Adler|first1=Eric|last2=Williams|first2=Mara Rose|last3=Klein|first3=Kaitlyn|work=[[The Kansas City Star]]|date=3 June 2014|accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Sasha Weiss called the campaign "a kind of memorial, a stern demand for a more just society", and praised Twitter as a powerful vehicle for activism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Cartoon controversy ===
On June 1, 2014, cartoonists [[Michael Kupperman]] and [[David Rees (cartoonist)|David Rees]] were scheduled to release a [[political cartoon]] entitled "Testosterone Entitlement Theatre Presents: The Man-Babies in 'Hashtag Harassment!'" for ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Sunday installment's "See Something, Say Something" that satirized the [[Men's rights movement]]'s response to the hashtag. However, the newspaper believed that "the subject matter (male rage, online bullying &amp; the hashtag #yesallwomen) was 'too sensitive'"&lt;ref name="Kupperman"&gt;{{cite news | title = The Comic Not Fit to Print | last=Kupperman | first=Michael | authorlink=Michael Kupperman | work = [[Squarespace]] | accessdate = June 1, 2014 | date = June 6, 2014 | url =https://michael-kupperman.squarespace.com/kuppermanblahblahblah/2014/6/1/the-comic-not-fit-to-print}}&lt;/ref&gt; to publish and refused to print it. In response to the editorial decision, both Kupperman and Rees uploaded the comic strip independently. That weekend, ''The New York Times'' published a different comic by [[Brian McFadden (cartoonist)|Brian McFadden]] that tackled similar issues.&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite web|last=McDonough|first=Katie|title=This is the #YesAllWomen comic the New York Times wouldn’t publish|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/06/03/this_is_the_yesallwomen_comic_the_new_york_times_wouldnt_publish/|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
Samantha Levine, a columnist at ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', wrote that conflating dress code restrictions and men whistling at women with the Isla Vista killings risks women who have been victims of violence not being taken seriously when they use the hashtag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Not All Sexism is Equal | first=Samantha | last=Levine | work = [[The Daily Beast]] | accessdate =28 May 2014 | date =27 May 2014 | url =http://www.thedailybeast.com/witw/articles/2014/05/27/the-wrong-cultural-debate.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emily Shire criticized some #YesAllWomen tweets as trivial in the context of the Isla Vista killings, citing examples such as "I've never seen a hot husband with a fat wife on a sitcom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = #YesAllWomen Has Jumped the Shark | first=Emily | last=Shire | work = [[The Daily Beast]] | accessdate =28 May 2014 | date =27 May 2014 | url =http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/05/27/how-yesallwomen-became-trivial-a-noble-hashtag-loses-its-bearings.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
