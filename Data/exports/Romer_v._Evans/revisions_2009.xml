'''''Romer v. Evans''''', [[judicial citation|517 U.S. 620]] ([[1996]]), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case dealing with civil rights and state laws. The Court gave its ruling on [[May 20]], [[1996]] against an amendment to the [[Colorado]] state constitution that would have prevented any city, town or county in the state from taking any legislative, executive, or judicial action from recognizing [[homosexual]] citizens as a [[Protected class]].

==The U.S. Supreme Court ruling==
The case was argued on October 10, 1995. On May 20, 1996, the court ruled 6-3 that Colorado's Amendment 2 was unconstitutional, though on different reasoning than the Colorado courts. Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] wrote the majority opinion, and was joined by [[John Paul Stevens]], [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], [[David Souter]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], and [[Stephen Breyer]].

Rejecting the state's argument that Amendment 2 merely blocked gay people from receiving "special rights", Kennedy wrote:

:''To the contrary, the amendment imposes a special disability upon those persons alone. Homosexuals are forbidden the safeguards that others enjoy or may seek without constraint.''

Kennedy argued that protection offered by antidiscrimination laws was not a "special right" because they protected fundamental rights already enjoyed by all other citizens. Though antidiscrimination laws "enumerated" certain groups which they protected, this merely served to put others on notice (i.e., the enumeration was merely declaratory).

Instead of applying "strict scrutiny" to Amendment 2 (as Colorado Supreme Court had required) Kennedy wrote that it did not even meet the much lower requirement of having a rational relationship to a legitimate government purpose:

:''Its sheer breadth is so discontinuous with the reasons offered for it that the amendment seems inexplicable by anything but animus toward the class that it affects; it lacks a rational relationship to legitimate state interests.''

And:

:''[Amendment 2] is at once too narrow and too broad. It identifies persons by a single trait and then denies them protection across the board. The resulting disqualification of a class of persons from the right to seek specific protection from the law is unprecedented in our jurisprudence.''

Kennedy did not go into depth in rejecting the claims put forward in support of the law (protecting the rights of landlords to evict gay tenants if they found homosexuality morally offensive,  etc.) because he held that the law was so unique as to "confound this normal process of judicial review" and "defies...conventional inquiry." This conclusion was supported by his assertion that "It is not within our constitutional tradition to enact laws of this sort." Finding that "laws of the kind now before us raise the inevitable inference that the disadvantage imposed is born of animosity toward the class of persons affected," the Court implied that the passage of Amendment 2 was born of a "bare...desire to harm" homosexuals.

==Dissent==
Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] wrote a dissent which was joined by Chief Justice [[William H. Rehnquist]] and Justice [[Clarence Thomas]]. Scalia wrote:

:''[Amendment 2 is] a modest attempt by seemingly tolerant Coloradans to preserve traditional sexual mores against the efforts of a politically powerful minority to revise those mores through use of the laws. That objective, and the means chosen to achieve it, are [...] unimpeachable under any constitutional doctrine hitherto pronounced.''

Scalia argued that Amendment 2 did not deny homosexuals access to the political process but merely made it more difficult to enact laws that they favored. He noted that the majority's result stood in flat contradiction to the court's earlier decision in ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'', [[legal citation|478 U.S. 186]] ([[1986]]), in which it had ruled that laws outlawing [[sodomy]] are not unconstitutional. That was based on the fact that Bowers had rejected a rational-basis challenge to sodomy laws on the grounds that traditional moral disapproval furnished such a rational basis. Scalia noted:

:''If it is rational to criminalize the conduct, surely it is rational to deny special favor and protection to those with a self-avowed tendency or desire to engage in the conduct.''

Justice Scalia also asked how the holding of the majority could be reconciled with [[Davis v. Beason]], {{ussc|133|333|1890}}:
:"remains to be explained how §501 of the Idaho Revised Statutes was not an "impermissible targeting" of polygamists, but (the much more mild) Amendment 2 is an "impermissible targeting" of homosexuals. Has the Court concluded that the perceived social harm of polygamy is a "legitimate concern of government," and the perceived social harm of homosexuality is not?"

Against what he saw as [[judicial activism]], he wrote:

:''Since the Constitution of the United States says nothing about this subject [homosexuality], it is left to be resolved by normal democratic means, including the democratic adoption of provisions in state constitutions.''

Justice Scalia stated that the Court should take no part in what is termed the "culture war". After quoting a passage from [[Murphy v. Ramsey]], {{ussc|114|15|[[1885]]}} which had praised governmental favouring of heterosexual monogamy, Justice Scalia wrote the following:
:"I would not myself indulge in such official praise for heterosexual monogamy, because I think it no business of the courts (as opposed to the political branches) to take sides in this culture war. But the Court today has done so, not only by inventing a novel and extravagant constitutional doctrine to take the victory away from traditional forces, but even by verbally disparaging as bigotry adherence to traditional attitudes."

The dissent ends as follows:
:"Today's opinion has no foundation in American constitutional law, and barely pretends to. The people of Colorado have adopted an entirely reasonable provision which does not even disfavor homosexuals in any substantive sense, but merely denies them preferential treatment. Amendment 2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration of the sexual morality favored by a majority of Coloradans, and is not only an appropriate means to that legitimate end, but a means that Americans have employed before. Striking it down is an act, not of judicial judgment, but of political will. I dissent."

==Notes==
In 1993, [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] passed Ballot Issue 3, an amendment to the city charter which forbade the city from adopting or enforcing civil rights ordinances based on sexual orientation, the only municipality in the United States to pass such a restriction. The wording of Cincinnati's amendment was almost identical to that of Colorado's. The amendment was upheld by the [[Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals]] in 1996 but remanded by the Supreme Court for further consideration in 1997 in the wake of the ''Romer'' decision. The Sixth Circuit upheld the amendment a second time, differentiating it from the state-level amendment on the grounds that it was a local government action of the type that Amendment 2 was designed to pre-empt. On October 13, 1998, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal, allowing the Sixth Circuit decision and the city amendment to stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Julie | last=Irwin | title=Law denying gay protection stands | date=[[1998]]-[[October 14|10-14]] | url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/1998/10/14/loc_gayrights14.html | work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]] | accessdate=[[2009]]-[[January 3|01-03]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Cincinnati voters overturned the amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Cincinnati gay rights amendment passes | date=[[2006]]-[[March 15|03-15]] | url=http://cincinnati.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2006/03/13/daily40.html | work=[[American City Business Journals|Business Courier of Cincinnati]] | accessdate=[[2009]]-[[January 3|01-03]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ''Romer'' stood in obvious tension with the Court's earlier decision in ''Bowers v. Hardwick'', {{ussc|478|186|1986}}, it laid the groundwork for 2003's ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', {{ussc|539|558|2003}}, which overturned ''Bowers''. ''Romer'', however, has not been widely cited beyond ''Lawrence'', no doubt because Kennedy emphasized the "special" nature of Amendment 2 and refused to apply traditional rational-basis analysis to the Colorado law. 

In this case, the court lined up in almost the same way as in ''Lawrence'', though in ''Lawrence'' Justice O'Connor concurred in the judgment on different grounds.

Ironically, although [[Roy Romer]] was on record as opposing Amendment 2, his name was on the suit as defendant and the appellant solely due to his position as governor of Colorado.

In 2007, fifteen years after the referendum on Amendment 2, a law was passed that banned discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity for all employers in Colorado.
