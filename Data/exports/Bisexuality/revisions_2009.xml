{{Sexual orientation}}
'''Bisexuality''' is sexual behavior with&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4056387?ordinalpos=1&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&amp;linkpos=3&amp;log$=relatedarticles&amp;logdbfrom=pubmed A study of the married bisexual male: paradox and resolution]&lt;/ref&gt; or physical attraction to both sexes ([[male]] and [[female]]), or a bisexual orientation. People who have a bisexual orientation "can experience [[sexual attraction|sexual]], emotional, and affectional attraction to both their own sex and the opposite sex"; "it also refers to an individual’s sense of personal and social identity based on those attractions, behaviors expressing them, and membership in a community of others who share them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apahelpcenter.org/articles/article.php?id=31 APA Help Center]&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the three main classifications of [[sexual orientation]], along with a [[heterosexual]] and a [[homosexual orientation]]. Individuals who do not experience sexual attraction to either sex are known as [[asexual]].

Bisexuality has been observed in various human societies&lt;ref name="Homosexuality and Civilization"&gt;{{cite book |last=Crompton |first=Louis |authorlink=Louis Crompton |title=Homosexuality and Civilization |publisher=[[Belknap Press]] |year=2003 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=067401197X }}&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere in the animal kingdom&lt;ref name="Biological Exuberance"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bagemihl |first=Bruce |authorlink=Bruce Bagemihl |title=Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity |publisher=Profile Books, Ltd. |year=1999 |location=London |isbn=1861971826 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Evolution's Rainbow"&gt;{{cite book |last=Roughgarden |first=Joan |authorlink=Joan Roughgarden |title=Evolution's Rainbow: Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |month=May |year=2004 |location=Berkeley, CA |isbn=0520240731 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bi Species"&gt;{{cite news |last=Driscoll |first=Emily V. |title=Bisexual Species: Unorthodox Sex in the Animal Kingdom |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |date=July 2008 |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=bisexual-species }}&lt;/ref&gt; throughout recorded history. The term ''bisexuality'', however, like the terms ''hetero-'' and ''homosexuality'', was coined in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Bisexuality etymonline.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bisexuality |title=Bisexuality |accessdate=16 February 2007 |author=Harper, Douglas |year=2001 |month=11 |work=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Despite misconceptions, bisexuality does not require that a person be attracted ''equally'' to both sexes. In fact, people who have a distinct but not exclusive preference for one sex over the other may still identify themselves as bisexual. A 2005 study by researchers Gerulf Rieger, Meredith L. Chivers, and [[J. Michael Bailey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rieger G, Chivers ML, Bailey JM |title=Sexual arousal patterns of bisexual men |journal=Psychological science : a journal of the American Psychological Society / APS |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=579–84 |year=2005 |pmid=16102058 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01578.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; which attracted media attention, purported to find that bisexuality is extremely rare in men. This was based on results of controversial [[penile plethysmograph]] testing when viewing pornographic material involving only men and pornography involving only women. Critics state that this study works from the assumption that a person is only truly bisexual if he or she exhibits virtually equal arousal responses to both opposite-sex and same-sex stimuli, and have consequently dismissed the self-identification of people whose arousal patterns showed even a mild preference for one sex. Some researchers say that the technique used in the study to measure genital arousal is too crude to capture the richness (erotic sensations, affection, admiration) that constitutes sexual attraction.&lt;ref name="Carey"&gt;{{cite news |last=Carey |first=Benedict |title=Straight, Gay or Lying?

In 1995, Harvard Shakespeare professor [[Marjorie Garber]] made the academic case for bisexuality with her 600 page, ''Vice Versa: Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life'' in which she argued that most people would be bisexual if not for "repression, religion, repugnance, denial" and "premature specialization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Garber, Marjorie B. |authorlink=Marjorie Garber |title=Vice versa: bisexuality and the eroticism of everyday life |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=0684803089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual orientation, identity, behavior==
{{Main|Sexual orientation|Sexual orientation identity|Sexual behavior}}
{{See also|Situational sexual behavior}}
[[American Psychological Association]] states that sexual orientation "describes the pattern of sexual attraction, behavior and identity e.g. [[homosexual]] (aka [[gay]], [[lesbian]]), bisexual and heterosexual (aka straight)." "Sexual attraction, behavior and identity may be incongruent. For example, sexual attraction and/or behavior may not necessarily be consistent with identity. Some individuals may identify themselves as homosexual or bisexual without having had any sexual experience. Others have had homosexual experiences but do not consider themselves to be gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Further, sexual orientation falls along a continuum. In other words, someone does not have to be exclusively homosexual or heterosexual, but can feel varying degrees of both. Sexual orientation develops across a person's lifetime-different people realize at different points in their lives that they are heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual."&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.aapa.org/clinissues/2007C03.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rosario, Schrimshaw, Hunter, Braun (2006), "the development of a lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) sexual identity is a complex and often difficult process. Unlike members of other minority groups (e.g., ethnic and racial minorities), most LGB individuals are not raised in a community of similar others from whom they leam about their identity and who reinforce and support that identity. Rather, LGB individuals are often raised in communities that are either ignorant of or openly hostile toward homosexuality." &lt;ref name="Rosario et al."&gt;Rosario, M., Schrimshaw, E., Hunter, J., &amp; Braun, L. (2006, February). Sexual identity development among lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths: Consistency and change over time. Journal of Sex Research, 43(1), 46-58. Retrieved April 4, 2009, from PsycINFO database.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[longitudinal study]] about sexual identity development among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youths, its authors "found evidence of both considerable consistency and
change in LGB sexual identity over time." Youths who had identified as both gay/lesbian and bisexual prior to baseline were approximately three times more likely to identify as gay/lesbian than as bisexual at subsequent assessments. Of youths who had identified only as bisexual at earlier assessments, 60-70% continued to identify as bisexual, while approximately 30-40% assumed a gay/lesbian identity over time. Authors suggested that "although there were youths who consistently self-identified as bisexual throughout the study, for other youths, a bisexual identity served as a transitional identity to a subsequent gay/lesbian identity."&lt;ref name="Rosario et al."/&gt;

Bisexuals commonly start to identify as bisexuals in their early to mid twenties.&lt;ref name="Fox."&gt;Fox, Ronald C. (1995). Bisexual identities.  In A. R. D'Augelli &amp; C.J.

==Prevalence==
{{Main|Demographics of sexual orientation|Kinsey Reports}}

A 2002 survey in the United States by [[National Center for Health Statistics]] found that 1.8 percent of men ages 18–44 considered themselves bisexual, 2.3 percent homosexual, and 3.9 percent as "something else". The same study found that 2.8 percent of women ages 18–44 considered themselves bisexual, 1.3 percent homosexual, and 3.8 percent as "something else".&lt;ref name="Kinsey FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/resources/FAQ.html |title=Frequently Asked Sexuality Questions to the Kinsey Institute |accessdate=16 February 2007 |publisher=The Kinsey Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Janus Report on Sexual Behavior'', published in 1993, showed that 5 percent of men and 3 percent of women consider themselves bisexual and 4 percent of men and 2 percent of women considered themselves homosexual.&lt;ref name="Kinsey FAQ" /&gt; The 'Health' section of ''The New York Times'' has stated that "1.5 percent of American women identify themselves [as] bisexual."&lt;ref name="Carey"/&gt;

[[Alfred Kinsey|Dr. Alfred Kinsey's]] 1948 work ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]'' found that "46% of the male population had engaged in both heterosexual and homosexual activities, or 'reacted to' persons of both sexes, in the course of their adult lives".&lt;ref name="institute"&gt;[http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/research/ak-data.html Research Summary] from the [http://www.kinseyinstitute.org Kinsey Institute].&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsey himself disliked the use of the term bisexual to describe individuals who engage in sexual activity with both males and females, preferring to use "bisexual" in its original, biological sense as hermaphoditic: "Until it is demonstrated [that] taste in a sexual relation is dependent upon the individual containing within his anatomy both male and female structures, or male and female physiological capacities, it is unfortunate to call such individuals bisexual" (Kinsey et al., 1948, p.&amp;nbsp;657).&lt;ref&gt;Kinsey, A. C., Pomeroy, W. B., &amp; Martin, C. E. (1948). ''Sexual behavior in the human male.'' Philadelphia and London: W. B. Saunders.&lt;/ref&gt;
Dr. [[Fritz Klein]] believed that social and emotional attraction are very important elements in bisexual attraction. One third of the men in each group showed no significant arousal. The study did not claim them to be asexual, and Rieger stated that their lack of response did not change the overall findings.

[[Sigmund Freud]] theorized that every person has the ability to become bisexual at some time in his or her life.&lt;ref name="Carey"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund (translated by A.A. Brill), ''Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex'', Dover Publications, 128 pages, ISBN 0486416038&lt;/ref&gt; He based this on the idea that enjoyable experiences of sexuality with the same sex, whether sought or unsought, acting on it or being fantasized, become an attachment to his or her needs and desires in social upbringing. Prominent psychoanalyst Dr. [[Joseph Merlino (doctor)|Joseph Merlino]], Senior Editor of the book, ''Freud at 150: 21st Century Essays on a Man of Genius'' stated in an interview:

{{cquote2| Freud maintained that bisexuality was a normal part of development. That all of us went through a period of bisexuality and that, in the end, most of us came out heterosexual but that the bisexual phase we traversed remained on some unconscious level, and was dealt with in other ways....He did not consider it something that should be criminalized, or penalized.... Freud felt there were a number of homosexuals he encountered who did not have a variety of complex problems that homosexuality was a part of. He found people who were totally normal in every other regard except in terms of their sexual preference. In fact, he saw many of them as having higher intellects, higher aesthetic sensibilities, higher morals; those kinds of things. He did not see it as something to criminalize or penalize, or to keep from psychoanalytic training. A lot of the psychoanalytic institutes felt if you were homosexual you should not be accepted; that was not Freud's position.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Merlino (doctor)|Joseph Merlino]], [http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Dr._Joseph_Merlino_on_sexuality%2C_insanity%2C_Freud%2C_fetishes_and_apathy#Gender_identity_and_Heteronormativity Interview with Dr. Joseph Merlino], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', October 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Human bisexuality has mainly been studied alongside with homosexuality. Van Wyk &amp; Geist (1995) argue that this is a problem for sexuality research because the few studies that have observed bisexuals separately have found that bisexuals are often different from both heterosexuals and homosexuals. Furthermore, bisexuality does not always represent a halfway between the dichotomy. Research indicates that bisexuality is influenced by biological, cognitive and cultural variables in interaction, and this leads to different types of bisexuality.&lt;ref name=VanWyk&gt;{{cite journal |author=Van Wyk PH,Geist CS|title=Biology of Bisexuality: Critique and Observations |journal=Journal of Homosexuality |volume=28 |issue=3-4 |pages=357–373 |year=1995 |10.1300/J082v28n03_11 |doi=10.1300/J082v28n03_11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is currently a debate on the importance of biological influences on sexual orientation. Biological explanations have been put to question by social scientists, particularly by feminists who encourage women to make conscious decisions about their life and sexuality. A difference in attitude between homosexual men and women has also been reported as men are more likely to regard their sexuality as biological, "reflecting the universal male experience in this culture, not the complexities of the lesbian world." There is also evidence that women's sexuality may be more strongly affected by cultural and contextual factors.&lt;ref name=Veniegas&gt;{{cite journal

Most of the few available scientific studies on bisexuality date from before the 1990s. Interest in bisexuality has generally grown, but research focus has lately been on sociology and gender studies as well as on bisexuals with HIV and AIDS.

===Social factors===
There is a consensus among scholars{{Which?|date=October 2009}} of different faculties{{Which?|date=October 2009}} that cultural and social factors have an effect on human sexual behaviour{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}. As bisexual people come from all social classes, social status within the individuals environment, and familial backgrounds, such factors cannot independently explain why some people are bisexual{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.

Krafft-Ebing was the first to suggest that bisexuality is the original state of human sexuality{{Verify source|date=October 2009}}. Freud has famously summarized on the basis of clinical observations: ''"[W]e have come to know that all human beings are bisexual - - and that their libido is distributed between objects of both sexes, either in a manifest or a latent form."'' According to Freud, people remain bisexual all their lives in a repression to monosexuality of fantasy and behaviour. This idea was  taken up in the 1940s by the zoologist Alfred Kinsey who was the first to create a scale to measure the continuum of sexual orientation from hetero to homosexuality. Kinsey studied human sexuality and argued that people have the capability of being hetero or homosexual even if this trait does not present itself in the current circumstances.&lt;ref name=Young-Bruehl&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

From an anthropological perspective, there is large variation in the prevalence of bisexuality between different cultures. Among some tribes it appears to be non-existent while in others a universal, including the Sambia of New Guinea and other similar Melanesian cultures.&lt;ref name=VanWyk /&gt;

Even though only a small percentage of people have bisexual traits, this does not outrule the possibility of bisexual behaviour of the majority in different circumstances. Similarly, although evolutionary psychologists consider most males as promiscuous by nature, the majority of American men are faithful to their wives, appearing essentially monogamous. These traits can be explained as the result of culture constraints on evolutionary predispositions.&lt;ref name=Muscarella&gt;{{cite journal |last=Muscarella |first=Frank |coauthors=Bernhard Fink, karl Grammer, Michael Kirk-Smith |title=Homosexual Orientation in Males: Evolutionary and Ethological Aspects |journal=Neuroendocrinology Letters |volume=22 |pages=393–400 |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex drive===
Several studies comparing bisexuals with hetero- or homosexuals have indicated that bisexuals have higher rates of sexual activity, fantasy or erotic interest. Van Wyk and Geist (1984) found that male and female bisexuals had more sexual fantasy than heterosexuals. Dixon (1985) found that bisexual men had more sexual activities with women than did heterosexual men. Bisexual men masturbated more but had less happy marriages than heterosexuals. Bressler and Lavender (1986) found that bisexual women had more orgasms per week and they described them as stronger than did hetero- or homosexual women. Also found, marriages with a bisexual female were more happy than heterosexual unions, observed less instance of hidden infidelity, and ended in divorce less frequently. Goode and Haber (1977) found bisexual women to be sexually mature earlier, masturbate and enjoy masturbation more and to be more experienced in different types of heterosexual contact.&lt;ref name=VanWyk /&gt;

Recent research suggests that, for most women, high sex drive is associated with increased sexual attraction to both women and men. For men, however, high sex drive is associated with increased attraction to one sex or the other, but not to both, depending on sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Lippa, R. A., 2006. ''Psychological Science," 17, 46-52&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent research, however, associates high sex drive and increased attraction to both sexes only in women. Bisexual men's pattern has been more similar to heterosexuals with a stronger correlation with high sex drive and other-sex attraction.&lt;ref name=Muscarella&gt;{{cite journal

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Masculinization===
Masculinization of women and hypermasculinization of men has been a central theme in sexual orientation research. There are several studies suggesting that bisexuals have a high degree of masculinization. LaTorre and Wendenberg (1983) found differing personality characteristics for bisexual, heterosexual and homosexual women. Bisexuals were found to have less personal insecurities than heterosexuals and homosexuals. This finding defined bisexuals as self assured and less likely to suffer from mental instabilities. The confidence of a secure identity consistently translated to more masculinity than other subjects. This study did not explore societal norms, prejudices, or the feminization of homosexual males.&lt;ref name=VanWyk /&gt;

In a research comparison, published in the Journal of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology, women usually have a better hearing sensitivity than males, assumed by researchers as a genetic disposition connected to child rearing. Homosexual and bisexual women have been found to have a hypersensitivity to sound in comaparison to heterosexual women, suggesting a genetic disposition to not tolerant high pitched tones. While heterosexual, homosexual and bisexual men have been found to exhibit similar patterns of hearing. There was a notable differential within a sub-group of males identified as hyperfeminized homosexual males who exhibited test results similar to heterosexual women. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prenatal hormones====
The prenatal hormonal theory of sexual orientation suggests that people who are exposed to excess levels of sex hormones have masculinized brains and show increased homosexuality. Studies to provide evidence for the masculinization of the brain have however not been conducted to date. Research on special conditions such as [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia|CAH]] and [[DES]] indicate that prenatal exposure to, respectively, excess testosterone and estrogens are associated with female–female sex fantasies in adults. Both effects are associated with bisexuality rather than homosexuality.&lt;ref name=Veniegas /&gt;

There is research evidence that the [[Digit ratio|ratio]] of the length of the 2nd and 4th digits (index finger and ring finger) is somewhat negatively related to prenatal testosterone and positively to estrogen. Studies measuring the fingers found a statistically significant skew in the 2D:4D ratio (long ring finger) towards homosexuality with an even lower ratio in bisexuals. It is suggested that exposure to high prenatal testosterone and low prenatal estrogen concentrations is one cause of homosexuality whereas exposure to very high testosterone levels may be associated with bisexuality. Because testosterone in general is important for sexual differentiation, this view offers an alternative to the suggestion that male homosexuality is genetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Robinson, SJ &amp; Manning, TJ|title=The ratio of 2nd to 4th digit length and male homosexuality |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=21 |pages=333–345 |year=2000 |pii=PII: S1090-5138(00)00052-0 |doi=10.1016/S1090-5138(00)00052-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prenatal hormonal theory suggests that a homosexual orientation results from exposure to excessive testosterone causing an over-masculinized brain. This is contradictory to another hypothesis that homosexual preferences may be due to a feminized brain in males. However, it has also been suggested that homosexuality may be due to high prenatal levels of unbound testosterone that results from a lack of receptors at particular brain sites. Therefore the brain could be feminized while other features, such as the 2D:4D ratio could be over-masculinized.&lt;ref name=Muscarella /&gt;

====Brain structure====
LaVey's (1991) examination at autopsy of 18 homosexual men, 1 bisexual man, 16 presumably heterosexual men and 6 presumably heterosexual women found that the [[INAH 3]] nucleus of the [[anterior hypothalamus]] of homosexual men was smaller than that of heterosexual men and the size of heterosexual women. Although grouped with homosexuals, the INAH 3 size of the one bisexual subject was similar to that of the heterosexual men.&lt;ref name=VanWyk /&gt;

====Chromosomes====
There is some evidence to support the concept of biological precursors of bisexual orientation in genetic males. According to Money (1988), men with an extra Y chromosome are more likely to be bisexual, paraphilic and impulsive.&lt;ref name=VanWyk /&gt;

===Evolutionary theory===
Some evolutionary psychologists have argued that same-sex attraction does not have adaptive value because it has no association with potential reproductive success. Instead, bisexuality can be due to normal variation in brain plasticity. More recently, it has been suggested that same-sex alliances may have helped males climb the social hierarchy giving access to females and reproductive opportunities. Same-sex allies could have helped females to move to the safer and resource richer center of the group, which increased their chances of raising their offspring successfully.&lt;ref name=Muscarella /&gt;

Brendan Zietsch of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research proposes the alternative theory that men exhibiting female traits become more attractive to females and are thus more likely to mate, provided the genes involved do not drive them to complete rejection of heterosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12465295 How homosexuality may have evolved]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in a 2008 study, its authors stated that "There is considerable evidence that human sexual orientation is genetically influenced, so it is not known how homosexuality, which tends to lower reproductive success, is maintained in the population at a relatively high frequency." They hypothesized that "while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals' reproductive success, they may confer some advantage in heterosexuals who carry them." and their results suggested that "genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals, which could help explain the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population." &lt;ref&gt;Zietsch, B., Morley, K., Shekar, S., Verweij, K., Keller, M., Macgregor, S., et al. (2008, November). Genetic factors predisposing to homosexuality may increase mating success in heterosexuals. Evolution and Human Behavior, 29(6), 424-433.

==History==
[[Image:Japanesepederasty18thcentury.jpg|left|thumb|250px|&lt;!--PLEASE SEE TALK PAGE SECTION "Wrong caption for the Japanese illo" BEFORE CHANGING THIS CAPTION, THANKS.--&gt;''[[Shudo]]'' (Japanese pederasty): a young male entertains an older male lover, covering his eyes while surreptitiously kissing a female [[servant]].]]

In 124 AD the bisexual Roman emperor [[Hadrian]] met [[Antinous]], a 13- or 14-year-old boy from [[Bithynia]], and they began their pederastic relationship. Antinous was deified by Hadrian when he died six years later. Many statues, busts, coins and reliefs display Hadrian's deep affections for him.

===Ancient Greece===
{{Main|Homosexuality in ancient Greece}}
[[Image:Pederastic erotic scene Louvre F85bis.jpg|thumb|right|Young man and teenager engaging in [[intercrural sex]], fragment of a [[black-figure]] Attic cup, 550 BC–525 BC, [[Louvre]].]]

[[Ancient Greek]] religious texts, reflecting cultural practices, incorporated bisexual themes. The subtexts varied, from the mystical to the didactic.&lt;ref name="Greek homosexuality - livius.org" /&gt;  

Spartans thought that love and erotic relationships between experienced and novice soldiers would solidify combat loyalty and encourage heroic tactics as men vied to impress their lovers. Once the younger soldiers reached maturity, the relationship was supposed to become non-sexual, but it is not clear how strictly this was followed. There was some stigma attached to young men who continued their relationships with their mentors into adulthood.&lt;ref name="Greek homosexuality - livius.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livius.org/ho-hz/homosexuality/homosexuality.html |title=Greek Homosexuality |accessdate=17 February 2007 |last=van Dolen |first=Hein}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[Aristophanes]] calls them ''euryprôktoi'', meaning "wide arses", and depicts them like women.&lt;ref name="Greek homosexuality - livius.org" /&gt;

[[Alexander the Great]], the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] king, is thought to have been bisexual, and to have had a male lover named [[Hephaestion]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==Social status==
{{About|bisexuality in human sexuality|Bisexual/Fluid/Pansexual community(s) in current culture|Bisexual community}}

Because some bisexual people do not feel that they fit into either the [[gay community|homosexual]] or the heterosexual world, and because they have a tendency to be "invisible" in public, some bisexual persons are committed to forming their own [[Bisexual community|communities]], culture, and political movements. Some who identify as bisexual may merge themselves into either homosexual or heterosexual society.  Still other bisexual people see this merging as [[Bisexual erasure|enforced]] rather than voluntary; bisexual people can [[Biphobia|face exclusion]] from both homosexual and heterosexual society on coming out. Psychologist Beth Firestein states that bisexuals also tend to internalize social tensions related to their choice of partners.&lt;ref name="A new generation of issues for LGBT clients"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb02/generation.html |title=A new generation of issues for LGBT clients |accessdate=16 February 2007 |author=DeAngelis, Tori  |year=2002 |month=02 |work=Monitor on Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firestein suggests bisexuals may feel pressured to label themselves as homosexuals instead of occupying a difficult middle ground in a culture that has it that if bisexuals are attracted to people of both sexes, they must have more than one partner, thus defying society's value on monogamy.&lt;ref name="A new generation of issues for LGBT clients" /&gt; These social tensions and pressure may and do affect bisexuals' mental health.&lt;ref name="A new generation of issues for LGBT clients" /&gt; Specific therapy methods have been developed for bisexuals to address this concern.&lt;ref name="A new generation of issues for LGBT clients" /&gt;

Bisexual behaviors are also associated in popular culture with men who engage in [[men who have sex with men|same-sex activity]] while otherwise presenting as heterosexual. The majority of such men—said to be ''living on the [[down-low (MSM)|down-low]]''—do not self-identify as bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keithboykin.com/arch/001311.html |title=10 Things You Should Know About the DL |accessdate=23 February 2007 |author=Boykin, Keith |date=3 February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However this is a cultural misperception and should actually be seen as more closely associated with all [[LGBT]] individuals who due to societal pressures hide their actual orientation, a phenomena colloquially called ''"being [[closeted]]"''. 

==Pride symbols==
{{Main|LGBT symbols}}
[[Image:Bi flag.svg|thumb|right|The bisexual pride flag|120px]]
A common symbol of the Bisexual community is the [[bisexual pride flag]], which has a deep pink stripe at the top for homosexuality, a blue one on the bottom for heterosexuality, and a purple one, blended from the pink and blue, in the middle to represent bisexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biflag.com/Activism.asp |title=Bi Pride Flag |accessdate=16 February 2007 |author=Page, Michael |quote=The pink color represents sexual attraction to the same sex only, homosexuality, the blue represents sexual attraction to the opposite sex only, heterosexuality, and the resultant overlap color purple represents sexual attraction to both sexes (bi).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:bi triangles.svg|thumb|left|The overlapping triangles|120px]]

Another symbol that uses the color scheme of the bisexual pride flag is a pair of overlapping pink and blue triangles, the pink triangle being a well-known symbol for the homosexual community, forming purple where they intersect.&lt;ref name="lambda symbols"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lambda.org/symbols.htm |title=Symbols of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Movements |accessdate=27 February 2007 |date=26 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bisexual-moon-symbol.svg|thumb|right|Bisexual moon symbol|120px]]

Many homosexual and bisexual individuals have a problem with the use of the [[pink triangle]] symbol as it was the symbol that Hitler's regime used to tag homosexuals (similar to the yellow [[Star of David]] that is constituted of two opposed, overlapping triangles).  Because pink triangles were used in the persecution of homosexuals in the Nazi regime, a double moon symbol was devised specifically to avoid the use of triangles.&lt;ref name="gay symbols 5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://andrejkoymasky.com/lou/sym/sym05.html |title=Gay Symbols: Other Miscellaneous Symbols |accessdate=18 February 2007 |author=Koymasky, Matt |coauthors=Koymasky Andrej |date=14 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The double moon symbol is common in Germany and surrounding countries.&lt;ref name="gay symbols 5" /&gt;
Another symbol used for bisexuality is a purple diamond, conceptually derived from the intersection of an upside down triangle and a right way up one, pink and blue (respectively), placed overlapping.

==Bisexuality in the animal kingdom==
{{Main|Animal sexuality}}
Many non-human animal species also exhibit bisexual behavior.&lt;ref name="Biological Exuberance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Evolution's Rainbow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bi Species"/&gt; Examples of mammals include the [[bonobo]] (formerly known as the pygmy chimpanzee), [[orca]], and [[bottlenose dolphin]].  Examples of avians include some species of gulls and [[Humboldt Penguin]]s.  Other examples occur among fish, flatworms, and crustaceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/bisdia.htm |title=Bisexuality: A Biological Perspective |accessdate=17 February 2007 |author=Diamond, Milton |year=1998 |work=Bisexualities - The Ideology and Practice of Sexual Contact with both Men and Women}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many species of animals are involved in the act of forming sexual and relationship bonds between the same sex; even when offered the opportunity to breed with members of the opposite sex, they picked the same sex. Some of these species are gazelles, antelope, bison, and sage grouse.&lt;ref name=Bidstrup&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bidstrup.com/sodomy.htm |title=The Natural Crime Against Nature |accessdate=26 June 2007 |author=Scott Bidstrup |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases animals will choose intercourse with different sexes at different times in their life, and sometimes will perform intercourse with different sexes at random. Homosexual intercourse can also be seasonal in some animals like male walruses, who often engage in homosexual intercourse with each other outside of the breeding season and will revert to heterosexual intercourse during breeding season.&lt;ref name=Bidstrup/&gt;

In some cases bisexuality is actually a form of fitness favored by evolution.  For example, in the absence of male [[whiptail lizard]]s (Cnemidophorus), females reproduce by pairing up with each other.  During the breeding season females will take turns switching between "male" and "female" roles as their hormones fluctuate.  Estrogen levels are high during ovulation ("female" role) and much lower after laying eggs ("male" role).  While in the "male" role, a female lizard will mount another in the "female" role and go through the motions of sex to stimulate egg-laying.  The hatchlings produced are all female.  This all-female species has evolved from lizards with two sexes, but their eggs develop without fertilization (parthenogenesis).  Female whiptail lizards can lay eggs without sex, but they lay far fewer eggs than if they engage in sexual stimulation by another female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biology |author=Neil A. Campbell, Jane B. Reece |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bisexuality in culture==
{{Refimprovesect|date=May 2008}}
{{Main|Media portrayals of bisexuality}}
;Film
Comparatively positive and notable portrayals of bisexuality can be found throughout mainstream media. In movies such as: ''[[The Pillow Book (film)]]''; ''[[Alexander (film)]]''; ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]''; ''[[Henry and June]]''; ''[[Chasing Amy]]''; ''[[Kissing Jessica Stein]]'', ''[[The Fourth Man]]'', ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' and ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]''. Especially noteworthy are the bisexual themes in the films of [[Federico Fellini]]. While individual films are rarely "bisexual" themselves, he has made films that both employ prominent heterosexual characters and themes ''[[La Strada]]'', ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'',  ''[[8 1/2]]'', and ''[[Amarcord]]'' and also made blatantly homosexual themed films such as ''[[Satyricon]]'' and involving homosexual themes and characters in many of his less famous films. Fellini was suspected of being bisexual in real life, though the extent to which he had many sexual relationships at all, much less of both sexes, is unclear. 

A recent documentary called [http://www.bithewaymovie.com/ "Bi the Way"] aired on the GLBT tv station Logo on August 1, 2009 and again August 3, 2009, and is also available on Logo [http://www.logoonline.com/video/bi-the-way/1616890/playlist.jhtml online].  The movie followed the lives of five young bisexual Americans ages 28 to 11, and talked about bisexuality in general, as well showing scientific studies, interviews with many leaders in the bisexual community, and media portrayals, While some in the bi/pan/fluid community felt the movie stereotyped them, overall it was well received by the community for being a mostly positive portrayal of bi/pan/fluid people, and for bringing their struggles to media attention.

;Music
In [[popular music]], many of the songs of [[The Smiths]] are commonly cited as classic examples. In 1995,  [[Jill Sobule]] sung about bi-curiosity in her song "I Kissed a Girl". The video for the song was slightly less subtle alternating images of Jill Sobule and her boyfriend (played by [[Fabio]]) with images of her with her girlfriend. The recently popular song "[[I Kissed a Girl (Katy Perry song)|I Kissed a Girl]]" by [[Katy Perry]] also hints at bisexuality, or at least bi-curiosity, with lyrics such as "I kissed a girl just to try it/I hope my boyfriend don't mind it" and "You're my experimental game/Just human nature". Some bisexuals find this song offensive however, as it reinforces the stereotype of bisexuals simply experimenting and bisexuality not being a real sexual preference. Another, considered, offensive lyric is "not the way good girls should behave."
;Literature
[[Virginia Woolf]]'s ''[[Orlando: A Biography]]'' (1928) is one of the earliest examples of bisexuality in literature. The story about a man who changes into a woman without a second thought, was based on the life of Woolf's then bisexual lover [[Vita Sackville-West]].  Woolf used the gender switch to avoid the book being banned for homosexual content, and was successful for it. Prior to ''Orlando'', Woolf's ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' (1925) focused on a bisexual man and a bisexual woman in sexually unfulfilled heterosexual marriages in later life. Following Sackille-West's death, her son [[Nigel Nicolson]] would publish ''[[Portrait of a Marriage]]'', one of her diaries recounting her affair with a woman during her marriage to [[Harold Nicolson]]. Other early examples include works of [[D.H. Lawrence]], such as ''[[Women in Love]]'' (1920), and [[Colette]]'s ''[[Claudine à l'école|Claudine]]'' (1900-1903) series. Contemporary novelist [[Bret Easton Ellis]]' novels, such as ''[[Less Than Zero]]'' (1985) and ''[[The Rules of Attraction]]'' (1987) frequently feature bisexual male characters.

'''Webseries'''

As of October 2009, there is a [[bisexual]] "[[webisode]]" series known as "A Rose By Any Other Name" &lt;ref name="Rose"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKZoCaVZu3c|title=Rose By Any Other Name }}&lt;/ref&gt; being released on [[YouTube]] that was directed by Independent film director and [[bisexual]] rights advocate [[Kyle Schickner]] of Fencesitter Films. &lt;ref name="Fencesitter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fencesitterfilms.com|title=Fencesitter Films}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plot of the series centers around a [[lesbian]] identified woman who falls in love with a [[straight]] man, and goes on to realize she is actually [[bisexual]], and the reaction of both her friends and her boyfriend's friends. &lt;ref name="BiNet Kyle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://binetusa.blogspot.com/2009/10/from-out-bi-director-kyle-schickner.html|title=From Out Bi Director Kyle Schickner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media stereotypes===
There tend to be negative media portrayals; references sometimes made to stereotypes or mental disorders.

In an article regarding the 2005 film ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'', sex educator Amy Andre argued that in films, bisexuals are always depicted negatively:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nsrc.sfsu.edu/MagArticle.cfm?Article=554 |title=Opinion: Bisexual Cowboys in Love |accessdate=22 November 2006 |first=Amy |last=Andre |publisher=[[National Sexuality Resource Center]] (NSCR)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|I like movies where bisexuals come out to each other together and fall in love, because these tend to be so few and far between; the most recent example would be 2002's lovely romantic comedy, Kissing Jessica Stein. Most movies with bi characters paint a stereotypical picture: the unlucky, unsuspecting, hetero or gay person falls for the bisexual bon vivant, and all hell breaks loose. The bi love interest is usually deceptive (''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''), over-sexed (''Sex Monster''), unfaithful (''[[High Art]]''), and fickle (''[[Three of Hearts]]''), and might even be a serial killer, like Sharon Stone in ''[[Basic Instinct]]''. In other words, the bisexual is always the cause of the conflict in the film.|Amy Andre|''American Sexuality Magazine''}}

Using a content analysis of more than 170 articles written between 2001 and 2006, [[sociology|sociologist]] Richard N. Pitt, Jr. concluded that the media pathologized black bisexual men’s behavior while either ignoring or sympathizing with white bisexual men’s similar actions.  He argued that the "Down Low" black bisexual is often described negatively as a ''duplicitous heterosexual'' man whose behaviors threaten the black community. Alternately, the [[Brokeback Mountain|"Brokeback"]] white bisexual (when seen as bisexual at all) is often described in pitying language as a ''victimized homosexual'' man who is forced into the closet by the [[heterosexism|heterosexist]] society around him.&lt;ref name="Pitt"&gt;Pitt, Richard N., Jr. (2006) "Downlow Mountain? De/Stigmatizing Bisexuality Through Pitying And Pejorative Discourses In Media". [http://www.mensstudies.com/content/120392/?p=5836e79535e54e3bb24fa8a3d757b32d&amp;pi=2 Journal Of Men's Studies] 14:254-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the HBO drama ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]'', [[Christopher Meloni]] played [[Chris Keller]], a bisexual [[serial killer]] who tortured, raped, and had numerous sexual encounters with various men and women whom he met.

[[Dana Carvey]] as [[The Church Lady]] on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' poked fun at bisexuality as a part of this joke:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A bisexual is a person who reaches down the front of somebody's pants and is satisfied with whatever they find."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Movies in which the bisexual characters conceal murderous neuroses include ''Basic Instinct'', ''[[Black Widow]]'', ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'', ''[[Cruising]]'', and ''[[Girl, Interrupted (film)|Girl, Interrupted]]''.
