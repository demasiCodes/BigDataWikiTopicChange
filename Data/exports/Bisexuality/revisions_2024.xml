{{Sexual orientation}}
'''Bisexuality''' is a [[Romance (love)|romantic]] or [[sexual attraction]] or [[Human sexual activity|behavior]] toward both [[male]]s and [[female]]s,&lt;!-- SOURCING: As discussed on the talk page, there are two definitions of bisexuality, but the one used by authoritative sources and dictionary/other encyclopedic sources only mentions two sexes/two genders (male/female and man/woman), not "all sexes/genders," "more than one gender" or "irrespective of gender." Initially stating "males and females" is following the Wikipedia WP:Due weight policy and keeps things simple without delving into the complex issues of sex and gender, which are broached in the rest of the paragraph (and lower in the article) with the second definition of bisexuality and how that may be termed "pansexuality." --&gt;&lt;ref name="AmPsycholAssn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="healthyminds.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Orientation|publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|archive-date=26 July 2011|access-date=3 December 2012|url=http://healthyminds.org/More-Info-For/GayLesbianBisexuals.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726144306/http://healthyminds.org/More-Info-For/GayLesbianBisexuals.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey" /&gt; to more than one [[gender]],&lt;ref name="APA on bisexuality"&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Bisexuality|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|date=2019|access-date=8 March 2019|url=https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/bisexual|archive-date=8 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190308080859/https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/bisexual|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to both people of the same gender and different genders.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It may also be defined to include romantic or sexual attraction to people regardless of their sex or [[gender identity]], which is also known as ''[[pansexuality]].''&lt;ref name="Carroll"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Carroll JL|title=Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity|isbn=978-1305446038|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2015|page=322|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cy9-BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT322|quote=Pansexuality is also sometimes included under the definition of bisexuality, since pansexuality rejects the gender binary and encompasses romantic or sexual attractions to all gender identities.|access-date=8 March 2019|archive-date=7 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211107233532/https://books.google.com/books?id=cy9-BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT322|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sex and society"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sex and Society|volume=2|page=593|last=Rice|first=Kim|isbn=978-0-7614-7905-5|publisher=[[Marshall Cavendish]]|year=2009|editor=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|contribution=Pansexuality|access-date=3 October 2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YtsxeWE7VD0C&amp;q=Pansexuality&amp;pg=PA593|quote=In some contexts, the term pansexuality is used interchangeably with bisexuality, which refers to attraction to individuals of both sexes...

The bisexual activist [[Robyn Ochs]] defines bisexuality as "the potential to be attracted—romantically and/or sexually—to people of more than one sex and/or gender, not necessarily at the same time, not necessarily in the same way, and not necessarily to the same degree."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eisner|first=Shiri|title=Bi: Notes for a Bi Revolution|year=2013|publisher=Seal Press|isbn=978-1-58005-474-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rosario, Schrimshaw, Hunter, Braun (2006):{{blockquote|...the development of a lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) sexual identity is a complex and often difficult process. Unlike members of other minority groups (e.g., ethnic and racial minorities), most LGB individuals are not raised in a community of similar others from whom they learn about their identity and who reinforce and support that identity. Rather, LGB individuals are often raised in communities that are either ignorant of or openly hostile toward homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Rosario"/&gt;}}

Bisexuality as a transitional identity has also been examined. In a [[longitudinal study]] about sexual identity development among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youths, Rosario et al. "found evidence of both considerable consistency and change in LGB sexual identity over time". Youths who had identified as both gay/lesbian and bisexual prior to baseline were approximately three times more likely to identify as gay/lesbian than as bisexual at subsequent assessments. Of youths who had identified only as bisexual at earlier assessments, 60 to 70 percent continued to thus identify, while approximately 30 to 40 percent assumed a gay/lesbian identity over time. Rosario et al. suggested that "although there were youths who consistently self-identified as bisexual throughout the study, for other youths, a bisexual identity served as a transitional identity to a subsequent gay/lesbian identity."&lt;ref name="Rosario"/&gt;

By contrast, a longitudinal study by [[Lisa M. Diamond]], which followed women identifying as lesbian, bisexual, or unlabeled, found that "more women adopted bisexual/unlabeled identities than relinquished these identities", over a ten-year period. The study also found that "bisexual/unlabeled women had stable overall distributions of same-sex/other-sex attractions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Lisa M.|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2008|volume=44|issue=1|pages=5–14|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.44.1.5|pmid=18194000|title=Female bisexuality from adolescence to adulthood: results from a 10-year longitudinal study}}&lt;!--|access-date=19 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond has also studied male bisexuality, noting that survey research found "almost as many men transitioned at some point from a gay identity to a bisexual, queer or unlabeled one, as did from a bisexual identity to a gay identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Scientific Quest to Prove Bisexuality Exists|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/magazine/the-scientific-quest-to-prove-bisexuality-exists.html|work=The New York Times|access-date=21 March 2014|first=Benoit|last=Denizet-Lewis|date=20 March 2014|archive-date=14 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200514181747/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/magazine/the-scientific-quest-to-prove-bisexuality-exists.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Sexuality Preconference|url=http://www.sexatspsp.com/schedule/|work=Fifteenth Annual Meeting of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology - Preconferences|publisher=Society for Personality and Social Psychology|access-date=21 March 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321072854/http://www.sexatspsp.com/schedule/|archive-date=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There may also be a difference between sexual and romantic attractions in bisexuals over time. One study found that in the short term bisexual men and women were much more likely to change their sexual behavior than heterosexual or homosexual individuals. Bisexual men were less likely to have a change in romantic attraction but those that did were more likely to have a greater change than in sexual feelings while bisexual women were more likely than bisexual men to have a change in romantic attraction. This suggests that sexual and romantic attraction is not fixed for bisexual individuals and changes over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kimmel|first1=Michael S.|last2=Weinberg|first2=Martin S.|last3=Williams|first3=Colin J.|last4=Pryor|first4=Douglas W.|date=May 1995|title=Dual Attraction: Understanding Bisexuality.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2076509|journal=Contemporary Sociology|volume=24|issue=3|page=365|doi=10.2307/2076509|jstor=2076509|issn=0094-3061|access-date=4 December 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kinsey scale ===
{{Main|Kinsey scale}}

In the 1940s, the zoologist [[Alfred Kinsey]] created a scale to measure the continuum of sexual orientation from heterosexuality to homosexuality. Kinsey studied human sexuality and argued that people have the capability of being hetero- or homosexual even if this trait does not present itself in the current circumstances.&lt;ref name="Young-Bruehl"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Young-Bruehl |first=Elisabeth |title=Are Human Beings "By Nature" Bisexual? |journal=Studies in Gender and Sexuality |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=179–213 |year=2001 |doi=10.1080/15240650209349175|s2cid=145118033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kinsey scale is used to describe a person's sexual experience or response at a given time. It ranges from 0, meaning exclusively heterosexual, to 6, meaning exclusively homosexual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iub.edu/~kinsey/research/ak-hhscale.html Kinseys hetero homo rating scale] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817050313/http://www.iub.edu/~kinsey/research/ak-hhscale.html |date=17 August 2011 }} Retrieved 7 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; People who rank anywhere from 2 to 4 are often considered bisexual; they are often not fully one extreme or the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Szymanski|first1=Mike|title=Moving Closer to the Middle: ''Kinsey'' the Movie, and Its Rocky Road to Bisexual Acceptance|journal=Journal of Bisexuality|date=2008|volume=8|issue=3–4|pages=287–308|doi=10.1080/15299710802501918|s2cid=143517794}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologists [[Martin S. Weinberg]] and [[Colin J. Williams]] write that, in principle, people who rank anywhere from one to five could be considered bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Weinberg, Martin S. |url=https://archive.org/details/dualattractionun00wein/page/41/mode/2up |title=Dual Attraction: Understanding Bisexuality |author2=Williams, Colin J. |author3=Pryor, Douglas W. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-19-509841-9 |location=New York |page=41 |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist Jim McKnight writes that while the idea that bisexuality is a form of sexual orientation intermediate between homosexuality and heterosexuality is implicit in the Kinsey scale, that conception has been "severely challenged" since the publication of ''[[Homosexualities]]'' (1978), by Weinberg and the psychologist [[Alan P. Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, Jim. ''Straight Science: Homosexuality, Evolution and Adaptation''. Routledge, 1997, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Criticism ====
The Kinsey scale is criticized for various reasons. One of the main reasons is the inverse relation in attraction to males and females that the Kinsey scale represents. The Kinsey scale says that having a higher level attraction to one gender results in less attraction to the other, which some studies do not support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Zietsch|first1=Brendan P.|last2=Sidari|first2=Morgan J.|date=2020-11-03|title=The Kinsey scale is ill-suited to most sexuality research because it does not measure a single construct|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=117|issue=44|page=27080|doi=10.1073/pnas.2015820117|pmc=7959566|issn=0027-8424|pmid=33144520|bibcode=2020PNAS..11727080Z |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect of the Kinsey scale can impact the results of studies that utilize the scale, as there is a biological difference between bisexuals and gay people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.aat7693 | title=Large-scale GWAS reveals insights into the genetic architecture of same-sex sexual behavior |doi-access=free | date=2019 | last1=Ganna | first1=Andrea | last2=Verweij | first2=Karin J.

{{Main|Scales of sexual orientation}}
{{Bisexuality topics sidebar}}
* [[Klein Sexual Orientation Grid]]
** A more descriptive orientation grid that takes into account: Sexual attraction, sexual behavior, sexual fantasies, emotional preference, social preference, lifestyle preference, and self-identification. It also has different measures for certain variables and is not binary by design.
* Shively Scale
** Measures physical and affectional attraction on two separate scales.
* Sell Assessment of Sexual Orientation
** Measures sexual attraction, sexual orientation identity, and sexual behavior and reports the extent of all of those factors.
* Multidimensional Scale of Sexuality (MSS)
** Uses nine categories to categorize bisexuality. These categories are evaluated on sexual behavior, sexual attraction, arousal to erotic material, emotional factors, and sexual dreams and fantasies. The combined answers to all of these questions make up the score.

{{Main|Demographics of sexual orientation}}

Scientific estimates as to the prevalence of bisexuality have varied from 0.7 to 8 percent.

[[Magnus Hirschfeld]] argued that adult sexual orientation can be explained in terms of the bisexual nature of the developing fetus: he believed that in every embryo there is one rudimentary neutral center for attraction to males and another for attraction to females. In most fetuses, the center for attraction to the opposite sex developed while the center for attraction to the same sex regressed, but in fetuses that became homosexual, the reverse occurred. [[Simon LeVay]] has criticized Hirschfeld's theory of an early bisexual stage of development, calling it confusing; LeVay maintains that Hirschfeld failed to distinguish between saying that the brain is sexually undifferentiated at an early stage of development and saying that an individual actually experiences sexual attraction to both men and women. According to LeVay, Hirschfeld believed that in most bisexual people the strength of attraction to the same sex was relatively low, and that it was therefore possible to restrain its development in young people, something Hirschfeld supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=LeVay, Simon |author-link=Simon LeVay |title=Queer Science: The Use and Abuse of Research into Homosexuality |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-262-12199-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/queerscienceusea00leva/page/18 18–20] |url=https://archive.org/details/queerscienceusea00leva/page/18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirschfeld created a ten-point scale to measure the strength of sexual desire, with the direction of desire being represented by the letters A (for heterosexuality), B (for homosexuality), and A + B (for bisexuality). On this scale, someone who was A3, B9 would be weakly attracted to the opposite sex and very strongly attracted to the same sex, an A0, B0 would be asexual, and an A10, B10 would be very attracted to both sexes. LeVay compares Hirschfeld's scale to that developed by Kinsey decades later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Simon

[[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]], believed that every human being is bisexual in the sense of incorporating general attributes of both sexes. In his view, this was true anatomically and therefore also psychologically, with sexual attraction to both sexes being an aspect of this psychological bisexuality. Freud believed that in the course of sexual development the masculine side of this bisexual disposition would normally become dominant in men and the feminine side in women, but that all adults still have desires derived from both the masculine and the feminine sides of their natures. Freud did not claim that everyone is bisexual in the sense of feeling the same level of sexual attraction to men and women. Freud's belief in innate bisexuality was rejected by [[Sandor Rado|Sándor Radó]] in 1940 and, following Radó, by many later psychoanalysts. Radó argued that there is no biological bisexuality in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruse |first=Michael |url=https://archive.org/details/homosexualityphi0000ruse/page/22/mode/2up |title=Homosexuality: A Philosophical Inquiry |date=1988 |publisher=Basil Blackwell |isbn=0-631-15275-X |location=Oxford, England |pages=22, 25, 45, 46 |author-link=Michael Ruse |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan P. Bell]], [[Martin S. Weinberg]], and Sue Kiefer Hammersmith reported in ''[[Sexual Preference (book)|Sexual Preference]]'' (1981) that sexual preference was much less strongly connected with pre-adult sexual feelings among bisexuals than it was among heterosexuals and homosexuals. Based on this and other findings, they suggested that bisexuality is more influenced by social and sexual learning than is exclusive homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bell |first1=Alan P. |url=https://archive.org/details/sexualpreference0000bell/page/200/mode/2up |title=Sexual Preference: Its Development in Men and Women |last2=Weinberg |first2=Martin S. |last3=Hammersmith |first3=Sue Kiefer |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-253-16673-9 |location=Bloomington, Indiana |pages=200–201 |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Letitia Anne Peplau et al. wrote that while Bell et al.'s view "sounds plausible, it has not been tested explicitly and seems at odds with available evidence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.peplaulab.ucla.edu/Peplau_Lab/Publications_files/Peplau%20et%20al.%2099_1.pdf |title=The Development of Sexual Orientation in Women |access-date=11 July 2017 |first1=Letitia Anne|last1=Peplau |first2=Leah R.|last2=Spalding |first3=Terri D.|last3=Conley |first4=Rosemary C.|last4=Veniegas |journal=[[Annual Review of Sex Research]] |date=1999 |volume=10 |pages=70–99 |pmid=10895248 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305191912/http://www.peplaulab.ucla.edu/Peplau_Lab/Publications_files/Peplau%20et%20al.%2099_1.pdf |archive-date=5 March 2016 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human bisexuality has mainly been studied alongside homosexuality. Van Wyk and Geist argue that this is a problem for sexuality research because the few studies that have observed bisexuals separately have found that bisexuals are often different from both heterosexuals and homosexuals. Furthermore, bisexuality does not always represent a halfway point between the dichotomy. Research indicates that bisexuality is influenced by biological, cognitive and cultural variables in interaction, and this leads to different types of bisexuality.&lt;ref name=VanWyk&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Van Wyk PH, Geist CS |title=Biology of Bisexuality: Critique and Observations |journal=Journal of Homosexuality |volume=28 |issue=3–4 |pages=357–373 |year=1995 |doi=10.1300/J082v28n03_11 |pmid=7560936 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4qrrAgAAQBAJ&amp;q=biology+of+bisexuality+van+wyk&amp;pg=PA357 |isbn=9781317764519 |access-date=14 October 2020 |archive-date=16 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210416084247/https://books.google.com/books?id=4qrrAgAAQBAJ&amp;q=biology+of+bisexuality+van+wyk&amp;pg=PA357 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the current debate around influences on sexual orientation, biological explanations have been questioned by social scientists, particularly by feminists who encourage women to make conscious decisions about their life and sexuality. A difference in attitude between homosexual men and women has also been reported, with men more likely to regard their sexuality as biological, "reflecting the universal male experience in this culture, not the complexities of the lesbian world." There is also evidence that women's sexuality may be more strongly affected by cultural and contextual factors.&lt;ref name=Veniegas&gt;{{cite journal |last=Veniegas |first=Rosemary c. |author2=Terri D.

American academic [[Camille Paglia]] has promoted bisexuality as an ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Paglia, Camille |url=https://archive.org/details/vampstrampsnewes0000pagl_w9j0/page/94/mode/2up |title=Vamps and Tramps: New Essays |publisher=Penguin Books |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-14-024828-9 |location=New York |page=94 |author-link=Camille Paglia |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Harvard professor [[Marjorie Garber]] made an academic case for bisexuality with her 1995 book ''Vice Versa: Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life,'' in which she argued that most people would be bisexual if not for repression and other factors such as lack of sexual opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Garber, Marjorie B. |author-link=Marjorie Garber |title=Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-415-92661-4 |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brain structure and chromosomes ===
LeVay's (1991) examination at autopsy of 18 homosexual men, 1 bisexual man, 16 presumably heterosexual men and 6 presumably heterosexual women found that the [[INAH 3]] nucleus of the anterior [[hypothalamus]] of homosexual men was smaller than that of heterosexual men and closer in size of heterosexual women. Although grouped with homosexuals, the INAH 3 size of the one bisexual subject was similar to that of the heterosexual men.&lt;ref name=VanWyk/&gt;

Some evidence supports the concept of biological precursors of bisexual orientation in genetic males. According to [[John Money]] (1988), genetic males with an [[XYY syndrome#Cognitive and behavioral traits|extra Y chromosome]] are more likely to be bisexual, [[paraphilia|paraphilic]] and impulsive.&lt;ref name=VanWyk/&gt;

=== Evolutionary theory ===
Some evolutionary psychologists have argued that same-sex attraction does not have adaptive value because it has no association with potential [[reproductive success]]. Instead, bisexuality can be due to normal variation in brain plasticity. More recently, it has been suggested that same-sex alliances may have helped males climb the social hierarchy giving access to females and reproductive opportunities. Same-sex allies could have helped females to move to the safer and resource richer center of the group, which increased their chances of raising their offspring successfully.&lt;ref name=Muscarella/&gt; Likewise, Barron and Hare suggest that same-sex attraction is a [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrel]] of prosocial traits, which has been consistently [[Natural selection|selected]] among humans over time. These prosocial traits include social affiliation, communication, integration, as well as reduced reactive aggression among members of the same sex.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Barron |first1=Andrew B. |last2=Hare |first2=Brian |date=2020 |title=Prosociality and a Sociosexual Hypothesis for the Evolution of Same-Sex Attraction in Humans |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=10 |page=2955 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02955 |pmid=32010022 |pmc=6976918 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Buss]] criticized the alliance hypothesis, stating that there is no evidence that most young men in most cultures use sexual behavior to establish alliances; instead, the norm is for same-sex alliances to not be accompanied by any sexual activity.&lt;ref name=BussCh5&gt;{{cite book |last=Buss |first=David |date=2019 |edition=Sixth |title=Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the Mind |chapter=Men's Long-Term Mating Strategies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sn6JDwAAQBAJ |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780429590061 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he states that there is no evidence that men who engage in bisexual behavior do better than other men at forming alliances or ascending in status.&lt;ref name=BussCh5/&gt; Barron and Hare state that there are ethnographic examples of same-sex activity being used to strengthen social bonds among males and females.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Brendan Zietsch of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research proposes the alternative theory that men exhibiting female traits become more attractive to females and are thus more likely to mate, provided the genes involved do not drive them to complete rejection of heterosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12465295|title=The evolution of homosexuality: Gender bending - The Economist|newspaper=The Economist|access-date=20 March 2015|archive-date=20 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100320003555/http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12465295|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barron and Hare concur and argue that this is one of the reasons why bisexuality is more common than exclusive homosexuality among animal populations, including human populations. However, this is underreported due to enforced binary dichotomies in previous research and cultural factors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Also, in a 2008 study, its authors stated that "There is considerable evidence that human sexual orientation is genetically influenced, so it is not known how homosexuality, which tends to lower reproductive success, is maintained in the population at a relatively high frequency." They hypothesized that "while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals' reproductive success, they may confer some advantage in heterosexuals who carry them" and their results suggested that "genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals, which could help explain the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zietsch | first1 = B. | last2 = Morley | first2 = K. | last3 = Shekar | first3 = S. | last4 = Verweij | first4 = K. | last5 = Keller | first5 = M. | last6 = Macgregor | first6 = S. | year = 2008 | title = Genetic factors predisposing to homosexuality may increase mating success in heterosexuals | journal = Evolution and Human Behavior | volume = 29 | issue = 6| pages = 424–433 | doi = 10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2008.07.002 | display-authors = 6 | last7 = Wright | first7 = M | last8 = Bailey | first8 = J | last9 = Martin | first9 = N| bibcode = 2008EHumB..29..424Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barron and Hare say that this finding is only shown in Western European societies, with said finding being weakly supported in "other populations or cultures".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Masculinization ===
[[Masculinization]] of women and hypermasculinization of men has been a central theme in sexual orientation research. There are several studies suggesting that bisexuals have a high degree of masculinization. LaTorre and Wendenberg (1983) found differing personality characteristics for bisexual, heterosexual and homosexual women. Bisexuals were found to have fewer personal insecurities than heterosexuals and homosexuals. This finding described bisexuals as self-assured and less likely to have mental instabilities. The confidence of a secure identity consistently translated to more masculinity than other subjects. This study did not explore societal norms, prejudices, or the feminization of homosexual males.&lt;ref name=VanWyk/&gt;

In a research comparison, published in the ''Journal of the Association for Research in [[Otolaryngology]]'', women usually have a better hearing sensitivity than males, assumed by researchers as a genetic disposition connected to child bearing. Homosexual and bisexual women have been found to have a hypersensitivity to sound in comparison to heterosexual women, suggesting a genetic disposition to not tolerate high pitched tones. While heterosexual, homosexual and bisexual men have been found to exhibit similar patterns of hearing, there was a notable differential in a sub-group of males identified as hyperfeminized homosexual males who exhibited test results similar to heterosexual women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = McFadden| first = D.| author2 = Champlin, CA| title = Comparison of auditory evoked potentials in heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual males and females| journal = JARO&amp;nbsp;– Journal of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology| volume = 1| issue = 1| pages = 89–99| date = March 2000| doi = 10.1007/s101620010008| pmid = 11548240| pmc = 2504562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prenatal hormones ===
The prenatal hormonal theory of sexual orientation suggests that people who are exposed to excess levels of sex hormones have masculinized brains and show increased homosexuality or bisexuality. Studies providing evidence for the masculinization of the brain have, however, not been conducted to date. Research on special conditions such as [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH) and exposure to [[diethylstilbestrol]] (DES) indicate that prenatal exposure to, respectively, excess [[testosterone]] and [[estrogen]]s are associated with female–female sex fantasies in adults. Both effects are associated with bisexuality rather than homosexuality.&lt;ref name=Veniegas/&gt;

There is research evidence that the digit [[ratio]] of the length of the 2nd and 4th digits (index finger and ring finger) is somewhat negatively related to prenatal testosterone and positively to estrogen. Studies measuring the fingers found a statistically significant skew in the 2D:4D ratio (long ring finger) towards homosexuality with an even lower ratio in bisexuals. It is suggested that exposure to high prenatal testosterone and low prenatal estrogen concentrations is one cause of homosexuality whereas exposure to very high testosterone levels may be associated with bisexuality. Because testosterone in general is important for sexual differentiation, this view offers an alternative to the suggestion that male homosexuality is genetic.&lt;ref name=pmid11053694&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1090-5138(00)00052-0 |pmid=11053694 |title=The ratio of 2nd to 4th digit length and male homosexuality |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=333–345 |year=2000 |last1=Robinson |first1=S |last2=Manning |first2=J. T |bibcode=2000EHumB..21..333R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prenatal hormonal theory suggests that a homosexual orientation results from exposure to excessive testosterone causing an over-masculinized brain. This is contradictory to another hypothesis that homosexual preferences may be due to a feminized brain in males. However, it has also been suggested that homosexuality may be due to high prenatal levels of unbound testosterone that results from a lack of receptors at particular brain sites. Therefore, the brain could be feminized while other features, such as the 2D:4D ratio could be over-masculinized.&lt;ref name=Muscarella/&gt;

=== Sex drive ===
Van Wyk and Geist summarized several studies comparing bisexuals with hetero- or homosexuals that have indicated that bisexuals have higher rates of sexual activity, fantasy, or erotic interest. These studies found that male and female bisexuals had more heterosexual fantasy than heterosexuals or homosexuals; that bisexual men had more sexual activities with women than did heterosexual men, and that they masturbated more but had fewer happy marriages than heterosexuals; that bisexual women had more orgasms per week and they described them as stronger than those of hetero- or homosexual women; and that bisexual women became heterosexually active earlier, masturbated and enjoyed masturbation more, and were more experienced in different types of heterosexual contact.&lt;ref name=VanWyk/&gt;

Research suggests that, for most women, high sex drive is associated with increased sexual attraction to both women and men. For men, however, high sex drive is associated with increased attraction to one sex or the other, but not to both, depending on sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lippa | first1 = R. A. | year = 2006 | title = Is High Sex Drive Associated With Increased Sexual Attraction to Both Sexes?.

=== Sociosexuality ===
Richard A. Lippa proposed that there exist two dimensions of sexual orientation: a gender typicality dimension, and a monosexuality dimension. With the gender typicality dimension being associated with the [[heterosexual]]-[[homosexual]] distinction, while the [[sociosexuality]] dimension has many behavioral effects. He proposes someone who would be at any point in the heterosexual-homosexual spectrum will become bisexual if they are high on the sociosexuality dimension. This dimension being associated with higher sociosexuality, higher [[neuroticism]], lower [[agreeableness]], lower [[Honesty-humility factor of the HEXACO model of personality|honesty-humility]], higher [[openness to experience]], and a minor degree of [[Gender variance|gender nonconformity]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lippa|first=Richard A.|date=February 2020|title=Interest, Personality, and Sexual Traits That Distinguish Heterosexual, Bisexual, and Homosexual Individuals: Are There Two Dimensions That Underlie Variations in Sexual Orientation?|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31989410/|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=49|issue=2|pages=607–622|doi=10.1007/s10508-020-01643-9|issn=1573-2800|pmid=31989410|s2cid=210934137|access-date=3 February 2022|archive-date=3 February 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220203001734/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31989410/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposes this as explaining phenomena such as increased [[juvenile delinquency]] among bisexuals,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Beaver|first1=Kevin M.|last2=Connolly|first2=Eric J.|last3=Schwartz|first3=Joseph A.|last4=Boutwell|first4=Brian B.|last5=Barnes|first5=J.

===General social impacts===
The bisexual community (also known as the bisexual/pansexual, bi/pan/fluid, or non-monosexual community) includes members of the [[LGBTQ community]] who identify as bisexual, pansexual or fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://binetusa.blogspot.com/2009/04/we-are-all-somewhere-between-straight.html|title=We are all somewhere between straight and gay|last=Estraven|date=20 April 2009|publisher=[[BiNet USA]] News and Opinions|access-date=24 March 2011|archive-date=8 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708025654/http://binetusa.blogspot.com/2009/04/we-are-all-somewhere-between-straight.html|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because some bisexual people do not feel that they fit into either the gay or the heterosexual world, and because they have a tendency to be "invisible" in public, some bisexual persons are committed to forming their own communities, culture, and political movements. Some who identify as bisexual may merge themselves into either homosexual or heterosexual society. Other bisexual people see this merging as enforced rather than voluntary; bisexual people can face exclusion from both homosexual and heterosexual society on coming out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14681994.2017.1419566|doi = 10.1080/14681994.2017.1419566|title = Mapping the bisexual experience of a Keralite woman: Glimpses into India|year = 2018|last1 = Chithrangathan|first1 = Chinchu|journal = Sexual and Relationship Therapy|volume = 33|issue = 1–2|pages = 135–145|s2cid = 148780872|access-date = 10 September 2020|archive-date = 6 October 2021|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211006020912/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14681994.2017.1419566|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist Beth Firestein states that bisexuals tend to internalize social tensions related to their choice of partners&lt;ref name="newgen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb02/generation.html |title=A new generation of issues for LGBT clients |access-date=16 February 2007 |author=DeAngelis, Tori |date=February 2002 |work=Monitor on Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |archive-date=13 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190913053156/https://www.apa.org/monitor/feb02/generation.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and feel pressured to label themselves as homosexuals instead of occupying the difficult middle ground where attraction to people of both sexes would defy society's value on monogamy.&lt;ref name="newgen"/&gt; These social tensions and pressure may affect bisexuals' mental health, and specific therapy methods have been developed for bisexuals to address this concern.&lt;ref name="newgen"/&gt;

Bisexual behaviors are also associated in popular culture with men who engage in same-sex activity while otherwise presenting as heterosexual. The majority of such men&amp;nbsp;— said to be ''living on the [[down-low (MSM)|down-low]]''&amp;nbsp;— do not self-identify as bisexual.&lt;ref name="boykin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keithboykin.com/arch/001311.html |title=10 Things You Should Know About the DL |access-date=23 February 2007 |author=Boykin, Keith |date=3 February 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427005112/http://www.keithboykin.com/arch/001311.html |archive-date=27 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this may be a cultural misperception closely related to that of other LGBTQ individuals who hide their actual orientation due to societal pressures, a phenomenon colloquially called ''"being [[closeted]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Alpert |first=Emily |date=2013-07-14 |title=Why bisexuals stay in the closet |url=https://www.latimes.com/local/la-xpm-2013-jul-14-la-me-bisexuality-20130715-story.html |access-date=2024-09-17 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{original research inline|date=December 2015}}

===Perceptions and discrimination===

Male bisexuality is particularly presumed to be non-existent,&lt;ref name="Eisner"/&gt; with [[sexual fluidity]] studies adding to the debate. In 2005, researchers Gerulf Rieger, [[Meredith Chivers|Meredith L. Chivers]], and [[J. Michael Bailey]] used [[penile plethysmography]] to measure the arousal of self-identified bisexual men to [[pornography]] involving only men and pornography involving only women. Participants were recruited via advertisements in gay-oriented magazines and an alternative paper. They found that the self-identified bisexual men in their sample had genital arousal patterns similar to either homosexual or heterosexual men. The authors concluded that "in terms of behavior and identity, bisexual men clearly exist", but that male bisexuality had not been shown to exist with respect to arousal or attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rieger G, Chivers ML, Bailey JM |title=Sexual arousal patterns of bisexual men |journal=Psychological Science |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=579–84 |year=2005 |pmid=16102058 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01578.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.502.8782 |s2cid=14108499 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers hold that the technique used in the study to measure genital arousal is too crude to capture the richness (erotic sensations, affection, admiration) that constitutes sexual attraction.&lt;ref name="Carey"/&gt; The [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]] called the study and ''[[The New York Times]]'' coverage of it flawed and biphobic.&lt;ref name=ngltf&gt;{{cite web | author = National Gay and Lesbian Task Force | date = July 2005 | url = http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/reports/NYTBisexualityFactSheet.pdf | title = The Problems with "Gay, Straight, or Lying?" | access-date = 24 July 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131016135808/http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/reports/NYTBisexualityFactSheet.pdf | archive-date = 16 October 2013 | url-status = dead| author-link = National Gay and Lesbian Task Force }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common symbol of the [[bisexual community]] is the [[bisexual flag]], designed by Michael Page and unveiled in 1998, which has a deep pink stripe at the top for homosexuality, a blue one on the bottom for heterosexuality, and a purple one – blending the pink and blue – in the middle to represent bisexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biflag.com/Activism.asp |title=Bi Pride Flag |access-date=16 February 2007 |author=Page, Michael |quote=The pink color represents sexual attraction to the same sex only, homosexuality, the blue represents sexual attraction to the opposite sex only, heterosexuality, and the resultant overlap color purple represents sexual attraction to both sexes (bi). |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129080614/http://www.biflag.com/Activism.asp |archive-date=29 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another symbol with a similarly symbolic color scheme is the [[LGBT symbols#Biangles|biangles]] symbol of bisexuality, a pair of overlapping pink and blue triangles, forming lavender where they intersect.

=== In BDSM ===
In Steve Lenius' original 2001 paper, he explored the acceptance of bisexuality in a supposedly pansexual [[BDSM]] community. The reasoning behind this is that "coming-out" had become primarily the territory of the gay and lesbian, with bisexuals feeling the push to be one or the other (and being right only half the time either way). What he found in 2001, was that people in BDSM were open to discussion about the topic of bisexuality and pansexuality and all controversies they bring to the table, but personal biases and issues stood in the way of actively using such labels. A decade later, Lenius (2011) looked back on his study and considered if anything has changed. He concluded that the standing of bisexuals in the BDSM and kink community was unchanged, and believed that positive shifts in attitude were moderated by society's changing views towards different sexualities and orientations. But Lenius (2011) does emphasize that the pansexual promoting BDSM community helped advance greater acceptance of alternative sexualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lenius | first1 = S | year = 2001 | title = Bisexuals and BDSM | journal = [[Journal of Bisexuality]] | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 69–78 | doi=10.1300/j159v01n04_06| s2cid = 142599575 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lenius | first1 = S | year = 2011 | title = A Reflection on "Bisexuals and BDSM: Bisexual People in a Pansexual Community"—Ten Years Later (and a Preview of the Next Sexual Revolution) | journal = [[Journal of Bisexuality]] | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 420–425 | doi=10.1080/15299716.2011.620466| s2cid = 143156292 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brandy Lin Simula (2012), on the other hand, argues that BDSM actively resists gender conforming and identified three different types of BDSM bisexuality: [[Genderqueer|gender-switching]], gender-based styles (taking on a different gendered style depending on gender of partner when playing), and rejection of gender (resisting the idea that gender matters in their play partners). Simula (2012) explains that practitioners of BDSM routinely challenge our concepts of sexuality by pushing the limits on pre-existing ideas of sexual orientation and gender norms. For some, BDSM and kink provides a platform in creating identities that are fluid, ever-changing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simula | first1 = B.

=== In feminism ===
Feminist positions on bisexuality range greatly, from acceptance of bisexuality as a feminist issue to rejection of bisexuality as reactionary and anti-feminist [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]] to [[lesbian feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilkinson |first1=Sue |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/allragereasserti0000unse_e6m4/page/75/mode/2up |title=All the Rage: Reasserting Radical Lesbian Feminism |publisher=[[Teachers College, Columbia University|Teacher's College Press]] |others=Elaine Miller |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-807-76285-1 |editor1-last=Harne |editor1-first=Lynne |location=New York City |pages=75–89 |chapter=Bisexuality as Backlash |oclc=35202923 |chapter-url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of women who were at one time involved in lesbian-feminist activism have since come out as bisexual after realizing their attractions to men. A widely studied example of lesbian-bisexual conflict in feminism was the [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]] Pride March in [[Massachusetts]] during the years between 1989 and 1993, where many feminists involved debated over whether bisexuals should be included and whether or not bisexuality was compatible with feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sathanson|first=Jessica|date=17 October 2001|title=Pride and Politics: Revisiting the Northampton Pride March, 1989-1993|url=https://doi.org/10.1300/J159v02n02_10|journal=Journal of Bisexuality|volume=2|issue=2–3|pages=143–161|doi=10.1300/J159v02n02_10|s2cid=143296285|issn=1529-9716}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common lesbian-feminist critiques leveled at bisexuality were that bisexuality was [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]], that bisexuality was a form of [[false consciousness]], and that bisexual women who pursue relationships with men were "deluded and desperate." Tensions between bisexual feminists and lesbian feminists have eased since the 1990s, as bisexual women have become more accepted in the feminist community,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Routledge International Encyclopedia of Queer Culture|last= Gerstner|first= David A.|year= 2006|publisher= [[Routledge]]|location= United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-415-30651-5|pages= 82–3|access-date= 3 October 2012|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XS_SnVPixE8C&amp;pg=PA82|archive-date= 27 July 2020|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200727112041/https://books.google.com/books?id=XS_SnVPixE8C&amp;pg=PA82|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some lesbian feminists such as [[Julie Bindel]] are still critical of bisexuality.

[[Donna Haraway]] was the inspiration and genesis for [[cyberfeminism]] with her 1985 essay "A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century" which was reprinted in ''Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature'' (1991). Haraway's essay states that the cyborg "has no truck with bisexuality, pre-oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labor, or other seductions to organic wholeness through a final appropriation of all powers of the parts into a higher unity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egs.edu/faculty/donna-haraway/articles/donna-haraway-a-cyborg-manifesto/ |title=Donna Haraway - A Cyborg Manifesto |publisher=Egs.edu |access-date=15 September 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922114218/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/donna-haraway/articles/donna-haraway-a-cyborg-manifesto/ |archive-date=22 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Greeks and Romans did not associate sexual relations with well-defined labels, as modern Western society does. Men who had male lovers were not identified as homosexual, and may have had wives or other female lovers.

[[Ancient Greek]] religious texts, reflecting cultural practices, incorporated bisexual themes. The subtexts varied, from the mystical to the didactic.&lt;ref name="livius"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.livius.org/ho-hz/homosexuality/homosexuality.html |title=Greek Homosexuality |access-date=17 February 2007 |last=van Dolen |first=Hein |archive-date=3 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503175101/http://www.livius.org/ho-hz/homosexuality/homosexuality.html |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sparta]]ns thought that love and erotic relationships between experienced and novice soldiers would solidify combat loyalty and [[unit cohesion]], and encourage heroic tactics as men vied to impress their lovers. Once the younger soldiers reached maturity, the relationship was supposed to become non-sexual, but it is not clear how strictly this was followed. There was some stigma attached to young men who continued their relationships with their mentors into adulthood.&lt;ref name="livius"/&gt; For example, [[Aristophanes]] calls them ''euryprôktoi'', meaning "wide arses", and depicts them like women.&lt;ref name="livius"/&gt;

Similarly, in [[ancient Rome]], gender did not determine whether a sexual partner was acceptable, as long as a man's enjoyment did not encroach on another man's integrity. It was socially acceptable for a freeborn Roman man to want sex with both female and male partners, as long as he took the penetrative role.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amy Richlin]], ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'' (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; The morality of the behavior depended on the social standing of the partner, not gender ''per se''. Both women and young men were considered normal objects of desire, but outside marriage a man was supposed to act on his desires only with slaves, prostitutes (who were often slaves), and the ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|infames]]''. It was immoral to have sex with another freeborn man's wife, his marriageable daughter, his underage son, or with the man himself; sexual use of another man's slave was subject to the owner's permission. Lack of self-control, including in managing one's [[sex life]], indicated that a man was incapable of governing others; too much indulgence in "low sensual pleasure" threatened to erode the elite male's identity as a cultured person.&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Edwards, "Unspeakable Professions: Public Performance and Prostitution in Ancient Rome", in ''Roman Sexualities'', pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt; In early modern times, [[John Hoyle (died 1692)|John Hoyle]] was an Englishman known for his bisexuality.&lt;ref name="Robin Larsen Levin 2007 p. 48"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Robin | first1=D.M. | last2=Larsen | first2=A.R. | last3=Levin | first3=C. | title=Encyclopedia of Women in the Renaissance: Italy, France, and England | publisher=ABC-CLIO | series=Gale virtual reference library | year=2007 | isbn=978-1-85109-772-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OQ8mdTjxungC&amp;pg=PA48 | access-date=2023-02-23 | page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Kinsey]] conducted the first large surveys of homosexual behavior in the United States during the 1940s. The results shocked the readers of his day because they made same-sex behavior and attractions seem so common.&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt; His 1948 work ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]'' stated that among men "nearly half (46%) of the population engages in both heterosexual and homosexual activities, or reacts to persons of both sexes, in the course of their adult lives" and that "37% of the total male population has at least some overt homosexual experience to the point of orgasm since the onset of adolescence."&lt;ref name=Kinsey&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kinsey, Alfred C. |author2=Pomeroy, Wardell B. |author3=Martin, Clyde E. |title=Sexual Behavior in the Human Male |url=https://archive.org/details/sexualbehaviorin00kins |url-access=registration |publisher=W.

{{Main|Media portrayals of bisexuality}}

Bisexuality tends to be associated with negative media portrayals; references are sometimes made to stereotypes or mental disorders. In an article regarding the 2005 film ''Brokeback Mountain'', sex educator Amy Andre argued that in films, bisexuals are often depicted negatively:&lt;ref name="Andre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsrc.sfsu.edu/article/opinion_bisexual_cowboys_love|title=Opinion: Bisexual Cowboys in Love|last=Andre|first=Amy|date=16 December 2005|publisher=[[National Sexuality Resource Center]]|access-date=22 November 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210122058/http://nsrc.sfsu.edu/article/opinion_bisexual_cowboys_love|archive-date=10 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Blockquote|I like movies where bisexuals come out to each other together and fall in love, because these tend to be so few and far between; the most recent example would be 2002's lovely romantic comedy, ''[[Kissing Jessica Stein]]''. Most movies with bi characters paint a stereotypical picture.... The bi love interest is usually deceptive (''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''), over-sexed (''[[The Sex Monster|Sex Monster]]''), unfaithful (''[[High Art]]''), and fickle (''[[Three of Hearts (1993 film)|Three of Hearts]]''), and might even be a serial killer, like Sharon Stone in ''[[Basic Instinct]]''. In other words, the bisexual is always the cause of the conflict in the film.|Amy Andre|''American Sexuality Magazine''}}

Using a content analysis of more than 170 articles written between 2001 and 2006, [[sociology|sociologist]] Richard N. Pitt Jr. concluded that the media pathologized black bisexual men's behavior while either ignoring or sympathizing with white bisexual men's similar actions. He argued that the black bisexual man is often described as a ''duplicitous heterosexual'' man spreading the HIV/AIDS virus. Alternatively, the white bisexual man is often described in pitying language as a ''[[victimized]] homosexual'' man forced into the closet by the heterosexist society around him.&lt;ref name=Pitt&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pitt | first1 = Richard N.

In 1914 the first documented appearance of bisexual characters (female and male) in an American motion picture occurred in ''[[A Florida Enchantment]]'', by [[Sidney Drew]].&lt;ref name="glbtq_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/bisex_film.html |title=&gt;&gt; arts &gt;&gt; Bisexuality in Film |publisher=glbtq |access-date=6 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015093725/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/bisex_film.html |archive-date=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, under the censorship required by the [[Hays Code]], the word ''bisexual'' could not be mentioned, and almost no bisexual characters appeared in American film from 1934 until 1968.&lt;ref name="glbtq_a" /&gt;

Notable and varying portrayals of bisexuality can be found in mainstream movies such as  ''[[Something for Everyone (1970 film)|Something for Everyone]]'' (1970), ''[[Sunday Bloody Sunday (film)|Sunday Bloody Sunday]]'' (1971), ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975), ''[[The Fourth Man (1983 film)|The Fourth Man]]'' (1983), ''[[Henry &amp; June]]'' (1990), ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992), ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995), ''[[The Pillow Book (film)|The Pillow Book]]'' (1996), ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' (1997), ''[[Velvet Goldmine]]'' (1998), ''[[Kissing Jessica Stein]]'' (2001), ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001), ''[[Frida (2002 film)|Frida]]'' (2002), ''[[The Rules of Attraction (film)|The Rules of Attraction]]'' (2002), ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'' (2004), ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' (2005), ''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]'' (2010), and ''[[Call Me by Your Name (film)|Call Me by Your Name]]'' (2017).

=== Literature ===
[[Virginia Woolf]]'s ''[[Orlando: A Biography]]'' (1928) is an early example of bisexuality in literature. The story, of a man who changes into a woman without a second thought, was based on the life of Woolf's lover [[Vita Sackville-West]]. Woolf used the gender switch to avoid the book being banned for homosexual content. The pronouns switch from male to female as Orlando's gender changes. Woolf's lack of definite pronouns allows for ambiguity and lack of emphasis on gender labels.&lt;ref name="livia"&gt;Livia, Anna (2000). ''Pronoun Envy: Literary Uses of Linguistic Gender.'' Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|9780195138535}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her 1925 book ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' focused on a bisexual man and a bisexual woman in sexually unfulfilled heterosexual marriages in later life. Following Sackille-West's death, her son [[Nigel Nicolson]] published ''[[Portrait of a Marriage]]'', one of her diaries recounting her affair with a woman during her marriage to [[Harold Nicolson]]. Other early examples include works of [[D.H. Lawrence]], such as ''[[Women in Love]]'' (1920), and [[Colette]]'s ''[[Claudine à l'école|Claudine]]'' (1900–1903) series.

The main character in [[Patrick White]]'s novel, ''[[The Twyborn Affair]]'' (1979), is bisexual. Contemporary novelist [[Bret Easton Ellis]]' novels, such as ''[[Less than Zero (novel)|Less than Zero]]'' (1985) and ''[[The Rules of Attraction]]'' (1987) frequently feature bisexual male characters; this "casual approach" to bisexual characters recurs throughout Ellis' work.&lt;ref name="badboy"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.details.com/celebrities-entertainment/music-and-books/201006/author-bret-easton-ellis-less-than-zero-sequel-imperial-bedrooms|title=Bret Easton Ellis: Eternal Bad Boy|journal=[[Details (magazine)|Details]]|last=Gordinier|first=Jeff|date=June 2010|access-date=15 June 2010|archive-date=4 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604022830/http://www.details.com/celebrities-entertainment/music-and-books/201006/author-bret-easton-ellis-less-than-zero-sequel-imperial-bedrooms|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
Rock musician [[David Bowie]] famously declared himself bisexual in an interview with ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in January 1972, a move coinciding with the first shots in his campaign for stardom as [[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]].&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Roy; Murray, Charles Shaar (1981).

I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual. But I had no inclination to hold any banners or be a representative of any group of people. I knew what I wanted to be, which was a songwriter and a performer [...] America is a very puritanical place, and I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collis |first=Clark |title=Dear Superstar: David Bowie |work=blender.com |publisher=Alpha Media Group Inc |date=August 2002 |access-date=16 September 2010 |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=366 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510103103/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=366 |archive-date=10 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, [[Jill Sobule]] sang about [[bi-curious|bi-curiosity]] in her song "I Kissed a Girl", with a video that alternated images of Sobule and a boyfriend along with images of her with a girlfriend. Another [[I Kissed a Girl|song with the same name]] by [[Katy Perry]] also hints at the same theme.

In the [[BBC]] TV science fiction show ''[[Torchwood]]'', several of the main characters appear to have fluid sexuality. Most prominent among these is [[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]], a pansexual who is the lead character and an otherwise conventional science fiction action hero. Within the logic of the show, where characters can also interact with alien species, producers sometimes use the term "omnisexual" to describe him.&lt;ref name=Tribune&gt;{{cite news|first=Maureen|last=Ryan|title=Spike from 'Buffy' and 'Torchwood's Captain Jack Harkness&amp;nbsp;— Yowza!|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2007/07/spike-from-buff.html|work=Chicago Tribune|date=14 July 2007|access-date=2 June 2009|archive-date=23 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123085800/http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2007/07/spike-from-buff.html|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jack's ex, [[Captain John Hart (Torchwood)|Captain John Hart]], is also bisexual.&lt;ref name="Radio Times (James Marsters)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/content/features/james-marsters-interview/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20080120193337/http://www.radiotimes.com/content/features/james-marsters-interview/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=20 January 2008 |title=James Marsters Interview (January 2008) |access-date=25 January 2008 |work=[[Radio Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of his female exes, significantly at least one ex-wife and at least one woman with whom he has had a child have been indicated. Some critics draw the conclusion that the series more often shows Jack with men than women.&lt;ref name="Queer TV"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Glyn|last1=Davis|first2=Gary|last2=Needham|title=Queer TV|pages=153–156|isbn=978-0-415-45046-1|publisher=[[Routledge]] (28 January 2009)|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creator [[Russell T Davies]] says one of pitfalls of writing a bisexual character is you "fall into the trap" of "only having them sleep with men." He describes of the show's [[Torchwood: Miracle Day|fourth series]], "You'll see the full range of his appetites, in a really properly done way."&lt;ref name="ATVmoredetails"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atvnewsnetwork.co.uk/today/index.php/atv-today/3540-more-torchwood-details-revealed |title=More Torchwood details revealed |last=Knight |first=Dominic |work=[[Associated Television|Associated Television Network]] |access-date=8 August 2010 |date=8 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414165618/http://www.atvnewsnetwork.co.uk/today/index.php/atv-today/3540-more-torchwood-details-revealed |archive-date=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preoccupation with bisexuality has been seen by critics as complementary to other aspects of the show's themes. For heterosexual character [[Gwen Cooper]], for whom Jack harbors romantic feelings, the new experiences she confronts at [[Torchwood Institute|Torchwood]], in the form of "affairs and homosexuality and the threat of death", connote not only the Other but a "missing side" to the Self.&lt;ref name=Stepmother&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Gwen's Evil Stepmother: Concerning Gloves and Magic Slippers|editor=Andrew Ireland|last=Frankel|first=Valerie Estelle|year=2010|pages=90–101|title=Illuminating Torchwood: Essays on Narrative, Character and Sexuality in the BBC Series|isbn=9780786455607|publisher=McFarland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of an alien pheromone, Gwen kisses a woman in [[Day One (Torchwood)|Episode 2]] of the series. In [[Everything Changes (Torchwood)|Episode 1]], heterosexual [[Owen Harper]] kisses a man to escape a fight when he is about to take the man's girlfriend. Quiet [[Toshiko Sato]] is in love with Owen, but has also had brief romantic relationships with a female alien and a male human.
