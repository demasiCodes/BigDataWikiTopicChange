[[Image:Women montage, black borders, darker Frau background.jpg|thumb|290px|Diverse women. Most women customarily wear clothing, considering nudity more private or intimate.]] A '''woman' '' is a [[female]] [[human]]. &lt;!--The word adult is not needed in this sentence; see the following sentence.--&gt; The term ''woman'' (irregular plural: ''women'') usually is used for an adult, with the term [[girl]] being the usual term for a female child or adolescent. However, the term ''woman'' is also sometimes used to identify a female human, regardless of age, as in phrases such as "[[Women's rights]]".

== Etymology ==
[[Image:Symbol_venus.svg|thumb|80px|left|Symbol of the planet Venus, also used to indicate the female gender among animals who reproduce sexually]]
The [[English language|English]] term "[[Pan]]" (from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''[[mannaz]]'' "man, person") and words derived therefrom can designate any or even all of the human race regardless of their gender or age. This is indeed the oldest usage of "Man" in English. This derives from
a Proto-Indo-European root *man-" meaning hand. A similar cognate is Old Norse "mund", hand. The distinctive and dexterous hands of humans, compared to those of other animals, are the basis of this term and the similarly derived term, "manual", by hand.

In [[Old English language|Old English]] the words ''wer'' and ''wyf'' (also ''wæpman'' and ''wifman'') were what was used to refer to "a man" and "a woman" respectively, and "Man" was gender neutral. In [[Middle English]] [[man]] displaced wer as term for "male human", whilst wyfman (which eventually evolved into woman) was retained for "female human". "Man" does continue to carry its original sense of "[[Human]]" however, resulting in an [[asymmetry]] sometimes criticized as sexist. [http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=man] (See also [[Womyn]].)

The symbol for the planet [[Venus]] is the sign also used in biology for the female gender (in species with a male gender; all species have females but many have no males): a stylized representation of the goddess Venus's hand [[mirror]] or an abstract symbol for the goddess: a circle with a small equilateral cross underneath ([[Unicode]]: ♀). The Venus symbol also represented [[femininity]], and in ancient alchemy stood for [[copper]]. Alchemists constructed the symbol from a circle (representing [[spirit]]) above an equilateral cross (representing [[matter]]).

== Age and terminology ==
[[Image:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - Bather (1870).jpg|thumb|right|Painting by [[William Adolphe Bouguereau]]- [[Bather]]]]
[[Womanhood]] is the period in a female's life after she has transitioned from girlhood, at least physically, having passed the [[menarche]]. Many cultures have [[rites of passage]] to symbolize a woman's [[coming of age]], such as confirmation in some branches of [[Christianity]], [[bat mitzvah]] in [[Judaism]], or even just the custom of a special celebration for a certain [[birthday]] (generally between 12 and 21).

The word ''woman'' can be used generally, to mean any female human, or specifically, to mean an adult female human as contrasted with ''girl''. The word ''girl'' originally meant "young person of either sex" in English; it was only around the beginning of the [[16th century]] that it came to mean specifically a ''female'' [[child]]. Nowadays ''girl'' sometimes is used colloquially to refer to a young or unmarried woman. During the early [[1970s]] feminists challenged such use, and use of the word to refer to a fully grown woman may cause offence. In particular previously common terms like ''office girl'' are no longer used.

Conversely, in certain cultures which link family [[honor]] with female [[virginity]], the word ''girl'' is still used to refer to a never-married woman; in this sense it is used in a fashion roughly analogous to the obsolete English ''maid'' or ''maiden''. Referring to an unmarried female as ''woman'' may, in such a culture, imply that she is sexually experienced, which would be an insult to her family.

In some settings, the use of ''girl'' to refer to an adult female is a vestigial practice (such as ''girls' night out''), even among some elderly women. In this sense, ''girl'' may be considered to be the analogue to the British word ''bloke'' for a man, although it again fails to meet the parallel status as an adult and the only true American English parallel to ''girl'' is ''boy''. Many cite this lack of an informal yet respectful term for women as [[Misogyny#Misogyny in language|misogynistic]]; &lt;!--Removed guy, which sometimes is used to mean, people, even though guy means male adult in French.--&gt; they regard non-parallel usages, such as ''men and girls,'' as [[sexism|sexist]]. A number of other derogatory terms for women are also in common use.

There are various words used to refer to the quality of being a woman. The term "womanhood" merely means the state of being a woman, having passed the [[menarche]]; "femininity" is used to refer to a set of supposedly typical female qualities associated with a certain attitude to [[gender role]]s; "womanliness" is like "femininity", but is usually associated with a different view of gender roles; "femaleness" is a general term, but is often used as shorthand for "human femaleness"; "distaff" is an archaic adjective derived from women's conventional role as a spinner, now used only as a deliberate [[archaism]]; "[[muliebrity]]" is a "neologism" (derived from the Latin) meant to provide a female counterpart of "[[virility]]", but used very loosely, sometimes to mean merely "womanhood", sometimes "femininity", and sometimes even as a collective term for women.

== Biology and gender ==
[[Image:Female anatomy frontal.png|right|frame|The human female [[reproductive system]]]]

In terms of [[biology]], the female [[sex organ]]s are involved in the reproductive system, whereas the [[secondary sex characteristic]]s are involved in nurturing children or, in some cultures, attracting a mate. The [[ovaries]], in addition to their regulatory function producing hormones, produce female gametes called eggs which, when combined with male gametes ([[sperm]]), can mature into new individuals. The [[uterus]] is an organ with tissue to protect and nurture the developing fetus and muscle to expel it when giving birth. The [[vagina]] is used in copulation and birthing (although the word [[vagina]] is sometimes colloquially or ignorantly used for the [[vulva]] or external female genitalia, which also includes the [[labia]], the [[clitoris]], and the female [[urethra]]). The [[breast]] evolved from the sweat gland to produce milk, a nutritious secretion that is the most distinctive characteristic of Mammals. In mature women, the breast is generally more prominent than in most other mammals; this prominence, not necessary to produce milk, is probably at least partially the result of [[sexual selection]]. (For other ways in which men commonly differ physically from women, see [[Man#Biology and Gender|Man]].)

An imbalance of maternal hormonal levels and some chemicals (or drugs) may alter the secondary sexual characteristics of fetuses. Most women have the [[karyotype]] 46,XX, but around one in a thousand will be 47,XXX, and one in 2500 will be [[Turner syndrome|45,X]]. This contrasts with the typical male [[karotype]] of 46,XY; thus, the [[x chromosome|X]] and [[Y chromosome]]s are known as female and male, respectively. Unlike the Y chromosome, the X can come from either the [[mother]] or the [[father]], thus genetic studies which focus on the female line use [[Human mitochondrial genetics|mitochondrial DNA]].

Biological factors are not the sole determinants of whether persons can be considered, or consider themselves, women. Some women can have abnormal hormonal or chromosomal differences (such as [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], complete or partial [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]], or other [[intersex]] conditions), and there are women who may have, or have had prior to surgical intervention, physiology that would be considered typical in a male (''trans'', [[transgender]]ed or [[transsexual]] women; there are varying social, legal, and individual definitions with regard to this issue). (See [[gender identity]].)

[[Image:Flapper_nude_woman_1920.jpg|thumb|Picture of nude woman during the 1920's]]
Although fewer females than males are born (the ratio is around 1:1.05), due to a longer life expectancy there are only 81 men aged 60 or over for every 100 women of the same age, and among the oldest populations, there are only 53 men for every 100 women. Women have a lower death rate than men, and on average, live five years longer. This is due to a combination of factors: [[genetics]] (redundant and varied [[gene]]s present on [[sex chromosome]]s in women); [[sociology]] (such as not being expected in most countries to perform [[conscription|military service]]); [[health]]-impacting choices (such as [[suicide]] or the use of [[cigarette]]s, and [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]); the presence of the female hormone [[estrogen]], which has a cardioprotective effect in premenopausal women; and the effect of high levels of [[androgen]]s in men. Out of the total human population, there are 101.3 men for every 100 women (source: 2001 World Almanac).

After the onset of [[menarche]], most women are able to become [[pregnant]] and [[childbirth|bear children]]. This generally requires internal [[fertilization]] of her eggs with the sperm of a man through [[sexual reproduction|sexual intercourse]], though [[artificial insemination]] or the surgical implantation of an existing embryo is also possible (see [[reproductive technology]]). The study of female reproduction and [[sex organ|reproductive organ]]s is called [[gynaecology]]. Women generally reach [[menopause]] in their late 40s or early 50s, at which point their [[ovaries]] cease producing [[estrogen]] and they can no longer become pregnant.

To a large extent, women suffer from the same illnesses as men. However, there are some diseases that primarily affect women, such as [[lupus]]. Also, there are some [[sex-related illness]]es that are found more frequently or exclusively in women, e.g., [[breast cancer]], [[cervical cancer]], or [[ovarian cancer]]. Women and men may have different symptoms of an illness and may also respond differently to medical treatment. This area of medical research is studied by [[gender-based medicine]].

During early fetal development, embryos of both sexes appear female; the release of testosterone is what changes the female appearence to the male.

== Culture and gender roles ==

{{unsourcedsect}}

[[Image:Weaving_profile.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A [[Bengal]]i or [[Bangladesh]]i woman weaving. [[Textile]] work has historically been considered a female occupation in some cultures.]]
''Main article: [[Gender role]]''

In many [[prehistory|prehistoric]] cultures, women assumed a particular cultural role. In [[hunter-gatherer]] societies, women were generally the gatherers of plant foods, small animal foods, fish, and learned to use dairy products, while men hunted meat from large animals. Because of their intimate knowledge of plant life, most [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] assert that it was women who led the [[Neolithic Revolution]] and became history's first pioneers of [[agriculture]]. {{fact}}&lt;!--This needs to be sourced.--&gt;

In more recent history, the gender roles of women have changed greatly. Traditional gender roles for [[middle class|middle-class]] women typically involved domestic tasks emphasizing child care, and did not involve entering employment for wages. For poorer women, especially among the [[working class]]es, this often remained an ideal, for economic necessity has long compelled them to seek employment outside the home, although the occupations traditionally open to working-class women were lower in prestige and pay than those open to men. Eventually, restricting women from wage labor came to be a mark of wealth and prestige in a family, while the presence of working women came to mark a household as being lower-class.

The women's movement is in part a struggle for the recognition of [[equality of opportunity]] with men, and for [[equal rights]] irrespective of [[gender]], even if special relations and conditions are willingly incurred under the form of partnership involved in marriage. The difficulties of obtaining this recognition are due to historical factors combined with the habits and customs history has produced. Through a combination of [[economics|economic]] changes and the efforts of the [[feminism|feminist]] movement in recent decades women in most societies now have access to careers beyond the traditional one of "[[homemaker]]". Despite these advances, modern women in Western society still face challenges in the workplace as well as with the topics of education, violence, health care, politics, and motherhood, and others. [[Sexism]] can be a main concern and barrier for woman almost anywhere, though its forms, perception, and gravity varies between societies and social classes. (Sexism affects men as well, though the roles it leaves open for men are most commonly equal- or higher-status.)

These changes and struggles are among the foci of the [[academic]] field of [[women's studies]].
