A '''woman''' {{IPAc-en|'|w|ʊ|m|ə|n}}, pl: '''women''' {{IPAc-en|'|w|ɪ|m|i-|n}} is a [[female]] [[human]]. &lt;!--The word adult is not needed in this sentence; see the following sentence.--&gt; The term ''woman'' is usually reserved for an [[adult]], with the term [[girl]] being the usual term for a female [[child]] or [[Adolescence|adolescent]]. However, the term ''woman'' is also sometimes used to identify a female human, regardless of age, as in phrases such as "[[Women's rights]]". Women are typically capable of giving [[birth]] from puberty onwards, though older women who have gone through [[menopause]] and some [[intersex]] women cannot. Throughout history women have assumed various social roles in occupation. In some cultures, a majority of women have adopted specific appearances, such as wearing long hair.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History - Page xxii, Victoria Sherrow - 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The spelling of woman in English has progressed over the past millennium from '''wīfmann'''&lt;ref&gt;"wīfmann": Bosworth &amp; Toller, ''Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'' (Oxford, 1898-1921) p. 1219. The spelling "wifman" also occurs: C. T. Onions, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology]]'' (Oxford, 1966) p. 1011&lt;/ref&gt; to '''wīmmann''' to '''wumman''', and finally, the modern spelling '''woman'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World Dictionary, Second College Edition'', entry for "woman".&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Old English]], '''''wīfmann''''' meant "female human", whereas ''wēr'' meant "male human". ''Mann'' or ''monn'' had a gender-neutral meaning of "human", corresponding to Modern English "person" or "someone", however subsequent to the [[Norman Conquest]], ''man'' began to be used more in reference to "male human", and by the late 1200s had begun to eclipse usage of the older term ''wēr''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=man man] - definition Dictionary.reference.com&lt;/ref&gt; The medial labial consonants f and m in ''wīfmann'' coalesced into the modern form "woman", while the initial element, which meant "female", underwent semantic narrowing to the sense of a married woman ("wife"). It is a popular misconception that the term "woman" is etymologically connected with "womb", which is from a separate Old English word, ''wambe'' meaning "stomach" (of male or female). Nevertheless, such a false derivation of "woman" has appeared in print.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/wb/wb04.htm''The Woman's Bible'', By Elizabeth Cady Stanton and the Revising Committee, 1898]&lt;/ref&gt;

A very common Indo-European root for woman, *''g&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;en''-, is the source of modern English "[[queen regnant|queen]]" (Old English ''cwēn'' had primarily meant ''woman'', highborn or not; this is still the case in Danish, with the modern spelling ''kvinde'', as well as in Swedish ''kvinna''). The word ''[[gynaecology]]'' is also derived from the Ancient Greek cognate γυνή ''gynē'', woman. Other English words traceable to the same Indo-European root include ''[[banshee]]'' "fairy woman" (from Irish ''bean'' "woman" and ''sí'' "fairy") and ''[[zenana]]'' (from Persian زن ''zan'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/34/Q0023400.html queen] - The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000. ''Bartleby.com''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Latin ''fēmina'', whence ''female'', is likely from the root in ''fellāre'' (to suck), in reference to [[breastfeeding]].

[[File:Venus symbol.svg|thumb|right|100px|]]
===Biological symbol===

The symbol for the planet [[Venus]] is the sign also used in biology for the female sex. It is a stylized representation of the goddess Venus's hand-[[mirror]] or an abstract symbol for the goddess: a circle with a small equilateral cross underneath. The Venus symbol also represented [[femininity]], and in ancient alchemy stood for [[copper]]. Alchemists constructed the symbol from a circle (representing [[spirit]]) above an equilateral cross (representing [[matter]]).

==Terminology==
{{Further|girl|virgin|mother|wife|goodwife|lady|maid|maiden|widow|}}
'''Womanhood''' is the period in a female's life after she has passed through childhood and adolescence, generally around the age 18. 

[[File:Venus botticelli detail.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Aphrodite]]'', a classical image of youthful female [[beauty]] in [[Western art]].]]&lt;!-- as is Michelangelo's David in the Man article --&gt;

The word ''woman'' can be used generally, to mean any female human, or specifically, to mean an adult female human as contrasted with ''girl''. The word ''girl'' originally meant "young person of either sex" in English;&lt;ref&gt;Used in Middle English from c. 1300, meaning ‘a child of either sex, a young person’.  Its derivation is uncertain, perhaps from an Old English word which has not survived: another theory is that it developed from Old English ‘gyrela’, meaning ‘dress, apparel’: or was a diminutive form of a borrowing from another West Germanic Language. (Middle Low German has Gör, Göre, meaning ‘girl or small child’.)  "girl, n.". OED Online. September 2013. Oxford University Press. 13 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; it was only around the beginning of the 16th century that it came to mean specifically a ''female'' [[child]].&lt;ref&gt;By late 14th century a distinction was arising between female children, often called  ‘gay girls’ – and male, or ‘knave girls’ -: a1375   William of Palerne  (1867) l. 816  ‘ Whan þe gaye gerles were in-to þe gardin come, Faire floures þei founde.’ (‘When the gay girls came into the garden, Fair flowers they found.’) By the 16th century the unsupported word had begun to mean specifically a female:  1546   J. Heywood Dialogue Prouerbes Eng. Tongue i. x. sig. D,   ‘The boy thy husbande, and thou the gyrle his wyfe.’  The usage meaning ‘child of either sex’ survived much longer in [[Hiberno-English|Irish English]]. "girl, n.". OED Online. September 2013. Oxford University Press. 13 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''girl'' is sometimes  used colloquially to refer to a young or unmarried woman, however during the early 1970s feminists challenged such use because the use of the word to refer to a fully grown woman may cause offence. In particular, previously common terms such as ''office girl'' are no longer widely used. Conversely, in certain cultures which link family [[honor]] with female [[virginity]], the word ''girl'' is still used to refer to a never-married woman; in this sense it is used in a fashion roughly analogous to the obsolete English ''maid'' or ''maiden''. Referring to an unmarried female human as a ''woman'' may, in such a culture, imply that she is sexually experienced, which would be an insult to her family.

There are various words used to refer to the quality of being a woman. The term "womanhood" merely means the state of being a woman, having passed the [[menarche]]; "femininity" is used to refer to a set of typical female qualities associated with a certain attitude to [[gender role]]s; "womanliness" is like "femininity", but is usually associated with a different view of gender roles; "femaleness" is a general term, but is often used as shorthand for "human femaleness"; "distaff" is an archaic adjective derived from women's conventional role as a spinner, now used only as a deliberate [[archaism]]; "muliebrity" is a [[neologism]] (derived from the Latin) meant to provide a female counterpart of "[[virility]]", but used very loosely, sometimes to mean merely "womanhood", sometimes "femininity" and sometimes even as a collective term for women.

Menarche, the onset of [[menstruation]], occurs on average at age 12-13. Many cultures have [[rites of passage]] to symbolize a girl's [[coming of age]], such as confirmation in some branches of [[Christianity]], [[bat mitzvah]] in [[Judaism]], or even just the custom of a special celebration for a certain [[birthday]] (generally between 12 and 21), like the [[Quinceañera]] of Latin America.

==Biology and gender==
[[Image:Scheme female reproductive system-en.svg|thumb|right|The human female [[reproductive system]].]]
[[Image:Sky spectral karyotype.png|right|thumb|[[Spectral karyotype]] of a human female.]]

In terms of [[biology]], the female [[sex organ]]s are involved in the reproductive system, whereas the [[secondary sex characteristic]]s are involved in nurturing children or, in some cultures, attracting a mate. The [[ovaries]], in addition to their regulatory function producing hormones, produce female gametes called [[ovum|eggs]] which, when [[fertilization|fertilized]] by male gametes ([[spermatozoon|sperm]]), form new genetic individuals. The [[uterus]] is an organ with tissue to protect and nurture the developing fetus and muscle to expel it when giving birth. The [[vagina]] is used in copulation and birthing (although the word [[vagina]] is often colloquially and incorrectly used for the [[vulva]] or external female genitalia, which also includes the [[labia (genitalia)|labia]], the [[clitoris]], and the female [[urethra]]). The [[breast]] evolved from the sweat gland to produce milk, a nutritious secretion that is the most distinctive characteristic of mammals, along with live [[birth]]. In mature women, the breast is generally more prominent than in most other mammals; this prominence, not necessary for milk production, is probably at least partially the result of [[sexual selection]]. (For other ways in which men commonly differ physically from women, see [[Man#Biology and gender|man]].)

During early fetal development, embryos of both sexes appear gender-neutral. As in cases without two sexes, such as species that [[Asexual reproduction|reproduce asexually]], the gender-neutral appearance is closer to female than to male. A fetus usually develops into a male if it is exposed to a significant amount of [[testosterone]] (typically because the fetus has a Y chromosome from the father). Otherwise, the fetus usually develops into a female, typically when the fetus has an X chromosome from the father, but also when the father contributed neither an X nor Y chromosome. Later at puberty, estrogen feminizes a young woman, giving her adult sexual characteristics.

An imbalance of maternal hormonal levels and some chemicals (or drugs) may alter the secondary sexual characteristics of fetuses. Most women have the [[karyotype]] 46,XX, but around one in a thousand will be [[47,XXX]], and one in 2500 will be [[Turner syndrome|45,X]]. This contrasts with the typical male karotype of 46,XY; thus, the [[x chromosome|X]] and [[Y chromosome]]s are known as female and male, respectively. Because humans inherit mitochondrial DNA only from the mother's ovum, genetic studies of the female line tend to focus on [[Human mitochondrial genetics|mitochondrial DNA]].

Whether or not a child is a female does not always determine whether or not the child later will identify themselves that way (see [[gender identity]]). For instance, [[intersex]] individuals, who have mixed physical and/or genetic features, may use other criteria in making a clear determination. At birth, babies may be assigned a gender based on their genitalia. In some cases, even if a child had XX chromosomes, if they were born with a penis, they were raised as a male.&lt;ref&gt;{{Fausto-Sterling, Anne “Of Gender and Genitals” from Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction  of sexuality New York, NY: Basic Books, 2000, [Chapter 3, pp. 44-77]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also [[transgender]] or [[transsexual]] women, who were born or physically assigned as male at birth, but identify as women; there are varying social, legal and individual definitions with regard to these issues (see [[trans woman]]).

[[File:11-stages-womanhood-1840s.jpg|thumb|left|"The Life &amp; Age of Woman - Stages of Woman's Life from the Cradle to the Grave",1849]]
Although fewer females than males are born (the ratio is around 1:1.05), due to a longer life expectancy there are only 81 men aged 60 or over for every 100 women of the same age. Women typically have a longer life expectancy than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-is-life-expectancy-lo |title=Why is life expectancy longer for women than it is for men? |publisher=Scientific American |date=2004-08-30 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to a combination of factors: [[genetics]] (redundant and varied [[gene]]s present on [[sex chromosome]]s in women); [[sociology]] (such as not being expected in most countries to perform [[conscription|military service]]); [[health]]-impacting choices (such as [[suicide]] or the use of [[cigarette]]s, and [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]); the presence of the female hormone [[estrogen]], which has a cardioprotective effect in premenopausal women; and the effect of high levels of [[androgen]]s in men. Out of the total human population, there are 101.3 men for every 100 women (source: 2001 World Almanac).

Girls' bodies undergo gradual changes during [[puberty]]. Puberty is the process of physical changes by which a [[child]]'s [[body]] matures into an [[adult]] body capable of [[sexual reproduction]] to enable [[fertilisation]]. It is initiated by [[hormone|hormonal]] signals from the [[brain]] to the [[gonad]]s. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate [[libido]] and the growth, function, and transformation of the [[brain]], [[bone]]s, [[muscle]], [[blood]], [[skin]], [[human hair growth|hair]], [[breast]]s, and [[sex organ|sexual organs]]. [[Human development (biology)|Physical growth]]—height and weight—accelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when the child has developed an adult body. Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities, the pre-pubertal, physical differences between boys and girls are the [[Sex organ#Human genitals|genitalia]], the [[human penis|penis]] and the [[vagina]]. Puberty is a process that usually takes place between the ages 10-16, but these ages differ from girl to girl. The major landmark of girls' puberty is [[menarche]], the onset of [[menstruation]], which occurs on average between ages 12–13.&lt;ref name="Tanner"&gt;(Tanner, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="U.S. menarche"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anderson SE, Dallal GE, Must A |title=Relative weight and race influence average age at menarche: results from two nationally representative surveys of US girls studied 25 years apart |journal=Pediatrics |volume=111 |issue=4 Pt 1 |pages=844–50 |year=2003 |month=April |pmid=12671122 |doi=10.1542/peds.111.4.844}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Canadian menarche"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Age at menarche in Canada: results from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children &amp; Youth|publisher=BMC Public Health |year= 2010 |pmid=21110899 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-10-736 |pmc=3001737 |volume=10 |author=Al-Sahab B, Ardern CI, Hamadeh MJ, Tamim H |journal=BMC Public Health |pages=736}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UK menarche"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://vstudentworld.yolasite.com/resources/final_yr/gynae_obs/Hamilton%20Fairley%20Obstetrics%20and%20Gynaecology%20Lecture%20Notes%202%20Ed.pdf |title=Obstetrics and Gynaecology |first=Diana |last=Hamilton-Fairley |edition=Second|publisher=Blackwell Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lactancia bebe aire libre.jpg|thumb|Woman nursing her infant]]

Most girls go through [[menarche]] and are then able to become [[pregnant]] and [[childbirth|bear children]].&lt;ref&gt;Menarche and [[menstruation]] are absent in many of the intersex and transgender conditions mentioned above and also in [[primary amenorrhea]].&lt;/ref&gt; This generally requires internal fertilization of her eggs with the sperm of a man through [[sexual intercourse]], though [[artificial insemination]] or the surgical implantation of an existing embryo is also possible (see [[reproductive technology]]). The study of female reproduction and [[sex organ|reproductive organ]]s is called [[gynaecology]].

==Health==
{{see|Women's health|Maternal death}}
Women's health refers to health issues specific to human female anatomy. There are some diseases that primarily affect women, such as [[lupus erythematosus|lupus]]. Also, there are some [[sex-related illness]]es that are found more frequently or exclusively in women, e.g., [[breast cancer]], [[cervical cancer]], or [[ovarian cancer]]. Women and men may have different symptoms of an illness and may also respond differently to medical treatment. This area of medical research is studied by [[gender-based medicine]].

[[Maternal mortality]] or maternal death is defined by [[WHO]] as "the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/indmaternalmortality/en/&lt;/ref&gt; About 99% of maternal deaths occur in developing countries. More than half of them occur in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and almost one third in [[South Asia]]. The main causes of maternal mortality are severe bleeding (mostly bleeding after childbirth), infections (usually after childbirth), [[pre-eclampsia]] and [[eclampsia]], unsafe abortion, and pregnancy complications from [[malaria]] and [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture and gender roles==
{{Main|Gender role}}
[[Image:Weaving profile.jpg|thumb|left|A woman weaving. [[Textile]] work has historically been a female occupation in many cultures.]]

In many [[prehistory|prehistoric]] cultures, women assumed a particular cultural role. In [[hunter-gatherer]] societies, women were generally the gatherers of plant foods, small animal foods and fish, while men hunted meat from large animals.  

In more recent history, the gender roles of women have changed greatly. Traditionally, [[middle class]] women were involved in domestic tasks emphasizing child care. For poorer women, especially [[working class]] women, although this often remained an ideal,{{Specify|date=February 2007}} economic necessity compelled them to seek employment outside the home. The occupations that were available to them were, however, lower in pay than those available to men.

As changes in the labor market for women came about, availability of employment changed from only "dirty", long hour factory jobs to "cleaner", more respectable office jobs where more education was demanded, women's participation in the U.S. labor force rose from 6% in 1900 to 23% in 1923. These shifts in the labor force led to changes in the attitudes of women at work, allowing for the revolution which resulted in women becoming career and education oriented.
[[File:Millais - Das Tal der Stille.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Christian [[convent]]s in the [[Middle Ages]] provided women one alternative to married life. Throughout much of the history, marriage and religious life were the only options for a "respectable" life.]]
[[File:WomanFactory1940s.jpg|thumb|right|250px|right|During [[World War II]], women performed roles some of which would otherwise have been considered male jobs]]
In the 1970s, many academic women, including scientists, avoided having children. However, throughout the 1980s, institutions tried to equalize conditions for men and women in the workplace. However, the inequalities at home stumped women's opportunities to succeed as far as men. Professional women are still responsible for domestic labor and child care. As people would say, the have a "double burden" which does not allow then the time and energy to succeed in their careers. Furthermore, though there has been an increase in the endorsement of egalitarian gender roles in the home by both women and men, a recent research study showed that women focused on issues of morality, fairness, and well-being, while men focused on social conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Gere, J., &amp; Helwig, C. C. (2012). Young adults' attitudes and reasoning about gender oles in the family context. "Psychology of Women Quarterly, 36", 301-313. doi: [http://pwq.sagepub.com/ 10.1177/0361684312444272]&lt;/ref&gt; Until the early twentieth century, U.S. women's colleges required their women faculty members to remain single, on the grounds that a woman could not carry on two full-time professions at once. According to Schiebinger, "Being a scientist and a wife and a mother is a burden in society that expects women more often than men to put family ahead of career." (pg. 93).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science? : Science and Private Life|year=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=92–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Movements advocate [[equality of opportunity]] for both sexes and [[civil rights|equal rights]] irrespective of gender. Through a combination of [[economics|economic]] changes and the efforts of the [[feminism|feminist]] movement,{{Specify|date=May 2007}}&lt;!-- Which one? The one that occupies university departments, the movements advocating specific rights, like the Suffragettes, first wave feminism, second wave, the collection of people who identify themselves as feminists? Be clear, please. --&gt; in recent decades women in most societies now have access to careers beyond the traditional [[homemaker]]. &lt;!-- Despite these advances, modern women in Western society still face challenges in the workplace as well as with the topics of education, violence, health care, politics, and motherhood, and others. -- Clear this sentence of its vagueness before returning it to the article.--&gt; &lt;!-- [[Sexism]] can be a main concern and barrier for woman almost anywhere, though its forms, perception, and gravity varies between societies and social classes. -- This sentence can be read in so many ways there is no point in keeping it.

Although a greater number of women are seeking higher education, salaries are often less than those of men. CBS News claims that in the United States women who are ages 30 to 44 and  hold a university degree make only 62 percent of what similarly qualified men do, a lower rate than in all but three of the 19 countries for which numbers are available. Some Western nations with greater inequity in pay are Germany, New Zealand and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/09/13/national/main838207_page2.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody | work=CBS News | title=U.S. Education Slips In Rankings | date=13 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase '''violence against women''' is a [[Technical terminology|technical term]] used to collectively refer to violent acts that are primarily or exclusively committed against women.

The [[United Nations|UN]] [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women]] defines "violence against women" as:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

:"any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or mental harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life."

and identifies three forms of such violence: that occurring ''in the family'', that occurring ''within the general community'', and that perpetrated or condoned ''by the State''.


Violence against women remains a widespread problem, fueled, especially outside the West, by patriarchal social values, lack of adequate laws, and lack of enforcement of existing laws. Social norms that exist in many parts of the world hinder progress in the area of protecting women from violence. For example, according to surveys by UNICEF,  the percentage of women aged 15–49 who think that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife under certain circumstances is as high as 90% in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Jordan]], 87% in [[Mali]], 86% in [[Guinea]] and [[Timor-Leste]], 81% in [[Laos]], 80% in [[Central African Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.childinfo.org/attitudes_data.php&lt;/ref&gt;  A  2010 survey conducted by the [[Pew Research Center]] found that [[stoning]] as a punishment for [[adultery]] was supported by 82% of respondents in [[Egypt]] and [[Pakistan]], 70% in [[Jordan]], 56% [[Nigeria]], 42% in [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewglobal.org/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah/&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific forms of violence that affect women include [[female genital mutilation]], [[sex trafficking]], [[forced prostitution]], [[forced marriage]], [[rape]], [[sexual harassment]], [[honor killings]], [[acid throwing]], [[dowry death|dowry related violence]]. The State can be complicit in violence against women, for instance through practices such as [[stoning]] (as punishment for [[adultery]]).

===Literacy===
{{main|Literacy}}
World literacy is lower for females than for males. Latest data from CIA World Factbook shows that 79.7% of women are literate, compared to 88.6% of men (aged 15 and over). Literacy rates are lowest in South and West Asia, and in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===OECD countries===

====Education====
The educational [[Sex ratio|gender gap]] in [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) countries has been reduced over the last 30 years. Younger women today are far more likely to have completed a tertiary qualification: in 19 of the 30 OECD countries, more than twice as many women aged 25 to 34 have completed tertiary education than have women aged 55 to 64. In 21 of 27 OECD countries with comparable data, the number of women graduating from university-level programmes is equal to or exceeds that of men. 15-year-old girls tend to show much higher expectations for their careers than boys of the same age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/document/31/0,2340,en_2649_201185_33710751_1_1_1_1,00.html Education Levels Rising in OECD Countries but Low Attainment Still Hampers Some, [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], Publication Date: 14 September 2004]. Retrieved December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Paula Khan.jpg|thumb|A female [[biologist]] weighs a desert [[tortoise]] before release.]]
While women account for more than half of university graduates in several OECD countries, they receive only 30% of tertiary degrees granted in science and engineering fields, and women account for only 25% to 35% of researchers in most OECD countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/document/13/0,2340,en_2649_33703_37682893_1_1_1_1,00.html Women in Scientific Careers: Unleashing the Potential, [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], ISBN 92-64-02537-5, Publication Date: 20 November 2006]. Retrieved December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a common misconception that women have still not advanced in achieving academic degrees. According to Margaret Rossiter, a [[historian]] of science, women now earn 54 percent of all bachelor's degrees in the United States. However, although there are more women holding bachelors degrees than men, as the level of education increases, the more men tend to fit the statistics instead of women. At the [[Postgraduate education|graduate level]], women fill 40 percent of the [[doctorate]] degrees (31 percent of them being in engineering).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eisenhart, A. Margaret , Finkel, Elizabeth |title=Women (Still) Need Not Apply:The Gender and Science Reader|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=13–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

While to this day women are studying at prestigious universities at the same rate as men, they are not being given the same chance to join faculty. Sociologist Harriet Zuckerman has observed that the more prestigious an institute is, the more difficult and time consuming it will be for women to obtain a faculty position there. In 1989, Harvard University tenured its first woman in chemistry, Cynthia Friend, and in 1992 its first woman in physics, Melissa Franklin. She also observed that women were more likely to hold their first [[professional]] positions as instructors and lecturers while men are more likely to work first in tenure positions. According to Smith and Tang, as of 1989, 65 percent of men and only 40 percent of women held tenured positions and only 29 percent of all scientists and engineers employed as assistant professors in four-year colleges and universities were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brainard, G. Susanne, Carlin, Linda |title=A six-year Longitudinal Study of Undergraduate Women in Engineering and Science:The Gender and Science Reader|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=24–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Jobs ====
In 1992, women earned 9 percent of the Ph.D.'s awarded in [[engineering]] but only one percent made it to become a professor. In 1995, 11 percent of professors in [[science]] and engineering were women. In relation, only 311 deans of engineering schools were women, which is less than 1 percent of the total. Even in [[psychology]], a degree in which women earn the majority of Ph.D.'s, they hold a significant amount of fewer tenured positions, roughly 19 percent in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has feminism changed science ?: Meters of Equity|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge: Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women in politics==

[[File:Golda Meir 03265u.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|[[Golda Meir]]]]
Politics have been traditionally dominated by men; and women today continue to be under-represented in government in most countries. On October 2013, the global average of women in national assemblies was 21.5%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/world.htm &lt;/ref&gt;[[Suffrage]] is the civil right to [[vote]]. [[Women's suffrage in the United States]] was achieved gradually, first at state and local levels, starting in the late 19th century and early 20th century, and in 1920 women in the US received universal vote, with the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. Some Western countries were slow to allow women to vote; notably [[Switzerland]], where women gained the right to vote in federal elections in 1971, and in the canton of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] women were granted the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]];&lt;ref&gt;http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/WOM1373.doc.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Liechtenstein]], in 1984, through the [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1984]].
