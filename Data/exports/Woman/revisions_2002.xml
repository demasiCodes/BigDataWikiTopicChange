Some women are able to [[mother|bear children]]--which is the subject of [[obstetrics]]--and have [[sex]]ual characteristics that differentiates them from [[male|men]]. The subject of female reproduction and reproductive [[organ]]s is called [[gynecology]].

The general study of women at [[University|universities]] is pursued under the heading "[[women's studies]]," though, presently, that study is closely associated with [[feminism]], sometimes even [[radical feminism]]. The study of the social and economic differences between the sexes is also closely related.
