A '''woman''' is an [[adult]] [[female]] [[human|human being]], as contrasted to an adult [[male]], which is a [[man]]. The term ''woman'' (irregular [[plural]]: ''women'') is used to indicate biological [[sex]] distinctions, cultural [[gender role]] distinctions, or both.

== Sex ==

In terms of [[sex]], women have various sexual characteristics that differentiate them from [[man|men]]. In women, the [[sex organ]]s are involved in the reproductive system, whereas the [[secondary sex characteristics]] are involved in attracting a mate or nurturing children.

Although fewer females than males are born (the ratio is around 1:1.05), women make up the majority of the adult population. This is because males of all ages have a slightly higher death rate (even in the [[womb]]) and women live, on average, five years longer than men. This is thought to be a result of a combination of factors: [[genetics]] (redundant and varied [[gene]]s present on [[sex chromosome]]s in women); [[sociology]] (such as [[military service]]); [[health]]-impacting choices (such as use of [[cigarette]]s and [[alcohol]]); the presence of the female hormone [[estrogen]], which has a cardioprotective effect in premenopausal women, and the effect of high levels of [[androgen]]s in men.

After the onset of [[menarche]], most women are able to become [[pregnant]] and [[childbirth|bear children]]. (See also [[obstetrics]].) The study of female reproduction and [[sex organ|reproductive organ]]s is called [[gynecology]]. Women generally reach [[menopause]] in their late 40s or early 50s, at which point they can no longer become pregnant.

In general, women suffer from the same illnesses as men, however there are some [[sex-related illness]]es that are found more commonly or exclusively in women. 

== Gender roles ==
''Main article: [[gender role]]''

The general study of women at [[university|universities]] is pursued under the heading "[[women's studies]]". Almost since its inception, that study has been closely associated with [[feminism]] and has focused on the social and economic differences between the sexes. Current gender roles are criticised by both the [[feminism]] movement and the [[masculism]] movement.

== Terms on women ==
Whilt its definition is a female [[child]]. The term a girl is also used to refer to a young or unmarried [[woman]]. Since the early 1970s such usage has been questioned by feminists. Today, using the word in the workplace (as in "office girl") is typically considered inappropriate in the U.S., but remains commonplace in several other English speaking countries. Outside the workplace, it is also standard practice (as in "girls night out"). In this sense, "girl" may be considered the analogue to "guy" or "bloke" for a man (the latter is seldom used in the U.S.).
