----

'''Redlining''' is the practice of denying or increasing the cost of services, such as [[banking]] or 
[[insurance]], to residents of certain areas.  In the [[United States]], the practice is illegal when the
criteria are based on race, religion, or ethnic origin. The US Government has imposed regulations that require all banks to provide a map to anyone who asks showing the locations of home loans they have made (so that individuals can help ensure that redlining is not taking place). The term "redlining" comes from the practice of actually marking red lines on a map, which banks would do in order to delineate areas they did not want to lend to.
