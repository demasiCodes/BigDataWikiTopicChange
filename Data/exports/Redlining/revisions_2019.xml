In the United States '''redlining''' is the systematic denial of various services to residents of specific, often racially associated, neighborhoods or communities, either directly or through the selective raising of prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america|title=A 'Forgotten History' Of How The U.S. Government Segregated America|last=Gross|first=Terry|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harris |first1=Richard |last2=Forrester |first2=Doris |title=The Suburban Origins of Redlining: A Canadian Case Study, 1935-54 |journal=Urban Studies |date=2 July 2016 |volume=40 |issue=13 |pages=2661–2686 |doi=10.1080/0042098032000146830 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the best known examples of redlining have involved denial of financial services such as [[banking]] or [[insurance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zenou |first1=Yves |last2=Boccard |first2=Nicolas |title=Racial Discrimination and Redlining in Cities |journal=Journal of Urban Economics |date=September 2000 |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=260–285 |doi=10.1006/juec.1999.2166 }}&lt;/ref&gt; other services such as [[health care]] (see also [[Race and health]]) or even [[supermarket]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eisenhauer |first1=Elizabeth |title=In poor health: Supermarket redlining and urban nutrition |journal=GeoJournal |date=2001 |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=125–133 |doi=10.1023/A:1015772503007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have been denied to residents.

In the 1960s, sociologist John McKnight coined the term "redlining" to describe the discriminatory practice of fencing off areas where banks would avoid investments based on community demographics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultural Geography: Environments, Landscapes, Identities, Inequalities|last=Norton|first=William|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0195429541|location=|pages=}}{{page needed|date=April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the heyday of redlining, the areas most frequently discriminated against were black [[inner city]] neighborhoods. For example, in [[Atlanta]] in the 1980s, a [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning series of articles by investigative reporter [[Bill Dedman]] showed that banks would often lend to lower-income whites but not to middle-income or upper-income blacks.&lt;ref name="Color of Money"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://powerreporting.com/color/|title=The Color of Money |last=Dedman |first=Bill |date=1988-05-01 |newspaper=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[blacklist]]s is a related mechanism also used by redliners to keep track of groups, areas, and people that the discriminating party feels should be denied business or aid or other transactions. In the academic literature, redlining falls under the broader category of [[credit rationing]].

== History ==
{{Segregation}}
Although informal discrimination and segregation had existed in the United States, the specific practice called "redlining" began with the [[National Housing Act of 1934]], which established the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA).&lt;ref name = "jackson"/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/the-racist-housing-policy-that-made-your-neighborhood/371439/|title=The Racist Housing Policy That Made Your Neighborhood|last=Madrigal|first=Alexis C.|date=2014-05-22|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Racial segregation and discrimination against minorities and minority communities pre-existed this policy.  The implementation of this federal policy aggravated the decay of minority inner-city neighborhoods caused by the withholding of mortgage capital, and made it even more difficult for neighborhoods to attract and retain families able to purchase homes.&lt;ref name = "wilson"/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}} The assumptions in redlining resulted in a large increase in residential [[racial segregation]] and [[urban decay]] in the United States.

In 1935, the [[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]] (FHLBB) asked [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation]] (HOLC) to look at 239 cities and create "residential security maps" to indicate the level of security for real-estate investments in each surveyed city.  On the maps, the newest areas—those considered desirable for lending purposes—were outlined in green and known as "Type A". These were typically affluent suburbs on the outskirts of cities. "Type B" neighborhoods, outlined in blue, were considered "Still Desirable", whereas older "Type C" were labeled "Declining" and outlined in yellow.
"Type D" neighborhoods were outlined in red and were considered the most risky for mortgage support. These neighborhoods tended to be the older districts in the center of cities; often they were also [[black neighborhoods]].&lt;ref name="jackson"&gt;{{cite crabgrass}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}} Urban planning historians theorize that the maps were used by private and public entities for years afterward to deny loans to people in black communities.&lt;ref name = "jackson"/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}} But, recent research has indicated that the HOLC did not redline in its own lending activities and that the racist language reflected the bias of the private sector and experts hired to conduct the appraisals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hillier |first1=Amy |title=Redlining and the Homeowners' Loan Corporation |journal=Departmental Papers (City and Regional Planning) |date=1 May 2003 |url=https://repository.upenn.edu/cplan_papers/3/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crossney&amp;Bartelt2005a"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crossney |first1=Kristen B. |last2=Bartelt |first2=David W. |title=Residential Security, Risk, and Race: The Home Owners' Loan Corporation and Mortgage Access in Two Cities |journal=Urban Geography |date=16 May 2013 |volume=26 |issue=8 |pages=707–736 |doi=10.2747/0272-3638.26.8.707 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crossney&amp;Bartelt2005b"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crossney |first1=Kristen B. |last2=Bartelt |first2=David W. |title=The legacy of the home owners' loan corporation |journal=Housing Policy Debate |date=January 2005 |volume=16 |issue=3–4 |pages=547–574 |doi=10.1080/10511482.2005.9521555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some redlined maps were also created by private organizations, such as J.M. Brewer's 1934 map of Philadelphia.  Private organizations created maps designed to meet the requirements of the [[Federal Housing Administration]]'s underwriting manual. The lenders had to consider FHA standards if they wanted to receive FHA insurance for their loans. FHA appraisal manuals instructed banks to steer clear of areas with "inharmonious racial groups", and recommended that municipalities enact racially restrictive zoning ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;''Principles to Guide Housing Policy at the Beginning of the Millennium'', Michael Schill &amp; Susan Wachter, Cityscape&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url=http://wbhsi.net/~wendyplotkin/DeedsWeb/fha38.html |quote=Recommended restrictions should include provision for the following: Prohibition of the occupancy of properties '''except by the race for which they are intended''' ...

Following a [[National Housing Conference]] in 1973, a group of Chicago community organizations led by The Northwest Community Organization (NCO) formed [[National People's Action]] (NPA), to broaden the fight against disinvestment and mortgage redlining in neighborhoods all over the country. This organization, led by Chicago housewife [[Gale Cincotta]] and [[Shel Trapp]], a professional community organizer, targeted The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the governing authority over federally chartered Savings &amp; Loan institutions (S&amp;L) that held at that time the bulk of the country's home mortgages. NPA embarked on an effort to build a national coalition of urban community organizations to pass a national disclosure regulation or law to require banks to reveal their lending patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hallahan|first=Kirk|title=THE MORTGAGE REDLINING CONTROVERSY, 1972–1975|url=http://lamar.colostate.edu/~pr/redlining.pdf|publisher=Qualitative Studies Division, Association in Journalism and Mass Communication, Montreal August 1992|accessdate=12 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809022759/http://lamar.colostate.edu/~pr/redlining.pdf|archivedate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, urban community organizations had battled neighborhood decay by attacking [[blockbusting]], forcing landlords to maintain properties, and requiring cities to board up and tear down abandoned properties. These actions addressed the short-term issues of neighborhood decline. Neighborhood leaders began to learn that these issues and conditions were symptoms of a disinvestment that was the true, though hidden, underlying cause of these problems. They changed their strategy as more data was gathered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Michael Westgate and Ann Vick-Westgate|title=Gale Force, The Battles for Disclosure and Community Reinvestment|year=2011|publisher=Harvard Bookstore|location=Cambridge, Ma.|isbn=978-0615449012|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the help of NPA, a coalition of loosely affiliated community organizations began to form. At the Third Annual Housing Conference held in Chicago in 1974, eight hundred delegates representing 25 states and 35 cities attended. The strategy focused on the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB), which oversaw S&amp;Ls in cities all over the country.

In 1974, Chicago's Metropolitan Area Housing Association (MAHA), made up of representatives of local organizations, succeeded in having the Illinois State Legislature pass laws mandating disclosure and outlawing redlining. In Massachusetts, organizers allied with NPA confronted a unique situation. Over 90% of home mortgages were held by state-chartered savings banks. A Jamaica Plain neighborhood organization pushed the disinvestment issue into the statewide gubernatorial race. The Jamaica Plain Banking &amp; Mortgage Committee and its citywide affiliate, The Boston Anti-redlining Coalition (BARC), won a commitment from Democratic candidate [[Michael S. Dukakis]] to order statewide disclosure through the Massachusetts State Banking Commission. After Dukakis was elected, his new Banking Commissioner ordered banks to disclose mortgage-lending patterns by ZIP code. The suspected redlining was revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jordan|first=Patricia|title=Mass Thrifts Plan Suit Over Redlining, Commissioner Stands Firm|journal=American Banker|date=June 12, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;A former community organizer, Richard W. "Rick" Wise who led the Boston organizing, has published a novel, Redlined, which gives a somewhat fictionalized account of the anti-redlining campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wise |first1=Richard W. |title=Redlined; a novel of Boston |date=1 October 2019 |publisher=Adelaide Books |location=New York |isbn=978-1950437245 |pages=335 |edition=1st. |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1950437248/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NPA and its affiliates achieved disclosure of lending practices with the passage of The [[Home Mortgage Disclosure Act]] of 1975. The required transparency and review of loan practices began to change lending practices. NPA began to work on reinvestment in areas that had been neglected. Their support helped gain passage in 1977 of the [[Community Reinvestment Act]].

=== Legislative action ===
In the United States, the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]] was passed to fight the practice. According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development "The ''Fair Housing Act'' makes it unlawful to discriminate in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale of a dwelling because of race or national origin. The Act also makes it unlawful for any person or other entity whose business includes residential real estate-related transactions to discriminate against any person in making available such a transaction, or in the terms or conditions of such a transaction, because of race or national origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = HUDNo_15-064|url = http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/press/press_releases_media_advisories/2015/HUDNo_15-064b|website = portal.hud.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-04|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150905061813/http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fpress%2Fpress_releases_media_advisories%2F2015%2FHUDNo_15-064b|archivedate = 2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] was tasked with administering and enforcing this law.

One of these organizations was SACCC ([[South Austin Coalition Community Council]]), formed to restore South Austin's neighborhood and to fight against financial institutions accused of propagating redlining. This got the attention of insurance regulators in the Illinois Department of Insurance,  as well as federal officers enforcing anti-racial discrimination laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1981/02/14/page/S8/article/combatting-redlining-in-austin|title=Combatting redlining in Austin (February 14, 1981)|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current issues==

=== Racial segregation in American cities ===
{{Main|African-American neighborhood}}

The United States Federal Government has enacted legislation since the 1970s to reduce the segregation of American cities. While many cities have reduced the amount of segregated neighborhoods, some still have clearly defined racial boundaries. Since 1990, the City of [[Chicago]] has been one of the most persistently racially segregated cities, despite efforts to improve mobility and reduce barriers. Other cities like [[Detroit]], [[Houston]], and [[Atlanta]] likewise have very pronounced black and white neighborhoods, the same neighborhoods that were originally redlined by financial institutions decades ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/segregation-us-cities/?noredirect=on |title=America is more diverse than ever — but still segregated |last1=Williams |first1=Aaron |last2=Emamdjomeh |first2=Armand |date=2018 |website=The Washington Post |access-date=2019-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; While other cities have made progress, this continued racial segregation has contributed to reduced [[economic mobility]] for millions of people.

The practice of redlining actively helped to create what is now known as the [[Racial inequality in the United States#Racial wealth gap|Black - White wealth gap]] seen in the United States today.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/reports/2018/02/21/447051/systematic-inequality/|title=Systematic Inequality|last=Hanks|first=Angela|last2=Solomon|first2=Danyelle|website=Center for American Progress|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-17|last3=Weller|first3=Christian E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wealth]] is what provides/allows opportunity for the American Family.   A family can survive on an [[income]] alone but wealth is what provides for economic mobility, financial security, and inheritance.  This primary difference is what works to set apart people of color (in particular black Americans) and affluent white Americans.  Unfortunately, wealth is unevenly distributed on a basis of race, a process then can be traced back to times of slavery, allowing whites to profit off bodies of an enslaved people, who were not allowed to live freely or build wealth. Other laws and policies may have also contributed to the Black - White wealth gap including Jim crow, [[Prison–industrial complex|prison-industrial complex]] and mass incarceration, which prohibited people of color from having the same liberties as their white counterparts.

Studies show that Black families in America earn just $57.30 for every $100 in income earned by white families, according to the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey. For every $100 in white family wealth, black families hold just $5.04.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/18/upshot/black-white-wealth-gap-perceptions.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/18/upshot/black-white-wealth-gap-perceptions.html|title=Whites Have Huge Wealth Edge Over Blacks (but Don't Know It)|last=Badger|first=Emily|date=2017-09-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-12-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the median wealth for black and Hispanic families was $17,600 and $20,700, respectively, compared with white families' median wealth of $171,000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The black-white wealth gap has not recovered from the Great Recession. In 2007, immediately before the Great Recession, the median wealth of blacks was nearly 14 percent that of whites. Although black wealth increased at a faster rate than white wealth in 2016, blacks still owned less than 10 percent of whites' wealth at the median.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A multigenerational study of people from five race groups analyized upward mobility trends in American Cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Chetty |first1=Raj |last2=Hendren |first2=Nathaniel| last3=Jones | first3=Maggie |last4=Porter |first4=Sonya |date=2018 |title=Race and Economic Opportunity in the United States: An Intergenerational Perspective |url=https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/race_paper.pdf |publisher=Opportunity Insights |access-date=2019-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded that black men who grew up in racially segregated neighborhoods were substantially less likely to gain upward economic mobility, finding " black children born to parents in the bottom household income quintile have a 2.5% chance of rising to the top quintile of household income, compared with 10.6% for whites." Because of this inter generational poverty, black households are "stuck in place" and are unable to grow wealth.

A 2017 study by Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago economists found that the practice of redlining—the practice whereby banks discriminated against the inhabitants of certain neighborhoods—had a persistent adverse impact on the neighborhoods, with redlining affecting homeownership rates, home values and credit scores in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2017/wp2017-12|title=The Effects of the 1930s HOLC "Redlining" Maps - Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|website=www.chicagofed.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/upshot/how-redlinings-racist-effects-lasted-for-decades.html|title=How Redlining's Racist Effects Lasted for Decades|last=Badger|first=Emily|date=2017-08-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-26|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since many African-Americans could not access conventional home loans, they had to turn to predatory lenders (who charged high interest rates).&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Due to lower home ownership rates, slumlords were able to rent out apartments that would otherwise be owned.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

'''Asian Americans''' also experienced redlining, but unlike black Americans they have come to have  the highest homeownership rates of any single minority group since the 1970s. Their share of national homeownership is now even with their share of the overall U.S. population — despite the fact that so many live in coastal cities where renting is popular." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennawang/2018/05/31/asian-americans-post-largest-gains-in-homeownership/#12b88b494a64 |title = Asian Americans Post Largest Gains in Homeownership}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retail ===

==== Brick and mortar ====
[[Retail]] redlining is a spatially discriminatory practice among retailers. Taxicab services and delivery food may not serve certain areas, based on their ethnic-minority composition and assumptions about business (and perceived crime), rather than data and economic criteria, such as the potential profitability of operating in those areas. Consequently, consumers in these areas are vulnerable to prices set by fewer retailers. They may be exploited by retailers who charge higher prices and/or offer them inferior goods. Critics, however, argue that if such practices were causing retailers to avoid doing business in otherwise profitable areas (due to the racial demographics of these locations), retailers who avoided this practice and continued to do business in these areas would be at an economic advantage over their competition. Therefore, by choosing not to service a potentially profitable area, retailers would be lowering the quantity supplied of their good or service to below the market equilibrium quantity. This would allow any businesses that stayed in the area to make an economic profit. The presence of economic profits for retailers in that area would create a strong market incentive for new firms to move into this area. Because of these economic incentives, critics argue that the businesses discriminating based on race when choosing their customers were doing so for economic reasons in order to maximize their profits. If these businesses were avoiding potentially profitable areas, new businesses would quickly take advantage of the resulting presence of economic profits and decreased competition in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Denver D'Rozario, "Retail Redlining: Definition, Theory, Typology, and Measurement", ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 25, No. 2, 175–186 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study by the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' found that [[Staples Inc.|Staples]], [[Home Depot]], [[Rosetta Stone (software)|Rosetta Stone]] and some other online retailers displayed different prices to customers in different locations (distinct from shipping prices).  Staples based discounts on proximity to competitors like [[OfficeMax]] and [[Office Depot]].

==== Liquorlining ====
Some service providers target low-income neighborhoods for nuisance sales. When those services are believed to have adverse effects on a community, they may considered to be a form of "reverse redlining."  The term "liquorlining" is sometimes used to describe high densities of liquor stores in low income and/or minority communities relative to surrounding areas. High densities of liquor stores are associated with crime and public health issues, which may in turn drive away supermarkets, grocery stores, and other retail outlets, contributing to low levels of economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://woodstockinst.org/document/liquorlining.pdf |title=Liquorlining: Liquor Store Concentration and Community Development in Lower-income Cook County Neighborhoods |last1=Maxwell |first1=Ann |last2=Daniel |first2=Immergluck |date=January 1997 |website=Woodstock Institute |access-date=14 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416121921/http://woodstockinst.org/document/liquorlining.pdf |archivedate=16 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Controlled for income, nonwhites face higher concentrations of liquor stores than do whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Romley |first1=John A. |last2=Cohen |first2=Deborah |last3=Ringel |first3=Jeanne |last4=Sturm |first4=Roland |display-authors=2 |last-author-amp= |editor-last=Schuckit |editor1-first=Mark A. |date=January 2007 |title=Alcohol and Environmental Justice:The Density of Liquor Stores and Bars in Urban Neighborhoods in the United States |url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/reprints/2008/RAND_RP1323.pdf |journal=Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=48–55  |access-date=14 March 2015 |via=[[RAND Corporation]]|doi=10.15288/jsad.2007.68.48 |pmid=17149517 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial services===

==== Student loans ====
In December 2007, a [[class action]] [[lawsuit]] was brought against student loan lending giant [[Sallie Mae]] in the [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut]]. The class alleged that Sallie Mae discriminated against African American and [[Hispanic]] private student loan applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newamerica.net/files/sallie%20mae%20lawsuit.pdf |title=Sasha Rodriguez &amp; Cathelyn Gregoire on Behalf of All Persons Similarly Situated vs. Sallie Mae (SLM) Corporation |publisher=New America Foundation |date=December 17, 2007 |accessdate=March 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006133740/http://www.newamerica.net/files/sallie%20mae%20lawsuit.pdf |archive-date=2014-10-06 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case alleged that the factors Sallie Mae used to [[Underwriting|underwrite]] [[private student loans]] caused a [[disparate impact]] on students attending schools with higher minority populations. The suit also alleged that Sallie Mae failed to properly disclose loan terms to private student loan borrowers.

The lawsuit was settled in 2011. The terms of the settlement included Sallie Mae agreeing to make a $500,000 donation to the [[United Negro College Fund]] and the attorneys for the plaintiffs receiving $1.8 million in attorneys' fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ecf.ctd.uscourts.gov/doc1/04113074545 |title=SDSD District Version 1.3 |publisher=United States District Court for the District of Connecticut |date= |accessdate=July 25, 2014}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Credit cards ====
[[Credit card]] redlining is a spatially discriminatory practice among credit card issuers, of providing different amounts of [[Credit score in the United States|credit]] to different areas, based on their ethnic-minority composition, rather than on economic criteria, such as the potential profitability of operating in those areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1098403 |title=Credit Card Redlining |year=2009 |last1=Cohen-Cole |first1=Ethan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars assess certain policies, such as credit card issuers reducing credit lines of individuals with a record of purchases at retailers frequented by so-called "high-risk" customers, to be akin to redlining.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==== Banks ====
Much of the economic impacts we find as a result of redlining and the banking system directly impacts that of the African American / Black Community. Beginning in the 1960s, there was a large influx of Black [[Veteran]]s and their families moving into suburban White communities. As Blacks moved in, Whites moved out and the market value of these homes dropped dramatically.  In observation of said market values, bank lenders were able to keep close track by literally drawing red lines around the neighborhoods on a map. These lines signified areas that they would not invest in. By way of racial redlining, not only banks but savings and loans, insurance companies, grocery chains, and even pizza delivery companies thwarts economic vitality in black communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uwosh.edu/sirt/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2017/08/Bullard_Environmental-Justice-in-the-21st-Century.pdf|title=Environmental Justice in The 21st Century|last=Bullard|first=Robert D|date=2008|website=uwosh.edu|access-date=2018-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The severe lacking in civil rights laws in combination with the economic impact led to the passing of the [[Community Reinvestment Act]] in 1977.

Racial and economic redlining sets the people who lived in these communities up for failure from the start. So much that banks would often deny people who came from these areas bank loans or offered them at stricter repayment rates. As a result, there was a very low rate at which people (in particular Blacks / African Americans) were able to own their homes; opening the door for [[Slumlord|slum landlords]] (who could get approved for low interest loans in those communities) to take over and do as they saw fit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=Stephen|date=2000|title=Redlining, the Community Reinvestment Act, and Private Mortgage Insurance|journal=Urban Economics|volume=|pages=|citeseerx=10.1.1.194.5280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Insurance ====
Gregory D. Squires wrote in 2003 that data showed that race continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry.&lt;ref name="Squires2016"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-9906.t01-1-00168 |title=Racial Profiling, Insurance Style: Insurance Redlining and the Uneven Development of Metropolitan Areas |journal=Journal of Urban Affairs |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=391–410 |year=2016 |last1=Squires |first1=Gregory D }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Racial profiling]] or redlining has a long history in the property-insurance industry in the United States. From a review of industry underwriting and marketing materials, court documents, and research by government agencies, industry and community groups, and academics, it is clear that race has long affected and continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry.&lt;ref name="Squires2016" /&gt; Home-insurance agents may try to assess the ethnicity of a potential customer just by telephone, affecting what services they offer to inquiries about purchasing a home insurance policy. This type of discrimination is called [[Linguistic Profiling|linguistic profiling]].&lt;ref name="SquiresChadwick2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1078087405281064 |title=Linguistic Profiling |journal=Urban Affairs Review |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=400–15 |year=2016 |last1=Squires |first1=Gregory D |last2=Chadwick |first2=Jan }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been concerns raised about redlining in the [[car insurance|automotive insurance]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itd.idaho.gov/transporter/2003/080803_Trans/080803_MIuninsured.html Karen Bouffard, "Michigan to crack down on uninsured drivers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128033237/http://www.itd.idaho.gov/transporter/2003/080803_Trans/080803_MIuninsured.html |date=2007-11-28 }}, ''[[The Detroit News]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews of [[insurance score]]s based on credit are shown to have unequal results by ethnic group. The Ohio Department of Insurance in the early 21st century allows insurance providers to use maps and collection of demographic data by ZIP code in determining insurance rates. The FHEO Director of Investigations at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Sara Pratt, wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like other forms of discrimination, the history of insurance redlining began in conscious, overt racial discrimination practiced openly and with significant community support in communities throughout the country. There was documented overt discrimination in practices relating to residential housing—from the appraisal manuals which established an articulated "policy" of preferences based on race, religion and national origin. to lending practices which only made loans available in certain parts of town or to certain borrowers, to the decision-making process in loans and insurance which allowed the insertion of discriminatory assessments into final decisions about either.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fairhousing.com/resources/history-insurance-redlining|title=The History of Insurance Redlining {{!}} National Fair Housing Advocate Online|website=fairhousing.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Mortgages ====
'''Reverse redlining''' occurs when a lender or insurer particularly targets minority consumers, not to deny them loans or insurance, but to charge them more than would be charged to a similarly situated white consumer, specifically marketing the most expensive and onerous loan products. These communities had [[Mortgage discrimination|largely been ignored by most lenders]] just a couple of decades earlier. In the 2000s some financial institutions considered black communities as suitable for subprime mortgages. [[Wells Fargo]] partnered with churches in black communities, where the pastor would deliver "wealth building" seminars in their sermons, and the bank would make a donation to the church in return for every new mortgage application. Working-class blacks wanted a part of the nation's home-owning trend. Instead of contributing to homeownership and community progress, predatory lending practices through reverse redlining stripped the equity homeowners struggled to build and drained the wealth of those communities for the enrichment of [[Financial institution|financial firms]]. The growth of [[subprime lending]] (higher cost loans to borrowers with flaws on their credit records) prior to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 financial crisis]], coupled with growing law enforcement activity in those areas, clearly showed a surge in a range of manipulative practices. Not all subprime loans were predatory, but virtually all [[Predatory lending|predatory loans]] were subprime. Some subprime loans certainly benefit high-risk borrowers who would not qualify for conventional, [[prime loan]]s. Predatory loans, however, charge unreasonably higher rates and fees by compared to the risk, trapping homeowners in unaffordable debt and often costing them their homes and life savings.&lt;ref name="The Recession's Racial Divide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell"/&gt;

A survey of two districts of similar incomes, one being largely white and the other largely black, found that bank branches in the black community offered largely subprime loans and almost no prime loans. Studies found out that high-income blacks were almost twice as likely to end up with subprime home-purchase mortgages as did low-income whites. Some loan officers referred to blacks as "mud people" and to subprime lending as "ghetto loans."&lt;ref name="The Recession's Racial Divide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/minority-families-face-wave-of-foreclosures |title=Minority families face wave of foreclosures: Consumer groups urge more 'teeth' in laws combating predators |first=Ruth |last=Mantell |date=July 6, 2007 |accessdate=December 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lower savings rate and a distrust of banks, stemming from a legacy of redlining, may help explain why there are fewer branches in minority neighborhoods. In the early 21st century, brokers and telemarketers actively pushed subprime mortgages. A majority of the loans were refinance transactions, allowing homeowners to take cash out of their appreciating property or pay off credit card and other debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/weekinreview/04bajaj.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Vikas | last1=Bajaj | first2=Ford | last2=Fessenden | title=What's Behind the Race Gap? |date=November 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redlining has helped preserve [[Housing segregation in the United States|segregated]] living patterns for blacks and whites in the United States, as discrimination is often contingent on the racial composition of neighborhoods and the race of the applicant. Lending institutions such as [[Wells Fargo]] have been shown to treat black mortgage applicants differently when they are buying homes in white neighborhoods than when buying homes in black neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="The Recession's Racial Divide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen R Holloway (1998), "Exploring the Neighborhood Contingency of Race Discrimination in Mortgage Lending in Columbus, Ohio", ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', 88 (2), 252–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan Immergluck writes that in 2002 small businesses in black neighborhoods received fewer loans, even after accounting for business density, business size, industrial mix, neighborhood income, and the credit quality of local businesses.&lt;ref&gt;"Redlining Redux", ''Urban Affairs Review,'' Vol. 38, No. 1, 22–41 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Several state attorneys general have begun investigating these practices, which may violate fair lending laws. The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] filed a class-action lawsuit charging systematic racial discrimination by more than a dozen banks.

=== Environmental racism ===
{{Main|Environmental racism}}
{{See also|Race and health}}
Policies related to redlining and [[urban decay]] can also act as a form of [[environmental racism]], which in turn affect public health. Urban minority communities may face environmental racism in the form of parks that are smaller, less accessible and of poorer quality than those in more affluent or white areas in some cities.&lt;ref name="parks"&gt;''[http://www.berkeleydaily.org/text/article.cfm?issue=11-13-07&amp;storyID=28458 Minority Communities Need More Parks, Report Says]'' by Angela Rowen ''The Berkeley Daily Planet''&lt;/ref&gt; This may have an indirect effect on health, since young people have fewer places to play, and adults have fewer opportunities for exercise.&lt;ref name="parks" /&gt;

Robert Wallace writes that the pattern of the [[AIDS]] outbreak during the 80s was affected by the outcomes of a program of "[[planned shrinkage]]" directed at African-American and Hispanic communities. It was implemented through systematic denial of municipal services, particularly fire protection resources, essential to maintain urban levels of population density and ensure community stability.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, R. "Urban desertification, public health and public order: 'planned shrinkage', violent death, substance abuse and AIDS in the Bronx." ''Soc Sci Med,'' 1990 – ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/ref&gt; [[Institutionalized racism]] affects general health care as well as the quality of AIDS health intervention and services in minority communities. The over-representation of minorities in various disease categories, including AIDS, is partially related to environmental racism. The national response to the AIDS epidemic in minority communities was slow during the 80s and 90s, showing an insensitivity to ethnic diversity in prevention efforts and AIDS health services.&lt;ref&gt;"AIDS and racism in America."

For example, in March 2019 the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) charged Facebook with housing discrimination over the company's targeted advertising practices.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_19_035|title=HUD Charges Facebook With Housing Discrimination Over Company's Targeted Advertising Practices|date=2019-03-28|website=www.hud.gov|access-date=2019-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these charges included geographically based targeting in the form of a tool that allowed advertisers to draw a red line on a map; they also included non-geographically based methods that did not use maps but rather utilized algorithmic targeting using Facebook's user profile information to directly exclude specific groups of people. A press release from HUD on March 28, 2019 stated that HUD was charging that "Facebook enabled advertisers to exclude people whom Facebook classified as parents; non-American-born; non-Christian; interested in accessibility; interested in Hispanic culture; or a wide variety of other interests that closely align with the Fair Housing Act’s protected classes."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Political Redlining ===

Political redlining is the process of restricting the supply of political information with assumptions about demographics and present or past opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=New Media Campaigns and the Managed Citizen |last=Howard |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip N.

It can also occur when politicians, lobbyists, or political campaign managers identify which communities to actively discourage from voting through [[voter suppression]] campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/12/16/new-report-russian-disinformation-prepared-senate-shows-operations-scale-sweep/ |title=New report on Russian disinformation, prepared for the Senate, shows the operation’s scale and sweep |last1=Timberg |first1=Craig |last2=Romm |first2=Tony |date=2018 |website=The Washington Post |access-date=2019-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/trumps-black-voter-dilemma/505586/ |title=Trump's 'Voter Suppression Operation' Targets Black Voters |last1=Graham |first1=David |date=2016 |website=The Atlantic |access-date=2019-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategies to reverse effects of redlining ==

Redlining has contributed to the long term decline of low-income, [[inner city]] neighborhoods and the continuation of ethnic minority [[ethnic enclaves|enclaves]]. Compared to prospering ethnic minority areas, historically redlined or other struggling black communities need targeted investments in infrastructure and services in order to prosper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Height |first=Tatiana |date=2017 |title=Analyzing Communities in Black America: How Urban and Regional Planners Can Plan for Prosperous Black Communities |type=Thesis |publisher=University of Nebraska-Lincoln |pages=57-63 |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/arch_crp_theses/47 |access-date=2019-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these strategies include:
* Targeting planning resources to improve employment, incomes, wealth, the built environment, and social services in struggling communities. 
* Recognize the importance of [[public transportation]] as a means for low-income communities to access jobs and services. 
* Provide jobs near the labor supply through targeted [[economic development]]. 
* Invest in the housing stock through neighborhood revitalization programs.
* Utilize [[Inclusionary zoning]] (IZ) ordinances to improve amounts of high quality housing. 
* Equitably distribute [[hazardous waste]] sites so they are not concentrated in low-income and minority areas.

=== History ===
Redlining has a multiplicity of effects on the way our systems are set up today. Financial implications, benefits and public safety regulations impact the way that people who live in the "Hood", (often people of color) have come to relate to themselves and society.  Hood Culture is reflective of the ways people of color have come to survive due to the impacts of redlining. They have had to become an adaptive people in order to make a livelihood for themselves and their families. Redlining, through years of [[systematic oppression]], [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]] and segregative practices has destabilized communities, due to them not being provided much to better their own economic mobility. Researchers and [[Economist]] throughout the years have questioned if these maps actually influenced the development of urban neighborhoods (aka "the Hood") over the course of the 20th century to now. &lt;blockquote&gt;The economists now believe that appraisers ... weren't merely identifying disparities that already existed in the 1930s, and that were likely to worsen anyway. The lines they helped draw, based in large part on the belief that the presence of blacks and other minorities would undermine property values, altered what would happen in these communities for years to come. Maps alone didn't create segregated and unequal cities today. But the role they played was pivotal. The maps became self-fulfilling prophesies, as "hazardous" neighborhoods — "redlined" ones — were starved of investment and deteriorated further in ways that most likely also fed [[white flight]] and rising racial segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Church |first1=Jennifer |title=Perceptions versus interpretations, and domains for self-fulfilling prophesies |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |date=22 March 2017 |volume=40 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X15002320 |pmid=28327215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Present Day ===
Hood culture is typically seen in a negative light; one consistent with drugs, poverty, single parent households, oversized families, violence, immigration,  prostitution, overcrowding, scarcity, survival, territory, and gangs. However, all of these things operating out of redlined communities is not by happenstance. Something important to note is the cycle of redlining. Active racism and segregation help to funnel many of these things into these communities. Early studies surrounding the crack cocaine epidemic show that there was a large influx of crack cocaine in impoverished neighborhoods while pure cocaine revolves largely in more affluent neighborhoods (being that it is more expensive than crack). However, possession and distribution of crack cocaine has a longer jail sentence and penalty than that of powdered cocaine. With crack cocaine being a popular choice within communities of color, minorities are incarcerated at longer rates for crack cocaine than those who are found in possession of pure cocaine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Alana |last2=Groves |first2=Allison K. |last3=Blankenship |first3=Kim M. |title=Comparing Black and White Drug Offenders |journal=Journal of Drug Issues |date=21 December 2016 |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=132–142 |doi=10.1177/0022042616678614 |pmc=5614457 |pmid=28966392 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, we note the same effect in health care. Geographically speaking, there are an overage of liquor stores and fast food stores in these hoods as opposed to the healthier choice options found in affluent communities. There is also a shortage of doctors office, farmers markets and hospitals. These are just a few of the disparities to highlight.

Hood culture emerges out of these experiences. The culture generally being that of not trusting anyone, especially the white man. Youth learn to care for themselves in the hood and then mature into adults that raise their kids to do the same. Nevertheless, there still exist a strong sense of community building in the hood as well. With the overcrowding of apartment complexes in the hood it becomes increasingly difficult not to know your neighbor. People in the hood have a tendency to support their local [[Mom-and-pop|mom &amp; pop]] shops and entrepreneurism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Am I Black Enough For You?
