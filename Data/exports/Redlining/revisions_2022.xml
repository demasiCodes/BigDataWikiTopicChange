In the United States, '''redlining''' is a [[Discrimination|discriminatory]] practice in which services ([[Financial services|financial]] and otherwise) are withheld from potential customers who reside in neighborhoods classified as "hazardous" to [[investment]]; these neighborhoods have significant numbers of [[Race (human categorization)|racial]] and [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] minorities, and low-income residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Locke |first1=Dexter H. |last2=Hall |first2=Billy |last3=Grove |first3=J.

== History ==
The specific process termed "redlining" in the United States occurred on the background of racial segregation and discrimination against minority populations. It had its origins in sales practices of the [[National Association of Real Estate Boards]] and theories about race and property values codified by economists surrounding [[Richard T. Ely]] and his Institute for Research in Land Economics and Public Utilities, founded at the [[University of Wisconsin]] in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Winling |first1=LaDale C |last2=Michney |first2=Todd M |title=The Roots of Redlining: Academic, Governmental, and Professional Networks in the Making of the New Deal Lending Regime |journal=Journal of American History |date=1 June 2021 |volume=108 |issue=1 |pages=42–69 |doi=10.1093/jahist/jaab066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[National Housing Act of 1934]] the federal government began to be involved in the practice and the concurrent establishment of the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA).&lt;ref name="Madrigal"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/the-racist-housing-policy-that-made-your-neighborhood/371439/ |title=The Racist Housing Policy That Made Your Neighborhood |last=Madrigal |first=Alexis C. |date=22 May 2014 |work=The Atlantic |access-date=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FHA's formalized redlining process was developed by their Chief Land Economist, [[Homer Hoyt]], as part of an initiative to develop the first [[Mortgage underwriting in the United States|underwriting criteria]] for [[mortgages]].&lt;ref name="color"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rothstein |first=Richard |date=2017 |title=The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America |publisher=Liveright |pages=93–94 |isbn=978-1-63149-286-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hoytbiography"&gt;{{Citation |title=Homer Hoyt: An Introduction |date=2019-01-29 |url=http://hoytgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Homer-Hoyt-Bio-Grant-and-Steve-Final-1-29-2019.pdf |access-date=2021-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of this federal policy accelerated the decay and isolation of minority inner-city neighborhoods through withholding of mortgage capital, making it even more difficult for neighborhoods to attract and retain families able to purchase homes.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;''[[When Work Disappears]]: The World of the New Urban Poor'' By William Julius Wilson. 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-679-72417-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}} The discriminatory assumptions in redlining exacerbated residential [[racial segregation]] and [[urban decay]] in the United States.

In 1935, the [[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]] (FHLBB) asked the [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation]] (HOLC) to look at 239 cities and create "residential security maps" to indicate the level of security for real-estate investments in each surveyed city.  On the maps, the newest areas—those considered desirable for lending purposes—were outlined in green and known as "Type A". These were typically affluent suburbs on the outskirts of cities. "Type B" neighborhoods, outlined in blue, were considered "Still Desirable", whereas older "Type C" were labeled "Declining" and outlined in yellow. "Type D" neighborhoods were outlined in red and were considered the most risky for mortgage support. While about 85% of the residents of such neighborhoods were white, they included most of the [[African-American]] urban households.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Maas |first1=Steve |title=Searching for the Origins of Redlining of Black Neighborhoods |url=https://www.nber.org/digest-202102/searching-origins-redlining-black-neighborhoods |website=NBER |access-date=1 October 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; These neighborhoods tended to be the older districts in the center of cities; often they were also [[African-American neighborhood]]s.&lt;ref name="jackson"&gt;{{cite crabgrass}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}} Urban planning historians theorize that the maps were used by private and public entities for years afterward to deny loans to people in black communities.&lt;ref name = "jackson"/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}} But, recent research has indicated that the HOLC did not redline in its own lending activities and that the racist language reflected the bias of the private sector and experts hired to conduct the appraisals.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/0096144203029004002 |title=Redlining and the Home Owners' Loan Corporation |year=2003 |last1=Hillier |first1=Amy E. |journal=Journal of Urban History |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=394–420 |s2cid=18458609 |url=https://repository.upenn.edu/cplan_papers/3/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crossney&amp;Bartelt2005a"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crossney |first1=Kristen B. |last2=Bartelt |first2=David W. |title=Residential Security, Risk, and Race: The Home Owners' Loan Corporation and Mortgage Access in Two Cities |journal=Urban Geography |date=16 May 2013 |volume=26 |issue=8 |pages=707–736 |doi=10.2747/0272-3638.26.8.707 |s2cid=153649195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crossney&amp;Bartelt2005b"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crossney |first1=Kristen B. |last2=Bartelt |first2=David W. |title=The legacy of the home owners' loan corporation |journal=Housing Policy Debate |date=January 2005 |volume=16 |issue=3–4 |pages=547–574 |doi=10.1080/10511482.2005.9521555 |s2cid=154211464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redlining maps even became prominent under private organizations, such as appraiser J. M. Brewer's 1934 map of Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="BrewerMapSouth"&gt;{{cite web |title=J.M.

The lenders had to consider FHA standards if they wanted to receive FHA insurance for their loans. FHA appraisal manuals instructed banks to steer clear of areas with "inharmonious racial groups", and recommended that municipalities enact racially restrictive zoning ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor=20868512 |last1=Schill |first1=Michael H. |last2=Wachter |first2=Susan M. |title=Principles to Guide Housing Policy at the Beginning of the Millennium |journal=Cityscape |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=5–19 |year=2001 |citeseerx=10.1.1.536.5952 |s2cid=154443509}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://wbhsi.net/~wendyplotkin/DeedsWeb/fha38.html |quote=Recommended restrictions should include provision for the following: Prohibition of the occupancy of properties except by the race for which they are intended [...] Schools should be appropriate to the needs of the new community and they should not be attended in large numbers by inharmonious racial groups |publisher=[[Federal Housing Administration]] |title=Underwriting Manual: Underwriting and Valuation Procedure Under Title II of the National Housing Act With Revisions to February 1938 |location=Washington, D.C. |chapter=Part II, Section 9, Rating of Location |title-link=National Housing Act of 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1945 and 1959, African Americans received less than 2 percent of all federally insured home loans.&lt;ref name="Hanlon"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hanlon |first1=Bernadette |last2=Short |first2=John Rennie |editor1-last=Anacker |editor1-first=Katrin B. |editor2-last=Nguyen |editor2-first=Mai Thi |editor3-last=Varady |editor3-first=David P. |display-editors=1 |title=The Routledge Handbook of Housing Policy and Planning |date=2020 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-1-1381-8843-3 |chapter=Housing Policy and the Suburban Metropolis: A Focus on the United States and France}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanchett"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanchett |first=Thomas W. |chapter=The Other 'Subsidized Housing': Federal Aid to Suburbanization 1940s-1960s |editor1-first=John F. |editor1-last=Bauman |editor2-first=Roger |editor2-last=Biles |editor3-first=Kristin M. |editor3-last=Szylvian |display-editors=1 |title=From Tenements to the Taylor Homes: In Search of an Urban Housing Policy in Twentieth Century America |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |year=2000 |pages=163–179 |isbn=978-0-271-02012-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gelfand"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gelfand |first1=Mark I. |title=A Nation of Cities: The Federal Government and Urban America, 1933–1965 |date=1975 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-501941-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/nationofcitiesfe0000gelf/page/220 |page=221 |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banks and mortgage lenders were not the only private entities to develop redlining practices. Property insurance companies also  instituted rigid redlining policies in the post-World War II period. According to urban historian Bench Ansfield, the postwar advent of comprehensive homeowners' insurance was limited to the suburbs and withheld from neighborhoods of color in U.S. cities. One Aetna bulletin from 1964 advised underwriters to "use a red line around questionable areas on territorial maps." The New York Urban Coalition warned in 1978, “A neighborhood without insurance is a neighborhood doomed to death.”&lt;ref name="Journal of American History 2021"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ansfield |first1=Bench |title=The Crisis of Insurance and the Insuring of the Crisis: Riot Reinsurance and Redlining in the Aftermath of the 1960s Uprisings |journal=Journal of American History |date=1 March 2021 |volume=107 |issue=4 |pages=899–921 |doi=10.1093/jahist/jaaa533 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a [[National Housing Conference]] in 1973, a group of Chicago community organizations led by The Northwest Community Organization (NCO) formed [[National People's Action]] (NPA), to broaden the fight against disinvestment and mortgage redlining in neighborhoods all over the country. This organization, led by Chicago housewife [[Gale Cincotta]] and [[Shel Trapp]], a professional community organizer, targeted The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the governing authority over federally chartered [[Savings and loan association]]s (S&amp;L) that held at that time the bulk of the country's home mortgages. NPA embarked on an effort to build a national coalition of urban community organizations to pass a national disclosure regulation or law to require banks to reveal their lending patterns.&lt;ref name="CAKirk"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hallahan |first=Kirk |date=1992 |title=The mortgage redlining controversy, 1972-75 |language=en |oclc=31165884 |url=http://lamar.colostate.edu/~pr/redlining.pdf |journal=Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (75th, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, August 5–8, 1992) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809022759/http://lamar.colostate.edu/~pr/redlining.pdf |archive-date=2013-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, urban community organizations had battled neighborhood decay by attacking [[blockbusting]] (deceptive encouragement of [[white flight]] from neighborhoods in order to buy up real estate at a huge discount and then rent to low-income, usually black tenants), forcing landlords to maintain properties, and requiring cities to board up and tear down abandoned properties. These actions addressed the short-term issues of neighborhood decline. Neighborhood leaders began to learn that these issues and conditions were symptoms of disinvestment that was the true, though hidden, underlying cause of these problems. They changed their strategy as more data was gathered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Michael Westgate and Ann Vick-Westgate |title=Gale Force, The Battles for Disclosure and Community Reinvestment |year=2011 |publisher=Harvard Bookstore |location=Cambridge, Ma. |isbn=978-0-615-44901-2 |pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the help of NPA, a coalition of loosely affiliated community organizations began to form. At the Third Annual Housing Conference held in Chicago in 1974, eight hundred delegates representing 25 states and 35 cities attended. The strategy focused on the [[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]] (FHLBB), which oversaw S&amp;Ls in cities all over the country.

In 1974, Chicago's Metropolitan Area Housing Association (MAHA), made up of representatives of local organizations, succeeded in having the Illinois State Legislature pass laws mandating disclosure and outlawing redlining. In Massachusetts, organizers allied with NPA confronted a unique situation. Over 90% of home mortgages were held by state-chartered savings banks. A Jamaica Plain neighborhood organization pushed the disinvestment issue into the statewide gubernatorial race. The Jamaica Plain Banking &amp; Mortgage Committee and its citywide affiliate, The Boston Anti-redlining Coalition (BARC), won a commitment from Democratic candidate [[Michael S. Dukakis]] to order statewide disclosure through the Massachusetts State Banking Commission. After Dukakis was elected, his new Banking Commissioner ordered banks to disclose mortgage-lending patterns by [[ZIP Code|ZIP code]]. The suspected redlining was revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jordan |first=Patricia |title=Mass Thrifts Plan Suit Over Redlining, Commissioner Stands Firm |journal=American Banker |date=June 12, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard W. "Rick" Wise, a former community organizer who led the Boston organizing, has published a novel, ''Redlined'', which gives a somewhat fictionalized account of the anti-redlining campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wise |first1=Richard W. |title=Redlined; a novel of Boston |date=1 October 2019 |publisher=Adelaide Books |location=New York |isbn=978-1-950437-24-5 |page=335 |edition=1st }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NPA and its affiliates achieved disclosure of lending practices with the passage of The [[Home Mortgage Disclosure Act]] of 1975. The required transparency and review of loan practices began to change lending practices. NPA began to work on reinvestment in areas that had been neglected. Their support helped gain passage in 1977 of the [[Community Reinvestment Act]].

The Justice Department called it the "largest residential mortgage redlining settlement in its history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-and-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-reach-settlement-hudson-city |title=Justice Department and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Reach Settlement with Hudson City Savings Bank to Resolve Allegations of Mortgage Lending Discrimination |website=www.justice.gov |language=en |access-date=2017-03-08 |date=2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of the settlement agreement, HCSB was forced to open branches in non-white communities. As U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman explained to Emily Badger for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', "[i]f you lived in a majority-black or Hispanic neighborhood and you wanted to apply for a mortgage, Hudson City Savings Bank was not the place to go." The enforcement agencies cited additional evidence of discrimination in Hudson City's broker selection practices, noting that the bank received 80 percent of its mortgage applications from mortgage brokers but that the brokers with whom the bank worked were not located in majority African-American and Hispanic areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/09/25/what-it-looks-like-when-a-bank-structures-its-business-to-avoid-minorities/ |title=What it looks like when a bank goes out of its way to avoid minorities |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislative action ===
{{Unclear citation style|section|date=April 2021}}
In the United States, the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]] was passed to fight the practice of redlining. According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, "The ''Fair Housing Act'' makes it unlawful to discriminate in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale of a dwelling because of race or national origin. The Act also makes it unlawful for any person or other entity whose business includes residential real estate-related transactions to discriminate against any person in making available such a transaction, or in the terms or conditions of such a transaction, because of race or national origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=HUDNo_15-064 |url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/press/press_releases_media_advisories/2015/HUDNo_15-064b |website=portal.hud.gov |access-date=2015-11-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905061813/http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fpress%2Fpress_releases_media_advisories%2F2015%2FHUDNo_15-064b |archive-date=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] was tasked with administering and enforcing this law.

The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) is a United States law (codified at 15 U.S.C. § 1691 et seq.), enacted 28 October 1974,[1] that makes it unlawful for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant, with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);[2] to the fact that all or part of the applicant's income derives from a public assistance program; or to the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The law applies to any person who, in the ordinary course of business, regularly participates in a credit decision,[3] including banks, retailers, bankcard companies, finance companies, and credit unions.

The part of the law that defines its authority and scope is known as Regulation B,[4] from the (b) that appears in Title 12 part 1002's official identifier: 12 C.F.R. § 1002.1(b) (2017).[5] Failure to comply with Regulation B can subject a financial institution to civil liability for actual and punitive damages in individual or class actions. Liability for punitive damages can be as much as $10,000 in individual actions and the lesser of $500,000 or 1% of the creditor's net worth in class actions.[6]

The [[Community Reinvestment Act]], passed by Congress in 1977 required banks to apply the same lending criteria in all communities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0813339529 Comeback Cities: A Blueprint for Urban Neighborhood Revival] By Paul S.

Page 114.&lt;blockquote&gt;The goal was not to relax lending restrictions but rather to get banks to apply the same criteria to residents in the inner-city as in the [[suburbs]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1970s, community organizations, under the banner of the NPA, worked to fight against redlining in South Austin, Illinois. One of these organizations was SACCC ([[South Austin Coalition Community Council]]), formed to restore South Austin's neighborhood and to fight against financial institutions accused of propagating redlining. This got the attention of insurance regulators in the Illinois Department of Insurance, as well as federal officers enforcing anti-racial discrimination laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1981/02/14/page/S8/article/combatting-redlining-in-austin |title=Combatting redlining in Austin |date=February 14, 1981 |access-date=2017-03-16 |work=Chicago Tribune}}{{dead link|date=February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current issues==
=== Racial segregation in American cities ===
{{Main|African-American neighborhood}}

The United States Federal Government has enacted legislation since the 1970s to reduce the segregation of American cities. While many cities have reduced the amount of segregated neighborhoods, some still have clearly defined racial boundaries. Since 1990, the City of [[Chicago]] has been one of the most persistently racially segregated cities, despite efforts to improve mobility and reduce barriers. Other cities like [[Detroit]], [[Houston]], and [[Atlanta]] likewise have very pronounced black and white neighborhoods, the same neighborhoods that were originally redlined by financial institutions decades ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/segregation-us-cities/?noredirect=on |title=America is more diverse than ever — but still segregated |last1=Williams |first1=Aaron |last2=Emamdjomeh |first2=Armand |date=2018 |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=2019-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; While other cities have made progress, this continued racial segregation has contributed to reduced [[economic mobility]] for millions of people.

Formerly redlined neighborhoods in places like Los Angeles have been shown to be more likely to have a [[gang injunction]] issued against them, as the work of geographer [[Stefano Bloch]] and anthropologist [[Susan A. Phillips]] shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00420980211010426?casa_token=DObP9q3K3vIAAAAA%3AtDmGtxRVv5eTSaO3BV7G1xvOElyB6j8jQxFu6YsZbanIBbAeTP8sm6cEEsRiS4TTuHPwPsc4OwbBlw | doi=10.1177/00420980211010426 | title=Mapping and making gangland: A legacy of redlining and enjoining gang neighbourhoods in Los Angeles | year=2022 | last1=Bloch | first1=Stefano | last2=Phillips | first2=Susan A. | journal=Urban Studies | volume=59 | issue=4 | pages=750–770 | s2cid=236550571 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Race wealth gap ===
{{Main|Racial inequality in the United States#Racial wealth gap|Socioeconomic mobility in the United States}}
{{POV section|date=April 2019}}

The practice of redlining actively helped to create what is now known as the [[Racial inequality in the United States#Racial wealth gap|Racial Wealth Gap]] seen in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/reports/2018/02/21/447051/systematic-inequality/ |title=Systematic Inequality |last1=Hanks |first1=Angela |last2=Solomon |first2=Danyelle |website=Center for American Progress |language=en-US |access-date=2018-12-17 |last3=Weller |first3=Christian E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black families in America earned just $57.30 for every $100 in income earned by white families, according to the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey. For every $100 in white family wealth, black families hold just $5.04.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/18/upshot/black-white-wealth-gap-perceptions.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/18/upshot/black-white-wealth-gap-perceptions.html |title=Whites Have Huge Wealth Edge Over Blacks (but Don't Know It) |last=Badger |first=Emily |date=2017-09-18 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the median wealth for black and Hispanic families was $17,600 and $20,700, respectively, compared with white families' median wealth of $171,000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The black-white wealth gap has not recovered from the Great Recession. In 2007, immediately before the Great Recession, the median wealth of blacks was nearly 14 percent that of whites. Although black wealth increased at a faster rate than white wealth in 2016, blacks still owned less than 10 percent of whites' wealth at the median.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A multigenerational study of people from five race groups analyzed upward mobility trends in American cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.3386/w24441 |title=Race and Economic Opportunity in the United States: An Intergenerational Perspective |year=2018 |last1=Chetty |first1=Raj |last2=Hendren |first2=Nathaniel |last3=Jones |first3=Maggie R. |last4=Porter |first4=Sonya R. |issue=NBER Working Paper No. w24441 |doi-access=free}} Later published as: {{Cite journal |doi=10.1093/qje/qjz042 |title=Race and Economic Opportunity in the United States: An Intergenerational Perspective |year=2019 |last1=Chetty |first1=Raj |last2=Hendren |first2=Nathaniel |last3=Jones |first3=Maggie R. |last4=Porter |first4=Sonya R. |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=135 |issue=2 |pages=711–783 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded that black men who grew up in racially segregated neighborhoods were substantially less likely to gain upward economic mobility, finding "black children born to parents in the bottom household income quintile have a 2.5% chance of rising to the top quintile of household income, compared with 10.6% for whites." Because of this intergenerational poverty, black households are "stuck in place" and are less able to grow wealth.

A 2017 study by Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago economists found that redlining—the practice whereby banks discriminated against the inhabitants of certain neighborhoods—had a persistent adverse impact on the neighborhoods, with redlining affecting homeownership rates, home values and credit scores in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |ssrn=3038733 |title=The Effects of the 1930s HOLC "Redlining" Maps |date=2017 |last1=Mazumder |first1=Bhashkar |last2=Hartley |first2=Daniel A. |last3=Aaronson |first3=Daniel |url=https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2017/wp2017-12 |issue=FRB of Chicago Working Paper No. WP–2017–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/upshot/how-redlinings-racist-effects-lasted-for-decades.html |title=How Redlining's Racist Effects Lasted for Decades |last=Badger |first=Emily |date=2017-08-24 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2017-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since many African-Americans could not access conventional home loans, they had to turn to predatory lenders (who charged high interest rates).&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Due to lower home ownership rates, slumlords were able to rent out apartments that would otherwise be owned.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

=== Retail ===
==== Brick and mortar ====
[[Retail]] redlining is a spatially discriminatory practice among retailers. [[Taxicab]] services and delivery food may not serve certain areas, based on their ethnic-minority composition and assumptions about business (and perceived crime), rather than data and economic criteria, such as the potential profitability of operating in those areas. Consequently, consumers in these areas are vulnerable to prices set by fewer retailers. They may be exploited by retailers who charge higher prices and/or offer them inferior goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/0276146705280632 |title=Retail Redlining: Definition, Theory, Typology, and Measurement |journal=Journal of Macromarketing |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=175–186 |year=2005 |last1=d'Rozario |first1=Denver |last2=Williams |first2=Jerome D. |s2cid=54818600 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' found that [[Staples Inc.|Staples]], [[The Home Depot]], [[Rosetta Stone (software)|Rosetta Stone]] and some other online retailers displayed different prices to customers in different locations (distinct from shipping prices).  Staples based discounts on proximity to competitors like [[OfficeMax]] and [[Office Depot]].

==== Liquorlining ====
{{further|Whiteclay, Nebraska}}

Some service providers target low-income neighborhoods for nuisance sales. When those services are believed to have adverse effects on a community, they may considered to be a form of "reverse redlining".  The term "liquorlining" is sometimes used to describe high densities of liquor stores in low income and/or minority communities relative to surrounding areas. High densities of liquor stores are associated with crime and public health issues, which may in turn drive away supermarkets, grocery stores, and other retail outlets, contributing to low levels of economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://woodstockinst.org/document/liquorlining.pdf |title=Liquorlining: Liquor Store Concentration and Community Development in Lower-income Cook County Neighborhoods |last1=Maxwell |first1=Ann |last2=Daniel |first2=Immergluck |date=January 1997 |publisher=Woodstock Institute |access-date=14 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416121921/http://woodstockinst.org/document/liquorlining.pdf |archive-date=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controlled for income, nonwhites face higher concentrations of liquor stores than do whites. One study done on "liquorlining" found that, in urban neighborhoods, there is weak correlation between demand for alcohol and supply of liquor stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Romley |first1=John A. |last2=Cohen |first2=Deborah |last3=Ringel |first3=Jeanne |last4=Sturm |first4=Roland |display-authors=2 |editor-last=Schuckit |editor1-first=Mark A. |date=January 2007 |title=Alcohol and Environmental Justice:The Density of Liquor Stores and Bars in Urban Neighborhoods in the United States |url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/reprints/2008/RAND_RP1323.pdf |journal=Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=48–55 |access-date=14 March 2015 |via=[[RAND Corporation]] |doi=10.15288/jsad.2007.68.48 |pmid=17149517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Student loans ====
In December 2007, a [[class action]] [[lawsuit]] was brought against student loan lending giant [[Sallie Mae]] in the [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut]]. The class alleged that Sallie Mae discriminated against African American and [[Hispanic]] private student loan applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newamerica.net/files/sallie%20mae%20lawsuit.pdf |title=Sasha Rodriguez &amp; Cathelyn Gregoire on Behalf of All Persons Similarly Situated vs. Sallie Mae (SLM) Corporation |publisher=New America Foundation |date=December 17, 2007 |access-date=March 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006133740/http://www.newamerica.net/files/sallie%20mae%20lawsuit.pdf |archive-date=2014-10-06 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case alleged that the factors Sallie Mae used to [[Underwriting|underwrite]] [[private student loans]] caused a [[disparate impact]] on students attending schools with higher minority populations. The suit also alleged that Sallie Mae failed to properly disclose loan terms to private student loan borrowers.

The lawsuit was settled in 2011. The terms of the settlement included Sallie Mae agreeing to make a $500,000 donation to the [[United Negro College Fund]] and the attorneys for the plaintiffs receiving $1.8 million in attorneys' fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ecf.ctd.uscourts.gov/doc1/04113074545 |title=SDSD District Version 1.3 |publisher=United States District Court for the District of Connecticut |access-date=July 25, 2014}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.finaid.org/loans/discrimination.phtml |title=FinAid {{!}} Loans {{!}} Anti-Discrimination Rules for Education Lenders |website=www.finaid.org |access-date=2020-02-18 |archive-date=February 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200218175228/https://www.finaid.org/loans/discrimination.phtml |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Credit cards ====
[[Credit card]] redlining is a spatially discriminatory practice among credit card issuers, of providing different amounts of [[Credit score in the United States|credit]] to different areas, based on their ethnic-minority composition, rather than on economic criteria, such as the potential profitability of operating in those areas.&lt;ref name=Cohen-Cole2011&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1162/REST_a_00052 |title=Credit Card Redlining |year=2011 |last1=Cohen-Cole |first1=Ethan |journal=Review of Economics and Statistics |volume=93 |issue=2 |pages=700–713 |ssrn=1098403 |s2cid=18480342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars assess certain policies, such as credit card issuers reducing credit lines of individuals with a record of purchases at retailers frequented by so-called "high-risk" customers, to be akin to redlining.&lt;ref name=Cohen-Cole2011/&gt;

==== Banks ====
Much of the economic impacts we find as a result of redlining and the banking system directly impact the African American community. Beginning in the 1960s, there was a large influx of black [[veteran]]s and their families moving into suburban white communities. As blacks moved in, whites moved out and the market value of these homes dropped dramatically.  In observation of said market values, bank lenders were able to keep close track by literally drawing red lines around the neighborhoods on a map. These lines signified areas that they would not invest in. By way of racial redlining, not only banks but savings and loans companies, insurance companies, grocery chains, and even pizza delivery companies thwarted economic vitality in black communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor=3132626 |title=Environmental Justice in the 21st Century: Race Still Matters |last1=Bullard |first1=Robert D. |journal=Phylon |volume=49 |issue=3/4 |pages=151–171 |year=2001 |doi=10.2307/3132626 |url=https://uwosh.edu/sirt/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2017/08/Bullard_Environmental-Justice-in-the-21st-Century.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The severe lacking in civil rights laws in combination with the economic impact led to the passing of the [[Community Reinvestment Act]] in 1977.

Racial and economic redlining set the people who live in these communities up for failure from the start, so much so that banks would often deny people who came from these areas bank loans or offered them at stricter repayment rates. As a result, there was a very low rate at which people (in particular African Americans) were able to own their homes; opening the door for [[Slumlord|slum landlords]] (who could get approved for low interest loans in those communities) to take over and do as they saw fit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0094-1190(02)00508-9 |title=Redlining, the Community Reinvestment Act, and private mortgage insurance |journal=Journal of Urban Economics |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=278–297 |year=2004 |last1=Ross |first1=Stephen L. |last2=Tootell |first2=Geoffrey M.B. |url=https://opencommons.uconn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1311&amp;context=econ_wpapers |citeseerx=10.1.1.194.5280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Insurance ====
Gregory D. Squires wrote in 2003 that data showed that race continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry.&lt;ref name="Squires2016"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-9906.t01-1-00168 |title=Racial Profiling, Insurance Style: Insurance Redlining and the Uneven Development of Metropolitan Areas |journal=Journal of Urban Affairs |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=391–410 |year=2016 |last1=Squires |first1=Gregory D |s2cid=10070258}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Racial profiling]] or redlining has a long history in the property-insurance industry in the United States.&lt;ref name="Journal of American History 2021"/&gt; From a review of industry underwriting and marketing materials, court documents, and research by government agencies, industry and community groups, and academics, it is clear that race has long affected and continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry.&lt;ref name="Squires2016" /&gt; Home-insurance agents may try to assess the ethnicity of a potential customer just by telephone, affecting what services they offer to inquiries about purchasing a home insurance policy. This type of discrimination is called [[Linguistic Profiling|linguistic profiling]].&lt;ref name="SquiresChadwick2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1078087405281064 |title=Linguistic Profiling |journal=Urban Affairs Review |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=400–15 |year=2016 |last1=Squires |first1=Gregory D |last2=Chadwick |first2=Jan |s2cid=154136739}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been concerns raised about redlining in the [[car insurance|automotive insurance]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itd.idaho.gov/transporter/2003/080803_Trans/080803_MIuninsured.html Karen Bouffard, "Michigan to crack down on uninsured drivers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128033237/http://www.itd.idaho.gov/transporter/2003/080803_Trans/080803_MIuninsured.html |date=2007-11-28 }}, ''[[The Detroit News]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews of [[insurance score]]s based on credit are shown to have unequal results by ethnic group. The Ohio Department of Insurance in the early 21st century allows insurance providers to use maps and collection of demographic data by ZIP code in determining insurance rates. The FHEO Director of Investigations at the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|Department of Housing and Urban Development]], Sara Pratt, wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://fairhousing.com/resources/history-insurance-redlining |title=The History of Insurance Redlining {{!}} National Fair Housing Advocate Online |website=fairhousing.com |language=en |access-date=2017-03-16 |archive-date=2017-03-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317143050/https://fairhousing.com/resources/history-insurance-redlining |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like other forms of discrimination, the history of insurance redlining began in conscious, overt racial discrimination practiced openly and with significant community support in communities throughout the country. There was documented overt discrimination in practices relating to residential housing—from the appraisal manuals which established an articulated "policy" of preferences based on race, religion and national origin. to lending practices which only made loans available in certain parts of town or to certain borrowers, to the decision-making process in loans and insurance which allowed the insertion of discriminatory assessments into final decisions about either.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Mortgages ====
In reverse redlining, lenders and insurers target minority consumers by charging them more than a similarly situated white consumer would be charged, specifically marketing the most expensive and onerous loan products. In the 2000s, some financial institutions considered black communities as suitable for subprime mortgages. [[Wells Fargo]] partnered with churches in black communities, where pastors would deliver "wealth building" sermons encouraging new mortgage applications. The bank would then make a donation to the church in return for every new application. Many working-class blacks wanted to be included in the nation's home-owning trend. Instead of empowering them to contribute to homeownership and community progress, predatory lending practices through reverse redlining stripped the equity homeowners sought and drained the wealth of those communities for the enrichment of [[Financial institution|financial firms]]. The growth of [[subprime lending]], higher cost loans to borrowers with flaws on their credit records, prior to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 financial crisis]], coupled with growing law enforcement activity in those areas, clearly showed a surge in manipulative practices. Not all subprime loans were predatory, but virtually all [[Predatory lending|predatory loans]] were subprime. Predatory loans are dangerous because they charge unreasonably higher rates and fees compared to the risk, trapping homeowners in unaffordable debt and often costing them their homes and life savings.&lt;ref name="The Recession's Racial Divide"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ehrenreich |first1=Barbara |last2=Muhammad |first2=Dedrick |date=September 13, 2009 |title=The Recession's Racial Divide |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/opinion/13ehrenreich.html?pagewanted=print}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;{{cite news |last=Powell |first=Michael |date=June 7, 2009 |title=Bank Accused of Pushing Mortgage Deals on Blacks |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/us/07baltimore.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey of two districts of similar incomes, one being largely white and the other largely black, found that bank branches in the black community offered exclusively subprime loans. Studies found out that high-income blacks were almost twice as likely to end up with subprime home-purchase mortgages compared to low-income whites. Fueled by deep racism, some loan officers referred to blacks as "mud people" and to subprime lending as "ghetto loans".&lt;ref name="The Recession's Racial Divide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/minority-families-face-wave-of-foreclosures |title=Minority families face wave of foreclosures: Consumer groups urge more 'teeth' in laws combating predators |first=Ruth |last=Mantell |date=July 6, 2007 |access-date=December 22, 2009 |website=marketwatch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lower savings rate and distrust of banks, stemming from this legacy of redlining, may explain why there are fewer financial institutions in minority neighborhoods. In the early 21st century, brokers and telemarketers actively encouraged subprime mortgages to be offered to minority residents. A majority of the loans were refinance transactions, allowing homeowners to take cash out of their appreciating property or pay off credit card and other debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/weekinreview/04bajaj.html |work=The New York Times |first1=Vikas |last1=Bajaj |first2=Ford |last2=Fessenden |title=What's Behind the Race Gap? |date=November 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redlining has helped preserve [[residential segregation in the United States|residential segregation]] between blacks and whites in the United States. Lending institutions such as [[Wells Fargo]] have shown that they treat black mortgage applicants differently when they are buying homes in white neighborhoods than when buying homes in black neighborhoods by offering them subprime and predatory loans when black residents try and integrate neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="The Recession's Racial Divide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor=2564210 |title=Exploring the Neighborhood Contingency of Race Discrimination in Mortgage Lending in Columbus, Ohio |last1=Holloway |first1=Steven R. |journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=252–276 |year=1998 |doi=10.1111/1467-8306.00093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inequality in loaning extends past residential to commercial loans as well; Dan Immergluck writes that in 2002, small businesses in black neighborhoods received fewer loans, even after accounting for business density, business size, industrial mix, neighborhood income, and the credit quality of local businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/107808702401097781 |title=Redlining Redux: Black Neighborhoods, Black-Owned Firms, and the Regulatory Cold Shoulder |journal=Urban Affairs Review |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=22–41 |year=2002 |last1=Immergluck |first1=Dan |s2cid=153818729 |url=https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=spnha_articles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several State Attorneys General have begun investigating these de facto practices, which may violate fair lending laws. The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] filed a class-action lawsuit charging systematic racial discrimination by more than a dozen banks.

=== Environmental racism ===
{{Main|Environmental racism}}
{{See also|Race and health}}

Policies related to redlining and [[urban decay]] can also act as a form of [[environmental racism]], which in turn affect public health. Urban minority communities may face environmental racism in the form of parks that are smaller, less accessible and of poorer quality than those in more affluent or white areas in some cities, which may have an indirect effect on health, since young people have fewer places to play, and adults have fewer opportunities for exercise.&lt;ref name="parks"&gt;''[http://www.berkeleydaily.org/text/article.cfm?issue=11-13-07&amp;storyID=28458 Minority Communities Need More Parks, Report Says]'' by Angela Rowen ''The Berkeley Daily Planet''&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2022 study published in the journal Environmental Science &amp; Technology Letters found redlined areas in 202 US cities had higher levels of air pollution ([[nitrogen dioxide]] and [[fine particulate matter]]) in 2010, so 80 years later.&lt;ref name="acs"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Lane |first1=Haley M. |last2=Morello-Frosch |first2=Rachel |last3=Marshall |first3=Julian D. |last4=Apte |first4=Joshua S. |date=2022-03-09 |title=Historical Redlining Is Associated with Present-Day Air Pollution Disparities in U.S. Cities |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology Letters |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=345–350 |language=en |doi=10.1021/acs.estlett.1c01012|pmid=35434171 |pmc=9009174 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Robert Wallace wrote that the pattern of the [[AIDS]] outbreak during the 80s was affected by the outcomes of a program of "[[planned shrinkage]]" directed at African-American and Hispanic communities. It was implemented through systematic denial of municipal services, particularly fire protection resources, essential to maintain urban levels of population density and ensure community stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=2244222 |year=1990 |last1=Wallace |first1=R. |title=Urban desertification, public health and public order: 'planned shrinkage', violent death, substance abuse and AIDS in the Bronx |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=31 |issue=7 |pages=801–13 |doi=10.1016/0277-9536(90)90175-r}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Institutionalized racism]] affects general health care as well as the quality of AIDS health intervention and services in minority communities. The over-representation of minorities in various disease categories, including AIDS, is partially related to environmental racism. The national response to the AIDS epidemic in minority communities was slow during the 80s and 90s, showing an insensitivity to ethnic diversity in prevention efforts and AIDS health services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmc=2637751 |year=1992 |last1=Hutchinson |first1=J. |title=AIDS and racism in America |journal=Journal of the National Medical Association |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=119–124 |pmid=1602509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital redlining ===
{{Main|Digital redlining}}

''Digital redlining'' is a term used to refer to the practice of creating and perpetuating inequities between racial, cultural, and class groups specifically through the use of digital technologies, digital content, and the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.commonsense.org/education/privacy/blog/digital-redlining-access-privacy |title=Digital Redlining, Access, and Privacy |last=Gilliard |first=Chris |date=2016-05-24 |website=Common Sense Education |language=en |access-date=2019-03-31 |archive-date=March 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331024731/https://www.commonsense.org/education/privacy/blog/digital-redlining-access-privacy |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/how-companies-turn-your-facebook-activity-credit-score/ |title=How Companies Turn Your Facebook Activity Into a Credit Score |last1=Taylor |first1=Astra |date=2015-05-27 |access-date=2019-03-31 |last2=Sadowski |first2=Jathan |work=The Nation |archive-date=March 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331024730/https://www.thenation.com/article/how-companies-turn-your-facebook-activity-credit-score/ |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Digital redlining'' is an extension of the historical housing discrimination practice of redlining to include an ability to discriminate against vulnerable classes of society using algorithms, connected digital technologies, and big data.&lt;ref&gt;Podesta, John; Penny, Pritzker; Moniz, Earnest, J.; Holdren, John; Zients, Jeffery (May 2014).

For example, in March 2019 the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) charged [[Facebook]] with housing discrimination over the company's targeted advertising practices.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_19_035 |title=HUD Charges Facebook With Housing Discrimination Over Company's Targeted Advertising Practices |date=2019-03-28 |website=www.hud.gov |access-date=2019-03-31 |archive-date=2019-03-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331013138/https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_19_035 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these charges included geographically based targeting in the form of a tool that allowed advertisers to draw a red line on a map; they also included non-geographically based methods that did not use maps but rather utilized algorithmic targeting using Facebook's user profile information to directly exclude specific groups of people. A press release from HUD on March 28, 2019, stated that HUD was charging that "Facebook enabled advertisers to exclude people whom Facebook classified as parents; non-American-born; non-Christian; interested in accessibility; interested in Hispanic culture; or a wide variety of other interests that closely align with the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968|Fair Housing Act]]'s protected classes."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Redlining and Health Inequality ===
Health inequality in the United States persists today as a direct result of the effects of redlining. This is because health in America is synonymous with wealth, both of which minority groups have been denied as a result of discriminatory practices. Wealth affords the privilege of living in a neighborhood or community with clean air, pure water, outdoor spaces and places for recreation and exercise, safe streets during the day and night, infrastructure that supports the growth of intergenerational wealth through access to good schools, healthy food, public transportation, and opportunities to connect, belong, and contribute to the surrounding community. Wealth also provides stability of home as those with capital are not confined to the deteriorating housing stock that minority groups who were redlined were forced to try and rehabilitate without access to loans.&lt;ref&gt;"In sickness and in wealth" Unnatural Causes. www.unnaturalcauses.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Housing and Homelessness as a Public Health Issue: APHA Policy Brief Nov 07 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beauchamp 1976"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beauchamp |first1=Dan E. |title=Public Health as Social Justice |journal=Inquiry |date=1976 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=3–14 |pmid=130348 |jstor=29770972 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Link |first1=Bruce G. |last2=Phelan |first2=Jo |title=Social Conditions As Fundamental Causes of Disease |journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior |date=1995 |volume=Spec No |pages=80–94 |id={{ProQuest|201654321}} |doi=10.2307/2626958 |jstor=2626958 |pmid=7560851 |hdl=1903/24678 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bailey |first1=Zinzi D |last2=Krieger |first2=Nancy |last3=Agénor |first3=Madina |last4=Graves |first4=Jasmine |last5=Linos |first5=Natalia |last6=Bassett |first6=Mary T |title=Structural racism and health inequities in the USA: evidence and interventions |journal=The Lancet |date=April 2017 |volume=389 |issue=10077 |pages=1453–1463 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30569-X |pmid=28402827 |s2cid=4669313 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redlining intentionally excluded black Americans from accumulating intergenerational wealth. The effects of this exclusion on black Americans' health continues to play out daily, generations later, in the same communities. This is evident currently in the disproportionate effects that COVID-19 has had on the same communities which the HOLC redlined in the 1930s. Research published in September 2020 overlaid maps of the highly affected COVID-19 areas with the HOLC maps, showing that those areas marked “risky” to lenders because they contained minority residents were the same neighborhoods most ravaged by COVID-19. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) looks at inequities in the social determinants of health like concentrated poverty and healthcare access that are interrelated and influence health outcomes with regard to COVID-19 as well as quality-of-life in general for minority groups. The CDC points to discrimination within health care, education, criminal justice, housing, and finance, direct results of systematically subversive tactics like redlining which led to chronic and toxic stress that shaped social and economic factors for minority groups, increasing their risk for COVID-19. Healthcare access is similarly limited by factors like a lack of public transportation, child care, and communication and language barriers which result from the spatial and economic isolation of minority communities from redlining. Educational, income, and wealth gaps that result from this isolation mean that minority groups' limited access to the job market may force them to remain in fields that have higher risk of exposure to the virus, without options to take time off. Finally, a direct result of redlining is the overcrowding of minority groups into neighborhoods that do not boast adequate housing to sustain burgeoning populations, leading to crowded conditions that make prevention strategies of COVID-19 nearly impossible to implement.&lt;ref&gt;“Mapping Inequality.” Digital Scholarship Lab, dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Jason |last1=Richardson |first2=Bruce C. |last2=Mitchell |first3=Helen C.S. |last3=Meier |first4=Emily |last4=Lynch |first5=Jad |last5=Edlebi |title=Redlining and Neighborhood Health |publisher=NCRC |url=https://ncrc.org/holc-health/ |date=10 September 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Myers, JoAnne 2020"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Myers |first1=JoAnne |title=The good citizen: the markers of privilege in America |date=2020 |isbn=978-1-351-00669-9 |oclc=1111653987 |doi=10.4324/9781351006705 |s2cid=211349002 }}{{page needed|date=March 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Badger |first1=Emily |title=Can the Racial Wealth Gap Be Closed Without Speaking of Race? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/upshot/racial-wealth-gap-2020-candidates.html |work=The New York Times |date=10 May 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Danaei |first1=Goodarz |last2=Rimm |first2=Eric B. |last3=Oza |first3=Shefali |last4=Kulkarni |first4=Sandeep C. |last5=Murray |first5=Christopher J.

After years of de facto discrimination achieved through redlining, a system of structural racism blocking the achievement of health equity for all Americans has developed. As a result, a de facto health narrative that does not inspire belonging, compel political participation, nor dictate strategic change towards the social justice model for health equity has matured. In order to eliminate health inequality in America, a new de facto health narrative needs to dictate strategy. The process for achieving health equity relies on healthcare leaders articulating, acting on, and building the vision into all decisions and structures that support equity. Sufficient resources must be allocated to establishing a governance structure that can oversee health equity work. This includes taking specific action to address the social determinants of building intergenerational wealth as well as confronting institutional racism within health systems themselves. Next, health systems need to address the socioeconomic determinants of health which disadvantage minority groups. Through training, education, support groups, housing support, improved transportation, resource assistance, and community health programs, health equity organizations can begin to break down the long-lasting barriers that tactics like redlining have imposed on achieving health equity. In addition to ensuring the equal health outcomes of patients, healthcare organizations can also utilize their position as employers to develop a more diverse workforce through improved hiring practices and ensuring living wages to minority employees.&lt;ref&gt;Rothstein, Richard.

== Strategies to reverse effects of redlining ==
Redlining has contributed to the long-term decline of low-income, [[inner city]] neighborhoods and the continuation of ethnic minority [[ethnic enclaves|enclaves]]. Compared to prospering ethnic minority areas, historically redlined or other struggling black communities need targeted investments in infrastructure and services in order to prosper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Height |first=Tatiana |date=2017 |title=Analyzing Communities in Black America: How Urban and Regional Planners Can Plan for Prosperous Black Communities |type=Thesis |publisher=University of Nebraska-Lincoln |pages=57–63 |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/arch_crp_theses/47 |access-date=2019-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these strategies include:
* Targeting planning resources to improve employment, incomes, wealth, the built environment, and social services in struggling communities. 
* Recognize the importance of [[public transportation]] as a means for low-income communities to access jobs and services. 
* Provide jobs near the labor supply through targeted [[economic development]]. 
* Invest in the housing stock through neighborhood revitalization programs.
* Utilize [[inclusionary zoning]] (IZ) ordinances to improve amounts of high quality housing. 
* Equitably distribute [[hazardous waste]] sites so they are not concentrated in low-income and minority areas.
