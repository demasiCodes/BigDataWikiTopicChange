'''Redlining''' is the practice of denying, or increasing the cost of, services such as [[banking]], [[insurance]], [[Job (role)|access to jobs]],&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.core.ucl.ac.be/services/psfiles/dp99/dp9913.pdf Racial Discrimination and Redlining in Cities]''&lt;/ref&gt; access to health care,&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Race and health]]&lt;/ref&gt; or even [[supermarkets]]&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.springerlink.com/content/ptc5hvexthe7wrye/ In poor health: Supermarket redlining and urban nutrition]'', Elizabeth Eisenhauer, [[GeoJournal]] Volume 53, Number 2 / February, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; to residents in certain, often racially determined,&lt;ref name="eastny"&gt;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=TWo8OFJpFtAC How East New York Became a Ghetto]'' by Walter Thabit. ISBN 0814782671. Page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; areas.  The term "redlining" was coined in the late 1960s by community activists in Chicago. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} It describes the practice of marking a red line on a map to delineate the area where banks would not invest; later the term was applied to [[discrimination]] against a particular group of people (usually by [[racism|race]] or [[sexism|sex]]) no matter the geography. During the heyday of redlining, the areas most frequently discriminated against were black [[inner city]] neighborhoods. Through at least the 1990s this practice meant that banks would often lend to lower income whites but not to middle or upper income blacks.&lt;ref name="Color of Money"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://powerreporting.com/color/|title=The Color of Money |last=Dedman |first=Bill |date=1988-05-01 |publisher=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Reverse redlining" is a term often used to describe situations where a lender or insurer particularly targets minority consumers, not to deny them loans or insurance, but rather to charge them more than would be charged to a similarly situated majority consumer.

== History of the practice ==
{{Segregation}}
Although in the [[United States]] informal discrimination and segregation have always existed, the practice called "redlining" began with the [[National Housing Act of 1934]], which established the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA).&lt;ref name = "jackson"/&gt;  The federal government contributed to the early decay of inner city neighborhoods by withholding mortgage capital and making it difficult for these neighborhoods to attract and retain families able to purchase homes.&lt;ref name = "wilson"/&gt; In 1935, the [[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]] (FHLBB) asked [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation]] (HOLC) to look at 239 cities and create "residential security maps" to indicate the level of security for real-estate investments in each surveyed city. Such maps defined many minority neighborhoods in cities as ineligible to receive financing.  The maps were based on assumptions about the community, not accurate assessments of an individual's or household's ability to satisfy standard lending criteria.  Since blacks were unwelcome in white neighborhoods, which frequently instituted racial [[restrictive covenant]]s to keep them out, the policy effectively meant that blacks could not secure [[mortgage loan]]s at all.  At various times the practice also affected other ethnic groups, including Latinos, Asians, and Jews.  The assumptions in redlining resulted in a large increase in residential [[racial segregation]] and [[urban decay]] in the United States. Urban planning historians theorize that the maps were used by private and public entities for years afterwards to deny loans to people in black communities.&lt;ref name = "jackson"/&gt;  However, recent research has indicated that the HOLC did not redline in its own lending activities, and that the racist language reflected the bias of the private sector and experts hired to conduct the appraisals.&lt;ref&gt; [http://bellwether.metapress.com/content/h128812346540080/ Crossney and Bartelt 2005 Urban Geography][http://www.mi.vt.edu/data/files/hpd%20vol.16%20issues%203%20and%204/articles/hpd6(3,4)%20crossney.pdf Crossney and Bartelt 2006 Housing Policy Debate]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the maps, the newest areas — those considered desirable for lending purposes — were outlined in blue and known as "Type A". These were typically affluent suburbs on the outskirts of cities. "Type B" neighborhoods were considered "Still Desirable", whereas older "Type C" were labeled "Declining" and outlined in yellow.
"Type D" neighborhoods were outlined in red and were considered the most risky for mortgage support. These neighborhoods tended to be the older districts in the center of cities; often they were also [[black neighborhoods]].&lt;ref name="jackson"&gt;Jackson, Kenneth T. Crabgrass Frontier: The Suburbanization of the United States. New York: Oxford University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some redlined maps were also created by private organizations, such as J.M. Brewer's 1934 map of Philadelphia.  Private organizations created maps designed to meet the requirements of the [[Federal Housing Administration]]'s underwriting manual. The lenders had to consider FHA standards if they wanted to receive FHA insurance for their loans. FHA appraisal manuals instructed banks to steer clear of areas with "''inharmonious racial groups''" and recommended that municipalities enact racially restrictive zoning ordinances, as well as [[restrictive covenant|covenants]] prohibiting black owners.&lt;ref&gt;''Principles to Guide Housing Policy at the Beginning of the Millennium'', Michael Schill &amp; Susan Wachter, [[Cityscape]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.public.asu.edu/~wplotkin/DeedsWeb/fha38.html "Racial" Provisions of FHA Underwriting Manual, 1938] &lt;blockquote&gt;Recommended restrictions should include provision for the following:
Prohibition of the occupancy of properties '''except by the race for which they are intended''' …Schools should be appropriate to the needs of the new community and they should not be attended in large numbers by '''inharmonious racial groups'''. [[Federal Housing Administration]], Underwriting Manual: Underwriting and Valuation Procedure Under Title II of the [[National Housing Act]] With Revisions to February, 1938 (Washington, D.C.), Part II, Section 9, Rating of Location.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Redlining paralyzed the housing market, lowered property values and further encouraged landlord abandonment. As abandonment increased, the population density became lower. Abandoned buildings would serve as havens for drug dealing and other illegal activity.&lt;ref name = "wilson"/&gt;

The film ''[[Revolution '67]]'' examines the practice of redlining that occurred in Newark, NJ in the 1960s.

== Challenges to redlining ==
{{African American topics sidebar|right}}
In the [[United States]], the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]] was passed to fight the practice.  It prohibited redlining when the criteria for redlining are based on race, religion, gender, familial status, disability, or ethnic origin.  The [[Community Reinvestment Act]] of 1977 further required banks to apply the same lending criteria in all communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0813339529 Comeback Cities: A Blueprint for Urban Neighborhood Revival] By Paul S. Grogan, Tony Proscio. ISBN 0813339529. Published 2002. Page 114.&lt;blockquote&gt;The goal was not to relax lending restrictions but rather to get banks to apply the same criteria to residents in the inner-city as in the [[suburbs]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Although open redlining was made illegal in the 70s through community reinvestment legislation, the practice continued in less overt ways.&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;''[[When Work Disappears]]: The World of the New Urban Poor'' By William Julius Wilson. 1996. ISBN 0679724176&lt;/ref&gt;, and many allege that the redlining target group has shifted from African Americans to the [[LGBT community]].&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=2TM0DaR1WjwC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=Redlining+gay+neighborhoods&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Ouzhkv1szd&amp;sig=lBUTeWSXjOV8iRnIaNcHLf2AXuQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ShoreBank]], a community-development bank in [[Chicago]]'s [[South Shore]] neighborhood, was a part of the private-sector fight against redlining.&lt;ref name="shorebank"&gt;Douthwaite, Richard.

Retrieved on [[January 9]], [[2007]].&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1992 speech, then-Presidential candidate [[Bill Clinton]] called ShoreBank “the most important bank in America.”&lt;ref name="shorebank"/&gt;

==Contemporary issues==
Dan Immergluck writes that in 2002 small businesses in black neighborhoods still received fewer loans, even after accounting for business density, business size, industrial mix, neighborhood income, and the credit quality of local businesses.&lt;ref&gt;''Redlining Redux'' Urban Affairs Review, Vol. 38, No. 1, 22–41 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory D. Squires wrote in 2003 that it is clear that race has long affected and continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry.&lt;ref&gt;Racial Profiling, Insurance Style: Insurance Redlining and the Uneven Development of Metropolitan Areas Journal of Urban Affairs 25 (4), 391–410. &lt;/ref&gt; Workers living in American inner cities have a harder time finding jobs than suburban workers.&lt;ref&gt;''Racial Discrimination and Redlining in Cities'' Yves Zenou and Nicolas Boccard 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Redlining has helped preserve segregated living patterns for blacks and whites in the United States, because discrimination motivated by [[prejudice]] is often contingent on the racial composition of neighborhoods where the loan is sought and the race of the applicant. Lending institutions{{Who|date=February 2009}} have been shown to treat black mortgage applicants differently when they are buying homes in white neighborhoods than when buying homes in black neighborhoods.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} &lt;ref&gt;Stephen R Holloway (1998) ''Exploring the Neighborhood Contingency of Race Discrimination in Mortgage Lending in Columbus, Ohio'' Annals of the Association of American Geographers 88 (2), 252–276.&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{Who|date=February 2009}} even think that the [[Gay community]] as of 2009, are suffering similar practices that were similar to redlining.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

===Retail===
[[Retail]] redlining is a spatially discriminatory practice among retailers, of not serving certain areas, based on their ethnic-minority composition, rather than on economic criteria, such as the potential profitability of operating in those areas. Consequently, consumers in these areas often find themselves "vulnerable" because no other retailers will serve them.  They may be exploited by other, often smaller, retailers who charge them higher prices and/or offer them inferior goods.&lt;ref&gt;''Retail Redlining: Definition, Theory, Typology, and Measurement'' Denver D’Rozario Journal of Macromarketing, Vol. 25, No. 2, 175-186 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Credit cards===
[[Credit card]] redlining is a spatially discriminatory practice among credit card issuers, of providing different amounts of credit to different areas, based on their ethnic-minority composition, rather than on economic criteria, such as the potential profitability of operating in those areas. &lt;ref&gt;''Cohen-Cole, Ethan, "Credit Card Redlining" (2008). FRB of Boston Quantitative Analysis Unit Working Paper No. QAU08-1 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1098403 http://www.bos.frb.org/bankinfo/qau/wp/2008/qau0801.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Many believe policies of credit card companies such as [[American Express]] that reduce credit lines of individuals that make purchases at retailers frequented by so-called "high-risk" customers to be akin to redlining. &lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/GetsAnswers/Story?id=6747461]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insurance===
[[Racial profiling]] or redlining has a long history in the property-[[insurance]] industry in the United States. From a review of industry underwriting and marketing materials, court documents, and research by government agencies, industry and community groups, and academics, it is clear that race has long affected and continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry.&lt;ref&gt;''Gregory D. Squires (2003)
Racial Profiling, Insurance Style: Insurance Redlining and the Uneven Development of Metropolitan Areas'' Journal of Urban Affairs Volume 25 Issue 4 Page 391-410, November 2003 &lt;/ref&gt; Home-insurance agents are generally able to detect the race of someone who contacts them by telephone.  This information affects the services provided to those who inquire about purchasing a home-insurance policy. This type of discrimination is called linguistic [[racial profiling|profiling]].&lt;ref&gt;''Linguistic Profiling: A Continuing Tradition of Discrimination in the Home Insurance Industry?'' Gregory D. Squires Urban Affairs Review, Vol. 41, No. 3, 400-415 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been concerns raised about redlining in the [[car insurance|automotive insurance]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.itd.idaho.gov/transporter/2003/080803_Trans/080803_MIuninsured.html Michigan to crack down on uninsured drivers]'' By Karen Bouffard [[The Detroit News]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student Loans===
In December 2007, a [[class action]] [[lawsuit]] was brought against student loan lending giant [[Sallie Mae]] in the [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut]], alleging that Sallie Mae discriminates against [[African American]] and [[Hispanic]] private student loan applicants. [http://www.newamerica.net/files/sallie%20mae%20lawsuit.pdf] 

The case further alleges that the factors Sallie Mae uses to [[underwrite]] [[private student loans]] cause a [[disparate impact]] on students attending schools with disproportionate minority populations. The suit also alleges that Sallie Mae fails to properly disclose loan terms to private student loan borrowers. The case is in active litigation. 

===Environmental racism===
{{Main|environmental racism}}
{{See also|Race and health}}
Policies related to redlining and [[urban decay]] can also act as a form of [[environmental racism]], which in turn have an impact on public health. Urban minority communities may face environmental racism in the form of parks that are smaller, less accessible and of poorer quality than those in more affluent or white areas in some cities.&lt;ref name="parks"&gt;''[http://www.berkeleydaily.org/text/article.cfm?issue=11-13-07&amp;storyID=28458 Minority Communities Need More Parks, Report Says]'' by Angela Rowen The Berkeley Daily Planet&lt;/ref&gt; This may have an indirect impact on health, since young people have fewer places to play and adults have fewer opportunities for exercise.&lt;ref name="parks"&gt;''[http://www.berkeleydaily.org/text/article.cfm?issue=11-13-07&amp;storyID=28458 Minority Communities Need More Parks, Report Says]'' by Angela Rowen The Berkeley Daily Planet&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Wallace writes that the pattern of the [[AIDS]] outbreak during the '80s was affected by the outcomes of a program of '[[planned shrinkage]]' directed at African-American and Hispanic communities.  It was implemented through systematic denial of municipal services, particularly fire protection resources, essential to maintain urban levels of population density and ensure community stability.&lt;ref&gt;''Urban desertification, public health and public order: 'planned shrinkage', violent death, substance abuse and AIDS in the Bronx.'' Wallace R. Soc Sci Med, 1990 - ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/ref&gt; [[Institutionalized racism]] affects general health care as well as the quality of AIDS health intervention and services in minority communities. The overrepresentation of minorities in various disease categories, including AIDS, is partially related to environmental racism. The national response to the AIDS epidemic in minority communities was slow during the '80s and '90s, showing an insensitivity to ethnic diversity in prevention efforts and AIDS health services.&lt;ref&gt;''AIDS and racism in America.'' Hutchinson J., Journal of the National Medical Association, 1992 Feb;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Liquorlining ==
Instead of ''denial'' of services to low-income neighborhoods, sometimes the exact ''opposite'' can occur as well when it is believed to be the ''most'' lucrative option for the service providers. When those services are believed to have adverse effects on a community, that can be considered to be a form of "reverse redlining."  The term "liquorlining" is sometimes used&lt;ref name="74.125.47.132"&gt;http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:2idAdUp_A1AJ:www.woodstockinst.org/publications/download/liquorlining:-liquor-store-concentration-and-community-development-in-lower%2511income-cook-county-neighborhoods/+liquorlining&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the practice of encouraging very high density of liquor stores and other alcohol outlets in low income and/or minority communities relative to surrounding areas, implicitly by design.  This is believed by some&lt;ref name="74.125.47.132"/&gt; to cause a neighborhood to go downhill in terms of crime and quality of life.  However, unlike redlining, this is usually not illegal.
