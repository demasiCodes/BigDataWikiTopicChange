&lt;/ref&gt; Influential figures in the movement include the far-right anti-Muslim conspiracy theorists [[Pamela Geller]] and [[Robert B. Spencer|Robert Spencer]].

While the roots of the movement go back to the 1980s, it did not gain significant momentum until after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] and the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]]. As far back as 2006, online commentators such as [[Fjordman]] were identified as playing a key role in forwarding the nascent counter-jihad ideology.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; [[Bat Ye'or]]'s [[Eurabia]] theory published in her eponymous book in 2005 also played an important factor in forming the movement. The movement received considerable attention in 2011 following the [[2011 Norway attacks|lone wolf attacks by right-wing extremist Anders Behring Breivik]] whose manifesto extensively reproduced the writings of prominent counter-jihad bloggers, and following the emergence of prominent street movements such as the [[English Defence League]] (EDL).&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; The movement has adherents both in Europe and in North America. The European wing is more focused on the alleged cultural threat to European traditions stemming from immigrant Muslim populations, while the American wing emphasizes an alleged external threat, essentially terrorist in nature.&lt;ref name="svd.se"/&gt;

Several academic accounts have presented [[conspiracy theories]] as a key component of the counter-jihad movement.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Lee (2016):

==Overview==
Counter-jihad is a radical right-wing movement&lt;ref name=Fleischer/&gt; that operates, according to Toby Archer, via the "sharing of ideas between Europeans and Americans and daily linking between blogs and websites on both sides of the Atlantic",&lt;ref name=Archer2013/&gt; and, according to Rasmus Fleischer, "calls for a counterjihad against the supposed [[Eurabia|Islamisation of Europe]]".&lt;ref name=Fleischer/&gt;
While the roots of the movement go back to the 1980s, it did not gain significant momentum until after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=tnyt1/&gt;

The authors of ''Right-Wing Populism in Europe: Politics and Discourse'' describe the movement as heavily relying on two key tactics:
{{blockquote|The first is arguing that the most radical Muslims – men like [[Osama bin Laden]] – are properly interpreting the [[Quran]], while peaceful moderate Muslims either do not understand their own holy book or are strategically faking their moderation. The second key tactic is to relentlessly attack individuals and organizations that purport to represent moderate Islam...painting them as secret operatives in a grand Muslim scheme to destroy the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beirich|first1=Heidi |editor=Wodak, Ruth |editor2=KhosraviNik, Majid |editor3=Mral, Brigitte|title=Right-Wing Populism in Europe: Politics and Discourse|date=2013|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|location=London|isbn=978-1-78093-343-6|pages=91–92|chapter=Hate Across the Waters: The Role of American Extremists in Fostering an International White Consciousness}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Benjamin Lee describes the "counter-jihad scene" as one where 
{{blockquote|Europe and the United States are under threat from an aggressive and politicized Islamic world that is attempting to take over Europe through a process of "Islamification" with the eventual aim of imposing [[Sharia law]]. In this process, the threat is characterized by the perceived removal of Christian or Jewish symbols, the imposition of Islamic traditions, and the creation of [[no-go area]]s for non-Muslims. The construction of [[mosques]] in particular is seen as continued reinforcement of the separation of the Muslim population from the wider populous. As strong as the threatening practices of Muslims in descriptions of the counter jihad are images of a powerless Europe in decline and sliding into decadence, unable to resist Islamic takeover. The idea that European culture in particular is in a state of decline, while a spiritually vigorous East represented by Islam is in the ascendancy in civil society, is a common sentiment in some circles.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;}}

Two central counter-jihad themes have been identified: 
* the notion that Islam poses a threat to "Western civilisation", with a particular focus on "Muslims living in Europe", that is, within the European Counterjihad Movement (ECJM), "seen predominantly in terms of immigration",&lt;ref name=Archer2013/&gt; particularly Muslim immigration.&lt;ref name=HitchensBrun2013/&gt; 
* a lack of trust in regional, political and economic "elites", with a particular focus against the European Union (EU).&lt;ref name=Archer2013&gt;{{cite book|author1=Toby Archer|author-link1=Breivik's Mindset|editor1-last=Taylor|editor1-first=Max|editor2-last=Currie|editor2-first=P.M.|editor3-last=Holbrook|editor3-first=Donald|title=Extreme right wing political violence and terrorism|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=9781441140876|pages=173–4|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;!--|access-date=23 May 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first organizations of the counter-jihad movement (CJM), the 910 Group (later renamed to the [[International Civil Liberties Alliance]]) was founded in 2006 and announced on [[Gates of Vienna]], "a principal blog of the CJM since 2004". Its stated purpose was to defend "liberties, human rights, and religious and political freedoms [that] are under assault from extremist groups who believe in Islamist supremacy".&lt;ref name=UPE&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding the Populist Shift: Othering in a Europe in Crisis|editor=Gabriella Lazaridis|editor2=Giovanna Campani|pages=70–103|isbn=978-1138101654|publisher= Routledge|year=2016|author=Gabriella Lazaridis|author2=Marilou Polymeropoulou|author3=Vasiliki Tsagkroni}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007, the counter-jihad current became visible as a movement operating in northwestern Europe with "The UK and Scandinavia Counterjihad Summit", organised by a transatlantic network of anti-Islam bloggers in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark.&lt;ref name="expo19"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://expo.se/fakta/wiki/counterjihad|title=Counterjihad|work=Expo|language=Swedish|date=8 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was hosted by American blogger Edward May, Danish activist [[Anders Gravers Pedersen]], and Danish blogger Exile, and included participants such as Norwegian blogger [[Fjordman]].&lt;ref name="expo19"/&gt;

In October 2007 a second summit, "Counterjihad Brussels 2007", was hosted by the Belgian [[Flemish Movement|Flemish-nationalist]] party [[Vlaams Belang]] in the [[European Parliament]] building in Brussels, Belgium.&lt;ref name="Fleischer"&gt;

From 2009, the [[English Defence League]] (EDL) street movement began holding rallies. A March 2012 counter-jihad conference in Denmark drew 200–300 supporters from throughout Europe. Ten times the number of left-wing protesters staged a counter-demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;

* Create state organizations that work towards the initiative's aims at a local level
* Organize grass root small groups at the local level to fight what it labels "specific Islamic supremacist initiatives" in American cities
* Build strategic alliances with activist groups in Europe and Israel to engage in open and stealthy counter jihad measures
* Promote candidates who "fight against the march of Islamic supremacists"
* Host conferences "that educate Americans about Leftist indoctrination and Islam’s quest for domination"

SIOA has been accused by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] of
&lt;blockquote&gt;promot[ing] a conspiratorial anti-Muslim agenda under the guise of fighting radical Islam. The group seeks to rouse public fears by consistently vilifying the Islamic faith and asserting the existence of an Islamic conspiracy to destroy "American" values.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous affiliated "Stop the Islamisation" and "Defense Leagues" in several European countries,&lt;ref name=Townsend2012/&gt; among them [[Stop Islamisation of Denmark]], [[Stop Islamisation of Norway]], and the [[English Defence League]].

==Counter-jihad ideology==
In the words of Toby Archer, a scholar of political extremism and terrorism, &lt;blockquote&gt;"Counter-jihad discourse mixes valid concerns about [[Islamic terrorism|jihad-inspired terrorism]] with far more complex political issues about immigration to Europe from predominantly Muslim countries. It suggests that there is a threat not just from terrorism carried out by Islamic extremists but from Islam itself. Therefore, by extension, all European Muslims are a threat."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Arun Kundnani, in a report published by the International Centre for Counter-terrorism, writes that the counter-jihad movement has evolved from earlier European far-right movements through a shift from race to values as identity markers: "In moving from neo‐Nazism to counter‐jihadism, the underlying structure of the narrative remains the same." Continuing on this note, he writes that comparing the counter-jihadist worldview to the older, neo-Nazi one, "Muslims have taken the place of blacks and multiculturalists are the new Jews."&lt;ref name=Kundnani&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

According to prominent counter-jihadist Edward S. May, writing under the pseudonym Baron Bodissey, the counter-jihadist movement is based on the belief that &lt;blockquote&gt;"Islam is above all a totalitarian political ideology, sugar-coated with the trappings of a primitive desert religion to help veil its true nature. The publicly stated goal of Islamic theology and political ideology is to impose the rule of Islam over the entire world, and make it part of Dar al-Islam, the 'House of Submission'."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Cas Mudde]] argues that various [[conspiracy theories]] with roots in [[Bat Ye'or]]'s [[Eurabia]] are important to the movement. The main theme of these theories is an allegation that European leaders allow a Muslim dominance of Europe, whether by intention or not, through multicultural policies and lax [[immigration laws]].&lt;ref name=MorgEur&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hope not Hate]], counter-jihad discourse has replaced the racist discourse of rightwing, populist and nationalist politics in America and Europe "with the language of cultural and identity wars".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Counter-jihad Report|url=http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/counter-jihad|website=Hope Not Hate|access-date=21 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705190727/http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/counter-jihad/|archive-date=5 July 2012|location=Internet Archive|date=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EDL6.jpg|thumb|300px|left|English Defence League rally in Newcastle, UK, 2010]]

Toby Archer detects a difference between the European and American wings of the movement. The American wing emphasizes an external threat, essentially terrorist in nature. The European wing sees a cultural threat to European traditions stemming from immigrant Muslim populations. While Archer notes that the perceived failure of multi-culturalism is shared across much of the political spectrum, he argues the counter-jihad movement is a particular conservative manifestation of this trend. He acknowledges the movement's conservative defense of human rights and the rule of law but he believes by rejecting progressive policy it rejects much of what Europe is today.&lt;ref name="svd.se"/&gt;

The views of the counter-jihad movement have been criticized as a source of support for the anti-Muslim views of individuals inspired to take violent direct action.&lt;ref name=tnyt2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anders Behring Breivik]], responsible for the [[2011 Norway attacks]], published a manifesto explaining his views which drew heavily on the work of counter-jihad bloggers such as [[Fjordman]].&lt;ref name="tnyt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dsp"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Pipes]] argues that a "close reading of his manifesto suggests" that Breivik wanted to discredit and undermine the movement's dedication to democratic change to further Breivik's "dreamed-for revolution" as the only alternative.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Breivik has later identified himself as a [[Fascism|fascist]] and voiced support for [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]], stating that he had exploited counter-jihad rhetoric in order to protect "[[Ethnic nationalism|ethno-nationalists]]", and instead start a media drive against what he deemed "anti-nationalist counterjihad"-supporters.&lt;ref name="Expo14"&gt;

Executive director of the [[Institute of Race Relations (United Kingdom)|Institute of Race Relations]], [[Liz Fekete]], has argued that although most of the counter-jihad movement "stops short of advocating violence to achieve their goals", the most extreme parts share much of Breivik's discursive frameworks and vocabulary. She counterposits this with more mainstream counter-jihadists, that warn of Islamisation as a result of naïvety or indecisiveness, whom she identifies as a source of legitimacy for the former.&lt;ref name=Fekete2012&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Fekete |first=Liz |title=The Muslim conspiracy theory and the Oslo massacre |journal=Race &amp; Class |volume=53 |issue=3 |year=2012 |pages=30–47 |doi=10.1177/0306396811425984 |s2cid=146443283 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Theologist and philosopher Marius Timmann Mjaaland has described the [[Christianism|role]] given to [[Christianity]] in some parts of the counter-jihad movement and has identified some aspects of the movement's ideology that he says links it to [[Christofascism|fascism-like]] conspiracy theories: 
#The establishment of an allegedly continuous and coherent connection between the present-day conflict between the Christian West and Muslims, whereas analyses based on established historical science will dismiss any such claim as unfounded.
#A claim that mainstream politicians and media in Western countries have in effect become internal enemies or "traitors", by respectively allowing the creation of [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] societies and advocating "Marxism" and "political correctness".
#This, in turn, has allowed Muslims to settle in Western lands, and thereby allegedly opened them to attack from within.
#And, lastly, a [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]], post-Christian worldview where the distinction between good and evil is given little attention, to the point where Christianity's ideal of "[[The Golden Rule|loving one's neighbour]]" is entirely omitted. Christianity is reduced from a system of belief to an identity marker, and a political mythology is built, that draws heavily on the [[Crusades]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Counter-jihad has sought to portray Western Muslims as a "[[fifth column]]", collectively seeking to destabilize Western nations' identity and values for the benefit of an international Islamic movement intent on the [[Eurabia|establishment of a caliphate in Western countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Akbarzadeh|first1=Shahram|last2=Roose|first2=Joshua M.|title=Muslims, Multiculturalism and the Question of the Silent Majority|journal=Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs|date=September 2011|volume=31|issue=3|pages=309–325|doi=10.1080/13602004.2011.599540|s2cid=145595802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the Eurabia literature and Counter Jihad forums describe ''[[taqiyya]]'' as a manipulative strategy used by [[moderate Muslims]] to infiltrate and eventually overthrow society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nilsson|first1=Per-Erik|title='Secular Retaliation': A Case Study of Integralist Populism, Anti-Muslim Discourse, and (Il)liberal Discourse on Secularism in Contemporary France|journal=Politics, Religion &amp; Ideology|date=17 February 2015|volume=16|issue=1|pages=87–106|doi=10.1080/21567689.2015.1012160|s2cid=143457958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters are often pro-Israel.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;

===Comparison with anti-communism===
The movement has been compared to the [[anti-communism]] of the [[Cold War]]. The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] compares both as similar exaggerated threats. "Like the communists that an earlier generation believed to be hiding behind every rock, infiltrated 'Islamist' operatives today are said to be diabolically preparing for a forcible takeover."&lt;ref name=SPLC&gt;
