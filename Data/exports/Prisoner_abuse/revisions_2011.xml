'''Prisoner abuse''' is the mistreatment of persons while they are under arrest or incarcerated.
Abuse falling into this category includes:
* '''[[Physical abuse]]:''' Needless beating, hitting, or other [[corporal punishment]].
* '''[[Psychological abuse]]:''' Taunting, [[sleep deprivation]], or other forms of psychological abuse, occasionally [[white noise]]
* '''[[Sexual abuse]]:''' Forced intercourse, genital mutilation, or other forms of sexual abuse.
* '''Other abuse:''' Refusal of essential medication, [[humiliation]], etc.
* '''[[Enhanced interrogation]]:''' methods implemented in the [[War on Terror]] purportedly needed to extract information since other techniques would not yield results.
* '''[[Torture]]:''' any act by which severe [[suffering|pain]], whether physical or psychological, is intentionally inflicted

== Psychological abuse ==
===White noise===
The endless playing of random static (similar to that of unused TV frequencies) with no pattern; this can cause extreme discomfort and disorientation.

===Verbal abuse===
Prisoners may be subject to taunting, heckling, profanity, and malicious lies by prison authorities.  Guards and other authorities may use verbal abuse as a means of frightening or demoralizing prisoners to make them more compliant, or simply out of sadism.

===Enablement of Sexual Violence===
Prisoners are sometimes intentionally housed with inmates known to have raped other prisoners, or protection from known rapists may be purposely withheld from the prisoners. These practices create a very high incidence of rape in US prisons, which was the topic of the 2001 report [http://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/prison/  No Escape] from Human Rights Watch.
