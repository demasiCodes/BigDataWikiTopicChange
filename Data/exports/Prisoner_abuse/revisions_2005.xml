==Allegations of prisoner abuse by the U.S. military==

Abuse of prisoners is considered a crime in the [[United States]] [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]].

Some allegations have been made that U.S. or [[Multinational force in Iraq|Coalition]] guards routinely abused prisoners at the [[Abu Ghraib prison]] - even "[[torture]]d" them.

Regarding prisoners held at the [[Guantanamo Bay]], Rep. Duncan Hunter, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, has shown food that is similar to what is served there, "purchased for them by American taxpayers" - in order to dispel allegations that the prisoners had been abused or tortured.

According to Hunter, "They've never eaten better. They've never been treated better. We don't beat them. We don't touch them. We've been treating people well." [http://ap.washingtontimes.com/dynamic/stories/C/CONGRESS_GUANTANAMO?SITE=DCTMS&amp;SECTION=HOME]
