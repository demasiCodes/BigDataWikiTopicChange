'''Prisoner abuse''' is the mistreatment of persons while they are under arrest or incarcerated, therefore deprived of the [[right of self-defense]] against acting authorities and generally defenseless in actual fact.

Abuse falling into this category includes:
* [[Physical abuse]]: Illicit beating and hitting, unlawful [[corporal punishment]], [[stress position]]s, excessive or prolonged [[physical restraints|physical restraining]], etc.
* [[Psychological abuse]]: [[Verbal abuse]], [[sleep deprivation]], [[white noise]], pointless/absurd or [[humiliation|humiliating]] instructions, recurrent exhaustive [[inspection]]s and [[Police raid|shakedowns]], arbitrary [[strip search]]es, denuding actions, exposure, etc.
* [[Sexual abuse]]: Excessive [[body cavity search|vaginal or rectal contraband searches]] or other internal checks, forced [[sexual intercourse]], forced insertion of objects into vagina or rectum, arbitrary [[strip search]]es, denuding actions, etc. (Sexual abuse is thematically widely overlapping with psychological abuse.)
* [[Enhanced interrogation]]: methods implemented in the [[War on Terror]] purportedly needed to extract information from detainees.
* [[Torture]]: any act, whether physical or psychological, which is deliberately done to inflict excruciating and agonizing pain upon a person under the actor's custody or physical control for any reason such as extracting information or punishment.
* Other abuse: Refusal of essential medication, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Prisoner Abuse Law &amp; Legal Definition. ''USLegal''. Retrieved from http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/prisoner-abuse/ &lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychological abuse ==
===White noise===
The endless playing of random static (similar to that of unused TV frequencies) with no pattern; this can cause extreme discomfort and disorientation.

===Verbal abuse===
Prisoners may be subject to taunting, heckling, profanity, and malicious lies by prison authorities.  Guards and other authorities may use verbal abuse as a means of frightening or demoralizing prisoners to make them more compliant, or simply out of sadism.

===Enablement of sexual violence===
Prisoners are sometimes intentionally housed with inmates known to have raped other prisoners, or protection from known rapists may be purposely withheld from the prisoners. These practices create a very high incidence of [[prison rape in the United States|rape in US prisons]], which was the topic of the 2001 report No Escape from Human Rights Watch.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/prison/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Plenary 2 -- Redefining Gender Violence -- Transcripts from Converge!
