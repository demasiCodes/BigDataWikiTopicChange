The notion of "identity" has many uses throughout the social sciences. In [[cognitive psychology]], identity is discussed in terms of whether or not an individual is self-reflective &amp;mdash;i.e. whether it is [[awareness|aware]] of its own identity. 
For example, some papers published in [[2002]] indicated that [[dolphins]] possess the ability to identify themselves in mirrors. Which raises a question being asked in some circles as to whether there exists an environmental identity.

The psychological idea of identity in humans is tied up in [[self image]], namely one's view or model of oneself. Psychologists and counselors interest themselves in psychological identity &amp;mdash;an individual person's sense of self. This is usually referred to as '''personal identity'''. (See also [[identity crisis]] and the work of [[Erik Erikson]].)

== Sociology and Political Theory ==
&lt;!-- This section needs to be rewritten for clarity and accuracy --&gt;
In sociology and political science, the notion of '''social identity''' is individuals' labelling of themselves as members of particular groups -- such as Nation, Social class, Subculture, Ethnicity, Gender, Employment, and so forth. It is in this sense which sociologists and historians speak of a national identity of a particular country, and feminist and queer theorists speak of gender identity.

Many people feel pride in their Identity groups, which furthers a sense of Community and Belonging. Often they will attempt to add to their identity by behaving in certain ways that have only a superficial connection, often the behaviour wasn't even established within the group, but through the Stereotypes of Oppressors. Though, it should not be mistaken that all people who identify a certain way attempt to add more to it. Identity has been a central element of pride movements such as gay pride or black consciousness, which seek to strengthen Politically oppressed groups by improving members' sense of identity. However, many consider a national or ethnic identity as a cultural background for demagogy, ethnic and religious conflicts, and the like.
