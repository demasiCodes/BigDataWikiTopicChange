In [[cognitive psychology]], for example, "identity" refers to the capacity for [[human self-reflection|self-reflection]] and the [[awareness]] of [[self (psychology)|self]] (see [[self-awareness]]).

The psychological idea of identity in humans is related to [[self image]], namely a person's view or [[mental model]] of him or herself, usually known as their '''personal identity''' (see [[identity crisis (psychology)|identity crisis]] and the work of [[Erik Erikson]].)

Sociology recognizes the concept of '''identity negotiation''' where a person has multiple identities that relate to different aspects of their life and personality and "negotiates" with society as to the meaning of that identity in their life.

Amongst animals, research in [[2002]] indicated that [[dolphin]]s possess the ability to identify themselves in mirrors, which raises the question of whether there is an "environmental identity". {{fact}}

== Sociology and political theory ==

&lt;!-- This section needs to be rewritten for clarity and accuracy --&gt;
In sociology and political science, the notion of '''social identity''' is individuals' [[social label|label]]ling of themselves as members of particular [[group (sociology)|groups]] -- such as Nation, Social class, Subculture, Ethnicity, Gender, Employment, and so forth. It is in this sense which sociologists and historians speak of a national identity of a particular country, and [[Feminism|feminist]] and [[Queer theory|queer theorists]] speak of [[gender identity]].

Many people feel pride in their identity groups, which furthers a sense of community and belonging. Often they will attempt to add to their identity by behaving in certain ways that have only a superficial connection, often the behaviour wasn't even established within the group, but through the Stereotypes of Oppressors. Identity has been a central element of pride in [[social movement]]s such as gay pride or black consciousness, which seek to strengthen politically oppressed groups by improving members' sense of identity. However, many consider a national or ethnic identity as a cultural background for demagogy, ethnic and religious conflicts, and the like.

The process of an individual interacting with society relative to an identity is ''identity negotiation.'' The purpose is to develop a consistent set of stimulus/response patterns that reinforce the identity of the person. In general, a person will have to negotiate separately on each identity they possess. For example, the identity of "office worker" would be negotiated separately from the identity of "mother."
