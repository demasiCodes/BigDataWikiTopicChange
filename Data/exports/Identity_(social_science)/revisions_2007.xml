'''Identity''' is an [[umbrella term]] used throughout the [[social sciences]] to describe an individual's comprehension of him or herself as a discrete, separate entity. This term, though generic, can be further specified by the disciplines of [[psychology]] and [[sociology]], including the two forms of [[social psychology]].

==Description==
Identity may be contrasted with the notion of ''self''. In psychology, a ''psychological identity'' relates to [[self-image]] (a person's [[mental model]] of him or herself), [[self-esteem]], and [[individuation]]. An important part of identity in psychology is [[gender identity]], as this dictates to a significant degree how an individual views him or herself both as a person and in relation to other people. In [[cognitive psychology]], the term "identity" refers to the capacity for [[human self-reflection|self-reflection]] and the [[self-awareness|awareness]] of [[self (psychology)|self]].&lt;ref&gt;Leary, M. R., &amp; Tangney, J. P. (2003). [http://books.google.com/books?id=fa4_5xN9c5wC Handbook of self and identity]. New York: Guilford Press. Page 3. ISBN 1572307986&lt;/ref&gt;.

Sociology places some explanatory weight on the concept of [[role]]-behavior. The notion of ''[[identity negotiation]]'' may arise from the learning of social roles through personal experience. Identity negotiation is a process in which a person negotiates with society at large regarding the meaning of his or her identity.

Psychologists most commonly use the term "identity" to describe ''personal identity'', or the idiosyncratic things that make a person unique. Meanwhile, sociologists often use the term to describe ''social identity'', or the collection of group memberships that define the individual. However, these uses are not proprietary, and each discipline may use either concept.

==Identity in psychology==
[[Erik Erikson]] was one of the earliest psychologists to be explicitly interested in identity. The Eriksonian framework rests upon a distinction among the psychological sense of continuity, known as the ''[[ego]] identity'' (sometimes identified simply as "the self"); the personal idiosyncrasies that separate one person from the next, known as the ''personal identity''; and the collection of social roles that a person might play, known as either the ''[[social identity]]'' or the ''[[cultural identity]]''. Erikson's work, in the [[psychodynamic]] tradition, aimed to investigate the process of [[identity formation]] across a lifespan. Progressive strength in the ego identity, for example, can be charted in terms of a series of stages in which identity is formed in response to increasingly sophisticated challenges. On some readings of Erikson, the development of a strong ego identity, along with the proper integration into a stable society and culture, lead to a stronger sense of identity in general. Accordingly, a deficiency in either of these factors may increase the chance of an [[identity crisis]] or confusion. (Cote 2002:17) 

Although the self is distinct from identity, the literature of [[self-psychology]] can offer some insight into how identity is maintained. (Cote 2002:24) From the vantage point of self-psychology, there are two areas of interest: the processes by which a self is formed (the "I"), and the actual content of the [[Schema (psychology)|schemata]] which compose the self-concept (the "Me"). In the latter field, theorists have shown interest in relating the self-concept to [[self-esteem]], the differences between complex and simple ways of organizing self-knowledge, and the links between those organizing principles and the processing of information. (Cote 2002:22)

The "Neo-Eriksonian" ''identity status'' [[paradigm]] emerged in later years, driven largely by the work of [[James Marcia]]. This paradigm focuses upon the twin concepts of ''choice'' and ''commitment''. The central idea is that any individual's sense of identity is determined in large part by the choices and commitments that he or she makes regarding certain personal and social traits. It follows that the core of the research in this paradigm investigates the degrees to which a person has made certain choices, and the degree to which he or she displays a commitment to those choices. 

A person may display either relative weakness or relative strength in terms of both choices and commitments. When assigned categories, four possible permutations result: identity diffusion, identity foreclosure, identity moratorium, and identity achievement. Diffusion is when a person lacks both a sense of having choices in life and interest in committing even to those unchosen roles that he or she occupies. Foreclosure is when a person has not chosen extensively in the past, but seems willing to commit to some relevant values, goals, or roles in the future. Moratorium is when a person displays a kind of flightiness, ready to make choices but unable to commit to them. Finally, achievement is when a person makes identity choices and commits to them.

==Identity in social psychology==
At a general level, [[self-psychology]] is compelled to investigate the question of how the personal self relates to the social environment. To the extent that these theories place themselves in the tradition of [[Social psychology (psychology)|"psychological" social psychology]], they focus on explaining an individual's actions within a group in terms of mental events and states. However, some [[Social psychology (sociology)|"sociological" social psychology]] theories go further by attempting to deal with the issue of identity at both the levels of individual [[cognition]] and of collective behavior.

The question of what psychological reasons drive the individual's adoption of group identities remains open. Many people gain a sense of positive self-esteem from their identity groups, which furthers a sense of [[community]] and belonging. Another issue that researchers have attempted to address is the question of why people engage in [[discrimination]], i.e., why they tend to favor those they consider a part of their "in-group" over those considered to be outsiders. Both questions have been given extensive treatment by [[Henri Tajfel]] and [[John C. Turner]]'s [[social identity theory]]. Their theory focuses mainly on the role of [[self-categorization]] and attempts to show how a simple sense of distinctiveness can lead people to act in a discriminating way. Moreover, social identity theory shows that merely crafting cognitive distinction between in- and out-groups can lead to subtle effects on people's evaluations of others. (Cote 2002:24; Universiteit Twente 2004)

Another issue of interest in social psychology is related to the notion that there are certain ''identity formation strategies'' which a person may use to adapt to the social world. Cote and Levine (2002:3-5) developed a [[typology]] which investigated the different manners of behavior that individuals may have. (3) Their typology includes:

{| border=1 class="prettytable" |
|-
| 
| '''Psychological symptoms'''
| '''Personality symptoms'''
| '''Social symptoms'''

|-
| ''Refuser ''
| Develops cognitive blocks that prevent adoption of adult role-schemas 
| Engages in child-like behavior
| Shows extensive dependency upon others and no meaningful engagement with the community of adults

|-
| ''Drifter ''
| Possesses greater psychological resources than the Refuser (i.e., intelligence, charisma)
| Is apathetic toward application of psychological resources
| Has no meaningful engagement with or commitment to adult communities

|-
| ''Searcher ''
| Has a sense of dissatisfaction due to high personal and social expectations
| Shows disdain for imperfections within the community
| Interacts to some degree with role-models, but ultimately these relationships are abandoned

|-
| ''Guardian ''
| Possesses clear personal values and attitudes, but also a deep fear of change
| Sense of personal identity is almost exhausted by sense of social identity
| Has an extremely rigid sense of social identity and strong identification with adult communities

|-
|'' Resolver ''
| Consciously desires self-growth
| Accepts personal skills and competencies and uses them actively
| Is responsive to communities that provide opportunity for self-growth

|}

[[Kenneth Gergen]] formulated additional classifications, which include the ''strategic manipulator'', the ''pastiche personality'', and the ''relational self''. The strategic manipulator is a person who begins to regard all senses of identity merely as role-playing exercises, and who gradually becomes alienated from his or her social "self". The pastiche personality abandons all aspirations toward a true or "essential" identity, instead viewing social interactions as opportunities to play out, and hence become, the roles they play. Finally, the relational self is a perspective by which persons abandon all sense of exclusive self, and view all sense of identity in terms of social engagement with others. For Gergen, these strategies follow one another in phases, and they are linked to the increase in popularity of [[postmodern]] culture and the rise of telecommunications technology.

==Identity in sociology==

In sociology and [[political science]], the notion of social identity is defined as the way that individuals [[social label|label]] themselves as members of particular [[group (sociology)|groups]] (e.g., [[nation]], [[social class]], [[subculture]], [[ethnicity]], [[gender]], etc.). It is in this sense that sociologists and [[historian]]s speak of the [[national identity]] of a particular country, and [[Feminism|feminist]] and [[Queer theory|queer]] theorists speak of [[gender identity]]. [[Symbolic interactionism]] (SI) attempts to show how identity can influence, and be influenced by, social reality at large. SI is based largely on the work of the [[American pragmatism|American pragmatists]], such as [[Charles Peirce]] and [[William James]]. (Cote 2002:32)

SI has two schools of thought: the Iowa School and the Chicago School. SI researchers in the [[Chicago School]] argue that social reality is emergent and is constructed from personal, "situated" [[interaction]], i.e., from the process of [[impression management]]. To observe identity scientifically, the Chicago school opts for [[ethnomethodology]] and qualitative observation techniques. [[Iowa School]] researchers attempt to show that personal and social identities are representations of, or are otherwise connected to, [[social structure]]s, and tend to use quantitative surveys. For example, McCall and Simmons make use of the notion of [[role-identity]], and Sheldon Stryker's theory of [[structural interactionism]] explains identity in terms of ''interaction density'' and ''interaction opportunities''. (Cote 2002:35-36) Of particular concern to sociologists who subscribe to the theories of [[Émile Durkheim]] is the question of how [[social phenomena]] such as mass [[anomie]] relate to the identity formation strategies.

Identity has played a functional role in [[social movement]]s. By emphasizing a group identity, social movements have sought to strengthen politically oppressed groups both by improving members' sense of confidence and by familiarizing the external society with the existing social group. However, national or ethnic identity is sometimes also tied to demagogy, leading to ethnic or religious conflicts. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Based on ''identity theory'' as rooted in the work of [[George Herbert Mead]] (1934) and expanded by [[Sheldon Stryker]] (1968), the process of the individual interacting with others in order to create an identity is called ''[[identity negotiation]].'' The purpose of identity negotiation is to develop a consistent set of behaviors that reinforce the identity of the person. In general, a person will have to negotiate separately on each identity he or she possesses by interacting with those who are affected by the role in question. For example, a person's identity as "office worker" would be negotiated separately from her identity as "mother", because the collectively established role of the worker involves negotiation with coworkers, and not (directly) with one's children. See Stryker and Burke (2000). A related notion is that of [[identity capital]], developed by Cote &amp; Levine (2002).

===Identity and historical sociology===

In sociology, social identity can also be examined from the perspective of social and historical change. Postmodern views of identity understand it as a function of historical and cultural circumstances. Some works, like that of Berger and Luckmann, argue that all aspects of social reality are actually social constructions created by historical facts. Nevertheless, they emphasize that these constructs have real consequences upon the lives and behaviors of human beings. (Cote 2002:37)

Kenneth Gergen and [[Anthony Giddens]] have both attempted to place theories of identity formation in a historical context. Gergen argues that changes in popular types of identity have run parallel to a change in broader culture: a sense of robust ego identity was present in the romantic period, followed by a sense of self as rational actor during the [[modernist]] period, and the sense of a relational self was typical of the postmodern period. In contrast, Giddens accepts that there is historical change in identity styles, but attributes it to aberrations in socio-economic conditions which are unique to the "high modern" period. (Cote 2002:42-43)

In any case, the concept that an individual has a unique identity developed relatively late in history. Factors influencing the emphasis on personal identity may include:

* In the West, the [[Protestant]] stress on one's [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] for one's own soul;
* [[Psychology]] itself, emerging as a distinct field of knowledge and speculation;
* The growth of a sense of [[privacy]];
* Specialization of worker roles during the industrial period (as opposed, for example, to the undifferentiated roles of peasants in the [[feudal]] system);
* Occupation and employment's effect on identity; {{Fact|date=June 2007}}
* Increased emphasis on gender identity, including [[gender identity disorder]] and [[transgender]] issues. {{Fact|date=June 2007}}
