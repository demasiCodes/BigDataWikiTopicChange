{{Feminism sidebar}}
The term '''women's rights''' refers to [[Freedom (political)|freedoms]] and entitlements of women and girls of all ages. These rights may or may not be institutionalized, ignored or suppressed by law, local custom, and behavior in a particular society. These liberties are grouped together and differentiated from broader notions of [[human rights]] because they often differ from the freedoms inherently possessed by or recognized for men and boys, and because activists for this issue claim an inherent historical and traditional bias against the exercise of rights by women and girls.&lt;ref name=Hosken&gt; Hosken, Fran P., 'Towards a Definition of Women's Rights' in ''Human Rights Quarterly'', Vol. 3, No. 2. (May, 1981), pp. 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues commonly associated with notions of women's rights include, though are not limited to, the right: to bodily integrity and autonomy; to [[Women's suffrage|vote]] (suffrage); to hold public office; to work; to fair wages or equal pay; to own property; [[Right to education|to education]]; to serve in the military or be conscripted; to enter into legal [[contracts]]; and to have marital, parental and religious rights.&lt;ref name=quarterly&gt; Lockwood, Bert B. (ed.), ''Women's Rights: A "Human Rights Quarterly" Reader'' (John Hopkins University Press, 2006), ISBN 9780801883743&lt;/ref&gt; Women and their supporters have campaigned and in some places continue to campaign for the same rights as men.&lt;ref name=quarterly/&gt;

==History==
{{details| Legal rights of women in history}}
{{details| Timeline of Womens Rights (other than voting)}}
According to Dr. Jamal A. Badawin "the status which women reached during the present era was not achieved due to the kindness of men or due to natural progress. It was rather achieved through a long struggle and sacrifice on woman's part and only when society needed her contribution and work, more especial!; during the two world wars, and due to the escalation of technological change."&lt;ref name="badawi" /&gt;

=== Ancient civilisations ===
[[Hindu scriptures]] describe a good wife as follows "a woman whose mind, speech and body are kept in subjection, acquires high renown in this world, and, in the next, the same abode with her husband." In [[ancient Athens]] women were always minors and subject to a male, such as their father, brother or some other male kin. A women's consent in marriage was not generally thought to be necessary and women were obliged to submit to the wishes of her parents or husband. In [[ancient Rome]] a wife was considered "a minor, a ward, a person incapable of doing or acting anything according to her own individual taste, a person continually under the tutelage and guardianship of her husband." Under Roman Law a woman and her property passed into the power of her husband upon marriage. The wife was considered the purchased [[property]] of her husband, acquired only for his benefit. Furthermore [[women in Ancient Rome]] could not exercise any civil or public office, and could not act as witness, surety, tutor, or curator. Women were also not allowed to make a will or [[contract]].&lt;ref name=badawi&gt;{{citation|last=Dr. Badawi|first=Jamal A.|title=The Status of Women in Islam|journal=Al-Ittihad Journal of Islamic Studies|volume=8|issue=2|date=September 1971|url=http://iaislam.tripod.com/TSOWII.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early reforms under Islam ===
{{See|Early reforms under Islam|Sex segregation and Islam}}
Effort to improve the status of [[women in Islam]] occurred during the early reforms under Islam between 610 and 661, when women were given greater rights in [[marriage]], [[divorce]] and [[Islamic inheritance jurisprudence|inheritance]].&lt;ref name="Espos"&gt;Esposito (2005) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; In 622 the [[Constitution of Medina]] was drafted by the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], outlining many of [[Muhammad]]'s [[early reforms under Islam]], including an improved [[Sharia|legal status]] for [[women in Islam]], who were generally given greater rights than women in [[pre-Islamic Arabia]]&lt;ref name="Espos"&gt; [[John Esposito]], ''Islam: The Straight Path'' p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="majid"&gt; [[Majid Khadduri]], ''Marriage in Islamic Law: The Modernist Viewpoints'', American Journal of [[Comparative law|Comparative Law]], Vol. 26, No. 2, pp. 213-218&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]].&lt;ref&gt; Encyclopedia of religion, second edition, Lindsay Jones, p.6224, ISBN 0-02-865742-X&lt;/ref&gt; Women were not accorded with such legal status in other cultures until centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay Jones, p.6224&lt;/ref&gt;

The general improvement of the status of [[Arab]] women included prohibition of [[female infanticide]] and recognizing women's full personhood.&lt;ref name="OxfordDicT"&gt;Esposito (2004), p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; "The [[dowry]], previously regarded as a [[bride price|bride-price]] paid to the father, became a nuptial gift retained by the wife as part of her personal property."&lt;ref name="Espos" /&gt;&lt;ref name="majid"&gt;Khadduri (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Sharia|Islamic law]], marriage was no longer viewed as a "status" but rather as a "[[contract]]", in which the woman's consent was imperative.&lt;ref name="Espos" /&gt;&lt;ref name="majid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OxfordDicT" /&gt; "Women were given inheritance rights in a [[patriarchal society]] that had previously restricted inheritance to male relatives."&lt;ref name="Espos" /&gt; [[Annemarie Schimmel]] states that "compared to the pre-Islamic position of women, [[Fiqh|Islamic legislation]] meant an enormous progress; the woman has the right, at least according to the [[Letter and spirit of the law|letter of the law]], to administer the wealth she has brought into the family or has earned by her own work."&lt;ref name = "Schimmel"&gt;Schimmel (1992) p.65&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Professor [[William Montgomery Watt]], when seen in such historical context, [[Muhammad]] "can be seen as a figure who testified on behalf of women’s rights."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alastairmcintosh.com/articles/2000_watt.htm Interview with Prof William Montgomery Watt]&lt;/ref&gt; During his life, [[Muhammad's wives|Muhammad married eleven or thirteen women]] depending upon the differing accounts of who were his wives.&lt;ref name = Haykal&gt;[[Muhammad Husayn Haykal]].

=== The Middle Ages ===
According to [[English Common Law]], which developed from the 12th Century onward all property which a wife held at the time of a marriage became a possession of her husband. Eventually English courts forbid a husband's transferring property without the consent of his wife, but he still retained the right to manage it and to receive the money which it produced.&lt;ref name="badawi" /&gt; "French married women suffered from restrictions on their legal capacity which were removed only in 1965."&lt;ref name=Badr-1984&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Criminal Justice|first=Gamal M.|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=32|issue=1|date=Winter 1984|pages=167–169 [[167–8]]|doi=10.2307/840274}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th century, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in Europe allowed more women to add their voices, including the English writers [[Jane Anger]], [[Emilia Lanier|Aemilia Lanyer]], and the prophetess [[Anna Trapnell]]. Despite relatively greater freedom for [[Anglo-Saxon women]], until the mid-nineteenth century, writers largely assumed that a [[Patriarchy|patriarchal order]] was a natural order that had existed.&lt;ref name="Maine"&gt;Maine, Henry Sumner. Ancient Law 1861&lt;/ref&gt; This perception was not seriously challenged until the eighteenth century when [[Jesuit]] missionaries found [[matrilineality]] in native North American peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph-François Lafitau|Lafitau, Joseph François]], cited by Campbell, Joseph in, Myth, religion, and mother-right: selected writings of JJ Bachofen.

=== The Enlightenment ===

In the late 18th Century the question of women's rights became central to political debates in both France and Britain. At the time some of the greatest thinkers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], who defended democratic principles of [[equality]] and challenged notions that a privileged few should rule over the vast majority of the population, believed that these principles should be applied only to their own gender and their own race. The philosopher [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] for example thought that it was the order of nature for woman to obey men. He wrote "Women do wrong to complain of the inequality of man-made laws" and claimed that "when she tries to usurp our rights, she is our inferior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Lauren| first = Paul Gordon| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The evolution of international human rights: visions seen| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| date = 2003| location =| pages = 29 &amp; 30| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=gHRhWgbWyzMC&amp;dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Man+and+of+the+Citizen&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| doi =| id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1791 the French playwright and political [[Activism|activist]] [[Olympe de Gouges]] published the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'',&lt;ref name=MS1112&gt;Macdonald and Scherf, "Introduction", 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; modelled on the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] of 1789. The Declaration is ironic in formulation and exposes the failure of the [[French Revolution]], which had been devoted to [[equality]]. It states that: “This revolution will only take effect when all women become fully aware of their deplorable condition, and of the rights they have lost in society”. The Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen follows the seventeen articles of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] point for point and has been described by Camille Naish as “almost a parody... of the original document”. The first article of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen proclaims that “Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be based only on common utility.” The first article of Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen replied: “Woman is born free and remains equal to man in rights. Social distinctions may only be based on common utility”. De Gouges expands the sixth article of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which declared the rights of citizens to take part in the formation of law, to: 
[[File:Women suffrage cartoon.png|thumb|left|Australian women's rights were lampooned in this 1887 ''Melbourne Punch'' cartoon: A hypothetical female member foists her baby's care on the House Speaker]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“All citizens including women are equally admissible to all public dignities, offices and employments, according to their capacity, and with no other distinction than that of their virtues and talents”. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
De Gouges also draws attention to the fact that under French law women were fully punishable, yet denied equal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Death comes to the maiden: Sex and Execution, 1431-1933 |last=Naish |first=Camille |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn= 978-0415055857 |page=137 |pages= |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OHYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Woman+and+the+Female+Citizen&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 19th Century ===
In his 1869 essay [[The Subjection of Women]] the [[English people|English]] philosopher and political theorist [[John Stuart Mill]] described the situation for women in Britain as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We are continually told that civilization and Christianity have restored to the woman her just rights. Meanwhile the wife is the actual bondservant of her husband; no less so, as far as the legal obligation goes, than slaves commonly so called."&lt;ref name="badawi" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the 1800s women in the United States and Britain began to challenge laws that denied them the right to their property once they married. Under the common law doctrine of ''[[coverture]]'' husbands gained control of their wives' real estate and wages. Beginning in the 1840s, state legislatures in the United States&lt;ref&gt;http://womenshistory.about.com/od/marriedwomensproperty/a/property_1848ny.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the British Parliament&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umd.umich.edu/casl/hum/eng/classes/434/geweb/PROPERTY.htm&lt;/ref&gt; began passing statutes that protected women's property from their husbands and their husbands' creditors. These laws were known as the Married Women's Property Acts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/366305/Married-Womens-Property-Acts&lt;/ref&gt; Courts in the nineteenth-century United States also continued to require privy examinations of married women who sold their property.  A [[privy examination]] was a practice in which a married woman who wished to sell her property had to be separately examined by a judge or justice of the peace outside of the presence of her husband and asked if her husband was pressuring her into signing the document.&lt;ref&gt;http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_womens_history/v012/12.2braukman.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suffrage, the right to vote==

{{details|Women's suffrage}}
During the 19th Century women began to agitate for the [[right to vote]] and participate in government and law making.&lt;ref name=Krolokke&gt; Krolokke, Charlotte and Anne Scott Sorensen, 'From Suffragettes to Grrls' in Gender Communication Theories and Analyses:From Silence to Performance (Sage, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The ideals of [[women's suffrage]] developed alongside that of [[universal suffrage]] and today women's suffrage is considered a right (under the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]]).{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} During the 19th Century the right to vote was gradually extended in many countries and women started to campaign for their right to vote. In 1893 New Zealand became the first country to give women the right to vote on a national level. Australia gave women the right to vote in 1902, while the USA, Britain and Canada gave women the vote after the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name=suffrage&gt;{{cite web |title=Women's Suffrage |url=http://content.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=5193 |date= |work= |publisher=Scholastic |accessdate=20 July 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sweden]] would also be a contestant as the first independent nation to grant women the right to vote.  Conditional female suffrage was granted in Sweden during the [[age of liberty]] (1718&amp;ndash;1771)&lt;ref name="Karlsson-Sjögren 1866"&gt;* Åsa Karlsson-Sjögren: ''Männen, kvinnorna och rösträtten : medborgarskap och representation 1723&amp;ndash;1866'' (Men, women and the vote: citizenship and representation 1723&amp;ndash;1866) (in Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain women's suffrage gained attention when [[John Stuart Mill]] called for the inclusion of women's suffrage in the Reform Act of 1867 in a petition that he presented to Parliament.&lt;ref name=suffrage/&gt; Initially only one of several women’s rights campaign, suffrage became the primary cause of the British women’s movement at the beginning of the 20th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The women’s suffrage movement in Britain, 1866-1928 |last=Van Wingerden |first=Sophia A. |year=1999 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location= |isbn= 0312218532 |page= |pages=1-2 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=0oLxK_NHI6kC&amp;printsec=frontcover |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the ability to vote was restricted to wealthy [[Property law|property owners]] within [[Great Britain|British]] jurisdictions. This arrangement implicitly excluded women as [[property law]] and [[marriage law]] gave men ownership rights at marriage or inheritance until the 19th century. Although male suffrage broadened during the century, women were explicitly prohibited from voting nationally and locally in the 1830s by a [[1832 Reform Act|Reform Act]] and the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835|Municipal Corporations Act]].&lt;ref name=X&gt; Phillips, Melanie, The Ascent of Woman: A History of the Suffragette Movement (Abacus, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 19th century women had organised through various groups until, by 1903, the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] and the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] had emerged. Leaders in the struggle were [[Millicent Fawcett]] and [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] with her daughter [[Christabel Pankhurst|Christabel]]. In 1918 the [[British Parliament]] passed a bill allowing women over the age of 30 to vote, and the voting age for women was lowered to 21 in 1928.&lt;ref name="X" /&gt;

The [[Seneca Falls Convention]] of 1848 formulated the demand for [[women's suffrage]] in the [[United States of America]] and after the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865) agitation for the cause became more prominent. In 1869 the proposed [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which gave the vote to black men, caused controversy as women's suffrage campaigners such as [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] refused to endorse the amendment, as it did not give the vote to women. Others, such as [[Lucy Stone]] and [[Julia Ward Howe]] however argued that black men were enfranchised, women would achieve their goal. The conflict caused two organisations to emerge, the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]], which campaigned for women's suffrage at a federal level as well as for married women to be given property rights, and the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]], which aimed to secure women's suffrage through state legislation. In 1920 the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] gave women the right to vote.&lt;ref name=suffrage/&gt;

[[Image:Poster23.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Soviet poster celebrates women's right to vote and to be elected.]]
[[Nordic countries]] gave women the right to vote in the early 20th Century – [[Finland]] (1906), [[Norway]] (1913), [[Denmark]] and [[Iceland]] (1915). With the end of the [[First World War]] many other countries followed - the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] and the [[Netherlands]] (1917), [[Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Poland]] and [[Sweden]] (1918), [[Germany]] and [[Lunenburg]] (1919). [[Spain]] gave women the right to vote in 1931, [[France]] in 1944, [[Belgium]], [[Italy]], [[Romania]] and [[Yugoslavia]] in 1946. [[Switzerland]] only gave women the right to vote in 1971, and [[Lichtenstein]] in 1984.&lt;ref name=suffrage/&gt;

In [[Canada]] women's suffrage was achieved first on a provincial level in [[Alberta]], [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]] on 1916, with federal suffrage being granted in 1918. In [[Latin America]] some countries gave women the right to vote in the first half of the 20th Century – [[Ecuador]] (1929), [[Brazil]] (1932), [[El Salvador]] (1939), [[Dominican Republic]] (1942), [[Guatemala]] (1956) and [[Argentina]] (1946). In [[India]], under colonial rule, universal suffrage was granted in 1935. Other [[Asia]]n countries gave women the right to vote in mid of the Century – [[Japan]] (1945), [[China]] (1947) and [[Indonesia]] (1955). In [[Africa]] women generally got the right to vote along with men through [[universal suffrage]] – [[Liberia]] (1947), [[Uganda]] (1958) and [[Nigeria]] (1960). In many countries in the [[Middle East]] [[universal suffrage]] was acquired after the [[Second World War]], although in others, such as [[Kuwait]], suffrage is very limited and still excludes women.&lt;ref name=suffrage/&gt;

==Modern movement==

[[Image:Zainab Salbi.jpg|thumb|Iraqi-American writer and activist [[Zainab Salbi]], the founder of [[Women for Women International]].]]
In the subsequent decades women's rights again became an important issue in the English speaking world. By the 1960s the movement was called "[[feminism]]" or "women's liberation." Reformers wanted the same pay as men, equal rights in law, and the freedom to plan their families or not have children at all. Their efforts were met with mixed results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jofreeman.com/feminism/suffrage.htm|title=www.jofreeman.com/feminism/suffrage.htm&lt;!--INSERT TITLE--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, a public groundswell of opinion in favour of legal equality had gained pace, partly through the extensive employment of women in what were traditional male roles during both world wars. By the 1960s the legislative process was being readied, tracing through MP [[Willie Hamilton]]'s [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]] report, his Equal Pay For Equal Work Bill, the creation of a Sex Discrimination Board, [[Lady Sear]]'s draft sex anti-discrimination bill, a government [[Green Paper]] of 1973, until 1975 when the first British Sex Discrimination Act, an Equal Pay Act, and an [[Equal Opportunities Commission]] came into force.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, 29 December 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 29 December 29 1975 "Sex discrimination in advertising banned"&lt;/ref&gt; With encouragement from the UK government, the other countries of the [[EEC]] soon followed suit with an agreement to ensure that discrimination laws would be phased out across the European Community.

In the USA, the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) was created in 1966 with the purpose of bringing about equality for all women. NOW was one important group that fought for the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA). This amendment stated that "equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of [[gender|sex]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.now.org/history/purpos66.html|title=The National Organization for Women's 1966 Statement of Purpose&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; But there was disagreement on how the proposed amendment would be understood. Supporters believed it would guarantee women equal treatment. But critics feared it might deny women the right be financially supported by their husbands. The amendment died in 1982 because not enough states had ratified it. ERAs have been included in subsequent Congresses, but have still failed to be ratified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/national-organization-for-women?cat=biz-fin&amp;nr=1|title=National Organization for Women: Definition and Much More from Answers.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last three decades of the 20th century, Western women knew a new freedom through [[birth control]], which enabled women to plan their adult lives, often making way for both career and family. The movement had been started in the 1910s by US pioneering social reformer [[Margaret Sanger]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1676.html|title=Margaret Sanger&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the UK and internationally by [[Marie Stopes]].

Over the course of the 20th century women took on greater roles in society such as serving in government. In the United States some served as [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]] and others as members of the [[United States Cabinet|U.S. Cabinet]]. Many women took advantage of opportunities in higher education. In the United States at the beginning of the 20th century less than 20% of all college degrees were earned by women. By the end of the century this figure had risen to about 50%.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wic.org/misc/history.htm|title=WIC - Women's History in America&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Progress was made in professional opportunities. Fields such as medicine, law, and science opened to include more women. At the beginning of the 20th century about 5% of the doctors in the United States were women. As of 2006, over 38% of all doctors in the United States were women, and today, women make almost 50% of the medical student population. While the numbers of women in these fields increased, many women still continued to hold clerical, factory, retail, or service jobs. For example, they worked as office assistants, on assembly lines, or as cooks.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/16229.html|title=www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/16229.html&lt;!--INSERT TITLE--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The United Nations and womens' rights ==
In 1946 the [[United Nations]] established a [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women|Commission on the Status of Women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/Review/|title=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs.

=== Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ===
{{main|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women}}
[[Image:CEDAW Participation.svg|right|400px|thumb| Participation in the CEDAW {{Col-begin}}{{Col-2}}{{legend|#00aa00|Signed and ratified}}{{legend|#008000|Acceded or succeeded}}{{legend|#008080|Unrecognized state, abiding by treaty}}{{Col-2}}{{legend|#eeee00|Only signed}}{{legend|#ff1111|Non-signatory}}{{Col-end}}]]

The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted in 1948, enshrines "the equal rights of men and women", and addressed both the equality and equity issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1979 the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). Described as an international [[bill of rights]] for [[woman|women]], it came into force on 3 September 1981. The [[United States]] is the only developed nation that has not ratified the CEDAW.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The Convention defines discrimination against women in the following terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It also establishes an agenda of action for putting an end to sex-based discrimination for which states ratifying the Convention are required to enshrine [[gender equality]] into their domestic legislation, repeal all discriminatory provisions in their laws, and enact new provisions to guard against discrimination against women. They must also establish tribunals and public institutions to guarantee women effective protection against discrimination, and take steps to eliminate all forms of discrimination practiced against women by individuals, organizations, and enterprises.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

===Maputo Protocol===
{{main|Maputo Protocol}}
The Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa, better known as the [[Maputo Protocol]], was adopted by the [[African Union]] on 11 July 2003 at its second summit in [[Maputo]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0307/S00279.htm African Union: Rights of Women Protocol Adopted], press release, [[Amnesty International]], 22 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Mozambique]].  On 25 November 2005, having been ratified by the required 15 member nations of the African Union, the protocol entered into force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0602/S00099.htm UNICEF: toward ending female genital mutilation], press release, [[United Nations Children's Fund|UNICEF]], 7 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol guarantees comprehensive rights to women including the right to take part in the political process, to social and political [[sexual equality|equality]] with men, and to control of their [[reproductive health]], and an end to [[female genital cutting|female genital mutilation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gtz.de/de/dokumente/en-fgm-maputoprotocol.pdf The Maputo Protocol of the African Union], brochure produced by [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit|GTZ]] for the German [[Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (Germany)|Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproductive rights==
{{main|Reproductive rights}}
Reproductive rights are rights relating to [[sexual reproduction]] and [[reproductive health]].&lt;ref name="COOK"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cook |first=Rebecca J. |coauthors=Mahmoud F.

Reproductive rights are understood as rights of both men and women, but are most frequently advanced as women's rights. The [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNPF) and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) advocate for reproductive rights with a primary emphasis on women's rights. The idea of these rights were first discussed as a subset of human rights at the United Nation's 1968 International Conference on Human Rights. The sixteenth article of the Proclamation of Teheran recognises [[reproductive rights]] as a subset of [[human rights]] and states, "Parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and the spacing of their children."&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Freedman |first=Lynn P. |coauthors=Stephen L.

== Abortion ==
{{main|Abortion}}
Women's access to safe and legal [[abortion]]s is restricted in law or in practice in most countries in the world. Even where [[abortion]] is permitted by law, women may only have limited access to safe abortion services. Only a small number of countries prohibit abortion in all cases. In most countries and jurisdictions, abortion is allowed to save the pregnant woman's life, or where the pregnancy is the result of [[rape]] or [[incest]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/women/abortion.html|title=www.hrw.org/women/abortion.html&lt;!--INSERT TITLE--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] considers [[abortion]] within the context of [[human rights]], arguing: 
:"Abortion is a highly emotional subject and one that excites deeply held opinions. However, equitable access to safe abortion services is first and foremost a human right. Where abortion is safe and legal, no one is forced to have one. Where abortion is illegal and unsafe, women are forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term or suffer serious health consequences and even death. Approximately 13% of maternal deaths worldwide are attributable to unsafe abortion—between 68,000 and 78,000 deaths annually."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; 
Furthermore, they argue that "...international human rights legal instruments and authoritative interpretations of those instruments compel the conclusion that women have a right to decide independently in all matters related to reproduction, including the issue of abortion."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Human Rights Watch argues that "the denial of a pregnant woman's right to make an independent decision regarding abortion violates or poses a threat to a wide range of human rights." Basing its analysis on the authoritative interpretations of international human rights instruments by UN expert bodies Human Rights Watch states that where women's access to safe and legal abortion services are restricted, the following [[human rights]] may be at risk: the [[right to life]], the [[right to health]] (or health care), right to [[freedom from discrimination]], right to [[security of person]], the [[right to liberty]], the [[right to privacy]], the [[right to information]], the right to be free from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment , the right to decide the number and spacing of children ([[reproductive rights]]), the right to [[freedom of thought]], and the right to [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/americas/argentina0605/|title=www.hrw.org/backgrounder/americas/argentina0605/&lt;!--INSERT TITLE--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/americas/argentina0605/#issue|title=www.hrw.org/backgrounder/americas/argentina0605/#issue&lt;!--INSERT TITLE--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other groups however, such as the [[Catholic Church]], regard abortion not as a right but as a 'moral evil'.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church 2271.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Rape|War rape}}
Rape, sometimes called [[sexual assault]], is an [[assault]] by a person involving [[sexual intercourse]] with or [[sexual penetration]] of another person without that person's [[consent]]. Rape is generally considered a serious [[sex crime]] as well as a civil assault. When part of a widespread and systematic practice [[rape]] and [[sexual slavery]] are now recognised as [[crime against humanity]] and [[war crime]]. Rape is also now recognised as an element of the crime of [[genocide]] when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted group.

=== Rape as an element of the crime of genocide ===
{{main|Rwandan genocide}}
In 1998, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] established by the [[United Nations]] made landmark decisions that [[rape]] is a crime of [[genocide]] under [[international law]]. The trial of [[Jean-Paul Akayesu]], the mayor of Taba Commune in [[Rwanda]], established precedents that [[rape]] is an element of the crime of genocide. The Akayesu judgement includes the first interpretation and application by an international court of the 1948 [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]]. The Trial Chamber held that rape, which it defined as "a physical invasion of a sexual nature committed on a person under circumstances which are coercive", and sexual assault constitute acts of genocide insofar as they were committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted group, as such. It found that sexual assault formed an integral part of the process of destroying the [[Tutsi]] ethnic group and that the rape was systematic and had been perpetrated against Tutsi women only, manifesting the specific intent required for those acts to constitute genocide.&lt;ref name=unreport&gt;Fourth Annual Report of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] to the General Assembly (September, 1999), accessed at [http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/annualreports/a54/9925571e.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;  

Judge [[Navanethem Pillay]] said in a statement after the verdict: “From time immemorial, rape has been regarded as [[spoils of war]]. Now it will be considered a war crime. We want to send out a strong message that rape is no longer a trophy of war.”&lt;ref name=paulwalters&gt;[[Navanethem Pillay]] is quoted by Professor Paul Walters in his presentation of her honorary [[doctorate of law]], [[Rhodes University]], April 2005 [http://www.ru.ac.za/academic/graduation/addresses_and_citations/2005/Judge_Pillay_citation.doc]&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 500,000 women were raped during the 1994 Rwandan Genocide.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.amnesty.org.nz/web/pages/home.nsf/0/e57ea3f05f6aa848cc256e460012f365?OpenDocument Violence Against Women: Worldwide Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rape and sexual enslavement as crime against humanity ===
{{main|Crimes against humanity}}
The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]] Explanatory Memorandum, which defines the jurisdiction of the [[International Criminal Court]], recognises [[rape]], [[sexual slavery]], [[enforced prostitution]], forced pregnancy, [[compulsory sterilization|enforced sterilization]], "or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity" as [[Crimes against humanity|crime against humanity]] if the action is part of a widespread or systematic practice.&lt;ref name="Horton"&gt; As quoted by Guy Horton in ''[http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs3/Horton-2005.pdf Dying Alive - A Legal Assessment of Human Rights Violations in Burma]'' April 2005, co-Funded by The Netherlands Ministry for Development Co-Operation. See section "12.52 Crimes against humanity", Page 201. He references RSICC/C, Vol. 1 p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape was first recognised as [[crime against humanity]] when the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] issued arrest warrants based on the [[Geneva Conventions]] and Violations of the Laws or Customs of War. Specifically, it was recognised that Muslim women in [[Foca]] (southeastern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]) were subjected to systematic and widespread [[gang rape]], torture and [[sexual enslavement]] by [[Bosnian Serb]] soldiers, policemen, and members of paramilitary groups after the takeover of the city in April 1992.&lt;ref name=autogenerated17&gt;[http://www.haverford.edu/relg/sells/rape.html Rape as a Crime Against Humanity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The indictment was of major legal significance and was the first time that sexual assaults were investigated for the purpose of prosecution under the rubric of [[torture]] and [[enslavement]] as a crime against humanity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated17 /&gt; The indictment was confirmed by a 2001 verdict by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] that [[rape]] and [[sexual enslavement]] are [[crimes against humanity]]. This ruling challenged the widespread acceptance of rape and sexual enslavement of women as intrinsic part of war.&lt;ref name=AmnestyInt2001feb22&gt; [http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR630042001?open&amp;of=ENG-BIH Bosnia-Herzegovina : Foca verdict - rape and sexual enslavement are crimes against humanity]. [[22 February]] 2001. [[Amnesty International]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] found three Bosnian Serb men guilty of [[rape]] of [[Bosniac]] (Bosnian Muslim) women and girls (some as young as 12 and 15 years of age), in [[Foca]], eastern [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]]. Furthermore two of the men were found guilty of the crime against humanity of [[sexual enslavement]] for holding women and girls captive in a number of de facto detention centres. Many of the women subsequently [[disappeared]].&lt;ref name=AmnestyInt2001feb22/&gt;
