{{Rights}}

'''Women's rights''' are the [[rights]] and [[entitlement]]s claimed for [[women]] and [[girl]]s worldwide, and which formed the basis for the women's rights movement in the 19th century and [[feminist movement]] during the 20th century. In some countries, these rights are institutionalized or supported by law, local custom, and behavior, whereas in others they are ignored and suppressed. They differ from broader notions of [[human rights]] through claims of an inherent historical and traditional bias against the exercise of rights by women and girls, in favor of men and boys.&lt;ref name="Hosken"&gt;Hosken, Fran P., 'Towards a Definition of Women's Rights' in ''Human Rights Quarterly'', Vol. 3, No. 2. (May 1981), pp. 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues commonly associated with notions of women's rights include the right to bodily integrity and [[autonomy]]; to be free from [[sexual violence]]; to [[Women's suffrage|vote]]; to hold public office; to enter into legal contracts; to have equal rights in [[family law]]; [[Right to work|to work]]; to fair wages or [[Equal pay for equal work|equal pay]]; to have [[reproductive rights]]; to [[Right to property|own property]]; [[Right to education|to education]].&lt;ref name=quarterly&gt;Lockwood, Bert B.

In ancient Egypt, women enjoyed the same rights under the law as a man, however rightful entitlements depended upon [[social class]]. Landed property descended in the female line from mother to daughter, and women were entitled to administer their own property. Women in ancient Egypt could buy, sell, be a partner in [[legal contract]]s, be executor in wills and witness to legal documents, bring court action, and adopt children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joshua J.

Although most women lacked political and equal rights in the [[city states]] of ancient Greece, they enjoyed a certain freedom of movement until the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic age]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women of Ancient Greece|last = Nardo|first = Don|publisher = Lucent Books|year = 2000|location = San Diego|page = 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records also exist of women in ancient [[Delphi]], [[Gortyn]], [[Thessaly]], [[Megara]] and [[Sparta]] owning land, the most prestigious form of [[private property]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gerhard| first = Ute| title = Debating women's equality: toward a feminist theory of law from a European perspective| publisher = Rutgers University Press| year = 2001| page = 33| url = https://books.google.com/?id=XMohyLfGDDsC&amp;dq=women+right+to+property| isbn = 978-0-8135-2905-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the Archaic age, legislators began to enact laws enforcing gender segregation, resulting in decreased rights for women.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

[[Women in Classical Athens]] had no legal personhood and were assumed to be part of the ''[[oikos]]'' headed by the male ''[[Kurios|kyrios]]''. Until marriage, women were under the guardianship of their father or other male relative. Once married, the husband became a woman's ''kyrios''. As women were barred from conducting legal proceedings, the ''kyrios'' would do so on their behalf.&lt;ref name="google114"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Blundell| first =Sue| title = Women in ancient Greece, Volume 1995, Part 2| publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 1995| page = 114| url = https://books.google.com/?id=Xfx1VaSIOgQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=women+ancient+greece#v=onepage&amp;q=women%20athens&amp;f=false| isbn = 978-0-674-95473-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Athenian women could only acquire rights over [[property]] through gifts, dowry and inheritance, though her ''kyrios'' had the right to dispose of a woman's property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Blundell| first =Sue| title = Women in ancient Greece, Volume 1995, Part 2| publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 1995| page = 115| url = https://books.google.com/?id=Xfx1VaSIOgQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=women+ancient+greece#v=onepage&amp;q=women%20athens&amp;f=false| isbn = 978-0-674-95473-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Athenian women could only enter into a contract worth less than the value of a "''[[medimno]]s'' of barley" (a measure of grain), allowing women to engage in petty trading.&lt;ref name="google114"/&gt; Women were excluded from ancient [[Athenian democracy]], both in principle and in practice.

This separation would entail living in a room called a ''[[gynaeceum|gynaikeion]]'', while looking after the duties in the home and having very little exposure with the male world. This was also to ensure that wives only had legitimate children from their husbands. Athenian women received little education, except home tutorship for basic skills such as spin, weave, cook and some knowledge of money.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although [[Spartan]] women were formally excluded from military and political life they enjoyed considerable status as mothers of Spartan warriors. As men engaged in military activity, women took responsibility for running estates. Following protracted warfare in the 4th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC Spartan women-owned approximately between 35% and 40% of all Spartan land and property.&lt;ref name="Pomeroy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Tierney| first = Helen| title = Women's studies encyclopaedia, Volume 2| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 1999| pages = 609–10| url = https://books.google.com/?id=2bDxJW3x4f8C&amp;dq=spartan+women| isbn = 978-0-313-31072-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the Hellenistic Period, some of the wealthiest Spartans were women.&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, Sarah B.

[[Plato]] acknowledged that extending [[civil and political rights]] to women would substantively alter the nature of the household and the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Robinson| first = Eric W.| title = Ancient Greek democracy: readings and sources| publisher = Wiley-Blackwell| year = 2004| page = 300| url = https://books.google.com/?id=Jug6crxEImIC&amp;dq=Aristophanes+ecclesiazusae+women%27s+rights| isbn = 978-0-631-23394-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]], who had been taught by Plato, denied that women were slaves or subject to property, arguing that "nature has distinguished between the female and the slave", but he considered wives to be "bought". He argued that women's main economic activity is that of safeguarding the household property created by men. According to Aristotle the labour of women added no value because "the art of household management is not identical with the art of getting wealth, for the one uses the material which the other provides".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gerhard| first = Ute| title = Debating women's equality: toward a feminist theory of law from a European perspective| publisher = Rutgers University Press| year = 2001| pages = 32–35| url = https://books.google.com/?id=XMohyLfGDDsC&amp;dq=women+right+to+property| isbn = 978-0-8135-2905-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to these views, the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophers]] argued for equality of the sexes, sexual inequality being in their view contrary to the laws of nature.&lt;ref name="Colish"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Stoic Tradition from Antiquity to the Early Middle Ages: Stoicism in classical Latin literature |last=Colish |first=Marcia L. |year=1990 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-09327-0 |pages=37–38  |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WY-2MeZqoK0C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=stoics%2Bslavery#v=onepage&amp;q=stoics%2Bslavery&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, they followed the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], who argued that men and women should wear the same clothing and receive the same kind of education. They also saw marriage as a moral companionship between equals rather than a biological or social necessity and practiced these views in their lives as well as their teachings. The Stoics adopted the views of the Cynics and added them to their own theories of human nature, thus putting their sexual egalitarianism on a strong philosophical basis.&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt;

McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 31–32, 457, ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Freeborn women of [[ancient Rome]] were [[Roman citizenship|citizens]] who enjoyed legal privileges and protections that did not extend to [[peregrinus (Roman)|non-citizens]] or [[slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]]. [[Social class in ancient Rome|Roman society]], however, was [[patriarchal]], and women could not vote, hold [[Roman magistrate|public office]], or serve in the military.&lt;ref&gt;[[A.N. Sherwin-White]], ''Roman Citizenship'' (Oxford University Press, 1979), pp. 211 and 268; Bruce W. Frier and Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 31–32, 457, ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Women of the upper classes exercised political influence through marriage and motherhood. During the [[Roman Republic]], the [[Cornelia Africana|mother of the Gracchus brothers]] and [[Aurelia Cotta|of Julius Caesar]] were noted as exemplary women who advanced the career of their sons. During the [[Roman Empire|Imperial period]], women of the emperor's family could acquire considerable political power and were regularly depicted in official art and on coinage.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Eck, "The Emperor and His Advisors", ''Cambridge Ancient History'' (Cambridge University History, 2000), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

The central core of the Roman society was the ''[[pater familias]]'' or the male head of the household who exercised his authority over all his children, servants, and wife.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; Girls had equal inheritance rights with boys if their father died without leaving a will.&lt;ref name="David Johnston 1999 p. 134"&gt;David Johnston, ''Roman Law in Context'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), chapter 3.3; Frier and McGinn, '' A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', Chapter IV; Yan Thomas, "The Division of the Sexes in Roman Law", in ''A History of Women from Ancient Goddesses to Christian Saints'' (Harvard University Press, 1991), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to Athenian women, Roman women had a guardian or as it was called "tutor" who managed and oversaw all her activity.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; This tutelage had limited female activity but by the first century to sixth century BCE, tutelage became very relaxed and women were accepted to participate in more public roles such as owning or managing property and or acting as municipal patrons for gladiator games and other entertainment activities&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; Childbearing was encouraged by the state. By 27–14 BCE the ''[[ius tritium liberorum]]'' ("legal right of three children") granted symbolic honors and legal privileges to a woman who had given birth to three children and freed her from any male guardianship.&lt;ref&gt;Yan Thomas, "The Division of the Sexes in Roman Law", in ''A History of Women from Ancient Goddesses to Christian Saints'' (Harvard University Press, 1991), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest period of the [[Roman Republic]], a bride passed from her father's control into the "hand" ''(manus)'' of her husband. She then became subject to her husband's ''potestas'', though to a lesser degree than their children.&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This archaic form of ''manus'' marriage was largely abandoned by the time of [[Julius Caesar]], when a woman remained under her father's authority by law even when she moved into her husband's home. This arrangement was one of the factors in the independence Roman women enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eva Cantarella]], ''Pandora's Daughters: The Role and Status of Women in Greek and Roman Antiquity'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1987), pp. 140–41; J.P. Sullivan, "Martial's Sexual Attitudes", ''Philologus'' 123 (1979), p. 296, specifically on sexual freedom.&lt;/ref&gt; Although women had to answer to their father in legal matters, they were free of his direct scrutiny in her daily life,&lt;ref&gt;Beryl Rawson, "The Roman Family", in ''The Family in Ancient Rome: New Perspectives'' (Cornell University Press, 1986), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and her husband had no legal power over her.&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', pp. 19–20, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; When her father died, she became legally emancipated ''([[sui iuris]])''. A married woman retained ownership of any [[property]] she brought into the marriage.&lt;ref name="autogenerated19"&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Girls had equal inheritance rights with boys if their father died without leaving a will.&lt;ref name="David Johnston 1999 p. 134"/&gt; Under classical [[Roman law]], a husband had no right to abuse his wife physically or compel her to have sex.&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Wife beating was sufficient grounds for divorce or other legal action against the husband.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett G. Fagan, "Violence in Roman Social Relations", in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 487.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their legal status as citizens and the degree to which they could become emancipated, women in ancient Rome could own property, enter contracts, and engage in business.&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law,'' p. 461; W.V. Harris, "Trade", in ''The Cambridge Ancient History: The High Empire A.D. 70–192'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), vol. 11, p. 733.&lt;/ref&gt; Some acquired and disposed of sizable fortunes, and are recorded in inscriptions as benefactors in funding major public works.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret L. Woodhull, "Matronly Patrons in the Early Roman Empire: The Case of Salvia Postuma", in ''Women's Influence on Classical Civilization'' (Routledge, 2004), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman women could appear in court and argue cases, though it was customary for them to be represented by a man.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Bauman, ''Women and Politics in Ancient Rome'' (Routledge, 1992, 1994), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; They were simultaneously disparaged as too ignorant and weak-minded to practice law, and as too active and influential in legal matters—resulting in an edict that limited women to conducting cases on their own behalf instead of others'.&lt;ref&gt;Bauman, ''Women and Politics'', pp. 50–51; Juvenal, ''Satire'' 6, on women busy in the courts.&lt;/ref&gt; But even after this restriction was put in place, there are numerous examples of women taking informed actions in legal matters, including dictating legal strategy to their male advocates.&lt;ref&gt;Bauman, ''Women and Politics'', pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman law recognized [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Rape|rape]] as a crime in which the victim bore no guilt&lt;ref&gt;Ariadne Staples, ''From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins: Sex and Category in Roman Religion'' (Routledge, 1998), pp. 81–82; Jane F. Gardner, ''Women in Roman Law and Society'' (Indiana University Press, 1991), pp. 118ff.

The rape of a slave could be prosecuted only as damage to her owner's property.&lt;ref&gt;Under the ''[[Lex Aquilia]];'' Thomas A.J.

[[Stoicism|Stoic philosophies]] influenced the development of Roman law. Stoics of the Imperial era such as [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Musonius Rufus]] developed theories of [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Stoic sexual morality|just relationships]]. While not advocating equality in society or under the law, they held that nature gives men and women equal capacity for virtue and equal obligations to act virtuously, and that therefore men and women had an equal need for philosophical education.&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt; These philosophical trends among the ruling elite are thought to have helped improve the status of women under the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ratnapala| first = Suri| title = Jurisprudence| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2009| pages =134–35 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=tNwdWlXxZt8C&amp;dq=Stoic+law+women| isbn = 978-0-521-61483-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rome had no system of state-supported schooling, and education was available only to those who could pay for it.

====Byzantine Empire====
Since Byzantine law was essentially based on Roman law, the legal status of women did not change significantly from the practices of the 6th century. But the traditional restriction of women in the public life as well as the hostility against independent women still continued.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|last = Smith|first = Bonnie G|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-19-514890-9|location = London, UK|pages = [https://archive.org/details/oxfordencycloped0000unse_k2h2/page/440 440–42]|url = https://archive.org/details/oxfordencycloped0000unse_k2h2/page/440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greater influence of Greek culture contributed to strict attitudes about women'roles being domestic instead of being public.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There was also a growing trend of women who were not prostitutes, slaves or entertainers to be entirely veiled.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Like previous Roman law, women could not be legal witnesses, hold administrations or run banking but they could still inherit properties and own land.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As a rule the influence of the church was exercised in favor of the abolition of the disabilities imposed by the older law upon celibacy and childlessness, of increased facilities for entering a professed religious life, and of due provision for the wife. The church also supported the political power of those who were friendly toward the clergy. The appointment of mothers and grandmothers as tutors was sanctioned by Justinian.

The restrictions on the marriage of senators and other men of high rank with women of low rank were extended by [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]], but it was almost entirely removed by [[Justinian I|Justinian]]. Second marriages were discouraged, especially by making it legal to impose a condition that a widow's right to property should cease on remarriage, and the [[Leonine Constitutions]] at the end of the 9th century made third marriages punishable. The same constitutions made the benediction of a priest a necessary part of the ceremony of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Encyclopaedia Britannica Volume 28|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|year=1911|isbn=|editor-last=Chisholm|editor-first=Hugh|location=|pages=783|chapter=Women}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bound_feet_(X-ray).jpg|thumb|right|[[Foot binding]], a practice commonly inflicted on [[Women in China|Chinese women]] between the 10th century and the early 20th century. The image shows an X-ray of two bound feet.]]
Women throughout historical and ancient China were considered inferior and had subordinate legal status based on the [[Confucianism|Confucian law]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|last = Smith|first = Bonnie G|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-19-514890-9|location = London, UK|pages = [https://archive.org/details/oxfordencycloped0000unse_k2h2/page/426 426–27]|url = https://archive.org/details/oxfordencycloped0000unse_k2h2/page/426}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Imperial China, the "[[Three Obediences and Four Virtues|Three Obediences]]" promoted daughters to obey their fathers, wives to obey their husbands, and widows to obey their sons. Women could not inherit businesses or wealth&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and men had to adopt a son for such financial purposes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Late imperial law also featured seven different types of divorces. A wife could be ousted if she failed to birth a son, committed adultery, disobeyed her parents-in-law, spoke excessively, stole, was given to bouts of jealousy, or suffered from an incurable or loathsome disease or disorder.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; But there were also limits for the husband – for example, he could not divorce if she observed her parent's in-law's mourning sites, if she had no family to return to, or if the husband's family used to be poor and since then had become richer.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The status of women in China was also low largely due to the custom of [[foot binding]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} About 45% of Chinese women had bound feet in the 19th century. For the upper classes, it was almost 100%. In 1912, the Chinese government ordered the cessation of foot-binding. Foot-binding involved alteration of the bone structure so that the feet were only about 4 inches long. The bound feet caused difficulty of movement, thus greatly limiting the activities of women.

Due to the social custom that men and women should not be near each other, the women of China were reluctant to be treated by male doctors of Western Medicine. This resulted in a tremendous need for female doctors of Western Medicine in China. Thus, female medical missionary Dr. Mary H. Fulton (1854–1927)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Inasmuch.html?id=04TOSAAACAAJ |title=Inasmuch |author=Mary H.

Hackett (1851–1916) of Indiana, USA. The College was aimed at the spreading of Christianity and modern medicine and the elevation of Chinese women's social status.&lt;ref name="RebeccaChan"&gt;Rebecca Chan Chung, Deborah Chung and Cecilia Ng Wong, "Piloted to Serve", 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="facebook"&gt;{{cite web|author=Piloted to Serve97 personen vinden dit leuk |url=https://www.facebook.com/PilotedToServe |title=Piloted to Serve |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Republic of China (1912–49)]] and earlier Chinese governments, women were legally bought and sold into slavery under the guise of domestic servants. These women were known as [[Mui Tsai]]. The lives of Mui Tsai were recorded by American feminist [[Agnes Smedley]] in her book Portraits of Chinese Women in Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Parts of this book are available online here [https://books.google.com/books?id=zKReN05ujW4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Portraits+of+Chinese+Women+in+Revolution&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMI-Led7NLlxgIVjSmICh3LRwWC#v=onepage&amp;q=Portraits%20of%20Chinese%20Women%20in%20Revolution&amp;f=false], at Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1949 the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] had been overthrown by communist guerillas led by [[Mao Zedong]], and the [[People's Republic of China]] was founded in the same year. In May 1950 the [[People's Republic of China]] enacted the [[New Marriage Law]] to tackle the sale of women into slavery. This outlawed marriage by proxy and made marriage legal so long as both partners consent. The New Marriage Law raised the legal age of marriage to 20 for men and 18 for women. This was an essential part of countryside land reform as women could no longer legally be sold to landlords. The official slogan was "Men and women are equal; everyone is worth his (or her) salt".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=The Developing Economies|volume=48|number=2|date=June 2010|page=B5|first=Noboro|last=Niida|title=Land Reform and New Marriage Law in China|url=http://www.ide.go.jp/English/Publish/Periodicals/De/pdf/64_01_01.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403010912/http://www.ide.go.jp/English/Publish/Periodicals/De/pdf/64_01_01.pdf|archivedate=3 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in customary law, inheritance was limited to male descendants, the Qur'an introduced rules on inheritance with certain fixed shares being distributed to designated heirs, first to the nearest female relatives and then the nearest male relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (with DeLong-Bas) 2001, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Annemarie Schimmel]] "compared to the pre-Islamic position of women, [[Fiqh|Islamic legislation]] meant an enormous progress; the woman has the right, at least according to the [[Letter and spirit of the law|letter of the law]], to administer the wealth she has brought into the family or has earned by her own work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Schimmel| first = Annemarie| title = Islam | publisher = SUNY Press| year = 1992| page = 65| url = https://books.google.com/?id=m7oKd-H1BzYC&amp;dq=compared+to+the+pre-Islamic+position+of+women,+Islamic+legislation+meant+an+enormous+progress%3B+the+woman+has+the+right,+at+least+according+to+the+letter+of+the+law,+to+administer+the+wealth+she+has+brought+into+the+family+or+has+earned+by+her+own+work| isbn = 978-0-7914-1327-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Western Europe====
[[File:Medieval women hunting.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Women performing tasks during the Middle Ages]]
Women's rights were protected already by early Medieval Christian Church: one of the first formal legal provision for the right of wives was promulgated by [[Council of Agde|council of Adge]] in 506, which in Canon XVI stipulated that if a young married man wished to be ordained, he required the consent of his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QIjEVrB3b4kC&amp;pg=PA185#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Archaeology of Frankish Church Councils, AD 511-768|last=Halfond|first=Gregory I.|date=2010|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-9004179769|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English Church and culture in the Middle Ages regarded women as weak, irrational and vulnerable to temptation who was constantly needed to be kept in check.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women in England in the middle ages|last = Ward|first = Jennifer|publisher = A &amp; C Black|year = 2006|isbn = 978-1852853464|location = New York|pages = 3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=August 2017}} This was reflected on the Christian culture in England through the story of [[Adam and Eve]] where Eve fell to Satan's temptations and led Adam to eat the apple. It was belief based on St.Paul, that the pain of childbirth was a punishment for this deed that led mankind to be banished from the Garden of Eden.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Women's inferiority also appears in many medieval writing for example the 1200 AD theologian [[Jacques de Vitry]] (who was rather sympathetic to women over others) emphasized for female obedience towards their men and expressed women as being slippery, weak, untrustworthy, devious, deceitful and stubborn.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The church also promoted the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] as a role model for women to emulate by being innocent in her sexuality, being married to a husband and eventually becoming a mother. That was the core purpose set out both culturally and religiously across Medieval Europe.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Rape was also seen in medieval England as a crime against the father or husband and violation of their protection and guardianship of the women whom they look after in the household.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Women's identity in the Middle Ages was also referred through her relations with men she was associated with for example "His daughter" or "So and so's wife".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Despite all this, the Church still emphasized on the importance of love and mutual counselling within a marriage and prohibited any form of divorce so the wife would have someone to look after her.
[[File:Women activities in middle ages.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Royal women's activities in the Middle Ages]]
In overall Europe during the Middle Ages, women were inferior to that of a man in legal status.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women's Roles in the Middle Ages|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4SL2X3uHEAC|publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group|date = 1 January 2007|isbn = 9780313336355|first = Sandy|last = Bardsley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout medieval Europe, women were pressured to not attend courts and leave all legal business affairs to their husbands. In the legal system, women were regarded as the properties of men so any threat or injury to them was in the duty of their male guardians.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In Irish law, women were forbidden to act as witnesses in courts.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In Welsh law, women's testimony can be accepted towards other women but not against another man.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In France, women's testimony must corroborate with other accounts or would not be accepted.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Although women were expected to not attend courts, this however was not always true. Sometimes regardless of expectation, women did participate and attend court cases and court meetings. But women could not act as justices in courts, be attorneys, they could not be members of a jury and they could not accuse another person of a felony unless it's the murder of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women in Medieval Western European Culture|url = https://books.google.com/?id=k09yF2Ub-pYC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=women+in+middle+ages+law#v=onepage&amp;q=women%2520in%2520middle%2520ages%2520law&amp;f=false|publisher = Routledge|date = 12 November 2012|isbn = 9781136522031|first = Linda E.|last = Mitchell}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most part, the best thing a woman could do in medieval courts is observe the legal proceedings taking place.

The Swedish law protected women from the authority of their husbands by transferring the authority to their male relatives.&lt;ref name="Beattie"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Married Women and the Law in Premodern Northwest Europe|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=36uGH4HNUWoC|publisher = Boydell Press|date = 1 January 2013|isbn = 9781843838333|first = Cordelia|last = Beattie|first2 = Matthew Frank|last2 = Stevens}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wife's property and land also could not be taken by the husband without her family's consent but neither could the wife.&lt;ref name="Beattie"/&gt; This mean a woman could not transfer her property to her husband without her family or kinsman's consent either. In Swedish law, women would also only get half that of her brother in inheritance.&lt;ref name="Beattie"/&gt; Despite these legal issues, Sweden was largely ahead and much superior in their treatment towards women than most European countries.

Medieval marriages among the elites were arranged in a way that would meet the interests of the family as a whole.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Theoretically a woman needed to consent before a marriage took place and the Church encouraged this consent to be expressed in present tense and not future.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Marriage could also take place anywhere and minimum age for girls would have to be 12 while 14 for boys.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Certain areas with [[Visigoths|Visgothic]] inheritance laws until the 7th century were favorable to women while all the other laws were not.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Before Christianization of Europe, there was little space for women's consent for marriage and marriage through purchase (or ''Kaufehe'') was actually the civil norm as opposed to the alternative marriage through capture (or ''Raubehe'').&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; However Christianity was slow to reach other Baltic and Scandinavian areas with it only reaching King [[Harald Bluetooth]] of Denmark in the year 950 AD.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Those living under [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] and [[Iceland]]ic laws used marriages to forge alliances or create peace usually without the women's say or consent.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; However divorce rights were permitted to women who suffered physical abuse but protections from harm were not given to those termed "wretched" women such as beggars, servants and slave women. Having sex with them through force or without consent usually had zero legal consequence or punishment.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

During the [[Viking Age]], women had a relatively free status in the Nordic countries of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, illustrated in the Icelandic [[Grágás]] and the Norwegian [[Frostating]] laws and [[Gulating]] laws.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Borgström Eva {{sv icon}}: Makalösa kvinnor: könsöverskridare i myt och verklighet (Marvelous women : gender benders in myth and reality) Alfabeta/Anamma, Stockholm 2002. {{ISBN|91-501-0191-9}} (inb.).

The paternal aunt, paternal niece and paternal granddaughter, referred to as ''odalkvinna'', all had the right to inherit property from a deceased man.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
In the absence of male relatives, an unmarried woman with no son could, further more, inherit not only property, but also the position as head of the family from a deceased father or brother: a woman with such status was referred to as ''[[ringkvinna]]'', and she exercised all the rights afforded to the head of a family clan, such as for example the right to demand and receive fines for the slaughter of a family member, unless she married, by which her rights were transferred to her husband.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
After the age of 20, an unmarried woman, referred to as ''maer'' and ''mey'', reached legal majority and had the right to decide of her place of residence and was regarded as her own person before the law.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
An exception to her independence was the right to choose a marriage partner, as marriages was normally arranged by the clan.&lt;ref&gt;Borgström Eva{{sv icon}}: Makalösa kvinnor: könsöverskridare i myt och verklighet (Marvelous women : gender benders in myth and reality) Alfabeta/Anamma, Stockholm 2002. {{ISBN|91-501-0191-9}} (inb.). Libris 8707902.&lt;/ref&gt; Widows enjoyed the same independent status as unmarried women.
Women had religious authority and were active as priestesses (''gydja'') and oracles (''sejdkvinna'');&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Ingelman-Sundberg, Catharina, ''Forntida kvinnor: jägare, vikingahustru, prästinna'' [Ancient women: hunters, viking wife, priestess], Prisma, Stockholm, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; they were active within art as poets (''skalder'')&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and [[rune master]]s, and as merchants and medicine women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; They may also have been active within military office: the stories about [[shieldmaiden]]s is unconfirmed, but some archaeological finds such as the [[Birka female Viking warrior]] may indicate that at least some women in military authority existed.
A married woman could divorce her husband and remarry.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Ohlander, Ann-Sofie &amp; Strömberg, Ulla-Britt, Tusen svenska kvinnoår: svensk kvinnohistoria från vikingatid till nutid, 3. (A Thousand Swedish Women's Years: Swedish Women's History from the Viking Age until now), [omarb. och utök.] uppl., Norstedts akademiska förlag, Stockholm, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It was also socially acceptable for a free woman to cohabit with a man and have children with him without marrying him, even if that man was married: a woman in such a position was called ''frilla''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; There was no distinction made between children born inside or outside of marriage: both had the right to inherit property after their parents, and there was no "legitimate" or "illegitimate" children.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;
These liberties gradually disappeared from the changed after the introductions of Christianity, and from the late 13th-century, they are no longer mentioned.&lt;ref name="Anamma 2002"&gt;Borgström Eva {{sv icon}}: ''Makalösa kvinnor: könsöverskridare i myt och verklighet'' (''Marvelous women : genderbenders in myth and reality'') Alfabeta/Anamma, Stockholm 2002. {{ISBN|91-501-0191-9}} (inb.). Libris 8707902.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Christian Middle Ages, the [[Medieval Scandinavian law]] applied different laws depending of the local county law, signifying that the status of women could vary depending of which county she was living in.

The 16th and 17th century saw numerous [[witch trial]]s, which resulted in thousands of people across Europe being executed, of whom 75-95% were women (depending on time and place).&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Killing Women – Gender, Sorcery, and Violence in Late Medieval Germany|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oUfhZceOsrgC|publisher = GRIN Verlag|date = 1 November 2010|isbn = 9783640741830|first = James|last = Mitchell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The executions mostly took place in German-speaking lands, and during the 15th century the terminology "witchcraft" was definitely viewed as something feminine as opposed to prior years.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; Famous witchcraft manuals such as the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' and ''[[Summis desiderantes affectibus|Summis Desiderantes]]'' depicted witches as diabolical conspirators who worshipped Satan and were primarily women. Culture and art at the time depicted these witches as seductive and evil, further fuelling moral panic in fusion with rhetoric from the Church.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt;

The origin of the female "witch" myth traces back to Roman mythical night creatures known as Strix, who were thought to appear and disappear mysteriously in the night.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; They were also believed by many to be of transformed women by their own supernatural powers.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; This Roman myth itself is believed to originate from the Jewish Sabbath which described non-supernatural women who would suspiciously leave and return home swiftly during the night.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; Authors of the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' strongly established the link between witchcraft and women by proclaiming greater likelihood for women to be addicted to "evil".&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women in Late Medieval and Reformation Europe|last = Jewell|first = Helen M.|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0333912577|location = New York|pages = 123–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors and inquisitors [[Heinrich Kramer]] and Jacob Sprengerh justified these beliefs by claiming women had greater credulity, impressionability, feeble minds, feeble bodies, impulsivity and carnal natures which were flaws susceptible to "evil" behavior and witchcraft.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; These sort of beliefs at the time could send female hermits or beggars to trials just for offering remedies or herbal medicine.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; These set of developed myths eventually lead to the 16-17th century witch trials which found thousands of women burned at stake.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt;

By 1500, Europe was divided into two types of secular law.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|last = Smith|first = Bonnie G|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-19-514890-9|location = London, UK|pages = [https://archive.org/details/oxfordencycloped0000unse_k2h2/page/428 428–29]|url = https://archive.org/details/oxfordencycloped0000unse_k2h2/page/428}}&lt;/ref&gt; One was customary law which was predominant in northern France, England and Scandinavia, and the other was Roman based written laws which was predominant in southern France, Italy, Spain and Portugal.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Customary laws favoured men more than women.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For example, inheritance among the elites in Italy, England, Scandinavia and France was passed on to the eldest male heir. In all of the regions, the laws also gave men substantial powers over lives, property and bodies of their wives.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, there were some improvements for women as opposed to ancient custom for example they could inherit in the absence of their brothers, do certain trades without their husbands and widows to receive dower.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In areas governed by Roman-based written laws women were under male guardianship in matters involving property and law, fathers overseeing daughters, husbands overseeing wives and uncles or male relatives overseeing widows.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Throughout Europe, women's legal status centered around her marital status while marriage itself was the biggest factor in restricting women's autonomy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Custom, statue and practice not only reduced women's rights and freedoms but prevented single or widowed women from holding public office on the justification that they might one day marry.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

According to [[English Common Law]], which developed from the 12th century onward, all property which a wife held at the time of marriage became a possession of her husband. Eventually English courts forbade a husband's transferring property without the consent of his wife, but he still retained the right to manage it and to receive the money which it produced. French married women suffered from restrictions on their legal capacity which were removed only in 1965.&lt;ref name="Badr-1984"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Islamic Criminal Justice|first=Gamal M.|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=32|issue=1|date=Winter 1984|pages=167–69 |doi=10.2307/840274|ref=harv|author2=Mayer, Ann Elizabeth|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|jstor=840274}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th century, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in Europe allowed more women to add their voices, including the English writers [[Jane Anger]], [[Emilia Lanier|Aemilia Lanyer]], and the prophetess [[Anna Trapnell]].

The philosopher [[John Locke]] opposed marital inequality and the mistreatment of women during this time.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gender and Good Governance in John Locke|url = http://www.ajsih.org/index.php/ajsih/article/view/56|journal = American Journal of Social Issues and Humanities|date = 19 July 2012|issn = 2276-6928|volume = 2|issue = 4|first = Ikechukwu|last = Anthony|first2 = O. S. A.|last2 = Kanu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was well known for advocating for marital equality among the sexes in his work during the 17th century. According to a study published in the ''American Journal of Social Issues &amp; Humanities,'' the condition for women during Locke's time were as quote:&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
* English women had fewer grounds for divorce than men until 1923&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
* Husbands controlled most of their wives' personal property until the [[Married Women's Property Act 1870]] and [[Married Women's Property Act 1882]]&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
* Children were the husband's property&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
* Rape was legally impossible within a marriage&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
* Wives lacked crucial features of legal personhood, since the husband was taken as the representative of the family (thereby eliminating the need for women's suffrage). These legal features of marriage suggest that the idea of a marriage between equals appeared unlikely to most Victorians.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; (Quoted from ''Gender and Good Governance in John Locke, American Journal of Social Issues &amp; Humanities Vol 2''&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;)

Other philosophers have also made the statements regarding women's rights during this time. For example, [[Thomas Paine]] wrote in ''An Occasional Letter on the Female Sex 1775'' where he states (as quote) :&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The English Literatures of America: 1500-1800|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OsRmAgAAQBAJ|publisher = Routledge|date = 19 December 2013|isbn = 9781317795407|language = en|first = Myra|last = Jehlen|first2 = Michael|last2 = Warner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"If we take a survey of ages and of countries, we shall find the women, almost without exception... adored and oppressed... they are ... robbed of freedom of will by the laws...Yet such, I am sorry to say, is the lot of women over the whole earth. Man with regard to them, has been either an insensible husband or an oppressor."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

A paternal society can find prefer to make women's rights a man's duty, for instance under English common law husbands had to maintain their wives. This duty was abolished in 2010.&lt;ref name="UKEqualityAct"&gt;{{cite web |title=Equality Act 2010 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15 |publisher=UK Government Legislation |accessdate=22 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OldLawsOfEngland"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sir William Blackstone |title=Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765-1769) |url=https://lonang.com/library/reference/blackstone-commentaries-law-england/bla-115 |website=Lonang Institute |accessdate=22 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the late 18th century, and throughout the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, rights, as a concept and claim, gained increasing political, social, and philosophical importance in Europe. Movements emerged which demanded [[freedom of religion]], the abolition of [[slavery]], rights for women, rights for those who did not own property, and [[universal suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Sweet| first = William| title = Philosophical theory and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights| publisher = University of Ottawa Press| year = 2003| page = 4| url = https://books.google.com/?id=_V_KuJGcJSAC&amp;dq=%22natural+law%22+women+%22human+nature%22| isbn =978-0-7766-0558-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 18th century the question of women's rights became central to political debates in both France and Britain. At the time some of the greatest thinkers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], who defended democratic principles of [[Egalitarianism|equality]] and challenged notions that a privileged few should rule over the vast majority of the population, believed that these principles should be applied only to their own gender and their own race. The philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], for example, thought that it was the order of nature for woman to obey men. He wrote "Women do wrong to complain of the inequality of man-made laws" and claimed that "when she tries to usurp our rights, she is our inferior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Lauren| first = Paul Gordon| title = The evolution of international human rights: visions seen| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2003| pages = 29–30| url = https://books.google.com/?id=gHRhWgbWyzMC&amp;dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Man+and+of+the+Citizen| id = | isbn =978-0-8122-1854-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1791 the French playwright and political [[Activism|activist]] [[Olympe de Gouges]] published the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'',&lt;ref name=MS1112&gt;Macdonald and Scherf, "Introduction", pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; modelled on the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] of 1789. The Declaration is ironic in formulation and exposes the failure of the [[French Revolution]], which had been devoted to [[Egalitarianism|equality]]. It states that: "This revolution will only take effect when all women become fully aware of their deplorable condition, and of the rights they have lost in society". The Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen follows the seventeen articles of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] point for point and has been described by Camille Naish as "almost a parody...of the original document". The first article of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen proclaims that "Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be based only on common utility." The first article of Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen replied: "Woman is born free and remains equal to man in rights. Social distinctions may only be based on common utility". De Gouges expands the sixth article of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which declared the rights of citizens to take part in the formation of law, to:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"All citizens including women are equally admissible to all public dignities, offices and employments, according to their capacity, and with no other distinction than that of their virtues and talents".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
De Gouges also draws attention to the fact that under French law women were fully punishable, yet denied equal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Death comes to the maiden: Sex and Execution, 1431–1933 |last=Naish |first=Camille |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |isbn= 978-0-415-05585-7 |page=137 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=OHYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Woman+and+the+Female+Citizen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1869 essay "[[The Subjection of Women]]" the English philosopher and political theorist [[John Stuart Mill]] described the situation for women in Britain as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We are continually told that civilization and Christianity have restored to the woman her just rights. Meanwhile the wife is the actual bondservant of her husband; no less so, as far as the legal obligation goes, than slaves commonly so called."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Then a member of parliament, Mill argued that women deserve the [[right to vote]], though his proposal to replace the term "man" with "person" in the second [[Reform Bill of&amp;nbsp;1867]] was greeted with laughter in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and defeated by 76&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;196 votes. His arguments won little support amongst contemporaries&lt;ref name="Brave new world – Women's rights"/&gt; but his attempt to amend the reform bill generated greater attention for the issue of women's suffrage in Britain.&lt;ref name=suffrage/&gt; Initially only one of several women's rights campaigns, suffrage became the primary cause of the British women's movement at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The women's suffrage movement in Britain, 1866–1928 |last=Van Wingerden |first=Sophia A. |year=1999 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn= 978-0-312-21853-9 |pages=1–2 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=0oLxK_NHI6kC&amp;printsec=frontcover }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the ability to vote was restricted to wealthy [[Property law|property owners]] within British jurisdictions. This arrangement implicitly excluded women as [[property law]] and [[marriage law]] gave men ownership rights at marriage or inheritance until the 19th&amp;nbsp;century. Although male suffrage broadened during the century, women were explicitly prohibited from voting nationally and locally in the 1830s by the [[Reform Act 1832]] and the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]].&lt;ref name=X&gt;Phillips, Melanie, ''The Ascent of Woman: A History of the Suffragette Movement'' (Abacus, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Millicent Fawcett]] and [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] led the public campaign on women's suffrage and in 1918 a bill was passed allowing women over the age of 30 to vote.&lt;ref name="X" /&gt;

By the 1860s, the economic sexual politics of middle class women in Britain and its neighboring Western European countries was guided by factors such as the evolution of 19th century [[Consumerism|consumer]] culture, including the emergence of the [[department store]], and [[Separate spheres]].
In ''Come Buy, Come Buy: Shopping and the Culture of Consumption in Victorian Women's Writing'', Krista Lysack's literary analysis of 19th century contemporary literature claims through her resources' reflection of common contemporary norms, "Victorian femininity as characterized by self-renunciation and the regulation of appetite."&lt;ref name="Lysack, Krista 2008"&gt;Lysack, Krista. Come buy, come buy : shopping and the culture of consumption in Victorian women's writing. n.p.: Athens : Ohio University Press, c2008., 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; And while women, particularly those in the middle class, obtained modest control of daily household expenses and had the ability to leave the house, attend social events, and shop for personal and household items in the various department stores developing in late 19th century Europe, Europe's socioeconomic climate pervaded the ideology that women were not in complete control over their urges to spend (assuming) their husband or father's wages. As a result, many advertisements for socially 'feminine' goods revolved around upward social progression, [[exoticism]]s from the [[Orient]], and added efficiency for household roles women were deemed responsible for, such as cleaning, childcare, and cooking.&lt;ref name="Lysack, Krista 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport, Erika Diane.

=====Russia=====
By law and custom, Muscovite Russia was a patriarchal society that subordinated women to men, and the young to their elders. [[Peter the Great]] relaxed the second custom, but not the subordination of women.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|last = Smith|first = Bonnie G|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-19-514890-9|location = London, UK|pages = [https://archive.org/details/oxfordencycloped0000unse_k2h2/page/443 443–44]|url = https://archive.org/details/oxfordencycloped0000unse_k2h2/page/443}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decree of 1722 explicitly forbade any forced marriages by requiring both bride and groom to consent, while parental permission still remained a requirement. But during Peter's reign, only the man could get rid of his wife by putting her in a nunnery.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In terms of laws, there were double standards to women. Adulterous wives were sentenced to forced labor, while men who murdered their wives were merely flogged.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After the death Peter the Great, laws and customs pertaining to men's marital authority over their wives increased.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1782, civil law reinforced women's responsibility to obey her husband.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; By 1832, the Digest of laws changed this obligation into "unlimited obedience".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In the 18th century, Russian orthodox church further got its authority over marriage and banned priests from granting divorce, even for severely abused wives.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; By 1818, Russian senate had also forbade separation of married couples.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

During [[World War I]], caring for children was increasingly difficult for women, many of whom could not support themselves, and whose husbands had died or were fighting in the war. Many women had to give up their children to children's homes infamous for abuse and neglect. These children's homes were unofficially dubbed as "angel factories". After the [[October Revolution]], the Bolsheviks shut down an infamous angel factory known as the 'Nikolaev Institute' situated near the Moika Canal. The Bolsheviks then replaced the Nikolaev Institute with a modern maternity home called the 'Palace for Mothers and Babies'. This maternity home was used by the [[Bolsheviks]] as a model for future maternity hospitals. The countess who ran the old Institute was moved to a side wing, however she spread rumours that the Bolsheviks had removed sacred pictures, and that the nurses were promiscuous with sailors. The maternity hospital was burnt down hours before it was scheduled to open, and the countess was suspected of being responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Cathy |date=1987 |title=Women in Revolutionary Russia |location=Great Britain|publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=39 |isbn=0-521-31969-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent to which women could participate in [[Japanese society]] has varied over time and social classes. In the 8th century, Japan had women emperors, and in the 12th century ([[Heian period]]) women in Japan occupied a relatively high status, although still subordinated to men.
From the late [[Edo period]], the status of women declined. In the 17th century, the "[[Onna Daigaku]]", or "Learning for Women", by [[Confucianism|Confucianist]] author [[Kaibara Ekken]], spelled out expectations for Japanese women, lowering significantly their status.&lt;ref name=Ekken&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ekken|first1=Kaibara|title=Onna Daigaku A Treasure Box of Women's Learning.|date=2010|publisher=Gardners Books|isbn=978-0955979675|url=https://archive.org/stream/womenwisdomofjap00kaib/womenwisdomofjap00kaib_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the [[Meiji period]], industrialization and urbanization reduced the authority of fathers and husbands, but at the same time the Meiji Civil Code of 1898 denied women legal rights and subjugated them to the will of household heads.&lt;ref name="Womeninworldhistory"&gt;[http://www.womeninworldhistory.com/WR-04.html The Meiji Reforms and Obstacles for Women Japan, 1878–1927]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid 20th century the status of women improved greatly. Although Japan is often considered a very conservative country, it was in fact earlier than many European countries on giving women legal rights in the 20th century, as the 1947 [[Constitution of Japan]] provided a legal framework favorable to the advancement of women's equality in Japan. Japan for instance enacted women's suffrage in 1946, earlier than several European countries such as [[Switzerland]] (1971 at federal level; 1990 on local issues in the canton of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]]), [[Portugal]] (1976 on equal terms with men, with restrictions since 1931), [[San Marino]] in 1959, [[Monaco]] in 1962, [[Andorra]] in 1970, and [[Liechtenstein]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/timeline/votes_to_women.shtml|title=Radio 4 Woman's Hour – Timeline:When women got the vote|author=BBC|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Voter Turnout in Western Europe Since 1945: A Regional Report |author1=Rafael López Pintor |author2=Maria Gratschew |author3=Tim Bittiger |publisher=International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance |year=2004 |isbn=978-9185391004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Australia=====
[[File:Catherine Helen Spence.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.65|Australia's first female political candidate, [[South Australia]]n suffragette [[Catherine Helen Spence]] (1825-1910)]]
The history of women's rights in [[Australia]] is a contradictory one: while Australia led the world in women's suffrage rights in the 19th century, it has been very slow in recognizing women's professional rights - it was not until 1966 that its [[marriage bar]] was removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://lrrpublic.cli.det.nsw.edu.au/lrrSecure/Sites/Web/pre_liberation/other/restrictions_pop.htm | title=Pre -'liberation' - Restrictions}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, reforms which allowed women both to vote and stand for office in [[South Australia]] in the late 19th century were a cornerstone for women's political rights in other parts of the world. In this regard, Australia differs from other cultures, in that women's suffrage in Australia was one of the earliest objectives of the feminist movement there (beginning with South Australia and Western Australia) unlike other cultures, such as Eastern European cultures, where at the turn of the 20th century the feminist movement focused on [[labour rights]], access to professions and education, rather than political rights. To this day, Australia has a quite low percentage of women in business executive roles compared to other countries with equivalent corporate structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://theconversation.com/australian-firms-trail-world-for-women-in-top-roles-11008 | title=Australian firms trail world for women in top roles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core concepts==
===Natural rights===
17th century [[natural law]] philosophers in Britain and America, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[John Locke]], developed the theory of [[natural rights]] in reference to ancient philosophers such as [[Aristotle]] and the Christian theologist [[Aquinas]]. Like the ancient philosophers, 17th century natural law philosophers defended [[slavery]] and an inferior status of women in law.&lt;ref name="Morey 2010 282"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Morey| first = Dr Robert A.| title = The Bible, Natural theology and Natural Law: Conflict Or Compromise?| publisher = Xulon Press| year = 2010| page = 282 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Ct2P-AUUMe0C&amp;dq=Dr+Robert+a.+Morey| isbn = 978-1-60957-143-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relying on ancient Greek philosophers, natural law philosophers argued that [[natural rights]] were not derived from god, but were "universal, self-evident, and intuitive", a law that could be found in nature. They believed that natural rights were self-evident to "civilised man" who lives "in the highest form of society".&lt;ref name="Morey 2010 297"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Morey| first = Dr Robert A.| title = The Bible, Natural theology and Natural Law: Conflict Or Compromise?| publisher = Xulon Press| year = 2010| page = 297 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Ct2P-AUUMe0C&amp;dq=Dr+Robert+a.+Morey| isbn = 978-1-60957-143-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural rights derived from [[human nature]], a concept first established by the ancient Greek philosopher [[Zeno of Citium]] in ''Concerning Human Nature''. Zenon argued that each rational and civilized male Greek citizen had a "divine spark" or "soul" within him that existed independent of the body. Zeno founded the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophy]] and the idea of a human nature was adopted by other Greek philosophers, and later [[natural law]] philosophers and western [[humanists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Morey| first = Dr Robert A.| title = The Bible, Natural theology and Natural Law: Conflict Or Compromise?| publisher = Xulon Press| year = 2010| page = 214 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Ct2P-AUUMe0C&amp;dq=Dr+Robert+a.+Morey| isbn = 978-1-60957-143-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle developed the widely adopted idea of [[rationality]], arguing that man was a "rational animal" and as such a natural power of reason. Concepts of human nature in ancient Greece depended on gender, ethnic, and other qualifications&lt;ref name="Morey 2010 212"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Morey| first = Dr Robert A.| title = The Bible, Natural theology and Natural Law: Conflict Or Compromise?| publisher = Xulon Press| year = 2010| page = 212 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Ct2P-AUUMe0C&amp;dq=Dr+Robert+a.+Morey| isbn = 978-1-60957-143-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 17th century natural law philosophers came to regard women along with children, slaves and non-whites, as neither "rational" nor "civilised".&lt;ref name="Morey 2010 297"/&gt; Natural law philosophers claimed the inferior status of women was "common sense" and a matter of "nature". They believed that women could not be treated as equal due to their "inner nature".&lt;ref name="Morey 2010 282"/&gt; The views of 17th century natural law philosophers were opposed in the 18th and 19th century by [[evangelical]] [[natural theology]] philosophers such as [[William Wilberforce]] and [[Charles Spurgeon]], who argued for the abolition of slavery and advocated for women to have rights equal to that of men.&lt;ref name="Morey 2010 282"/&gt; Modern natural law theorists, and advocates of natural rights, claim that all people have a human nature, regardless of gender, ethnicity or other qualifications, therefore all people have natural rights.&lt;ref name="Morey 2010 212"/&gt;

{{Further|Employment discrimination law in the European Union}}
[[Labour law|Employment rights]] for women include non-discriminatory access of women to jobs and [[equal pay]]. The rights of women and men to have equal pay and equal benefits for equal work were openly denied by the [[British Hong Kong]] Government up to the early 1970s. Leslie Wah-Leung Chung (鍾華亮, 1917–2009), President of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants' Association 香港政府華員會&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkccsa.org/ |title=香港政府華員會 |publisher=Hkccsa.org |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1965–68), contributed to the establishment of equal pay for men and women, including the right for married women to be permanent employees. Before this, the job status of a woman changed from permanent employee to temporary employee once she was married, thus losing the pension benefit. Some of them even lost their jobs. Since nurses were mostly women, this improvement of the rights of married women meant much to the nursing profession.&lt;ref name="RebeccaChan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="facebook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="torontosun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.torontosun.com/2012/04/06/celebrating-two-lives-well-lived|title=Celebrating two lives well lived &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Toronto Sun|publisher=m.torontosun.com|accessdate=24 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120716175556/http://m.torontosun.com/2012/04/06/celebrating-two-lives-well-lived|archivedate=16 July 2012|df=dmy-all|date=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ottawasun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ottawasun.com/videos/celebrating-two-lives-well-lived/1550780688001|title=Celebrating two lives well lived : Featured OTT : Videos|publisher=ottawasun.com|accessdate=24 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704133812/http://www.ottawasun.com/videos/celebrating-two-lives-well-lived/1550780688001|archivedate=4 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Connor |first=Kevin |url=http://www.torontosun.com/2012/04/07/life-love-and-service-recalled |title=Life, love and service &amp;#124; Toronto &amp; GTA &amp;#124; News |newspaper=Toronto Sun |date=7 April 2012 |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.singtao.ca/toronto/2012-04-08/city1333873203d3799095.html |title=曾參與二戰及香港保衛戰華裔夫婦.加美軍方墓前致最高敬意_星島日報_加拿大多倫多中文新聞網。 Canada Toronto Chinese newspaper |publisher=News.singtao.ca |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epapertor.worldjournal.com/showtor.html?apJi+mgEEOB3Bg1Fmi3TsQ==,MMV3f+xDb0CKYCyOu+WesQ== |title=世界日報電子報 – World Journal ePaper |publisher=Epapertor.worldjournal.com |accessdate=9 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812123852/http://epapertor.worldjournal.com/showtor.html?apJi+mgEEOB3Bg1Fmi3TsQ==,MMV3f+xDb0CKYCyOu+WesQ== |archivedate=12 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mingpaotor.com/htm/News/20120408/tfc1.htm |title=明報新聞網海外版 – 加東版(多倫多) – Canada Toronto Chinese Newspaper – 社區新聞 |publisher=Mingpaotor.com |accessdate=9 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812061427/http://www.mingpaotor.com/htm/News/20120408/tfc1.htm |archivedate=12 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some European countries, married women could not work without the consent of their husbands until a few decades ago, for example in [[France]] until 1965&lt;ref name=Guillaumin&gt;{{cite book |last=Guillaumin|first=Colette|year=1994 |title=Racism, Sexism, Power, and Ideology |pages=193–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Meltzer&gt;{{cite book |last=Meltzer |first=Françoise |year=1995 |title=Hot Property: The Stakes and Claims of Literary Originality |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Spain]] until 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/spain/43.htm|title=Spain – SOCIAL VALUES AND ATTITUDES|work=countrystudies.us|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[marriage bar]]s, a practice adopted from the late 19th century to the 1970s across many countries, including Austria, Australia, Ireland, Canada, and Switzerland, restricted married women from employment in many professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=23196053|title=JSTOR|journal=Saothar|volume=12|pages=47–52|last1=O'Leary|first1=Eoin|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/standard/history/scotland_britain_1880_now/employment_women/revision/3/|title=Standard Grade Bitesize History – Women and work : Revision, p. 3|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century some women began to ask for, demand, and then agitate and demonstrate for the [[right to vote]] – the right to participate in their government and its law making.&lt;ref name=Krolokke&gt;Krolokke, Charlotte and Anne Scott Sorensen, 'From Suffragettes to Grrls' in Gender Communication Theories and Analyses:From Silence to Performance (Sage, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Other women opposed suffrage, like [[Helen Kendrick Johnson]], who argued in the 1897 pamphlet ''Woman and the Republic'' that women could achieve legal and economic equality without having the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Feminism's Founding Fathers: The Men Who Fought for Women's Rights|author=Kaevan Gazdar|publisher= John Hunt Publishing |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xznaDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT66&amp;dq=Helen+Kendrick+Johnson+women%27s+rights#v=onepage&amp;q=Helen%20Kendrick%20Johnson%20women%27s%20rights&amp;f=false|year=2016 |isbn=978-1-78099-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideals of [[women's suffrage]] developed alongside that of [[universal suffrage]] and today women's suffrage is considered a right (under the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]]). During the 19th century the right to vote was gradually extended in many countries, and women started to campaign for their right to vote. In 1893 New Zealand became the first country to give women the right to vote on a national level. Australia gave women the right to vote in 1902.&lt;ref name=suffrage&gt;{{cite web |title=Women's Suffrage |url=http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/article/womenx2019s-suffrage |publisher=Scholastic |accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, most provinces enacted women's suffrage between 1917–1919, late adopters being [[Prince Edward Island]] in 1922, [[Newfoundland]] in 1925 and [[Quebec]] in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Parlinfo/Compilations/ProvinceTerritory/ProvincialWomenRightToVote.aspx|title=Women's Right to Vote in Canada|work=parl.gc.ca|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Latin America some countries gave women the right to vote in the first half of the 20th century – [[Ecuador]] (1929), [[Brazil]] (1932), [[El Salvador]] (1939), [[Dominican Republic]] (1942), [[Guatemala]] (1956) and [[Argentina]] (1946). In [[India]], under colonial rule, universal suffrage was granted in 1935. Other Asian countries gave women the right to vote in the mid 20th century – [[Japan]] (1945), [[China]] (1947) and [[Indonesia]] (1955). In Africa, women generally got the right to vote along with men through universal suffrage – [[Liberia]] (1947), [[Uganda]] (1958) and [[Nigeria]] (1960). In many countries in the Middle East universal suffrage was acquired after World War II, although in others, such as [[Kuwait]], suffrage is very limited.&lt;ref name=suffrage/&gt; On 16 May 2005, the Parliament of Kuwait extended suffrage to women by a 35–23 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/05/16/kuwait.women/index.html |title="Kuwait grants women right to vote" CNN.com (May 16, 2005) |publisher=CNN |date=16 May 2005 |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Property rights===
During the 19th century some women, such as [[Ernestine Rose]], [[Paulina Wright Davis]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], in the United States and Britain began to challenge laws that denied them the [[Women's Property Rights|right to their property]] once they married. Under the common law doctrine of ''[[coverture]]'' husbands gained control of their wives' real estate and wages. Beginning in the 1840s, state legislatures in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/marriedwomensproperty/a/property_1848ny.htm |title=Married Women's Property Act &amp;#124; 1848 &amp;#124; New York State |publisher=Womenshistory.about.com |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the British Parliament&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umd.umich.edu/casl/hum/eng/classes/434/geweb/PROPERTY.htm |title=Property Rights Of Women |publisher=Umd.umich.edu |accessdate=30 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120805171942/http://www.umd.umich.edu/casl/hum/eng/classes/434/geweb/PROPERTY.htm |archivedate=5 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; began passing statutes that protected women's property from their husbands and their husbands' creditors. These laws were known as the [[Married Women's Property Acts in the United States|Married Women's Property Acts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/366305/Married-Womens-Property-Acts |title=Married Women's Property Acts (United States [1839&amp;#93;)&amp;nbsp;– Britannica Online Encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courts in the 19th-century United States also continued to require privy examinations of married women who sold their property. A [[privy examination]] was a practice in which a married woman who wished to sell her property had to be separately examined by a judge or justice of the peace outside of the presence of her husband and asked if her husband was pressuring her into signing the document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_womens_history/v012/12.2braukman.html |title=Project MUSE&amp;nbsp;– Journal of Women's History&amp;nbsp;– Married Women's Property and Male Coercion: United States Courts and the Privy Examination, 1864–1887 |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Property rights for women continued to be restricted in many European countries until legal reforms of the 1960-70s. For example, in [[West Germany]], the law pertaining to rural farm succession favored male heirs until 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/inheritance-laws/germany.php|title=Germany: Inheritance Laws in the 19th and 20th Centuries|last=Palmer|first=Edith|date=2015-09-06|website=www.loc.gov|access-date=2019-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, [[Head and master]] laws, which gave sole control of marital property to the husband, were common until a few decades ago. The Supreme Court, in ''[[Kirchberg v. Feenstra]]'' (1981), declared such laws unconstitutional.

===Freedom of movement===
[[File:A_Chinese_Golden_Lily_Foot,_Lai_Afong,_c1870s.jpg|thumb|left|Woman with [[Foot binding|bound feet]], 1870s]]
[[File:Ladies cabul1848b.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|''Ladies of [[Kabul|Caubul]]'' (1848 lithograph, by James Rattray) showing the lifting of [[purdah]] in [[zenana]] areas – Oriental and India Office Collection, British Library]]
[[Freedom of movement]] is an essential right, recognized by international instruments, including Article 15 (4) of [[CEDAW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 September 2017 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5xc2eRFDv?url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm |archive-date=1 April 2011 |url-status=bot: unknown |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in many regions of the world, women have this right severely restricted, in law or in practice. For instance, in some countries women may not leave the home without a male guardian,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/24691034|title=Why can't women drive in Saudi Arabia?|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2019-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; or without the consent of the husband – for example the personal law of [[Yemen]] states that a wife must obey her husband and must not get out of the home without his consent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/Yemen%27s%20darkside-discrimination_Yemen_HRC101.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Even in countries which do not have legal restrictions, women's movement may be prevented in practice by social and religious norms such as [[purdah]]. Laws restricting women from travelling existed until relatively recently in some Western countries: until 1983, in [[Australia]] the passport application of a married woman had to be authorized by her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614171552/http://www.passports.gov.au/Web/passport_history.aspx|title=The History of Passports in Australia|date=2006-06-14|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Middle Eastern countries also follow the [[Wali (Islamic legal guardian)|male guardianship system]] in the modern era, where women are required to seek permission from the male family member for several things, including traveling to other nations. In August 2019, [[Saudi Arabia]] ended its male guardianship laws, allowing women to travel by themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-saudi-women/saudi-arabia-implements-end-to-travel-restrictions-for-saudi-women-agency-idUKKCN1VA1ON|title=Saudi Arabia implements end to travel restrictions for Saudi women - agency|accessdate=20 August 2019|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, reports relieved that women’s rights activists, who have campaigned for greater [[gender equality]] in the country, remain in detention or on trial. Rights group called for the release of these imprisoned activists. They also argued that reforms do not mend things entirely and that Saudi women will still require permission of a male relative to marry or to leave prison or women’s shelters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://time.com/5644080/saudi-arabia-guardianship-women/|title=Saudi Arabia Is Introducing Landmark Reforms for Women.

Various practices have been used historically to restrict women's freedom of movement, such as [[foot binding]], the custom of applying painfully tight binding to the feet of young Chinese girls, which was common between the 10th and 20th century.

Women's freedom of movement may be restricted by laws, but it may also be restricted by attitudes towards women in public spaces. In areas where it is not socially accepted for women to leave the home, women who are outside may face abuse such as insults, sexual harassment and violence.
Many of the restrictions on women's freedom of movement are framed as measures to "protect" women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.empowerwomen.org/en/who-we-are/news/2016/2/freedom-of-movement-and-womens-economic-empowerment|title=Empower Women - Freedom of movement and women's economic empowerment|website=EmpowerWomen|language=en|access-date=2019-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informing women about their legal rights===
The lack of legal knowledge among many women, especially in developing countries, is a major obstacle in the improvement of women's situation. International bodies, such as the United Nations, have stated that the obligation of states does not only consist in passing relevant laws, but also in informing women about the existence of such laws, in order to enable them to seek justice and realize in practice their rights. Therefore, states must popularize the laws, and explain them clearly to the public, in order to prevent ignorance, or misconceptions originating in [[myth|popular myth]]s, about the laws. The United Nations Development Programme states that, in order to advance gender justice, "Women must know their rights and be able to access legal systems",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/crisis%20prevention/undp-cpr-8-point-agenda-practical-positive-outcomes-girls-women-crisis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1993 UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women states at Art. 4 (d) [...] "States should also inform women of their rights in seeking redress through such mechanisms".&lt;ref name="un-documents.net"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm|title=A/RES/48/104 - Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women - UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|website=www.un-documents.net|access-date=2019-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discrimination===
Women's rights movements focus on ending [[discrimination]] of women. In this regard, the definition of discrimination itself is important. According to the jurisprudence of the [[European Court of Human Rights|ECHR]], the right to freedom from discrimination includes not only the obligation of states to treat in the same way persons who are in analogous situations, but also the obligation to treat in a different way persons who are in different situations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.equalrightstrust.org/ertdocumentbank/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20Case%20of%20Thlimmenos%20v%20Greece%20_2_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard equity, not just "equality" is important. Therefore, states must sometimes differentiate between women and men – through for example offering [[maternity leave]] or other legal protections surrounding pregnancy and childbirth (to take into account the biological realities of [[reproduction]]), or through acknowledging a specific historical context. For example, acts of violence committed by men against women do not happen in a vacuum, but are part of a social context: in ''Opuz v Turkey'', the ECHR defined [[violence against women]] as a form of discrimination against women;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interights.org/opuz/index.htm{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;para 200: "[T]he Court considers that the violence suffered by the applicant and her mother may be regarded as ''gender-based violence which is a form of discrimination against women''&lt;/ref&gt; this is also the position of the Istanbul Convention which at Article 3 states that "violence against women" is understood as a violation of human rights and ''a form of discrimination against women'' [...]".&lt;ref&gt;https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=090000168046031c&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different views on where it is appropriate to differentiate between women and men, and one view is that the act of [[sexual intercourse]] is an act where this difference must be acknowledged, both due to the increased physical risks for the woman,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unfpa.org/resources/giving-special-attention-girls-and-adolescents|title=Giving Special Attention to Girls and Adolescents|website=www.unfpa.org|language=en|access-date=2019-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and due to the historical context of women being systematically subjected to forced sexual intercourse while in a socially subordinated position (particularly [[marital rape|within marriage]] and [[Wartime sexual violence|during war]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31473687_Why_Sexual_Penetration_Requires_Justification&lt;/ref&gt; States must also differentiate with regard to healthcare by ensuring that [[women's health]] - particularly with regard to [[reproductive health]] such as [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]] - is not neglected. According to the World Health Organization "Discrimination in health care settings takes many forms and is often manifested when an individual or group is denied access to health care services that are otherwise available to others. It can also occur through denial of services that are only needed by certain groups, such as women."&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/27-06-2017-joint-united-nations-statement-on-ending-discrimination-in-health-care-settings|title=Joint United Nations statement on ending discrimination in health care settings|website=www.who.int|language=en|access-date=2019-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The refusal of states to acknowledge the specific needs of women, such as the necessity of specific policies like the strong investment of states in reducing [[maternal mortality]] can be a form of discrimination. In this regard treating women and men similarly does not work because certain biological aspects such as menstruation, pregnancy, labor, childbirth, breastfeeding, as well as certain medical conditions, only affect women. The [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] stipulates in its ''General recommendation No. 35 on gender based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19'' that states should "Examine  gender neutral  laws  and  policies  to  ensure  that  they  do  not  create  or perpetuate existing inequalities and repeal or modify them if they do so". (paragraph 32).&lt;ref name="tbinternet.ohchr.org"&gt;http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/1_Global/CEDAW_C_GC_35_8267_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of gender neutral policy which harms women is that where medication tested in [[medical trial]]s only on men is also used on women assuming that there are no biological differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=4800017 | pmid=27011778 | doi=10.18549/PharmPract.2016.01.708 | volume=14 | issue=1 | title=Women's involvement in clinical trials: historical perspective and future implications | year=2016 | journal=Pharm Pract (Granada) | page=708 | last1 = Liu | first1 = KA | last2 = Mager | first2 = NA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Health]] is defined by the World Health Organization as "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/about/who-we-are/constitution|title=Constitution|website=www.who.int|language=en|access-date=2019-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Women's health]] refers to the health of women, which differs from that of men in many unique ways. Women's health is severely impaired in some parts of the world, due to factors such as inequality, confinement of women to the home, indifference of medical workers, lack of autonomy of women, lack of financial resources of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/womens_health/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Women's health|website=WHO|access-date=2019-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; Discrimination against women occurs also through denial of medical services that are only needed by women.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; Violations of women's right to health may result in [[maternal death]], accounting for more than 300.000 deaths per year, most of them in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/maternal-mortality|title=Maternal mortality|website=www.who.int|language=en|access-date=2019-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain traditional practices, such as [[female genital mutilation]], also affect women's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/female-genital-mutilation|title=Female genital mutilation|website=www.who.int|language=en|access-date=2019-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, young women and adolescent girls are the population most affected by [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/hiv-and-aids/facts-and-figures&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to education===

[[File:First Iranian women university.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|First group of women who entered university in Iran]]
The right to [[education]] is a universal entitlement to education.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/en/events/womensday/2011/pdfs/Infonote_Women_and_the_right_to_education.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]] prohibits discrimination in education, with discrimination being defined as "any distinction, exclusion, limitation or preference which, being based on race, colour, ''sex'', language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, economic condition or birth, has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing equality of treatment in education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=12949&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Convention against Discrimination in Education|work=unesco.org|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] states at Article 3 that "The States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all economic, social and cultural rights set forth in the present Covenant", with Article 13 recognizing "the right of everyone to education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx|title=International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|work=ohchr.org|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While women's right to access to academic education is recognized as very important, it is increasingly recognized that academic education must be supplemented with education on [[human rights]], [[non-discrimination]], [[ethics]] and [[gender equality]], in order for social advancement to be possible. This was pointed out by [[Prince Zeid bin Ra'ad|Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein]], the current [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]], who stressed the importance of human rights education for all children: "What good was it to humanity that [[Josef Mengele]] had advanced degrees in medicine and anthropology, given that he was capable of committing the most inhuman crimes? Eight of the 15 people who planned the [[Holocaust]] at Wannsee in 1942 held PhDs. They shone academically, and yet they were profoundly toxic to the world. [[Radovan Karadžić]] was a trained psychiatrist. [[Pol Pot]] studied radio electronics in Paris. Does this matter, when neither of them showed the smallest shred of ethics and understanding?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15482&amp;LangID=E|title=Keynote speech by Mr. Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights at the Conference on "Education for Peace" Palais des Nations, Geneva, 14 January 2015|work=ohchr.org|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been increased attention given in recent decades to the raising of student awareness to the importance of gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teachunicef.org/explore/topic/gender-equality |title=Gender Equality |publisher=TeachUNICEF |date= |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legal rights====
Reproductive rights are [[legal right]]s and freedoms relating to [[Human reproduction|reproduction]] and [[reproductive health]]. Reproductive rights were endorsed by the twenty-year Cairo Programme of Action which was adopted in 1994 at the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD) in [[Cairo]], and by the [[Beijing Declaration]] and [[Beijing Platform for Action]] in 1995.

In the 1870s feminists advanced the concept of ''voluntary motherhood'' as a political critique of ''involuntary motherhood''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gordon| first = Linda| title = The moral property of women: a history of birth control politics in America| publisher = University of Illinois Press| year = 2002| page = 55 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Hwh2wGplDc4C&amp;dq=voluntary+motherhood | isbn = 978-0-252-02764-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and expressing a desire for women's emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gordon| first = Linda| title = The moral property of women: a history of birth control politics in America| publisher = University of Illinois Press| year = 2002| page = 56 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Hwh2wGplDc4C&amp;dq=voluntary+motherhood | isbn = 978-0-252-02764-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates for voluntary motherhood disapproved of [[contraception]], arguing that women should only engage in sex for the purpose of [[procreation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gordon| first = Linda| title = The moral property of women: a history of birth control politics in America| publisher = University of Illinois Press| year = 2002| page = 57 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Hwh2wGplDc4C&amp;dq=voluntary+motherhood | isbn = 978-0-252-02764-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and advocated for periodic or permanent [[abstinence]].&lt;ref name="Gordon 2002 59"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gordon| first = Linda| title = The moral property of women: a history of birth control politics in America| publisher = University of Illinois Press| year = 2002| page = 59 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Hwh2wGplDc4C&amp;dq=voluntary+motherhood | isbn = 978-0-252-02764-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive rights represents a broad concept, that may include some or all of the following rights: the right to legal or safe abortion, the right to [[Birth control|control one's reproductive functions]], the right to access quality [[reproductive health]]care, and the right to [[family planning|education and access]] in order to make reproductive choices free from [[coercion]], discrimination, and violence.&lt;ref name="AMNESTY"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/Stop_Violence_Against_Women_SVAW/Reproductive_Rights/page.do?id=1108242&amp;n1=3&amp;n2=39&amp;n3=1101 |title=Stop Violence Against Women: Reproductive rights |accessdate=8 December 2007 |author=Amnesty International USA |year=2007 |work=SVAW |publisher=Amnesty International USA |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120140923/http://www.amnestyusa.org/Stop_Violence_Against_Women_SVAW/Reproductive_Rights/page.do?id=1108242&amp;n1=3&amp;n2=39&amp;n3=1101 |archivedate=20 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductive rights may also be understood to include [[sex education|education]] about [[contraception]] and [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]].&lt;ref name="COOK" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AMNESTY" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Template"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nocirc.org/symposia/fourth/zavales4.html |title=Template |publisher=Nocirc.org |date=10 December 1993 |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductive rights are often defined to include freedom from [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM), and [[forced abortion]] and [[forced sterilization]].&lt;ref name="COOK" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AMNESTY" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Template"/&gt; The Istanbul Convention recognizes these two rights at Article 38 – Female genital mutilation and Article 39 – Forced abortion and forced sterilisation.&lt;ref name="Istanbul"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm|title=Council of Europe – Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (CETS No. 210)|work=coe.int|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, reproductive rights activists promoted women's right to bodily autonomy, with these social movements leading to the gain of legal access to contraception and abortion during the next decades in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jofreeman.com/photos/MFWL.html|title=The March for Women's Lives, April 2004|website=www.jofreeman.com|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Birth control====
[[File:Birth Control Review 1919.jpg|upright=1.1|thumb|Cover of the 1919 ''Birth Control Review'', published by [[Margaret Sanger]]. In relation to "How shall we change the law?"

====Abortion====
[[File:Black March in support of abortion rights, Łódź October 2nd 2016 33.jpg|thumb|right|Access to abortion services varies considerably throughout the world, with the status of related rights being an active and major political topic in many nations.]]

Women's reproductive rights may be understood as including the right to easy access to a safe and legal abortion. [[Abortion law]]s vary from a full prohibition (the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Malta, Nicaragua, the Vatican)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/aug/22/chile-abortion-bill-michelle-bachelet-a-triumph-of-reason-ease-abortion-ban|title='A triumph of reason': Chile approves landmark bill to ease abortion ban|last=Kozak|first=Piotr|date=2017-08-22|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-06-17|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; to countries [[Abortion in Canada|such as Canada]], where there are no legal restrictions. In many countries where abortion is permitted by law, women may only have limited access to safe abortion services. In some countries abortion is permitted only to save the pregnant woman's life, or if the pregnancy resulted from rape or [[incest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415084202/http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/policy/WorldAbortionPolicies2013/WorldAbortionPolicies2013_WallChart.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=2016-04-15|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are also countries where the law is liberal, but in practice it is very difficult to have an abortion, due to most doctors being [[conscientious objectors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/italian-gynaecologists-refuse-abortions-miscarriages|title=Seven in 10 Italian gynaecologists refuse to carry out abortions|last=Duncan|first=Stephanie Kirchgaessner Pamela|date=2016-03-11|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-06-17|last2=Nardelli|first2=Alberto|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|last3=Robineau|first3=Delphine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://balkaninsight.com/2017/02/14/doctors-refusal-to-perform-abortions-divides-croatia-02-13-2017/|title=Doctors' Refusal to Perform Abortions Divides Croatia|date=2017-02-14|website=Balkan Insight|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that in some countries where abortion is legal it is ''[[de facto]]'' very difficult to have access to one is controversial; the UN in its 2017 resolution on ''Intensification of efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls: domestic violence'' urged states to guarantee access to "safe abortion where such services are permitted by national law".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/71/170|title=United Nations Official Document|website=www.un.org|access-date=2019-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] considers the criminalization of abortion a "violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights" and a form of "gender based violence"; paragraph 18 of its ''General recommendation No. 35 on gender based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19'' states that: "Violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights, such as forced sterilizations, forced abortion, forced pregnancy, criminalisation of abortion, denial or delay of  safe  abortion  and  post abortion  care,  forced  continuation  of pregnancy,  abuse  and mistreatment  of  women  and  girls  seeking  sexual  and  reproductive  health  information, goods and services, are forms of [[violence against women|gender based violence]] that, depending on   the circumstances, may amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment."&lt;ref name="tbinternet.ohchr.org"/&gt; The same ''General Recommendation'' also urges countries at paragraph 31 to [...] In particular, repeal:
a) Provisions  that  allow,  tolerate  or  condone  forms  of  gender based  violence against women, including [...] legislation  that  criminalises  abortion".&lt;ref name="tbinternet.ohchr.org"/&gt;

According to [[Human Rights Watch]], "Abortion is a highly emotional subject and one that excites deeply held opinions. However, equitable access to safe abortion services is first and foremost a human right. Where abortion is safe and legal, no one is forced to have one. Where abortion is illegal and unsafe, women are forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term or suffer serious health consequences and even death. Approximately 13% of maternal deaths worldwide are attributable to unsafe abortion—between 68,000 and 78,000 deaths annually."&lt;ref name="hrw"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/women/abortion.html |title=Human Rights Watch: Women's Human Rights: Abortion |date=12 November 2008 |accessdate=9 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112153841/http://www.hrw.org/women/abortion.html |archivedate=12 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Human Rights Watch, "the denial of a pregnant woman's right to make an independent decision regarding abortion violates or poses a threat to a wide range of human rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/americas/argentina0605/ |title=Q&amp;A: Human Rights Law and Access to Abortion |publisher=Hrw.org |accessdate=30 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081114110907/http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/americas/argentina0605/ |archivedate=14 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/americas/argentina0605/#issue |title=Q&amp;A: Human Rights Law and Access to Abortion |publisher=Hrw.org |accessdate=30 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081114110907/http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/americas/argentina0605/#issue |archivedate=14 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One can argue that even though women die from unsafe abortion, the legalization of abortion is considered a human right violation since it supports a cause that deprives the unborn of their humanity, which must be respected, and therefore another solution is needed in order to avoid maternal deaths (e.g., psychological and physiological support during and after pregnancy) whilst also avoiding abortion. According to World Health Organization, 56 million abortions on average occurred worldwide each year in 2010-2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/news/440KeyAbortionFactsFinal.pdf?ua=1 |title=Induced Abortion Worldwide |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; African American women are 5 times likely to have an abortion rather than a white woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2008/08/abortion-and-women-color-bigger-picture|title=Abortion and Women of Color: The Bigger Picture|date=2008-08-13|work=Guttmacher Institute|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Church]] and many other [[Christianity|Christian faiths]], particularly those considered the [[Christian right]], and most [[Judaism and abortion|Orthodox Jews]] regard abortion not as a right, but as a [[moral evil]] and a [[Mortal sin]].&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church 2271.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia was the first country to legalise abortions and offer free medical care in state hospitals to do so. After the [[October Revolution]], the Women's wing of the [[Bolshevik]] Party (the Zhenotdel) persuaded the Bolsheviks to legalise abortion (as a 'temporary measure'). The Bolsheviks legalised abortion in November 1920. This was the first time in world history that women had won the right to free abortions in state hospitals.&lt;ref name="Porter 1987 43"/&gt;

====Abuse during childbirth====
{{Main|Abuse during childbirth}}
[[Abuse during childbirth|The abuse of women during childbirth]] is a recently identified global problem and a basic violation of a woman's rights.&lt;ref name = who1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/maternal_perinatal/statement-childbirth/en/|title=Prevention and elimination of disrespect and abuse during childbirth|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = who2&gt;{{cite web | url = http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/134588/1/WHO_RHR_14.23_eng.pdf?ua=1&amp;ua=1 | title = The prevention and elimination of disrespect and abuse during facility-based childbirth | accessdate = 3 August 2017 | publisher = World Health organization }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abuse during childbirth is the [[neglect]], [[physical abuse]] and lack of respect during [[childbirth]]. This treatment is regarded as a violation of the woman's rights. It also has the effect of preventing women from seeking [[pre-natal care]] and using other health care services.

====Child marriage====
{{Main|Child marriage}}
[[File:2007 - 2012, Adolescent birth rate per 1000 women world map.svg|thumb|250px|Birth rates per 1,000 women aged 15–19 years, worldwide.]]
Child marriage is a practice which is widespread across the world, and is often connected to poverty and gender inequality. Child marriage endangers the [[reproductive health]] of young girls, leading to an increased risk of complications in pregnancy or childbirth. Such complications are a leading cause of death among girls in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unfpa.org/child-marriage|title=Child marriage|website=www.unfpa.org|language=en|access-date=2019-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2013/child_marriage_20130307/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Child marriages: 39 000 every day|website=WHO|access-date=2019-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-protection/child-marriage/|title=Child marriage|website=UNICEF DATA|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Forced pregnancy====
{{Main|Forced pregnancy}}
Forced pregnancy is the practice of forcing a woman or girl to become [[pregnant]], often as part of a [[forced marriage]], including by means of [[bride kidnapping]], through rape (including [[marital rape]], [[war rape]] and [[genocidal rape]]) or as part of a program of breeding [[slave]]s (see [[Slave breeding in the United States]]). It is a form of [[reproductive coercion]], was common historically, and still occurs in parts of the world. In the 20th century, state mandated forced marriage with the aim of increasing the population was practiced by some authoritarian governments, notably during the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in [[Cambodia]], which systematically forced people into marriages ordering them to have children, in order to increase the population and continue the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Anderson | first = Natalae | title = Memorandum: Charging forced marriage as a crime against humanity | url =http://www.d.dccam.org/Abouts/Intern/Natalae_Forced_marriage.pdf | publisher = Documentation Center of Cambodia | date = 22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forced pregnancy is strongly connected to the custom of [[bride price]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bawah | first1 = Ayaga Agula | last2 = Akweongo | first2 = Patricia | last3 = Simmons | first3 = Ruth | last4 = Phillips | first4 = James F. | title = Women's fears and men's anxieties: the impact of family planning on gender relations in Northern Ghana | journal = [[Studies in Family Planning]] | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 54&amp;ndash;66 | date = 1999 | url = https://www.popcouncil.org/research/womens-fears-and-mens-anxieties-the-impact-of-family-planning-on-gender-rel | ref = harv | doi = 10.1111/j.1728-4465.1999.00054.x }} [http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/councilarticles/sfp/SFP301Bawah.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom from violence===
[[Violence against women]] is, collectively, violent acts that are primarily or exclusively committed against women. The UN [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] states, "violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women" and "violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men."&lt;ref name="un-documents.net"/&gt; The [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], also known as the Istanbul Convention, provides the following definition of violence against women: "violence against women" is understood as a violation of human rights and a form of discrimination against women and shall mean all acts of gender-based violence that result in, or are likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list|title=Full list|website=Treaty Office|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence against women may be perpetrated by individuals, by groups, or by the State. It may occur in private or in public. Violence against women may be sexual violence, physical violence, psychological violence, socioeconomic violence. Some forms of violence against women have long cultural traditions: [[honor killing]]s, [[Dowry death|dowry violence]], [[female genital mutilation]]. Violence against women is considered by the World Health Organization "a major public health problem and a violation of women's human rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/violence-against-women|title=Violence against women|website=www.who.int|language=en|access-date=2019-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family law===
Under male dominated [[family law]], women had few, if any, rights, being under the control of the husband or male relatives. Legal concepts that existed throughout the centuries, such as [[coverture]], [[marital power]], [[Head and Master law]]s, kept women under the strict control of their husbands. Restrictions from marriage laws also extended to public life, such as [[marriage bar]]s. Practices such as [[dowry]] or [[bride price]] were, and still are to this day in some parts of the world, very common. Some countries continue to require to this day a [[Wali (Islamic legal guardian)|male guardian]] for women, without whom women cannot exercise civil rights. Other harmful practices include marriage of young girls, often to much older men.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;

In the subsequent decades women's rights again became an important issue in the English speaking world. By the 1960s the movement was called "feminism" or "women's liberation." Reformers wanted the same pay as men, equal rights in law, and the freedom to plan their families or not have children at all. Their efforts were met with mixed results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jofreeman.com/feminism/suffrage.htm |title=Waves of Feminism |publisher=Jofreeman.com |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Council of Women]] (ICW) was the first women's organization to work across national boundaries for the common cause of advocating human rights for women. In March and April 1888, women leaders came together in Washington D.C. with 80 speakers and 49 delegates representing 53 women's organizations from 9 countries: Canada, the United States, Ireland, India, England, Finland, Denmark, France and Norway. Women from professional organizations, trade unions, arts groups and benevolent societies participate. National Councils are affiliated to the ICW and thus make themselves heard at international level. In 1904, the ICW met in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Helene Stöcker (2015): Lebenserinnerungen, hg. von Reinhold Lütgeeier-Davin u. Kerstin Wolff. Köln: Böhlau, 93, pp. 100–01.&lt;/ref&gt; The ICW worked with the [[League of Nations]] during the 1920s and the [[United Nations]] post-World War II. Today the ICW holds Consultative Status with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]], the highest accreditation an NGO can achieve at the United Nations. Currently, it is composed of 70 countries and has a headquarters in Lasaunne, Switzerland. International meetings are held every three years.

In the UK, a public groundswell of opinion in favour of legal equality had gained pace, partly through the extensive employment of women in what were traditional male roles during both world wars. By the 1960s the legislative process was being readied, tracing through MP [[Willie Hamilton]]'s [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]] report, his equal pay for equal work bill,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/620037.stm |work=BBC News | title=Tributes paid to veteran anti-royalist | date=27 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; the creation of a Sex Discrimination Board, [[Lady Sear]]'s draft sex anti-discrimination bill, a government [[Green Paper]] of 1973, until 1975 when the first British Sex Discrimination Act, an Equal Pay Act, and an [[Equal Opportunities Commission (United Kingdom)|Equal Opportunities Commission]] came into force.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, 29 December 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 29 December 1975 "Sex discrimination in advertising banned".&lt;/ref&gt; With encouragement from the UK government, the other countries of the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] soon followed suit with an agreement to ensure that discrimination laws would be phased out across the European Community.

In the US, the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) was created in 1966 with the purpose of bringing about equality for all women. NOW was one important group that fought for the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA). This amendment stated that "equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of [[gender|sex]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.now.org/history/purpos66.html |title=The National Organization for Women's 1966 Statement of Purpose |publisher=Now.org |date=29 October 1966 |accessdate=30 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902232426/http://www.now.org/history/purpos66.html |archivedate=2 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; But there was disagreement on how the proposed amendment would be understood. Supporters believed it would guarantee women equal treatment. But critics feared it might deny women the right be financially supported by their husbands. The amendment died in 1982 because not enough states had ratified it. ERAs have been included in subsequent Congresses, but have still failed to be ratified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/national-organization-for-women?cat=biz-fin&amp;nr=1 |title=National Organization for Women: Definition and Much More from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Women for Women International]] (WfWI) is a nonprofit humanitarian organization that provides practical and moral support to women survivors of war. WfWI helps such women rebuild their lives after war's devastation through a year-long tiered program that begins with direct financial aid and emotional counseling and includes life skills (e.g., literacy, numeracy) training if necessary, rights awareness education, health education, job skills training and small business development. The organization was co-founded in 1993 by [[Zainab Salbi]], an [[Iraqi American]] who is herself a survivor of the [[Iran–Iraq War]] and Salbi's then-husband [[Amjad Atallah]]. Since June 2012, WfWI has been led by Afshan Khan, a long-time former executive with UNICEF who became WfWI's first new CEO since founder Zainab Salbi stepped down to devote more time to her writing and lecturing.&lt;ref&gt;"Women for Women International Names Afshan Khan New CEO."

===United Nations and World Conferences===
In 1946 the United Nations established a [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women|Commission on the Status of Women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/Review/|title=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Division for the Advancement of Women}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/CSW60YRS/CSWbriefhistory.pdf|title=Short History of the Commission on the Status of Women}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally as the Section on the Status of Women, Human Rights Division, Department of Social Affairs, and now part of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC). Since 1975 the UN has held a series of world conferences on women's issues, starting with the World Conference of the International Women's Year in Mexico City. These conferences created an international forum for women's rights, but also illustrated divisions between women of different cultures and the difficulties of attempting to apply principles universally.&lt;ref name=Catagay&gt;Catagay, N., Grown, C. and Santiago, A. 1986. "The Nairobi Women's Conference: Toward a Global Feminism?" Feminist Studies, 12, 2:401–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Four World Conferences have been held, the first in [[Mexico City]] ([[International Women's Year]], 1975), the second in [[Copenhagen]] (1980) and the third in [[Nairobi]] (1985).

At the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in Beijing (1995), ''[[Beijing Platform for Action|The Platform for Action]]'' was signed. This included a commitment to achieve "[[gender equality]] and the empowerment of women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/index.html|title=Fourth World Conference on Women.

In 2010, [[UN Women]] was founded by merging of [[Division for the Advancement of Women]], [[International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women]], [[Office of the Special Adviser or Gender Issues Advancement of Women]] and [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] by [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] Resolution 63/311.

===World Bank===
A 2019 report from the [[World Bank]] found that women have full legal rights to men in only six countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Latvia, Luxembourg and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/02/europe/world-bank-gender-equality-report-intl/index.html|title=Only six countries have equal rights for men and women, World Bank finds|last=CNN|first=Rob Picheta and Kieron Mirchandani|website=CNN|access-date=2019-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Field organisations===
Regions where women's rights are less developed have produced interesting local organisations, such as:
* [[IIDA Women's Development Organisation]], a [[Somali people|Somali]] [[non-governmental organisation]], created by women in order to work for [[peacebuilding]] and women's rights defence in [[Somalia]], a country deprived of state structures and security since 1991,
* the [[All Pakistan Women's Association]], a [[civil society]] organisation founded in 1949, which develops a range of programmes in the field of health, nutrition, education, [[birth control]] and legal aid.

==Human rights==

===United Nations convention===
{{Main|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women}}
[[File:CEDAW Participation.svg|right|upright=1.8|thumb|Participation in the CEDAW {{Col-begin}}{{Col-2}}{{legend|#00aa00|Signed and ratified}}{{legend|#008000|Acceded or succeeded}}{{legend|#008080|Unrecognized state, abiding by treaty}}{{Col-2}}{{legend|#eeee00|Only signed}}{{legend|#ff1111|Non-signatory}}{{Col-end}}]]

The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted in 1948, enshrines "the equal rights of men and women", and addressed both the equality and equity issues.&lt;ref name=Human&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1979, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) for legal implementation of the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]]. Described as an international [[bill of rights]] for [[woman|women]], it came into force on 3 September 1981. The UN member states that have not ratified the convention are Iran, Palau, Somalia, Sudan, Tonga, and the United States. [[Niue]] and the Vatican City, which are non-member states, have also not ratified it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en|title=UNTC|work=un.org|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest state to become a party to the convention is South Sudan, on 30 April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title=UNTC |publisher=Treaties.un.org |date= |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention defines discrimination against women in the following terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It also establishes an agenda of action for putting an end to sex-based discrimination for which states ratifying the Convention are required to enshrine [[gender equality]] into their domestic legislation, repeal all discriminatory provisions in their laws, and enact new provisions to guard against discrimination against women. They must also establish tribunals and public institutions to guarantee women effective protection against discrimination, and take steps to eliminate all forms of discrimination practiced against women by individuals, organizations, and enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]], Article 2 (e).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage, divorce, and family law===
Article 16 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] enshrines the right of consenting men and women to marry and found a family.&lt;ref name=Human /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"(1) Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family. They are entitled to equal rights as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mensuck.com/40-basic-rights-women-did-not-have-until-the-1970s/|title=40 Basic Rights Women Did Not Have Until The 1970s|accessdate=29 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses.&lt;br /&gt;
(3) The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Article 16 of CEDAW stipulates that, "1. States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in all matters relating to marriage and family relations [...]".&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm#article16|title=CEDAW 29th Session 30 June to 25 July 2003|work=un.org|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the rights included are a woman's right to freely and consensually choose her spouse; to have parental rights to her children irrespective of her marital status; the right of a married woman to choose a profession or an occupation, and to have property rights within marriage. In addition to these, "The betrothal and the marriage of a child shall have no legal effect".&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;

[[Polygamous marriage]] is a controversial practice, prevalent in some parts of the world. The General recommendations made by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, state at ''General Recommendation No. 21, Equality in marriage and family relations''
"14.[...] Polygamous marriage contravenes a woman's right to equality with men, and can have such serious emotional and financial consequences for her and her dependents that such marriages ought to be discouraged and prohibited."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/recommendations/recomm.htm|title=General recommendations made by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women|work=un.org|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cohabitation]] of unmarried couples as well as [[single mother]]s are common in some parts the world. The [[Human Rights Committee]] has stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/gencomm/hrcom28.htm|title=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library|work=umn.edu|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"27. In giving effect to recognition of the family in the context of article 23, it is important to accept the concept of the various forms of family, including unmarried couples and their children and single parents and their children and to ensure the equal treatment of women in these contexts (General Comment 19 paragraph 2 last sentence). Single parent families frequently consist of a single woman caring for one or more children, and States parties should describe what measures of support are in place to enable her to discharge her parental functions on the basis of equality with a man in a similar position."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action===
{{Main|Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action}}
The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, also known as VDPA, is a human rights declaration adopted by consensus at the [[World Conference on Human Rights]] on 25 June 1993 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. This declaration recognizes women's rights as being protected human rights. Paragraph 18 reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/Vienna.aspx |title=Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action |publisher=Ohchr.org |date= |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The human rights of women and of the girl-child are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights. The full and equal participation of women in political, civil, economic, social and cultural life, at the national, regional and international levels, and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on grounds of sex are priority objectives of the international community".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325===
{{Main|United Nations Security Council Resolution}}
On 31 October 2000, the [[United Nations Security Council]] unanimously adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325]], the first formal and legal document from the United Nations Security Council that requires all states to respect fully [[international humanitarian law]] and [[international human rights law]] applicable to the rights and protection of women and girls during and after the [[armed conflicts]].

===Maputo Protocol===
{{Main|Maputo Protocol}}
The Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa, better known as the [[Maputo Protocol]], was adopted by the [[African Union]] on 11 July 2003 at its second summit in [[Maputo]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0307/S00279.htm African Union: Rights of Women Protocol Adopted], press release, [[Amnesty International]], 22 July 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Mozambique.

==Violence against women==

===United Nations Declaration===
The [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] was adopted by the United Nations in 1993. It defines [[violence against women]] as "''any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm|title=A/RES/48/104 – Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women – UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|author=United Nations General Assembly|work=un-documents.net|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resolution established that women have a right to be free from violence. As a consequence of the resolution, in 1999, the General Assembly declared the day of 25 November to be the [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]].

Article 2 of The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women outlines several forms of violence against women:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Article Two:
Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following:

:(a) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including [[Battery (crime)|battering]], sexual abuse of female children in the household, [[dowry]]-related violence, [[marital rape]], [[female genital mutilation]] and other traditional practices harmful to women, non-spousal violence and violence related to [[Sexual exploitation|exploitation]];
:(b) Physical, sexual and [[psychological abuse|psychological violence]] occurring within the general community, including [[rape]], [[sexual abuse]], [[sexual harassment]] and intimidation at work, in educational institutions and elsewhere, [[Human trafficking|trafficking]] in women and [[forced prostitution]];
:(c) Physical, sexual and psychological violence perpetrated or condoned by the State, wherever it occurs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Istanbul Convention===
The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], also known as the Istanbul Convention, is the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of domestic violence and violence against women,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oas.org/es/mesecvi/docs/CSW-SideEvent2014-Flyer-EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and came into force in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bureau des Traités |url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=210&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG |title=Liste complète |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |date= |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Countries which ratify it must ensure that the forms of violence defined in its text are outlawed. In its Preamble, the Convention states that "the realisation of ''de jure'' and ''de facto'' equality between women and men is a key element in the prevention of violence against women". The Convention also provides a definition of [[domestic violence]] as "all acts of physical, sexual, psychological or economic violence that occur within the family or domestic unit or between former or current spouses or partners, whether or not the perpetrator shares or has shared the same residence with the victim".&lt;ref name="Istanbul"/&gt; Although it is a Convention of the [[Council of Europe]], it is open to accession by any country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/convention-violence/thematic_factsheets/IC%20Global%20Tool_EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221131635/http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/convention-violence/thematic_factsheets/IC%20Global%20Tool_EN.pdf |archivedate=21 February 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rape and sexual violence===
{{Main|Rape|War rape|Violence against women}}
[[File:Chinese girl from one of the Japanese Army's 'comfort battalions'.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A young [[Chinese diaspora|ethnic Chinese]] woman who was in one of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]'s "comfort battalions" is interviewed by an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] officer (see [[Comfort women]]).]]
Rape, sometimes called [[sexual assault]], is an assault by a person involving [[sexual intercourse]] with or [[sexual penetration]] of another person without that person's [[consent]]. Rape is generally considered a serious [[sex crime]] as well as a civil assault. When part of a widespread and systematic practice, rape and [[sexual slavery]] are now recognised as a [[crime against humanity]] as well as a [[war crime]]. Rape is also now recognised as a form of [[genocide]] when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted group.

====As genocide====
{{Main|Rwandan genocide}}
In 1998, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] established by the United Nations made landmark decisions that rape is a crime of [[genocide]] under [[international law]]. The trial of [[Jean-Paul Akayesu]], the mayor of Taba Commune in Rwanda, established precedents that rape is an element of the crime of genocide. The Akayesu judgement includes the first interpretation and application by an international court of the 1948 [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]]. The Trial Chamber held that rape, which it defined as "a physical invasion of a sexual nature committed on a person under circumstances which are coercive", and sexual assault constitute acts of genocide insofar as they were committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted group. It found that sexual assault formed an integral part of the process of destroying the [[Tutsi]] ethnic group and that the rape was systematic and had been perpetrated against Tutsi women only, manifesting the specific intent required for those acts to constitute genocide.&lt;ref&gt;''The Prosecutor v. Jean-Paul Akayesu (Trial Judgement)'', ICTR-96-4-T, International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), 2 September 1998, [http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,ICTR,,,40278fbb4,0.html p. 166] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012031344/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher%2CICTR%2C%2C%2C40278fbb4%2C0.html |date=12 October 2012 }} ¶.733.

Judge [[Navanethem Pillay]] said in a statement after the verdict: "From time immemorial, rape has been regarded as one of the [[Wartime sexual violence|spoils of war]]. Now it will be considered a war crime.

====As a crime against humanity====
{{Main|Crimes against humanity}}
The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]] Explanatory Memorandum, which defines the jurisdiction of the [[International Criminal Court]], recognises rape, [[sexual slavery]], [[enforced prostitution]], [[forced pregnancy]], [[compulsory sterilization|enforced sterilization]], "or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity" as a [[Crimes against humanity|crime against humanity]] if the action is part of a widespread or systematic practice.&lt;ref name="Horton"&gt;As quoted by Guy Horton in ''[http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs3/Horton-2005.pdf Dying Alive&amp;nbsp;– A Legal Assessment of Human Rights Violations in Burma]'' April 2005, co-Funded by The Netherlands Ministry for Development Co-Operation.

Rape was first recognised as a [[crime against humanity]] when the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] issued arrest warrants based on the [[Geneva Conventions]] and Violations of the Laws or Customs of War. Specifically, it was recognised that Muslim women in [[Foča|Foca]] (southeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina) were subjected to systematic and widespread [[gang rape]], torture, and [[sexual enslavement]] by [[Bosnian Serb]] soldiers, policemen, and members of paramilitary groups after the takeover of the city in April 1992.&lt;ref name="haverford"&gt;[http://www.haverford.edu/relg/sells/rape.html Rape as a Crime Against Humanity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212122926/http://www.haverford.edu/relg/sells/rape.html |date=12 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The indictment was of major legal significance and was the first time that sexual assaults were investigated for the purpose of prosecution under the rubric of [[torture]] and [[enslavement]] as a crime against humanity.&lt;ref name="haverford"/&gt; The indictment was confirmed by a 2001 verdict by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] that rape and [[sexual enslavement]] are [[crimes against humanity]]. This ruling challenged the widespread acceptance of rape and sexual enslavement of women as intrinsic part of war.&lt;ref name=AmnestyInt2001feb22&gt;[http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR630042001?open&amp;of=ENG-BIH Bosnia and Herzegovina : Foca verdict&amp;nbsp;– rape and sexual enslavement are crimes against humanity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907091105/http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR630042001?open&amp;of=ENG-BIH |date=7 September 2009 }}. 22 February 2001. [[Amnesty International]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] found three Bosnian Serb men guilty of rape of [[Bosniak]] (Bosnian Muslim) women and girls (some as young as 12 and 15 years of age), in [[Foča|Foca]], eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina. Furthermore, two of the men were found guilty of the crime against humanity of [[sexual enslavement]] for holding women and girls captive in a number of de facto detention centres. Many of the women subsequently disappeared.&lt;ref name=AmnestyInt2001feb22/&gt;

===Forced marriage and slavery===
The 1956 [[Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery]] defines "institutions and practices similar to slavery" to include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/SupplementaryConventionAbolitionOfSlavery.aspx |title=Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery |publisher=Ohchr.org |date= |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

c) Any institution or practice whereby:
* (i) A woman, without the right to refuse, is promised or given in marriage on payment of a consideration in money or in kind to her parents, guardian, family or any other person or group; or
* (ii) The husband of a woman, his family, or his clan, has the right to transfer her to another person for value received or otherwise; or
* (iii) A woman on the death of her husband is liable to be inherited by another person;

The Istanbul Convention requires countries which ratify it to prohibit forced marriage (Article 37) and to ensure that forced marriages can be easily voided without further victimization (Article 32).&lt;ref name="Istanbul"/&gt;

===Trafficking Protocol===
The [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]] (also referred to as the ''Trafficking Protocol'' or ''UN TIP Protocol'') is a [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] to the [[Convention against Transnational Organised Crime]]. It is one of the three [[Palermo protocols]]. Its purpose is defined at ''Article 2. Statement of purpose'' as: "(a) To prevent and combat trafficking in persons, paying particular attention to women and children; (b) To protect and assist the victims of such trafficking, with full respect for their human rights; and (c) To promote cooperation among States Parties in order to meet those objectives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNTOC/Publications/TOC%20Convention/TOCebook-e.pdf |title=United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime And The Protocols Thereto |date= |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
