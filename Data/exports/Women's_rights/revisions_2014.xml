'''Women's rights''' are the rights and [[entitlements]] claimed for women and girls of many societies worldwide. In some places, these rights are institutionalized or supported by law, local custom, and behavior, whereas in others they may be ignored or suppressed. They differ from broader notions of human rights through claims of an inherent historical and traditional bias against the exercise of rights by women and girls in favour of men and boys.&lt;ref name=Hosken&gt;Hosken, Fran P., 'Towards a Definition of Women's Rights' in ''Human Rights Quarterly'', Vol. 3, No. 2. (May, 1981), pp. 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues commonly associated with notions of women's rights include, though are not limited to, the right: to bodily integrity and autonomy; to [[Women's suffrage|vote]] (suffrage); to hold public office; to work; to fair wages or equal pay; to [[right to property|own property]]; [[Right to education|to education]]; to serve in the military or be conscripted; to enter into legal contracts; and to have marital or parental rights.&lt;ref name=quarterly&gt;Lockwood, Bert B.

=== Ancient cultures ===

Although males seem to have dominated in many ancient cultures, there are some exceptions. For instance in the Nigerian Aka culture women may hunt, even on their own, and often control distribution of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Orr |first=Christopher |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/12/where-masturbation-and-homosexuality-do-not-exist/265849/ |title=Where Masturbation and Homosexuality Do Not Exist - Alice Dreger |publisher=The Atlantic |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Egypt had female rulers, such as [[Cleopatra]].

=== China ===

The status of women in China was low, largely due to the custom of [[foot binding]]. About 45% of Chinese women had bound feet in the 19th century. For the upper classes, it was almost 100%. In 1912, the Chinese government ordered the cessation of foot-binding. Foot-binding involved alteration of the bone structure so that the feet were only about 4 inches long. The bound feet caused difficulty of movement, thus greatly limiting the activities of women.

Due to the social custom that men and women should not be near to one another, the women of China were reluctant to be treated by male doctors of Western Medicine. This resulted in a tremendous need for female doctors of Western Medicine in China. Thus, female medical missionary Dr. Mary H. Fulton (1854–1927)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Inasmuch-Mary-H-Fulton/dp/1140341804 |title=Inasmuch: Mary H.

Hackett (1851–1916) of Indiana, USA. The College was aimed at the spreading of Christianity and modern medicine and the elevation of Chinese women's social status.&lt;ref name="RebeccaChan"&gt;Rebecca Chan Chung, Deborah Chung and Cecilia Ng Wong, "Piloted to Serve", 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="facebook"&gt;{{cite web|author=Piloted to Serve97 personen vinden dit leuk |url=https://www.facebook.com/PilotedToServe |title=Piloted to Serve |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greece ===

The status of women in [[ancient Greece]] varied form city state to city state. Records exist of women in ancient [[Delphi]], [[Gortyn]], [[Thessaly]], [[Megara]] and [[Sparta]] owning land, the most prestigious form of [[private property]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gerhard| first = Ute| title = Debating women’s equality: toward a feminist theory of law from a European perspective| publisher = Rutgers University Press| year = 2001| page = 33| url = http://books.google.com/?id=XMohyLfGDDsC&amp;dq=women+right+to+property| isbn = 978-0-8135-2905-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Athens]], women had no legal personhood and were assumed to be part of the [[oikos]] headed by the male [[Kurios|kyrios]]. Until marriage, women were under the guardianship of their father or other male relative. Once married, the husband became a woman's kyrios. As women were barred from conducting legal proceedings, the kyrios would do so on their behalf.&lt;ref name="google114"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Blundell| first =Sue| title = Women in ancient Greece, Volume 1995, Part 2| publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 1995| page = 114| url = http://books.google.com/?id=Xfx1VaSIOgQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=women+ancient+greece#v=onepage&amp;q=women%20athens&amp;f=false| isbn = 978-0-674-95473-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Athenian women had limited [[right to property]] and therefore were not considered full citizens, as citizenship and the entitlement to [[civil and political rights]] was defined in relation to property and the means to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gerhard| first = Ute| title = Debating women’s equality: toward a feminist theory of law from a European perspective| publisher = Rutgers University Press| year = 2001| page = 35| url = http://books.google.com/?id=XMohyLfGDDsC&amp;dq=women+right+to+property| isbn = 978-0-8135-2905-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, women could acquire rights over property through gifts, dowry and inheritance, though her kyrios had the right to dispose of a woman's property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Blundell| first =Sue| title = Women in ancient Greece, Volume 1995, Part 2| publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 1995| page = 115| url = http://books.google.com/?id=Xfx1VaSIOgQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=women+ancient+greece#v=onepage&amp;q=women%20athens&amp;f=false| isbn = 978-0-674-95473-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Athenian women could enter into a contract worth less than the value of a “[[Ancient Greek units of measurement#Volume|medimnos]] of barley” (a measure of grain), allowing women to engage in petty trading.&lt;ref name="google114"/&gt; Slaves, like women, were not eligible for full citizenship in ancient Athens, though in rare circumstances they could become citizens if freed. The only permanent barrier to citizenship, and hence full political and civil rights, in ancient Athens was gender. No women ever acquired citizenship in ancient Athens, and therefore women were excluded in principle and practice from ancient Athenian democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Robinson| first = Eric W.| title = Ancient Greek democracy: readings and sources| publisher = Wiley-Blackwell| year = 2004| page = 302| url = http://books.google.com/?id=Jug6crxEImIC&amp;dq=Aristophanes+ecclesiazusae+women%27s+rights| isbn = 978-0-631-23394-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, [[Sparta]]n women enjoyed a status, power, and respect that was unknown in the rest of the classical world. Although Spartan women were formally excluded from military and political life they enjoyed considerable status as mothers of Spartan warriors. As men engaged in military activity, women took responsibility for running estates. Following protracted warfare in the 4th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC Spartan women owned approximately between 35% and 40% of all Spartan land and property.&lt;ref name="Pomeroy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Tierney| first = Helen| title = Women’s studies encyclopaedia, Volume 2| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 1999| pages = 609–610| url = http://books.google.com/?id=2bDxJW3x4f8C&amp;dq=spartan+women| isbn = 978-0-313-31072-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the Hellenistic Period, some of the wealthiest Spartans were women.&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, Sarah B.

[[Plato]] acknowledged that extending civil and political rights to women would substantively alter the nature of the household and the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Robinson| first = Eric W.| title = Ancient Greek democracy: readings and sources| publisher = Wiley-Blackwell| year = 2004| page = 300| url = http://books.google.com/?id=Jug6crxEImIC&amp;dq=Aristophanes+ecclesiazusae+women%27s+rights| isbn = 978-0-631-23394-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]], who had been taught by Plato, denied that women were slaves or subject to property, arguing that "nature has distinguished between the female and the slave", but he considered wives to be "bought". He argued that women's main economic activity is that of safeguarding the household property created by men. According to Aristotle the labour of women added no value because "the art of household management is not identical with the art of getting wealth, for the one uses the material which the other provides".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gerhard| first = Ute| title = Debating women’s equality: toward a feminist theory of law from a European perspective| publisher = Rutgers University Press| year = 2001| pages = 32–35| url = http://books.google.com/?id=XMohyLfGDDsC&amp;dq=women+right+to+property| isbn = 978-0-8135-2905-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to these views, the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophers]] argued for equality of the sexes, sexual inequality being in their view contrary to the laws of nature.&lt;ref name="Colish"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Stoic Tradition from Antiquity to the Early Middle Ages: Stoicism in classical Latin literature |last=Colish |first=Marcia L. |year=1990 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-09327-0 |pages=37–38  |url=http://books.google.com/?id=WY-2MeZqoK0C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=stoics%2Bslavery#v=onepage&amp;q=stoics%2Bslavery&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, they followed the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], who argued that men and women should wear the same clothing and receive the same kind of education.&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt; They also saw marriage as a moral companionship between equals rather than a biological or social necessity, and practiced these views in their lives as well as their teachings.&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt; The Stoics adopted the views of the Cynics and added them to their own theories of human nature, thus putting their sexual egalitarianism on a strong philosophical basis.&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt;

=== Ancient Rome ===
{{Details|Women in ancient Rome}}
[[File:Fulvia Antonia.jpg|thumb|[[Fulvia]], the wife of [[Mark Antony]], commanded troops during the [[Roman civil wars]] and was the first woman whose likeness appeared on Roman coins.&lt;ref&gt;Fulvia was the first historical woman to appear on coins: [[List of Roman deities|goddesses]] and personifications appeared widely.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Freeborn women of [[ancient Rome]] were [[Roman citizenship|citizens]] who enjoyed legal privileges and protections that did not extend to [[peregrinus (Roman)|non-citizens]] or [[slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]]. [[Social class in ancient Rome|Roman society]], however, was [[patriarchal]], and women could not vote, hold [[Roman magistrate|public office]], or serve in the military.&lt;ref&gt;[[A.N. Sherwin-White]], ''Roman Citizenship'' (Oxford University Press, 1979), pp. 211 and 268; Bruce W. Frier and Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 31–32, 457, ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Women of the upper classes exercised political influence through marriage and motherhood. During the [[Roman Republic]], the [[Cornelia Africana|mother of the Gracchus brothers]] and [[Aurelia Cotta|of Julius Caesar]] were noted as exemplary women who advanced the career of their sons. During the [[Roman Empire|Imperial period]], women of the emperor's family could acquire considerable political power, and were regularly depicted in official art and on coinage. [[Plotina]] exercised influence on both her husband, the emperor [[Trajan]], and his successor [[Hadrian]]. Her letters and petitions on official matters were made available to the public&amp;nbsp;—an indication that her views were considered important to popular opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Eck, "The Emperor and His Advisors," ''Cambridge Ancient History'' (Cambridge University History, 2000), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

A child's citizen status was determined by that of its mother. Both daughters and sons were subject to ''[[patria potestas]]'', the power wielded by their father as head of household ''([[paterfamilias]])''. At the height of the Empire (1st–2nd centuries), the legal standing of daughters differs little if at all from that of sons.&lt;ref name="autogenerated19"&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Girls had equal inheritance rights with boys if their father died without leaving a will.&lt;ref&gt;David Johnston, ''Roman Law in Context'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), chapter 3.3; Frier and McGinn, '' A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', Chapter IV; Yan Thomas, "The Division of the Sexes in Roman Law," in ''A History of Women from Ancient Goddesses to Christian Saints'' (Harvard University Press, 1991), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dextrorum iunctio edited.JPG|thumb|left|Couple clasping hands in marriage, idealized by Romans as the building block of society and as a partnership of companions who work together to produce and rear children, manage everyday affairs, lead exemplary lives, and enjoy affection&lt;ref&gt;[[Martha C. Nussbaum]], "The Incomplete Feminism of Musonius Rufus, Platonist, Stoic, and Roman," in ''The Sleep of Reason: Erotic Experience and Sexual Ethics in Ancient Greece and Rome'' (University of Chicago Press, 2002), p. 300; Sabine MacCormack, "Sin, Citizenship, and the Salvation of Souls: The Impact of Christian Priorities on Late-Roman and Post-Roman Society," ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'' 39.4 (1997), p. 651.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the earliest period of the [[Roman Republic]], a bride passed from her father's control into the "hand" ''(manus)'' of her husband. She then became subject to her husband's ''potestas'', though to a lesser degree than their children.&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This archaic form of ''manus'' marriage was largely abandoned by the time of [[Julius Caesar]], when a woman remained under her father's authority by law even when she moved into her husband's home. This arrangement was one of the factors in the independence Roman women enjoyed relative to those of many other ancient cultures and up to the modern period:&lt;ref&gt;[[Eva Cantarella]], ''Pandora's Daughters: The Role and Status of Women in Greek and Roman Antiquity'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1987), pp. 140–141; J.P. Sullivan, "Martial's Sexual Attitudes," ''Philologus'' 123 (1979), p. 296, specifically on sexual freedom.&lt;/ref&gt; although she had to answer to her father in legal matters, she was free of his direct scrutiny in her daily life,&lt;ref&gt;Beryl Rawson, "The Roman Family," in ''The Family in Ancient Rome: New Perspectives'' (Cornell University Press, 1986), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and her husband had no legal power over her.&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', pp. 19–20, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; When her father died, she became legally emancipated ''([[sui iuris]])''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated19"/&gt; A married woman retained ownership of any property she brought into the marriage.&lt;ref name="autogenerated19"/&gt; Although it was a point of pride to be a "one-man woman" ''(univira)'' who had married only once, there was little stigma attached to [[Marriage in ancient Rome#Divorce|divorce]], nor to speedy remarriage after the loss of a husband through death or divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage: ''Iusti Coniuges'' from the Time of Cicero to the Time of Ulpian'' (Oxford University Press, 1991), pp. 258–259, 500–502 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Under classical [[Roman law]], a husband had no right to abuse his wife physically or compel her to have sex.&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Wife beating was sufficient grounds for divorce or other legal action against the husband.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett G. Fagan, "Violence in Roman Social Relations," in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 487.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because she remained legally a part of her birth family, a Roman woman kept her own [[Roman naming conventions|family name]] for life. Children most often took the father's name, but in the Imperial period sometimes made their mother's name part of theirs, or even used it instead.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, "The Roman Family," p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; A Roman mother's right to own property and to dispose of it as she saw fit, including setting the terms of her own will, enhanced her influence over her sons even when they were adults.&lt;ref&gt;Severy, ''Augustus and the Family,'' p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their legal status as citizens and the degree to which they could become emancipated, women could own property, enter contracts, and engage in business.&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law,'' p. 461; W.V. Harris, "Trade," in ''The Cambridge Ancient History: The High Empire A.D. 70–192'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), vol. 11, p. 733.&lt;/ref&gt; Some acquired and disposed of sizable fortunes, and are recorded in inscriptions as benefactors in funding major public works.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret L. Woodhull, "Matronly Patrons in the Early Roman Empire: The Case of Salvia Postuma," in ''Women's Influence on Classical Civilization'' (Routledge, 2004), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman women could appear in court and argue cases, though it was customary for them to be represented by a man.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Bauman, ''Women and Politics in Ancient Rome'' (Routledge, 1992, 1994), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; They were simultaneously disparaged as too ignorant and weak-minded to practice law, and as too active and influential in legal matters—resulting in an edict that limited women to conducting cases on their own behalf instead of others'.&lt;ref&gt;Bauman, ''Women and Politics'', pp. 50–51; Juvenal, ''Satire'' 6, on women busy in the courts.&lt;/ref&gt; Even after this restriction was put in place, there are numerous examples of women taking informed actions in legal matters, including dictating legal strategy to their male advocates.&lt;ref&gt;Bauman, ''Women and Politics'', pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bronze young girl reading CdM Paris.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronze statuette of a young woman reading (latter 1st century)]]
The first [[Roman emperor]], [[Augustus]], framed his ascent to sole power as a return to [[mos maiorum|traditional morality]], and attempted to regulate the conduct of women through [[Leges Iuliae|moral legislation]]. [[Marriage in ancient Rome#Adultery|Adultery]], which had been a private family matter under the Republic, was criminalized,&lt;ref&gt;Beth Severy, ''Augustus and the Family at the Birth of the Empire'' (Routledge, 2002; Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and defined broadly as an illicit sex act ''([[stuprum]])'' that occurred between a male citizen and a married woman, or between a married woman and any man other than her husband. That is, a [[double standard]] was in place: a married woman could have sex only with her husband, but a married man did not commit adultery when he had sex with a [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitute]], [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Master-slave relations|slave]], or person of marginalized status ''([[infamia|infamis]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas McGinn, "Concubinage and the Lex Iulia on Adultery," ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' 121 (1991), p. 342; Nussbaum, "The Incomplete Feminism of Musonius Rufus," p. 305, noting that custom "allowed much latitude for personal negotiation and gradual social change"; [[Elaine Fantham]], "''Stuprum'': Public Attitudes and Penalties for Sexual Offences in Republican Rome," in ''Roman Readings: Roman Response to Greek Literature from Plautus to Statius and Quintilian'' (Walter de Gruyter, 2011), p. 124, citing [[Papinian]], ''De adulteriis'' I and [[Modestinus]], ''Liber Regularum'' I.

[[Stoicism|Stoic philosophies]] influenced the development of Roman law. Stoics of the Imperial era such as [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Musonius Rufus]] developed theories of [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Stoic sexual morality|just relationships]]. While not advocating equality in society or under the law, they held that nature gives men and women equal capacity for virtue and equal obligations to act virtuously, and that therefore men and women had an equal need for philosophical education.&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt; These philosophical trends among the ruling elite are thought to have helped improve the status of women under the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ratnapala| first = Suri| title = Jurisprudence| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2009| pages =134–135 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=tNwdWlXxZt8C&amp;dq=Stoic+law+women| isbn = 978-0-521-61483-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome had no system of state-supported schooling, and education was available only to those who could pay for it. The daughters of [[Ordo senatorius|senators and knights]] seem to have regularly received a primary education (for ages 7 to 12).&lt;ref&gt;Marietta Horster, "Primary Education," in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of gender, few people were educated beyond that level. Girls from a modest background might be schooled in order to help with the family business or to acquire literacy skills that enabled them to work as scribes and secretaries.&lt;ref&gt;Beryl Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'' (Oxford University Press, 2003), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The woman who achieved the greatest prominence in the ancient world for her learning was [[Hypatia of Alexandria]], who taught advanced courses to young men and advised the Roman [[prefect of Egypt]] on politics. Her influence put her into conflict with the [[bishop of Alexandria]], [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]], who may have been implicated in her violent death in the year 415 at the hands of a Christian mob.&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Morgan, "Education," in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman law recognized [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Rape|rape]] as a crime in which the victim bore no guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Ariadne Staples, ''From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins: Sex and Category in Roman Religion'' (Routledge, 1998), pp. 81–82; Jane F. Gardner, ''Women in Roman Law and Society'' (Indiana University Press, 1991), pp. 118ff. Roman law also recognized [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#The rape of men|rape committed against males]].&lt;/ref&gt; Rape was a capital crime.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the ''cinaedus'' and the Roman Law against Love between Men," ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'' 3.4 (1993), pp. 562–563.&lt;/ref&gt; The right to physical integrity was fundamental to the Roman concept of citizenship, as indicated in [[Roman mythology|Roman legend]] by the rape of [[Lucretia]] by the king's son. After speaking out against the tyranny of the royal family, Lucretia killed herself as a political and moral protest. Roman authors saw her self-sacrifice as the catalyst for overthrowing the monarchy and establishing the republic.&lt;ref&gt;Ann L. Kuttner, "Culture and History at Pompey's Museum," ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' 129 (1999), p. 348; [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F.

ISBN 0-8156-2908-7 (pbk); p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; From 610 and 661, known as the [[early reforms under Islam]], the Qur'an introduced fundamental reforms to customary law and introduced rights for women in marriage, divorce, and [[Islamic inheritance jurisprudence|inheritance]]. By providing that the wife, not her family, would receive a dowry from the husband, which she could administer as her personal property, the Qur'an made women a legal party to the marriage contract.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (with DeLong-Bas) 2001, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

While in customary law, inheritance was limited to male descendants, the Qur'an introduced rules on inheritance with certain fixed shares being distributed to designated heirs, first to the nearest female relatives and then the nearest male relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (with DeLong-Bas) 2001, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Annemarie Schimmel]] "compared to the pre-Islamic position of women, [[Fiqh|Islamic legislation]] meant an enormous progress; the woman has the right, at least according to the [[Letter and spirit of the law|letter of the law]], to administer the wealth she has brought into the family or has earned by her own work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Schimmel| first = Annemarie| title = Islam | publisher = SUNY Press| year = 1992| page = 65| url = http://books.google.com/?id=m7oKd-H1BzYC&amp;dq=compared+to+the+pre-Islamic+position+of+women,+Islamic+legislation+meant+an+enormous+progress%3B+the+woman+has+the+right,+at+least+according+to+the+letter+of+the+law,+to+administer+the+wealth+she+has+brought+into+the+family+or+has+earned+by+her+own+work| isbn = 978-0-7914-1327-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Middle Ages ===
According to [[English Common Law]], which developed from the 12th century onward, all property which a wife held at the time of marriage became a possession of her husband. Eventually English courts forbade a husband's transferring property without the consent of his wife, but he still retained the right to manage it and to receive the money which it produced. French married women suffered from restrictions on their legal capacity which were removed only in 1965.&lt;ref name=Badr-1984&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Islamic Criminal Justice|first=Gamal M.|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=32|issue=1|date=Winter 1984|pages=167–169 |doi=10.2307/840274|ref=harv|author2=Mayer, Ann Elizabeth|publisher=American Society of Comparative Law|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|jstor=840274}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th century, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in Europe allowed more women to add their voices, including the English writers [[Jane Anger]], [[Emilia Lanier|Aemilia Lanyer]], and the prophetess [[Anna Trapnell]].

Starting in the late 18th century, and throughout the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, rights, as a concept and claim, gained increasing political, social, and philosophical importance in Europe. Movements emerged which demanded [[freedom of religion]], the abolition of [[slavery]], rights for women, rights for those who did not own property, and [[universal suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Sweet| first = William| title = Philosophical theory and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights| publisher = University of Ottawa Press| year = 2003| page = 4| url = http://books.google.com/?id=_V_KuJGcJSAC&amp;dq=%22natural+law%22+women+%22human+nature%22| isbn =978-0-7766-0558-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 18th century the question of women's rights became central to political debates in both France and Britain. At the time some of the greatest thinkers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], who defended democratic principles of [[Egalitarianism|equality]] and challenged notions that a privileged few should rule over the vast majority of the population, believed that these principles should be applied only to their own gender and their own race. The philosopher [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]], for example, thought that it was the order of nature for woman to obey men. He wrote "Women do wrong to complain of the inequality of man-made laws" and claimed that "when she tries to usurp our rights, she is our inferior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Lauren| first = Paul Gordon| title = The evolution of international human rights: visions seen| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2003| pages = 29 &amp; 30| url = http://books.google.com/?id=gHRhWgbWyzMC&amp;dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Man+and+of+the+Citizen| id = | isbn =978-0-8122-1854-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The efforts of [[Dorothea von Velen]]—mistress of [[Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine]]—led to the abolition of [[Coverture|couverture]] in the [[Electoral Palatinate]] in 1707, making it an early beacon of women's rights. The Palatinate was the first German state to abolish couverture, but it was briefly re-instated by [[Charles III Philip, Elector Palatine|Karl III Philipp]], Johann Wilhelm's successor. Dorothea protested from exile in [[Amsterdam]]. She published her memoirs, ''A Life for Reform'', which were highly critical of Karl III Philipp's government. To avoid a scandal, Karl III Philipp yielded to Dorothea's demands, and couverture was once again abolished.&lt;ref&gt;Langdon-Davies, John (1962). Carlos: The Bewitched.

[[File:DDFC.jpg|150px|left|thumb|First page of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]]]
In 1791 the French playwright and political [[Activism|activist]] [[Olympe de Gouges]] published the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'',&lt;ref name=MS1112&gt;Macdonald and Scherf, "Introduction", pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; modelled on the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] of 1789. The Declaration is ironic in formulation and exposes the failure of the [[French Revolution]], which had been devoted to [[Egalitarianism|equality]]. It states that: “This revolution will only take effect when all women become fully aware of their deplorable condition, and of the rights they have lost in society”. The Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen follows the seventeen articles of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] point for point and has been described by Camille Naish as “almost a parody...of the original document”. The first article of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen proclaims that “Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be based only on common utility.” The first article of Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen replied: “Woman is born free and remains equal to man in rights. Social distinctions may only be based on common utility”. De Gouges expands the sixth article of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which declared the rights of citizens to take part in the formation of law, to:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“All citizens including women are equally admissible to all public dignities, offices and employments, according to their capacity, and with no other distinction than that of their virtues and talents”.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
De Gouges also draws attention to the fact that under French law women were fully punishable, yet denied equal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Death comes to the maiden: Sex and Execution, 1431–1933 |last=Naish |first=Camille |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |isbn= 978-0-415-05585-7 |page=137 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=OHYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Woman+and+the+Female+Citizen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1869 essay [[The Subjection of Women]] the English philosopher and political theorist [[John Stuart Mill]] described the situation for women in Britain as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We are continually told that civilization and Christianity have restored to the woman her just rights. Meanwhile the wife is the actual bondservant of her husband; no less so, as far as the legal obligation goes, than slaves commonly so called."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Then a member of parliament, Mill argued that women deserve the [[right to vote]], though his proposal to replace the term "man" with "person" in the second [[Reform Bill of&amp;nbsp;1867]] was greeted with laughter in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and defeated by 76&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;196 votes. His arguments won little support amongst contemporaries&lt;ref name="Brave new world – Women’s rights"/&gt; but his attempt to amend the reform bill generated greater attention for the issue of women's suffrage in Britain.&lt;ref name=suffrage/&gt; Initially only one of several women's rights campaigns, suffrage became the primary cause of the British women's movement at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The women’s suffrage movement in Britain, 1866–1928 |last=Van Wingerden |first=Sophia A. |year=1999 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn= 978-0-312-21853-9 |pages=1–2 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=0oLxK_NHI6kC&amp;printsec=frontcover }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the ability to vote was restricted to wealthy [[Property law|property owners]] within British jurisdictions. This arrangement implicitly excluded women as [[property law]] and [[marriage law]] gave men ownership rights at marriage or inheritance until the 19th&amp;nbsp;century. Although male suffrage broadened during the century, women were explicitly prohibited from voting nationally and locally in the 1830s by a [[1832 Reform Act|Reform Act]] and the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835|Municipal Corporations Act]].&lt;ref name=X&gt;Phillips, Melanie, The Ascent of Woman: A History of the Suffragette Movement (Abacus, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Millicent Fawcett]] and [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] led the public campaign on women's suffrage and in 1918 a bill was passed allowing women over the age of 30 to vote.&lt;ref name="X" /&gt;

== Equal employment rights for women and men ==
The rights of women and men to have equal pay and equal benefits for equal work were openly denied by the [[British Hong Kong]] Government up to the early 1970s. Leslie Wah-Leung Chung (鍾華亮, 1917–2009), President of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants' Association 香港政府華員會&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkccsa.org/ |title=香港政府華員會 |publisher=Hkccsa.org |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1965–68), contributed to the establishment of equal pay for men and women, including the right for married women to be permanent employees. Before this, the job status of a woman changed from permanent employee to temporary employee once she was married, thus losing the pension benefit. Some of them even lost their jobs. Since nurses were mostly women, this improvement of the rights of married women meant much to the Nursing profession.&lt;ref name="RebeccaChan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="facebook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="torontosun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.torontosun.com/2012/04/06/celebrating-two-lives-well-lived|title=Celebrating two lives well lived &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Toronto Sun|publisher=m.torontosun.com|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ottawasun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ottawasun.com/videos/celebrating-two-lives-well-lived/1550780688001|title=Celebrating two lives well lived : Featured OTT : Videos|publisher=ottawasun.com|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Connor |first=Kevin |url=http://www.torontosun.com/2012/04/07/life-love-and-service-recalled |title=Life, love and service &amp;#124; Toronto &amp; GTA &amp;#124; News |publisher=Toronto Sun |date=7 April 2012 |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.singtao.ca/toronto/2012-04-08/city1333873203d3799095.html |title=曾參與二戰及香港保衛戰華裔夫婦.加美軍方墓前致最高敬意_星島日報_加拿大多倫多中文新聞網。 Canada Toronto Chinese newspaper |publisher=News.singtao.ca |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epapertor.worldjournal.com/showtor.html?apJi+mgEEOB3Bg1Fmi3TsQ==,MMV3f+xDb0CKYCyOu+WesQ== |title=世界日報電子報 - World Journal ePaper |publisher=Epapertor.worldjournal.com |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mingpaotor.com/htm/News/20120408/tfc1.htm |title=明報新聞網海外版 - 加東版(多倫多) - Canada Toronto Chinese Newspaper - 社區新聞 |publisher=Mingpaotor.com |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alice paul.jpg|thumb|left|Strategist and activist [[Alice Paul]] guided and ran much of the Suffrage movement in the U.S. in the 1910s.]]
During the 19th century some women began to ask for, demand, and then agitate and demonstrate for the [[right to vote]] - the right to participate in their government and its law making.&lt;ref name=Krolokke&gt;Krolokke, Charlotte and Anne Scott Sorensen, 'From Suffragettes to Grrls' in Gender Communication Theories and Analyses:From Silence to Performance (Sage, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Other women opposed suffrage, like [[Helen Kendrick Johnson]], whose prescient 1897 work, ''Woman and the Republic'', contains perhaps the best arguments against women's suffrage of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Helen Kendrick. Woman and the Republic. 1897.&lt;/ref&gt; The ideals of [[women's suffrage]] developed alongside that of [[universal suffrage]] and today women's suffrage is considered a right (under the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]]). During the 19th century the right to vote was gradually extended in many countries, and women started to campaign for their right to vote. In 1893 New Zealand became the first country to give women the right to vote on a national level. Australia gave women the right to vote in 1902.&lt;ref name=suffrage&gt;{{cite web |title=Women's Suffrage |url=http://content.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=5193 |publisher=Scholastic |accessdate=20 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[Nordic countries]] gave women the right to vote in the early 20th century&amp;nbsp;– Finland (1906), Norway (1913), Denmark and Iceland (1915). With the end of the First World War many other countries followed&amp;nbsp;– the [[Netherlands]] (1917), [[Austria]], [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Azerbaijan]],&lt;ref&gt;Tadeusz Swietochowski.

In [[India]], under colonial rule, universal suffrage was granted in 1935.

== Property rights ==
During the 19th century some women in the United States and Britain began to challenge laws that denied them the [[Women's Property Rights|right to their property]] once they married. Under the common law doctrine of ''[[coverture]]'' husbands gained control of their wives' real estate and wages. Beginning in the 1840s, state legislatures in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/marriedwomensproperty/a/property_1848ny.htm |title=Married Women's Property Act &amp;#124; 1848 &amp;#124; New York State |publisher=Womenshistory.about.com |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the British Parliament&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umd.umich.edu/casl/hum/eng/classes/434/geweb/PROPERTY.htm |title=Property Rights Of Women |publisher=Umd.umich.edu |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; began passing statutes that protected women's property from their husbands and their husbands' creditors. These laws were known as the Married Women's Property Acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/366305/Married-Womens-Property-Acts |title=Married Women's Property Acts (United States [1839&amp;#93;)&amp;nbsp;– Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courts in the 19th-century United States also continued to require privy examinations of married women who sold their property. A [[privy examination]] was a practice in which a married woman who wished to sell her property had to be separately examined by a judge or justice of the peace outside of the presence of her husband and asked if her husband was pressuring her into signing the document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_womens_history/v012/12.2braukman.html |title=Project MUSE&amp;nbsp;– Journal of Women's History&amp;nbsp;– Married Women's Property and Male Coercion: United States Courts and the Privy Examination, 1864–1887 |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the subsequent decades women's rights again became an important issue in the English speaking world. By the 1960s the movement was called "feminism" or "women's liberation." Reformers wanted the same pay as men, equal rights in law, and the freedom to plan their families or not have children at all. Their efforts were met with mixed results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jofreeman.com/feminism/suffrage.htm |title=Waves of Feminism |publisher=Jofreeman.com |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Council of Women]] (ICW) was the first women's organization to work across national boundaries for the common cause of advocating human rights for women. In March and April 1888, women leaders came together in Washington D.C. with 80 speakers and 49 delegates representing 53 women's organizations from 9 countries: Canada, the United States, Ireland, India, England, Finland, Denmark, France and Norway. Women from professional organizations, trade unions, arts groups and benevolent societies participate. National Councils are affiliated to the ICW and thus make themselves heard at international level. The ICW worked with the [[League of Nations]] during the 1920s and the [[United Nations]] post-World War II. Today the ICW holds Consultative Status with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]], the highest accreditation an NGO can achieve at the United Nations. Currently, it is composed of 70 countries and has a headquarters in Lasaunne, Switzerland. International meetings are held every three years.

In the UK, a public groundswell of opinion in favour of legal equality had gained pace, partly through the extensive employment of women in what were traditional male roles during both world wars. By the 1960s the legislative process was being readied, tracing through MP [[Willie Hamilton]]'s [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]] report, his equal pay for equal work bill,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/620037.stm |work=BBC News | title=Tributes paid to veteran anti-royalist | date=27 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; the creation of a Sex Discrimination Board, [[Lady Sear]]'s draft sex anti-discrimination bill, a government [[Green Paper]] of 1973, until 1975 when the first British Sex Discrimination Act, an Equal Pay Act, and an [[Equal Opportunities Commission]] came into force.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, 29 December 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 29 December 1975 "Sex discrimination in advertising banned".&lt;/ref&gt; With encouragement from the UK government, the other countries of the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] soon followed suit with an agreement to ensure that discrimination laws would be phased out across the European Community.

In the USA, the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) was created in 1966 with the purpose of bringing about equality for all women. NOW was one important group that fought for the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA). This amendment stated that "equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of [[gender|sex]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.now.org/history/purpos66.html |title=The National Organization for Women's 1966 Statement of Purpose |publisher=Now.org |date=29 October 1966 |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; But there was disagreement on how the proposed amendment would be understood. Supporters believed it would guarantee women equal treatment. But critics feared it might deny women the right be financially supported by their husbands. The amendment died in 1982 because not enough states had ratified it. ERAs have been included in subsequent Congresses, but have still failed to be ratified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/national-organization-for-women?cat=biz-fin&amp;nr=1 |title=National Organization for Women: Definition and Much More from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Women for Women International]] (WfWI) is a nonprofit humanitarian organization that provides practical and moral support to women survivors of war. WfWI helps such women rebuild their lives after war’s devastation through a year-long tiered program that begins with direct financial aid and emotional counseling and includes life skills (e.g., literacy, numeracy) training if necessary, rights awareness education, health education, job skills training and small business development. The organization was co-founded in 1993 by [[Zainab Salbi]], an [[Iraqi American]] who is herself a survivor of the [[Iran–Iraq War]] and Salbi’s then-husband Amjad Atallah. Since June 2012, WfWI has been led by Afshan Khan, a long-time former executive with UNICEF who became WfWI’s first new CEO since founder Zainab Salbi stepped down to devote more time to her writing and lecturing.&lt;ref&gt;"Women for Women International Names Afshan Khan New CEO."

The [[Association for the Protection and Defense of Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia]] is a [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] [[Non-governmental organization]] founded to provide activism for [[Women's rights in Saudi Arabia|women's rights]]. It was founded by [[Wajeha al-Huwaider]] and Fawzia Al-Uyyouni, and grew out of a 2007 movement to gain women the right to drive.

== Natural law ==
17th century [[natural law]] philosophers in Britain and America, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[John Locke]], developed the theory of [[natural rights]] in reference to ancient philosophers such as [[Aristotle]] and the Christian theologist [[Aquinas]]. Like the ancient philosophers, 17th century natural law philosophers defended [[slavery]] and an inferior status of women in law.&lt;ref name="Morey 2010 282"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Morey| first = Dr Robert A.| title = The Bible, Natural theology and Natural Law: Conflict Or Compromise?| publisher = Xulon Press| year = 2010| page = 282 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=Ct2P-AUUMe0C&amp;dq=Dr+Robert+a.+Morey| isbn = 978-1-60957-143-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relying on ancient Greek philosophers, natural law philosophers argued that [[natural rights]] were not derived from god, but were "universal, self-evident, and intuitive", a law that could be found in nature. They believed that natural rights were self-evident to "civilised man" who lives "in the highest form of society".&lt;ref name="Morey 2010 297"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Morey| first = Dr Robert A.| title = The Bible, Natural theology and Natural Law: Conflict Or Compromise?| publisher = Xulon Press| year = 2010| page = 297 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=Ct2P-AUUMe0C&amp;dq=Dr+Robert+a.+Morey| isbn = 978-1-60957-143-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural rights derived from [[human nature]], a concept first established by the ancient Greek philosopher [[Zeno of Citium]] in ''Concerning Human Nature''. Zenon argued that each rational and civilized male Greek citizen had a "divine spark" or "soul" within him that existed independent of the body. Zeno founded the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophy]] and the idea of a human nature was adopted by other Greek philosophers, and later [[natural law]] philosophers and western [[humanists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Morey| first = Dr Robert A.| title = The Bible, Natural theology and Natural Law: Conflict Or Compromise?| publisher = Xulon Press| year = 2010| page = 214 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=Ct2P-AUUMe0C&amp;dq=Dr+Robert+a.+Morey| isbn = 978-1-60957-143-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle developed the widely adopted idea of [[rationality]], arguing that man was a "rational animal" and as such a natural power of reason.

{{main|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women}}

The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted in 1948, enshrines "the equal rights of men and women", and addressed both the equality and equity issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1979, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) for legal implementation of the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]]. Described as an international [[bill of rights]] for [[woman|women]], it came into force on 3 September 1981. The UN member states that have not ratified the convention are Iran, Nauru, Palau, Somalia, Sudan, Tonga, and the United States. [[Niue]] and the Vatican City, which are non-member states, have also not ratified it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/protocol/CEDAW%20Ratification%20Table%20IV-8.en.pdf |title=Microsoft Word&amp;nbsp;— IV-8.en.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention defines discrimination against women in the following terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It also establishes an agenda of action for putting an end to sex-based discrimination for which states ratifying the Convention are required to enshrine [[gender equality]] into their domestic legislation, repeal all discriminatory provisions in their laws, and enact new provisions to guard against discrimination against women. They must also establish tribunals and public institutions to guarantee women effective protection against discrimination, and take steps to eliminate all forms of discrimination practiced against women by individuals, organizations, and enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]], Article 2 (e).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 ===
{{main|United Nations Security Council Resolution}}
On 31 October 2000, the [[United Nations Security Council]] unanimously adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325]], the first formal and legal document from the United Nations Security Council that requires all states respect fully [[international humanitarian law]] and [[international human rights law]] appicable to the rights and protection of women and girls during and after the armed conflicts.

{{main|Rape|War rape}}
Rape, sometimes called [[sexual assault]], is an assault by a person involving [[sexual intercourse]] with or [[sexual penetration]] of another person without that person's [[consent]]. Rape is generally considered a serious [[sex crime]] as well as a civil assault. When part of a widespread and systematic practice, rape and [[sexual slavery]] are now recognised as a [[crime against humanity]] as well as a [[war crime]]. Rape is also now recognised as a form of [[genocide]] when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted group.

=== Rape as an element of the crime of genocide ===
{{main|Rwandan genocide}}
In 1998, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] established by the United Nations made landmark decisions that rape is a crime of [[genocide]] under [[international law]]. The trial of [[Jean-Paul Akayesu]], the mayor of Taba Commune in Rwanda, established precedents that rape is an element of the crime of genocide. The Akayesu judgement includes the first interpretation and application by an international court of the 1948 [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]]. The Trial Chamber held that rape, which it defined as "a physical invasion of a sexual nature committed on a person under circumstances which are coercive", and sexual assault constitute acts of genocide insofar as they were committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted group. It found that sexual assault formed an integral part of the process of destroying the [[Tutsi]] ethnic group and that the rape was systematic and had been perpetrated against Tutsi women only, manifesting the specific intent required for those acts to constitute genocide.&lt;ref name=unreport&gt;Fourth Annual Report of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] to the General Assembly (September, 1999), accessed at [http://www.unictr.org/Portals/0/English%5CAnnualReports%5Ca-54-315.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge [[Navanethem Pillay]] said in a statement after the verdict: “From time immemorial, rape has been regarded as one of the [[spoils of war]]. Now it will be considered a war crime. We want to send out a strong message that rape is no longer a trophy of war.”&lt;ref name=paulwalters&gt;[[Navanethem Pillay]] is quoted by Professor Paul Walters in his presentation of her honorary [[doctorate of law]], [[Rhodes University]], April 2005 [http://www.ru.ac.za/academic/graduation/addresses_and_citations/2005/Judge_Pillay_citation.doc]&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 500,000 women were raped during the 1994 Rwandan Genocide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnesty.org.nz/web/pages/home.nsf/0/e57ea3f05f6aa848cc256e460012f365?OpenDocument Violence Against Women: Worldwide Statistics]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rape and sexual enslavement as crime against humanity ===
{{main|Crimes against humanity}}
The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]] Explanatory Memorandum, which defines the jurisdiction of the [[International Criminal Court]], recognises rape, [[sexual slavery]], [[enforced prostitution]], [[forced pregnancy]], [[compulsory sterilization|enforced sterilization]], "or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity" as a [[Crimes against humanity|crime against humanity]] if the action is part of a widespread or systematic practice.&lt;ref name="Horton"&gt;As quoted by Guy Horton in ''[http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs3/Horton-2005.pdf Dying Alive&amp;nbsp;– A Legal Assessment of Human Rights Violations in Burma]'' April 2005, co-Funded by The Netherlands Ministry for Development Co-Operation. See section "12.52 Crimes against humanity", Page 201. He references RSICC/C, Vol. 1 p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/romefra.htm |title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] also condemn systematic rape as well as murder, [[sexual slavery]], and forced pregnancy, as the "violations of the fundamental principles of international human rights and humanitarian law." and require a particularly effective response.&lt;ref&gt;Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, Section II, paragraph 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape was first recognised as a [[crime against humanity]] when the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] issued arrest warrants based on the [[Geneva Conventions]] and Violations of the Laws or Customs of War. Specifically, it was recognised that Muslim women in [[Foča|Foca]] (southeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina) were subjected to systematic and widespread [[gang rape]], torture, and [[sexual enslavement]] by [[Bosnian Serb]] soldiers, policemen, and members of paramilitary groups after the takeover of the city in April 1992.&lt;ref name="haverford"&gt;[http://www.haverford.edu/relg/sells/rape.html Rape as a Crime Against Humanity]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indictment was of major legal significance and was the first time that sexual assaults were investigated for the purpose of prosecution under the rubric of [[torture]] and [[enslavement]] as a crime against humanity.&lt;ref name="haverford"/&gt; The indictment was confirmed by a 2001 verdict by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] that rape and [[sexual enslavement]] are [[crimes against humanity]]. This ruling challenged the widespread acceptance of rape and sexual enslavement of women as intrinsic part of war.&lt;ref name=AmnestyInt2001feb22&gt;[http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR630042001?open&amp;of=ENG-BIH Bosnia and Herzegovina : Foca verdict&amp;nbsp;– rape and sexual enslavement are crimes against humanity]. 22 February 2001. [[Amnesty International]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] found three Bosnian Serb men guilty of rape of [[Bosniac]] (Bosnian Muslim) women and girls (some as young as 12 and 15 years of age), in [[Foča|Foca]], eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina. Furthermore two of the men were found guilty of the crime against humanity of [[sexual enslavement]] for holding women and girls captive in a number of de facto detention centres. Many of the women subsequently disappeared.&lt;ref name=AmnestyInt2001feb22/&gt;
