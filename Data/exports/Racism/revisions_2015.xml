'''Racism''' consists of ideologies and practices that seek to justify, or cause, the unequal distribution of privileges or rights among different [[race (human classification)|racial groups]]. Modern variants are often based in social perceptions of biological differences between peoples. These can take the form of social actions, practices or beliefs, or political systems that consider different races to be ranked as inherently [[Supremacism|superior]] or inferior to each other, based on presumed shared inheritable traits, abilities, or qualities. It may also hold that members of different races should be treated differently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/racism Racism] Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schaefer"&gt;"Racism" in R.

Among the questions of how to define racism, is whether to include forms of discrimination that are unintentional, such as making assumptions about preferences or abilities of others based on [[racial stereotype]]s, whether to include [[symbolic racism|symbolic]] or [[Institutional racism|institutionalized forms of discrimination]] such as the circulation of [[ethnic stereotype]]s through the media, or whether to include the sociopolitical dynamics of [[social stratification]] that sometimes have a racial component.

While race and [[ethnicity]] are considered to be separate phenomena in contemporary social science, the two terms have a long history of equivalence in popular usage and older social science literature. 
''Racism'' and ''racial discrimination'' are often used to describe discrimination on an ethnic or cultural basis, independent of whether these differences are described as racial. According to the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|convention]], there is no distinction between the terms ''racial discrimination'' and ''[[Ethnic group|ethnic]] discrimination,'' superiority based on racial differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous, and there is no justification for racial discrimination, in theory or in practice, anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CERD.aspx|title=International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=December 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Middletown, Conn: Wesleyan University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also a major force behind [[racial segregation]], especially in the [[United States]] in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and [[South Africa]] under [[apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]]; 19th and 20th century racism in [[Western world|Western culture]] is particularly well documented and constitutes a reference point in studies and discourses about racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Racism : a global reader | first1 = Kevin | last1 = Reilly | first2 = Stephen | last2 = Kaufman | first3 = Angela | last3 = Bodino | year = 2003 | publisher = M.E.

[[Indigenous peoples]] have been –and are– often subject to racist attitudes. Practices and ideologies of racism are condemned by the [[United Nations]] in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly, ''Universal Declaration of Human Rights'', 10 December 1948, 217 A (III), available at: [http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/] [accessed 18 July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
{{Race}}
[[File:ProceedingsLakeMohonkConference.png|thumb|1902 use of the word "racism".]]
In the 19th century, some scientists subscribed to the belief that the human population is divided into races,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0006636 | title = Racism | accessdate = 2010-07-23 | last = Frideres | first = J.S. | date = May 2010 | work = The Canadian Encyclopedia | publisher = Canadian Encyclopedia | quote = Racism was developed and popularized by scientists in the 19th century, as they were regarded as purveyors of truth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that some races were inferior to others, and that differential treatment of races was consequently justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/combating_discrimination/l33178_en.htm|work=Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA of 28 November 2008|publisher=European Union|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cerd.htm|work=UN Treaty Series|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=3 February 2011| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/61DocT4xh | archivedate = 2011-08-26| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such theories are generally termed [[scientific racism]].

Today, most biologists, anthropologists, and sociologists reject a taxonomy of races in favor of more specific and/or empirically verifiable criteria, such as geography, [[ethnic group|ethnicity]], or a history of [[endogamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Does Race Exist? | journal = Scientific American | date = December 2003 | first = Michael | last = Bamshad | author2 = Steve E. Olson| quote = If races are defined as genetically discrete groups, no. But researchers can use some genetic information to group individuals into clusters with medical relevance.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The updated entry in the Oxford English Dictionary (2008) defines racialism simply as "An earlier term than racism, but now largely superseded by it," and cites it in a 1902 quote.&lt;ref&gt;"racialism, n.". [http://www.oed.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/view/Entry/157084 OED Online]. September 2013. Oxford University Press. (Accessed December 03, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; The revised Oxford English Dictionary cites the shortened term "racism" in a quote from the following year, 1903.&lt;ref&gt;"racism, n.". [http://www.oed.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/view/Entry/157097 OED Online]. September 2013. Oxford University Press.

Additionally, the OED records ''racism'' as a [[synonym]] of ''racialism'': "belief in the superiority of a particular race". By the end of [[World War II]], ''racism'' had acquired the same supremacist connotations formerly associated with ''racialism'': ''racism'' now implied racial discrimination, racial [[supremacism]] and a harmful intent. (The term "race hatred" had also been used by [[sociologist]] [[Frederick Hertz]] in the late 1920s.)

== Definitions ==
As its etymology indicates, the first use of the word ''racism'' is relatively recent—i.e., the 1900s, most literally the 1930s. Linguistically, as the word is a general abstraction that does not in and of itself connote a great deal of positive or negative meaning without additional context (i.e., "racism" = noun of action/condition regarding "race"), its definition and semantics are not entirely settled. Nonetheless, the term is commonly used, often negatively as a pejorative (e.g., "racist"), and is associated with race-based [[prejudice]], [[violence]], [[dislike]], [[discrimination]], or [[oppression]].

=== Legal ===
The UN does not define "racism"; however, it does define "racial discrimination": According to the [[United Nations]] [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;the term "racial discrimination" shall mean any distinction, exclusion, restriction, or preference based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], colour, [[Cultural heritage|descent]], or national or [[ethnicity|ethnic]] origin that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of [[human rights]] and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hri.org/docs/ICERD66.html UN International Convention on the Elimination of All of Racial Discrimination], New York 7 March 1966&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This definition does not make any difference between discrimination based on [[ethnicity]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], in part because the distinction between the two remains debatable among [[Anthropology|anthropologists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Metraux | first1 = A. | year = 1950 | title = United nations Economic and Security Council Statement by Experts on Problems of Race | url = | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 53 | issue = 1| pages = 142–145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in British law the phrase ''racial group'' means "any group of people who are defined by reference to their race, colour, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/prosecution/rrpbcrbook.html |title=Racist and Religious Crime – CPS Prosecution Policy |publisher=The CPS |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norway, the word "race" has been removed from national laws concerning discrimination as the use of the phrase is considered problematic and unethical.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Dagsland Holgersen (23 July 2010) [http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article3743067.ece Rasebegrepet på vei ut av loven] ''[[Aftenposten]]''.

=== Sociological ===
{{Main|Sociology of race and ethnic relations}}

Some [[Sociology|sociologists]] have defined racism as a system of categorical [[privilege (social inequality)|privilege]]. In ''Portraits of White Racism'', David Wellman defined racism as "culturally sanctioned beliefs, which, regardless of intentions involved, defend the advantages whites have because of the subordinated position of racial minorities".&lt;ref name="Wellman"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wellman | first = David T. | title = Portraits of White Racism | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1993 | location = New York, NY | pages = x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists Noël A. Cazenave and Darlene Alvarez Maddern define racism as "...&amp;nbsp;a highly organized system of 'race'-based group privilege that operates at every level of society and is held together by a sophisticated ideology of color/'race' supremacy. Sellers and Shelton (2003) found that a relationship between racial discrimination and emotional distress was moderated by racial ideology and public regard beliefs. That is, racial centrality appears to promote the degree of discrimination African American young adults perceive whereas racial ideology may buffer the detrimental emotional effects of that discrimination. Racist systems include, but cannot be reduced to, racial bigotry,".&lt;ref name="Cazenave"&gt;{{cite book | last = Cazenave | first = Noël A. | author2 = Darlene Alvarez | title="Defending the White Race:White Male Faculty Opposition to a White Racism Course" Race and Society 2 | year = 1999 | pages = 25–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sociologists have also argued that, in some instances, racism has changed from blatant to more covert expression. The "newer" (more hidden and less easily detectable) forms of racism—which can be considered as embedded in social processes and structures—are more difficult to explore as well as challenge. It has been suggested that, while in many countries overt and explicit racism has become increasingly taboo, even in those who display egalitarian explicit attitudes, an implicit or [[aversive racism]] is still maintained subconsciously.

=== Segregationism ===
{{Main|Racial segregation}}
Racial segregation is the separation of humans into [[Race (human categorization)|socially-constructed racial groups]] in daily life. It may apply to activities such as eating in a restaurant, drinking from a water fountain, using a bath room, attending school, going to the movies, or in the rental or purchase of a home.&lt;ref&gt;''Principles to Guide Housing Policy at the Beginning of the Millennium'', Michael Schill &amp; Susan Wachter, [[Cityscape]]&lt;/ref&gt; Segregation is generally outlawed, but may exist through social norms, even when there is no strong individual preference for it, as suggested by [[Thomas Schelling]]'s models of segregation and subsequent work.

=== Racial discrimination ===
Racial discrimination refers to the separation of people through a process of social division into categories not necessarily related to races for purposes of differential treatment. [[Racial segregation]] policies may formalize it, but it is also often exerted without being legalized. Researchers [[Marianne Bertrand]] and [[Sendhil Mullainathan]], at the [[University of Chicago]] and [[MIT]] found in a 2004 study that there was widespread discrimination in the workplace against job applicants whose names were merely perceived as "sounding black". These applicants were 50% less likely than candidates perceived as having "white-sounding names" to receive callbacks for interviews. [[Devah Pager]], a sociologist at [[Princeton University]], sent matched pairs of applicants to apply for jobs in Milwaukee and New York City, finding that black applicants received callbacks or job offers at half the rate of equally qualified whites.&lt;ref&gt;"Discrimination in a Low Wage Labor Market: A Field Experiment," 2009, ''American Sociological Review'', by Devah Pager, Bruce Western, and Bart Bonikowski&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Mark of a Criminal Record," 2003, ''American Journal of Sociology'', by Devah Pager&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, institutions and courts have upheld discrimination against whites when it is done to promote a diverse work or educational environment, even when it was shown to be to the detriment of qualified applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-04-22-scotus-firefighters_N.htm?loc=interstitialskip |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |title=Court tackles racial bias in work promotions |first=Joan |last=Biskupic |authorlink=Joan Biskupic |date=April 22, 2009 |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.udayton.edu/race/04needs/education03.htm |title=The Struggle for Access in Law School Admissions |publisher=Academic.udayton.edu |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers view these results as strong evidence of unconscious biases rooted in [[Discrimination in the United States|the United States' long history of discrimination]] (e.g., [[Jim Crow laws]], etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1257/0002828042002561| title = Are Emily and Greg More Employable Than Lakisha and Jamal?

[[Institutional racism]] (also known as structural racism, [[state racism]] or systemic racism) is racial discrimination by governments, corporations, religions, or educational institutions or other large organizations with the power to influence the lives of many individuals. [[Stokely Carmichael]] is credited for coining the phrase ''institutional racism'' in the late 1960s. He defined the term as "the collective failure of an organization to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin".&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Race, {{PDFlink|Critics have replied that Carmichael's definition glosses over individual responsibility and leaves no room to question whether the members of a group are failing or not meeting standards due not to discrimination but due to their own dysfunctional behaviour and bad choices.

[[Maulana Karenga]] argued that racism constituted the destruction of culture, language, religion, and human possibility and that the effects of racism were "the morally monstrous destruction of human possibility involved redefining African humanity to the world, poisoning past, present and future relations with others who only know us through this stereotyping and thus damaging the truly human relations among peoples".{{cn|date=September 2015}}

Historical economic or social disparity is alleged to be a form of [[discrimination]] caused by past racism and historical reasons, affecting the present generation through deficits in the formal education and kinds of preparation in previous generations, and through primarily unconscious racist attitudes and actions on members of the general population.

=== Symbolic/modern ===
{{Main|Symbolic racism}}
Some scholars argue that in the US earlier violent and aggressive forms of racism have evolved into a more subtle form of prejudice in the late 20th century. This new form of racism is sometimes referred to as "modern racism" and characterized by outwardly acting unprejudiced while inwardly maintaining prejudiced attitudes, displaying subtle prejudiced behaviors such as actions informed by attributing qualities to others based on racial stereotypes, and evaluating the same behavior differently based on the race of the person being evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, E., Wilson, T. D., &amp; Akert, R. M. (2010). Social Psychology (7th edition). New York: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt; This view is based on studies of prejudice and discriminatory behavior, where some people will act ambivalently towards black people, with positive reactions in certain, more public contexts, but more negative views and expressions in more private contexts. This ambivalence may also be visible for example in hiring decisions where job candidates that are otherwise positively evaluated may be unconsciously disfavored by employers in the final decision because of their race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McConahay | first1 = J.

B. (1986). Modern racism, ambivalence, and the modern racism scale.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars consider modern racism to be characterized by an explicit rejection of stereotypes, combined with resistance to changing structures of discrimination for reasons that are ostensibly non-racial, an ideology that considers opportunity at a purely individual basis denying the relevance of race in determining individual opportunities and the exhibition of indirect forms of micro-aggression toward and/or avoidance of people of other races.&lt;ref&gt;Pettigrew, T.

=== Cultural ===
Cultural racism is a term used to describe and explain new racial ideologies and practices that have emerged since World War II. It can be defined as societal beliefs and customs that promote the assumption that the products of a given culture, including the language and traditions of that culture are superior to those of other cultures. It shares a great deal with [[xenophobia]], which is often characterised by fear of, or aggression toward, members of an [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]] by members of an [[Ingroups and outgroups|ingroup]].

Cultural racism exists when there is a widespread acceptance of stereotypes concerning different ethnic or population groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14649360120047788#.VDMHQRYYnWc|title=Cultural racism: Something rotten in the state of Denmark?|journal=Social &amp; Cultural Geography|doi=10.1080/14649360120047788|author=Karen Wren|volume=2|issue=2|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where racism can be characterised by the belief that one race is inherently superior to another, cultural racism can be characterised by the belief that one culture is inherently superior to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~lnp3/mydocs/Blaut/racism.htm|title=The Theory of Cultural Racism|journal=Antipode: A Radical Journal of Geography|volume=23|year=1992|page=289-99|author=James M.

===Color blindness===
{{main|Color blindness (race) in the United States}}
Color blindness is held to be the disregard of racial characteristics in [[social interaction]]. [[Eduardo Bonilla-Silva]] argues that color blind racism arises from an "abstract [[liberalism]], biologization of culture, naturalization of racial matters, and minimization of racism".&lt;ref name ="Bonilla-Silva"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bonilla-Silva | first = Eduardo | title= White Supremacy and Racism in the Post-Civil Rights Era | publisher = Lynne Rienner Publishers, Inc| year = 2001 | pages = 137–166 | isbn = 978-1-58826-032-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Color blind practices are "subtle, [[institution]]al, and apparently nonracial"&lt;ref name=Bonilla-Silva1&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonilla-Silva|first=Eduardo|title=Racism without Racists: Color-blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in the United States|year=2003|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield| location=Lanham| isbn=978-0-7425-1633-5| pages=2–29| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6IG7QgAACAAJ&amp;dq=racism+without+racists&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HGGpTpeZNqbKsQKrrIGxDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; because race is explicitly ignored in decision making. If race is disregarded in predominately white populations, for example, whiteness becomes the [[norm (social)|normative]] standard, whereas [[people of color]] are [[other]]ed, and the racism these individuals experience may be minimized or erased.&lt;ref name ="Parker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Race Is-- Race Isn't: Critical Race Theory and Qualitative Studies in Education |last=Parker |first=Laurence |authorlink= |year=1999 |publisher=Westview Press |location= |isbn=0-8133-9069-9 |pages=184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Social"&gt;{{cite book | title=Our Social World: Introduction to Sociology (Condensed Version) | publisher=SAGE | year=2015 | location=Los Angeles | isbn=9781452275758 | first1=Jeanne H. | last1=Ballantine | first2=Keith A. | last2=Roberts | edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an individual level, people with "color blind prejudice" reject racist ideology, but also reject systemic policies intended to fix [[institutional racism]].&lt;ref name="Social" /&gt;

===Othering===
{{main|Other}}
Othering is the term used by some to describe a system of discrimination whereby the characteristics of a group are used to distinguish them as separate from the norm.&lt;ref&gt;Mountz, Alison. (2009) Key Concepts in Political Geography. SAGE. pp. 328&lt;/ref&gt;

Othering plays a fundamental role in the history and continuation of racism. By objectifying a culture as something different, exotic or underdeveloped is to generalize that it is not like 'normal' society. Europe's colonial attitude towards the Orient exemplifies this as it was thought that the East was the opposite of the West; feminine where the West was masculine, weak where the West was strong and traditional where the West was progressive.&lt;ref name="Said, Edward 1978 pp.357"&gt;Said, Edward. (1978) Orientalism. New York: Pantheon Books. pp.357&lt;/ref&gt; By making these generalizations and othering the East, Europe was simultaneously defining herself as the norm, further entrenching the gap.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Derek. (2004). The Colonial Present. Blackwell publishers. pp.4&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the process of othering relies on imagined difference, or the expectation of difference. Spatial difference can be enough to conclude that "we" are "here" and the "others" are over "there".&lt;ref name="Said, Edward 1978 pp.357"/&gt; Imagined differences serve to categorize people into groups and assign them characteristics that suit the imaginer's expectations.&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward. (1978) Orientalism. New York: Pantheon Books. pp.360&lt;/ref&gt;

== Declarations and international law against racial discrimination ==
In 1919, a [[Racial Equality Proposal, 1919|proposal]] to include a racial equality provision in the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]] was supported by a majority, but not adopted in the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]]. In 1943, Japan and its allies declared work for the abolition of racial discrimination to be their aim at the [[Greater East Asia Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=C. Peter Chen |url=http://ww2db.com/battle_spec.php?battle_id=70%20WW2DB:%20Greater%20East%20Asia%20Conference |title=Joint Declaration of the Greater East Asia Conference (below) |publisher=Ww2db.com |date=1945-02-23 |accessdate=2011-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 1 of the 1945 [[UN Charter]] includes "promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race" as UN purpose.

In 1950, [[UNESCO]] suggested in ''[[The Race Question]]'' —a statement signed by 21 scholars such as [[Ashley Montagu]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Gunnar Myrdal]], [[Julian Huxley]], etc. — to "drop the term ''race'' altogether and instead speak of [[ethnic groups]]". The statement condemned [[scientific racism]] theories that had played a role in [[the Holocaust]]. It aimed both at debunking scientific racist theories, by popularizing modern knowledge concerning "the race question," and morally condemned racism as contrary to the philosophy of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and its assumption of [[Social equality|equal rights]] for all. Along with Myrdal's ''[[An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy]]'' (1944), ''The Race Question'' influenced the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court [[racial segregation in the United States|desegregation]] decision in "[[Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka]]".&lt;ref name="Prins"&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=30431&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html "Toward a World without Evil: Alfred Métraux as UNESCO Anthropologist (1946–1962)"], by [[Harald E.L.

The United Nations use the definition of racial discrimination laid out in the ''[[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]]'', adopted in 1966:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''...&amp;nbsp;any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, color, descent, or national or ethnic origin that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.''(Part 1 of Article 1 of the U.N. International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/cerd.htm Text of the Convention], ''[[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]]'', 1966 {{Wayback|url=http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/cerd.htm|date =20110726053246}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2001, the [[European Union]] explicitly banned racism, along with many other forms of social discrimination, in the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]], the legal effect of which, if any, would necessarily be limited to [[Institutions of the European Union]]: "Article 21 of the charter prohibits discrimination on any ground such as race, color, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, disability, age or sexual orientation and also discrimination on the grounds of nationality."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lbr.nl/internationaal/charter%20uk.html] {{Wayback|url=http://www.lbr.nl/internationaal/charter%20uk.html|date =20110724160333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racism existed during the 19th century as "[[scientific racism]]", which attempted to provide a [[typology (anthropology)|racial classification]] of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre-André Taguieff]], ''La force du préjugé'', 1987 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Blumenbach]] in 1775, advocating [[polygenism]], divided the world's population into five groups according to skin color (Caucasians, Mongols, etc.). The archetypical form of racism is, perhaps, found with the polygenist [[Christoph Meiners]]. He split mankind into two divisions which he labeled the "beautiful White race" and the "ugly Black race". In Meiners's book, ''The Outline of History of Mankind,'' Meiners claimed that a main characteristic of race is either beauty or ugliness. He viewed only the white race as beautiful. He considered ugly races as inferior, immoral and animal-like.

[[Anders Retzius]] demonstrated that neither Europeans nor others are one "pure race", but of mixed origins. While [[Typology (anthropology)#Typology|discredited]], derivations of Blumenbach's taxonomy are [[Definitions of whiteness in the United States|still widely used]] for classification of the population in [[USA]]. [[::dk::Hans Petter Steensby|H. P. Steensby]], while strongly emphasizing that all humans today are of mixed origins, in 1907 claimed that the origins of human differences must be traced extraordinarily far back in time, and conjectured that the "purest race" today would be the [[Australian Aboriginals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://img.kb.dk/tidsskriftdk/pdf/gto/gto_0019-PDF/gto_0019_67206.pdf |title=Race Studies in Denmark |journal=Geografisk Tidsskrift |publisher=[[Norwegian Geographical Society]] |volume=19 |language=Danish |year=1907 |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific racism fell strongly out of favor in the early 20th Century, but the origins of fundamental human and societal differences are still researched within [[academia]], in fields such as [[human genetics]] including [[paleogenetics]], [[social anthropology]], [[comparative politics]], [[history of religions]], [[history of ideas]], [[prehistory]], [[history]], [[ethics]], and [[psychiatry]]. There is widespread rejection of any methodology based on anything similar to Blumenbach's races. It is more unclear to which extent and when [[ethnic stereotype|ethnic]] and [[nation]]al [[archetype|stereotypes]] are accepted.

Although after [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]], racist ideologies were discredited on ethical, political and scientific grounds, but racism and racial discrimination have remained widespread around the world.

[[W.E.B. Du Bois|Du Bois]] observed that it is not so much "race" that we think about, but culture: "...&amp;nbsp;a common history, common laws and religion, similar habits of thought and a conscious striving together for certain ideals of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=1119 |title=The Conservation of Races |last=DuBois|first=W. E. B. |year=1897 |page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Late 19th century nationalists were the first to embrace contemporary discourses on "race", ethnicity, and "[[survival of the fittest]]" to shape new nationalist doctrines. Ultimately, race came to represent not only the most important traits of the human body, but was also regarded as decisively shaping the character and personality of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Marius Turda| title = The idea of national superiority in Central Europe, 1880–1918| year = 2004| publisher = Edwin Mellen Press| isbn = 978-0-7734-6180-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, [[culture]] is the physical manifestation created by ethnic groupings, as such fully determined by racial characteristics. Culture and race became considered intertwined and dependent upon each other, sometimes even to the extent of including nationality or language to the set of definition. Pureness of race tended to be related to rather superficial characteristics that were easily addressed and advertised, such as blondness. Racial qualities tended to be related to nationality and language rather than the actual geographic distribution of racial characteristics. In the case of Nordicism, the denomination "Germanic" was equivalent to superiority of race.

Bolstered by some [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] values and achievements of choice, this concept of racial superiority evolved to distinguish from other cultures that were considered inferior or impure. This emphasis on culture corresponds to the modern mainstream definition of racism: "Racism does not originate from the existence of 'races'. It ''creates'' them through a process of social division into categories: anybody can be racialised, independently of their somatic, cultural, religious differences."&lt;ref&gt;National Analytical Study on Racist Violence and Crime, RAXEN Focal Point for ITALY – Annamaria Rivera {{cite web |url=http://fra.europa.eu/fra/material/pub/RAXEN/4/RV/CS-RV-NR-IT.pdf |title=Helping to make fundamental rights a reality for everyone in the European Union |author=FRA |publisher=[[Fundamental Rights Agency|European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights]] |accessdate=22 August 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110717203110/http://fra.europa.eu/fra/material/pub/RAXEN/4/RV/CS-RV-NR-IT.pdf |archivedate = July 17, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition explicitly ignores the biological concept of race, still subject to scientific debate. In the words of [[David C. Rowe]] "A racial concept, although sometimes in the guise of another name, will remain in use in biology and in other fields because scientists, as well as lay persons, are fascinated by human diversity, some of which is captured by race."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Joseph L. Graves| title = The Emperor's new clothes: biological theories of race at the millennium| year = 2001| publisher = Rutgers University Press| isbn = 978-0-8135-2847-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial prejudice became subject to international legislation. For instance, the [[Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]], adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on November 20, 1963, address racial prejudice explicitly next to discrimination for reasons of race, colour or ethnic origin (Article I).&lt;ref&gt;[http://scm.oas.org/doc_public/ENGLISH/HIST_02/CP09414E07.DOC Inter-American Convention against Racism and all forms of Discrimination and Intolerance – Study prepared by the Inter-American Juridical Committee] 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Racism has been a motivating factor in [[social discrimination]], [[racial segregation]], [[hate speech]] and violence (such as [[pogrom]]s, [[genocide]]s and [[ethnic cleansing]]s). Despite the persistence of racial [[stereotype]]s in humor and epithets in some everyday language, racial discrimination is illegal in many countries.

Some claim that [[anti-racism]] is a political instrument of abuse. In a reversal of values, anti-racism is claimed to be propagated by [[despotism|despots]] in the service of [[obscurantism]] and the suppression of women. [[New Philosophers|Philosopher]] [[Pascal Bruckner]] claimed that "[a]nti-racism in the UN has become the ideology of totalitarian regimes who use it in their own interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.signandsight.com/features/1710.html |title=Boycot Durban II |author=Pascal Bruckner|date=16 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Napoleonic War]]s, Europe was confronted with the new "[[nationalities]] question," leading to reconfigurations of the European map, on which the frontiers between the states had been delimited during the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. [[Nationalism]] had made its first appearance with the invention of the ''[[levée en masse]]'' by the [[French Revolution|French revolutionaries]], thus inventing mass [[conscription]] in order to be able to defend the newly founded [[French First Republic|Republic]] against the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' order represented by the European monarchies. This led to the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] (1792–1802) and then to the Napoleonic conquests, and to the subsequent European-wide debates on the concepts and realities of [[nation]]s, and in particular of [[nation-state]]s. The [[Westphalia Treaty]] had divided Europe into various empires and kingdoms ([[Ottoman Empire]], [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Swedish Empire]], [[France|Kingdom of France]], etc.), and for centuries wars were waged between princes (''[[Kabinettskriege]]'' in German).

Modern [[nation-state]]s appeared in the wake of the French Revolution, with the formation of [[patriotism|patriotic]] sentiments for the first time in [[Enlightenment Spain|Spain]] during the [[Peninsula War]] (1808–1813, known in Spain as the Independence War). Despite the restoration of the previous order with the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]], the "nationalities question" became the main problem of Europe during the [[Industrial Era]], leading in particular to the [[1848 Revolutions]], the [[Italian unification]] completed during the 1871 [[Franco-Prussian War]], which itself culminated in the proclamation of the [[German Empire]] in the Hall of Mirrors in the [[Palace of Versailles]], thus achieving the [[German unification]].

Meanwhile, the [[Ottoman Empire]], the "[[sick man of Europe]]", was confronted with endless nationalist movements, which, along with the dissolving of the [[Austrian-Hungarian Empire]], would lead to the creation after [[World War I]] of the various nation-states of the [[Balkan]]s, with "national [[minorities]]" in their borders.&lt;ref&gt;On this "[[nationalities]] question" and the problem of nationalism, see the relevant articles for a non-exhaustive account of the state of contemporary historical researches; famous works include: [[Ernest Gellner]], ''Nations and Nationalism'' (1983); [[Eric Hobsbawm]],''The Age of Revolution : Europe 1789–1848'' (1962), ''Nations and Nationalism since 1780 : programme, myth, reality'' (1990); [[Benedict Anderson]], ''[[Imagined Communities]]'' (1991); [[Charles Tilly]], ''Coercion, Capital and European States AD 990–1992'' (1990); [[Anthony D. Smith]], ''Theories of Nationalism'' (1971), etc.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ethnic nationalism]], which advocated the belief in a hereditary membership of the nation, made its appearance in the historical context surrounding the creation of the modern nation-states.

One of its main influences was the [[Romantic nationalist]] movement at the turn of the 19th century, represented by figures such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Johann Herder]] (1744–1803), [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Johan Fichte]] (1762–1814) in the ''Addresses to the German Nation'' (1808), [[Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831), or also, in France, [[Jules Michelet]] (1798–1874). It was opposed to [[liberal nationalism]], represented by authors such as [[Ernest Renan]] (1823–1892), who conceived of the nation as a community, which, instead of being based on the ''[[Volk]]'' ethnic group and on a specific, common language, was founded on the subjective will to live together ("the nation is a daily [[plebiscite]]", 1882) or also [[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873).&lt;ref&gt;[[John Stuart Mill]], ''Considerations on Representative Government'', 1861&lt;/ref&gt;
Ethnic nationalism blended with scientific racist discourses, as well as with "continental [[imperialist]]" ([[Hannah Arendt]], 1951&lt;ref name="Arendt"&gt;[[Hannah Arendt]], ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' (1951)&lt;/ref&gt;) discourses, for example in the [[pan-Germanism]] discourses, which postulated the racial superiority of the German Volk. The [[Alldeutscher Verband|Pan-German League]] (''Alldeutscher Verband''), created in 1891, promoted [[German colonial empire|German imperialism]], "[[racial hygiene]]" and was opposed to intermarriage with [[Jew]]s. Another popular current, the ''[[Völkisch movement]]'', was also an important proponent of the German ethnic nationalist discourse, which combined with modern [[antisemitism]]. Members of the Völkisch movement, in particular the [[Thule Society]], would participate in the founding of the [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP) in Munich in 1918, the predecessor of the [[NSDAP]] Nazi party. Pan-Germanism and played a decisive role in the [[interwar period]] of the 1920s–1930s.&lt;ref name=Arendt /&gt;

These currents began to associate the idea of the nation with the biological concept of a "[[master race]]" (often the "[[Aryan race]]" or "[[Nordic race]]") issued from the scientific racist discourse. They conflated nationalities with ethnic groups, called "races", in a radical distinction from previous racial discourses that posited the existence of a "race struggle" inside the nation and the state itself. Furthermore, they believed that political boundaries should mirror these alleged racial and ethnic groups, thus justifying [[ethnic cleansing]] in order to achieve "racial purity" and also to achieve ethnic homogeneity in the nation-state.

Such racist discourses, combined with nationalism, were not, however, limited to pan-Germanism. In France, the transition from Republican, liberal nationalism, to ethnic nationalism, which made nationalism a characteristic of [[History of far-right movements in France|far-right movements in France]], took place during the [[Dreyfus Affair]] at the end of the 19th century. During several years, a nationwide crisis affected French society, concerning the alleged treason of [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a French Jewish military officer. The country polarized itself into two opposite camps, one represented by [[Émile Zola]], who wrote ''[[J'accuse]]'' in defense of Alfred Dreyfus, and the other represented by the nationalist poet, [[Maurice Barrès]] (1862–1923), one of the founders of the ethnic nationalist discourse in France.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Barrès]], ''Le Roman de l'énergie nationale'' (The Novel of National Energy, a trilogy started in 1897)&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[Charles Maurras]] (1868–1952), founder of the monarchist ''[[Action française]]'' movement, theorized the "anti-France," composed of the "four confederate states of Protestants, Jews, Freemasons and foreigners" (his actual word for the latter being the pejorative ''[[Metic|métèques]]''). Indeed, to him the first three were all "internal foreigners", who threatened the ethnic unity of the [[French people]].

== Ethnic conflicts ==
{{Further|Ethnicity}}
Debates over the origins of racism often suffer from a lack of clarity over the term. Many use the term "racism" to refer to more general phenomena, such as [[xenophobia]] and [[ethnocentrism]], although scholars attempt to clearly distinguish those phenomena from racism as an [[ideology]] or from scientific racism, which has little to do with ordinary xenophobia. Others conflate recent forms of racism with earlier forms of ethnic and national conflict. In most cases, ethno-national conflict seems to owe itself to conflict over land and strategic resources. In some cases, [[ethnicity]] and nationalism were harnessed to rally [[combatant]]s in wars between great religious empires (for example, the Muslim Turks and the Catholic Austro-Hungarians).
[[File:Morgenthau336.jpg|thumb|Picture showing Armenians killed during the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915.]]
Notions of race and racism often have played central roles in such ethnic conflicts. Throughout history, when an adversary is identified as "other" based on notions of race or ethnicity (in particular when "other" is construed to mean "inferior"), the means employed by the self-presumed "superior" party to appropriate territory, human chattel, or material wealth often have been more ruthless, more brutal, and less constrained by [[morality|moral]] or [[ethics|ethical]] considerations. According to historian Daniel Richter, [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] saw the emergence on both sides of the conflict of "the novel idea that all Native people were 'Indians,' that all Euro-Americans were 'Whites,' and that all on one side must unite to destroy the other."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, ''Facing East from Indian Country'', p.&amp;nbsp;208&lt;/ref&gt; [[Basil Davidson]] insists in his documentary, ''[[Africa: Different but Equal]]'', that racism, in fact, only just recently surfaced—as late as the 19th century, due to the need for a justification for slavery in the Americas.

The idea of slavery as an "equal-opportunity employer" was denounced with the introduction of Christian theory in the West. Maintaining that Africans were "subhuman" was the only loophole in the then accepted law that "men are created equal" that would allow for the sustenance of the [[Triangular Trade]]. New peoples in the Americas, possible slaves, were encountered, fought, and ultimately subdued, but, then, due to European diseases, their populations drastically decreased. Through both influences, theories about "race" developed, and these helped many to justify the differences in position and treatment of people whom they categorized as belonging to different races (see Eric Wolf's ''Europe and the People without History'').

[[Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda]] argued that, during the [[Valladolid controversy]] in the middle of the 16th century, the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] were natural slaves because they had no ''souls''. In Asia, the [[Qing dynasty|Chinese]] and [[Japanese Empire]]s were both strong colonial powers, with the Chinese making colonies and vassal states of much of East Asia throughout history, and the Japanese doing the same in the 19th–20th centuries. In both cases, the Asian imperial powers believed they were ethnically and racially preferenced too.

In the 19th century, the German philosopher, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], declared that "Africa is no historical part of the world." Hegel further claimed that blacks had no "sense of personality; their spirit sleeps, remains sunk in itself, makes no advance, and thus parallels the compact, undifferentiated mass of the African continent."&lt;ref&gt;''On Blackness Without Blacks: Essays on the Image of the Black in Germany'', Boston: C.W. Hall, 1982, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fewer than 30 years before [[Nazi Germany]] instigated World War II, the Austrian, [[Otto Weininger]], claimed: "A genius has perhaps scarcely ever appeared amongst the negroes, and the standard of their morality is almost universally so low that it is beginning to be acknowledged in America that their emancipation was an act of imprudence."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sex and Character]]'', New York: G.P. Putnam, 1906, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German conservative, [[Oswald Spengler]], remarked on what he perceived as the culturally degrading influence of Africans in modern Western culture: in ''The Hour of Decision'' Spengler denounced "the 'happy ending' of an empty existence, the boredom of which has brought to [[jazz]] music and Negro dancing to perform the Death March for a great Culture."&lt;ref&gt;''The Hour of Decision'', pp. 227–228&lt;/ref&gt; During the Nazi era, German scientists rearranged academia to support claims of a grand "Aryan" agent behind the splendors of all human civilizations, including India and Ancient Egypt.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

{{Main|Scientific racism}} {{Further|Unilineal evolution}}
The modern biological definition of race developed in the 19th century with scientific racist theories. The term ''scientific racism'' refers to the use of science to justify and support racist beliefs, which goes back to the early 18th century, though it gained most of its influence in the mid-19th century, during the [[New Imperialism]] period. Also known as academic racism, such theories first needed to overcome the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]]'s resistance to [[positivism|positivist]] accounts of history and its support of [[monogenism]], the concept that all human beings were originated from the same ancestors, in accordance with [[creationist]] accounts of history.

These racist theories put forth on scientific hypothesis were combined with [[unilineal evolution|unilineal theories of social progress]], which postulated the superiority of the European civilization over the rest of the world. Furthermore, they frequently made use of the idea of "[[survival of the fittest]]", a term coined by [[Herbert Spencer]] in 1864, associated with ideas of competition, which were named [[social Darwinism]] in the 1940s. [[Charles Darwin]] himself opposed the idea of rigid racial differences in ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' (1871) in which he argued that humans were all of one species, sharing common descent. He recognised racial differences as varieties of humanity, and emphasised the close similarities between people of all races in mental faculties, tastes, dispositions and habits, while still contrasting the culture of the "lowest savages" with European civilization.&lt;ref name="dom"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=245 |title=The descent of man, and selection in relation to sex |accessdate=2007-12-02 |author=Charles Darwin |authorlink=Charles Darwin|year=1871 |publisher=John Murray|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014528/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=245 |archivedate = September 30, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Desmond| first = Adrian| author2 = James Richard Moore| title = Darwin| year = 1991| publisher = Michael Joseph, Penguin Group| isbn = 978-0-7181-3430-3| oclc = 185764721 }} pp. 28, 147, 580.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 19th century, proponents of scientific racism intertwined themselves with [[eugenics]] discourses of "[[degeneration]] of the race" and "blood [[heredity]]."{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Henceforth, scientific racist discourses could be defined as the combination of polygenism, unilinealism, social Darwinism and eugenism. They found their scientific legitimacy on [[physical anthropology]], [[anthropometry]], [[craniometry]], [[phrenology]], [[physiognomy]], and others now discredited disciplines in order to formulate racist prejudices.

Before being disqualified in the 20th century by the American school of [[cultural anthropology]] ([[Franz Boas]], etc.), the British school of [[social anthropology]] ([[Bronisław Malinowski]], [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]], etc.), the French school of [[ethnology]] ([[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], etc.), as well as the discovery of the [[Modern evolutionary synthesis|neo-Darwinian synthesis]], such sciences, in particular anthropometry, were used to deduce behaviours and psychological characteristics from outward, physical appearances.

The neo-Darwinian synthesis, first developed in the 1930s, eventually led to a [[gene-centered view of evolution]] in the 1960s. According to the [[Human Genome Project]], the most complete mapping of human DNA to date indicates that there is no clear [[Race and genetics|genetic basis to racial groups]]. While some genes are more common in certain populations, there are no genes that exist in all members of one population and no members of any other.&lt;ref name="ornl"&gt;{{cite web | title = Minorities, Race, and Genomics| url = http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/minorities.shtml | accessdate = 2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Heredity and eugenics ====
{{Further|Eugenics}}
The first theory of [[eugenics]] was developed in 1869 by [[Francis Galton]] (1822–1911), who used the then popular concept of ''[[degeneration]]''. He applied [[statistics]] to study human differences and the alleged "[[inheritance of intelligence]]", foreshadowing future uses of "[[intelligence testing]]" by the anthropometry school. Such theories were vividly described by the writer [[Émile Zola]] (1840–1902), who started publishing in 1871 a twenty-novel cycle, ''[[Les Rougon-Macquart]]'', where he linked [[heredity]] to behavior. Thus, Zola described the high-born Rougons as those involved in politics (''[[Son Excellence Eugène Rougon]]'') and medicine (''[[Le Docteur Pascal]]'') and the low-born Macquarts as those fatally falling into [[alcoholism]] (''[[L'Assommoir]]''), [[prostitution]] (''[[Nana (novel)|Nana]]''), and [[homicide]] (''[[La Bête humaine]]'').

During the rise of [[Nazi Germany|Nazism in Germany]], some scientists in Western nations worked to debunk the regime's racial theories. A few argued against racist ideologies and discrimination, even if they believed in the alleged existence of biological races. However, in the fields of anthropology and biology, these were minority positions until the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[UNESCO]], ''[[The Race Question]]'', 1950&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 1950 UNESCO statement, ''[[The Race Question]]'', an international project to debunk racist theories had been attempted in the mid-1930s. However, this project had been abandoned. Thus, in 1950, UNESCO declared that it had resumed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''up again, after a lapse of fifteen years, a project that the [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]] has wished to carry through but that it had to abandon in deference to the [[Appeasement of Hitler|appeasement policy]] of the pre-war period. The race question had become one of the pivots of [[Nazi ideology]] and policy. [[Tomáš Masaryk|Masaryk]] and [[Edvard Beneš|Beneš]] took the initiative of calling for a conference to re-establish in the minds and consciences of men everywhere the truth about race&amp;nbsp;... Nazi propaganda was able to continue its baleful work unopposed by the authority of an international organisation.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Third Reich's racial policies]], its [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics programs]] and the extermination of Jews in [[the Holocaust]], as well as [[Romani people]] in the [[Porrajmos]] (the [[Porajmos|Romani Holocaust]]) and others minorities led to a change in opinions about scientific research into race after the war.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Changes within scientific disciplines, such as the rise of the [[Franz Boas|Boasian]] school of anthropology in the United States contributed to this shift. These theories were strongly denounced in the 1950 UNESCO statement, signed by internationally renowned scholars, and titled ''[[The Race Question]]''.

==== Polygenism and racial typologies ====
{{Further|Polygenism |Typology (anthropology)}}
[[File:Passing of the Great Race - Map 4.jpg|right|thumb|Madison Grant's map, from 1916, charting the "present distribution of European races", with the [[Nordic race|Nordics]] in red, the [[Alpine race|Alpines]] in green, and the [[Mediterranean race|Mediterraneans]] in yellow.]]
Works such as [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853–1855) may be considered as one of the first theorizations of this new racism, founded on an essentialist notion of race, which opposed the former racial discourse, of [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]] for example, which saw in races a fundamentally historical reality, which changed over time. Gobineau, thus, attempted to frame racism within the terms of biological differences among humans, giving it the legitimacy of [[biology]]. He was one of the first theorists to postulate [[polygenism]], stating that there were, at the origins of the world, various discrete "races."

Gobineau's theories would be expanded, in France, by [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] (1854–1936)'s [[typology (anthropology)|typology of races]], who published in 1899 ''The Aryan and his Social Role'', in which he claimed that the white, "[[Aryan]] race", "[[Cephalic index|dolichocephalic]]", was opposed to the "brachycephalic" race, of whom the "[[Jew]]" was the archetype. Vacher de Lapouge thus created a hierarchical classification of races, in which he identified the "''[[Nordic race|Homo europaeus]]'' (Teutonic, Protestant, etc.), the "''[[Homo alpinus]]''" ([[Auvergne (province)|Auvergnat]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]], etc.), and finally the "''[[Homo mediterraneus]]''" ([[Naples|Neapolitan]], [[Andalusia|Andalus]], etc.) He assimilated races and [[social class]]es, considering that the French upper class was a representation of the ''Homo europaeus'', while the lower class represented the ''Homo alpinus''. Applying Galton's eugenics to his theory of races, Vacher de Lapouge's "selectionism" aimed first at achieving the annihilation of [[trade union]]ists, considered to be a "degenerate"; second, creating types of man each destined to one end, in order to prevent any contestation of [[labour condition]]s. His "anthroposociology" thus aimed at blocking [[social conflict]] by establishing a fixed, hierarchical social order&lt;ref&gt;Matsuo Takeshi ([[Shimane Prefecture|University of Shimane]], Japan). ''L'Anthropologie de Georges Vacher de Lapouge: Race, classe et eugénisme'' (Georges Vacher de Lapouge anthropology) in ''[[Études de langue et littérature françaises]]'' 2001, n°79, pp. 47–57.

The same year, [[William Z. Ripley]] used identical racial classification in ''[[The Races of Europe (Ripley)|The Races of Europe]]'' (1899), which would have a great influence in the United States. Other scientific authors include [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain|H.S. Chamberlain]] at the end of the 19th century (a British citizen who [[naturalization|naturalized]] himself as German because of his admiration for the "Aryan race") and [[Madison Grant]], a eugenicist and author of ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' (1916). Madison Grant provided statistics for the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], which severely restricted immigration of Jews, [[Slavs]], and southern Europeans, who were subsequently hindered in seeking to escape Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The funding of scientific racism: Wickliffe Draper and the Pioneer Fund |last=Tucker |first=William H. |authorlink=William H.

==== Human zoos ====
[[Human zoo]]s (called "People Shows"), were an important means of bolstering ''popular racism'' by connecting it to scientific racism: they were both objects of public curiosity and of [[anthropology]] and [[anthropometry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://migs.concordia.ca/occpapers/zoo.htm On A Neglected Aspect Of Western Racism], Kurt Jonassohn, December 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Human zoos – Racist theme parks for Europe's colonialists |work=[[Le Monde diplomatique]] |date = August 2000|url=http://mondediplo.com/2000/08/07humanzoo | author=Pascal Blanchard, Sandrine Lemaire and Nicolas Bancel}} ; {{cite news |title=Ces zoos humains de la République coloniale |work=[[Le Monde diplomatique]]  |date=August 2000|url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2000/08/BANCEL/14145.html|language=fr}} (available to everyone)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joice Heth]], an African American slave, was displayed by [[Phineas Taylor Barnum|P.T. Barnum]] in 1836, a few years after the exhibition of [[Saartjie Baartman]], the "Hottentot Venus", in England. Such exhibitions became common in the New Imperialism period, and remained so until World War II. [[Carl Hagenbeck]], inventor of the modern zoos, exhibited animals beside humans who were considered "savages".&lt;ref name="Diplo"&gt;[http://mondediplo.com/2000/08/07humanzoo Human Zoos], by Nicolas Bancel, Pascal Blanchard and Sandrine Lemaire, in ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', August 2000 [http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2000/08/BANCEL/14145.html French – free]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1252/is_16_131/ai_n13463375 Savages and Beasts – The Birth of the Modern Zoo], Nigel Rothfels, Johns Hopkins University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Congolese [[Pygmies|pygmy]] [[Ota Benga]] was displayed in 1906 by [[eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]], head of the [[Bronx Zoo]], as an attempt to illustrate the "missing link" between humans and [[orangutan]]s: thus, racism was tied to [[Darwinism]], creating a [[social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] ideology that tried to ground itself in [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s scientific discoveries. The 1931 Paris [[Colonial Exhibition]] displayed [[Kanaks]] from [[New Caledonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.port.ac.uk/special/france1815to2003/chapter6/interviews/filetodownload,18533,en.pdf The Colonial Exhibition of May 1931]|96.6&amp;nbsp;KB}} by Michael G. Vann, History Dept., [[Santa Clara University]], USA&lt;/ref&gt; A "Congolese village" was on display as late as 1958 at the [[Expo '58|Brussels' World Fair]].

== Evolutionary theories about the origins of racism ==
{{See also|Ethnocentrism}}
[[File:Model of ethnic &amp; ratial conflict.png|thumbnail|Sociological model of ethnic and racial conflict.]]
Biologists [[John Tooby]] and [[Leda Cosmides]] were puzzled by the fact that in the US race is one of the three characteristics most often used in brief descriptions of individuals (the others are age and sex). They reasoned that [[natural selection]] would not have favoured the evolution of an instinct for using race as a classification, because for most of human history, humans almost never encountered members of other races. Tooby and Cosmides hypothesized that modern people use race as a proxy (rough-and-ready indicator) for coalition membership, since a better-than-random guess about "which side" another person is on will be helpful if one does not actually know in advance.

Their colleague [[Robert Kurzban]] designed an experiment whose results appeared to support this hypothesis. Using the [[Memory confusion protocol]], they presented subjects with pictures of individuals and sentences, allegedly spoken by these individuals, which presented two sides of a debate. The errors that the subjects made in recalling who said what indicated that they sometimes misattributed a statement to a speaker of the same race as the "correct" speaker, although they also sometimes misattributed a statement to a speaker "on the same side" as the "correct" speaker. In a second run of the experiment, the team also distinguished the "sides" in the debate by clothing of similar colors; and in this case the effect of racial similarity in causing mistakes almost vanished, being replaced by the color of their clothing. In other words, the first group of subjects, with no clues from clothing, used race as a visual guide to guessing who was on which side of the debate; the second group of subjects used the clothing color as their main visual clue, and the effect of race became very small.&lt;ref name="KurzbanToobyCosmides2001ErasingRace"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Can race be erased?

Some research suggests that ethnocentric thinking may have actually contributed to the development of cooperation. Political scientists Ross Hammond and Robert Axelrod created a computer simulation wherein virtual individuals were randomly assigned one of a variety of skin colors, and then one of a variety of trading strategies: be color-blind, favor those of your own color, or favor those of other colors. They found that the ethnocentric individuals clustered together, then grew until all the non-ethnocentric individuals were wiped out.&lt;ref&gt;New Scientist. Issue 2595, 17 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] writes that "Blood-feuds and inter-clan warfare are easily interpretable in terms of [[W. D. Hamilton|Hamilton]]'s [[kin selection|genetic theory]]." Dawkins writes that racial prejudice, while not evolutionarily adaptive, "could be interpreted as an irrational generalization of a kin-selected tendency to identify with individuals physically resembling oneself, and to be nasty to individuals different in appearance".&lt;ref name="Dawkins2006"&gt;{{cite book| author = Richard Dawkins| title = The selfish gene| url = https://books.google.com/?id=EJeHTt8hW7UC&amp;pg=PA99| year = 2006| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-929115-1| page = 99 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simulation-based experiments in [[evolutionary game theory]] have attempted to provide an explanation for the selection of ethnocentric-strategy phenotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0022002706293470| pmc = | pmid =   | last1 = Hammond | first1 = R.

== Research on influencing factors ==
Research has examined factors influencing tolerance, in particular ethnic tolerance, prejudice, and trust. [[Authoritarian personality]] has been associated with prejudice and intolerance. [[Education]] has an inverse association which is stronger in established democracies than in emerging. Different groups are viewed differently and including illegal groups in tolerance surveys may reduce tolerance levels in all countries except the United States. Increased contact with other groups increase tolerance. Increased perception of threat, including from the home land of an ethnic minority, reduces tolerance. Competition over jobs reduces tolerance and occupational [[Racial segregation|segregation]] reduced ethnic conflicts and ethnic prejudice in studies in the United States and [[Yugoslavia]]. Tolerance is increased by democratic stability and a federal system. Increased ethnic heterogeneity increases tolerance up to a point but beyond this tolerance decreases. The negative effect of increased ethnic heterogeneity is stronger when looking at larger areas such as nations compared to smaller areas such as neighborhoods. This may be due to the contact effect being relatively more important at local levels while the threat effect becomes more important in larger areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/jet/dpaper/dpaper288.html|title=Determinants of political tolerance : a literature review|date=2 February 2011|work=repec.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study, published by [[Carl Bell (physician)|Carl Bell]], revealed that "racist attitudes may be indicative of a [[narcissistic personality disorder]] or of a regression to primitive narcissistic functioning secondary to environmental forces."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=Carl C.|date=July 1980|title=Racism: A Symptom of the Narcissistic Personality|journal=Journal of the National Medical Association|volume=72|issue=7|pages=661–665|pmid=2552506|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2552506/|pmc=2552506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ksenophontov noah.jpg|thumb|In some interpretations of the biblical story of Noah, Ham and his descendants were cursed with black skin]]
Edith Sanders in 1969 cited the [[Babylonian Talmud]], which divides mankind between the three [[sons of Noah]], stating that "the [[Hamitic|descendants of Ham]] are cursed by being black, and [it] depicts [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] as a sinful man and his progeny as degenerates."&lt;ref name="edith"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Hamitic Hypothesis: Its Origin and Functions in Time Perspective|first=Edith|last=Sanders|journal= Journal African History|volume=10|issue=4|year=1969|pages=521–532|doi=10.1017/S0021853700009683}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[curse of Ham]] has been used as an explanation for the origin of dark-skinned people since the 3rd century A.D., David M. Goldenberg (2005) writes that this was based on a theory that different climates and sun exposure effect semen composition and through this the physical composition of descendants. Furthermore, the earliest appearance of dark skin as a punishment for the descendants of Ham directly related to "Black Africans" does not appear until the 9th or 10th century (in the ''Pirqei de-Rabbenu ha-Qadosh''). Earlier sources assign the punishment of blackness to Ham himself and make no mention of the people of Kush or their skin being a curse. As well, Goldenberg goes on to explain that the earlier (3rd century) sources understood "dark skin" to include not only sub-Saharan Africa but also: &lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;the Copts, Fezzan, Zaghawa, ''Brbr'', Indians, Arabs, the people of Marw, the inhabitants of the islands in the Indian Ocean, even the Chinese, as well as the Ethiopians (Habash), Zanj, Buja, and Nubians.

[[Bernard Lewis]] has cited the [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] who, in his discussion of slavery, stated that while [[Greeks]] are free by nature, '[[barbarian]]s' (non-Greeks) are slaves by nature, in that it is in their nature to be more willing to submit to [[Despotism|despotic]] government.&lt;ref name=Lewis /&gt; Though Aristotle does not specify any particular races, he argues that people from outside Greece are more prone to the burden of slavery than those from [[Ancient Greece|Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Bernard Lewis| authorlink = Bernard Lewis| title = Race and slavery in the Middle East: an historical enquiry| year = 1992| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-505326-5| pages = 54–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such proto-racism and ethnocentrism must be looked at within context, because a modern understanding of racism based on hereditary inferiority (modern racism based in: [[eugenics]] and scientific racism) was not yet developed and it is unclear whether Aristotle believed the natural inferiority of Barbarians was caused by environment and climate (like many of his contemporaries) or by birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfylyRawl8EC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;dq=aristotle+racism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZpgwywIs_L&amp;sig=TsyiS3e2w8zqjJXRb2eyjUJzQhE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l7ZiUO-NJYbqiwKsioHIBw&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=aristotle%20racism&amp;f=false |title=The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity – Benjamin H.

Historian Dante A. Puzzo, in his discussion of Aristotle, racism, and the ancient world writes that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Racism rests on two basic assumptions: that a correlation exists between physical characteristics and moral qualities; that mankind is divisible into superior and inferior stocks. Racism, thus defined, is a modern conception, for prior to the XVIth century there was virtually nothing in the life and thought of the West that can be described as racist. To prevent misunderstanding a clear distinction must be made between racism and ethnocentrism&amp;nbsp;... The Ancient Hebrews, in referring to all who were not Hebrews as Gentiles, were indulging in ethnocentrism, not in racism.&amp;nbsp;... So it was with the Hellenes who denominated all non-Hellenes——whether the wild Scythians or the Egyptians whom they acknowledged as their mentors in the arts if civilization——Barbarians, the term denoting that which was strange or foreign.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jstor.org.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/stable/2708188?seq=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It should be noted that ethnic prejudice among some elite Arabs was not limited to darker-skinned black people, but was also directed towards fairer-skinned "ruddy people" (including [[Persian people|Persians]], Turks, Caucasians and Europeans), while Arabs referred to themselves as "swarthy people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Bernard Lewis| authorlink = Bernard Lewis| title = Race and slavery in the Middle East: an historical enquiry| year = 1992| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-505326-5| pages = 18–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Umayyad Caliphate invaded Hispania]] and founded the civilization of [[Al-Andalus]], where an era of [[La Convivencia|religious tolerance]] and a [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|Golden age of Jewish culture]] lasted for six centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Sephardim.html Sephardim]. [[Jewish Virtual Library]]. Last accessed 27 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by a violent ''[[Reconquista]]'' under the [[Reyes Catolicos|Catholic monarchs]] [[Ferdinand V of Spain|Ferdinand V]] and [[Isabella I of Spain|Isabella I]]. The Catholic [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] then formulated the ''[[Cleanliness of blood]]'' doctrine. It was during this time in history that the Western concept of aristocratic "[[Nobility#"Blue" blood|blue blood]]" emerged in a highly racialized and implicitly [[white supremacist]] context, as author Robert Lacey explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was the Spaniards who gave the world the notion that an aristocrat's blood is not red but blue. The Spanish nobility started taking shape around the ninth century in classic military fashion, occupying land as warriors on horseback. They were to continue the process for more than five hundred years, clawing back sections of the peninsula from its Moorish occupiers, and a nobleman demonstrated his pedigree by holding up his sword arm to display the filigree of blue-blooded veins beneath his pale skin—proof that his birth had not been contaminated by the dark-skinned enemy. Sangre azul, blue blood, was thus a euphemism for being a [[white people|white]] man—Spain's own particular reminder that the refined footsteps of the aristocracy through history carry the rather less refined spoor of racism.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lacey, ''Aristocrats''. Little, Brown and Company, 1983, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the expulsion of most [[Sephardic Jews]] from the Iberian peninsula, the remaining [[Jew]]s and [[Muslim]]s were forced to [[Converso|convert]] to Roman Catholicism, becoming "[[New Christian]]s" who were despised and discriminated by the "[[Old Christian]]s". An [[Inquisition]] was carried out by members of the [[Dominican Order]] in order to weed out converts that still practiced [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]] in secret. The system and ideology of the ''limpieza de sangre'' ostracized Christian converts from society, regardless of their actual degree of sincerity in their faith.

In [[Portugal]], the legal distinction between New and Old Christian was only ended through a legal decree issued by the [[Marquis of Pombal]] in 1772, almost three centuries after the implementation of the racist discrimination. The ''limpieza de sangre'' doctrine was also very common in the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonization of the Americas]], where it led to the racial separation of the various peoples in the colonies and created a very intricate list of nomenclature to describe one's precise race and, by consequence, one's place in society. This precise classification was described by [[Eduardo Galeano]] in the ''Open Veins of Latin America'' (1971). It included, among others terms, ''[[mestizo]]'' (50% Spaniard and 50% Native American), ''[[castizo]]'' (75% European and 25% Native American), ''Spaniard'' (87.5% European and 12.5% Native American), ''[[Mulatto]]'' (50% European and 50% African), ''Albarazado'' (43.75% Native American, 29.6875% European, and 26.5625% African), etc.

At the end of the [[Spanish Renaissance|Renaissance]], the [[Valladolid debate]] (1550–1551) concerning the treatment of [[Indigenous people of the Americas|natives]] of the "[[New World]]" opposed the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar and Bishop of Chiapas [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]] to another Dominican [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda]]. The latter argued that "Indians" were natural slaves because they had no souls, and were therefore beneath humanity. Thus, reducing them to slavery or serfdom was in accordance with Catholic theology and [[natural law]]. To the contrary, Bartolomé de Las Casas argued that the Amerindians were free men in the natural order and deserved the same treatment as others, according to [[Catholic theology]]. It was one of the many controversies concerning racism, slavery and [[Eurocentrism]] that would arise in the following centuries.

Although [[Christian antisemitism|antisemitism]] has a long European history, related to Christianism ([[anti-Judaism]]), racism itself is frequently described as a ''modern'' phenomenon. In the view of the French philosopher and historian [[Michel Foucault]], the first formulation of racism emerged in the [[Early modern Europe|Early Modern period]] as the "[[discourse]] of race struggle", a historical and political discourse, which Foucault opposed to the philosophical and juridical discourse of [[sovereignty]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, ''Society Must Be Defended'' (1976–77)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault thus argued that the first appearance of racism as a social [[discourse]] (as opposed to simple [[xenophobia]], which some might argue has existed in all places and times) may be found during the 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]] in Great Britain, in [[Edward Coke]] or [[John Lilburne]]'s work.

However, this "discourse of race struggle", as interpreted by Foucault, must be distinguished from the 19th century biological racism, also known as "race science" or "scientific racism". Indeed, this early modern discourse has many points of difference with modern racism. First of all, in this "discourse of race struggle", "race" is not considered a biological notion — which would divide humanity into distinct biological groups — but as a ''historical notion''. Moreover, this discourse is opposed to the sovereign's discourse: it is used by the [[bourgeoisie]], the people and the aristocracy as a mean of struggle against the monarchy. This discourse, which first appeared in Great Britain, was then carried on in France by people such as [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]], [[Nicolas Fréret]], and then, during the 1789 [[French Revolution]], [[Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès|Sieyès]], and afterward [[Augustin Thierry]] and [[Antoine Augustin Cournot|Cournot]]. Boulainvilliers, which created the matrix of such racist discourse in medieval France, conceived the "race" as something closer to the sense of "nation", that is, in his times, the "people".

He conceived France as divided between various nations — the unified [[nation-state]] is, of course, here an [[anachronism]] — which themselves formed different "races". Boulainvilliers opposed the [[absolute monarchy]], who tried to bypass the [[aristocracy]] by establishing a direct relationship to the [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]]. Thus, he created this theory of the French aristocrats as being the descendants of foreign invaders, whom he called the "[[Franks]]", while the Third Estate constituted according to him the autochthonous, vanquished [[Gallo-Romans]], who were dominated by the Frankish aristocracy as a consequence of the [[right of conquest]]. Early modern racism was opposed to nationalism and the nation-state: the [[François Dominique de Reynaud de Montlosier|Comte de Montlosier]], in exile during the French Revolution, who borrowed Boulainvilliers' discourse on the "Nordic race" as being the French aristocracy that invaded the plebeian "Gauls", thus showed his contempt for the Third Estate calling it "this new people born of slaves&amp;nbsp;... [[miscegenation|mixture of all races and of all times]]".

=== 19th century ===
While 19th century racism became closely intertwined with nationalism,&lt;ref&gt;Academic Press (2000). [http://books.google.co.za/books?id=pvHRNNk9hHEC&amp;pg=PA435&amp;dq=racism+and+ethnic+nationalism+in+the+19th+century,&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=B8DTUt2WK8qShQeKuICYDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=racism%20and%20ethnic%20nationalism%20in%20the%2019th%20century%2C&amp;f=false/ " Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Two-Volume Set, Volume 2 "].&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the [[ethnic nationalist]] discourse that identified the "race" to the "[[Volk (German word)|folk]]", leading to such movements as [[pan-Germanism]], [[Zionism]],&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;Clark, Jeanne Ellen. Engaging the Apartheid Analogy in Israel/Palestine. Willamette University. p.5&lt;/ref&gt; [[pan-Turkism]], [[pan-Arabism]], and [[pan-Slavism]], medieval racism precisely divided the nation into various non-biological "races", which were thought as the consequences of historical conquests and [[social conflict]]s. Michel Foucault traced the genealogy of modern racism to this medieval "historical and political discourse of race struggle". According to him, it divided itself in the 19th century according to two rival lines: on one hand, it was incorporated by racists, biologists and [[eugenicists]], who gave it the modern sense of "race" and, even more, transformed this popular discourse into a "[[state racism]]" (e.g. Nazism). On the other hand, [[Marxism|Marxists]] also seized this discourse founded on the assumption of a political struggle that provided the real [[philosophy of history|engine of history]] and continued to act underneath the apparent peace. Thus, Marxists transformed the [[essentialist]] notion of "race" into the historical notion of "[[class struggle]]", defined by socially structured position: capitalist or proletarian. In ''[[The Will to Knowledge]]'' (1976), Foucault analyzed another opponent of the "race struggle" discourse: [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]], which opposed the concepts of "blood [[heredity]]", prevalent in the 19th century racist discourse.

Authors such as [[Hannah Arendt]], in her 1951 book ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', have said that the racist ideology (''popular racism'') that developed at the end of the 19th century helped legitimize the [[New Imperialism|imperialist conquests]] of foreign territories and atrocities that sometimes accompanied them (such as the [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide]] of 1904–1907 or the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915–1917). [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem ''[[The White Man's Burden]]'' (1899) is one of the more famous illustrations of the belief in the inherent superiority of the [[Western culture|European culture]] over the rest of the world, though also it is also thought to be a satirical appraisal of such imperialism. Racist ideology thus helped legitimize the conquest and incorporation of foreign territories into an empire, which were regarded as a humanitarian obligation partially as a result of these racist beliefs.
[[File:Scientific racism irish.jpg|thumb|A late-19th-century illustration from ''Ireland from One or Two Neglected Points of View'' by H. Strickland Constable shows an alleged similarity between "Irish Iberian" and "Negro" features in contrast to the "higher" "Anglo-Teutonic."]]
However, during the 19th century, West European colonial powers were involved in the suppression of the [[Arab slave trade]] in Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server?show=nav.5938&amp;outputFormat=print |title=Royal Navy and the Slave Trade : Battles : History |publisher=Royal-navy.mod.uk |accessdate=2010-05-23|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110510210721/http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server?show=nav.5938&amp;outputFormat=print |archivedate = May 10, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in suppression of the [[slave trade]] in [[West Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/visit_see_victory_cfexhibition_infosheet.htm |title=Chasing Freedom Exhibition: the Royal Navy and the Suppression of the Transatlantic Slave Trade |publisher=Royalnavalmuseum.org |date=2006-11-21 |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Europeans during the time period objected to injustices that occurred in some colonies and lobbied on behalf of [[aboriginal peoples]]. Thus, when the [[Saartjie Baartman|Hottentot Venus]] was displayed in England in the beginning of the 19th century, the African Association publicly opposed itself to the exhibition. The same year that Kipling published his poem, [[Joseph Conrad]] published ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899), a clear criticism of the [[Congo Free State]] owned by [[Leopold II of Belgium]].

Examples of racial theories used include the creation of the [[Hamitic]] [[ethno-linguistic]] group during the [[European exploration of Africa]]. It was then restricted by [[Karl Friedrich Lepsius]] (1810–1877) to non-[[Semitic]] [[Afro-Asiatic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Merriam Webster (editor), ''Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'', 10 Rev Ed edition, (Merriam-Webster: 1998), p.563&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Hamite'' was applied to different populations within Africa, mainly comprising [[Ethiopia]]ns, [[Demographics of Eritrea|Eritreans]], [[Somali people|Somalis]], [[Berber people|Berbers]], and the [[Egyptians|ancient Egyptians]]. Hamites were regarded as Caucasoid peoples who probably originated in either [[Arabia]] or [[Middle East|Asia]] on the basis of their cultural, physical and linguistic similarities with the peoples of those areas.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald James Harrison, ''Africa and the Islands'', (Wiley: 1965), p.58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Dodge, ''African Politics in Perspective'', (Van Nostrand: 1966), p.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Senior, ''Tropical Lands: a human geography'', (Longman: 1979), p.59&lt;/ref&gt; Europeans considered Hamites to be more civilized than [[Black people|Black Africans]], and more akin to themselves and [[Semitic]] peoples.&lt;ref&gt;A. H. M. Jones, Elizabeth Monroe, ''History of Abyssinia'', (Kessinger Publishing: 2003), p.25&lt;/ref&gt; In the first two-thirds of the 20th century, the Hamitic race was, in fact, considered one of the branches of the [[Caucasian race]], along with the [[Aryan race|Indo-Europeans]], [[Semites]], and the [[Mediterranean race]].

However, the Hamitic peoples themselves were often deemed to have failed as rulers, which was usually ascribed to [[miscegenation|interbreeding]] with Negroes. In the mid-20th century, the German scholar [[Carl Meinhof]] (1857–1944) claimed that the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] race was formed by a merger of [[Hamitic]] and [[Negroid|Negro]] races. The Hottentots ([[Nama people|Nama]] or [[Khoi]]) were formed by the merger of Hamitic and [[Bushmen]] (San) races — both being termed nowadays as [[Khoisan]] peoples).

The slumbering volcano: American slave ship revolts and the production of rebellious masculinity. p.264. Duke University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Racism spread throughout the New World in the late 19th century and early 20th century. [[Whitecapping]], which started in Indiana in the late 19th century, soon spread throughout all of North America, causing many African laborers to flee from the land they worked on. In the US during the 1860s, racist posters were used during election campaigns. In one of these racist posters (see above), a black man is depicted lounging idly in the foreground as one white man ploughs his field and another chops wood. Accompanying labels are: "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread," and "The white man must work to keep his children and pay his taxes." The black man wonders, "Whar is de use for me to work as long as dey make dese appropriations." Above in a cloud is an image of the "Freedman's Bureau! Negro Estimate of Freedom!" The bureau is pictured as a large domed building resembling the U.S. Capitol and is inscribed "Freedom and No Work." Its columns and walls are labeled, "Candy," "Rum, Gin, Whiskey," "Sugar Plums," "Indolence," "White Women," "Apathy," "White Sugar," "Idleness," and so on.

On June 5, 1873, Sir [[Francis Galton]], distinguished English explorer and cousin of Charles Darwin, wrote in a letter to [[The Times]]:

Before [[Nazi Germany]] [[Occupation of Poland (1939–45)|invaded Poland]], Nazis prepared a special settlement plan named ''[[Generalplan Ost]]'' ("Master Plan East") which foresaw the eventual expulsion of more than 50 million non-[[Germanisation|Germanized]] Slavic peoples of [[Central Europe]] and [[Eastern Europe]] through [[forced migration]] and partial extermination of those Slavs by [[starvation]]. Also, according to the Nazi plans for Eastern Europe, some of the [[Balts]] were to be expelled beyond the [[Ural Mountains]] and into [[Siberia]]. In their place, Germans would settle in an extended "living space" (''[[Lebensraum]]'') of the 1000-Year Empire (''[[Tausendjähriges Reich]]'').

Shortly after world war II the South African [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] took control over the governance in South Africa.

Several protests and violence occurred during the [[Apartheid in South Africa]], the most famous of these include the [[Sharpeville Massacre]] in 1960, the [[Soweto uprising]] in 1976, the [[Church Street bombing]] of 1983 and the [[Cape Town peace march]] of 1989.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/575204.stm The birth and death of apartheid]".

[[State racism]]—that is, institutions and practices of a nation-state that are grounded in racist ideology—has played a major role in all instances of [[settler colonialism]], from the United States to Australia. It also played a prominent role in the Nazi German regime and [[Fascism|fascist]] regimes in Europe, and in the first part of Japan's [[Shōwa period]].

Legislative state racism is known to have been enforced by the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] of [[South Africa]] during their [[Apartheid]] regime between 1948 and 1994. Here a series of [[Apartheid legislation in South Africa]] was passed through the legal systems to make it legal for white South Africans to have rights which were superior to those of non-white South Africans. Non-white South Africans were not allowed involvement in any governing matters, including voting; access to quality healthcare; the provision of basic services, including clean water; electricity; as well as access to adequate schooling. Non-white South Africans were also prevented from accessing certain public areas, using certain public transportation and were required to live only in certain designated areas. Non-white South Africans were taxed differently from white South Africans and were required to carry on them at all times additional documentation, which later became known as "dom passes", to certify their non-white South African citizenship. All of these legislative racial laws were abolished through a series of equal human rights laws passed at the end of [[Apartheid]] in the early 1990s.

In the late 1920s in [[California]], there was animosity between the [[Filipino American|Filipinos]] and the Mexicans and between European Americans and Filipino Americans since they competed for the same jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opmanong.ssc.hawaii.edu/filipino/cali.html |title=Filipino Migrant Workers in California |publisher=Opmanong.ssc.hawaii.edu |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, there has also been an increase in racial violence between African immigrants and Blacks who have already lived in the country for generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/uncategorized/african-immigrants-face-bias-from-blacks-421654/ |title=African immigrants face bias from blacks |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=2012-03-16 |accessdate=2012-05-07 | first=Ervin | last=Dyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subconscious Racism==
Based on Forbes Leadership website, understanding race includes understanding how race operates in our minds out of awareness. Widely reported examples include significant racial bias in job applications, restaurant service, to court cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/toddessig/2014/09/21/racism-from-ferguson-to-the-nba-to-you/|title=Unconscious Racial Bias: From Ferguson To The NBA To You|author=Todd Essig|date=21 September 2014|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Social psychology|social psychologist]] [[Jennifer Eberhardt|Jennifer L. Eberhardt]], a professor in Stanford University, race can influence our visual processing and how our minds work when we are exposed to faces of different colors subliminally. As she says, "blackness is so associated with crime you're ready to pick out these crime objects." These exposures influence our mind and can cause subconscious racism in our behavior towards other people or even objects. Racism goes beyond prejudicial discrimination and bigotry. It arises from stereotypes and fears of which we are not aware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=itTHBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA202&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;dq=Racism+goes+beyond+prejudicial+discrimination+and+bigotry.+It+arises+from+stereotypes+and+fears+of+which+we+are+vastly+unaware.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vwsHYKT2Mx&amp;sig=10hzyXbn4AO31vnzhFWN7RM063w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1VUHVaafDcimoQTNhIGYBw&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Racism%20goes%20beyond%20prejudicial%20discrimination%20and%20bigotry.%20It%20arises%20from%20stereotypes%20and%20fears%20of%20which%20we%20are%20vastly%20unaware.&amp;f=false|title=Drugs, Crime, and Justice|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

This process has been studied extensively in social psychology as implicit associations and [[implicit attitude]]s, a component of [[implicit cognition]].  Implicit attitudes are evaluations that occur without conscious awareness towards an attitude object or the self. These evaluations are generally either favorable or unfavorable. They come about from various influences in the individual experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Implicit attitudes 101: Theoretical and empirical Insights|last = Devos|first = T.|publisher = Psychology Press|year = 2008|isbn = |location = New York, NY|pages = Attitudes and attitude change (pp. 61–84)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Implicit attitudes are not consciously identified (or are inaccurately identified) traces of past experience that mediate favorable or unfavorable feeling, thought, or action toward social objects.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenwald | first1 = A.G. | last2 = Banaji | first2 = M.R. | year = 1995 | title = Implicit social cognition: Attitudes, self-esteem, and stereotypes | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 102 | issue = 1| pages = 4–27 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.102.1.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These thoughts, feelings or actions have an influence on behavior of which the individual may not be aware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gawronski|first1=B|last2=Payne|first2=B.K.|title=Handbook of Implicit Social Cognition: Measurement, Theory and Application|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anti-racist-rally-Sydney-2005-Dec-18-small.jpeg|thumb|left|An anti-racism rally held outside Sydney Town Hall, December 2005.]]
Anti-racism includes beliefs, actions, movements, and policies adopted or developed to oppose racism. In general, it promotes an egalitarian society in which people are not discriminated against in race. Movements such as the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement]] and the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] were examples of anti-racist movements. [[Nonviolent resistance]] is sometimes an element of anti-racial movements, although this was not always the case. [[Hate crime]] laws, [[affirmative action]], and bans on racist speech are also examples of government policy designed to suppress racism.

=== International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination ===
UNESCO marks March 21 as the yearly [[International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]], in memory of the events that occurred on March 21, 1960 in [[Sharpeville massacre|Sharpeville]], [[South Africa]], where police killed demonstrators protesting against the [[apartheid]] regime.
