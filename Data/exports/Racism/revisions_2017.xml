{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''Racism''' is the belief in the superiority of one race over another, which often results in [[discrimination]] and [[prejudice]] towards people based on their [[race (human categorization)|race]] or [[ethnicity]]. Today, the use of the term "racism" does not easily fall under a single definition.&lt;ref name="Garner09"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/racisms/book245769 | title=Racisms: An Introduction | publisher=Sage | author=Garner, Steve | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ideology]] underlying racist practices often includes the idea that humans can be subdivided into distinct groups that are different due to their social behavior and their innate capacities as well as the idea that they can be ranked as inferior or superior.&lt;ref name="newman"&gt;{{cite book | last = Newman | first = D. M. | title = Sociology: exploring the architecture of everyday life | publisher = SAGE | location = Los Angeles | year = 2012 | edition = 9th | isbn = 978-1-4129-8729-5 | page = 405 | quote = racism: Belief that humans are subdivided into distinct groups that are different in their social behavior and innate capacities and that can be ranked as superior or inferior.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Holocaust]] is a classic example of [[institutionalized racism]] which led to the death of millions of people based on race.
While the concepts of race and ethnicity are considered to be separate in contemporary [[social science]], the two terms have a long history of equivalence in both popular usage and older social science literature. "Ethnicity" is often used in a sense close to one traditionally attributed to "race": the division of human groups based on qualities assumed to be essential or innate to the group (e.g. shared ancestry or shared behavior). Therefore, ''racism'' and ''[[racial discrimination]]'' are often used to describe discrimination on an ethnic or cultural basis, independent of whether these differences are described as racial. According to a [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|convention on racial discrimination]], there is no distinction between the terms "racial" and "ethnic" discrimination.  The UN convention further concludes that superiority based on racial differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous, and there is no justification for racial discrimination, anywhere, in theory or in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CERD.aspx|title=International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=December 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racist ideology can become manifest in many aspects of social life. Racism can be present in [[social actions]], practices, or [[Political science|political systems]] (e.g., [[apartheid]]) that support the expression of prejudice or aversion in discriminatory practices.  Associated social actions may include [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]], [[xenophobia]], [[Othering|otherness]], [[Racial segregation|segregation]], [[hierarchical]] ranking, [[supremacism]], and related social phenomena.

==Etymology, definition and usage==
{{Race}}
[[File:ProceedingsLakeMohonkConference.png|thumb|An early use of the word "racism" by [[Richard Henry Pratt]] in 1902: "''Association of races and classes is necessary to destroy racism and [[Class discrimination|classism]].''"]]
In the 19th century, many scientists subscribed to the belief that the human population can be divided into races. The term ''racism'' is a noun describing the state of being racist, i.e., subscribing to the belief that the human population can be classified according to race. The origin of the root word "race" is not clear. Linguists generally agree that it came to the English language from [[Middle French]], but there is no such agreement on how it came into Latin-based languages, generally. A recent proposal is that it derives from the [[Arabic]] ''ra's'', which means "head, beginning, origin" or the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''rosh'', which has a similar meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=race&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |title=race (n2) |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early race theorists generally held the view that some races were inferior to others and they consequently believed that the differential treatment of races was fully justified.&lt;ref name="Garner09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Canadian Encyclo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/racism/ |title=Racism |work=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=21 February 2016 |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/combating_discrimination/l33178_en.htm|work=Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA of 28 November 2008|publisher=European Union|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cerd.htm |work=UN Treaty Series |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=3 February 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61DocT4xh?url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cerd.htm |archivedate=26 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These early theories guided [[Pseudoscience|pseudo-scientific]] research assumptions; the collective endeavors to adequately define and form hypotheses about racial differences are generally termed [[scientific racism]], though this term is a misnomer due to the lack of any actual science backing the claims.

Today, most [[Biology|biologists]], [[Anthropology|anthropologists]], and [[Sociology|sociologists]] reject a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of races in favor of more specific and/or empirically verifiable criteria, such as [[geography]], ethnicity or a history of [[endogamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Does Race Exist? |journal=Scientific American |date=December 2003 |first=Michael |last=Bamshad |author2=Steve E.

An entry in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2008) simply defines [[racialism]] as "An earlier term than racism, but now largely superseded by it," and cites it in a 1902 quote.&lt;ref&gt;"racialism, n." [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/157084 OED Online]. September 2013. Oxford University Press. (Accessed December 03, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; The revised Oxford English Dictionary cites the shortened term "racism" in a quote from the following year, 1903.&lt;ref&gt;"racism, n." [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/157097 OED Online]. September 2013. Oxford University Press. (Accessed December 03, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rm42"&gt;{{cite book |last=Miles |first=Robert |title=Racism |url=https://books.google.com/?id=J9AOAAAAQAAJ|year=1989|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-01809-8|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The term "racism" was used as the title of a 1930s book, and possibly coined, by [[sexologist]] and homosexual activist [[Magnus Hirschfeld]].&lt;/ref&gt; It was first defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as "[t]he theory that distinctive human characteristics and abilities are determined by race", which gives 1936 as the first recorded use. Additionally, the Oxford English Dictionary records ''racism'' as a [[synonym]] of ''racialism'': "belief in the superiority of a particular race". By the end of [[World War II]], ''racism'' had acquired the same supremacist connotations formerly associated with ''racialism'': ''racism'' now implied racial [[discrimination]], racial [[supremacism]] and a harmful intent. (The term "race hatred" had also been used by sociologist [[Frederick Hertz]] in the late 1920s.)

As its history indicates, the popular use of the word ''racism'' is relatively recent. The word came into widespread usage in the [[Western world]] in the 1930s, when it was used to describe the social and political ideology of [[Nazism]], which saw "race" as a naturally given political unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7243.html |title=Racism: A Short History |publisher=Princeton University Press |author=Fredrickson, George M. |year=2002 |location=Princeton, NJ |page=5 |isbn=9780691116525}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly agreed that racism existed before the coinage of the word, but there is not a wide agreement on a single definition of what racism is and what it is not. Today, some scholars of racism prefer to use the concept in the plural ''racisms'' in order to emphasize its many different forms that do not easily fall under a single definition and they also argue that different forms of racism have characterized different historical periods and geographical areas.&lt;ref name="Bethen14"&gt;{{cite book |title=Racisms: From the Crusades to the Twentieth Century |publisher=Princeton University Press |author=Bethencourt, Francisco |year=2014 |location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garner (2009: p.&amp;nbsp;11) summarizes different existing definitions of racism and identifies three common elements contained in those definitions of racism. First, a historical, hierarchical [[Power (social and political)|power]] relationship between groups; second, a set of ideas (an ideology) about racial differences; and, third, discriminatory actions (practices).&lt;ref name="Garner09"/&gt;

===Legal===
Though many countries around the globe have passed [[law]]s related to race and discrimination, the first significant international [[human rights]] instrument developed by the [[United Nations]] (UN) was the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR).&lt;ref name="UNUDHR"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html |title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UDHR was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1948. The UDHR recognizes that if people are to be treated with dignity, they require [[economic rights]], [[civil rights|social rights]] including [[education]], and the rights to [[culture|cultural]] and [[politics|political]] participation and [[Civil liberties|civil liberty]]. It further states that everyone is entitled to these rights "without distinction of any kind, such as race, [[Human skin color|colour]], [[sex]], [[language]], [[religion]], political or other opinion, [[Nationality|national]] or [[society|social]] origin, property, birth or other status."

The UN does not define "racism"; however, it does define "racial discrimination": According to the 1965 UN [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]],&lt;ref name="UNICERD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CERD.aspx |title=International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination |publisher=United Nations. Adopted December 1965, entered into force January 1969 |accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;the term "racial discrimination" shall mean any distinction, exclusion, restriction, or preference based on race, colour, [[Cultural heritage|descent]], or national or [[ethnicity|ethnic]] origin that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In their 1978 [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]] Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice (Article 1), the UN states, "All human beings belong to a single species and are descended from a common stock. They are born equal in dignity and rights and all form an integral part of humanity."&lt;ref name="UNESCO78"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13161&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice |publisher=United Nations |date=1978 |accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN definition of racial discrimination does not make any distinction between discrimination based on ethnicity and race, in part because the distinction between the two has been a matter of debate among [[academia|academics]], including [[Anthropology|anthropologists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Metraux |first1=A. |year=1950 |title=United nations Economic and Security Council Statement by Experts on Problems of Race |journal=American Anthropologist |volume=53 |issue=1|pages=142–45 |doi=10.1525/aa.1951.53.1.02a00370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in [[Law of the United Kingdom|British law]] the phrase ''racial group'' means "any group of people who are defined by reference to their race, colour, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/prosecution/rrpbcrbook.html |title=Racist and Religious Crime – CPS Prosecution Policy |publisher=The CPS |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Norway]], the word "race" has been removed from national laws concerning discrimination because the use of the phrase is considered problematic and unethical.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Dagsland Holgersen (23 July 2010) [http://www.aftenposten.no/norge/Rasebegrepet-pa-vei-ut-av-loven-215256b.html Rasebegrepet på vei ut av loven] ''[[Aftenposten]]''.

===Social and behavioral science===
{{Main article|Sociology of race and ethnic relations}}
[[Sociology|Sociologists]], in general, recognize "race" as a [[Social constructivism|social construct]]. This means that, although the concepts of race and racism are based on observable biological characteristics, any conclusions drawn about race on the basis of those observations are heavily influenced by cultural ideologies. Racism, as an ideology, exists in a society at both the [[individual]] and [[institution]]al level.

While much of the research and work on racism during the last half-century or so has concentrated on "white racism" in the Western world, historical accounts of race-based social practices can be found across the globe.&lt;ref name=Gossett&gt;Gossett, Thomas F. ''Race: The History of an Idea in America''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0195097785}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, racism can be broadly defined to encompass individual and group prejudices and acts of discrimination that result in material and cultural advantages conferred on a majority or a dominant social group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Racist America: Roots, Current Realities, and Future Reparations |publisher=Routledge |author=Feagin, Joe R. |year=2000 |isbn=9780415925310}}&lt;/ref&gt; So-called "white racism" focuses on societies in which white populations are the majority or the dominant social group. In studies of these majority white societies, the aggregate of material and cultural advantages is usually termed "[[white privilege]]".

Race and race relations are prominent areas of study in [[sociology]] and [[economics]]. Much of the sociological literature focuses on white racism. Some of the earliest sociological works on racism were penned by sociologist [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], the first African American to earn a doctoral degree from [[Harvard University]]. Du Bois wrote, "The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the [[color line (civil rights issue)|color line]]."&lt;ref name="DuBois03"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Souls of Black Folk]] |publisher=Bantam Classic |author1=Du Bois |author2=W. E. B. |year=1903 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wellman (1993) defines racism as "culturally sanctioned beliefs, which, regardless of intentions involved, defend the advantages whites have because of the subordinated position of racial minorities".&lt;ref name="Wellman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wellman |first=David T. |title=Portraits of White Racism |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1993 |location=New York, NY |page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both sociology and economics, the outcomes of racist actions are often measured by the [[Social inequality|inequality]] in [[income]], [[wealth]], [[net worth]], and access to other cultural resources, such as education, between racial groups.&lt;ref name="Massey89"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hypersegregation in U.S. Metropolitan areas: Black and Hispanic Segregation Along Five Dimensions. |author1=Massey, D. |author2=N. Denton |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Demography |year=1989 |volume=26 |pages=378–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In sociology and [[social psychology]], [[Identity (social science)|racial identity]] and the acquisition of that identity, is often used as a variable in racism studies. Racial ideologies and racial identity affect individuals' perception of race and discrimination. Cazenave and Maddern (1999) define racism as "a highly organized system of 'race'-based group privilege that operates at every level of society and is held together by a sophisticated ideology of color/'race' supremacy. Racial centrality (the extent to which a culture recognizes individuals' racial identity) appears to affect the degree of discrimination African American young adults perceive whereas racial ideology may buffer the detrimental emotional effects of that discrimination.&lt;ref name="Cazenave"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Defending the White Race: White Male Faculty Opposition to a White Racism Course|author1=Cazenave, Noel A |author2=Darlene Alvarez Maddern |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Race and Society |year=1999 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=25–50 |doi=10.1016/s1090-9524(00)00003-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sellers and Shelton (2003) found that a relationship between racial discrimination and emotional distress was moderated by racial ideology and social beliefs.&lt;ref name="Sellers03"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The role of racial identity in perceived racial discrimination|author1=Sellers RM |author2=JN Shelton |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=2003 |volume=84 |issue=5 |pages=1079–92 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.84.5.1079|pmid=12757150 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sociologists also argue that, particularly in the West where racism is often [[Social control|negatively sanctioned]] in society, racism has changed from being a blatant to a more covert expression of racial prejudice. The "newer" (more hidden and less easily detectable) forms of racism—which can be considered embedded in social processes and structures—are more difficult to explore as well as challenge. It has been suggested that, while in many countries overt or explicit racism has become increasingly [[taboo]], even among those who display egalitarian explicit attitudes, an [[Implicit-association test|implicit]] or [[aversive racism]] is still maintained subconsciously.&lt;ref name="Greenwald" /&gt;

This process has been studied extensively in social psychology as implicit associations and [[implicit attitude]]s, a component of [[implicit cognition]]. Implicit attitudes are evaluations that occur without conscious awareness towards an attitude object or the self. These evaluations are generally either favorable or unfavorable. They come about from various influences in the individual experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Implicit attitudes 101: Theoretical and empirical Insights|last=Devos|first=T.|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2008|location=New York, NY|chapter=Attitudes and attitude change |pages=61–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implicit attitudes are not consciously identified (or they are inaccurately identified) traces of past experience that mediate favorable or unfavorable feeling, thought, or action towards social objects.&lt;ref name="Greenwald"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Greenwald |first1=A.G. |last2=Banaji |first2=M.R. |year=1995 |title=Implicit social cognition: Attitudes, self-esteem, and stereotypes |url=|journal=Psychological Review |volume=102 |issue=1|pages=4–27 |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.102.1.4 |pmid=7878162|citeseerx=10.1.1.304.6161 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These thoughts, feelings or actions have an influence on behavior of which the individual may not be aware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gawronski|first1=B|last2=Payne|first2=B.K.|title=Handbook of Implicit Social Cognition: Measurement, Theory and Application|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, subconscious racism can influence our visual processing and how our minds work when we are subliminally exposed to faces of different colors. In thinking about crime, for example, [[Social psychology|social psychologist]] [[Jennifer Eberhardt|Jennifer L. Eberhardt]] (2004) of [[Stanford University]] holds that, "blackness is so associated with crime you're ready to pick out these crime objects."&lt;ref name="Eberhardt04"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Seeing Black: Race, Crime, and Visual Processing |author=Eberhardt, Jennifer L. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=2004 |volume=87 |issue=6 |pages=876–93 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.87.6.876|display-authors=etal |pmid=15598112|citeseerx=10.1.1.408.3542 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such exposures influence our minds and they can cause subconscious racism in our behavior towards other people or even towards objects. Thus, racist thoughts and actions can arise from stereotypes and fears of which we are not aware.&lt;ref name="Eberhardt14"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=itTHBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA202&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;dq=Racism+goes+beyond+prejudicial+discrimination+and+bigotry.+It+arises+from+stereotypes+and+fears+of+which+we+are+vastly+unaware.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vwsHYKT2Mx&amp;sig=10hzyXbn4AO31vnzhFWN7RM063w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1VUHVaafDcimoQTNhIGYBw&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Racism%20goes%20beyond%20prejudicial%20discrimination%20and%20bigotry.%20It%20arises%20from%20stereotypes%20and%20fears%20of%20which%20we%20are%20vastly%20unaware.&amp;f=false |title=Drugs, Crime, and Justice |publisher=Sage |date=2014 |author=Belenko, Steven and [[Cassia Spohn]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanities===
[[Language]], [[linguistics]] and [[discourse]] are active areas of study in the [[humanities]], along with [[literature]] and the [[The arts|arts]]. [[Discourse analysis]] seeks to reveal the meaning of race and the actions of racists through careful study of the ways in which these factors of human society are described and discussed in various written and oral works. Van Dijk (1992), for example, examines the different ways in which descriptions of racism and racist actions are depicted by the perpetrators of such actions as well as by their victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analyzing Racism Through Discourse Analysis Some Methodological Reflections in Race and Ethnicity in Research Methods |publisher=Sage |author=Van Dijk, Tuen |year=1992 |location=Newbury Park, CA |pages=92–134 |isbn=978-0803950078}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that when descriptions of actions have negative implications for the majority, and especially for white elites, they are often seen as controversial and such controversial interpretations are typically marked with quotation marks or they are greeted with expressions of distance or doubt. The previously cited book, ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]]'' by W.E.B. Du Bois, represents early [[African-American literature]] that describes the author's experiences with racism when he was traveling in the [[Southern United States|South]] as an African American.

Much American fictional literature has focused on issues of racism and the black "racial experience" in the US, including works written by whites such as ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', and ''[[Imitation of Life (novel)|Imitation of Life]]'', or even the non-fiction work ''[[Black Like Me]]''. These books, and others like them, feed into what has been called the "[[white savior narrative in film]]", in which the heroes and heroines are white even though the story is about things that happen to black characters. [[Content analysis|Textual analysis]] of such writings can contrast sharply with black authors' descriptions of African Americans and their experiences in US society. African American writers have sometimes been portrayed in [[African-American studies]] as retreating from racial issues when they write about "[[Whiteness studies|whiteness]]", while others identify this as an African American literary tradition called "the literature of white estrangement", part of a multipronged effort to challenge and dismantle [[white supremacy]] in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Souls of White Folk: African American Writers Theorize Whiteness |publisher=The University Press of Mississippi |author=Watson, Veronica T. |year=2013 |location=Jackson, MS |page=137 |isbn=9781496802453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racism can be said to describe a condition in society in which a dominant racial group benefits from the [[oppression]] of others, whether that group wants such benefits or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reverse-racism-isnt-a-thing_us_55d60a91e4b07addcb45da97 |title='Reverse Racism': 4 Myths That Need To Stop |date=26 August 2015 |accessdate=28 February 2016 |author=Blay, Zeba |publisher=Huffpost Black Voices}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foucauldian scholar Ladelle McWhorter in her 2009 book ''Racism and Sexual Oppression in Anglo-America: A Genealogy'' posits modern racism similarly, focusing on the notion of a dominant group, usually whites, vying for racial purity and progress, rather than an overt or obvious ideology focused on the oppression of nonwhites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/406565635|title=Racism and sexual oppression in Anglo-America : a genealogy|last=1960-|first=McWhorter, Ladelle,|date=2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253352965|location=Bloomington|oclc=406565635}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In popular usage, as in some academic usage, little distinction is made between "racism" and "[[ethnocentrism]]". Often, the two are listed together as "racial and ethnic" in describing some action or outcome that is associated with prejudice within a majority or dominant group in society. Furthermore, the meaning of the term racism is often conflated with the terms prejudice, [[bigotry]], and discrimination. Racism is a complex concept that can involve each of those, but it cannot be equated with nor is it synonymous with these other terms.

Also, the term is often used in relation to what is seen as prejudice within a minority or subjugated group, as in the concept of "[[reverse racism]]". Reverse racism describes discriminatory actions by members of a minority group against a dominant or formerly dominant racial or other group representative of the majority in a particular society.&lt;ref name="Norton Sommers 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science |issue=3 |laydate=May 23, 2011 |laysource=TuftsNow |laysummary=http://now.tufts.edu/news-releases/whites-believe-they-are-victims-racism-more-o |title=Whites See Racism as a Zero-Sum Game That They Are Now Losing |year=2011 |pages=215–18 |doi=10.1177/1745691611406922 |author1=Norton, Michael I. |author2=Samuel R. Sommers |lastauthoramp=yes |volume=6 |pmid=26168512}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who campaign for the interests of ethnic minorities commonly reject the term "reverse racism". From their perspective, "racism" is defined not only in terms of individual prejudice, but also in terms of a power structure which protects the interests of the dominant culture and actively discriminates against ethnic minorities. From this perspective, they claim that while members of ethnic minorities may be prejudiced against members of the dominant culture, they lack the political and economic power to actively oppress them, and they are therefore incapable of "racism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Emily Torbett|title=Reverse racism: Can't exist by definition, insulting to minority groups|url=http://www.thedaonline.com/opinion/article_25e8b7cc-47bc-11e5-bb94-7f79b1590106.html |work=The Daily Athenaeum|accessdate=February 3, 2017|date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, the word "racism" appears to have been coined by [[Magnus Hirschfeld]], a German-[[Jewish]] medical researcher who specialized in the field of [[sexology]], or the scientific study of sex. The second edition of the Oxford English Dictionary (1989) lists the first known use of the word in English as appearing in the 1936 book ''[[The Coming American Fascism]]'' by [[Lawrence Dennis]], a self-described [[fascist]] and advocate of [[fascism in North America|fascism]] in America. However, Hirschfeld, who died in 1935, used the word in the title of his book ''Racism'', written in German a year before the first known use of the word by Dennis, and the word "racism" is used throughout the text. The word is a pejorative and was always intended as such; Hirschfeld himself denounced those he viewed as racist, and very few if any people use the word to describe themselves or their ideas, only those ideas they disagree with or find reprehensible.

==Aspects==
The ideology underlying racism can become manifest in many aspects of social life.  Such aspects are described in this section, although the list is not exhaustive.

===Aversive racism===
{{main article|Aversive racism}}
Aversive racism is a form of implicit racism in which a person's unconscious negative evaluations of racial or ethnic minorities are realized by a persistent avoidance of interaction with other racial and ethnic groups. As opposed to traditional, overt racism, which is characterized by overt hatred for and explicit discrimination against racial/ethnic minorities, aversive racism is characterized by more complex, [[ambivalence|ambivalent]] expressions and attitudes.&lt;ref name="Gaertner"&gt;{{cite book |year=1986 |chapter=The aversive form of racism |pages=61–89 |editor1-first=John F. |editor1-last=Dovidio |editor2-first=Samuel L. |editor2-last=Gaertner |title=Prejudice, Discrimination and Racism |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-221425-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aversive racism is similar in implications to the concept of symbolic or modern racism (described below), which is also a form of implicit, unconscious, or covert attitude which results in unconscious forms of discrimination.

The term was coined by Joel Kovel to describe the subtle racial behaviors of any ethnic or racial group who rationalize their aversion to a particular group by appeal to rules or stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Gaertner"/&gt; People who behave in an aversively racial way may profess egalitarian beliefs, and will often deny their racially motivated behavior; nevertheless they change their behavior when dealing with a member of another race or ethnic group than the one they belong to. The motivation for the change is thought to be implicit or subconscious. Experiments have provided empirical support for the existence of aversive racism. Aversive racism has been shown to have potentially serious implications for decision making in employment, in legal decisions and in helping behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(04)36001-6 |chapter=Aversive Racism |title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology |year=2004 |last1=Dovidio |first1=John F. |last2=Gaertner |first2=Samuel L. |isbn=978-0-12-015236-0 |volume=36 |pages=1–52 |editor1-first=James M. |editor1-last=Olson |editor2-first=Mark P. |editor2-last=Zanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0901_1 |title=Differences in Helping Whites and Blacks: A Meta-Analysis |year=2005 |last1=Saucier |first1=Donald A. |last2=Miller |first2=Carol T. |last3=Doucet |first3=Nicole |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review |volume=9 |pages=2–16 |pmid=15745861 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Color blindness===
{{main article|Color blindness (race) in the United States}}
In relation to racism, Color blindness is the disregard of racial characteristics in [[social interaction]], for example in the rejection of affirmative action, as way to address the results of past patterns of discrimination. Critics of this attitude argue that by refusing to attend to racial disparities, racial color blindness in fact unconsciously perpetuates the patterns that produce racial inequality.

[[Eduardo Bonilla-Silva]] argues that color blind racism arises from an "abstract [[liberalism]], biologization of culture, naturalization of racial matters, and minimization of racism".&lt;ref name="Bonilla-Silva"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bonilla-Silva | first = Eduardo | authorlink = Eduardo Bonilla-Silva | title= White Supremacy and Racism in the Post-Civil Rights Era | publisher = Lynne Rienner Publishers, Inc| year = 2001 | pages = 137–66 | isbn = 978-1-58826-032-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Color blind practices are "subtle, [[institution]]al, and apparently nonracial"&lt;ref name=Bonilla-Silva1&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonilla-Silva|first=Eduardo|title=Racism without Racists: Color-blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in the United States|year=2003|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield| location=Lanham| isbn=978-0-7425-1633-5| pages=2–29| url=https://books.google.com/?id=6IG7QgAACAAJ&amp;dq=racism+without+racists}}&lt;/ref&gt; because race is explicitly ignored in decision making. If race is disregarded in predominately white populations, for example, whiteness becomes the [[norm (social)|normative]] standard, whereas [[people of color]] are [[Othering|othered]], and the racism these individuals experience may be minimized or erased.&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Race Is – Race Isn't: Critical Race Theory and Qualitative Studies in Education |last=Parker |first=Laurence |year=1999 |publisher=Westview Press |location= |isbn=0-8133-9069-9 |page=184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Social"&gt;{{cite book | title=Our Social World: Introduction to Sociology (Condensed Version) | publisher=SAGE | year=2015 | location=Los Angeles | isbn=9781452275758 | first1=Jeanne H. | last1=Ballantine | first2=Keith A. | last2=Roberts | edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an individual level, people with "color blind prejudice" reject racist ideology, but also reject systemic policies intended to fix [[institutional racism]].&lt;ref name="Social" /&gt;

===Cultural===
{{see also|Xenophobia}}
Cultural racism is a term used to describe and explain new racial ideologies and practices that have emerged since World War II. It can be defined as societal beliefs and customs that promote the assumption that the products of a given culture, including the language and traditions of that culture are superior to those of other cultures. It shares a great deal with [[xenophobia]], which is often characterised by fear of, or aggression toward, members of an [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]] by members of an [[Ingroups and outgroups|ingroup]].

Cultural racism exists when there is a widespread acceptance of stereotypes concerning different ethnic or population groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14649360120047788#.VDMHQRYYnWc|title=Cultural racism: Something rotten in the state of Denmark?|journal=Social &amp; Cultural Geography|doi=10.1080/14649360120047788|first=Karen|last=Wren|volume=2|issue=2|year=2001|pages=141–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where racism can be characterised by the belief that one race is inherently superior to another, cultural racism can be characterised by the belief that one culture is inherently superior to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~lnp3/mydocs/Blaut/racism.htm|title=The Theory of Cultural Racism|journal=Antipode: A Radical Journal of Geography|volume=24|issue=4|year=1992|pages=289–99|first=James M.|last=Blaut|authorlink=James Morris Blaut|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8330.1992.tb00448.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===

[[File:Boycot Jews april 1 1933.jpeg|thumb|[[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses]], Germany, 1933]]

Historical economic or social disparity is alleged to be a form of [[discrimination]] caused by past racism and historical reasons, affecting the present generation through deficits in the formal education and kinds of preparation in previous generations, and through primarily unconscious racist attitudes and actions on members of the general population.

In 2011, [[Bank of America]] agreed to pay $335&amp;nbsp;million to settle a federal government claim that its mortgage division, Countrywide Financial, [[Mortgage discrimination|discriminated]] against black and Hispanic homebuyers.&lt;ref name="america"&gt;{{cite news|title=Countrywide Will Settle a Bias Suit|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/22/business/us-settlement-reported-on-countrywide-lending.html|date=December 21, 2011|first=Charlie|last=Savage|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=December 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Colonial spain|Spanish colonial period]], Spaniards developed a complex [[Castas|caste system]] based on race, which was used for social control and which also determined a person's importance in society.&lt;ref name="Acuña-p23-24"&gt;{{cite book| last = Acuña| first = Rodolfo F.| authorlink = Rodolfo F.

===Institutional===
{{Further information|Institutional racism|State racism|Affirmative action|Racial profiling|Racism by country}}
[[Institutional racism]] (also known as structural racism, [[state racism]] or systemic racism) is racial discrimination by governments, corporations, religions, or educational institutions or other large organizations with the power to influence the lives of many individuals. [[Stokely Carmichael]] is credited for coining the phrase ''institutional racism'' in the late 1960s. He defined the term as "the collective failure of an organization to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin".&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Race, [http://www.shef.ac.uk/socstudies/Shop/race_article.pdf Analysing ethnic education policy-making in England and Wales], ''Sheffield Online Papers in Social Research'', University of Sheffield, p. 12. Retrieved 20 June 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923102013/http://www.shef.ac.uk/socstudies/Shop/race_article.pdf |date=September 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maulana Karenga]] argued that racism constituted the destruction of culture, language, religion, and human possibility and that the effects of racism were "the morally monstrous destruction of human possibility involved redefining African humanity to the world, poisoning past, present and future relations with others who only know us through this stereotyping and thus damaging the truly human relations among peoples".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karenga|first1=Maulana|title=The Ethics of Reparations: Engaging the Holocaust of Enslavement|url=http://www.ncobraonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Karenga-THE-ETHICS-OF-REPARATIONS.pdf|publisher=[[The National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America]] (N'COBRA)|accessdate=31 January 2017|date=22–23 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Othering===
{{main article|Othering}}
Othering is the term used by some to describe a system of discrimination whereby the characteristics of a group are used to distinguish them as separate from the norm.&lt;ref&gt;Mountz, Alison. (2009) ''Key Concepts in Political Geography.'' SAGE. p. 328&lt;/ref&gt;

Othering plays a fundamental role in the history and continuation of racism. To objectify a culture as something different, exotic or underdeveloped is to generalize that it is not like 'normal' society. Europe's colonial attitude towards the Orient exemplifies this as it was thought that the East was the opposite of the West; feminine where the West was masculine, weak where the West was strong and traditional where the West was progressive.&lt;ref name="Said, Edward 1978 pp.357"&gt;Said, Edward. (1978) ''Orientalism''. New York: Pantheon Books. p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; By making these generalizations and othering the East, Europe was simultaneously defining herself as the norm, further entrenching the gap.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Derek. (2004). ''The Colonial Present''. Blackwell publishers. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the process of othering relies on imagined difference, or the expectation of difference. Spatial difference can be enough to conclude that "we" are "here" and the "others" are over "there".&lt;ref name="Said, Edward 1978 pp.357"/&gt; Imagined differences serve to categorize people into groups and assign them characteristics that suit the imaginer's expectations.&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward. (1978) ''Orientalism''. New York: Pantheon Books. p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial segregation is the separation of humans into [[Race (human categorization)|socially-constructed racial groups]] in daily life. It may apply to activities such as eating in a restaurant, drinking from a water fountain, using a bath room, attending school, going to the movies, or in the rental or purchase of a home.&lt;ref&gt;''Principles to Guide Housing Policy at the Beginning of the Millennium'', Michael Schill &amp; Susan Wachter, [[Cityscape]]&lt;/ref&gt; Segregation is generally outlawed, but may exist through social norms, even when there is no strong individual preference for it, as suggested by [[Thomas Schelling]]'s models of segregation and subsequent work.

===Symbolic/modern===
{{Main article|Symbolic racism}}
[[File:Little Rock integration protest.jpg|thumb|left|A rally against [[Desegregation busing|school integration]] in 1959.]]
Some scholars argue that in the US earlier violent and aggressive forms of racism have evolved into a more subtle form of prejudice in the late 20th century. This new form of racism is sometimes referred to as "modern racism" and it is characterized by outwardly acting unprejudiced while inwardly maintaining prejudiced attitudes, displaying subtle prejudiced behaviors such as actions informed by attributing qualities to others based on racial stereotypes, and evaluating the same behavior differently based on the race of the person being evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, E., Wilson, T. D., &amp; Akert, R. M. (2010). ''Social Psychology'' (7th edition). New York: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt; This view is based on studies of prejudice and discriminatory behavior, where some people will act ambivalently towards black people, with positive reactions in certain, more public contexts, but more negative views and expressions in more private contexts. This ambivalence may also be visible for example in hiring decisions where job candidates that are otherwise positively evaluated may be unconsciously disfavored by employers in the final decision because of their race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McConahay | first1 = J.

B. (1986). Modern racism, ambivalence, and the modern racism scale.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars consider modern racism to be characterized by an explicit rejection of stereotypes, combined with resistance to changing structures of discrimination for reasons that are ostensibly non-racial, an ideology that considers opportunity at a purely individual basis denying the relevance of race in determining individual opportunities and the exhibition of indirect forms of micro-aggression toward and/or avoidance of people of other races.&lt;ref&gt;Pettigrew, T. F. (1989). "The nature of modern racism in the United States". ''Revue Internationale de Psychologie Sociale''.
Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subconscious biases===
Recent research has shown that individuals who consciously claim to reject racism may still exhibit race-based subconscious biases in their decision-making processes. While such "subconscious racial biases" do not fully fit the definition of racism, their impact can be similar, though typically less pronounced, not being explicit, conscious or deliberate.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (March 30, 2015) [http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/biases-back-mind-affect-feel-race/ "How the biases in the back of your mind affect how you feel about race"] ''[[PBS Newshour]]'' Accessed: October 9, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==International law and racial discrimination==
In 1919, a [[Racial Equality Proposal, 1919|proposal]] to include a racial equality provision in the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]] was supported by a majority, but not adopted in the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]]. In 1943, Japan and its allies declared work for the abolition of racial discrimination to be their aim at the [[Greater East Asia Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=C. Peter Chen |url=http://ww2db.com/battle_spec.php?battle_id=70%20WW2DB:%20Greater%20East%20Asia%20Conference |title=Joint Declaration of the Greater East Asia Conference (below) |publisher=Ww2db.com |date=1945-02-23 |accessdate=2011-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 1 of the 1945 [[UN Charter]] includes "promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race" as UN purpose.

In 1950, [[UNESCO]] suggested in ''[[The Race Question]]''—a statement signed by 21 scholars such as [[Ashley Montagu]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Gunnar Myrdal]], [[Julian Huxley]], etc.—to "drop the term ''race'' altogether and instead speak of [[ethnic groups]]". The statement condemned [[scientific racism]] theories that had played a role in [[the Holocaust]]. It aimed both at debunking scientific racist theories, by popularizing modern knowledge concerning "the race question," and morally condemned racism as contrary to the philosophy of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and its assumption of [[Social equality|equal rights]] for all. Along with Myrdal's ''[[An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy]]'' (1944), ''The Race Question'' influenced the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court [[racial segregation in the United States|desegregation]] decision in "[[Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka]]".&lt;ref name="Prins"&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=30431&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html "Toward a World without Evil: Alfred Métraux as UNESCO Anthropologist (1946–1962)"], by [[Harald E.L.

The United Nations use the definition of racial discrimination laid out in the ''[[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]]'', adopted in 1966:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...&amp;nbsp;any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, color, descent, or national or ethnic origin that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.

Racism existed during the 19th century as "[[scientific racism]]", which attempted to provide a [[typology (anthropology)|racial classification]] of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre-André Taguieff]], ''La force du préjugé'', 1987 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1775 [[Johann Blumenbach]] divided the world's population into five groups according to skin color (Caucasians, Mongols, etc.), positing the view that the non-caucasians had arisen through a process of degeneration. Another early view in scientific racism was the [[Polygenism|polygenist view]], which held that the different races had been separately created. Polygenist [[Christoph Meiners]] for example, split mankind into two divisions which he labeled the "beautiful White race" and the "ugly Black race". In Meiners' book, ''The Outline of History of Mankind'', he claimed that a main characteristic of race is either beauty or ugliness. He viewed only the white race as beautiful. He considered ugly races to be inferior, immoral and animal-like.

[[Anders Retzius]] demonstrated that neither Europeans nor others are one "pure race", but of mixed origins. While [[Typology (anthropology)#Typology|discredited]], derivations of Blumenbach's taxonomy are [[Definitions of whiteness in the United States|still widely used]] for the classification of the population in the United States. [[:dk::Hans Petter Steensby|H. P. Steensby]], while strongly emphasizing that all humans today are of mixed origins, in 1907 claimed that the origins of human differences must be traced extraordinarily far back in time, and conjectured that the "purest race" today would be the [[Australian Aboriginals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://img.kb.dk/tidsskriftdk/pdf/gto/gto_0019-PDF/gto_0019_67206.pdf |title=Race Studies in Denmark |journal=[[Danish Journal of Geography|Geografisk Tidsskrift]] |publisher= |volume=19 |language=Danish |year=1907 |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific racism fell strongly out of favor in the early 20th Century, but the origins of fundamental human and societal differences are still researched within [[academia]], in fields such as [[human genetics]] including [[paleogenetics]], [[social anthropology]], [[comparative politics]], [[history of religions]], [[history of ideas]], [[prehistory]], [[history]], [[ethics]], and [[psychiatry]]. There is widespread rejection of any methodology based on anything similar to Blumenbach's races. It is more unclear to which extent and when [[ethnic stereotype|ethnic]] and [[nation]]al [[archetype|stereotypes]] are accepted.

Although after [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]], racist ideologies were discredited on ethical, political and scientific grounds, racism and racial discrimination have remained widespread around the world. From time to time when there is a revival of social and political tensions, new works are published which repeat past and discredited racial views such as J R Baker's 'Race'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/27071070/Science_Racism_and_Social_Darwinism_A_Review_of_Race_by_JR_Baker |title=Science, Racism and Social Darwinism – a review of Race by J R Baker |last=Ladimeji|first=O.A. |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the social disapproval of explicit expressions of racism, contemporary authors may achieve a similar effect by insinuating subtle unstated stereotypes in their work as in Gladwell's 'The Tipping Point',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/11720654/Racism_and_homophobia_in_Gladwells_Tipping_Point |title=Racism and homophobia in Gladwell's Tipping Point|last=Ladimeji |first= O.A.|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a tactic [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] called 'dog whistle racism'.

[[W.E.B. Du Bois|Du Bois]] observed that it is not so much "race" that we think about, but culture: "...&amp;nbsp;a common history, common laws and religion, similar habits of thought and a conscious striving together for certain ideals of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=1119 |title=The Conservation of Races |last=DuBois|first=W. E. B. |year=1897 |page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Late 19th century nationalists were the first to embrace contemporary discourses on "race", ethnicity, and "[[survival of the fittest]]" to shape new nationalist doctrines. Ultimately, race came to represent not only the most important traits of the human body, but was also regarded as decisively shaping the character and personality of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Marius Turda| title = The idea of national superiority in Central Europe, 1880–1918| year = 2004| publisher = Edwin Mellen Press| isbn = 978-0-7734-6180-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, [[culture]] is the physical manifestation created by ethnic groupings, as such fully determined by racial characteristics. Culture and race became considered intertwined and dependent upon each other, sometimes even to the extent of including nationality or language to the set of definition. Pureness of race tended to be related to rather superficial characteristics that were easily addressed and advertised, such as blondness. Racial qualities tended to be related to nationality and language rather than the actual geographic distribution of racial characteristics. In the case of Nordicism, the denomination "Germanic" was equivalent to superiority of race.

Bolstered by some [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] values and achievements of choice, this concept of racial superiority evolved to distinguish from other cultures that were considered inferior or impure. This emphasis on culture corresponds to the modern mainstream definition of racism: "Racism does not originate from the existence of 'races'. It ''creates'' them through a process of social division into categories: anybody can be racialised, independently of their somatic, cultural, religious differences."&lt;ref&gt;National Analytical Study on Racist Violence and Crime, RAXEN Focal Point for ITALY – Annamaria Rivera {{cite web |url=http://fra.europa.eu/fra/material/pub/RAXEN/4/RV/CS-RV-NR-IT.pdf |title=Helping to make fundamental rights a reality for everyone in the European Union |author=FRA |publisher=[[Fundamental Rights Agency|European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights]] |accessdate=22 August 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081216225620/http://fra.europa.eu/fra/material/pub/RAXEN/4/RV/CS-RV-NR-IT.pdf|archivedate=December 16, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition explicitly ignores the biological concept of race, still subject to scientific debate. In the words of [[David C. Rowe]] "A racial concept, although sometimes in the guise of another name, will remain in use in biology and in other fields because scientists, as well as lay persons, are fascinated by human diversity, some of which is captured by race."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Joseph L. Graves| title = The Emperor's new clothes: biological theories of race at the millennium| year = 2001| publisher = Rutgers University Press| isbn = 978-0-8135-2847-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial prejudice became subject to international legislation. For instance, the [[Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]], adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on November 20, 1963, address racial prejudice explicitly next to discrimination for reasons of race, colour or ethnic origin (Article I).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070808133610/http://scm.oas.org/doc_public/ENGLISH/HIST_02/CP09414E07.DOC Inter-American Convention against Racism and all forms of Discrimination and Intolerance – Study prepared by the Inter-American Juridical Committee] 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnicity and ethnic conflicts==
{{Further information|Ethnicity}}
Debates over the origins of racism often suffer from a lack of clarity over the term. Many use the term "racism" to refer to more general phenomena, such as [[xenophobia]] and [[ethnocentrism]], although scholars attempt to clearly distinguish those phenomena from racism as an [[ideology]] or from scientific racism, which has little to do with ordinary xenophobia. Others conflate recent forms of racism with earlier forms of ethnic and national conflict. In most cases, ethno-national conflict seems to owe itself to conflict over land and strategic resources. In some cases, [[ethnicity]] and [[nationalism]] were harnessed in order to rally [[combatant]]s in wars between great religious empires (for example, the Muslim Turks and the Catholic Austro-Hungarians).
[[File:Woundedknee1891.jpg|thumb|A mass grave being dug for frozen bodies from the 1890 [[Wounded Knee Massacre]], in which the U.S. Army killed 150 [[Lakota people]], marking the end of the [[American Indian Wars]].]]
Notions of race and racism have often played central roles in [[ethnic conflict]]s. Throughout history, when an adversary is identified as "other" based on notions of race or ethnicity (in particular when "other" is construed to mean "inferior"), the means employed by the self-presumed "superior" party to appropriate territory, human chattel, or material wealth often have been more ruthless, more brutal, and less constrained by [[morality|moral]] or [[ethics|ethical]] considerations. According to historian Daniel Richter, [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] saw the emergence on both sides of the conflict of "the novel idea that all Native people were 'Indians,' that all Euro-Americans were 'Whites,' and that all on one side must unite to destroy the other."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, ''Facing East from Indian Country'', p.&amp;nbsp;208&lt;/ref&gt; [[Basil Davidson]] states in his documentary, ''Africa: Different but Equal'', that racism, in fact, only just recently surfaced—as late as the 19th century, due to the need for a justification for slavery in the Americas.

Historically, racism was a major driving force behind the [[Transatlantic slave trade]].&lt;ref&gt;Fredrickson, George M. 1988. The arrogance of race: historical perspectives on slavery, racism, and social inequality. Middletown, Conn: Wesleyan University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also a major force behind [[racial segregation]], especially in the [[United States]] in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and [[South Africa]] under [[apartheid]]; 19th and 20th century racism in [[Western culture|Western world]] is particularly well documented and constitutes a reference point in studies and discourses about racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Racism : a global reader | first1 = Kevin | last1 = Reilly | first2 = Stephen | last2 = Kaufman | first3 = Angela | last3 = Bodino | year = 2003 | publisher = M.E.

[[Indigenous peoples]] have been –and are– often subject to racist attitudes. Practices and ideologies of racism are condemned by the [[United Nations]] in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly, ''Universal Declaration of Human Rights'', 10 December 1948, 217 A (III), available at: [https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/] [accessed 18 July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Europe was confronted with the new "[[nationalities]] question," leading to reconfigurations of the European map, on which the frontiers between the states had been delineated during the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. [[Nationalism]] had made its first appearance with the invention of the ''[[levée en masse]]'' by the [[French Revolution]]aries, thus inventing mass [[conscription]] in order to be able to defend the newly founded [[French First Republic|Republic]] against the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' order represented by the European monarchies. This led to the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] (1792–1802) and then to the conquests of [[Napoleon]], and to the subsequent European-wide debates on the concepts and realities of [[nation]]s, and in particular of [[nation-state]]s. The [[Westphalia Treaty]] had divided Europe into various empires and kingdoms ([[Ottoman Empire]], [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Swedish Empire]], [[France|Kingdom of France]], etc.), and for centuries wars were waged between princes (''[[Kabinettskriege]]'' in German).

Modern [[nation-state]]s appeared in the wake of the French Revolution, with the formation of [[patriotism|patriotic]] sentiments for the first time in [[Enlightenment Spain|Spain]] during the [[Peninsula War]] (1808–1813, known in Spain as the Independence War). Despite the restoration of the previous order with the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]], the "nationalities question" became the main problem of Europe during the [[Industrial Era]], leading in particular to the [[1848 Revolutions]], the [[Italian unification]] completed during the 1871 [[Franco-Prussian War]], which itself culminated in the proclamation of the [[German Empire]] in the Hall of Mirrors in the [[Palace of Versailles]], thus achieving the [[German unification]].

Meanwhile, the [[Ottoman Empire]], the "[[sick man of Europe]]", was confronted with endless nationalist movements, which, along with the dissolving of the [[Austrian-Hungarian Empire]], would lead to the creation after [[World War I]] of the various nation-states of the [[Balkan]]s, with "national [[minorities]]" in their borders.&lt;ref&gt;On this "[[nationalities]] question" and the problem of nationalism, see the relevant articles for a non-exhaustive account of the state of contemporary historical researches; famous works include: [[Ernest Gellner]], ''Nations and Nationalism'' (1983); [[Eric Hobsbawm]],''The Age of Revolution : Europe 1789–1848'' (1962), ''Nations and Nationalism since 1780 : programme, myth, reality'' (1990); [[Benedict Anderson]], ''[[Imagined Communities]]'' (1991); [[Charles Tilly]], ''Coercion, Capital and European States AD 990–1992'' (1990); [[Anthony D. Smith]], ''Theories of Nationalism'' (1971), etc.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ethnic nationalism]], which advocated the belief in a hereditary membership of the nation, made its appearance in the historical context surrounding the creation of the modern nation-states.

One of its main influences was the [[Romantic nationalist]] movement at the turn of the 19th century, represented by figures such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Johann Herder]] (1744–1803), [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Johan Fichte]] (1762–1814) in the ''Addresses to the German Nation'' (1808), [[Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831), or also, in France, [[Jules Michelet]] (1798–1874). It was opposed to [[liberal nationalism]], represented by authors such as [[Ernest Renan]] (1823–1892), who conceived of the nation as a community, which, instead of being based on the ''[[Volk]]'' ethnic group and on a specific, common language, was founded on the subjective will to live together ("the nation is a daily [[plebiscite]]", 1882) or also [[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873).&lt;ref&gt;[[John Stuart Mill]], ''Considerations on Representative Government'', 1861&lt;/ref&gt;
Ethnic nationalism blended with scientific racist discourses, as well as with "continental [[imperialist]]" ([[Hannah Arendt]], 1951&lt;ref name="Arendt"&gt;[[Hannah Arendt]], ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' (1951)&lt;/ref&gt;) discourses, for example in the [[pan-Germanism]] discourses, which postulated the racial superiority of the German ''[[Volk]]'' (people/folk). The [[Alldeutscher Verband|Pan-German League]] (''Alldeutscher Verband''), created in 1891, promoted [[German colonial empire|German imperialism]], "[[racial hygiene]]" and was opposed to intermarriage with [[Jews]]. Another popular current, the ''[[Völkisch movement]]'', was also an important proponent of the German ethnic nationalist discourse, and it combined Pan-Germanism with modern [[racial antisemitism]]. Members of the Völkisch movement, in particular the [[Thule Society]], would participate in the founding of the [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP) in Munich in 1918, the predecessor of the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP; commonly known in English as the Nazi party). Pan-Germanism played a decisive role in the [[interwar period]] of the 1920s–1930s.&lt;ref name=Arendt /&gt;

These currents began to associate the idea of the nation with the biological concept of a "[[master race]]" (often the "[[Aryan race]]" or the "[[Nordic race]]") issued from the scientific racist discourse. They conflated nationalities with ethnic groups, called "races", in a radical distinction from previous racial discourses that posited the existence of a "race struggle" inside the nation and the state itself. Furthermore, they believed that political boundaries should mirror these alleged racial and ethnic groups, thus justifying [[ethnic cleansing]] in order to achieve "racial purity" and also to achieve ethnic homogeneity in the nation-state.

Such racist discourses, combined with nationalism, were not, however, limited to pan-Germanism. In France, the transition from Republican, liberal nationalism, to ethnic nationalism, which made nationalism a characteristic of [[History of far-right movements in France|far-right movements in France]], took place during the [[Dreyfus Affair]] at the end of the 19th century. During several years, a nationwide crisis affected French society, concerning the alleged treason of [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a French Jewish military officer. The country polarized itself into two opposite camps, one represented by [[Émile Zola]], who wrote ''[[J'accuse]]'' in defense of Alfred Dreyfus, and the other represented by the nationalist poet, [[Maurice Barrès]] (1862–1923), one of the founders of the ethnic nationalist discourse in France.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Barrès]], ''Le Roman de l'énergie nationale'' (The Novel of National Energy, a trilogy started in 1897)&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[Charles Maurras]] (1868–1952), founder of the monarchist ''[[Action française]]'' movement, theorized the "anti-France," composed of the "four confederate states of Protestants, Jews, Freemasons and foreigners" (his actual word for the latter being the pejorative ''[[Metic|métèques]]''). Indeed, to him the first three were all "internal foreigners", who threatened the ethnic unity of the [[French people]].

[[Bernard Lewis]] has cited the [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] who, in his discussion of [[slavery]], stated that while [[Greeks]] are free by nature, '[[barbarian]]s' (non-Greeks) are slaves by nature, in that it is in their nature to be more willing to submit to [[Despotism|despotic]] government.&lt;ref name=Lewis /&gt; Though Aristotle does not specify any particular races, he argues that people from outside Greece are more prone to the burden of slavery than those from [[Ancient Greece|Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Bernard Lewis| authorlink = Bernard Lewis| title = Race and slavery in the Middle East: an historical enquiry| year = 1992| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-505326-5| pages = 54–55 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Aristotle makes remarks about the most natural slaves being those with strong bodies and slave souls (unfit for rule, unintelligent) which would seem to imply a physical basis for discrimination, he also explicitly states that the right kind of souls and bodies don't always go together, implying that the greatest determinate for inferiority and natural slaves versus natural masters is the soul, not the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/distance_arc/las_casas/Aristotle-slavery.html |title=Aristotle on Slavery |publisher=Oregonstate.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906070456/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/distance_arc/las_casas/Aristotle-slavery.html |archivedate=September 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This proto-racism is seen as an important precursor to modern racism by classicist [[Benjamin Isaac]].

Such proto-racism and ethnocentrism must be looked at within context, because a modern understanding of racism based on hereditary inferiority (modern racism based on: [[eugenics]] and scientific racism) was not yet developed and it is unclear whether Aristotle believed the natural inferiority of Barbarians was caused by environment and climate (like many of his contemporaries) or by birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jfylyRawl8EC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;dq=aristotle+racism#v=onepage&amp;q=aristotle%20racism&amp;f=false |title=The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity – Benjamin H.

Historian Dante A. Puzzo, in his discussion of Aristotle, racism, and the ancient world writes that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Racism rests on two basic assumptions: that a correlation exists between physical characteristics and moral qualities; that mankind is divisible into superior and inferior stocks. Racism, thus defined, is a modern conception, for prior to the XVIth century there was virtually nothing in the life and thought of the West that can be described as racist. To prevent misunderstanding a clear distinction must be made between racism and [[ethnocentrism]]&amp;nbsp;... The Ancient [[Hebrews]], in referring to all who were not Hebrews as [[Gentile]]s, were indulging in [[ethnocentrism]], not in racism.&amp;nbsp;... So it was with the [[Greeks|Hellenes]] who denominated all non-Hellenes—whether the wild [[Scythians]] or the [[Egyptians]] whom they acknowledged as their mentors in the arts of [[civilization]]—Barbarians, the term denoting that which was strange or foreign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Racism and the Western Tradition |first=Dante A. |last=Puzzo |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=25 |issue=4 |year=1964 |pages=579–586 |doi=10.2307/2708188 |jstor=2708188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...beyond [known peoples of black West Africa] to the south there is no civilization in the proper sense. There are only humans who are closer to dumb animals than to rational beings. They live in thickets and caves, and eat herbs and unprepared grain. They frequently eat each other. They cannot be considered human beings.

However, according to [[Wesleyan University]] professor Abdelmajid Hannoum, the view that Arab scholars and geographers from this time period held racist attitudes are the result of mistranslations, stating that such attitudes were not prevalent until the 18th and 19th centuries.

The legacy Catholic [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] then formulated the ''[[Cleanliness of blood]]'' doctrine. It was during this time in history that the Western concept of aristocratic "[[Nobility#"Blue" blood|blue blood]]" emerged in a racialized, religious and feudal context,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pachami.com/Inquisicion/LimpiezaSangre.html|title=Limpieza de Sangre|last=A. Chami|first=Pablo|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; so as to stem the upward social mobility of the converted [[Converso|New Christians]]. Robert Lacey explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was the Spaniards who gave the world the notion that an aristocrat's blood is not red but blue. The Spanish nobility started taking shape around the ninth century in classic military fashion, occupying land as warriors on horseback. They were to continue the process for more than five hundred years, clawing back sections of the peninsula from its Moorish occupiers, and a nobleman demonstrated his pedigree by holding up his sword arm to display the filigree of blue-blooded veins beneath his pale skin—proof that his birth had not been contaminated by the dark-skinned enemy. Sangre azul, blue blood, was thus a euphemism for being a [[white people|white]] man—Spain's own particular reminder that the refined footsteps of the aristocracy through history carry the rather less refined spoor of racism.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lacey, ''Aristocrats''. Little, Brown and Company, 1983, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the expulsion of the Arabic [[Moors]] and most of the [[Sephardic Jews]] from the [[Iberian peninsula]], the remaining [[Jews]] and [[Muslim]]s were forced to [[Converso|convert]] to Roman Catholicism, becoming "[[New Christian]]s", who were sometimes discriminated by the "[[Old Christian]]s" in some cities (e.g. [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]), despite condemnations by the Church and the State, who were welcoming the new flock.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Inquisition]] was carried out by members of the [[Dominican Order]] in order to weed out the converts that still practiced [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]] in secret. The system and ideology of the ''limpieza de sangre'' ostracized false Christian converts from society to protect it against treason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Los estatutos de Limpieza de Sangre|page=121|author=Sicroff, Albert A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remnants of such legislation persevered into the 19th century in military contexts.&lt;ref&gt;''Colección Legislativa de España'' (1870), p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Portugal]], the legal distinction between New and Old Christian was only ended through a legal decree issued by the [[Marquis of Pombal]] in 1772, almost three centuries after the implementation of the racist discrimination. The ''limpieza de sangre'' legislation was common also during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonization of the Americas]], where it led to the racial and feudal separation of peoples and social strata in the colonies. It was however often ignored in practice, as the new colonies needed skilled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Jewish diaspora: origins, experiences, and culture|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2009|isbn=1-85109-873-9|page=689|author=Avrum Ehrlich, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the [[Spanish Renaissance|Renaissance]], the [[Valladolid debate]] (1550–1551) concerning the treatment of [[Indigenous people of the Americas|natives]] of the "[[New World]]" opposed the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar and Bishop of Chiapas [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]] to another Dominican and Humanist [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda]]. The latter argued that the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] practiced [[human sacrifice]] of innocents, [[cannibalism]], and other such "crimes against nature" were unacceptable and should be suppressed by any means possible including war,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tratado sobre las Justas Causas de la Guerra contra los Indios|publisher=Fondo de Cultura Económica|year=1941|location=Mexico D.F.|pages=155|author=Ginés de Sepúlveda, Juan (trans.

To the contrary, Bartolomé de Las Casas argued that the Amerindians were free men in the natural order and deserved the same treatment as others, according to [[Catholic theology]]. It was one of the many controversies concerning racism, slavery, religion, and European morality that would arise in the following centuries and which resulted in the legislation protecting the natives.&lt;ref name="Hernandez"&gt;{{cite journal|year= |title=The Las Casas-Sepúlveda Controversy: 1550–1551 |url=http://userwww.sfsu.edu/~epf/journal_archive/volume_X,_2001/hernandez_b.pdf |journal=Ex Post Facto |publisher=[[San Francisco State University]] |volume=10 |issue= |pages=95–104 |doi= |pmc= |pmid= |author=Bonar Ludwig Hernandez |date=2001 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421063702/http://userwww.sfsu.edu/epf/journal_archive/volume_X%2C_2001/hernandez_b.pdf |archivedate=21 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[antisemitism]] has a long history, related to [[Christianity]] and e.g. [[Ancient Egyptian religion|native Egyptian]] or [[Ancient Greek religion|Greek religions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Anguish of the Jews: Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism|last=Flannery|first=Edward|date=2004-11-02|publisher=Paulist Press|isbn=9780809143245|edition=2nd|location=New York|language=English|asin = 0809143240}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[anti-Judaism]]), racism itself is sometimes described as a ''modern'' phenomenon. In the view of the French philosopher and historian [[Michel Foucault]], the first formulation of racism emerged in the [[Early modern Europe|Early Modern period]] as the "[[discourse]] of race struggle", a historical and political discourse, which Foucault opposed to the philosophical and juridical discourse of [[sovereignty]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, ''Society Must Be Defended'' (1976–77)&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, e.g. Chinese self-identification as a "yellow race" predated such European racial concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/10955/Race-Racism-in-Asia-Race-Racism-in-China.html|title=Race and Racism in Asia – Race And Racism in China|last=|first=|date=|website=science.jrank.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-01|quote=Chinese descriptions of themselves as a "yellow" race predated European use of such terms.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This European analysis, which first appeared in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], was then carried on in France by people such as [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]], [[Nicolas Fréret]], and then, during the 1789 [[French Revolution]], [[Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès|Sieyès]], and afterward [[Augustin Thierry]] and [[Antoine Augustin Cournot|Cournot]]. Boulainvilliers, who created the matrix of such racist discourse in medieval France, conceived of the "race" as being something closer to the sense of a "nation", that is, in his time, the "race" meant the "people".

He conceived of France as being divided between various nations—the unified [[nation-state]] is, of course, here an [[anachronism]]—which themselves formed different "races". Boulainvilliers opposed the [[absolute monarchy]], which tried to bypass the [[aristocracy]] by establishing a direct relationship to the [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]]. Thus, he developed the theory that the French aristocrats were the descendants of foreign invaders, whom he called the "[[Franks]]", while according to him, the Third Estate constituted the autochthonous, vanquished [[Gallo-Romans]], who were dominated by the Frankish aristocracy as a consequence of the [[right of conquest]]. Early modern racism was opposed to nationalism and the nation-state: the [[François Dominique de Reynaud de Montlosier|Comte de Montlosier]], in exile during the [[French Revolution]], who borrowed Boulainvilliers' discourse on the "Nordic race" as being the French aristocracy that invaded the plebeian "Gauls", thus showed his contempt for the Third Estate, calling it "this new people born of slaves&amp;nbsp;... [[miscegenation|mixture of all races and of all times]]".

While 19th century racism became closely intertwined with nationalism,&lt;ref&gt;Academic Press (2000). [https://books.google.com/books?id=pvHRNNk9hHEC&amp;pg=PA435&amp;dq=racism+and+ethnic+nationalism+in+the+19th+century,&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=B8DTUt2WK8qShQeKuICYDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=racism%20and%20ethnic%20nationalism%20in%20the%2019th%20century%2C&amp;f=false/ " Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Two-Volume Set, Volume 2"].&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the [[ethnic nationalist]] discourse that identified the "race" with the "[[Volk (German word)|folk]]", leading to such movements as [[pan-Germanism]], [[pan-Turkism]], [[pan-Arabism]], and [[pan-Slavism]], medieval racism precisely divided the nation into various non-biological "races", which were thought to be the consequence of historical conquests and [[social conflict]]s. Michel Foucault traced the genealogy of modern racism to this medieval "historical and political discourse of race struggle". According to him, it divided itself in the 19th century according to two rival lines: on one hand, it was incorporated by racists, biologists and [[eugenicists]], who gave it the modern sense of "race" and, even more, transformed this popular discourse into a "[[state racism]]" (e.g., Nazism). On the other hand, [[Marxists|Marxism]] also seized this discourse founded on the assumption of a political struggle that provided the real [[philosophy of history|engine of history]] and continued to act underneath the apparent peace. Thus, Marxists transformed the [[essentialist]] notion of "race" into the historical notion of "[[class struggle]]", defined by socially structured positions: capitalist or proletarian. In ''[[The Will to Knowledge]]'' (1976), Foucault analyzed another opponent of the "race struggle" discourse: [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]], which opposed the concept of "blood [[heredity]]", prevalent in the 19th century racist discourse.

Authors such as [[Hannah Arendt]], in her 1951 book ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', have said that the racist ideology (''popular racism'') which developed at the end of the 19th century helped legitimize the [[New Imperialism|imperialist conquests]] of foreign territories and the atrocities that sometimes accompanied them (such as the [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide]] of 1904–1907 or the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915–1917). [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem ''[[The White Man's Burden]]'' (1899) is one of the more famous illustrations of the belief in the inherent superiority of the [[Western culture|European culture]] over the rest of the world, though it is also thought to be a satirical appraisal of such imperialism. Racist ideology thus helped legitimize the conquest and incorporation of foreign territories into an empire, which were regarded as a humanitarian obligation partially as a result of these racist beliefs.

Thus, when the [[Saartjie Baartman|Hottentot Venus]] was displayed in England in the beginning of the 19th century, the African Association publicly opposed itself to the exhibition. The same year that Kipling published his poem, [[Joseph Conrad]] published ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899), a clear criticism of the [[Congo Free State]] owned by [[Leopold II of Belgium]].

Examples of racial theories used include the creation of the [[Hamitic]] [[ethno-linguistic]] group during the [[European exploration of Africa]]. It was then restricted by [[Karl Friedrich Lepsius]] (1810–1877) to non-[[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[Afro-Asiatic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Merriam Webster (editor), ''Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'', 10 Rev Ed edition, (Merriam-Webster: 1998), p. 563&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Hamite'' was applied to different populations within North Africa, mainly comprising [[Ethiopia]]ns, [[Demographics of Eritrea|Eritreans]], [[Somali people|Somalis]], [[Berber people|Berbers]], and the [[Egyptians|ancient Egyptians]]. Hamites were regarded as Caucasoid peoples who probably originated in either [[Arabia]] or [[Middle East|Asia]] on the basis of their cultural, physical and linguistic similarities with the peoples of those areas.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald James Harrison, ''Africa and the Islands'', (Wiley: 1965), p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Dodge, ''African Politics in Perspective'', (Van Nostrand: 1966), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Senior, ''Tropical Lands: a human geography'', (Longman: 1979), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Europeans considered Hamites to be more civilized than [[Black people|Sub-Saharan Africans]], and more akin to themselves and [[Semitic peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;A. H. M. Jones, Elizabeth Monroe, ''History of Abyssinia'', (Kessinger Publishing: 2003), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; In the first two-thirds of the 20th century, the Hamitic race was, in fact, considered one of the branches of the [[Caucasian race]], along with the [[Aryan race|Indo-Europeans]], [[Semitic people|Semites]], and the [[Mediterranean race]].

However, the Hamitic peoples themselves were often deemed to have failed as rulers, which was usually ascribed to [[miscegenation|interbreeding]] with Negroes. In the mid-20th century, the German scholar [[Carl Meinhof]] (1857–1944) claimed that the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] race was formed by a merger of [[Hamitic]] and [[Negroid|Negro]] races. The Hottentots ([[Nama people|Nama]] or [[Khoi]]) were formed by the merger of Hamitic and [[Bushmen]] (San) races—both being termed nowadays as [[Khoisan]] peoples.

Duke University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Racism spread throughout the New World in the late 19th century and early 20th century. [[Whitecapping]], which started in Indiana in the late 19th century, soon spread throughout all of North America, causing many African laborers to flee from the land they worked on. In the US during the 1860s, racist posters were used during election campaigns. In one of these racist posters (see above), a black man is depicted lounging idly in the foreground as one white man ploughs his field and another chops wood. Accompanying labels are: "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread," and "The white man must work to keep his children and pay his taxes." The black man wonders, "Whar is de use for me to work as long as dey make dese appropriations." Above in a cloud is an image of the "Freedman's Bureau! Negro Estimate of Freedom!" The bureau is pictured as a large domed building resembling the U.S. Capitol and is inscribed "Freedom and No Work." Its columns and walls are labeled, "Candy," "Rum, Gin, Whiskey," "Sugar Plums," "Indolence," "White Women," "Apathy," "White Sugar," "Idleness," and so on.

On June 5, 1873, Sir [[Francis Galton]], distinguished English explorer and cousin of Charles Darwin, wrote in a letter to ''[[The Times]]'':

The racial ideology conceived by the Nazis graded humans on a scale of pure Aryan to non-Aryan, with the latter viewed as subhuman.

One form of racism in the United States was enforced [[racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] which existed until the 1960s when it was outlawed in the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. It has been argued that this separation of races continues to exist ''de facto'' today .

Scottish philosopher and economist [[David Hume]] said, "I am apt to suspect the Negroes to be naturally inferior to the Whites. There scarcely ever was a civilised nation of that complexion, nor even any individual, eminent either in action or in speculation. No ingenious manufacture among them, no arts, no sciences."&lt;ref name="EricMorton"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.africanphilosophy.com/vol1.1/morton.html |title=Race nad Racism in the works of David Hume |author=Eric Morton |authorlink= Eric Morton |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090827004736/http://www.africanphilosophy.com/vol1.1/morton.html|archivedate=August 27, 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] stated: "The yellow Indians do have a meagre talent.

(Oxford Readings in Philosophy) (Paperback) by [[Bernard Boxill]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, the German philosopher, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], declared that "Africa is no historical part of the world." Hegel further claimed that blacks had no "sense of personality; their spirit sleeps, remains sunk in itself, makes no advance, and thus parallels the compact, undifferentiated mass of the African continent."&lt;ref&gt;''On Blackness Without Blacks: Essays on the Image of the Black in Germany'', Boston: C.W. Hall, 1982, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

While opposed to slavery in the U.S, in 1858 President [[Abraham Lincoln]] stated, "I am not, nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races, that I am not, nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people. I as much as any man am in favor of the superior position assigned to the white race".&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Lincoln, "Speeches and Writings 1832–1858: Speeches, Letters, and Miscellaneous Writings : the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, Volume 1". p. 638. Library of America, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrian philosopher [[Otto Weininger]], claimed: "A genius has perhaps scarcely ever appeared amongst the negroes, and the standard of their morality is almost universally so low that it is beginning to be acknowledged in America that their emancipation was an act of imprudence."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sex and Character]]'', New York: G.P. Putnam, 1906, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German conservative, [[Oswald Spengler]], remarked on what he perceived as the culturally degrading influence of Africans in modern Western culture: in ''The Hour of Decision'' Spengler denounced "the 'happy ending' of an empty existence, the boredom of which has brought to jazz music and Negro dancing to perform the Death March for a great Culture."&lt;ref&gt;''The Hour of Decision'', pp. 227–28&lt;/ref&gt; During the Nazi era, German scientists rearranged academia to support claims of a grand "Aryan" agent behind the splendors of all human civilizations, including India and Ancient Egypt.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Scientific variants===
{{Further information|Unilineal evolution}}
The modern biological definition of race developed in the 19th century with scientific racist theories. The term ''scientific racism'' refers to the use of science to justify and support racist beliefs, which goes back to the early 18th century, though it gained most of its influence in the mid-19th century, during the [[New Imperialism]] period. Also known as academic racism, such theories first needed to overcome the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]]'s resistance to [[positivism|positivist]] accounts of history and its support of [[monogenism]], the concept that all human beings were originated from the same ancestors, in accordance with [[creationist]] accounts of history.

These racist theories put forth on scientific hypothesis were combined with [[unilineal evolution|unilineal theories of social progress]], which postulated the superiority of the European civilization over the rest of the world. Furthermore, they frequently made use of the idea of "[[survival of the fittest]]", a term coined by [[Herbert Spencer]] in 1864, associated with ideas of competition, which were named [[social Darwinism]] in the 1940s. [[Charles Darwin]] himself opposed the idea of rigid racial differences in ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' (1871) in which he argued that humans were all of one species, sharing common descent. He recognised racial differences as varieties of humanity, and emphasised the close similarities between people of all races in mental faculties, tastes, dispositions and habits, while still contrasting the culture of the "lowest savages" with European civilization.&lt;ref name="dom"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=245 |title=The descent of man, and selection in relation to sex |accessdate=2007-12-02 |author=Charles Darwin |authorlink=Charles Darwin|year=1871 |publisher=John Murray|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014528/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=245 |archivedate = September 30, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Desmond| first = Adrian| author2 = James Richard Moore| title = Darwin| year = 1991| publisher = Michael Joseph, Penguin Group| isbn = 978-0-7181-3430-3| oclc = 185764721 }} pp. 28, 147, 580.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 19th century, proponents of scientific racism intertwined themselves with [[eugenics]] discourses of "[[degeneration]] of the race" and "blood [[heredity]]."{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Henceforth, scientific racist discourses could be defined as the combination of polygenism, unilinealism, social Darwinism and eugenism. They found their scientific legitimacy on [[physical anthropology]], [[anthropometry]], [[craniometry]], [[phrenology]], [[physiognomy]], and others now discredited disciplines in order to formulate racist prejudices.

Before being disqualified in the 20th century by the American school of [[cultural anthropology]] ([[Franz Boas]], etc.), the British school of [[social anthropology]] ([[Bronisław Malinowski]], [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]], etc.), the French school of [[ethnology]] ([[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], etc.), as well as the discovery of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|neo-Darwinian synthesis]], such sciences, in particular anthropometry, were used to deduce behaviours and psychological characteristics from outward, physical appearances.

The neo-Darwinian synthesis, first developed in the 1930s, eventually led to a [[gene-centered view of evolution]] in the 1960s. According to the [[Human Genome Project]], the most complete mapping of human DNA to date indicates that there is no clear [[Race and genetics|genetic basis to racial groups]]. While some genes are more common in certain populations, there are no genes that exist in all members of one population and no members of any other.&lt;ref name="ornl"&gt;{{cite web | title = Minorities, Race, and Genomics| url = http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/minorities.shtml | accessdate = 2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heredity and eugenics====
{{Further information|Eugenics}}
The first theory of [[eugenics]] was developed in 1869 by [[Francis Galton]] (1822–1911), who used the then popular concept of ''[[degeneration]]''. He applied [[statistics]] to study human differences and the alleged "[[inheritance of intelligence]]", foreshadowing future uses of "[[intelligence testing]]" by the anthropometry school. Such theories were vividly described by the writer [[Émile Zola]] (1840–1902), who started publishing in 1871 a twenty-novel cycle, ''[[Les Rougon-Macquart]]'', where he linked [[heredity]] to behavior. Thus, Zola described the high-born Rougons as those involved in politics (''[[Son Excellence Eugène Rougon]]'') and medicine (''[[Le Docteur Pascal]]'') and the low-born Macquarts as those fatally falling into [[alcoholism]] (''[[L'Assommoir]]''), [[prostitution]] (''[[Nana (novel)|Nana]]''), and [[homicide]] (''[[La Bête humaine]]'').

During the rise of [[Nazi Germany|Nazism in Germany]], some scientists in Western nations worked to debunk the regime's racial theories. A few argued against racist ideologies and discrimination, even if they believed in the alleged existence of biological races. However, in the fields of anthropology and biology, these were minority positions until the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[UNESCO]], ''[[The Race Question]]'', 1950&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 1950 UNESCO statement, ''[[The Race Question]]'', an international project to debunk racist theories had been attempted in the mid-1930s. However, this project had been abandoned. Thus, in 1950, UNESCO declared that it had resumed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...up again, after a lapse of fifteen years, a project that the [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]] has wished to carry through but that it had to abandon in deference to the [[Appeasement of Hitler|appeasement policy]] of the pre-war period. The race question had become one of the pivots of [[Nazi ideology]] and policy. [[Tomáš Masaryk|Masaryk]] and [[Edvard Beneš|Beneš]] took the initiative of calling for a conference to re-establish in the minds and consciences of men everywhere the truth about race&amp;nbsp;... Nazi propaganda was able to continue its baleful work unopposed by the authority of an international organisation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Third Reich's racial policies]], its [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics programs]] and the extermination of Jews in [[the Holocaust]], as well as [[Romani people]] in the [[Porrajmos]] (the [[Porajmos|Romani Holocaust]]) and others minorities led to a change in opinions about scientific research into race after the war.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Changes within scientific disciplines, such as the rise of the [[Franz Boas|Boasian]] school of anthropology in the United States contributed to this shift. These theories were strongly denounced in the 1950 UNESCO statement, signed by internationally renowned scholars, and titled ''[[The Race Question]]''.

====Polygenism and racial typologies====
{{Further information|Polygenism |Typology (anthropology)}}
[[File:Passing of the Great Race - Map 4.jpg|right|thumb|Madison Grant's map, from 1916, charting the "present distribution of European races", with the [[Nordic race|Nordics]] in red, the [[Alpine race|Alpines]] in green, and the [[Mediterranean race|Mediterraneans]] in yellow.]]
Works such as [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853–1855) may be considered as one of the first theorizations of this new racism, founded on an essentialist notion of race, which opposed the former racial discourse, of [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]] for example, which saw in races a fundamentally historical reality, which changed over time. Gobineau, thus, attempted to frame racism within the terms of biological differences among humans, giving it the legitimacy of [[biology]].

Gobineau's theories would be expanded, in France, by [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] (1854–1936)'s [[typology (anthropology)|typology of races]], who published in 1899 ''The Aryan and his Social Role'', in which he claimed that the white, "[[Aryan]] race", "[[Cephalic index|dolichocephalic]]", was opposed to the "brachycephalic" race, of whom the "[[Jew]]" was the archetype. Vacher de Lapouge thus created a hierarchical classification of races, in which he identified the "''[[Nordic race|Homo europaeus]]'' (Teutonic, Protestant, etc.), the "''[[Homo alpinus]]''" ([[Auvergne (province)|Auvergnat]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]], etc.), and finally the "''[[Homo mediterraneus]]''" ([[Naples|Neapolitan]], [[Andalusia|Andalus]], etc.) He assimilated races and [[social class]]es, considering that the French upper class was a representation of the ''Homo europaeus'', while the lower class represented the ''Homo alpinus''. Applying Galton's eugenics to his theory of races, Vacher de Lapouge's "selectionism" aimed first at achieving the annihilation of [[trade union]]ists, considered to be a "degenerate"; second, creating types of man each destined to one end, in order to prevent any contestation of [[labour condition]]s. His "anthroposociology" thus aimed at blocking [[social conflict]] by establishing a fixed, hierarchical social order.&lt;ref&gt;Matsuo Takeshi ([[Shimane Prefecture|University of Shimane]], Japan). ''L'Anthropologie de Georges Vacher de Lapouge: Race, classe et eugénisme'' (Georges Vacher de Lapouge anthropology) in ''[[Études de langue et littérature françaises]]'' 2001, n°79, pp. 47–57. {{ISSN|0425-4929}}; [[INIST]]-[[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]], Cote INIST : 25320, 35400010021625.0050 ([http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=13473405 Abstract resume on the INIST-CNRS])&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, [[William Z. Ripley]] used identical racial classification in ''[[The Races of Europe (Ripley)|The Races of Europe]]'' (1899), which would have a great influence in the United States. Other scientific authors include [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain|H.S. Chamberlain]] at the end of the 19th century (a British citizen who [[naturalization|naturalized]] himself as German because of his admiration for the "Aryan race") and [[Madison Grant]], a eugenicist and author of ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' (1916). Madison Grant provided statistics for the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], which severely restricted immigration of Jews, [[Slavs]], and southern Europeans, who were subsequently hindered in seeking to escape Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The funding of scientific racism: Wickliffe Draper and the Pioneer Fund |last=Tucker |first=William H. |authorlink=William H.

====Human zoos====
[[File:Humanzoogermany.jpg|upright|thumb|A [[human zoo]] (''Völkerschau'', "People Show") in [[Stuttgart]] (Germany) in 1928]] [[Human zoo]]s (called "People Shows"), were an important means of bolstering ''popular racism'' by connecting it to scientific racism: they were both objects of public curiosity and of [[anthropology]] and [[anthropometry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/979954/ On A Neglected Aspect Of Western Racism], Kurt Jonassohn, December 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Human zoos – Racist theme parks for Europe's colonialists |work=[[Le Monde diplomatique]] |date = August 2000|url=http://mondediplo.com/2000/08/07humanzoo |author1=Pascal Blanchard, Sandrine Lemaire  |author2=Nicolas Bancel |lastauthoramp=yes }} ; {{cite news |title=Ces zoos humains de la République coloniale |work=[[Le Monde diplomatique]]  |date=August 2000|url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2000/08/BANCEL/14145.html|language=fr}} (available to everyone)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joice Heth]], an African American slave, was displayed by [[Phineas Taylor Barnum|P.T. Barnum]] in 1836, a few years after the exhibition of [[Saartjie Baartman]], the "Hottentot Venus", in England.

[[Carl Hagenbeck]], inventor of the modern zoos, exhibited animals beside humans who were considered "savages".&lt;ref name="Diplo"&gt;[http://mondediplo.com/2000/08/07humanzoo Human Zoos], by Nicolas Bancel, Pascal Blanchard and Sandrine Lemaire, in ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', August 2000 [http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2000/08/BANCEL/14145.html French – free]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120629100243/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1252/is_16_131/ai_n13463375 Savages and Beasts – The Birth of the Modern Zoo], Nigel Rothfels, Johns Hopkins University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Congolese [[Pygmies|pygmy]] [[Ota Benga]] was displayed in 1906 by [[eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]], head of the [[Bronx Zoo]], as an attempt to illustrate the "missing link" between humans and [[orangutan]]s: thus, racism was tied to [[Darwinism]], creating a [[social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] ideology that tried to ground itself in [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s scientific discoveries.

==Theories about the origins of racism==
{{See also|Ethnocentrism|Tribalism}}
[[File:Model of ethnic &amp; ratial conflict.png|thumbnail|Sociological model of ethnic and racial conflict.]]
Evolutionary psychologists [[John Tooby]] and [[Leda Cosmides]] were puzzled by the fact that in the US race is one of the three characteristics most often used in brief descriptions of individuals (the others are age and sex). They reasoned that [[natural selection]] would not have favoured the evolution of an instinct for using race as a classification, because for most of human history, humans almost never encountered members of other races. Tooby and Cosmides hypothesized that modern people use race as a proxy (rough-and-ready indicator) for coalition membership, since a better-than-random guess about "which side" another person is on will be helpful if one does not actually know in advance.

Their colleague [[Robert Kurzban]] designed an experiment whose results appeared to support this hypothesis. Using the [[Memory confusion protocol]], they presented subjects with pictures of individuals and sentences, allegedly spoken by these individuals, which presented two sides of a debate. The errors that the subjects made in recalling who said what indicated that they sometimes misattributed a statement to a speaker of the same race as the "correct" speaker, although they also sometimes misattributed a statement to a speaker "on the same side" as the "correct" speaker. In a second run of the experiment, the team also distinguished the "sides" in the debate by clothing of similar colors; and in this case the effect of racial similarity in causing mistakes almost vanished, being replaced by the color of their clothing. In other words, the first group of subjects, with no clues from clothing, used race as a visual guide to guessing who was on which side of the debate; the second group of subjects used the clothing color as their main visual clue, and the effect of race became very small.&lt;ref name="KurzbanToobyCosmides2001ErasingRace"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Can race be erased?

Some research suggests that ethnocentric thinking may have actually contributed to the development of cooperation. Political scientists Ross Hammond and Robert Axelrod created a computer simulation wherein virtual individuals were randomly assigned one of a variety of skin colors, and then one of a variety of trading strategies: be color-blind, favor those of your own color, or favor those of other colors. They found that the ethnocentric individuals clustered together, then grew until all the non-ethnocentric individuals were wiped out.&lt;ref&gt;New Scientist. Issue 2595, 17 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] writes that "Blood-feuds and inter-clan warfare are easily interpretable in terms of [[W. D. Hamilton|Hamilton]]'s [[kin selection|genetic theory]]." Dawkins writes that racial prejudice, while not evolutionarily adaptive, "could be interpreted as an irrational generalization of a kin-selected tendency to identify with individuals physically resembling oneself, and to be nasty to individuals different in appearance".&lt;ref name="Dawkins2006"&gt;{{cite book| author = Richard Dawkins| title = The selfish gene| url = https://books.google.com/?id=EJeHTt8hW7UC&amp;pg=PA99| year = 2006| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-929115-1| page = 99 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simulation-based experiments in [[evolutionary game theory]] have attempted to provide an explanation for the selection of ethnocentric-strategy phenotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0022002706293470| pmc = | pmid =   | last1 = Hammond | first1 = R.

Despite support for evolutionary theories relating to an innate origin of racism, various studies have suggested racism is associated with lower intelligence and less diverse peer groups during childhood.  A neuroimaging study on amygdala activity during racial matching activities found increased activity to be associated with adolescent age as well as less racially diverse peer groups which the author conclude suggest an learned aspect of racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Telzer|first1=Eva|last2=Humphreys|first2=Kathryn|last3=Mor|first3=Shapiro|last4=Tottenham|first4=Nim|title=Amygdala Sensitivity to Race Is Not Present in Childhood but Emerges over Adolescence|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=25|issue=2|pages=234–44|doi=10.1162/jocn_a_00311|pmid=23066731|year=2013|pmc=3628780}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta analysis of neuroimaging studies found amygdala activity correlated to increased scores on implicit measures of racial bias.

[[State racism]]—that is, the institutions and practices of a nation-state that are grounded in racist ideology—has played a major role in all instances of [[settler colonialism]], from the [[United States]] to [[Australia]]. It also played a prominent role in the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] regime, in [[Fascism|fascist]] regimes throughout [[Europe]], and during the early years of Japan's [[Shōwa period]]. These governments advocated and implemented ideologies and policies that were racist, xenophobic and, in the case of [[Nazism]], genocidal.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Russel of Liverpool, ''The Knights of Bushido'', 2002, p. 238, [[Herbert Bix]], ''[[Hirohito and the making of modern Japan]]'', 2001, pp. 313–14, 326, 359–60; [[Karel van Wolferen]], ''[[The Enigma of Japanese power]]'', 1989, pp.&amp;nbsp;263–72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paulino|first1=Edward|title=Anti-Haitianism, Historical Memory, and the Potential for Genocidal Violence in the Dominican Republic|journal=Genocide Studies International|date=December 2006|volume=1|issue=3|pages=265|doi=10.3138/7864-3362-3R24-6231|publisher=University of Toronto Press|issn=2291-1847|eissn=2291-1855}}&lt;/ref&gt; The politics of Zimbabwe promote discrimination against whites, in an effort to ethnically cleanse the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/africa/03/30/zimbabwe.farmers/index.html |title=Tale of two farms in Zimbabwe – March 30, 2005 |publisher=CNN |date=2005-03-30 |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg Race Laws]] of 1935 prohibited sexual relations between any Aryan and Jew, considering it ''[[Rassenschande]]'', "racial pollution". The Nuremberg Laws stripped all Jews, even quarter- and half-Jews (second and first degree ''Mischlings''), of their German citizenship. This meant that they had no basic citizens' rights, e.g., [[the right to vote]]. In 1936, Jews were banned from all professional jobs, effectively preventing them from having any influence in education, politics, higher education and industry. On 15 November 1938, Jewish children were banned from going to normal schools. By April 1939, nearly all Jewish companies had either collapsed under financial pressure and declining profits, or had been persuaded to sell out to the Nazi government. This further reduced their rights as human beings; they were in many ways officially separated from the German populace. Similar laws existed in [[Bulgaria]] – [[Law for protection of the nation|The Law for protection of the nation]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], and [[Austria]].

Legislative state racism is known to have been enforced by the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] of [[South Africa]] during its [[Apartheid]] regime between 1948 and 1994. Here a series of [[Apartheid legislation in South Africa|Apartheid legislation]] was passed through the legal systems to make it legal for white South Africans to have rights which were superior to those of non-white South Africans. Non-white South Africans were not allowed involvement in any governing matters, including voting; access to quality healthcare; the provision of basic services, including clean water; electricity; as well as access to adequate schooling. Non-white South Africans were also prevented from accessing certain public areas, from using certain public transportation and were required to live only in certain designated areas. Non-white South Africans were taxed differently than white South Africans and they were also required to carry on them at all times additional documentation, which later became known as "dom passes", to certify their non-white South African citizenship. All of these legislative racial laws were abolished through a series of equal [[human rights]] laws which were passed at the end of the [[Apartheid]] era in the early 1990s.

==Anti-racism==

Anti-racism includes beliefs, actions, movements, and policies which are adopted or developed in order to oppose racism. In general, it promotes an egalitarian society in which people are not discriminated against on the basis of race. Movements such as the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] were examples of anti-racist movements. [[Nonviolent resistance]] is sometimes embraced as an element of anti-racist movements, although this was not always the case. [[Hate crime]] laws, [[affirmative action]], and bans on racist speech are also examples of government policy which is intended to suppress racism.

===International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination===
[[UNESCO]] marks March 21 as the yearly [[International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]], in memory of the events that occurred on March 21, 1960 in [[Sharpeville massacre|Sharpeville]], [[South Africa]], where police killed demonstrators protesting against the [[apartheid]] regime.

===Teaching about racism===
The [[Museum of Tolerance]] offers children and adults an opportunity to interact with authentic artifacts from the [[Holocaust]].
[[The Southern Poverty Law Center]] disseminates materials to teachers to help them educate their students about the causes and effects of racism.
