'''Racism''' is [[discrimination]] and [[prejudice]] against people based on their [[Race (human categorization)|race]] or [[ethnicity]]. Racism can be present in social actions, practices, or political systems (e.g. [[apartheid]]) that support the expression of prejudice or aversion in discriminatory practices. The ideology underlying racist practices often assumes that humans can be subdivided into distinct groups that are different in their social behavior and innate capacities and that can be ranked as inferior or superior. Racist ideology can become manifest in many aspects of social life. Associated social actions may include [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]], [[xenophobia]], [[Other (philosophy)|otherness]], [[Racial segregation|segregation]], [[Hierarchy|hierarchical ranking]], [[supremacism]], and related social phenomena. Racism refers to violation of [[racial equality]] based on equal opportunities ([[Equal opportunity|formal equality]]) or based on [[equality of outcome]]s for different races or ethnicities, also called [[substantive equality]].&lt;ref name="EU"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1358229120927947 |doi=10.1177/1358229120927947 |title=The European Court of Justice and the march towards substantive equality in European Union anti-discrimination law |date=2020 |last1=De Vos |first1=Marc |journal=[[International Journal of Discrimination and the Law]] |volume=20 |pages=62–87 |issn=1358-2291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the concepts of race and ethnicity are considered to be separate in contemporary [[social science]], the two terms have a long history of equivalence in popular usage and older social science literature. "Ethnicity" is often used in a sense close to one traditionally attributed to "race", the division of human groups based on qualities assumed to be essential or innate to the group (e.g. shared [[ancestry]] or shared behavior). ''Racism'' and ''[[racial discrimination]]'' are often used to describe discrimination on an ethnic or cultural basis, independent of whether these differences are described as racial. According to the [[United Nations]]'s [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]], there is no distinction between the terms "racial" and "ethnic" discrimination. It further concludes that superiority based on racial differentiation is [[scientifically false]], morally condemnable, socially [[unjust]], and dangerous. The convention also declared that there is no justification for racial discrimination, anywhere, in theory or in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-convention-elimination-all-forms-racial |title=International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination |publisher=[[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] |date=21 December 1965 |access-date=23 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240702232413/https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-convention-elimination-all-forms-racial |archive-date=2 July 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology, definition, and usage ==
{{Race}}
[[File:ProceedingsLakeMohonkConference.png|thumb|left|An early use of the word ''racism'' by [[Richard Henry Pratt]] in 1902: "Association of races and classes is necessary to destroy racism and [[classism]]."]]
In the 19th century, many scientists subscribed to the belief that the human population can be divided into races. The term ''racism'' is a noun describing the state of being racist, i.e., subscribing to the belief that the human population can or should be classified into races with differential abilities and dispositions, which in turn may motivate a political ideology in which rights and privileges are differentially distributed based on racial categories. The term "racist" may be an adjective or a noun, the latter describing a person who holds those beliefs.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"&gt;{{cite book |title=Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary |date=1983 |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc. |isbn=0-87779-508-8 |pages=969}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the root word "race" is not clear. Linguists generally agree that it came to the English language from [[Middle French]], but there is no such agreement on how it generally came into Latin-based languages. A recent proposal is that it derives from the Arabic ''ra's'', which means "head, beginning, origin" or the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''rosh'', which has a similar meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=race&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |title=race (n2) |dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=21 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240404005057/https://www.etymonline.com/word/race |archive-date=4 April 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early race theorists generally held the view that some races were inferior to others and they consequently believed that the differential treatment of races was fully justified.&lt;ref name="Garner09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Canadian Encyclo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/racism/ |title=Racism |website=The Canadian Encyclopedia |access-date=21 February 2016 |year=2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608204710/https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/racism |archive-date=8 June 2019 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources:

An entry in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2008) defines [[racialism]] as "[a]n earlier term than racism, but now largely superseded by it", and cites the term "racialism" in a 1902 quote.&lt;ref&gt;"racialism, n." [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/157084 OED Online]. September 2013. Oxford University Press. (Accessed 3 December 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; The revised ''Oxford English Dictionary'' cites the shorter term "racism" in a quote from the year 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/157097 "racism, n."]. ''OED Online''. September 2013. Oxford University Press. Accessed 3 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It was defined by the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (2nd edition 1989) as "[t]he theory that distinctive human characteristics and abilities are determined by race"; the same dictionary termed ''racism'' a [[synonym]] of ''racialism'': "belief in the superiority of a particular race". By the end of [[World War II]], ''racism'' had acquired the same supremacist connotations formerly associated with ''racialism'': ''racism'' by then implied racial [[discrimination]], racial [[supremacism]], and a harmful intent. The term "race hatred" had also been used by sociologist [[Frederick Hertz]] in the late 1920s.

As its history indicates, the popular use of the word ''racism'' is relatively recent. The word came into widespread usage in the [[Western world]] in the 1930s, when it was used to describe the social and political ideology of [[Nazism]], which treated "race" as a naturally given political unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7243.html |title=Racism: A Short History |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |author-link=George M.

They also argue that different forms of racism have characterized different historical periods and geographical areas.&lt;ref name="Bethen14"&gt;{{cite book |title=Racisms: From the Crusades to the Twentieth Century |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |last=Bethencourt |first=Francisco |year=2014 |location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garner (2009: p.&amp;nbsp;11) summarizes different existing definitions of racism and identifies three common elements contained in those definitions of racism. First, a historical, hierarchical [[Power (social and political)|power]] relationship between groups; second, a set of ideas (an ideology) about racial differences; and, third, discriminatory actions (practices).&lt;ref name="Garner09" /&gt;

=== Legal ===
Though many countries around the globe have passed [[law]]s related to race and discrimination, the first significant international [[human rights]] instrument developed by the United Nations (UN) was the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR),&lt;ref name="UNUDHR"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html |title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights |date=6 October 2015 |publisher=[[United Nations]] |access-date=22 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031224448/http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html |archive-date=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1948. The UDHR recognizes that if people are to be treated with dignity, they require [[economic rights]], [[civil rights|social rights]] including education, and the rights to [[culture|cultural]] and political participation and [[Civil liberties|civil liberty]]. It further states that everyone is entitled to these rights "without distinction of any kind, such as race, [[Human skin color|colour]], sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, [[Nationality|national]] or [[society|social]] origin, property, birth or other status".

The UN does not define "racism"; however, it does define "racial discrimination". According to the 1965 UN [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]],&lt;ref name="UNICERD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CERD.aspx |title=International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination |publisher=[[United Nations]]. Adopted December 1965, entered into force January 1969 |access-date=22 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240702232413/https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-convention-elimination-all-forms-racial |archive-date=2 July 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The term "racial discrimination" shall mean any distinction, exclusion, restriction, or preference based on race, colour, [[Cultural heritage|descent]], or national or [[ethnicity|ethnic]] origin that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In their 1978 [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]] Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice (Article 1), the UN states, "All human beings belong to a single species and are descended from a common stock. They are born equal in dignity and rights and all form an integral part of humanity."&lt;ref name="UNESCO78"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13161&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice |publisher=[[United Nations]] |date=1978 |access-date=22 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221122163043/https://www.unesco.org/en/legal-affairs/declaration-race-and-racial-prejudice |archive-date=22 November 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN definition of racial discrimination does not make any distinction between [[Discrimination based on skin color|discrimination based on ethnicity and race]], in part because the distinction between the two has been a matter of debate among [[academia|academics]], including [[Anthropology|anthropologists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Metraux |first1=A. |year=1950 |title=United nations Economic and Security Council Statement by Experts on Problems of Race |journal=American Anthropologist |volume=53 |issue=1|pages=142–145 |doi=10.1525/aa.1951.53.1.02a00370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in [[Law of the United Kingdom|British law]], the phrase ''racial group'' means "any group of people who are defined by reference to their race, colour, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/prosecution/rrpbcrbook.html |title=Racist and Religious Crime – CPS Prosecution Policy |publisher=The CPS |access-date=23 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119032241/http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/prosecution/rrpbcrbook.html |archive-date=19 January 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norway, the word "race" has been removed from national laws concerning discrimination because the use of the phrase is considered problematic and unethical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jon Dagsland |last=Holgersen |date=23 July 2010 |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/norge/Rasebegrepet-pa-vei-ut-av-loven-215256b.html |title=Rasebegrepet på vei ut av loven |language=no |trans-title=The concept of race on the way out of the law |work=[[Aftenposten]] |access-date=6 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240404043334/https://www.aftenposten.no/norge/i/eKXpK/rasebegrepet-paa-vei-ut-av-loven |archive-date=4 April 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/debatt/Rase-Et-ubrukelig-ord-6610475.html |title=Rase: Et ubrukelig ord |language=no |trans-title=Race: A useless word |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date= |access-date=10 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301214159/http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/debatt/Rase-Et-ubrukelig-ord-6610475.html |archive-date=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Norwegian Anti-Discrimination Act bans discrimination based on ethnicity, national origin, descent, and skin color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Ministry of Labour and Social Inclusion]] |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/ad/doc/lover_regler/reglement/2005/the-anti-discrimination-act.html?id=420606 |title=The Act on prohibition of discrimination based on ethnicity, religion, etc. |website=Regjeringen.no | date=26 September 2005 |access-date=10 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230319090031/https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dokumenter/the-anti-discrimination-act/id420606/ |archive-date=19 March 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social and behavioral sciences ===
{{Main|Sociology of race and ethnic relations}}

[[Sociology|Sociologists]], in general, recognize "race" as a [[Social constructivism|social construct]]. This means that, although the concepts of race and racism are based on observable biological characteristics, any conclusions drawn about race on the basis of those observations are heavily influenced by cultural ideologies. Racism, as an ideology, exists in a society at both the individual and institutional level.

While much of the research and work on racism during the last half-century or so has concentrated on "white racism" in the Western world, historical accounts of race-based social practices can be found across the globe.&lt;ref name="Gossett"&gt;Gossett, Thomas F. ''Race: The History of an Idea in America''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-19-509778-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, racism can be broadly defined to encompass individual and group prejudices and acts of discrimination that result in material and cultural advantages conferred on a majority or a dominant social group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Racist America: Roots, Current Realities, and Future Reparations |publisher=[[Routledge]] |last=Feagin |first=Joe R. |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-415-92531-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/racistamericaroo00feag_0}}&lt;/ref&gt; So-called "white racism" focuses on societies in which white populations are the majority or the dominant social group. In studies of these majority white societies, the aggregate of material and cultural advantages is usually termed "[[white privilege]]".

Race and race relations are prominent areas of study in [[sociology]] and [[economics]]. Much of the sociological literature focuses on white racism. Some of the earliest sociological works on racism were written by sociologist [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], the first African American to earn a doctoral degree from [[Harvard University]].

In sociology and [[social psychology]], [[Identity (social science)|racial identity]] and the acquisition of that identity, is often used as a variable in racism studies. Racial ideologies and racial identity affect individuals' perception of race and discrimination. Cazenave and Maddern (1999) define racism as "a highly organized system of 'race'-based group privilege that operates at every level of society and is held together by a sophisticated ideology of color/'race' supremacy. Racial centrality (the extent to which a culture recognizes individuals' racial identity) appears to affect the degree of discrimination African-American young adults perceive whereas racial ideology may buffer the detrimental emotional effects of that discrimination."&lt;ref name="Cazenave"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Defending the White Race: White Male Faculty Opposition to a White Racism Course |last1=Cazenave |first1=Noel A. |first2=Darlene Alvarez |last2=Maddern |name-list-style=amp |journal=Race and Society |year=1999 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=25–50 |doi=10.1016/s1090-9524(00)00003-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sellers and Shelton (2003) found that a relationship between racial discrimination and emotional distress was moderated by racial ideology and social beliefs.&lt;ref name="Sellers03"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The role of racial identity in perceived racial discrimination |last1=Sellers |first1=R.

Some sociologists also argue that, particularly in the West, where racism is often [[Social control|negatively sanctioned]] in society, racism has changed from being a blatant to a more covert expression of racial prejudice. The "newer" (more hidden and less easily detectable) forms of racism—which can be considered embedded in social processes and structures—are more difficult to explore and challenge. It has been suggested that, while in many countries overt or explicit racism has become increasingly [[taboo]], even among those who display egalitarian explicit attitudes, an [[Implicit-association test|implicit]] or [[aversive racism]] is still maintained subconsciously.&lt;ref name="Greenwald" /&gt;

This process has been studied extensively in social psychology as implicit associations and [[implicit attitude]]s, a component of [[implicit cognition]]. Implicit attitudes are evaluations that occur without conscious awareness towards an attitude object or the self. These evaluations are generally either favorable or unfavorable. They come about from various influences in the individual experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Implicit attitudes 101: Theoretical and empirical Insights |last=Devos |first=T. |publisher=[[Psychology Press]] |year=2008 |location=New York |chapter=Attitudes and attitude change |pages=61–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implicit attitudes are not consciously identified (or they are inaccurately identified) traces of past experience that mediate favorable or unfavorable feelings, thoughts, or actions towards social objects.&lt;ref name="Greenwald"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Greenwald |first1=A.G. |last2=Banaji |first2=M.

Therefore, subconscious racism can influence our visual processing and how our minds work when we are subliminally exposed to faces of different colors. In thinking about crime, for example, [[Social psychology|social psychologist]] [[Jennifer Eberhardt|Jennifer L. Eberhardt]] (2004) of [[Stanford University]] holds that, "blackness is so associated with crime you're ready to pick out these crime objects."&lt;ref name="Eberhardt04"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Seeing Black: Race, Crime, and Visual Processing |last=Eberhardt |first=Jennifer L. |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |year=2004 |volume=87 |issue=6 |pages=876–893 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.87.6.876 |display-authors=etal |pmid=15598112 |citeseerx=10.1.1.408.3542|s2cid=6322610 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such exposures influence our minds and they can cause subconscious racism in our behavior towards other people or even towards objects. Thus, racist thoughts and actions can arise from stereotypes and fears of which we are not aware.&lt;ref name="Eberhardt14"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=itTHBAAAQBAJ&amp;q=Racism+goes+beyond+prejudicial+discrimination+and+bigotry.+It+arises+from+stereotypes+and+fears+of+which+we+are+vastly+unaware.&amp;pg=PA202 |title=Drugs, Crime, and Justice |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |date=2014 |last1=Belenko |first1=Steven |first2=Cassia |last2=Spohn |author2-link=Cassia Spohn |name-list-style=amp |isbn=978-1-4833-1295-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, scientists and activists have warned that the use of the stereotype "Nigerian Prince" for referring to [[advance-fee scam]]mers is racist, i.e. "reducing Nigeria to a nation of scammers and fraudulent princes, as some people still do online, is a [[stereotype]] that needs to be called out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yékú |first1=James |title=Anti-Afropolitan ethics and the performative politics of online scambaiting |journal=[[Social Dynamics]] |date=3 May 2020 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=240–258 |doi=10.1080/02533952.2020.1813943 |s2cid=222232833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Humanities ===
[[Language]], [[linguistics]], and [[discourse]] are active areas of study in the [[humanities]], along with literature and the arts. [[Discourse analysis]] seeks to reveal the meaning of race and the actions of racists through careful study of the ways in which these factors of human society are described and discussed in various written and oral works. For example, Van Dijk (1992) examines the different ways in which descriptions of racism and racist actions are depicted by the perpetrators of such actions as well as by their victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analyzing Racism Through Discourse Analysis Some Methodological Reflections in Race and Ethnicity in Research Methods |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |last=Van Dijk |first=Tuen |year=1992 |location=Newbury Park, CA |pages=92–134 |isbn=978-0-8039-5007-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that when descriptions of actions have negative implications for the majority, and especially for white elites, they are often seen as controversial and such controversial interpretations are typically marked with quotation marks or they are greeted with expressions of distance or doubt. The previously cited book, ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]]'' by W.E.B. Du Bois, represents early [[African-American literature]] that describes the author's experiences with racism when he was traveling in the [[Southern United States|South]] as an African American.

Much American fictional literature has focused on issues of racism and the black "racial experience" in the US, including works written by whites, such as ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', and ''[[Imitation of Life (novel)|Imitation of Life]]'', or even the non-fiction work ''[[Black Like Me]]''. These books, and others like them, feed into what has been called the "[[white savior narrative in film]]", in which the heroes and heroines are white even though the story is about things that happen to black characters. [[Content analysis|Textual analysis]] of such writings can contrast sharply with black authors' descriptions of African Americans and their experiences in US society. African-American writers have sometimes been portrayed in [[African-American studies]] as retreating from racial issues when they write about "[[Whiteness studies|whiteness]]", while others identify this as an African-American literary tradition called "the literature of white estrangement", part of a multi-pronged effort to challenge and dismantle [[white supremacy]] in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Souls of White Folk: African American Writers Theorize Whiteness |publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]] |last=Watson |first=Veronica T. |year=2013 |location=Jackson |page=137 |isbn=978-1-4968-0245-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Popular usage ===
According to dictionary definitions, racism is prejudice and discrimination based on race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/racism |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927163823/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/racism |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 September 2016 |title=Definition of racism in English |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |access-date=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racism |title=Definition of racism |dictionary=Merriam-Webster |access-date=3 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225025723/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racism |archive-date=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racism can also be said to describe a condition in society in which a dominant racial group benefits from the [[oppression]] of others, whether that group wants such benefits or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reverse-racism-isnt-a-thing_us_55d60a91e4b07addcb45da97 |title='Reverse Racism': 4 Myths That Need To Stop |date=26 August 2015 |access-date=28 February 2016 |last=Blay |first=Zeba |publisher=[[HuffPost|Huffpost Black Voices]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240511024537/https://www.huffpost.com/entry/reverse-racism-isnt-a-thing_n_55d60a91e4b07addcb45da97 |archive-date=11 May 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foucauldian scholar Ladelle McWhorter, in her 2009 book, ''Racism and Sexual Oppression in Anglo-America: A Genealogy'', posits modern racism similarly, focusing on the notion of a dominant group, usually whites, vying for racial purity and progress, rather than an overt or obvious ideology focused on the oppression of nonwhites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Racism and sexual oppression in Anglo-America: a genealogy |last=McWhorter |first=Ladelle |year=2009 |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |isbn=978-0-253-35296-5 |location=Bloomington |oclc=406565635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In popular usage, as in some academic usage, little distinction is made between "racism" and "[[ethnocentrism]]". Often, the two are listed together as "racial and ethnic" in describing some action or outcome that is associated with prejudice within a majority or dominant group in society. Furthermore, the meaning of the term racism is often conflated with the terms prejudice, [[bigotry]], and discrimination. Racism is a complex concept that can involve each of those; but it cannot be equated with, nor is it synonymous, with these other terms.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

The term is often used in relation to what is seen as prejudice within a minority or subjugated group, as in the concept of [[reverse racism]]. "Reverse racism" is a concept often used to describe acts of discrimination or hostility against members of a dominant racial or ethnic group while favoring members of minority groups.&lt;ref name="Cashmore"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Cashmore |editor-first=Ellis |editor-link=Ellis Cashmore |title=Encyclopedia of Race and Ethnic Studies |date=2004 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-1-134-44706-0 |page=373 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2L-5lBDPJJMC&amp;q=%22reverse+racism%22&amp;pg=PA373 |chapter=Reverse Racism/Discrimination}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yee"&gt;{{cite book |last=Yee |first=June Ying |editor-last=Shaefer |editor-first=Richard T. |title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity, and Society |date=2008 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |isbn=978-1-4129-2694-2 |pages=1118–1119 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMUola6pDnkC&amp;q=%22reverse+racism%22&amp;pg=PT1244 |chapter=Racism, Types of}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been used especially in the United States in debates over [[color-conscious]] policies (such as [[affirmative action]]) intended to remedy racial inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ansell |first=Amy Elizabeth |title=Race and Ethnicity: The Key Concepts |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8_y3Q6fzgQAC&amp;q=%22reverse%20racism%22 |date=2013 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-0-415-33794-6 |chapter=Affirmative Action; Color-Consciousness |pages=4, 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many experts and other commenters view reverse racism as a myth rather than a reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Wida |first=Erica Chayes |date=26 June 2020 |title=What does 'reverse racism' mean and is it actually real?

Academics commonly define racism not only in terms of individual prejudice, but also in terms of a power structure that protects the interests of the dominant culture and actively discriminates against ethnic minorities.{{r|Cashmore|Yee}} From this perspective, while members of ethnic minorities may be prejudiced against members of the dominant culture, they lack the political and economic power to actively oppress them, and they are therefore not practicing "racism".{{r|Dennis|Cashmore}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ansell |first=Amy Elizabeth |title=Race and Ethnicity: The Key Concepts |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8_y3Q6fzgQAC&amp;q=%22reverse%20racism%22 |date=2013 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-0-415-33794-6 |chapter=Reverse Racism |pages=135–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aspects ==
{{Globalize|1=section|2=USA|date=May 2022}}
The ideology underlying racism can manifest in many aspects of social life. Such aspects are described in this section, although the list is not exhaustive.

=== Aversive racism ===
{{main|Aversive racism}}

Aversive racism is a form of implicit racism, in which a person's unconscious negative evaluations of racial or ethnic minorities are realized by a persistent avoidance of interaction with other racial and ethnic groups. As opposed to traditional, overt racism, which is characterized by overt hatred for and explicit discrimination against racial/ethnic minorities, aversive racism is characterized by more complex, [[ambivalence|ambivalent]] expressions and attitudes.&lt;ref name="Gaertner"&gt;{{cite book |year=1986 |chapter=The aversive form of racism |pages=61–89 |editor1-first=John F. |editor1-last=Dovidio |editor1-link=John Dovidio |editor2-first=Samuel L. |editor2-last=Gaertner |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/prejudicediscrim0000unse/page/61/mode/2up|title=Prejudice, Discrimination and Racism |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-221425-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aversive racism is similar in implications to the concept of symbolic or modern racism (described below), which is also a form of implicit, unconscious, or covert attitude which results in unconscious forms of discrimination.

The term was coined by Joel Kovel to describe the subtle racial behaviors of any ethnic or racial group who rationalize their aversion to a particular group by appeal to rules or stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Gaertner" /&gt; People who behave in an aversively racial way may profess egalitarian beliefs, and will often deny their racially motivated behavior; nevertheless they change their behavior when dealing with a member of another race or ethnic group than the one they belong to. The motivation for the change is thought to be implicit or subconscious. Experiments have provided empirical support for the existence of aversive racism. Aversive racism has been shown to have potentially serious implications for decision making in employment, in legal decisions and in helping behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(04)36001-6 |chapter=Aversive Racism |title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology |year=2004 |last1=Dovidio |first1=John F. |author1-link=John Dovidio |last2=Gaertner |first2=Samuel L. |isbn=978-0-12-015236-0 |volume=36 |pages=1–52 |editor1-first=James M. |editor1-last=Olson |editor2-first=Mark P. |editor2-last=Zanna |editor2-link=Mark Zanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0901_1 |title=Differences in Helping Whites and Blacks: A Meta-Analysis |year=2005 |last1=Saucier |first1=Donald A. |last2=Miller |first2=Carol T. |last3=Doucet |first3=Nicole |journal=[[Personality and Social Psychology Review]] |volume=9 |pages=2–16 |pmid=15745861 |issue=1 |s2cid=14542705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Color blindness ===
{{main|Color blindness (race)}}

In relation to racism, color blindness is the disregard of racial characteristics in [[social interaction]], for example in the rejection of affirmative action, as a way to address the results of past patterns of discrimination. Critics of this attitude argue that by refusing to attend to racial disparities, [[racial color blindness]] in fact unconsciously perpetuates the patterns that produce racial inequality.&lt;ref name="Ansell 2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ansell |first=Amy E. |editor-last=Schaefer |editor-first=Richard T. |title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity, and Society |date=2008 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |isbn=978-1-4522-6586-5 |pages=320–322 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=STR1AwAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22color+blindness%22 |chapter=Color Blindness}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eduardo Bonilla-Silva]] argues that color blind racism arises from an "abstract [[liberalism]], biologization of culture, naturalization of racial matters, and minimization of racism".&lt;ref name="Bonilla-Silva"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bonilla-Silva |first=Eduardo |author-link=Eduardo Bonilla-Silva |title=White Supremacy and Racism in the Post-Civil Rights Era |publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers, Inc. |year=2001 |pages=137–166 |isbn=978-1-58826-032-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Color blind practices are "subtle, [[institution]]al, and apparently nonracial"&lt;ref name="Bonilla-Silva1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bonilla-Silva |first=Eduardo |author-link=Eduardo Bonilla-Silva |title=Racism without Racists: Color-blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in the United States |year=2003 |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |location=Lanham |isbn=978-0-7425-1633-5 |pages=2–29 |url=https://archive.org/details/racismwithoutrac0000boni_b6w1 }}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; because race is explicitly ignored in decision-making. If race is disregarded in predominantly white populations, for example, whiteness becomes the [[norm (social)|normative]] standard, whereas [[people of color]] are [[Othering|othered]], and the racism these individuals experience may be minimized or erased.&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Race Is – Race Isn't: Critical Race Theory and Qualitative Studies in Education |last=Parker |first=Laurence |year=1999 |publisher=Westview Press |isbn=978-0-8133-9069-7 |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Social"&gt;{{cite book |title=Our Social World: Introduction to Sociology (Condensed Version) |publisher=Sage |year=2015 |location=Los Angeles |isbn=978-1-4522-7575-8 |first1=Jeanne H. |last1=Ballantine |author1-link=Jeanne Ballantine |first2=Keith A. |last2=Roberts |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an individual level, people with "color blind prejudice" reject racist ideology, but also reject systemic policies intended to fix [[institutional racism]].&lt;ref name="Social" /&gt;

=== Cultural ===
{{see also|Cultural racism|Xenophobia}}
Cultural racism manifests as societal beliefs and customs that promote the assumption that the products of a given culture, including the language and traditions of that culture, are superior to those of other cultures. It shares a great deal with [[xenophobia]], which is often characterized by fear of, or aggression toward, members of an [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]] by members of an [[Ingroups and outgroups|ingroup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=xenophobia - European Commission |url=https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/networks/european-migration-network-emn/emn-asylum-and-migration-glossary/glossary/xenophobia_en |access-date=17 March 2024 |website=home-affairs.ec.europa.eu |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240701172343/https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/networks/european-migration-network-emn/emn-asylum-and-migration-glossary/glossary/xenophobia_en |archive-date=1 July 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic ===
{{Further|Criticism of capitalism#Racism|Racial pay gap in the United States|Racial wealth gap in the United States}}
Historical economic or social disparity is alleged to be a form of [[discrimination]] caused by past racism and historical reasons, affecting the present generation through deficits in the formal education and kinds of preparation in previous generations, and through primarily unconscious racist attitudes and actions on members of the general population.

[[Institutional racism]] (also known as [[structural racism]], [[state racism]] or systemic racism) is racial discrimination by governments, corporations, religions, or educational institutions or other large organizations with the power to influence the lives of many individuals. [[Stokely Carmichael]] is credited for coining the phrase ''institutional racism'' in the late 1960s. He defined the term as "the collective failure of an organization to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Richard W. |last=Race |url=http://www.shef.ac.uk/socstudies/Shop/race_article.pdf |title=Analysing ethnic education policy-making in England and Wales |series=Sheffield Online Papers in Social Research |publisher=[[University of Sheffield]] |page=12 |access-date=20 June 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923102013/http://www.shef.ac.uk/socstudies/Shop/race_article.pdf |archive-date=23 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maulana Karenga]] argued that racism constituted the destruction of culture, language, religion, and human possibility and that the effects of racism were "the morally monstrous destruction of human possibility involved redefining African humanity to the world, poisoning past, present and future relations with others who only know us through this stereotyping and thus damaging the truly human relations among peoples".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Karenga |first1=Maulana |author-link=Maulana Karenga |title=The Ethics of Reparations: Engaging the Holocaust of Enslavement |url=http://www.ncobraonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Karenga-THE-ETHICS-OF-REPARATIONS.pdf |publisher=[[The National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America]] (N'COBRA) |access-date=31 January 2017 |date=22–23 June 2001 |archive-date=1 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801090448/http://www.ncobraonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Karenga-THE-ETHICS-OF-REPARATIONS.pdf |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Othering ===
{{main|Othering}}
Othering is the term used by some to describe a system of discrimination whereby the characteristics of a group are used to distinguish them as separate from the norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mountz |first=Alison |date=2009 |title=Key Concepts in Political Geography |publisher=Sage |page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Othering plays a fundamental role in the history and continuation of racism. To [[Objectification|objectify]] a culture as something different, exotic or underdeveloped is to generalize that it is not like 'normal' society. Europe's colonial attitude towards the Orientals exemplifies this as it was thought that the East was the opposite of the West; feminine where the West was masculine, weak where the West was strong and traditional where the West was progressive.&lt;ref name="Said, Edward 1978 pp.357"&gt;{{cite book |last=Said |first=Edward |author-link=Edward Said |date=1978 |title=Orientalism |title-link=Orientalism (book) |location=New York |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] |page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; By making these generalizations and othering the East, Europe was simultaneously defining herself as the norm, further entrenching the gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gregory |first=Derek |date=2004 |title=The Colonial Present |publisher=[[Blackwell publishers]] |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the process of othering relies on imagined difference, or the expectation of difference. Spatial difference can be enough to conclude that "we" are "here" and the "others" are over "there".&lt;ref name="Said, Edward 1978 pp.357"/&gt; Imagined differences serve to categorize people into groups and assign them characteristics that suit the imaginer's expectations.{{sfn|Said|1978|p=360}}

Some scholars argue that in the US, earlier violent and aggressive forms of racism have evolved into a more subtle form of prejudice in the late 20th century. This new form of racism is sometimes referred to as "modern racism" and it is characterized by outwardly acting unprejudiced while inwardly maintaining prejudiced attitudes, displaying subtle prejudiced behaviors such as actions informed by attributing qualities to others based on racial stereotypes, and evaluating the same behavior differently based on the race of the person being evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aronson |first1=E. |last2=Wilson |first2=T. D. |last3=Akert |first3=R. M. |date=2010 |title=Social Psychology |edition=7th |location=New York |publisher=Pearson}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is based on studies of prejudice and discriminatory behavior, where some people will act ambivalently towards black people, with positive reactions in certain, more public contexts, but more negative views and expressions in more private contexts. This ambivalence may also be visible for example in hiring decisions where job candidates that are otherwise positively evaluated may be unconsciously disfavored by employers in the final decision because of their race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McConahay |first1=J.

=== Subconscious biases ===

Recent research has shown that individuals who consciously claim to reject racism may still exhibit race-based subconscious biases in their decision-making processes.

In 1943, Japan and its allies declared work for the abolition of racial discrimination to be their aim at the [[Greater East Asia Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=C.

In 1950, [[UNESCO]] suggested in ''[[The Race Question]]''—a statement signed by 21 scholars such as [[Ashley Montagu]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Gunnar Myrdal]], [[Julian Huxley]], etc.—to "drop the term ''race'' altogether and instead speak of [[ethnic groups]]". The statement condemned [[scientific racism]] theories that had played a role in [[the Holocaust]]. It aimed both at debunking scientific racist theories, by popularizing modern knowledge concerning "the race question", and morally condemned racism as contrary to the philosophy of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and its assumption of [[Social equality|equal rights]] for all. Along with Myrdal's ''[[An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy]]'' (1944), ''The Race Question'' influenced the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court [[racial segregation in the United States|desegregation]] decision in ''[[Brown v.

==Ideology==
[[File:Racistcampaignposter1.jpg|thumb|left|A pro–[[Hiester Clymer]] racist political campaign poster from the [[1866 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election]]]]
Racism existed during the 19th century as [[scientific racism]], which attempted to provide a [[typology (anthropology)|racial classification]] of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre-André Taguieff]], ''La force du préjugé'', 1987 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1775 [[Johann Blumenbach]] divided the world's population into five groups according to skin color (Caucasians, Mongols, etc.), positing the view that the non-Caucasians had arisen through a process of degeneration. Another early view in scientific racism was the [[Polygenism|polygenist view]], which held that the different races had been separately created. Polygenist [[Christoph Meiners]] (1747 – May 1810) for example, split mankind into two divisions which he labeled the "beautiful White race" and the "ugly Black race". In Meiners' book, ''The Outline of History of Mankind'', he claimed that a main characteristic of race is either beauty or ugliness. He viewed only the white race as beautiful. He considered ugly races to be inferior, immoral and animal-like.

[[Anders Retzius]] (1796— 1860) demonstrated that neither Europeans nor others are one "pure race", but of mixed origins. While [[Typology (anthropology)#Typology|discredited]], derivations of Blumenbach's taxonomy are [[Definitions of whiteness in the United States|still widely used]] for the classification of the population in the United States. [[Hans Peder Steensby]], while strongly emphasizing that all humans today are of mixed origins, in 1907 claimed that the origins of human differences must be traced extraordinarily far back in time, and conjectured that the "purest race" today would be the [[Australian Aboriginals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://img.kb.dk/tidsskriftdk/pdf/gto/gto_0019-PDF/gto_0019_67206.pdf |title=Racestudier i Danmark |trans-title=Race Studies in Denmark |journal=[[Danish Journal of Geography|Geografisk Tidsskrift]] |volume=19 |language=da |year=1907 |access-date=14 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240403224723/https://img.kb.dk/tidsskriftdk/pdf/gto/gto_0019-PDF/gto_0019_67206.pdf |archive-date=3 April 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DurbanSign1989.jpg|thumb|A sign on a [[racially segregated]] beach during [[Apartheid]] in South Africa, stating that the area is for the "sole use of members of the white race group"]]
Scientific racism fell strongly out of favor in the early 20th century, but the origins of fundamental human and societal differences are still researched within [[academia]], in fields such as [[human genetics]] including [[paleogenetics]], [[social anthropology]], [[comparative politics]], [[history of religions]], [[history of ideas]], [[prehistory]], [[history]], [[ethics]], and [[psychiatry]]. There is widespread rejection of any methodology based on anything similar to Blumenbach's races. It is more unclear to which extent and when [[ethnic stereotype|ethnic]] and national [[archetype|stereotypes]] are accepted.

Although after [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]], racist ideologies were discredited on ethical, political and scientific grounds, racism and [[racial discrimination]] have remained widespread around the world.

[[W.E.B. Du Bois|Du Bois]] observed that it is not so much "race" that we think about, but culture: "...&amp;nbsp;a common history, common laws and religion, similar habits of thought and a conscious striving together for certain ideals of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=1119 |title=The Conservation of Races |last=Du Bois |first=W.

Ultimately, race came to represent not only the most important traits of the human body, but was also regarded as decisively shaping the character and personality of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Marius |last=Turda |title=The idea of national superiority in Central Europe, 1880–1918 |year=2004 |publisher=[[Edwin Mellen Press]] |isbn=978-0-7734-6180-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, culture is the physical manifestation created by ethnic groupings, as such fully determined by racial characteristics. Culture and race became considered intertwined and dependent upon each other, sometimes even to the extent of including nationality or language to the set of definition. Pureness of race tended to be related to rather superficial characteristics that were easily addressed and advertised, such as blondness. Racial qualities tended to be related to nationality and language rather than the actual geographic distribution of racial characteristics. In the case of [[Nordicism]], the denomination "[[Germanic people|Germanic]]" was equivalent to superiority of race.

Bolstered by some [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] values and achievements of choice, this concept of racial superiority evolved to distinguish from other cultures that were considered inferior or impure. This emphasis on culture corresponds to the modern mainstream definition of racism: "[r]acism does not originate from the existence of 'races'. It ''creates'' them through a process of social division into categories: anybody can be racialised, independently of their somatic, cultural, religious differences."&lt;ref&gt;National Analytical Study on Racist Violence and Crime, RAXEN Focal Point for Italy – Annamaria Rivera {{cite web |url=http://fra.europa.eu/fra/material/pub/RAXEN/4/RV/CS-RV-NR-IT.pdf |title=Helping to make fundamental rights a reality for everyone in the European Union |author=FRA |publisher=[[Fundamental Rights Agency|European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights]] |access-date=22 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216225620/http://fra.europa.eu/fra/material/pub/RAXEN/4/RV/CS-RV-NR-IT.pdf |archive-date=16 December 2008 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition explicitly ignores the biological concept of race, which is still subject to scientific debate. In the words of [[David C. Rowe]], "[a] racial concept, although sometimes in the guise of another name, will remain in use in biology and in other fields because scientists, as well as lay persons, are fascinated by human diversity, some of which is captured by race."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Joseph L. |last=Graves |author-link=Joseph L.

Racial prejudice became subject to international legislation. For instance, the [[Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]], adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 20 November 1963, addresses racial prejudice explicitly next to discrimination for reasons of race, colour or ethnic origin (Article I).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070808133610/http://scm.oas.org/doc_public/ENGLISH/HIST_02/CP09414E07.DOC Inter-American Convention against Racism and all forms of Discrimination and Intolerance – Study prepared by the Inter-American Juridical Committee] 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnicity and ethnic conflicts==

Debates over the origins of racism often suffer from a lack of clarity over the term. Many use the term "racism" to refer to more general phenomena, such as [[xenophobia]] and [[ethnocentrism]], although scholars attempt to clearly distinguish those phenomena from racism as an [[ideology]] or from scientific racism, which has little to do with ordinary xenophobia. Others conflate recent forms of racism with earlier forms of ethnic and national conflict. In most cases, ethno-national conflict seems to owe itself to conflict over land and strategic resources. In some cases, [[ethnicity]] and [[nationalism]] were harnessed in order to rally [[combatant]]s in wars between great religious empires (for example, the Muslim Turks and the Catholic Austro-Hungarians).

Notions of race and racism have often played central roles in [[ethnic conflict]]s. Throughout history, when an adversary is identified as "other" based on notions of race or ethnicity (in particular when "other" is interpreted to mean "inferior"), the means employed by the self-presumed "superior" party to appropriate territory, human chattel, or material wealth often have been more ruthless, more brutal, and less constrained by [[morality|moral]] or [[ethics|ethical]] considerations. According to historian Daniel Richter, [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] saw the emergence on both sides of the conflict of "the novel idea that all Native people were 'Indians,' that all Euro-Americans were 'Whites,' and that all on one side must unite to destroy the other".&lt;ref&gt;Richter, ''[[Facing East from Indian Country]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;208&lt;/ref&gt; [[Basil Davidson]] states in his documentary, ''Africa: Different but Equal'', that racism, in fact, only just recently surfaced as late as the 19th century, due to the need for a justification for slavery in the Americas.

Historically, racism was a major driving force behind the [[Transatlantic slave trade]].&lt;ref&gt;[[George M. Fredrickson|Fredrickson, George M.]] 1988. ''The Arrogance of Race: Historical Perspectives on Slavery, Racism, and Social Inequality''. Middletown, Conn: Wesleyan University Press&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a major force behind [[racial segregation]], especially in the [[United States]] in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and South Africa under [[apartheid]]; 19th and 20th century racism in the [[Western culture|Western world]] is particularly well documented and constitutes a reference point in studies and discourses about racism.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Racism has played a role in [[genocide]]s such as the [[Armenian genocide]], and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], and colonial projects like the European [[colonization of the Americas]], [[Colonisation of Africa|Africa]], and [[Western imperialism in Asia|Asia]]. [[Indigenous peoples]] have been—and are—often subject to racist attitudes. Practices and ideologies of racism are condemned by the United Nations in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly, ''Universal Declaration of Human Rights'', 10 December 1948, 217 A (III), available at: [https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/] [accessed 18 July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Europe was confronted with the new "[[nationalities]] question", leading to reconfigurations of the European map, on which the frontiers between the states had been delineated during the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. [[Nationalism]] had made its first appearance with the invention of the ''[[levée en masse]]'' by the [[French Revolution]]aries, thus inventing mass [[conscription]] in order to be able to defend the newly founded [[French First Republic|Republic]] against the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' order represented by the European monarchies. This led to the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] (1792–1802) and then to the conquests of [[Napoleon]], and to the subsequent European-wide debates on the concepts and realities of [[nation]]s, and in particular of [[nation-state]]s. The [[Westphalia Treaty]] had divided Europe into various empires and kingdoms (such as the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Swedish Empire]], the [[France|Kingdom of France]], etc.), and for centuries wars were waged between princes (''[[Kabinettskriege]]'' in German).

Modern [[nation-state]]s appeared in the wake of the French Revolution, with the formation of [[patriotism|patriotic]] sentiments for the first time in [[Enlightenment Spain|Spain]] during the [[Peninsula War]] (1808–1813, known in Spain as the Independence War). Despite the restoration of the previous order with the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]], the "nationalities question" became the main problem of Europe during the [[Industrial Era]], leading in particular to the [[1848 Revolutions]], the [[Italian unification]] completed during the 1871 [[Franco-Prussian War]], which itself culminated in the proclamation of the [[German Empire]] in the Hall of Mirrors in the [[Palace of Versailles]], thus achieving the [[German unification]].

Meanwhile, the [[Ottoman Empire]], the "[[sick man of Europe]]", was confronted with endless nationalist movements, which, along with the dissolving of the [[Austrian-Hungarian Empire]], would lead to the creation, after [[World War I]], of the various nation-states of the [[Balkan]]s, with "national [[minorities]]" in their borders.&lt;ref&gt;On this "[[nationalities]] question" and the problem of nationalism, see the relevant articles for a non-exhaustive account of the state of contemporary historical researches; famous works include: [[Ernest Gellner]], ''Nations and Nationalism'' (1983); [[Eric Hobsbawm]],''The Age of Revolution : Europe 1789–1848'' (1962), ''Nations and Nationalism since 1780 : programme, myth, reality'' (1990); [[Benedict Anderson]], ''[[Imagined Communities]]'' (1991); [[Charles Tilly]], ''Coercion, Capital and European States AD 990–1992'' (1990); [[Anthony D. Smith]], ''Theories of Nationalism'' (1971), etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ethnic nationalism]], which advocated the belief in a hereditary membership of the nation, made its appearance in the historical context surrounding the creation of the modern nation-states.

One of its main influences was the [[Romantic nationalist]] movement at the turn of the 19th century, represented by figures such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Johann Herder]] (1744–1803), [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Johan Fichte]] (1762–1814) in the ''Addresses to the German Nation'' (1808), [[Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831), or also, in France, [[Jules Michelet]] (1798–1874). It was opposed to [[liberal nationalism]], represented by authors such as [[Ernest Renan]] (1823–1892), who conceived of the nation as a community, which, instead of being based on the ''[[Volk]]'' ethnic group and on a specific, common language, was founded on the subjective will to live together ("the nation is a daily [[plebiscite]]", 1882) or also [[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873).&lt;ref&gt;[[John Stuart Mill]], ''Considerations on Representative Government'', 1861&lt;/ref&gt;
Ethnic nationalism blended with scientific racist discourses, as well as with "continental [[imperialist]]" ([[Hannah Arendt]], 1951&lt;ref name="Arendt"&gt;[[Hannah Arendt]], ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' (1951)&lt;/ref&gt;) discourses, for example in the [[pan-Germanism]] discourses, which postulated the racial superiority of the German ''[[Volk]]'' (people/folk). The [[Alldeutscher Verband|Pan-German League]] (''Alldeutscher Verband''), created in 1891, promoted [[German colonial empire|German imperialism]] and "[[racial hygiene]]", and was opposed to intermarriage with [[Jews]]. Another popular current, the ''[[Völkisch movement]]'', was also an important proponent of the [[German ethnic nationalist]] discourse, and it combined Pan-Germanism with modern [[racial antisemitism]]. Members of the Völkisch movement, in particular the [[Thule Society]], would participate in the founding of the [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP) in Munich in 1918, the predecessor of the [[Nazi Party]]. Pan-Germanism played a decisive role in the [[interwar period]] of the 1920s–1930s.&lt;ref name=Arendt /&gt;

These currents began to associate the idea of the nation with the biological concept of a "[[master race]]" (often the "[[Aryan race]]" or the "[[Nordic race]]") issued from the scientific racist discourse. They conflated nationalities with ethnic groups, called "races", in a radical distinction from previous racial discourses that posited the existence of a "race struggle" inside the nation and the state itself. Furthermore, they believed that political boundaries should mirror these alleged racial and ethnic groups, thus justifying [[ethnic cleansing]], in order to achieve "racial purity" and also to achieve ethnic homogeneity in the nation-state.

Such racist discourses, combined with nationalism, were not, however, limited to pan-Germanism. In France, the transition from Republican liberal nationalism, to ethnic nationalism, which made nationalism a characteristic of [[History of far-right movements in France|far-right movements in France]], took place during the [[Dreyfus Affair]] at the end of the 19th century. During several years, a nationwide crisis affected French society, concerning the alleged treason of [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a French Jewish military officer. The country polarized itself into two opposite camps, one represented by [[Émile Zola]], who wrote ''[[J'Accuse…!]]'' in defense of Alfred Dreyfus, and the other represented by the nationalist poet, [[Maurice Barrès]] (1862–1923), one of the founders of the ethnic nationalist discourse in France.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Barrès]], ''Le Roman de l'énergie nationale'' (The Novel of National Energy, a trilogy started in 1897)&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[Charles Maurras]] (1868–1952), founder of the monarchist ''[[Action française]]'' movement, theorized the "anti-France", composed of the "four confederate states of Protestants, Jews, Freemasons and foreigners" (his actual word for the latter being the pejorative ''[[Metic|métèques]]''). Indeed, to him the first three were all "internal foreigners", who threatened the ethnic unity of the [[French people]].

Historian Dante A. Puzzo, in his discussion of Aristotle, racism, and the ancient world writes that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Racism and the Western Tradition |first=Dante A. |last=Puzzo |journal=[[Journal of the History of Ideas]] |volume=25 |issue=4 |year=1964 |pages=579–586 |doi=10.2307/2708188 |jstor=2708188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Racism rests on two basic assumptions: that a correlation exists between physical characteristics and moral qualities; that mankind is divisible into superior and inferior stocks. Racism, thus defined, is a modern conception, for prior to the XVIth century there was virtually nothing in the life and thought of the West that can be described as racist. To prevent misunderstanding a clear distinction must be made between racism and [[ethnocentrism]]&amp;nbsp;... The Ancient [[Hebrews]], in referring to all who were not Hebrews as [[Gentile]]s, were indulging in ethnocentrism, not in racism. ... So it was with the [[Greeks|Hellenes]] who denominated all non-Hellenes—whether the wild [[Scythians]] or the [[Egyptians]] whom they acknowledged as their mentors in the arts of [[civilization]]—Barbarians, the term denoting that which was strange or foreign.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The legacy Catholic [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] then formulated the ''[[limpieza de sangre]]'' ("cleanliness of blood") doctrine. It was during this time in history that the Western concept of aristocratic "[[Nobility#"Blue" blood|blue blood]]" emerged in a racialized, religious and feudal context,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://pachami.com/Inquisicion/LimpiezaSangre.html |title=Limpieza de Sangre |language=es |trans-title=Cleanliness of blood |last=A.

Robert Lacey explains:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Lacey |title=Aristocrats |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |date=1983 |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was the Spaniards who gave the world the notion that an aristocrat's blood is not red but blue. The Spanish nobility started taking shape around the ninth century in classic military fashion, occupying land as warriors on horseback. They were to continue the process for more than five hundred years, clawing back sections of the peninsula from its Moorish occupiers, and a nobleman demonstrated his pedigree by holding up his sword arm to display the filigree of blue-blooded veins beneath his pale skin—proof that his birth had not been contaminated by the dark-skinned enemy. Sangre azul, blue blood, was thus a euphemism for being a [[white people|white]] man—Spain's own particular reminder that the refined footsteps of the aristocracy through history carry the rather less refined spoor of racism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the expulsion of the Arabic [[Moors]] and most of the [[Sephardic Jews]] from the [[Iberian peninsula]], the remaining [[Jews]] and [[Muslim]]s were forced to [[Converso|convert]] to Roman Catholicism, becoming "[[New Christian]]s", who were sometimes discriminated against by the "[[Old Christian]]s" in some cities (including [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]), despite condemnations by the Church and the State, which both welcomed the new flock.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[Inquisition]] was carried out by members of the [[Dominican Order]] in order to weed out the converts who still practiced [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]] in secret. The system and ideology of the ''limpieza de sangre'' ostracized false Christian converts from society in order to protect it against [[treason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Los estatutos de Limpieza de Sangre |language=es |trans-title= |page=121 |last=Sicroff |first=Albert A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remnants of such legislation persevered into the 19th century in military contexts.&lt;ref&gt;''Colección Legislativa de España'' (1870), p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Portugal]], the legal distinction between New and Old Christian was only ended through a legal decree issued by the [[Marquis of Pombal]] in 1772, almost three centuries after the implementation of the racist discrimination. The ''limpieza de sangre'' legislation was common also during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonization of the Americas]], where it led to the racial and feudal separation of peoples and social strata in the colonies.

At the end of the [[Spanish Renaissance|Renaissance]], the [[Valladolid debate]] (1550–1551), concerning the treatment of the [[Indigenous people of the Americas|natives]] of the "[[New World]]" pitted the Dominican friar and Bishop of Chiapas, [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]], to another Dominican and Humanist [[philosophy|philosopher]], [[Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda]]. The latter argued that the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] practiced [[human sacrifice]] of innocents, [[Human cannibalism|cannibalism]], and other such "crimes against nature"; they were unacceptable and should be suppressed by any means possible including war,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tratado sobre las Justas Causas de la Guerra contra los Indios|publisher=Fondo de Cultura Económica|year=1941|location=Mexico D.F.|page=155|author=Ginés de Sepúlveda, Juan (trans.

To the contrary, Bartolomé de Las Casas argued that the Amerindians were free men in the natural order and deserved the same treatment as others, according to [[Catholic theology]].

===Racism as a modern phenomenon===
Racism is frequently described as a ''modern'' phenomenon. In the view of the French philosopher and historian [[Michel Foucault]], the first formulation of racism emerged in the [[Early modern Europe|Early Modern period]] as the "[[discourse]] of race struggle", and a historical and political discourse, which Foucault opposed to the philosophical and juridical discourse of [[sovereignty]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, ''Society Must Be Defended'' (1976–77)&lt;/ref&gt;

This European discourse, which first appeared in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], was then carried on in [[France]] by such people as [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]] (1658–1722), [[Nicolas Fréret]] (1688–1749), and then, during the 1789 [[French Revolution]], [[Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès|Sieyès]], and afterwards, [[Augustin Thierry]] and [[Antoine Augustin Cournot|Cournot]]. Boulainvilliers, who created the matrix of such racist discourse in France, conceived of the "race" as being something closer to the sense of a "nation", that is, in his time, the "race" meant the "people".

He conceived of France as being divided between various nations—the unified [[nation-state]] is an [[anachronism]] here—which themselves formed different "races". Boulainvilliers opposed the [[absolute monarchy]], which tried to bypass the [[aristocracy]] by establishing a direct relationship to the [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]]. Thus, he developed the theory that the French aristocrats were the descendants of foreign invaders, whom he called the "[[Franks]]", while according to him, the Third Estate constituted the autochthonous, vanquished [[Gallo-Romans]], who were dominated by the Frankish aristocracy as a consequence of the [[right of conquest]]. Early modern racism was opposed to nationalism and the nation-state: the [[François Dominique de Reynaud de Montlosier|Comte de Montlosier]], in exile during the [[French Revolution]], who borrowed Boulainvilliers' discourse on the "Nordic race" as being the French aristocracy that invaded the plebeian "Gauls", thus showed his contempt for the Third Estate, calling it "this new people born of slaves&amp;nbsp;... [[miscegenation|mixture of all races and of all times]]".

===19th century===
[[File:Advert for Pears' Soap Wellcome L0030380.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for [[Pears (soap)|Pears' Soap]] Caption reads, "Matchless for the complexion..." Illustration of 'before and after' use of soap by black child in the bath; soap washes off his dark complexion.]]

While 19th-century racism became closely intertwined with nationalism,&lt;ref&gt;Academic Press (2000). [https://books.google.com/books?id=pvHRNNk9hHEC&amp;q=racism+and+ethnic+nationalism+in+the+19th+century%2C%2F&amp;pg=PA435 " Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Two-Volume Set, Volume 2"].&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the [[ethnic nationalist]] discourse that identified the "race" with the "[[Volk (German word)|folk]]", leading to such movements as [[pan-Germanism]], [[pan-Turkism]], [[pan-Arabism]], and [[pan-Slavism]], medieval racism precisely divided the nation into various non-biological "races", which were thought to be the consequence of historical conquests and [[social conflict]]s. Michel Foucault traced the genealogy of modern racism to this medieval "historical and political discourse of race struggle". According to him, it divided itself in the 19th century according to two rival lines: on one hand, it was incorporated by racists, biologists and [[eugenicists]], who gave it the modern sense of "race", and they also transformed this popular discourse into a "[[state racism]]" (e.g., Nazism). On the other hand, [[Marxists|Marxism]] also seized this discourse founded on the assumption of a political struggle that provided the real [[philosophy of history|engine of history]] and continued to act underneath the apparent peace. Thus, Marxists transformed the [[essentialist]] notion of "race" into the historical notion of "[[class struggle]]", defined by socially structured positions: capitalist or proletarian. In ''[[The Will to Knowledge]]'' (1976), Foucault analyzed another opponent of the "race struggle" discourse: [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]], which opposed the concept of "blood [[heredity]]", prevalent in the 19th century racist discourse.

Authors such as [[Hannah Arendt]], in her 1951 book ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', have said that the racist ideology (''popular racism'') which developed at the end of the 19th century helped legitimize the [[New Imperialism|imperialist conquests]] of foreign territories and the atrocities that sometimes accompanied them (such as the [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide]] of 1904–1907 or the [[Armenian genocide]] of 1915–1917). [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem, ''[[The White Man's Burden]]'' (1899), is one of the more famous illustrations of the belief in the inherent superiority of the [[Western culture|European culture]] over the rest of the world, though it is also thought to be a satirical appraisal of such imperialism. Racist ideology thus helped legitimize the conquest and incorporation of foreign territories into an empire, which were regarded as a humanitarian obligation partially as a result of these racist beliefs.

However, during the 19th century, Western European colonial powers were involved in the suppression of the [[Arab slave trade]] in Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server?show=nav.5938&amp;outputFormat=print |title=Royal Navy and the Slave Trade : Battles : History |publisher=Royal-navy.mod.uk |access-date=23 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510210721/http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server?show=nav.5938&amp;outputFormat=print |archive-date=10 May 2011 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the suppression of the [[History of slavery|slave trade]] in West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/visit_see_victory_cfexhibition_infosheet.htm |title=Chasing Freedom Exhibition: the Royal Navy and the Suppression of the Transatlantic Slave Trade |publisher=Royalnavalmuseum.org |date=21 November 2006 |access-date=23 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210021701/http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/visit_see_victory_cfexhibition_infosheet.htm |archive-date=10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Europeans during the time period objected to injustices that occurred in some colonies and lobbied on behalf of [[aboriginal peoples]]. Thus, when the [[Saartjie Baartman|Hottentot Venus]] was displayed in England in the beginning of the 19th century, the African Association publicly opposed itself to the exhibition. The same year that Kipling published his poem, [[Joseph Conrad]] published ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899), a clear criticism of the [[Congo Free State]], which was owned by [[Leopold II of Belgium]].

Examples of racial theories used include the creation of the [[Hamites|Hamitic theory]] during the [[European exploration of Africa]]. The term ''Hamite'' was applied to different populations within North Africa, mainly comprising Ethiopians, [[Demographics of Eritrea|Eritreans]], [[Somali people|Somalis]], [[Berber people|Berbers]], and the ancient Egyptians. Hamites were regarded as Caucasoid peoples who probably originated in either Arabia or Asia on the basis of their cultural, physical and linguistic similarities with the peoples of those areas.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald James Harrison, ''Africa and the Islands'', (Wiley: 1965), p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Dodge, ''African Politics in Perspective'', (Van Nostrand: 1966), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Senior, ''Tropical Lands: a human geography'', (Longman: 1979), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Europeans considered Hamites to be more civilized than [[Black people|Sub-Saharan Africans]], and more akin to themselves and [[Semitic peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;A.H.M. Jones, [[Elizabeth Monroe (historian)|Elizabeth Monroe]], ''History of Abyssinia'', (Kessinger Publishing: 2003), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; In the first two-thirds of the 20th century, the Hamitic race was, in fact, considered one of the branches of the [[Caucasian race]], along with the [[Aryan race|Indo-Europeans]], [[Semitic people|Semites]], and the [[Mediterranean race|Mediterraneans]].

However, the Hamitic peoples themselves were often deemed to have failed as rulers, which was usually ascribed to [[miscegenation|interbreeding]] with [[Negroe]]s. In the mid-20th century, the German scholar [[Carl Meinhof]] (1857–1944) claimed that the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] race was formed by a merger of [[Hamitic]] and [[Negroid|Negro]] races. The Hottentots ([[Nama people|Nama]] or [[Khoi]]) were formed by the merger of Hamitic and [[Bushmen]] (San) races—both being termed nowadays as [[Khoisan]] peoples.

It was desirable, therefore, as it respected them, and the residue of the population of the country, to drain them off".&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Montesinos Sale (1997). ''The Slumbering Volcano: American Slave Ship Revolts and the Production of Rebellious Masculinity''. p. 264. [[Duke University Press]], 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Racism spread throughout the New World in the late 19th century and early 20th century. [[Whitecapping]], which started in Indiana in the late 19th century, soon spread throughout all of North America, causing many African laborers to flee from the land they worked on. In the US, during the 1860s, racist posters were used during election campaigns. In one of these racist posters (see above), a black man is depicted lounging idly in the foreground as one white man ploughs his field and another chops wood. Accompanying labels are: "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread", and "The white man must work to keep his children and pay his taxes." The black man wonders, "Whar is de use for me to work as long as dey make dese appropriations." Above in a cloud is an image of the "Freedman's Bureau! Negro Estimate of Freedom!" The bureau is pictured as a large domed building resembling the U.S. Capitol and is inscribed "Freedom and No Work". Its columns and walls are labeled, "Candy", "Rum, Gin, Whiskey", "Sugar Plums", "Indolence", "White Women", "Apathy", "White Sugar", "Idleness", and so on.

On 5 June 1873, Sir [[Francis Galton]], distinguished English explorer and cousin of Charles Darwin, wrote in a letter to ''[[The Times]]'':

The Nazi party, which seized power in the [[German federal election, March 1933|1933 German elections]] and maintained a dictatorship over much of Europe until the [[End of World War II in Europe|End of World War II on the European continent]], deemed the Germans to be part of an Aryan "[[master race]]" (''Herrenvolk''), who therefore had the right to expand their territory and enslave or kill members of other races deemed inferior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070727021822/http://www.atsweb.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |archive-date=27 July 2007 |title=Hitler's Plans for Eastern Europe |website=Poland under Nazi Occupation |first1=Janusz |last1=Gumkowski |first2=Kazimierz |last2=Leszczynski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The racial ideology conceived by the Nazis graded humans on a scale of pure Aryan to non-Aryan, with the latter viewed as subhuman. At the top of the scale of pure Aryans were Germans and other Germanic peoples including the Dutch, Scandinavians, and the [[English people|English]] as well as other peoples such as some northern Italians and the French, who were said to have a suitable admixture of Germanic blood.&lt;ref name="Davies06"&gt;[[Norman Davies|Davies, Norman]] (2006).

==Scientific racism==
{{Main|Scientific racism}}{{Further|Unilineal evolution}}
[[File:Races and skulls.png|thumb|upright|Drawings from [[Josiah C. Nott]] and [[George Gliddon]]'s ''Indigenous races of the earth'' (1857), which suggested [[black people]] ranked between [[white people]] and chimpanzees in terms of intelligence]]

The modern biological definition of race developed in the 19th century with scientific racist theories. The term ''scientific racism'' refers to the use of science to justify and support racist beliefs, which goes back to the early 18th century, though it gained most of its influence in the mid-19th century, during the [[New Imperialism]] period. Also known as academic racism, such theories first needed to overcome the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]]'s resistance to [[positivism|positivist]] accounts of history and its support of [[monogenism]], the concept that all human beings were originated from the same ancestors, in accordance with [[creationist]] accounts of history.

These racist theories put forth on scientific hypothesis were combined with [[unilineal evolution|unilineal theories of social progress]], which postulated the superiority of the European civilization over the rest of the world. Furthermore, they frequently made use of the idea of "[[survival of the fittest]]", a term coined by [[Herbert Spencer]] in 1864, associated with ideas of competition, which were named [[social Darwinism]] in the 1940s. [[Charles Darwin]] himself opposed the idea of rigid racial differences in ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' (1871), in which he argued that humans were all of one species, sharing common descent. He recognised racial differences as varieties of humanity, and emphasised the close similarities between people of all races in mental faculties, tastes, dispositions and habits, while still contrasting the culture of the "lowest savages" with European civilization.&lt;ref name="dom"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=245 |title=The descent of man, and selection in relation to sex |access-date=2 December 2007 |first=Charles |last=Darwin |author-link=Charles Darwin |year=1871 |publisher=John Murray |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014528/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=245 |archive-date=30 September 2007 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Desmond |first1=Adrian |author1-link=Adrian Desmond |first2=James Richard |last2=Moore |author2-link=James Moore (biographer) |title=Darwin |year=1991 |publisher=Michael Joseph, Penguin Group |isbn=978-0-7181-3430-3 |oclc=185764721 |pages=28, 147, 580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 19th century, proponents of scientific racism intertwined themselves with [[eugenics]] discourses of "[[Social degeneration|degeneration]] of the race" and "blood [[heredity]]".{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Henceforth, scientific racist discourses could be defined as the combination of polygenism, unilinealism, social Darwinism, and eugenism. They found their scientific legitimacy on [[physical anthropology]], [[anthropometry]], [[craniometry]], [[phrenology]], [[physiognomy]], and others now discredited disciplines in order to formulate racist prejudices.

Before being disqualified in the 20th century by the American school of [[cultural anthropology]] ([[Franz Boas]], etc.), the British school of [[social anthropology]] ([[Bronisław Malinowski]], [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]], etc.), the French school of [[ethnology]] ([[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], etc.), as well as the discovery of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|neo-Darwinian synthesis]], such sciences, in particular anthropometry, were used to deduce behaviours and psychological characteristics from outward, physical appearances.

The neo-Darwinian synthesis, first developed in the 1930s, eventually led to a [[gene-centered view of evolution]] in the 1960s. According to the [[Human Genome Project]], the most complete mapping of human DNA to date indicates that there is no clear [[Race and genetics|genetic basis to racial groups]]. While some genes are more common in certain populations, there are no genes that exist in all members of one population and no members of any other.&lt;ref name="ornl"&gt;{{cite web |title=Minorities, Race, and Genomics |url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/minorities.shtml |access-date=12 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heredity and eugenics===
{{Further|Eugenics}}

The first theory of [[eugenics]] was developed in 1869 by [[Francis Galton]] (1822–1911), who used the then-popular concept of ''[[Social degeneration|degeneration]]''. He applied [[statistics]] to study human differences and the alleged "[[inheritance of intelligence]]", foreshadowing future uses of "[[intelligence testing]]" by the anthropometry school. Such theories were vividly described by the writer [[Émile Zola]] (1840–1902), who started publishing in 1871, a twenty-novel cycle, ''[[Les Rougon-Macquart]]'', where he linked [[heredity]] to behavior. Thus, Zola described the high-born Rougons as those involved in politics (''[[Son Excellence Eugène Rougon]]'') and medicine (''[[Le Docteur Pascal]]'') and the low-born Macquarts as those fatally falling into [[alcoholism]] (''[[L'Assommoir]]''), [[prostitution]] (''[[Nana (novel)|Nana]]''), and [[homicide]] (''[[La Bête humaine]]'').

During the rise of [[Nazi Germany|Nazism in Germany]], some scientists in Western nations worked to debunk the regime's racial theories. A few argued against racist ideologies and discrimination, even if they believed in the alleged existence of biological races. However, in the fields of anthropology and biology, these were minority positions until the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[UNESCO]], ''[[The Race Question]]'', 1950&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 1950 UNESCO statement, ''[[The Race Question]]'', an international project to debunk racist theories had been attempted in the mid-1930s. However, this project had been abandoned. Thus, in 1950, UNESCO declared that it had resumed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...up again, after a lapse of fifteen years, a project that the [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]] has wished to carry through but that it had to abandon in deference to the [[Appeasement of Hitler|appeasement policy]] of the pre-war period. The race question had become one of the pivots of [[Nazi ideology]] and policy. [[Tomáš Masaryk|Masaryk]] and [[Edvard Beneš|Beneš]] took the initiative of calling for a conference to re-establish in the minds and consciences of men everywhere the truth about race&amp;nbsp;... Nazi propaganda was able to continue its baleful work unopposed by the authority of an international organisation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Third Reich's racial policies]], its [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics programs]] and the extermination of Jews in [[the Holocaust]], as well as the [[Romani people]] in the [[Porrajmos]] (the [[Porajmos|Romani Holocaust]]) and others minorities led to a change in opinions about scientific research into race after the war.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Changes within scientific disciplines, such as the rise of the [[Franz Boas|Boasian]] school of anthropology in the United States contributed to this shift. These theories were strongly denounced in the 1950 UNESCO statement, signed by internationally renowned scholars, and titled ''[[The Race Question]]''.

===Polygenism and racial typologies===
{{Further|Polygenism |Typology (anthropology)|Nordicism}}
[[File:Passing of the Great Race - Map 4.jpg|thumb|Madison Grant's map, from 1916, charting the "present distribution of European races", with the [[Nordic race|Nordics]] in red, the [[Alpine race|Alpines]] in green, and the [[Mediterranean race|Mediterraneans]] in yellow]]

Works such as [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853–1855) may be considered one of the first theorizations of this new racism, founded on an essentialist notion of race, which opposed the former racial discourse, of [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]] for example, which saw in races a fundamentally historical reality, which changed over time. Gobineau, thus, attempted to frame racism within the terms of biological differences among humans, giving it the legitimacy of [[biology]].

Gobineau's theories would be expanded in France by [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] (1854–1936)'s [[typology (anthropology)|typology of races]], who published in 1899 ''The Aryan and his Social Role'', in which he claimed that the white "[[Aryan]] race" "[[Cephalic index|dolichocephalic]]", was opposed to the "brachycephalic" race, of whom the "[[Jew]]" was the archetype. Vacher de Lapouge thus created a [[hierarchical classification]] of races, in which he identified the "''[[Nordic race|Homo europaeus]]'' (Teutonic, Protestant, etc.), the "''[[Homo alpinus]]''" ([[Auvergne (province)|Auvergnat]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]], etc.), and finally the "''[[Homo mediterraneus]]''" ([[Naples|Neapolitan]], [[Andalusia|Andalus]], etc.) He assimilated races and [[social class]]es, considering that the French upper class was a representation of the ''Homo europaeus'', while the lower class represented the ''Homo alpinus''. Applying Galton's eugenics to his theory of races, Vacher de Lapouge's "selectionism" aimed first at achieving the annihilation of [[trade union]]ists, considered to be a "degenerate"; second, creating types of man each destined to one end, in order to prevent any contestation of [[labour condition]]s. His "anthroposociology" thus aimed at blocking [[social conflict]] by establishing a fixed, hierarchical social order.&lt;ref&gt;Matsuo Takeshi ([[Shimane Prefecture|University of Shimane]], Japan). ''L'Anthropologie de Georges Vacher de Lapouge: Race, classe et eugénisme'' (Georges Vacher de Lapouge anthropology) in ''{{ill|Japanese Society for French Literature|lt=Studies in French Language and Literature|jp|日本フランス語フランス文学会}}'' 2001, n°79, pp. 47–57. {{ISSN|0425-4929}}; [[INIST]]-[[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]], Cote INIST : 25320, 35400010021625.0050 ([http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=13473405 Abstract resume on the INIST-CNRS])&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, [[William Z. Ripley]] used identical racial classification in ''[[The Races of Europe (Ripley)|The Races of Europe]]'' (1899), which would have a great influence in the United States. Other scientific authors include [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain|H.S. Chamberlain]] at the end of the 19th century (a British citizen who [[naturalization|naturalized]] himself as German because of his admiration for the "Aryan race") and [[Madison Grant]], a eugenicist and author of ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' (1916). Madison Grant provided statistics for the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], which severely restricted immigration of Jews, [[Slavs]], and Southern Europeans, who were subsequently hindered in seeking to escape Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The funding of scientific racism: Wickliffe Draper and the Pioneer Fund |last=Tucker |first=William H. |author-link=William H.

Evolutionary psychologists [[John Tooby]] and [[Leda Cosmides]] were puzzled by the fact that in the US, race is one of the three characteristics most often used in brief descriptions of individuals (the others are age and sex). They reasoned that [[natural selection]] would not have favoured the evolution of an instinct for using race as a classification, because for most of human history, humans almost never encountered members of other races. Tooby and Cosmides hypothesized that modern people use race as a proxy (rough-and-ready indicator) for coalition membership, since a better-than-random guess about "which side" another person is on will be helpful if one does not actually know in advance.

Their colleague [[Robert Kurzban]] designed an experiment whose results appeared to support this hypothesis. Using the [[memory confusion protocol]], they presented subjects with pictures of individuals and sentences, allegedly spoken by these individuals, which presented two sides of a debate. The errors that the subjects made in recalling who said what indicated that they sometimes mis-attributed a statement to a speaker of the same race as the "correct" speaker, although they also sometimes mis-attributed a statement to a speaker "on the same side" as the "correct" speaker. In a second run of the experiment, the team also distinguished the "sides" in the debate by clothing of similar colors; and in this case the effect of racial similarity in causing mistakes almost vanished, being replaced by the color of their clothing. In other words, the first group of subjects, with no clues from clothing, used race as a visual guide to guessing who was on which side of the debate; the second group of subjects used the clothing color as their main visual clue, and the effect of race became very small.&lt;ref name="KurzbanToobyCosmides2001ErasingRace"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Can race be erased?

Some research suggests that ethnocentric thinking may have actually contributed to the development of cooperation. Political scientists Ross Hammond and Robert Axelrod created a computer simulation wherein virtual individuals were randomly assigned one of a variety of skin colors, and then one of a variety of trading strategies: be color-blind, favor those of your own color, or favor those of other colors. They found that the ethnocentric individuals clustered together, then grew, until all the non-ethnocentric individuals were wiped out.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Scientist]]''. Issue 2595, 17 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] writes that "Blood-feuds and inter-clan warfare are easily interpretable in terms of [[W. D. Hamilton|Hamilton]]'s [[kin selection|genetic theory]]." Dawkins writes that racial prejudice, while not evolutionarily adaptive, "could be interpreted as an irrational generalization of a kin-selected tendency to identify with individuals physically resembling oneself, and to be nasty to individuals different in appearance."&lt;ref name="Dawkins2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |author-link=Richard Dawkins |title=The selfish gene |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EJeHTt8hW7UC&amp;pg=PA99 |year=2006 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-929115-1 |page=99 |via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simulation-based experiments in [[evolutionary game theory]] have attempted to provide an explanation for the selection of ethnocentric-strategy phenotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/0022002706293470 |last1=Hammond |first1=R.

Despite support for evolutionary theories relating to an innate origin of racism, various studies have suggested racism is associated with lower intelligence and less diverse peer groups during childhood. A neuroimaging study on amygdala activity during racial matching activities found increased activity to be associated with adolescent age as well as less racially diverse peer groups, which the author conclude suggest a learned aspect of racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Telzer |first1=Eva |last2=Humphreys |first2=Kathryn |last3=Mor |first3=Shapiro |last4=Tottenham |first4=Nim |author4-link=Nim Tottenham |title=Amygdala Sensitivity to Race Is Not Present in Childhood but Emerges over Adolescence |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=234–244 |doi=10.1162/jocn_a_00311 |pmid=23066731 |year=2013 |pmc=3628780}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies found amygdala activity correlated to increased scores on implicit measures of racial bias.

A 2017 study in the ''American Political Science Review'' found that prejudice towards marginalized groups, such as refugees, could be explained by a failure to take the perspective of the marginalized group.&lt;ref name="Simonovits"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Simonovits |first1=Gábor |last2=Kézdi |first2=Gábor |last3=Kardos |first3=Péter |date=2017 |title=Seeing the World Through the Other's Eye: An Online Intervention Reducing Ethnic Prejudice |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=112 |pages=186–193 |doi=10.1017/S0003055417000478 |issn=0003-0554 |s2cid=148909505}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that young Hungarian adults who played a perspective-taking game (a game intended to reduce prejudice towards marginalized groups by having players assume the role of a member of a marginalized group) showed reduced prejudice towards Romani people and refugees, as well as reduced their vote intentions for Hungary's overtly racist, far right party by 10%.&lt;ref name="Simonovits" /&gt;

[[State racism]]—the institutions and practices of a nation-state that are grounded in racist ideology—has played a major role in all instances of [[settler colonialism]], from the United States to Australia.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}} It also played a prominent role in the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] regime, in [[Fascism|fascist]] regimes throughout Europe, and during the early years of Japan's [[Shōwa period]]. These governments advocated and implemented ideologies and policies that were racist, xenophobic, and, in the case of [[Nazism]], genocidal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Edward |last=Russel |title=The Knights of Bushido |date=2002 |page=238}}; {{cite book |last=Bix |first=Herbert |author-link=Herbert Bix |title=[[Hirohito and the making of modern Japan]] |date=2001 |pages=313–314, 326, 359–360}}; {{cite book |last=Wolferen |first=Karel van |author-link=Karel van Wolferen |title=The Enigma of Japanese Power |date=1989 |pages=263–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Paulino |first1=Edward |title=Anti-Haitianism, Historical Memory, and the Potential for Genocidal Violence in the Dominican Republic |journal=[[Genocide Studies International]] |date=December 2006 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=265–288 |doi=10.3138/7864-3362-3R24-6231 |issn=2291-1847 |eissn=2291-1855 |url=https://scholarcommons.usf.edu/gsp/vol1/iss3/5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg Race Laws]] of 1935 prohibited sexual relations between any Aryan and Jew, considering it ''[[Rassenschande]]'', "racial pollution". The Nuremberg Laws stripped all Jews, even quarter- and half-Jews (second and first degree ''Mischlings''), of their German citizenship. This meant that they had no basic citizens' rights, e.g., the [[the right to vote|right to vote]]. In 1936, Jews were banned from all professional jobs, effectively preventing them from having any influence in education, politics, higher education, and industry. On 15 November 1938, Jewish children were banned from going to normal schools. By April 1939, nearly all Jewish companies had either collapsed under financial pressure and declining profits, or had been persuaded to sell out to the Nazi government. This further reduced their rights as human beings; they were in many ways officially separated from the German populace. Similar laws existed in Bulgaria ([[Law for protection of the nation|The Law for protection of the nation]]), Hungary, Romania, and Austria.

Legislative state racism is known to have been enforced by the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] of South Africa during its [[Apartheid]] regime between 1948 and 1994. Here, a series of [[Apartheid legislation in South Africa|Apartheid legislation]] was passed through the legal systems to make it legal for white South Africans to have rights which were superior to those of non-white South Africans. Non-white South Africans were not allowed involvement in any governing matters, including voting; access to quality healthcare; the provision of basic services, including clean water; electricity; as well as access to adequate schooling. Non-white South Africans were also prevented from accessing certain public areas, from using certain public transportation, and were required to live only in certain designated areas. Non-white South Africans were taxed differently than white South Africans and they were also required to carry on them at all times additional documentation, which later became known as "dom passes", to certify their non-white South African citizenship. All of these legislative racial laws were abolished through a series of equal [[human rights]] laws which were passed at the end of the Apartheid era in the early 1990s.

Anti-racism includes beliefs, actions, scholarship, [[Political movement|movements]], and [[Public policy|policies]] which are adopted or developed in order to oppose racism. In general, it promotes an egalitarian society in which people are not discriminated against on the basis of race. Examples of anti-racist movements include the [[civil rights movement]], the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] and [[Black Lives Matter]]. [[Socialist]] groups have also been closely aligned with a number of anti-racist organizations such as [[Anti-Nazi League]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Høgsbjerg |first1=Christian |title=Trotskyology: A review of John Kelly, Contemporary Trotskyism: Parties, Sects and Social Movements in Britain |journal=International Socialism |date=18 October 2018 |issue=160 |url=https://isj.org.uk/trotskyology/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240525203955/https://isj.org.uk/trotskyology/ |archive-date=25 May 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Unite Against Fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Platt |first1=Edward |title=Comrades at war: the decline and fall of the Socialist Workers Party |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/uncategorized/2014/05/comrades-war-decline-and-fall-socialist-workers-party |magazine=[[New Statesman]] |date=20 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240630024250/https://www.newstatesman.com/uncategorized/2014/05/comrades-war-decline-and-fall-socialist-workers-party |archive-date=30 June 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nonviolent resistance]] is sometimes embraced as an element of anti-racist movements, although this was not always the case. [[Hate crime]] laws, [[affirmative action]], and bans on racist speech are also examples of government policy which is intended to suppress racism.
