'''Racism''' is generally defined as actions, practices, or beliefs that consider the human species to be divided into [[Race (classification of humans)|races]] with shared traits, abilities, or qualities, such as personality, intellect, morality, or other cultural behavioral characteristics, and especially the belief that races can be ranked as inherently [[Supremacism|superior]] or inferior to others, or that members of different races should be treated differently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/racism Racism] Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schaefer"&gt;"Racism" in R. Schaefer. 2008 Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity and Society. SAGE. p. 1113&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact definition of racism is controversial both because there is little scholarly agreement about the meaning of the concept "race", and because there is also little agreement about what does and does not constitute discrimination. Critics argue that the term is applied differentially, with a focus on such prejudices by whites, and defining mere observations of racial differences as racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Racism : a global reader | first1 = Kevin | last1 = Reilly | first2 = Stephen | last2 = Kaufman | first3 = Angela | last3 = Bodino | year = 2003 | publisher = M.E. Sharpe | location = Armonk, N.Y | isbn = 978-0-7656-1060-7 | pages = 5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some definitions would have it that any assumption that a person's behavior would be influenced by their racial categorization is racist, regardless of whether the action is intentionally harmful or pejorative. Other definitions only include consciously malignant forms of discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Racism : a global reader | first1 = Kevin | last1 = Reilly | first2 = Stephen | last2 = Kaufman | first3 = Angela | last3 = Bodino | year = 2003 | publisher = M.E. Sharpe | location = Armonk, N.Y | isbn = 978-0-7656-1060-7 | pages = 15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the questions about how to define racism are the question of whether to include forms of discrimination that are unintentional, such as making assumptions about preferences or abilities of others based on racial [[stereotype]]s, whether to include [[symbolic racism|symbolic]] or [[Institutional racism|institutionalized forms of discrimination]] such as the circulation of [[ethnic stereotype]]s through the media, and whether to include the socio-political dynamics of [[social stratification]] that sometimes have a racial component. Some definitions of racism also include discriminatory behaviors and beliefs based on cultural, national, ethnic, caste, or religious stereotypes.&lt;ref name="schaefer"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NPR20051112/&gt;

Racism and '''racial discrimination''' are often used to describe discrimination on an ethnic or cultural basis, independent of whether these differences are described as racial. According to the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|convention]], there is no distinction between the terms ''racial discrimination'' and ''[[Ethnic group|ethnic]] discrimination,'' and superiority based on racial differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous, and that there is no justification for racial discrimination, in theory or in practice, anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cerd.htm|title=International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=December 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In history, racism was a driving force behind the [[transatlantic slave trade]], and behind states based on racial segregation such as the [[United States|U.S.]] in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and [[South Africa]] under [[apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Racism : a global reader | first1 = Kevin | last1 = Reilly | first2 = Stephen | last2 = Kaufman | first3 = Angela | last3 = Bodino | year = 2003 | publisher = M.E. Sharpe | location = Armonk, N.Y | isbn = 978-0-7656-1060-7 | pages = 45–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practices and ideologies of racism are universally condemned by the [[United Nations]] in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly, ''Universal Declaration of Human Rights'', 10 December 1948, 217 A (III), available at: [http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/] [accessed 18 July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been a major part of the political and ideological underpinning of genocides such as [[The Holocaust]], but also in colonial contexts such as the [[rubber boom]]s in South America and the Congo, and in the European conquest of the Americas and colonization of [[Colonisation of Africa|Africa]], Asia and Australia.  

==Usage of the term and related terms==
In the 19th century, many scientists subscribed to the simple belief that human populations are divided into separate races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0006636 | title = Racism | accessdate = 2010-07-23 | last = Frideres | first = J.S. | date = 05/2010 | work = The Canadian Encyclopedia | publisher = Canadian Encyclopedia | quote = Racism was developed and popularized by scientists in the 19th century, as they were regarded as purveyors of truth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was often used to justify the belief that some races were inferior to others, and that differential treatment was consequently justified.&lt;ref name="M-W"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racism | title = racism | publisher = Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary | date = 2009-03-16 | accessdate = 2009-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/combating_discrimination/l33178_en.htm|work=Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA of 28 November 2008|publisher=European Union|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cerd.htm|work=UN Treaty Series|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=3 February 2011| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/61DocT4xh | archivedate = 2011-08-26| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such theories are generally termed ''[[scientific racism]]''.  When the practice of treating certain groups preferentially, or denying rights or benefits to certain groups, based on racial characteristics is institutionalized, it is termed “[[institutional racism]]”.

Today, most biologists, anthropologists, and sociologists reject a simple taxonomy of races in favor of more specific and/or empirically verifiable criteria, such as geography, [[Ethnic Group|ethnicity]], or a history of [[endogamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Does Race Exist? | journal = Scientific American | date = 12/2003 | first = Michael | last = Bamshad | coauthors = Steve E. Olson| quote = If races are defined as genetically discrete groups, no. But researchers can use some genetic information to group individuals into clusters with medical relevance.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who subscribe to the proposition that there are inherent distinctions among people that can be ascribed to membership in a racial group (and who may use this to justify differential treatment of such groups) tend to describe themselves using the term “racialism” rather than “racism”, to avoid the negative connotations of the latter word. “Racialism” is assumed to be more [[value-neutral]] [[terminology]], and more appropriate for ([[scientifically]]) [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] communication or analysis.

However, this distribution of meanings between the two terms used to be precisely inverse at the time they were coined: The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defined “racialism” as “belief in the superiority of a particular race” and gives a 1907 quote as the first recorded use. The shortened term “racism” did not appear in the English language until the 1930s.&lt;ref name="rm42"&gt;{{cite book| last = Miles| first = Robert| title = Racism| url = http://books.google.com/?id=J9AOAAAAQAAJ| year = 1989| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-0-415-01809-8| page = 42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The term "racism" was used as the title of a 1930s book, and possibly coined, by [[sexologist]] and homosexual activist [[Magnus Hirschfeld]].&lt;/ref&gt; It was first defined by the ''OED'' as “[t]he theory that distinctive human characteristics and abilities are determined by race”, which gives 1936 as the first recorded use. Additionally, the OED records ''racism'' as a [[synonym]] of ''racialism'': "belief in the superiority of a particular race". By the end of [[World War II]], ''racism'' had acquired the same supremacist connotations formerly associated with ''racialism'': ''racism'' now implied racial discrimination, racial [[supremacism]] and a harmful intent. (The term “race hatred” had also been used by [[sociologist]] [[Frederick Hertz]] in the late 1920s.)

Modeled on the term “racism”, a large number of pejorative ''-ism'' terms have been created to describe various types of prejudice: [[sexism]], [[ageism]], [[ableism]], [[speciesism]], etc. Related concepts are [[antisemitism]], [[chauvinism]] and [[homophobia]] (which in turn has led to terms such as [[Islamophobia]]).

==Definitions==
Racism involves the belief in racial differences, which acts as a justification for non-equal treatment (which some regard as "discrimination")  of members of that race.&lt;ref name="M-W"/&gt;  The term is commonly used negatively and is usually associated with race-based [[prejudice]], [[violence]], [[dislike]], [[discrimination]], or [[oppression]], the term can also have varying and contested definitions. ''[[Racialism (Racial categorization)|Racialism]]'' is a related term, sometimes intended to avoid these negative meanings.

As a word, [[:wiktionary:racism|racism]] is an “-ism”, a belief that can be described by a word ending in the suffix [[:wiktionary:-ism|-ism]], pertaining to [[:wiktionary:race|race]]. As its etymology would suggest, its usage is relatively recent and as such its definition is not entirely settled. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines racism as the “belief that all members of each race possess characteristics, abilities, or qualities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races” and the expression of such prejudice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=racism, n. |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED Online]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=March 2011 |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/157097 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Minorities, Race, and Genomics"&gt;{{cite web|author=marissa mills |url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/minorities.shtml |title=Minorities, Race, and Genomics |publisher=Ornl.gov |date=2007-08-31 |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''[[Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]]'' defines it as a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority or inferiority of a particular racial group, and alternatively that it is also the prejudice based on such a belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=racism |work=[[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |year=2011 |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racism |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Macquarie dictionary|Macquarie Dictionary]]'' defines racism as: "the belief that human races have distinctive characteristics which determine their respective [[culture]]s, usually involving the idea that one’s own race is superior and has the right to rule or dominate others."

===Legal===
The UN does not define “racism”; however, it does define “racial discrimination”: According to the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;''the term "racial discrimination" shall mean any distinction, exclusion, restriction, or preference based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], colour, [[Cultural heritage|descent]], or national or [[ethnicity|ethnic]] origin that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of [[human rights]] and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hri.org/docs/ICERD66.html UN International Convention on the Elimination of All of Racial Discrimination], New York 7 March 1966&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This definition does not make any difference between discrimination based on [[ethnicity]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], in part because the distinction between the two remains debatable among [[Anthropology|anthropologists]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Metraux (1950) "United nations Economic and Security Council Statement by Experts on Problems of Race" in ''American Anthropologist 53(1): 142–145)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in British law the phrase ''racial group'' means "any group of people who are defined by reference to their race, colour, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/prosecution/rrpbcrbook.html |title=Racist and Religious Crime – CPS Prosecution Policy |publisher=The CPS |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociological===
Some [[Sociology|sociologists]] have defined racism as a system of group privilege. In ''Portraits of White Racism'', David Wellman has defined racism as “culturally sanctioned beliefs, which, regardless of intentions involved, defend the advantages whites have because of the subordinated position of racial minorities”.&lt;ref name="Wellman"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wellman | first = David T. | title = Portraits of White Racism | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1993 | location = New York, NY | pages = x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists Noël A. Cazenave and Darlene Alvarez Maddern define racism as “...a highly organized system of 'race'-based group privilege that operates at every level of society and is held together by a sophisticated ideology of color/'race' supremacy. Sellers and Shelton (2003) found that a relationship between racial discrimination and emotional distress was moderated by racial ideology and public regard beliefs. That is, racial centrality appears to promote the degree of discrimination African American young adults perceive whereas racial ideology may buffer the detrimental emotional effects of that discrimination.  Racist systems include, but cannot be reduced to, racial bigotry,”.&lt;ref name="Cazenave"&gt;{{cite book | last = Cazenave | first = Noël A. | coauthors = Darlene Alvarez | title = "Defending the White Race:White Male Faculty Opposition to a White Racism Course" Race and Society 2 | year = 1999 | pages = 25–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist and former [[American Sociological Association]] president [[Joe Feagin]] argues that the [[United States]] can be characterized as a "total racist society"&lt;ref name="Feagin2000"&gt;{{cite book | last = Feagin | first = Joe R. | authorlink = Joe Feagin | title = Racist America: Roots, Current Realities, and Future Reparations | publisher = Routledge | year = 2000 | location = New York, NY | page = 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Police harassment and brutality directed at black men, women, and children are as old as American society, dating back to the days of slavery and Jim Crow segregation. Such police actions across the nation today reveal important aspects of . . . the commonplace discriminatory practices of individual whites . . . [and] white dominated institutions that allow or encourage such practices.."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www-scf.usc.edu/~dtomkins/Assign.html Traditional" American Culture: Benign and Wholesome or Inherently Racist?]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Bank of America wordmark.svg|right|thumb|[[Bank of America]] was fined $335 million in 2011 for minority discrimination.&lt;ref name="america"/&gt;]]
Some sociologists have also pointed out, with reference to the USA and elsewhere, that forms of racism have in many instances mutated from more blatant expressions hereof into more covert kinds (albeit that blatant forms of hatred and discrimination still endure). The “newer” (more hidden and less easily detectable) forms of racism—which can be considered as embedded in social processes and structures—are more difficult to explore as well as challenge. It has been suggested that, while in many countries overt and explicit racism has become increasingly taboo, even in those who display egalitarian explicit attitudes, an implicit or [[aversive racism]] is still maintained subconsciously.

===Xenophobia===
{{Main|Xenophobia}}
Dictionary definitions of ''xenophobia'' include: intense or irrational dislike or fear of people from other countries (Oxford Dictionaries),&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionaries, The world's most trusted dictionaries http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/xenophobia?q=xenophobia, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; unreasonable fear and hatred of strangers or foreigners or of anything that is strange or foreign (Merriam-Webster)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/xenophobia, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Dictionary of Psychology'' defines it  as "a fear of strangers".&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Psychology, Chapman, Dell Publishing, 1975 fifth printing 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Segregationism===
{{Main|Racial segregation}}
Racial segregation is the separation of humans into [[race (classification of human beings)|racial groups]] in daily life. It may apply to activities such as eating in a restaurant, drinking from a water fountain, using a bath room, attending school, going to the movies, or in the rental or purchase of a home.&lt;ref&gt;''Principles to Guide Housing Policy at the Beginning of the Millennium'', Michael Schill &amp; Susan Wachter, [[Cityscape]]&lt;/ref&gt; Segregation is generally outlawed, but may exist through social norms, even when there is no strong individual preference for it, as suggested by [[Thomas Schelling]]'s models of segregation and subsequent work.

==Types==

===Racial discrimination===
Racial discrimination refers to the separation of people through a process of social division into categories not necessarily related to races for purposes of differential treatment. [[Racial segregation]] policies may formalize it, but it is also often exerted without being legalized. Researchers Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan, at the [[University of Chicago]] and [[MIT]] found in a 2004 study that there was widespread discrimination in the workplace against job applicants whose names were merely perceived as “sounding black”. These applicants were 50% less likely than candidates perceived as having “white-sounding names” to receive callbacks for interviews. [[Devah Pager]], a sociologist at [[Princeton University]], sent matched pairs of applicants to apply for jobs in Milwaukee and New York City, finding that black applicants received callbacks or job offers at half the rate of equally qualified whites.&lt;ref&gt;"Discrimination in a Low Wage Labor Market: A Field Experiment," 2009, ''American Sociological Review'', by Devah Pager, Bruce Western, and Bart Bonikowski&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Mark of a Criminal Record," 2003, ''American Journal of Sociology'', by Devah Pager&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, institutions and courts have upheld discrimination against whites when it is done to promote a diverse work or educational environment, even when it was shown to be to the detriment of qualified applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-04-22-scotus-firefighters_N.htm?loc=interstitialskip |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |title=Court tackles racial bias in work promotions |first=Joan |last=Biskupic |authorlink=Joan Biskupic |date=April 22, 2009 |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.udayton.edu/race/04needs/education03.htm |title=The Struggle for Access in Law School Admissions |publisher=Academic.udayton.edu |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The researchers view these results as strong evidence of unconscious biases rooted in the [[United States]]' long history of discrimination (e.g., [[Jim Crow laws]], etc.)&lt;ref&gt;[[Sendhil Mullainathan]] and Marianne Bertrand (2003).

[[Institutional racism]] (also known as structural racism, [[state racism]] or systemic racism) is racial discrimination by governments, corporations, religions, or educational institutions or other large organizations with the power to influence the lives of many individuals. [[Stokely Carmichael]] is credited for coining the phrase ''institutional racism'' in the late 1960s. He defined the term as “the collective failure of an organization to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin”.&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Race, {{PDFlink|Critics have replied that Carmichael's definition glosses over individual responsibility and leaves no room to question whether the members of a group are failing or not meeting standards due not to discrimination but due to their own dysfunctional behaviour and bad choices.

[[Maulana Karenga]] argued that racism constituted the destruction of culture, language, religion and human possibility, and that the effects of racism were “the morally monstrous destruction of human possibility involved redefining African humanity to the world, poisoning past, present and future relations with others who only know us through this stereotyping and thus damaging the truly human relations among peoples.”&lt;ref name="Ethics on Reparations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africawithin.com/karenga/ethics.htm|publisher="[[Ron Karenga]]"|title=Effects on Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Economic===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
Historical economic or social disparity is alleged to be a form of [[discrimination]] caused by past racism and historical reasons, affecting the present generation through deficits in the formal education and kinds of preparation in previous generation, and through primarily unconscious racist attitudes and actions on members of the general population.

A hypothesis embraced by classical economists is that competition in a capitalist economy decreases the impact of discrimination. The thinking behind the hypothesis is that discrimination imposes a cost on the employer, and thus a profit-driven employer will avoid racist hiring policies.
[[File:Boycot Jews april 1 1933.jpeg|thumb|160px|[[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses]], Germany, 1933]]
Although a capitalist economy would avoid discrimination in order to avoid extra cost, this can be avoided in other ways. A capitalist company, for example, may use racist hiring policies as it deviates towards the “cultural norm”. For example, in a predominantly white society, hiring a person of colour into a position of management may then cause disputes, and damage communications between other employers. Thus, the company would be economically put in a deficit because of the discrimination of other companies, as they invoke discrimination and isolate that company. Although this may be a radical, over exaggerated point of view, it portrays how pervasive racism is and how a company may sometimes deviate towards racist hiring policies in order to not be isolated, thus preventing the company from going into an economic deficit.

In 1950, [[UNESCO]] suggested in ''[[The Race Question]]'' —a statement signed by 21 scholars such as [[Ashley Montagu]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Gunnar Myrdal]], [[Julian Huxley]], etc. — to "drop the term ''race'' altogether and instead speak of [[ethnic groups]]". The statement condemned [[scientific racism]] theories that had played a role in the [[Holocaust]]. It aimed both at debunking scientific racist theories, by popularizing modern knowledge concerning "the race question," and morally condemned racism as contrary to the philosophy of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and its assumption of [[Social equality|equal rights]] for all. Along with Myrdal's ''[[An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy]]'' (1944), ''The Race Question'' influenced the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court [[racial segregation in the United States|desegregation]] decision in "[[Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka]]".&lt;ref name="Prins"&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=30431&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html “Toward a World without Evil: Alfred Métraux as UNESCO Anthropologist (1946–1962)”], by [[Harald E.L.

The [[United Nations]] use the definition of racial discrimination laid out in the ''[[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]]'', adopted in 1966:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''… any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, color, descent, or national or ethnic origin that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.''(Part 1 of Article 1 of the U.N.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2001, the [[European Union]] explicitly banned racism, along with many other forms of social discrimination, in the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]], the legal effect of which, if any, would necessarily be limited to [[Institutions of the European Union]]: "Article 21 of the charter prohibits discrimination on any ground such as race, color, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, disability, age or sexual orientation and also discrimination on the grounds of nationality."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lbr.nl/internationaal/charter%20uk.html ] {{Wayback|url=http://www.lbr.nl/internationaal/charter%20uk.html|date =20110724160333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
[[File:Racistcampaignposter1.jpg|thumb|A racist political campaign poster from the 1866 [[Pennsylvania]] [[governor|gubernatorial]] election]]
[[File:DurbanSign1989.jpg|thumb|A sign on a [[racially segregated]] beach during the [[Apartheid in South Africa]]]]

As an ideology, racism existed during the 19th century as "[[scientific racism]]", which attempted to provide a [[typology (anthropology)|racial classification]] of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre-André Taguieff]], ''La force du préjugé'', 1987 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Blumenbach]] in 1775, advocating [[polygenism]], divided the world's population into five groups according to skin colour (Caucasians, Mongols, etc.). The archetypical form of racism is, perhaps, found with the polygenist [[Christoph Meiners]]. He split mankind into two divisions which he labeled the "beautiful White race" and the "ugly Black race". In Meiners book ''The Outline of History of Mankind'' he claimed that a main characteristic of race is either beauty or ugliness. He viewed only the white race as beautiful. He considered ugly races as inferior, immoral and animal like.

[[Anders Retzius]] next disproved that Blumenbach's polygenism had any fundamental merit, in demonstrating that neither Europeans nor different nations are one "pure race", but of mixed origins. While [[Typology (anthropology)#Typology|discredited]], derivations of Blumenbach's taxonomy are [[Definitions of whiteness in the United States|still widely used]] for classification of the population in [[USA]]. [[::dk::Hans Petter Steensby|H. P. Steensby]], while strongly emphasising that all humans today are of mixed origins, in 1907 claimed that the origins of human differences must be traced extraordinarily far back in time, and conjectured that the "purest race" today would be the [[Australian Aboriginals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://img.kb.dk/tidsskriftdk/pdf/gto/gto_0019-PDF/gto_0019_67206.pdf |title=Race Studies in Denmark |journal=Geografisk Tidsskrift |publisher=[[Norwegian Geographical Society]] |volume=19 |language=Danish |date=1907 |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the rejection of [[polygenism]] as well as the widespread racist and nationalist violence of the 1930s and 1940s, scientific racism fell strongly out of favour, but the origins of fundamental human and societal differences are still researched within [[academia]], in fields such as [[human genetics]] including [[paleogenetics]], [[social anthropology]], [[comparative politics]], [[history of religions]], [[history of ideas]], [[prehistory]], [[history]], [[ethics]], and [[psychiatry]]. All reject Meiners' blunt racism. Outside USA, there is widespread rejection of any methodology based on anything similar to Blumenbach's races. It is more unclear to which extent [[ethnic stereotype|ethnic]] and [[nation]]al [[archetype|stereotype]]s are accepted, and when. 

Although racist ideologies have been widely discredited after [[World War II]] and the [[Holocaust]], racism and racial discrimination have remained widespread around the world. Some examples of this in present day are statistics including, but not limited to, the racial breakdown of the prison population versus the national population, physical abilities and mental ability statistics, and other data gathered by scientific groups. While these statistics may be accurate, and can show trends, it's inappropriate in most countries to assume that because a particular race has a high crime or low literacy rate, that the entire race of people are inherent criminals, or inherently unintelligent.

It was already noted by DuBois that, in making the difference between races, it is not race that we think about, but culture:  “...a common history, common laws and religion, similar habits of thought and a conscious striving together for certain ideals of life”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=1119 |title=The Conservation of Races |last=DuBois|first=W. E. B. |year=1897 |page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Late 19th century nationalists were the first to embrace contemporary discourses on "race", ethnicity and "[[survival of the fittest]]" to shape new nationalist doctrines. Ultimately, race came to represent not only the most important traits of the human body, but was also regarded as decisively shaping the character and personality of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Marius Turda| title = The idea of national superiority in Central Europe, 1880-1918| year = 2004| publisher = Edwin Mellen Press| isbn = 978-0-7734-6180-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this view, [[culture]] is the physical manifestation created by ethnic groupings, as such fully determined by racial characteristics. Culture and race became considered intertwined and dependent upon each other, sometimes even to the extent of including nationality or language to the set of definition. Pureness of race tended to be related to rather superficial characteristics that were easily addressed and advertised, such as blondness. Racial qualities tended to be related to nationality and language rather than the actual geographic distribution of racial characteristics. In the case of Nordicism, the denomination "Germanic" became virtually equivalent to superiority of race.

Bolstered by some [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] values and achievements of choice, this concept of racial superiority evolved to distinguish from other cultures, that were considered inferior or impure. This emphasis on culture corresponds to the modern mainstream definition of racism: "Racism does not originate from the existence of ‘races’. It ''creates'' them through a process of social division into categories: anybody can be racialised, independently of their somatic, cultural, religious differences."&lt;ref&gt;National Analytical Study on Racist Violence and Crime, RAXEN Focal Point for ITALY – Annamaria Rivera {{cite web |url=http://fra.europa.eu/fra/material/pub/RAXEN/4/RV/CS-RV-NR-IT.pdf |title=Helping to make fundamental rights a reality for everyone in the European Union |author=FRA |publisher=[[Fundamental Rights Agency|European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights]] |accessdate=22 August 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110717203110/http://fra.europa.eu/fra/material/pub/RAXEN/4/RV/CS-RV-NR-IT.pdf |archivedate = July 17, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition explicitly ignores the biological concept of race, still subject to scientific debate. In the words of [[David C. Rowe]] "A racial concept, although sometimes in the guise of another name, will remain in use in biology and in other fields because scientists, as well as lay persons, are fascinated by human diversity, some of which is captured by race."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Joseph L. Graves| title = The Emperor's new clothes: biological theories of race at the millennium| year = 2001| publisher = Rutgers University Press| isbn = 978-0-8135-2847-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently, this racist abuse of [[Biological anthropology|physical anthropology]] has been politically exploited. Apart from being unscientific, racial prejudice became subject to international legislation. For instance, the [[Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]], adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on November 20, 1963, address racial prejudice explicitly next to discrimination for reasons of race, colour or ethnic origin (Article I).&lt;ref&gt;[http://scm.oas.org/doc_public/ENGLISH/HIST_02/CP09414E07.DOC Inter-American Convention against Racism and all forms of Discrimination and Intolerance – Study prepared by the Inter-American Juridical Committee] 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Racism has been a motivating factor in [[social discrimination]], [[racial segregation]], [[hate speech]] and violence (such as [[pogrom]]s, [[genocide]]s and [[ethnic cleansing]]s). Despite the persistence of racial [[stereotype]]s, humor and epithets in much everyday language, racial discrimination is illegal in many countries.

Ironically, [[anti-racism]] has also become a political instrument of abuse. Some [[politician]]s have practised [[wikt:race baiting|race-baiting]] in an attempt to win votes{{Citation needed|reason=Seems like a tendentious characterization|date=July 2013}}. In a reversal of values, anti-racism is being propagated by [[despotism|despots]] in the service of [[obscurantism]] and the suppression of women. [[New Philosophers|Philosopher]] [[Pascal Bruckner]] claimed that ''"Anti-racism in the UN has become the ideology of totalitarian regimes who use it in their own interests."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.signandsight.com/features/1710.html |title=Boycot Durban II |author=Pascal Bruckner|date=16 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic nationalism===
{{Further|Ethnic nationalism |Romantic nationalism}}
&lt;!-- necessary contextual information for the emergence of ethnic nationalism --&gt;
After the [[Napoleonic War]]s, Europe was confronted with the new "[[nationalities]] question," leading to reconfigurations of the European map, on which the frontiers between the states had been delimited during the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. [[Nationalism]] had made its first appearance with the invention of the ''[[levée en masse]]'' by the [[French Revolution|French revolutionaries]], thus inventing mass [[conscription]] in order to be able to defend the newly founded [[French First Republic|Republic]] against the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' order represented by the European monarchies. This led to the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] (1792–1802) and then to the Napoleonic conquests, and to the subsequent European-wide debates on the concepts and realities of [[nation]]s, and in particular of [[nation-state]]s. The Westphalia Treaty had divided Europe into various empires and kingdoms ([[Ottoman Empire]], [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Swedish Empire]], [[France|Kingdom of France]], etc.), and for centuries wars were waged between princes (''[[Kabinettskriege]]'' in German).

[[File:Eugène Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 030.jpg|thumb|210px|Eugène Delacroix's ''[[The Massacre at Chios|Scene of the massacre at Chios]]'' (1824); Greek families awaiting death or slavery]]
Modern [[nation-state]]s appeared in the wake of the French Revolution, with the formation of [[patriotism|patriotic]] sentiments for the first time in [[Enlightenment Spain|Spain]] during the [[Peninsula War]] (1808–1813 – known in Spain as the Independence War). Despite the restoration of the previous order with the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]], the "nationalities question" became the main problem of Europe during the [[Industrial Era]], leading in particular to the [[1848 Revolutions]], the [[Italian unification]] completed during the 1871 [[Franco-Prussian War]], which itself culminated in the proclamation of the [[German Empire]] in the Hall of Mirrors in the [[Palace of Versailles]], thus achieving the [[German unification]].

Meanwhile, the [[Ottoman Empire]], the "[[sick man of Europe]]", was confronted with endless nationalist movements, which, along with the dissolving of the [[Austrian-Hungarian Empire]], would lead to the creation after [[World War I]] of the various nation-states of the [[Balkan]]s,  with "national [[minorities]]" in their borders.&lt;ref&gt;On this "[[nationalities]] question" and the problem of [[nationalism]], see the relevant articles for a non-exhaustive account of the state of contemporary historical researches; famous works include: [[Ernest Gellner]], ''Nations and Nationalism'' (1983); [[Eric Hobsbawm]],''The Age of Revolution : Europe 1789–1848'' (1962), ''Nations and Nationalism since 1780 : programme, myth, reality'' (1990); [[Benedict Anderson]], ''[[Imagined Communities]]'' (1991); [[Charles Tilly]], ''Coercion, Capital and European States AD 990–1992'' (1990); [[Anthony D. Smith]], ''Theories of Nationalism'' (1971), etc.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ethnic nationalism]], which advocated the belief in a hereditary membership of the nation, made its appearance in the historical context surrounding the creation of the modern nation-states.

One of its main influences was the [[Romantic nationalist]] movement at the turn of the 19th century, represented by figures such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Johann Herder]] (1744–1803), [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Johan Fichte]] (1762–1814) in the ''Addresses to the German Nation'' (1808), [[Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831), or also, in France, [[Jules Michelet]] (1798–1874). It was opposed to [[liberal nationalism]], represented by authors such as [[Ernest Renan]] (1823–1892), who conceived of the nation as a community, which, instead of being based on the ''[[Volk]]'' ethnic group and on a specific, common language, was founded on the subjective will to live together ("the nation is a daily [[plebiscite]]", 1882) or also [[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873).&lt;ref&gt;[[John Stuart Mill]], ''Considerations on Representative Government'', 1861&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Der Stürmer Christmas 1929.jpg|thumb|left|A caricature from the German antisemitic ''[[Der Stürmer]]'', around Christmas 1929. It urged Germans to avoid buying from Jewish shops.]]
Ethnic nationalism blended with scientific racist discourses, as well as with "continental [[imperialist]]" ([[Hannah Arendt]], 1951&lt;ref name="Arendt"&gt;[[Hannah Arendt]], ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' (1951)&lt;/ref&gt;) discourses, for example in the [[pan-Germanism]] discourses, which postulated the racial superiority of the German Volk. The [[Alldeutscher Verband|Pan-German League]] (''Alldeutscher Verband''), created in 1891, promoted [[German colonial empire|German imperialism]], "[[racial hygiene]]" and was opposed to intermarriage with [[Jew]]s. Another popular current, the ''[[Völkisch movement]]'', was also an important proponent of the German ethnic nationalist discourse, which combined with modern [[antisemitism]]. Members of the Völkisch movement, in particular the [[Thule Society]], would participate in the founding of the [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP) in Munich in 1918, the predecessor of the [[NSDAP]] Nazi party. Pan-Germanism and played a decisive role in the [[interwar period]] of the 1920s–1930s.&lt;ref name=Arendt/&gt;

These currents began to associate the idea of the nation with the biological concept of a "[[master race]]" (often the "[[Aryan race]]" or "[[Nordic race]]") issued from the scientific racist discourse. They conflated nationalities with ethnic groups, called "races", in a radical distinction from previous racial discourses that posited the existence of a "race struggle" inside the nation and the state itself. Furthermore, they believed that political boundaries should mirror these alleged racial and ethnic groups, thus justifying [[ethnic cleansing]] in order to achieve "racial purity" and also to achieve ethnic homogeneity in the nation-state.

Such racist discourses, combined with nationalism, were not, however, limited to pan-Germanism. In France, the transition from Republican, liberal nationalism, to ethnic nationalism, which made nationalism a characteristic of [[History of far-right movements in France|far-right movements in France]], took place during the [[Dreyfus Affair]] at the end of the 19th century. During several years, a nation-wide crisis affected French society, concerning the alleged treason of [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a French Jewish military officer. The country polarized itself into two opposite camps, one represented by [[Émile Zola]], who wrote ''[[J'accuse]]'' in defense of Alfred Dreyfus, and the other represented by the nationalist poet, [[Maurice Barrès]] (1862–1923), one of the founders of the ethnic nationalist discourse in France.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Barrès]], ''Le Roman de l'énergie nationale'' (The Novel of National Energy, a trilogy started in 1897)&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[Charles Maurras]] (1868–1952), founder of the monarchist ''[[Action française]]'' movement, theorized the "anti-France," composed of the "four confederate states of Protestants, Jews, Freemasons and foreigners" (his actual word for the latter being the pejorative ''[[Metic|métèques]]'')). Indeed, to him the first three were all “internal foreigners”, who threatened the ethnic unity of the [[French people]].

==Ethnic conflicts==
{{Further|Ethnicity}}
Debates over the origins of racism often suffer from a lack of clarity over the term. Many use the term "racism" to refer to more general phenomena, such as [[xenophobia]] and [[ethnocentrism]], although scholars attempt to clearly distinguish those phenomena from racism as an [[ideology]] or from [[scientific racism]], which has little to do with ordinary xenophobia. Others conflate recent forms of racism with earlier forms of ethnic and national conflict. In most cases, ethno-national conflict seems to owe itself to conflict over land and strategic resources. In some cases, [[ethnicity]] and [[nationalism]] were harnessed to rally [[combatant]]s in wars between great religious empires (for example, the Muslim Turks and the Catholic Austro-Hungarians).
[[File:Morgenthau336.jpg|thumb|Picture showing Armenians killed during the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915.]]
Notions of race and racism often have played central roles in such ethnic conflicts. Throughout history, when an adversary is identified as “other” based on notions of race or ethnicity (in particular when “other” is construed to mean “inferior”), the means employed by the self-presumed “superior” party to appropriate territory, human chattel, or material wealth often have been more ruthless, more brutal, and less constrained by [[morality|moral]] or [[ethics|ethical]] considerations. According to historian Daniel Richter, [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] saw the emergence on both sides of the conflict of "the novel idea that all Native people were 'Indians,' that all Euro-Americans were 'Whites,' and that all on one side must unite to destroy the other." &lt;ref&gt;Richter, ''Facing East from Indian Country'', p.&amp;nbsp;208 &lt;/ref&gt; [[Basil Davidson]] insists in his documentary, ''[[Africa: Different but Equal]]'', that racism, in fact, only just recently surfaced—as late as the 19th century, due to the need for a justification for slavery in the Americas.

The idea of slavery as an "equal-opportunity employer" was denounced with the introduction of Christian theory in the West. Maintaining that Africans were "subhuman" was the only loophole in the then accepted law that "men are created equal" that would allow for the sustenance of the [[Triangular Trade]]. New peoples in the Americas, possible slaves, were encountered, fought, and ultimately subdued, but, then, due to European diseases, their populations drastically decreased. Through both influences, theories about "race" developed, and these helped many to justify the differences in position and treatment of people whom they categorized as belonging to different races (see Eric Wolf's ''Europe and the People without History'').

[[Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda]] argued that, during the [[Valladolid controversy]] in the middle of the 16th century, the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] were natural slaves because they had no ''souls''. In Asia, the [[Qing dynasty|Chinese]] and [[Japanese Empire]]s were both strong colonial powers, with the Chinese making colonies and vassal states of much of East Asia throughout history, and the Japanese doing the same in the 19th–20th centuries. In both cases, the Asian imperial powers believed they were ethnically and racially preferenced too.

[[Owen 'Alik Shahadah]] comments on this racism by stating: "Historically Africans are made to sway like leaves on the wind, impervious and indifferent to any form of civilization, a people absent from scientific discovery, philosophy or the higher arts. We are left to believe that almost nothing can come out of Africa, other than raw material."&lt;ref name="Shahadah"&gt;[http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/agencyandafrica.htm The Removal of Agency from Africa] by [[Owen 'Alik Shahadah]] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5nDq3WjLA|date =2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish philosopher and economist [[David Hume]] said, "I am apt to suspect the Negroes to be naturally inferior to the Whites.

The Negroes are far below them, and at the lowest point are a part of the American people."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Race and Racism (O. R. P.) (Oxford Readings in Philosophy) (Paperback) by [[Bernard Boxill]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, the German philosopher, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], declared that "Africa is no historical part of the world." Hegel further claimed that blacks had no "sense of personality; their spirit sleeps, remains sunk in itself, makes no advance, and thus parallels the compact, undifferentiated mass of the African continent" (''On Blackness Without Blacks: Essays on the Image of the Black in Germany'', Boston: C.W. Hall, 1982, p.&amp;nbsp;94).

Fewer than 30 years before [[Nazi Germany]] instigated [[World War II]], the Austrian, [[Otto Weininger]], claimed: “A genius has perhaps scarcely ever appeared amongst the negroes, and the standard of their morality is almost universally so low that it is beginning to be acknowledged in America that their emancipation was an act of imprudence” (''[[Sex and Character]]'', New York: G.P. Putnam, 1906, p.&amp;nbsp;302).

The German conservative, [[Oswald Spengler]], remarked on what he perceived as the culturally degrading influence of Africans in modern Western culture: in ''The Hour of Decision'' Spengler denounced "the 'happy ending' of an empty existence, the boredom of which has brought to [[jazz]] music and Negro dancing to perform the Death March for a great Culture" (''The Hour of Decision'', pp.&amp;nbsp;227–228). During the Nazi era, German scientists rearranged academia to support claims of a grand "Aryan" agent behind the splendors of all human civilizations, including India and Ancient Egypt.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

===Scientific variants===
{{Main|Scientific racism}} {{Further|Unilineal evolution}}
The modern biological definition of race developed in the 19th century with scientific racist theories. The term ''scientific racism'' refers to the use of science to justify and support racist beliefs, which goes back to the early 18th century, though it gained most of its influence in the mid-19th century, during the [[New Imperialism]] period. Also known as academic racism, such theories first needed to overcome the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]]’s resistance to [[positivism|positivist]] accounts of history and its support of [[monogenism]], the concept that all human beings were originated from the same ancestors, in accordance with [[creationist]] accounts of history.

These racist theories put forth on scientific hypothesis were combined with [[unilineal evolution|unilineal theories of social progress]], which postulated the superiority of the European civilization over the rest of the world. Furthermore, they frequently made use of the idea of "[[survival of the fittest]]", a term coined by [[Herbert Spencer]] in 1864, associated with ideas of competition, which were named [[social Darwinism]] in the 1940s. [[Charles Darwin]] himself opposed the idea of rigid racial differences in ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' (1871) in which he argued that humans were all of one species, sharing common descent. He recognised racial differences as varieties of humanity, and emphasised the close similarities between people of all races in mental faculties, tastes, dispositions and habits, while still contrasting the culture of the "lowest savages" with European civilization.&lt;ref name="dom"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=245 |title=The descent of man, and selection in relation to sex |accessdate=2007-12-02 |author=Charles Darwin |authorlink=Charles Darwin|year=1871 |publisher=John Murray|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930014528/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=245 |archivedate = September 30, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Adrian J.

At the end of the 19th century, proponents of scientific racism intertwined themselves with [[eugenics]] discourses of "[[degeneration]] of the race" and "blood [[heredity]]." Henceforth, scientific racist discourses could be defined as the combination of polygenism, unilinealism, social Darwinism and eugenism. They found their scientific legitimacy on [[physical anthropology]], [[anthropometry]], [[craniometry]], [[phrenology]], [[physiognomy]], and others now discredited disciplines in order to formulate racist prejudices.

Before being disqualified in the 20th century by the American school of [[cultural anthropology]] ([[Franz Boas]], etc.), the British school of [[social anthropology]] ([[Bronisław Malinowski]], [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]], etc.), the French school of [[ethnology]] ([[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], etc.), as well as the discovery of the [[Modern evolutionary synthesis|neo-Darwinian synthesis]], such sciences, in particular anthropometry, were used to deduce behaviours and psychological characteristics from outward, physical appearances.

The neo-Darwinian synthesis, first developed in the 1930s, eventually led to a [[gene-centered view of evolution]] in the 1960s.  According to the [[Human Genome Project]], the most complete mapping of human DNA to date indicates that there is no clear [[Race and genetics|genetic basis to racial groups]]. While some genes are more common in certain populations, there are no genes that exist in all members of one population and no members of any other.&lt;ref name="ornl"&gt;{{cite web | title = Minorities, Race, and Genomics| url = http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/minorities.shtml | accessdate = 2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heredity and eugenics====
{{Further|Eugenics}}
The first theory of [[eugenics]] was developed in 1869 by [[Francis Galton]] (1822–1911), who used the then popular concept of ''[[degeneration]]''. He applied [[statistics]] to study human differences and the alleged "[[inheritance of intelligence]]", foreshadowing future uses of "[[intelligence testing]]" by the anthropometry school. Such theories were vividly described by the writer [[Émile Zola]] (1840–1902), who started publishing in 1871 a twenty-novel cycle, ''[[Les Rougon-Macquart]]'', where he linked [[heredity]] to behavior. Thus, Zola described the high-born Rougons as those involved in politics (''[[Son Excellence Eugène Rougon]]'') and medicine (''[[Le Docteur Pascal]]'') and the low-born Macquarts as those fatally falling into [[alcoholism]] (''[[L'Assommoir]]''), [[prostitution]] (''[[Nana (novel)|Nana]]''), and [[homicide]] (''[[La Bête humaine]]'').

During the rise of [[Nazi Germany|Nazism in Germany]], some scientists in Western nations worked to debunk the regime's racial theories. A few argued against racist ideologies and discrimination, even if they believed in the alleged existence of biological races. However, in the fields of anthropology and biology, these were minority positions until the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[UNESCO]], ''[[The Race Question]]'', 1950&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the 1950 UNESCO statement, ''[[The Race Question]]'', an international project to debunk racist theories had been attempted in the mid-1930s. However, this project had been abandoned. Thus, in 1950, UNESCO declared that it had resumed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''up again, after a lapse of fifteen years, a project that the [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]] has wished to carry through but that it had to abandon in deference to the [[Appeasement of Hitler|appeasement policy]] of the pre-war period. The race question had become one of the pivots of [[Nazi ideology]] and policy. [[Tomáš Masaryk|Masaryk]] and [[Edvard Beneš|Beneš]] took the initiative of calling for a conference to re-establish in the minds and consciences of men everywhere the truth about race... Nazi propaganda was able to continue its baleful work unopposed by the authority of an international organisation.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Third Reich's racial policies]], its [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics programs]] and the extermination of Jews in [[the Holocaust]], as well as [[Romani people]] in the [[Porrajmos]] (the Romani Holocaust) and others minorities led to a change in opinions about scientific research into race after the war. Changes within scientific disciplines, such as the rise of the [[Franz Boas|Boasian]] school of anthropology in the United States contributed to this shift. These theories were strongly denounced in the 1950 UNESCO statement, signed by internationally renowned scholars, and titled ''[[The Race Question]]''.

====Polygenism and racial typologies====
{{Further|Polygenism |Typology (anthropology)}}
[[Image:Passing of the Great Race - Map 4.jpg|right|thumb|Madison Grant's map, from 1916, charting the "present distribution of European races", with the [[Nordic race|Nordics]] in red, the [[Alpine race|Alpines]] in green, and the [[Mediterranean race|Mediterraneans]] in yellow.]]
Works such as [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853–1855) may be considered as one of the first theorizations of this new racism, founded on an essentialist notion of race, which opposed the former racial discourse, of [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]] for example, which saw in races a fundamentally historical reality, which changed over time. Gobineau, thus, attempted to frame racism within the terms of biological differences among humans, giving it the legitimacy of [[biology]]. He was one of the first theorists to postulate [[polygenism]], stating that there were, at the origins of the world, various discrete "races."

Gobineau’s theories would be expanded, in France, by [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] (1854–1936)'s [[typology (anthropology)|typology of races]], who published in 1899 ''The Aryan and his Social Role'', in which he claimed that the white, "[[Aryan]] race", "[[Cephalic index|dolichocephalic]]", was opposed to the "brachycephalic" race, of whom the "[[Jew]]" was the archetype. Vacher de Lapouge thus created a hierarchical classification of races, in which he identified the "''[[Nordic race|Homo europaeus]]'' (Teutonic, Protestant, etc.), the "''[[Homo alpinus]]''" ([[Auvergne (province)|Auvergnat]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]], etc.), and finally the "''[[Homo mediterraneus]]''" ([[Naples|Neapolitan]], [[Andalusia|Andalus]], etc.) He assimilated races and [[social class]]es, considering that the French upper class was a representation of the ''Homo europaeus'', while the lower class represented the ''Homo alpinus''. Applying Galton's eugenics to his theory of races, Vacher de Lapouge's "selectionism" aimed first at achieving the annihilation of [[trade union]]ists, considered to be a "degenerate"; second, creating types of man each destined to one end, in order to prevent any contestation of [[labour condition]]s. His "anthroposociology" thus aimed at blocking [[social conflict]] by establishing a fixed, hierarchical social order&lt;ref&gt;Matsuo Takeshi ([[Shimane Prefecture|University of Shimane]], Japan). ''L'Anthropologie de Georges Vacher de Lapouge: Race, classe et eugénisme'' (Georges Vacher de Lapouge anthropology) in ''[[Études de langue et littérature françaises]]'' 2001, n°79, pp. 47–57.

The same year, [[William Z. Ripley]] used identical racial classification in ''[[The Races of Europe (Ripley)|The Races of Europe]]'' (1899), which would have a great influence in the United States. Other scientific authors include [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain|H.S. Chamberlain]] at the end of the 19th century (a British citizen who [[naturalization|naturalized]] himself as German because of his admiration for the "Aryan race") and [[Madison Grant]], a eugenicist and author of ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' (1916). Madison Grant provided statistics for the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], which severely restricted immigration of Jews, [[Slavs]], and southern Europeans, who were subsequently hindered in seeking to escape Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The funding of scientific racism: Wickliffe Draper and the Pioneer Fund |last=Tucker |first=William H. |authorlink=William H.

====Human zoos====
[[Human zoo]]s (called “People Shows”), were an important means of bolstering ''popular racism'' by connecting it to [[scientific racism]]: they were both objects of public curiosity and of [[anthropology]] and [[anthropometry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://migs.concordia.ca/occpapers/zoo.htm On A Neglected Aspect Of Western Racism], Kurt Jonassohn, December 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Human zoos – Racist theme parks for Europe's colonialists |work=[[Le Monde diplomatique]] |date = August 2000|url=http://mondediplo.com/2000/08/07humanzoo | author=Pascal Blanchard, Sandrine Lemaire and Nicolas Bancel}} {{en icon}}; {{cite news |title=Ces zoos humains de la République coloniale |work=[[Le Monde diplomatique]]  |date=August 2000|url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2000/08/BANCEL/14145.html}} {{fr icon}} (available to everyone)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joice Heth]], an African American slave, was displayed by [[Phineas Taylor Barnum|P.T.

Congolese [[Pygmies|pygmy]] [[Ota Benga]] was displayed in 1906 by [[eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]], head of the [[Bronx Zoo]], as an attempt to illustrate the "missing link" between humans and [[orangutan]]s: thus, racism was tied to [[Darwinism]], creating a [[social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] ideology that tried to ground itself in [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s scientific discoveries. The 1931 Paris [[Colonial Exhibition]] displayed [[Kanaks]] from [[New Caledonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.port.ac.uk/special/france1815to2003/chapter6/interviews/filetodownload,18533,en.pdf The Colonial Exhibition of May 1931]|96.6&amp;nbsp;KB}} by Michael G.

==Evolutionary theories about the origins of racism==
{{see also|Ethnocentrism}}

Biologists [[John Tooby]] and [[Leda Cosmides]] were puzzled by the fact that race is one of the three characteristics most often used in brief descriptions of individuals (the others are age and sex). They reasoned that [[natural selection]] would not have favoured the evolution of an instinct for using race as a classification, because for most of human history, humans almost never encountered members of other races. Tooby and Cosmides hypothesized that modern people use race as a proxy (rough-and-ready indicator) for coalition membership, since a better-than-random guess about "which side" another person is on will be helpful if one does not actually know in advance.

Their colleague [[Robert Kurzban]] designed an experiment whose results appeared to support this hypothesis. Using the [[Memory confusion protocol]], they presented subjects with pictures of individuals and sentences, allegedly spoken by these individuals, which presented two sides of a debate. The errors that the subjects made in recalling who said what indicated that they sometimes misattributed a statement to a speaker of the same race as the "correct" speaker, although they also sometimes misattributed a statement to a speaker "on the same side" as the "correct" speaker. In a second run of the experiment, the team also distinguished the "sides" in the debate by clothing of similar colors; and in this case the effect of racial similarity in causing mistakes almost vanished, being replaced by the color of their clothing. In other words, the first group of subjects, with no clues from clothing, used race as a visual guide to guessing who was on which side of the debate; the second group of subjects used the clothing color as their main visual clue, and the effect of race became very small.

Some research suggests that ethnocentric thinking may have actually contributed to the development of cooperation.  Political scientists Ross Hammond and Robert Axelrod created a computer simulation wherein virtual individuals were randomly assigned one of a variety of skin colors, and then one of a variety of trading strategies: be color-blind, favor those of your own color, or favor those of other colors.  They found that the ethnocentric individuals clustered together, then grew until all the non-ethnocentric individuals were wiped out.&lt;ref&gt;New Scientist. Issue 2595, 17 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] writes that "Blood-feuds and inter-clan warfare are easily interpretable in terms of [[W. D. Hamilton|Hamilton]]'s [[kin selection|genetic theory]]."  Dawkins writes that racial prejudice, while not evolutionarily adaptive, "could be interpreted as an irrational generalization of a kin-selected tendency to identify with individuals physically resembling oneself, and to be nasty to individuals different in appearance".&lt;ref name="Dawkins2006"&gt;{{cite book| author = Richard Dawkins| title = The selfish gene| url = http://books.google.com/?id=EJeHTt8hW7UC&amp;pg=PA99| year = 2006| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-929115-1| page = 99 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simulation-based experiments in [[evolutionary game theory]] have attempted to provide an explanation for the selection of ethnocentric-strategy phenotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1177/0022002706293470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[State racism]]—that is, institutions and practices of a nation-state that are grounded in racist ideology—has played a major role in all instances of [[settler colonialism]], from the United States to Australia to Israel. It also played a prominent role in the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] regime and [[Fascism|fascist]] regimes in Europe, and in the first part of Japan’s [[Shōwa period]]. These governments advocated and implemented policies that were racist, xenophobic and, in case of [[Nazism]], genocidal.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Russel of Liverpool, ''The Knights of Bushido'', 2002, p.238, [[Herbert Bix]], ''[[Hirohito and the making of modern Japan]]'', 2001, p.313, 314, 326, 359, 360, Karel Wolferen, ''The Enigma of Japanese power'', 1989, p.263-272&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Haitianism, Historical Memory, and the Potential for Genocidal Violence in the Dominican Republic University of Toronto Press ISSN 1911-0359 (Print) 1911-9933 (Online) Issue Volume 1, Number 3 / December 2006 DOI 10.3138/7864-3362-3R24-6231&lt;/ref&gt; The politics of Zimbabwe promote discrimination against whites, in an effort to ethnically cleanse the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/africa/03/30/zimbabwe.farmers/index.html |title=Tale of two farms in Zimbabwe – March 30, 2005 |publisher=CNN |date=2005-03-30 |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislative state racism is known to have been enforced by the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] of [[South Africa]] during their [[Apartheid]] regime between 1948 and 1994. Here a series of [[Apartheid legislation in South Africa]] was passed through the legal systems to make it legal for white South Africans to have rights which were superior to those of non-white South Africans. Non-white South Africans were not allowed involvement in any governing matters, including voting; access to quality healthcare; the provision of basic services, including clean water; electricity; as well as access to adequate schooling. Non-white South Africans were also prevented from accessing certain public areas, using certain public transportation and were required to live only in certain designated areas. Non-white South Africans were taxed differently from white South Africans and were required to carry on them at all times additional documentation, which later became known as “dom passes”, to certify their non-white South African citizenship. All of these legislative racial laws were abolished through a series of equal human rights laws passed at the end of [[Apartheid]] in the early 1990s.

State racism contributed as well to the formation of the [[Dominican Republic]]'s identity &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.primicias.com.do/articulo,5408,html  |title=Taína Mirabal, una anti duartiana radical que afirma la historia ha sido distorsionada |author= Miguel Cruz Tejada|date= March 26, 2008|publisher= Primacias|accessdate=2010-10-01 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080327000254/http://www.primicias.com.do/articulo,5408,html |archivedate = 2008-03-27}}(Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; and violent actions encouraged by Dominican governmental [[xenophobia]] against [[Haiti]]ans and "Haitian looking" people. Currently the [[Dominican Republic]] employs a [[de facto]] system of [[separatism]] for children and grandchildren of Haitians and black Dominicans, denying them [[birth certificate]]s, education and access to [[health care]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?lang=e&amp;id=ENGUSA20070321002 |title=Dominican Republic: Haitian Workers Face Deportations, Rights Violations in Dominican Republic, Amnesty International Investigation Finds |publisher=Amnestyusa.org |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In history==

===In Antiquity===
Edith Sanders in 1969 cited the [[Babylonian Talmud]], which divides mankind between the three [[sons of Noah]], stating that "the [[Hamitic|descendants of Ham]] are cursed by being black, and [it] depicts [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] as a sinful man and his progeny as degenerates."&lt;ref name = "edith"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Hamitic Hypothesis: Its Origin and Functions in Time Perspective|first=Edith|last=Sanders|journal= Journal African History|volume=10|issue=4|year=1969|pages=521–532|doi=10.1017/S0021853700009683}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[curse of Ham]] has been used as an explanation for the origin of dark skinned people since the 3rd century A.D., David M. Goldenberg (2005) writes that this was based on a theory that different climates and sun exposure effect semen composition and through this the physical composition of descendants (which is rather unlike modern hereditary understandings of race). Furthermore the earliest appearance of dark skin as a punishment for the descendants of Ham directly related to "Black Africans" does not appear until the 9th or 10th century (in the ''Pirqei de-Rabbenu ha-Qadosh''). Earlier sources assign the punishment of blackness to Ham himself and make no mention of the people of Kush or their skin being a curse. As well, Goldenberg goes on to explain that the earlier (3rd century) sources understood "dark skin" to include not only sub-Saharan black Africa but also: &lt;blockquote&gt;...the Copts, Fezzan, Zaghawa, ''Brbr'', Indians, Arabs, the people of Marw, the inhabitants of the islands in the Indian Ocean, even the Chinese, as well as the Ethiopians (Habash), Zanj, Buja, and Nubians. In other words, "the coloured people of the world."&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1MS9AiZ74MoC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=curse+of+ham+dark+or+brown&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=V18jWULdm6&amp;sig=H1Cicsc_pY60cPOPpeRm9TSgUvo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CqBiUIGAKqf8iwLrj4CwCA&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=curse%20of%20ham%20dark%20or%20brown&amp;f=false |title=The Curse of Ham: Race and Slavery in Early Judaism, Christianity, and Islam - David M.

[[Bernard Lewis]] has cited the [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] who, in his discussion of slavery, stated that while [[Greeks]] are free by nature, '[[barbarian]]s' (non-Greeks) are slaves by nature, in that it is in their nature to be more willing to submit to [[Despotism|despotic]] government.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt; Though Aristotle does not specify any particular races, he argues that people from outside Greece are more prone to the burden of slavery than those from [[Ancient Greece|Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Bernard Lewis| authorlink = Bernard Lewis| title = Race and slavery in the Middle East: an historical enquiry| year = 1992| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-505326-5| pages = 54–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such proto-racism and ethnocentrism must be looked at within context, as a modern understanding of racism based on hereditary inferiority (modern racism based in: [[eugenics]] and [[scientific racism]]) was not yet developed and it is unclear whether Aristotle believed the natural inferiority of Barbarians was caused by environment and climate (like many of his contemporaries) or by birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jfylyRawl8EC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;dq=aristotle+racism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZpgwywIs_L&amp;sig=TsyiS3e2w8zqjJXRb2eyjUJzQhE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l7ZiUO-NJYbqiwKsioHIBw&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=aristotle%20racism&amp;f=false |title=The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity - Benjamin H.

Historian Dante A. Puzzo, in his discussion of Aristotle, racism, and the ancient world writes that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Racism rests on two basic assumptions: that a correlation exists between physical characteristics and moral qualities; that mankind is divisible into superior and inferior stocks. Racism, thus defined, is a modern conception, for prior to the XVIth century there was virtually nothing in the life and thought of the West that can be described as racist. To prevent misunderstanding a clear distinction must be made between racism and ethnocentrism [...] The Ancient Hebrews, in referring to all who were not Hebrews as Gentiles, were indulging in ethnocentrism, not in racism. [...] So it was with the Hellenes who denominated all non-Hellenes——whether the wild Scythians or the Egyptians whom they acknowledged as their mentors in the arts if civilization——Barbarians, the term denoting that which was strange or foreign.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jstor.org.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/stable/2708188?seq=1&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that ethnic prejudice among some elite Arabs was not limited to darker-skinned black people, but was also directed towards fairer-skinned "ruddy people" (including [[Persian people|Persians]], Turks, Caucasians and Europeans), while Arabs referred to themselves as "swarthy people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Bernard Lewis| authorlink = Bernard Lewis| title = Race and slavery in the Middle East: an historical enquiry| year = 1992| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-505326-5| pages = 18–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Umayyad Caliphate invaded Hispania]] and founded the advanced civilization of [[Al-Andalus]], where an era of [[La Convivencia|religious tolerance]] and a [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|Golden age of Jewish culture]] lasted for six centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Sephardim.html Sephardim]. [[Jewish Virtual Library]]. Last accessed 27 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by a violent ''[[Reconquista]]'' under the [[Reyes Catolicos|Catholic monarchs]] [[Ferdinand V of Spain|Ferdinand V]] and [[Isabella I of Spain|Isabella I]]. The Catholic [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] then formulated the ''[[Cleanliness of blood]]'' doctrine. It was during this time in history that the Western concept of aristocratic "[[Nobility#"Blue" blood|blue blood]]" emerged in a highly racialized and implicitly [[white supremacist]] context, as author Robert Lacey explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was the Spaniards who gave the world the notion that an aristocrat's blood is not red but blue. The Spanish nobility started taking shape around the ninth century in classic military fashion, occupying land as warriors on horseback. They were to continue the process for more than five hundred years, clawing back sections of the peninsula from its Moorish occupiers, and a nobleman demonstrated his pedigree by holding up his sword arm to display the filigree of blue-blooded veins beneath his pale skin—proof that his birth had not been contaminated by the dark-skinned enemy. Sangre azul, blue blood, was thus a euphemism for being a [[white people|white]] man—Spain's own particular reminder that the refined footsteps of the aristocracy through history carry the rather less refined spoor of racism.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lacey, ''Aristocrats''. Little, Brown and Company, 1983, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the expulsion of most [[Sephardic Jews]] from the Iberian peninsula, the remaining [[Jew]]s and [[Muslim]]s were forced to [[Converso|convert]] to Roman Catholicism, becoming "[[New Christian]]s" which were despised and discriminated by the "[[Old Christian]]s". An [[Inquisition]] was carried out by members of the [[Dominican Order]] in order to weed out converts that still practiced [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]] in secret. The system and ideology of the ''limpieza de sangre'' ostracized Christian converts from society, regardless of their actual degree of sincerity in their faith.

In [[Portugal]], the legal distinction between New and Old Christian was only ended through a legal decree issued by the [[Marquis of Pombal]] in 1772, almost three centuries after the implementation of the racist discrimination. The ''limpieza de sangre'' doctrine was also very common in the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonization of the Americas]], where it led to the racial separation of the various peoples in the colonies and created a very intricate list of nomenclature to describe one's precise race and, by consequence, one's place in society. This precise classification was described by [[Eduardo Galeano]] in the ''Open Veins of Latin America'' (1971). It included, among others terms, ''[[mestizo]]'' (50% Spaniard and 50% Native American), ''[[castizo]]'' (75% European and 25% Native American), ''Spaniard'' (87.5% European and 12.5% Native American), ''[[Mulatto]]'' (50% European and 50% African), ''Albarazado'' (43.75% Native American, 29.6875% European, and 26.5625% African), etc.

At the end of the [[Spanish Renaissance|Renaissance]], the [[Valladolid debate]] (1550–1551) concerning the treatment of [[Indigenous people of the Americas|natives]] of the "[[New World]]" opposed the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar and Bishop of Chiapas [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]] to another Dominican [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda]]. The latter argued that "Indians" were natural slaves because they had no souls, and were therefore beneath humanity. Thus, reducing them to slavery or serfdom was in accordance with Catholic theology and [[natural law]]. To the contrary, Bartolomé de Las Casas argued that the Amerindians were free men in the natural order and deserved the same treatment as others, according to [[Catholic theology]]. It was one of the many controversies concerning racism, slavery and [[Eurocentrism]] that would arise in the following centuries.

Although [[Christian antisemitism|antisemitism]] has a long European history, related to Christianism ([[anti-Judaism]]), racism itself is frequently described as a ''modern'' phenomenon. In the view of the French philosopher and historian [[Michel Foucault]], the first formulation of racism emerged in the [[Early modern Europe|Early Modern period]] as the "[[discourse]] of race struggle", a historical and political discourse, which Foucault opposed to the philosophical and juridical discourse of [[sovereignty]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, ''Society Must Be Defended'' (1976–77)&lt;/ref&gt;  Foucault thus argued that the first appearance of racism as a social [[discourse]] (as opposed to simple [[xenophobia]], which some might argue has existed in all places and times) may be found during the 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]] in Great Britain, in [[Edward Coke]] or [[John Lilburne]]'s work.

However, this "discourse of race struggle", as interpreted by Foucault, must be distinguished from the 19th century biological racism, also known as "race science" or "[[scientific racism]]". Indeed, this early modern discourse has many points of difference with modern racism. First of all, in this "discourse of race struggle", "race" is not considered a biological notion — which would divide humanity into distinct biological groups — but as a ''historical notion''. Moreover, this discourse is opposed to the sovereign's discourse: it is used by the [[bourgeoisie]], the people and the aristocracy as a mean of struggle against the monarchy. This discourse, which first appeared in Great Britain, was then carried on in France by people such as [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]], [[Nicolas Fréret]], and then, during the 1789 [[French Revolution]], [[Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès|Sieyès]], and afterward [[Augustin Thierry]] and [[Antoine Augustin Cournot|Cournot]]. Boulainvilliers, which created the matrix of such racist discourse in medieval France, conceived the "race" as something closer to the sense of "nation", that is, in his times, the "people".

He conceived France as divided between various nations — the unified [[nation-state]] is, of course, here an [[anachronism]] — which themselves formed different "races". Boulainvilliers opposed the [[absolute monarchy]], who tried to bypass the [[aristocracy]] by establishing a direct relationship to the [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]]. Thus, he created this theory of the French aristocrats as being the descendants of foreign invaders, whom he called the "[[Franks]]", while the Third Estate constituted according to him the autochthonous, vanquished [[Gallo-Romans]], who were dominated by the Frankish aristocracy as a consequence of the [[right of conquest]]. Early modern racism was opposed to [[nationalism]] and the nation-state: the [[François Dominique de Reynaud de Montlosier|Comte de Montlosier]], in exile during the French Revolution, who borrowed Boulainvilliers' discourse on the "Nordic race" as being the French aristocracy that invaded the plebeian "Gauls", thus showed his despise for the Third Estate calling it "this new people born of slaves... [[miscegenation|mixture of all races and of all times]]".

While 19th century racism became closely intertwined with nationalism, leading to the [[ethnic nationalist]] discourse that identified the "race" to the "[[folk]]", leading to such movements as [[pan-Germanism]], [[Zionism]], [[pan-Turkism]], [[pan-Arabism]], and [[pan-Slavism]], medieval racism precisely divided the nation into various non-biological "races", which were thought as the consequences of historical conquests and [[social conflict]]s. Michel Foucault traced the genealogy of modern racism to this medieval "historical and political discourse of race struggle". According to him, it divided itself in the 19th century according to two rival lines: on one hand, it was incorporated by racists, biologists and [[eugenicists]], who gave it the modern sense of "race" and, even more, transformed this popular discourse into a "[[state racism]]" (e.g. Nazism). On the other hand, [[Marxism|Marxists]] also seized this discourse founded on the assumption of a political struggle that provided the real [[philosophy of history|engine of history]] and continued to act underneath the apparent peace. Thus, Marxists transformed the [[essentialist]] notion of "race" into the historical notion of "[[class struggle]]", defined by socially structured position: capitalist or proletarian. In ''[[The Will to Knowledge]]'' (1976), Foucault analyzed another opponent of the "race struggle" discourse: [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]], which opposed the concepts of "blood [[heredity]]", prevalent in the 19th century racist discourse.

===19th century===
Authors such as [[Hannah Arendt]], in her 1951 book ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', have said that the racist ideology (''popular racism'') that developed at the end of the 19th century helped legitimize the [[New Imperialism|imperialist conquests]] of foreign territories and the acts that accompanied them (such as the [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide]] of 1904–1907 or the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915–1917). [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem ''[[The White Man's Burden]]'' (1899) is one of the more famous illustrations of the belief in the inherent superiority of the [[Western culture|European culture]] over the rest of the world, though also it is also thought to be a satirical appraisal of such imperialism. Racist ideology thus helped legitimize subjugation and the dismantling of the traditional societies of indigenous peoples, which were regarded as humanitarian obligations as a result of these racist beliefs.
[[File:Scientific racism irish.jpg|thumb|An illustration from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' shows an alleged similarity between "Irish Iberian" and "Negro" features in contrast to the higher "Anglo-Teutonic."]]
However, during the 19th century, West European colonial powers were involved in the suppression of the [[Arab slave trade]] in Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server?show=nav.5938&amp;outputFormat=print |title=Royal Navy and the Slave Trade : Battles : History |publisher=Royal-navy.mod.uk |accessdate=2010-05-23|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110510210721/http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server?show=nav.5938&amp;outputFormat=print |archivedate = May 10, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in suppression of the [[slave trade]] in [[West Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/visit_see_victory_cfexhibition_infosheet.htm |title=Chasing Freedom Exhibition: the Royal Navy and the Suppression of the Transatlantic Slave Trade |publisher=Royalnavalmuseum.org |date=2006-11-21 |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other colonialists recognized the depravity of their actions but persisted for personal gain; some Europeans during the time period objected to the injustices caused by [[colonialism]] and lobbied on behalf of [[aboriginal peoples]]. Thus, when the [[Hottentot Venus]] was displayed in England in the beginning of the 19th century, the African Association publicly opposed itself to the exhibition. The same year that Kipling published his poem, [[Joseph Conrad]] published ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899), a clear criticism of the [[Congo Free State]] owned by [[Leopold II of Belgium]].

Examples of racial theories used include the creation of the [[Hamitic]] [[ethno-linguistic]] group during the [[European exploration of Africa]]. It was then restricted by [[Karl Friedrich Lepsius]] (1810–1877) to non-[[Semitic]] [[Afro-Asiatic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Merriam Webster (editor), ''Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'', 10 Rev Ed edition, (Merriam-Webster: 1998), p.563&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Hamite'' was applied to different populations within Africa, mainly comprising [[Ethiopia]]ns, [[Demographics of Eritrea|Eritreans]], [[Somali people|Somalis]], [[Berber people|Berbers]], and [[Nubian people|Nubians]]. Hamites were regarded as Caucasoid peoples who probably originated in either [[Arabia]] or [[Middle East|Asia]] on the basis of their cultural, physical and linguistic similarities with the peoples of those areas.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald James Harrison, ''Africa and the Islands'', (Wiley: 1965), p.58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Dodge, ''African Politics in Perspective'', (Van Nostrand: 1966), p.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Senior, ''Tropical Lands: a human geography'', (Longman: 1979), p.59&lt;/ref&gt; Europeans considered Hamites to be more civilized than [[Black people|Black Africans]], and more akin to themselves and [[Semitic]] peoples.&lt;ref&gt;A. H. M. Jones, Elizabeth Monroe, ''History of Abyssinia'', (Kessinger Publishing: 2003), p.25&lt;/ref&gt; In the first two-thirds of the 20th century, the Hamitic race was, in fact, considered one of the branches of the [[Caucasian race]], along with the [[Aryan race|Indo-Europeans]], [[Semites]], and the [[Mediterranean race]].

However, the Hamitic peoples themselves were often deemed to have failed as rulers, which was usually ascribed to [[miscegenation|interbreeding]] with Negroes. In the mid-20th century, the German scholar [[Carl Meinhof]] (1857–1944) claimed that the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] race was formed by a merger of [[Hamitic]] and [[Negroid|Negro]] races. The Hottentots ([[Nama people|Nama]] or [[Khoi]]) were formed by the merger of Hamitic and [[Bushmen]] (San) races — both being termed nowadays as [[Khoisan]] peoples).

In the United States in the early 19th century, the [[American Colonization Society]] was established as the primary vehicle for proposals to return black Americans to greater freedom and equality in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcnl.org/issues/item.php?item_id=731&amp;issue_id=75 |title=Background on conflict in Liberia |publisher=Fcnl.org |date=2003-07-30 |accessdate=2011-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colonization effort resulted from a mixture of motives with its founder [[Henry Clay]] stating; "unconquerable prejudice resulting from their color, they never could amalgamate with the free whites of this country. It was desirable, therefore, as it respected them, and the residue of the population of the country, to drain them off".&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Montesinos Sale (1997). The slumbering volcano: American slave ship revolts and the production of rebellious masculinity. p.264. Duke University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Racism spread throughout the New World in the late 19th century and early 20th century. [[Whitecapping]], which started in Indiana in the late 19th century, soon spread throughout all of North America, causing many African laborers to flee from the land they worked on. In the US during the 1860s, racist posters were used during election campaigns. In one of these racist posters (see above), a black man is depicted lounging idly in the foreground as one white man ploughs his field and another chops wood. Accompanying labels are: "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread," and "The white man must work to keep his children and pay his taxes." The black man wonders, "Whar is de use for me to work as long as dey make dese appropriations." Above in a cloud is an image of the "Freedman's Bureau! Negro Estimate of Freedom!" The bureau is pictured as a large domed building resembling the U.S. Capitol and is inscribed "Freedom and No Work." Its columns and walls are labeled, "Candy," "Rum, Gin, Whiskey," "Sugar Plums," "Indolence," "White Women," "Apathy," "White Sugar," "Idleness," and so on.

On June 5, 1873, Sir [[Francis Galton]], distinguished English explorer and cousin of Charles Darwin, wrote in a letter to [[The Times]]:

:''"My proposal is to make the encouragement of [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] settlements of [[Africa]] a part of our national policy, in the belief that the Chinese immigrants would not only maintain their position, but that they would multiply and their descendants supplant the inferior Negro race" "I should expect that the African seaboard, now sparsely occupied by lazy, palavering savages, might in a few years be tenanted by industrious, order-loving Chinese, living either as a semidetached dependency of China, or else in perfect freedom under their own law."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrew Malone |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1036105/How-Chinas-taking-Africa-West-VERY-worried.html |title=How China's taking over Africa, and why the West should be VERY worried |work=Daily Mail |date=2008-07-18 |accessdate=2010-05-23 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research on influencing factors ==
Research has examined factors influencing tolerance, in particular ethnic tolerance, prejudice, and trust. [[Authoritarian personality]] has been associated with prejudice and intolerance. [[Education]] has an inverse association which is stronger in established democracies than in emerging. Different groups are viewed differently and including illegal groups in tolerance surveys may reduce tolerance levels in all countries except the United States. Increased contact with other groups increase tolerance. Increased perception of threat, including from the home land of an ethnic minority, reduces tolerance. Competition over jobs reduces tolerance and occupational [[Racial segregation|segregation]] reduced ethnic conflicts and ethnic prejudice in studies in the United States and [[Yugoslavia]]. Tolerance is increased by democratic stability and a federal system. Increased ethnic heterogeneity increases tolerance up to a point but beyond this tolerance decreases. The negative effect of increased ethnic heterogeneity is stronger when looking at larger areas such as nations compared to smaller areas such as neighborhoods. This may be due to the contact effect being relatively more important at local levels while the threat effect becomes more important in larger areas.&lt;ref&gt;Yasushi Hazama, Determinants of political tolerance : a literature review, IDE Discussion Paper. No. 288. 2011. http://ideas.repec.org/p/jet/dpaper/dpaper288.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-Racism==
{{Main|Anti-racism}}
[[Image:Anti-racist-rally-Sydney-2005-Dec-18-small.jpeg|thumb|right|A peaceful anti-racism rally held outside Sydney Town Hall, December 2005.]]
Anti-racism includes beliefs, actions, movements, and policies adopted or developed to oppose racism. In general, it promotes an egalitarian society in which people are not discriminated against in race. Movements such as the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement]] and the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] were examples of anti-racist movements. [[Nonviolent resistance]] is sometimes an element of anti-racial movements, although this was not always the case. [[Hate crime]] laws, [[affirmative action]], and bans on racist speech are also examples of government policy designed to suppress racism.

===International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination===
UNESCO marks March 21 as the yearly [[International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]], in memory of the events that occurred on March 21, 1960 in [[Sharpeville massacre|Sharpeville]], [[South Africa]], where police killed student demonstrators peacefully protesting against the [[apartheid]] regime.
