'''Eliminationism''' is the belief that one's political opponents are "a [[cancer]] on the body politic that must be excised—either by separation from the public at large, through [[censorship]] or by outright [[mass murder|extermination]]—in order to protect the purity of the nation".&lt;ref name="Bernard 2009"&gt;{{cite paper| last = Bernard | first = Phyllis E. | title = Eliminationist Discourse In A Conflicted Society: Lessons For America From Africa? | date = June 12, 2009 | url = http://epublications.marquette.edu/mulr/vol93/iss1/12/ |accessdate = 2009-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''eliminationism'' was coined by American political scientist [[Daniel Goldhagen]] in his 1996 book ''[[Hitler's Willing Executioners]]'' in which he posits that ordinary [[Germans]] not only knew about, but also supported, the [[Holocaust]] because of a unique and virulent "eliminationist antisemitism" in the German identity, which had developed in the preceding centuries.&lt;ref name="Bernard 2009"/&gt;

==Effects==
In his 2009 book ''Worse Than War: Genocide, Eliminationism, and the Ongoing Assault on Humanity'', Goldhagen argues that eliminationism is the root cause of every [[mass murder]] perpetrated in the 20th and 21st centuries, including:&lt;ref name="Gray 2009"&gt;{{cite paper| author = Gray, John | title = Worse Than War: Genocide, Eliminationism and the Ongoing Assault on Humanity By Daniel Jonah Goldhagen | date = 4 February 2010 | url = http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2010/02/genocide-goldhagen-mass | accessdate = 2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American journalist [[David Neiwert]] argues that eliminationist rhetoric is becoming increasingly mainstream within the [[Conservatism in the United States|American right wing]], fueled in large part by the extremist discourse found on conservative [[blog]]s and [[talk radio]], which may provoke a resurgence of [[lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolf terrorism]].&lt;ref name="Holland 2009"&gt;{{cite paper| author = Holland, Joshua | title = The Terrorist Threat: Right-Wing Radicals and the Eliminationist Mindset | date = 12 June 2009 | url = http://www.alternet.org/module/printversion/140578 | accessdate = 2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American professor of law Phyllis E. Bernard argues that interventions in [[Rwanda]] and [[Nigeria]], which adapted American dispute prevention and [[dispute resolution|resolution]] methods to African media and dispute resolution traditions, may provide a better fit and forum for the U.S. to address eliminationist media messages and their impact on society.&lt;ref name="Bernard 2009"/&gt;

==Eliminationism elsewhere==
{{See|Theodore N. Kaufman|Germany Must Perish!}}
An infamous eliminationist, [[Theodore N. Kaufman]], self-published [[Germany Must Perish!]] in the United States in 1941. In the 104-page book, Kaufman advocated genocide through [[forced sterilization]] of all [[Germans]] and the territorial disassociation of [[Germany]]. The obscure book received very little attention in the US, but was eventually cited by the [[Nazi]] regime as proof of a vast [[Jew]]ish [[List_of_conspiracy_theories#Antisemitic_conspiracy_theories|conspiracy]] to annihilate Germany and Germans (Kaufman was a Jew). The Nazis published quotes from the book in wartime [[propaganda]], pretending that the book was indicative of the views of the [[Allied Powers]], which in turn was added justification for Nazi Germany's continued persecution of the Jews as part of the [[Holocaust]].

During the 1991-2002 [[Algerian Civil War]] the predominant faction of the conflict's first phase was known as [[les éradicateurs]] for their ideology and for their rural and urban tactics. These hardliners were opposed in the [[People's_National_Army_(Algeria)|Army]] and the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] by [[les dialoguistes]].
