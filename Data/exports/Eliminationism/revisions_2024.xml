{{Short description|Political ideology}}

'''Eliminationism''' is the belief that a social group is, in the words of [[Oklahoma City University School of Law]] professor Phyllis E. Bernard, "a [[cancer]] on the body politic that must be excised—either by separation from the public at large, through [[censorship]] or by outright [[mass murder|extermination]]—in order to protect the purity of the nation."&lt;ref name="Bernard 2009"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bernard|first=Phyllis E.|title=Eliminationist Discourse In A Conflicted Society: Lessons For America From Africa?|date=June 12, 2009|url=http://epublications.marquette.edu/mulr/vol93/iss1/12/|access-date=2009-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''eliminationism'' was coined by American political scientist [[Daniel Goldhagen]] in his 1996 book ''[[Hitler's Willing Executioners|Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust]]'', in which he posits that the [[German people|German public]] not only knew about, but supported, [[the Holocaust]] because of a unique and virulent "eliminationist [[antisemitism]]" within the German national identity, which had developed in the preceding centuries.&lt;ref name="Bernard 2009"/&gt; 

==Types==
The purpose of defining eliminationism is the inherent weakness of the term "[[genocide]]", which only allows for action where mass slaughter has already occurred. However, according to Goldhagen, extermination is usually seen as one (and the most extreme) option of getting rid of an unwanted people group seen as a threat, and in any case of extermination many of the other methods of eliminationism will also be present and probably used first.

There are five forms of eliminationism:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/worse-than-war/featured/understanding-genocide-eliminationism/26/|title=Understanding Genocide ~ Eliminationism &amp;#124; Worse Than War &amp;#124; PBS|website=[[PBS]]|date=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Transformation: deleting/changing the cultural identities of people (examples include [[American Indian boarding schools]]).
# Repression: systematically limiting the power of the target group through political [[disenfranchisement]], ghettos, [[Slavery|enslavement]], [[Racial segregation|segregation]], or other legal means (examples include [[anti-Jewish legislation in pre-war Nazi Germany]], [[Jim Crow laws]], [[voter suppression]] and [[Apartheid]]).
# Expulsion: removing the undesired group through [[deportation]], [[Population transfer|forced removal]], [[Death march|forced marches]], [[Internment|concentration camps]] (examples include the [[Armenian genocide]] and the [[internment of Japanese Americans]]).
# Contraception: [[forced sterilization]], [[anti-miscegenation laws]], or [[Genocidal rape|systematic rape]] so that there will be no future for the group.
# Extermination: mass murder or [[genocide]].

==Effects==
In his 2009 book ''Worse Than War: Genocide, Eliminationism, and the Ongoing Assault on Humanity'', Goldhagen argued that eliminationism is integral to politics due to mass murder being "a political act", writing that "mass elimination is ''always'' preventable and ''always'' results from conscious political choice." Goldhagen describes various 20th-century atrocities, such as the [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66]] and genocides in [[Darfur genocide|Darfur]], [[Bosnian genocide|Yugoslavia]], [[Rwandan genocide|Rwanda]] and [[Guatemalan genocide|Guatemala]], arguing that each of these events were products of eliminationism, being perpetrated by "the decisions of a handful of powerful people" in contrast to popular perceptions of such events being carried out "in a frenzy of bloodlust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pindar|first1=Ian|title=Worse Than War: Genocide, Eliminationism and the Ongoing Assault on Humanity by Daniel Jonah Goldhagen|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/06/worse-than-war-daniel-goldhagen|access-date=28 December 2021|work=The Guardian|date=6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Romaniuk, Scott Nicholas (2011) "Book Review: Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, Worse than War: Genocide,

Businessman [[Theodore N. Kaufman]] self-published ''[[Germany Must Perish!]]'' in the United States in 1941. In the 104-page book, Kaufman advocated genocide through [[forced sterilization]] of all Germans and the territorial disassociation of [[Germany]]. The obscure book received very little attention in the U.S., but was eventually cited by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] as proof of a vast [[List of conspiracy theories#Antisemitic conspiracy theories|Jewish conspiracy]] to annihilate Germany and Germans (Kaufman was a Jew). The Nazis published quotes from the book in wartime [[propaganda]], pretending that the book was indicative of the views of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]], which in turn was added justification for Nazi Germany's continued persecution of the Jews as part of the Holocaust.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

During the 1991–2002 [[Algerian Civil War]], the predominant faction of the conflict's first phase was known as ''[[les éradicateurs]]'' for their ideology and for their rural and urban tactics. These hardliners were opposed in the [[People's National Army (Algeria)|Army]] and the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] by ''[[les dialoguistes]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

Journalist [[David Neiwert]] argued in 2009 that eliminationist rhetoric is becoming increasingly mainstream within the [[Conservatism in the United States|American right-wing]], fuelled in large part by the extremist discourse found on conservative [[blog]]s and [[talk radio]] shows, which may provoke a resurgence of [[Lone wolf attack|lone wolf terrorism]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="Holland 2009"&gt;{{cite web|last=Holland |first=oshua |title=The Terrorist Threat: Right-Wing Radicals and the Eliminationist Mindset |date=12 June 2009 |url=http://www.alternet.org/module/printversion/140578 |access-date=2009-07-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723075225/http://www.alternet.org/module/printversion/140578 |archive-date=2009-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Legal education|Professor of law]] Phyllis E. Bernard argues that interventions in [[Rwanda]] and [[Nigeria]], which adapted American dispute prevention and [[Dispute resolution|resolution]] methods to African media and dispute resolution traditions, may provide a better fit and forum for the U.S. to address eliminationist media messages and their impact on society.&lt;ref name="Bernard 2009"/&gt;
