A '''gender role''' is a set of societal [[norm (social)|norms]] dictating the types of behaviors which are generally considered acceptable, appropriate, or desirable for people based on their actual or perceived [[Sex assignment|sex]] or [[sexuality]]. Gender roles are usually centered on conceptions of [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]], although there are [[Third gender|exceptions]] and [[genderqueer|variations]]. The specifics regarding these gendered expectations may vary substantially among cultures, while other characteristics may be common throughout a range of cultures. There is ongoing debate as to what extent gender roles and their variations are [[Sex differences in humans|biologically determined]], and to what extent they are [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]].

Various groups, most notably the [[feminism|feminist movement]], have led efforts to change aspects of prevailing gender roles that they believe are oppressive or inaccurate.

The term ''gender role'' was first coined by [[John Money]] in 1955, during the course of his study of [[intersex]] individuals, to describe the manners in which these individuals expressed their status as a [[male]] or [[female]] in a situation where no clear biological assignment existed.

==Background==
{{See also|Gender expression}}
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) defines gender roles as "socially constructed roles, behaviors, activities and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women".&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/gender/whatisgender/en/index.html |title=What do we mean by "sex" and "gender"? |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |website=WHO.int |publisher=World Health Organization |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818074425/http://apps.who.int/gender/whatisgender/en/index.html |archivedate=18 August 2015 |accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debate continues as to what extent gender and gender roles are socially constructed (i.e. non-biologically influenced), and to what extent "socially constructed" may be considered synonymous with "arbitrary" or "malleable".&lt;ref&gt;The social construction of race.

Some systems of classification, unlike WHO's, are non-binary or [[genderqueer]],{{Clarify|reason=Genderqueer is primarily an identity that does not fit the binary; genderqueer people are not always outwardly gender non-conforming.|date=October 2017}} allowing for more than two possible gender classifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federation of Gay Games - Gender in Sport|url=https://gaygames.org/wp/sport/sports-policiesd/gender/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trans-sport"/&gt; Gender roles are culturally specific, and while some cultures distinguish only two ([[Boy]] and [[Girl]] or [[Man]] and [[Woman]]), others recognize more.

Many transgender people reject the idea that they are a separate third gender, and identify simply as men or women.&lt;ref name="vox-trans"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/4/24/8483561/transgender-gender-identity-expression|title=9 questions about gender identity and being transgender you were too embarrassed to ask|website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|last=Lopez|first=German|date=18 April 2016|accessdate=31 July 2016|quote="Transitioning can be made much more difficult by persistent misconceptions, including the myth that transgender people belong to a third gender."}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, biological differences between (some) [[trans women]] and cisgender women have historically been treated as relevant in certain contexts, such as sport.&lt;ref name="trans-sport"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/d8691a6dcaf6f5e469538ddc3fa4a5fb/1?pq-origsite=gscholar|title=Transsexual and Transgender Policies in Sport|last=Sykes|first=Heather|journal=Women in Sport &amp; Physical Activity Journal|volume=15|number=1|year=2006|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender ''role,'' which refers to the cultural expectations as understood by gender classification, is not the same thing as [[gender identity]], which refers to the internal sense of one's own gender, whether or not it aligns with categories offered by societal norms. The point at which these [[Internalization|internalized]] gender identities become [[Externalization|externalized]] into ''a set of expectations'' ''is the genesis of a gender role''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adler | first1 = P. | last2 = Kless | first2 = S. | last3 = Adler | first3 = P | year = 1992 | title = Socialization to gender roles: Popularity among elementary school boys and girls | url = | journal = Sociology of education | volume = 65 | issue = 3| pages = 169–087 | doi=10.2307/2112807| jstor = 2112807 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Acker | first1 = J | year = 1992 | title = From sex roles to gendered institutions | url = | journal = Contemporary Sociology: A Journal of Reviews | volume = 21 | issue = 5| pages = 565–569 | doi=10.2307/2075528| jstor = 2075528 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were not granted [[Women's suffrage|the right to vote]] in many parts of the world until the 19th or 20th centuries{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}, and some women&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/10/in-saudi-arabia-a-quiet-step-forward-for-women/247351/ "In Saudi Arabia, a Quiet Step Forward for Women"]. The Atlantic. Oct 26 2011&lt;/ref&gt; were not granted a vote well into the 21st century. Women throughout the world, in many ways, do not enjoy full freedom and protection under the law (see [[Women's rights]]). Due to the prevailing perception of men as primarily breadwinners, they are seldom afforded the benefit of [[paternity leave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/2853080/fathers-day-gift-paternity-leave-feminism-for-men/|title=it's time for paternity leave for working fathers|author=James Poniewozik|work=TIME.com|accessdate=14 June 2015|date=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for some individuals gender roles may provide a positive effect, and their absence may prove difficult: while gender roles may be used as deleterious gender stereotypes, they can offer a clear avenue to verify and structure socially acceptable behavior. Additionally, fulfilling one's prescribed gender roles has been correlated with increased self-esteem, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Frome, P. &amp; Eccles (1996) Gender roles identity and self-esteem. Poster presented at the biannual meeting of the Society for Research on Adolescence.&lt;/ref&gt; As Kelsey Beckham, who self-identifies as gender neutral, phrased it:

==Theories of gender as a social construct==
{{Main article|Social construction of gender difference}}

Some theories - which are collectively termed ''social construction'' theories - claim that gender behavior is mostly due to social conventions, although opposing theories disagree, such as theories in [[evolutionary psychology]].

Most children learn to categorize themselves by gender by the age of three.&lt;ref name="Pate"&gt;{{cite web |last=Pate |first=J. s.d |title=What everyone should know about gender and sexuality |url=http://jamespatemd.com/Pubs/gendersexuality.htm|website=jamespatemd.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119172004/http://jamespatemd.com/Pubs/gendersexuality.htm |archivedate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From birth, children learn gender stereotypes and roles from their parents and environment. In a traditional view, males learn to manipulate their physical and social environment through physical strength or dexterity, while girls learn to present themselves as objects to be viewed.&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, S. E. (1986) Language practices and self definition: The case of gender identity acquisition. The sociological Quarterly vol. 27, issue 3, pp 295-311&lt;/ref&gt; Social constructionists state, for example, that gender-segregated children's activities create the appearance that gender differences in behavior reflect an essential nature of male and female behavior.&lt;ref name="Fenstermaker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fenstermaker|first=Sarah|title=Doing Gender, Doing Difference: Inequality, Power, and Institutional Change|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-93179-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7vLBpyjCFwsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Doing%20gender%2C%20doing%20difference&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender role theory "treats these differing distributions of women and men into roles as the primary origin of sex-differentiated social behavior, their impact on behavior is mediated by psychological and social processes."&lt;ref&gt;Eagly, A.H. (1997). Sex differences in social behavior: Comparing social role theory and evolutionary psychology. American Psychologist, December, 1380-1383.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gilbert Herdt]], gender roles arose from correspondent inference, meaning that general labour division was extended to gender roles.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Socially constructed gender roles are considered to be hierarchical, and are characterized as a male-advantaged gender hierarchy by social constructionists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = W. | last2 = Eagly | first2 = A.

===Talcott Parsons===
Working in the United States, [[Talcott Parsons]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arte-tv.com Franco-German TV Station ARTE], Karambolage, August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; developed a model of the [[nuclear family]] in 1955, which at that place and time was the prevalent family structure.{{According to whom|date=June 2016}} It compared a strictly traditional view of gender roles (from an industrial-age American perspective) with a more liberal view. The Parsons model was used to contrast and illustrate extreme positions on gender roles.

Model A describes total separation of male and female roles, while Model B describes the complete dissolution of gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;Brockhaus: Enzyklopädie der Psychologie, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; (The examples are based on the context of the culture and [[infrastructure]] of the United States.)

However, these structured positions become less a liberal-individualist society, {{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and the actual behavior of individuals is usually somewhere between these poles. According to the interactionist approach, roles (including gender roles) are not fixed but are constantly negotiated between individuals. In North America and southern South America, this is the most common approach among families whose business is [[agriculture]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Gender roles can influence all kinds of behaviors, such as choice of clothing, choice of work and personal relationships, e.g., parental status (See also [[Sociology of fatherhood]]).{{According to whom|date=June 2016}}

===Geert Hofstede===
[[File:Landsdowne Herakles.jpg|thumb|upright|In Greek mythology, [[Heracles]] is synonymous with [[Apollonian]] masculinity.]]
[[Geert Hofstede]], a Dutch researcher and social psychologist who dedicated himself to the study of culture, sees culture as "broad patterns of thinking, feeling and acting" in a society&lt;ref&gt;Hoststede, Geert. 1998. Masculinity and Femininity: The Taboo Dimension of National Cultures. page 5&lt;/ref&gt; In Hofstede’s view, masculinity and femininity differ in the social roles that are associated with the biological fact of the existence of the two sexes: masculinity and femininity refer to the dominant sex role pattern in the vast majority of both traditional and modern societies, males being more assertive and females more nurturing.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, G. (1980). Culture’s consequences: international differences in work-related values. Beverly Hills, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Femininity creates a society of overlapping gender roles, where "both men and women are supposed to be modest, tender, and concerned with the quality of life."&lt;ref name="Hof 2001"&gt;Hofstede (2001), Culture’s Consequences, 2nd ed. p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

Masculinity creates a society of clearly distinct gender roles, where men should "be assertive, tough, and focused on material success," while women should "be more modest, tender, and concerned with the quality of life."&lt;ref name="Hof 2001" /&gt;

Hofstede's ''Feminine and Masculine Culture Dimensions'' states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Masculine cultures expect men to be assertive, ambitious and competitive, to strive for material success, and to respect whatever is big, strong, and fast. Masculine cultures expect women to serve and care for the non-material quality of life, for children and for the weak. Feminine cultures, on the other hand, deﬁne relatively overlapping social roles for the sexes, in which, in particular, men need not be ambitious or competitive but may go for a different quality of life than material success; men may respect whatever is small, weak, and slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hofstede | first1 = G | year = 1986 | title = Cultural differences in teaching and learning | url = | journal = International Journal of Intercultural Relations | volume = 10 | issue = 3| page = 308}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In feminine cultures, modesty and relationships are important characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hofstede|first=Geert|year=2002|title=Consensus Societies with Their Own Character: National Cultures in Japan and the Netherlands.|url=|journal=Comparative Sociology|volume=1|pages=7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from in masculine cultures, where self-enhancement leads to self-esteem. Masculine cultures are individualistic, and feminine cultures are more collective because of the significance of personal relationships.

'The dominant values in a masculine society are achievement and success; the dominant values in a feminine society are caring for others and quality of life'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hofstede|first1=Geert|last2=de Mooij|first2=Marickc|title=The Hofstede model Applications to global branding and advertising strategy and research|journal=International Journal of Advertising|date=2010|volume=29|issue=1|page=89|doi=10.2501/S026504870920104X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, [[Albert Ellis]] studied eighty-four cases of mixed births and concluded that 'while the power of the human sex drive may possibly be largely dependent on physiological factors... the direction of this drive does not seem to be directly dependent on constitutional element'.&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling, Anne 2000" /&gt; In the development of masculinity, femininity, and inclinations towards homosexuality or heterosexuality, nurture matters a great deal more than nature.&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling, Anne 2000"&gt;Fausto-Sterling, Anne (2000).

===John Money===
"In the 1950s, [[John Money]], along with colleagues took up the study of [[intersex]] individuals, who, Money realized 'would provide invaluable material for the comparative study for bodily form and physiology, rearing, and [[psychosexual]] orientation'."&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling-2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fausto-Sterling |first=Anne |authorlink=Anne Fausto-Sterling |title=Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-976qhsz7A4C&amp;pg=PA46 |date=4 August 2008 |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7867-2433-8 |page=46 |oclc=818855499 |orig-year=1st pub. 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Money and his colleagues used their own studies to state in the extreme what these days seems extraordinary for its complete denial of the notion of natural inclination."&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling-2008" /&gt;

They concluded that [[gonads]], [[hormones]], and [[chromosomes]] did not automatically determine a child's gender role.&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling, Anne 2000" /&gt; Among the many terms he coined was ''gender role'' which he defined in a seminal 1955 paper as "all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman."&lt;ref name="Basic-Concepts"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Money |first=John |authorlink1=John Money |last2=Hampson |first2=Joan G |last3=Hampson |first3=John |date=October 1955 |title=An Examination of Some Basic Sexual Concepts: The Evidence of Human Hermaphroditism |journal=Bull.

In recent years, the majority of Money's theories regarding the importance of socialization in the determination of gender have come under intense criticism, especially in connection with the false reporting of success in the "John/Joan" case, later revealed to be [[David Reimer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Colapinto|first=J.|title=The True Story of John/Joan|work=The Rolling Stone|date=11 December 1997|pages=54–97|url=http://www.healthyplace.com/gender/inside-intersexuality/the-true-story-of-john-joan/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colapinto, J.

=== Candace West and Don H. Zimmerman ===
West and Zimmerman developed an interactionist perspective on gender beyond its construction as "roles." For them, gender is "the product of social doings of some sort...undertaken by men and women whose competence as members of society is hostage to its production".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=West|first=Candace|last2=Zimmerman|first2=Don H.|date=June 1987|title=Doing Gender|journal=Gender and Society|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc|volume=1|issue=2|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the use of "role" to describe gender expectations conceals the production of gender through everyday activities. Furthermore, roles are situated identities, such as "nurse" and "student," developed as the situation demands while gender is a master identity with no specific site or organizational context. For them, "conceptualizing gender as a role makes it difficult to assess its influence on other roles and reduces its explanatory usefulness in discussions of power and inequality".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; West and Zimmerman consider gender an individual production that reflects and constructs interactional and institutional gender expectations.

Because of the influence of [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s feminist works and [[Michel Foucault]]'s reflections on sexuality (among others), the idea that [[gender]] was unrelated to sex gained ground during the 1980s, especially in sociology and cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Bergoffen, Debra, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/beauvoir/ Simone de Beauvoir]", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; This view asserts that the relationship between gender and sex (presence of genitals/gonads) is not causally determinate. That is, that one may have the genitals of one sex while having the gender of another.&lt;ref&gt;Connell, Robert William: Gender and Power, Cambridge: University Press 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

There continues to be debate on the subject. [[Simon Baron-Cohen]], a Cambridge University professor of psychology and psychiatry claims 'the female brain is predominantly "hard-wired" for empathy, while the male brain is predominantly "hard-wired" for understanding and building systems'.&lt;ref&gt;Baron-Cohen, S (2003) The Essential Difference: men, women and the extreme male brain.

Several studies have been conducted looking at the gender roles of [[intersex]] children.

One such study looked at female infants with [[adrenal hyperplasia]], and who had excess male hormone levels, but were thought to be females and raised as such by their parents. These girls were more likely to express masculine traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berenbaum|first1=Sheri A.|last2=Hines|first2=Melissa|year=1992|title=Early androgens are related to childhood sex-typed toy preferences|work=Psychological Science 3|pages=203–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psy2.ucsd.edu/~mgorman/Berenbaum.pdf|title=Gorman Lab|author=Sven Design|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another study looked at 18 infants with the intersex condition [[5-alpha reductase deficiency]], and XY chromosomes, assigned female at birth. At adult age only one individual maintained a female role, all the others being stereotypically male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Imperato-McGinley|first=J|author2=Peterson, RE |author3=Gautier, T |author4= Sturla, E |title=Androgens and the evolution of male-gender identity among male pseudohermaphrodites with 5alpha-reductase deficiency.|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=31 May 1979|volume=300|issue=22|pages=1233–7|pmid=431680|doi=10.1056/NEJM197905313002201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a third study, 14 male children born with [[cloacal exstrophy]] and assigned female at birth, including through [[intersex medical interventions]].

[[Sandra Bem|Dr. Sandra Lipsitz Bem]] is a psychologist who developed the [[gender schema theory]], based on the combination of aspects of the [[social cognitive theory|social learning theory]] and the [[theory of cognitive development|cognitive-development theory]] of sex role acquisition, to explain how individuals come to use gender as an organizing category in all aspects of their life. In 1971, she created the [[Bem Sex-Role Inventory]] to measure how well an individual conformed to a traditional gender role, characterizing those tested as having masculine, feminine, androgynous, or undifferentiated personality. She believed that through gender-schematic processing, a person spontaneously sorts attributes and behaviors into masculine and feminine categories, and that therefore individuals processes information and regulate their behavior based on whatever definitions of [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]] their culture provides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bem |first=Sandra L. |title=Gender schema theory: A cognitive account of sex typing |journal=Psychological Review|date=July 1981|volume=88|issue=4|pages=354–364|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.88.4.354 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are differences in average capabilities of various kinds (E.g. better average balance and endurance in females or greater average physical size in males) between the sexes{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} the capabilities of some members of one sex will fall within the range of capabilities needed for tasks conventionally assigned to the other sex. [[Eve Shapiro]], author of ''Gender Circuits'', explains that "gender, like other social categories, is both a personal identity and a culture set of behaviors, beliefs and values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Gender_Circuits.html?id=FQ67HsfI1rUC |last1=Shapiro|first1=Eve|title=Gender circuits : bodies and identities in a technological age|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780415996952|page=9&lt;!--|pages=298--&gt;|edition=1.|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{off topic sentence}}

Research at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center has also shown that gender roles may be biological among primates. Yerkes researchers studied the interactions of 11 male and 23 female [[Rhesus monkey]]s with human toys, both wheeled and plush. The males played mostly with the wheeled toys while the females played with both types equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yerkes.emory.edu/about/news/developmental_cognitive_neuroscience/toy_preferences.html |title=Yerkes Researchers Find Sex Differences in Monkey Toy Preferences Similar to Humans |publisher=Yerkes National Primate Research Center |date=10 April 2008 |accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Study co-author Kim Wallen has, however, warned against overinterpreting the results as the color and size of the toys may also have been factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13596-male-monkeys-prefer-boys-toys.html |title=Male monkeys prefer boys' toys |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2008.03.008 |publisher=New Scientist |accessdate=17 April 2010 |journal=Hormones and Behavior |date=2008 |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=359–364 |first=Janice M. |last=Hassett|pmc=2583786 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas of appropriate behavior according to gender vary among cultures and era, although some aspects receive more widespread attention than others. [[R.W. Connell]] in ''Men, Masculinities and Feminism''&lt;ref&gt;Connell, Raewyn, Ph.D. "Men, Masculinities and Feminism." Social Alternatives July 1997: 7-10. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; claims:

{{quote|There are cultures where it has been normal, not exceptional, for men to have homosexual relations. There have been periods in 'Western' history when the modern convention that men suppress displays of emotion did not apply at all, when men were demonstrative about their feeling for their friends. Mateship in the Australian outback last century is a case in point.}}

There are huge areal differences in attitudes towards appropriate gender roles. In the ''[[World Values Survey]]'', responders were asked if they thought that wage work should be restricted to only men in the case of shortage in jobs: in Iceland the proportion that agreed with the proposition was 3.6%; while in Egypt it was 94.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fortin | first1 = Nicole | year = 2005 | title = Gender Role Attitudes and the Labour Market Outcomes of Women Across OECD Countries | url = | journal = Oxford Review of Economic Policy | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 416–438 | doi=10.1093/oxrep/gri024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attitudes have also varied historically, for example, in Europe, during the Middle Ages, women were commonly associated with roles related to medicine and healing.&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrenreich|first=Barbara|title=Witches, Midwives and Nurses: A History of Women Healers|year=2010|publisher=The Feminist Press|isbn=0-912670-13-4|pages=44–87|edition=2nd|author2=Deirdre English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the rise of [[witch-hunt]]s across Europe and the institutionalization of medicine, these roles became exclusively associated with men&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich" /&gt; but in the last few decades these roles have become largely gender-neutral in Western society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boulis|first=Ann K.|title=The changing face of medicine: women doctors and the evolution of health care in America|year=2010|publisher=ILR|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=0-8014-7662-3|author2=Jacobs, Jerry A.|quote=Encouraging one's daughter to pursue a career in medicine is no longer an unusual idea… Americans are now more likely to report that they feel comfortable recommending a career in medicine for a young woman than for a young man.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vern Bullough]] stated that homosexual communities are generally more tolerant of switching gender roles.&lt;ref name="Bullough"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bullough |first=Vern L.|title=Crossdressing, Sex, and Gender|year=1993|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press. 1993 |isbn=978-0-8122-1431-4|page=390|edition=1st|author2=Bonnie Bullough}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, someone with a masculine voice, a five o'clock shadow (or a fuller beard), an [[Adam's apple]], wearing a woman's dress and high heels, carrying a purse would most likely draw ridicule or other unfriendly attention in ordinary social contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith, Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity, Routledge, New York, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam, Judith, Female Masculinity, Duke University Press, Durham and London, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Julia, Straub, Kristina; Eds, Body Guards: The Cultural Politics of Gender Ambiguity, Routledge, London, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the dominant class sees this form of gender expression as unacceptable, inappropriate, or perhaps threatening, these individuals are significantly more likely to experience discrimination and harassment both in their personal lives and from their employer.&lt;ref&gt;https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/issues/2011/06/pdf/workplace_discrimination.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender roles may be a means through which one expresses their [[gender identity]], but they may also be employed as a means of exerting [[social control]], and individuals may experience negative social consequences for violating them.&lt;ref&gt;Hackman, J.R.

===Religion===
{{main article|Gender and religion}}

Different religious and cultural groups within one country may have different norms that they attempt to "police" within their own group, including gender norms.

'''Christianity'''
[[Image:Cranach the Younger, Lucas - Christ and the adulteress.jpg|thumb|''Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery''&lt;br&gt; [[Hermitage Museum]], Russia.]]
{{main article|Gender roles in Christianity}}
{{see also|Christian views on marriage}}

''I Corinthians,'' 11:14 and 15 indicates that it is inappropriate for a man to wear his hair long, and good for a woman to wear her hair long.

The roles of women in Christianity can vary considerably today as they have varied historically since the first century New Testament church. This is especially true in marriage and in formal ministry positions within certain Christian denominations, churches, and [[parachurch organizations]].

Many leadership roles in the organized church have been restricted to males. In the [[Sex, gender and the Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] churches, only men may serve as priests or deacons; only males serve in senior leadership positions such as [[pope]], [[patriarch]], and [[bishop]]. Women may serve as [[abbess]]es. Most mainstream [[Protestants|Protestant]] denominations are beginning to relax their longstanding constraints on ordaining women to be ministers, though some large groups are tightening their constraints in reaction. [[Charismatic]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] churches have embraced the ordination of women since their founding.

Christian traditions that officially recognize ''saints'' as persons of exceptional holiness of life do list women in that group. Most prominent is [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, mother of Jesus]] who is highly revered throughout Christianity, particularly in Roman Catholicism where she is considered the "Mother of God". Women prominent in Christianity have included contemporaries of Jesus, subsequent theologians, abbesses, mystics, [[doctors of the church]], founders of religious orders, military leaders, monarchs and martyrs, evidencing the variety of roles played by women within the life of Christianity. [[Paul the Apostle and women|Paul the Apostle]] held women in high regard and worthy of prominent positions in the church, though he was careful not to encourage disregard for the [[New Testament household codes]], also known as New Testament Domestic Codes or ''Haustafelen'', of [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman law]] in the first century.

'''Islam'''
{{see also|Marriage in Islam}}

In the [[United Arab Emirates]], non-Muslim Western women can wear crop tops, whereas Muslim women are expected to dress much more [[modesty|modestly]], due to the injunction on women in Islam to dress modestly at all times when in public. In some Muslim countries, these differences are sometimes even codified in law.

In some Muslim-majority countries, however, even non-Muslim women are expected to follow Muslim female gender norms and Islamic law to a certain extent, such as by covering their hair. This norm may sometimes be objected to by women visiting from other countries - but they may nevertheless decide to comply on pragmatic grounds, in the interests of their own safety. For example, in Egypt, women who do not dress "[[modesty|modestly]]" - whether they are Muslims or not - may be perceived to be akin to prostitutes by men.

[[Muhammad]] described the high status of mothers in both of the major hadith Collections (Bukhari and Muslim). One famous account is:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;"A man asked the Prophet: 'Whom should I honor most?' The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother!'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your father'"&lt;/blockquote&gt;In Muslim culture, women are seen as equal to men, but the degree to which that is honored is largely cultural. While some cultures encourage men and women to take on the same roles, others promote a more traditional, less dominant role for the women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Global Connections .

'''Hinduism'''
{{main article|God and gender in Hinduism}}
Hindu deities are more ambiguously gendered than deities of other world religions, such as Christianity, Islam, and others. This informs female and males relations, and informs how the differences between males and females are understood&lt;ref&gt;Gopal, Madan (1990). K.S. Gautam, ed. India through the ages. Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:God marriage AS.jpg|thumb|upright|Image of [[Ardhanarishvara]]]] However, in a religious cosmology like [[Hinduism]], which prominently features female and androgynous deities, some gender transgression is allowed. This group is known as the [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijras]], and has a long tradition of performing in important rituals, such as the birth of sons and weddings. Despite this allowance for transgression, Hindu cultural traditions portray women in contradictory ways. On one hand, women’s fertility is given great value, and on the other, female sexuality is depicted as potentially dangerous and destructive.&lt;ref name="Peletz"&gt;Peletz, Michael Gates.

===Studies on marriage in the U.S.===
{{see also|Marriage}}

Marriage is an institution that influences gender roles, inequality, and change.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = C | year = 2012 | title = Introduction: Marriage, gender relations and social change | url = | journal = Journal of Development Studies | volume = 48 | issue = 1| pages = 1–9 | doi=10.1080/00220388.2011.629653}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, gender roles are communicated by the media, social interaction, and language. Through these platforms society has influenced individuals to fulfill the stereotypical gender roles within a heterosexual marriage starting out at a young age. Although traditionally, society claims that roles within a heterosexual marriage should be decided based on one’s biological sex, today individuals are determining their own roles for themselves, ultimately creating equal partnerships.

'''Communication of Gender Roles in the United States'''

In the U.S., marriage roles are generally decided based on gender. For approximately the past seven decades, heterosexual marriage roles have been defined for men and women based on society’s expectations and the influence of the media.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Gauntlett, D. (2008). ''Media, gender and identity: An introduction''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Men and women are typically associated with certain social roles dependent upon the personality traits associated with those roles.&lt;ref name="Gerber, G. L. 1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gerber | first1 = G. L. | year = 1988 | title = Leadership roles and the gender stereotype traits | doi = 10.1007/BF00288051 | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 18 | issue = 11–12| pages = 649–668}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the role of the homemaker is associated with a woman and the role of a breadwinner is associated with a male. Typically, women are concerned with caring for the family and the home while men are typically providing for the family. This ultimately portrays the man as a leader and the woman as the follower.&lt;ref name="Gerber, G. L. 1988"/&gt;

In the U.S., single men are outnumbered by single women at a ratio of 100 single women to 86 single men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pritchard|first=Justin|title=Men hold the edge on gender gap odds|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-6970963.html|newspaper=Oakland Tribune|date=21 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; though never-married men over the age of 15 outnumber women by a 5:4 ratio (33.9% to 27.3%) according to the 2006 U.S. Census American Community Survey. The results are varied between age groups, with 118 single men per 100 single women in their 20s, versus 33 single men to 100 single women over 65.&lt;ref&gt;Facts for features: Valentine's Day U.S. Census Bureau Report 7 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The numbers also vary between countries. For example, China has many more young men than young women, and this disparity is expected to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCurry|first=Justin|title=40m bachelors and no women ... the birth of a new problem for China|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/09/china.justinmccurry|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 March 2004|author2=Allison, Rebecca|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regions with recent conflict such as Chechnya, women greatly outnumber men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Polygamy proposal for Chechen men|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4610396.stm|newspaper=BBC News|date=13 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a cross-cultural study by [[David Buss]], men and women were asked to rank the importance of certain traits in a long term partner. Both men and women ranked "kindness" and "intelligence" as the two most important factors. Men valued beauty and youth more highly than women, while women valued financial and social status more highly than men.

'''Media'''

In today’s society, media saturates nearly every aspect of one's life. It seems inevitable for society to be influenced by the media and what it is portraying.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Roles are gendered, meaning that both males and females are viewed and treated differently according to their biological sex, and because gendered roles are learned, the media has a direct impact on individuals. Thinking about the way in which couples act on romantic television shows or movies and the way women are portrayed as passive in magazine ads, reveals a lot about how gender roles are viewed in society and in heterosexual marriages.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Traditional gendered roles view the man as a “pro-creator, a protector, and a provider,” and the woman as “pretty and polite but not too aggressive, not too outspoken and not too smart.” &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marriage and Families: Changes, Choices, and Constrains|last=Benokraits|first=Nijole|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2002|isbn=0-13-034177-0|location=New Jersey|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media aids in society conforming to these traditional gendered views. People learn through imitation and social-interaction both in the physical world and through the media; television, magazines, advertisements, newspapers, the internet, etc.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

It has been presented in the journal article by [[Emerald Group Publishing Limited]] that adolescent girls have been effected by the stereotypical view of women in media. Girls feel pressurised and stressed to achieve a particular appearance and there have been highly worrying consequences for the young girls if they fail to achieve this look. These consequences have ranged from anxiety to eating disorders. Young girls in an experiment of this journal article describe pictures on women in advertisements as unrealistic and fake. They are dressed in little and revealing clothing which sexualised the women and expose their thin figures, that are gazed upon by the public, creating an issue with stereotyping in the media.

'''Social Interaction'''

Gendered roles in heterosexual marriages are learned through imitation. People learn what society views as appropriate gender behaviors from imitating the repetition of actions by one’s role-model or parent of the same biological sex.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Imitation in the physical world that impacts one’s gendered roles often comes from role-modeling parents, peers, teachers, and other significant figures in one’s life. In a marriage, oftentimes each person’s gendered roles are determined by their parents. If the wife grew up imitating the actions of traditional parents, and the husband non-traditional parents, their views on marital roles would be different.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One way people can acquire these stereotypical roles through a reward and punishment system. When a little girl imitates her mother by performing the traditional domestic duties she is often rewarded by being told she is doing a good job. Non traditionally, if a little boy was performing the same tasks he would more likely be punished due to acting feminine.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Because society holds these expected roles for men and women within a marriage, it creates a mold for children to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, L. L. (2015). ''Gender roles: A sociological perspective''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Changing Gender Roles in Marriage'''

Over the years, gender roles have continued to change and have a significant impact on the institution of marriage. Gender roles can be defined as the behaviors, values, and attitudes that a society considers appropriate for both male and female.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Motivated by the Women's Rights Movement and various other movements gender roles have begun to change, resulting in the changing economic landscape, women entering the workplace and many more. Traditionally, men and women had completely opposing roles, men were seen as the provider for the family and women were seen as the caretakers of both the home and the family.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, in today’s society the division of roles are starting to blur. More and more individuals are adapting non-traditional gender roles into their marriage in order to share responsibilities. This revolutionary view on gender roles seeks out equality between sexes. In today’s society it is more likely that a man and woman are both providers for their family. More and more women are entering the workforce while more men are contributing to household duties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite the fact that there is still a gap between gender roles, today, roles are less gendered and more equal in comparison to how they were traditionally.

===Changing roles===

Husbands were typically working farmers - the providers. Wives typically cared for the home and the children.

Societies can change such that the gender roles rapidly change. The 21st century has seen a shift in gender roles due to multiple factors such as new family structures, education, media, and several others. A 2003 survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated that about 1/3 of wives earn more than their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/27/business/27instincts.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=M.P. | last=Dunleavey | title=A Breadwinner Rethinks Gender Roles | date=27 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the importance of education emphasized nationwide, and the access of college degrees (online, for example), women have begun furthering their education.

Fathers are also becoming more involved with raising their children, instead of the responsibility resting solely with the mother.

According to the Pew Research Center, the number of stay-at-home fathers in the US nearly doubled in the period from 1989 to 2012, from 1.1 million to 2.0 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/06/05/growing-number-of-dads-home-with-the-kids/|title=Growing Number of Stay-at-Home Dads - Pew Research Center|date=5 June 2014|work=Pew Research Center’s Social &amp; Demographic Trends Project|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend appears to be mirrored in a number of countries including the UK, Canada and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/9822271/Rise-in-stay-at-home-fathers-fuelled-by-growing-numbers-of-female-breadwinners.html|title=Rise in stay-at-home fathers fuelled by growing numbers of female breadwinners|author1=Louisa Peacock |author2=Sam Marsden |date=23 January 2013|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=14 June 2015|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/parenting/stay-at-home-dads-on-the-rise-increasingly-because-they-want-to-be/article19014624/|title=Stay-at-home dads on the rise – increasingly because they want to be|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=14 June 2015|location=Toronto|date=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/06/sweden-sees-boom-in-stay-at-home-dads/|title=Sweden sees boom in stay-at-home dads|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pew also found that, at least in the US, public opinion in general appears to show a substantial bias toward favoring a mother as a care-taker versus a father, regardless of any shift in actual roles each plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/29/breadwinner-moms/|title=Breadwinner Moms|date=29 May 2013|work=Pew Research Center’s Social &amp; Demographic Trends Project|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender equality allows gender roles to become less distinct and according to Donnalyn Pompper, is the reason "men no longer own breadwinning identities and, like women, their bodies are objectified in mass media images."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pompper | first1 = Donnalyn | year = 2010 | title = Masculinities, The Metrosexual, And Media Images: Across Dimensions Of Age And Ethnicity | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 63 | issue = 9/10| pages = 682–696 | doi=10.1007/s11199-010-9870-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[LGBT rights movement]] has played a role increasing pro-gay attitudes, which according to Brian McNair, are expressed by many metrosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, Brian.

According to Professor [[Lei Chang]], gender attitudes within the domains of work and domestic roles can be measured using a cross-cultural gender role attitudes test. Psychological processes of the East have historically been analysed using Western models (or ''instruments'') that have been 'translated', which, potentially, is a more far-reaching process than linguistic translation. Some North American instruments for assessing gender role attitudes include:
* Attitudes Towards Women Scale,
* Sex-Role Egalitarian Scale, and
* Sex-Role Ideology Scale. 
Through such tests, it is known that American Southerners exhibit less egalitarian gender views than their northern counterparts, demonstrating that gender views are inevitably affected by an individual's culture, and may differ among compatriots whose 'cultures' are a few hundred miles apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chang | first1 = Lei | year = 1999 | title = Gender Role Egalitarian Attitudes in Beijing, Hong Kong, Florida, and Michigan | url = | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 30 | issue = 6| pages = 722–41 | doi=10.1177/0022022199030006004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although existing studies have generally focused on gender views or attitudes that are work-related, there has so far not been a study on specific domestic roles. Supporting Hofstede's 1980 findings, that "high masculinity cultures are associated with low percentages of women holding professional and technical employment", test values for work-related egalitarianism were lower for Chinese than for Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede&lt;/ref&gt;{{Specify|date=July 2016}} This is supported by the proportion of women that held professional jobs in China (far less than that of America), the data clearly indicating the limitations on opportunities open to women in contemporary Eastern society. In contrast, there was no difference between the viewpoint of Chinese and Americans regarding domestic gender roles.

A study by Richard Bagozzi, Nancy Wong and Youjae Yi, examines the interaction between culture and gender that produces distinct patterns of association between positive and negative emotions.&lt;ref name="Bag"/&gt; The United States was considered a more 'independence-based culture', while China was considered '''inter''dependence-based'. In the US people tend to experience emotions in terms of opposition whereas in China, they do so in dialectical terms (i.e., those of logical argumentation and contradictory forces). The study continued with sets of psychological tests among university students in Beijing and in Michigan. The fundamental goals of the research were to show that "gender differences in emotions are adaptive for the differing roles that males and females play in the culture". The evidence for differences in gender role was found during the [[socialization]] in work experiment, proving that "women are socialized to be more expressive of their feelings and to show this to a greater extent in facial expressions and gestures, as well as by verbal means".&lt;ref name="Bag"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bagozzi | first1 = Richard P. | last2 = Wong | first2 = Nancy | last3 = Yi | first3 = Youjae | year = 1999 | title = The Role of Culture and Gender in the Relationship between Positive and Negative Affect | url = | journal = Cognition &amp; Emotion | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 641–72 | doi=10.1080/026999399379023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study extended to the biological characteristics of both gender groups — for a higher association between PA and NA hormones in memory for women, the cultural patterns became more evident for women than for men.

==Communication==
{{See also|Language and gender|Gender differences in social network service use|Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures}}
Gender communication is viewed as a form of intercultural communication, and gender is both an influence on and a product of communication.

Communication plays a large role in the process in which people become male or female because each gender is taught different linguistic practices.Gender is dictated by society through expectations of behavior and appearances, and then is shared from one person to another, by the process of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender in Communication, A Critical Introduction|publisher = SAGE Publications|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-4522-2009-3|location = |pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender does not create communication, communication creates gender.&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancisco, Victoria L., Catherine Helen Palczewski, and Danielle Dick McGeough. ''Gender in communication a critical introduction''. Los Angeles: Sage, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, females are often more expressive and intuitive in their communication, while males tend to be instrumental and competitive. In addition, there are differences in accepted communication behaviors for males and females. To improve communication between genders, people who identify as either male or female must understand the differences between each gender.&lt;ref&gt;"Gender Differences in Communication." Intercultural Communication: A Global Reader. Ed. Fred E. Jandt. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2004. 221–29. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

As found by Cara Tigue (McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada) [http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138(11)00102-4/abstract the importance of powerful vocal delivery for women] could not be underestimated, as famously described in accounts of [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2011/nov/15/woman-lower-tone-voice-successful Margaret Thatcher's years in power].)

===Nonverbal communication===
Hall published an observational study on nonverbal gender differences and discussed the cultural reasons for these differences.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, J. A. (1990). Nonverbal sex differences: Accuracy of communication and expressive style. Baltimore, MD, US: Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In her study, she noted women smile and laugh more and have a better understanding of nonverbal cues. She believed women were encouraged to be more emotionally expressive in their language, causing them to be more developed in nonverbal communication.

Men, on the other hand, were taught to be less expressive, to suppress their emotions, and to be less nonverbally active in communication and more sporadic in their use of nonverbal cues. Most studies researching nonverbal communication described women as being more expressively and judgmentally accurate in nonverbal communication when it was linked to emotional expression; other nonverbal expressions were similar or the same for both genders.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, A. H. (2000). Gender and emotion: Social psychologica perspectives. Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

McQuiston and Morris also noted a major difference in men and women’s nonverbal communication. They found that men tend to show body language linked to dominance, like eye contact and interpersonal distance, more than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McQuiston | first1 = D. | last2 = Morris | first2 = K. A. | year = 2009 | title = Gender differences in communication: Implications for salespeople | url = | journal = Journal of Selling &amp; Major Account Management | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 54–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication and gender cultures===
[[File:Personality and gender word cloud for social media.png|thumb|upright|Words, s, and topics most highly distinguishing English-speaking females and males in social media in 2013]]
According to Julia Wood, there are distinct communication 'cultures' for women and men in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, J (2010) Gendered lives: Communication, gender and culture. Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; Wood believes that in addition to female and male communication cultures, there are also specific communication cultures for African Americans, older people, Indian Native Americans, gay men, lesbians, and people with disabilities. According to Wood, it is generally thought that biological sex is behind the distinct ways of communicating, but in reality the root is "gender".&lt;ref&gt;Wood, J (2010) Gendered lives: Communication, gender and culture. Cengage Learning. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Maltz and Broker’s research suggested that the games children play may contribute to socializing children into [[Masculinity|masculine]] and [[Femininity|feminine]] gender roles:&lt;ref name="maltz"&gt;Maltz, D., &amp; Borker, R. (1982). A cultural approach to male-female miscommunication. In J. Gumperz (Ed.), Language and social identity (pp. 196–216). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, girls being encouraged to play "house" may promotes stereotypically feminine traits, and may promote interpersonal relationships as playing house does not necessarily have fixed rules or objectives; boys tended to play more competitive and adversarial team sports with structured, predetermined goals and a range of confined strategies.

===Communication and sexual desire===
Mets, et al.&lt;ref name="metts"&gt;Metts, S., Sprecher, S., &amp; Regan, P. C. (1998). Communication and sexual desire. In P. A. Andersen &amp; L. K. Guerrero (Eds.) Handbook of communication and emotion. (pp. 354–377). San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; explain that [[Libido|sexual desire]] is linked to emotions and communicative expression. Communication is central in expressing sexual desire and 'complicated emotional states', and is also the 'mechanism for negotiating the relationship implications of [[Human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] and emotional meanings'.

Gender differences appear to exist in communicating sexual desire, for example, masculine people are generally perceived to be more interested in sex than feminine people, and research suggests that masculine people are more likely than feminine people to express their sexual interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R | last2 = Catanese | first2 = K | last3 = Vohs | first3 = K | year = 2001 | title = Is there a gender difference in strength of sex drive? Theoretical views, conceptual distinctions, and a review of relevant evidence | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 242–273 | doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0503_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This may be greatly affected by masculine people being less inhibited by [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]] for expressing their desire, being more aware of their sexual desire or succumbing to the expectation of their gender culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seal | first1 = D | last2 = Ehrhardt | first2 = A | year = 2003 | title = Masculinity and urban men: Perceived scripts for courtship, romantic, and sexual interactions with women | url = | journal = Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality: an International Journal for Research, Intervention and Care | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 295–319 | doi=10.1080/136910501171698}}&lt;/ref&gt; When feminine people employ tactics to show their sexual desire, they are typically more indirect in nature. On the other hand, it is known masculinity is associated with aggressive behavior in all mammals, and most likely explains at least part of the fact that masculine people are more likely to express their sexual interest. This is known as the [[Challenge hypothesis]].

Various studies show different communication strategies with a feminine person refusing a masculine person's sexual interest. Some research, like that of Murnen,&lt;ref name="murnen"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Perot |first1= |last2=Byrne Murnen |first2=SK |last3=Perot |first3=A |last4=Byrne |first4=D |year=1989 |title = Coping with unwanted sexual activity: Normative responses, situational determinants, and individual differences |url= |journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 85–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that when feminine people offer refusals, the refusals are verbal and typically direct. When masculine people do not comply with this refusal, feminine people offer stronger and more direct refusals. However, research from Perper and Weis&lt;ref name="perper"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perper | first1 = T. | last2 = Weis | first2 = D. L. | year = 1987 | title = Proceptive and rejective strategies of U.S. and Canadian college women | url = | journal = The Journal of Sex Research | volume = 23 | issue = 4| pages = 455–480 | doi=10.1080/00224498709551385}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that rejection includes acts of avoidance, creating distractions, making excuses, departure, hinting, arguments to delay, etc. These differences in refusal communication techniques are just one example of the importance of communicative competence for both masculine and feminine gender cultures.

==Gender stereotypes==

[[File:Glaspalast München 1883 064.jpg|thumb|An 1883 German illustration of children playing house]]
A 1992 study tested gender stereotypes and labeling within young children.&lt;ref name="fagot"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fagot | first1 = Beverly I. | last2 = Leinbach | first2 = Mary D. | last3 = O'Boyle | first3 = Cherie | title = Gender labeling, gender stereotyping, and parenting behaviors | journal = [[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]] | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 225–230 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] via [[PsycINFO|PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.28.2.225 | date = March 1992 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.28.2.225 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers divided this into two different studies, the first investigated how children identified the differences between gender labels of boys and girls, the second study looked at both gender labeling and stereotyping in the relationship of mother and child.

Within the first study, 23 children between the ages of 2 and 7 underwent a series of gender labelling and gender stereotyping tests consisting of showing the children either pictures of males and females or objects such as a hammer or a broom then identifying or labeling those to a certain gender. The results of these tests showed that children under 3 years could make gender-stereotypic associations.&lt;ref name="fagot" /&gt;

The second study looked at gender labelling and stereotyping in the relationship of mother and child using three separate methods. The first consisted of identifying gender labeling and stereotyping, essentially the same method as the first study. The second consisted of behavioral observations, which looked at ten-minute play sessions with mother and child using gender specific toys.

The third was a series of questionnaires such as an "Attitude Toward Women Scale", "[[Personal Attributes Questionnaire]]", and "Schaefer and Edgerton Scale" which looked at the family values of the mother.&lt;ref name="fagot" /&gt;

The results of these studies showed the same as the first study with regards to labelling and stereotyping.

They also identified in the second method that the mothers positive reactions and responses to same-sex or opposite-sex toys played a role in how children identified them. Within the third method the results found that the mothers of the children who passed the “Gender Labeling Test”, had more traditional family values. These two studies, conducted by Beverly I. Fagot, Mar D. Leinbach and Cherie O'Boyle, showed that gender stereotyping and labeling is acquired at a very young age, and that social interactions and associations play a large role in how genders are identified.&lt;ref name="fagot" /&gt;

[[Virginia Woolf]], in the 1920s, made the point: 'It is obvious that the values of women differ very often from the values which have been made by the other sex. Yet it is the masculine values that prevail'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Woolf | first = Virginia | author-link = Virginia Woolf | title = [[A Room of One's Own|A room of one's own]] | publisher = Hogarth Press | location = New York | year = 1929 | page = 76 | oclc = 31499943}}&lt;/ref&gt; remade sixty years later by psychologist [[Carol Gilligan]] who used it to show that psychological tests of maturity have generally been based on masculine parameters, and so tended to show that women were less 'mature'. Gilligan countered this in her ground-breaking work, ''[[In a Different Voice]]'', holding that maturity in women is shown in terms of different, but equally important, human values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gilligan |first = Carol | author-link = Carol Gilligan | title = [[In a Different Voice|In a different voice]] |publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780674445444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender stereotypes are extremely common in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Brewer | first = Holly | title = List of gender stereotypes | url = http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/15910/1/List-of-Gender-Stereotypes.html | date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Gender and gender identity at a glance | url = http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/sexual-orientation-gender/gender-gender-identity-26530.htm | website = plannedparenthood.org | publisher = Planned Parenthood Federation of America Inc. | date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons this may be is simply because it is easier on the brain to stereotype (see [[Heuristics in judgment and decision-making|Heuristics]]).

The brain has limited perceptual and memory systems, so it categorizes information into fewer and simpler units which allows for more efficient information processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = Carol Lynn | last2 = Halverson, Jr. | first2 = Charles F. | title = A schematic processing model of sex typing and stereotyping in children | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 1119–1134 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.2307/1129498 | jstor = 1129498 | date = December 1981 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1129498 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender stereotypes appear to have an effect at an early age. In one study, the effects of gender stereotypes on children's mathematical abilities were tested. In this study of American children between the ages of six and ten, it was found that the children, as early as the second grade, demonstrated the gender stereotype that mathematics is a 'boy's subject'. This may show that the mathematical self-belief is influenced before the age in which there are discernible differences in mathematical achievement.&lt;ref name="Cvencek"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cvencek | first1 = Dario | last2 = Meltzoff | first2 = Andrew N. | last3 = Greenwald | first3 = Anthony G. | title = Math–gender stereotypes in elementary school children | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 82 | issue = 3 | pages = 766–779 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01529.x | date = May–June 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01529.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study of gender stereotypes it was found that parents' stereotypes interact with the sex of their child to directly influence the parents' beliefs about the child's abilities. In turn, parents' beliefs about their child directly influence their child's self-perceptions, and both the parents' stereotypes and the child's self-perceptions influence the child's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Jacobs | first = Janis E. | title = Influence of gender stereotypes on parent and child mathematics attitudes | journal = [[Journal of Educational Psychology]] | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 518–527 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] via [[PsycINFO|PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/0022-0663.83.4.518 | date = December 1991 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-0663.83.4.518 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stereotype threat]] is being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group.&lt;ref name="SteeleAronson"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Steele | first1 = Claude M. | last2 = Aronson | first2 = Joshua | author-link1 = Claude Steele | title = Stereotype threat and the intellectual test performance of African Americans | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 69 | issue = 5 | pages = 797–811 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] via [[PsycINFO|PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.797 | pmid = 7473032 | date = November 1995 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.797 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://users.nber.org/~sewp/events/2005.01.14/Bios+Links/Good-rec2-Steele_&amp;_Aronson_95.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of gender it is the implicit belief in gender stereotype that women perform worse than men in mathematics, which is proposed to lead to lower performance by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Spencer | first1 = Steven J. | last2 = Steele | first2 = Claude M. | last3 = Quinn | first3 = Diane M. | author-link2 = Claude Steele | title = Stereotype threat and women's math performance | journal = [[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]] | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–28 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1006/jesp.1998.1373 | date = January 1999 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1006/jesp.1998.1373 | ref = harv | postscript = . }} [http://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/carnegie/learning_resources/LAW_PGCHE/SteeleandQuinnStereotypeThreat.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108184501/http://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/carnegie/learning_resources/LAW_PGCHE/SteeleandQuinnStereotypeThreat.pdf |date=8 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent review article of stereotype threat research related to the relationship between gender and mathematical abilities concluded 'that although stereotype threat may affect some women, the existing state of knowledge does not support the current level of enthusiasm for this [as a] mechanism underlying the gender gap in mathematics'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stoet | first1 = Gijsbert | last2 = Geary | first2 = David C. | title = Can stereotype threat explain the gender gap in mathematics performance and achievement? | journal = [[Review of General Psychology]] | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 93–102 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] via [[PsycINFO|PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/a0026617 | date = March 2012 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0026617 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study, Deaux and her colleagues found that most people think women are ''more'' ''nurturant'', but ''less self-assertive'' than men. and that this belief is indicated universally, but that this awareness is related to women's ''role''. To put it another way, women do not have an ''inherently'' nurturant personality, rather that a nurturing personality is acquired by whoever happens to be doing the housework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Deaux | first1 = Kay | last2 = Lewis | first2 = Laurie L. | title = Structure of gender stereotypes: interrelationships among components and gender label | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 46 | issue = 5 | pages = 991–1004 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] via [[PsycINFO|PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.46.5.991 | date = May 1984 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.46.5.991 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the study of Jean Lipman-Blumen, women who grew up following traditional gender roles from childhood were less likely to want to be highly educated while women brought up with the view that men and women are equal were more likely to want higher education.

[[Gender stereotypes]] are frequently brought up as one disadvantage to women during the hiring process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorman|first1=Elizabeth H.|title=Gender Stereotypes, Same-Gender Preferences, and Organizational Variation in the Hiring of Women: Evidence from Law Firms|journal=American Sociological Review|date=August 2005|volume=70|issue=4|doi=10.1177/000312240507000408|pages=702–728}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as one explanation of the lack of women in key organizational positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heilman|first1=Madeline E.|title=Description and Prescription: How Gender Stereotypes Prevent Women's Ascent Up the Organizational Ladder|journal=Journal of Social Issues|date=2001|volume=57|issue=4|doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00234|pages=657–674}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Management and similar leader positions are often perceived to be "masculine" in type, meaning they are assumed to require aggressiveness, competitiveness, strength and independence. These traits do not line up with the perceived traditional female gender role stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heilman|first1=Madeline E.|last2=Eagly|first2=Alice H.|title=Gender Stereotypes Are Alive, Well, and Busy Producing Workplace Discrimination|journal=Industrial and Organizational Psychology|date=2008|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This is often referred to as the "lack of fit" model which describes the dynamics of the gender bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heilman|first=Madeline E.|year=1983|title=Sex Bias in Work Settings: The Lack of Fit Model|url=|journal=Research in Organizational Behavior|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Therefore, the perception that women do not possess these "masculine" qualities, limits their ability to be hired or promoted into managerial positions.

One's performance at work is also evaluated based on one's gender. If a female and a male worker show the same performance, the implications of that performance vary depending on the person's gender and on who observes the performance; if a man performs exceedingly well he is perceived as driven or goal-oriented and generally seen in a positive light while a woman showing a similar performance is often described using adjectives with negative connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Shelley E.|last2=Fiske|first2=Susan T.|last3=Etcoff|first3=Nancy L.|last4=Ruderman|first4=Audrey J.|title=Categorical and Contextual Bases of Person Memory and Stereotyping|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1978|volume=36|issue=7|pages=778|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.36.7.778 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Female performance is therefore not evaluated neutrally or unbiased and stereotyped in ways to deem their equivalent levels and quality of work as instead of lesser value.

Consequently, that gender stereotype filter leads to a lack of fair evaluation and, in turn, to fewer women occupying higher paying positions. Gender stereotypes contain women at certain, lower levels; getting trapped within the [[glass ceiling]]. While the number of [[women in the workforce]] occupying management positions is slowly increasing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kalysh|first1=Kateryina|last2=Kulik|first2=Carol T.|last3=Perera|first3=Sanjeewa|title=Help or hindrance?

In relation to white women, [[women of color]] are disproportionally affected by the negative influence their gender has on their chances in the labor market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Browne|first1=Irene|last2=Misra|first2=Joya|title=The Intersection of Gender and Race in the Labor Market|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|date=2003|volume=29|issue=1|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100016|pages=487–513}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, women held only 14.7% of Fortune 500 board seats with 79% of them being white and 21% being women of color.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This difference is understood through [[intersectionality]], a term describing the multiple and intersecting oppressions and individual might experience. Activists during [[second-wave feminism]] have also used the term "horizontal oppressions" to describe this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Doing Feminist Theory: From Modernity to Postmodernity|last=Mann|first=Susan Archer|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=172|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that women of color in addition to the glass ceiling, face a "concrete wall" or a "sticky floor" to better visualize the barriers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Liberal feminism|Liberal feminist]] theory states that due to these systemic factors of oppression and discrimination, women are often deprived of equal work experiences because they are not provided equal opportunities on the basis of legal rights. Liberal feminists further propose that an end needs to be put to discrimination based on gender through legal means, leading to equality and major economic redistributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scientific Reproduction of Gender Inequality: A Discourse Analysis of Research Texts on Women's Entrepreneurship|last=Ahl|first=Helene|publisher=Copenhagen Business School Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=14|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wendell|first=Susan|year=1987|title=A (Qualified) Defense of Liberal Feminism|url=|journal=Hypatia|volume=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While activists have tried calling on [[Title VII]] to provide an equal hiring and promotional process, that practice has had limited success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abrams|first1=Kathryn|title=Gender Discrimination and the Transformation of Workplace Norms|journal=Vand. L. Rev|date=1989|volume=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proposed step towards solving the problem of the gender pay gap and the unequal work opportunities is the ratification of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] which would constitutionally guarantee [[equal rights for women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soule|first1=Sarah A.|last2=Olzak|first2=Susan|title=When do Movements Matter?

===Economic and social consequences===
If a woman ''does'' act according to female stereotypes, she is likely to receive backlash for not being competent enough; if she does ''not'' act according to the stereotypes connected to her gender and behaves more [[androgynous]], or even [[Masculinity|masculine]], it is likely to cause backlash through [[third-party punishment]] or further [[job discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rudman|first1=Laurie A.|last2=Glick|first2=Peter|title=Prescriptive Gender Stereotypes and Backlash Toward Agentic Women|journal=Journal of Social Issues|date=2001|volume=57|issue=4|doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00239|pages=743–762}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, women are expected to behave in a way that aligns with female gender stereotypes while these stereotypes are simultaneously used to justify their lack of success in an economic context, putting women in the workforce in a precarious, "double bind" situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Joan C.|title=Reconstructive Feminism: Changing the Way We Talk About Gender and Work Thirty Years After the PDA|journal=21 Yale J.L. &amp; Feminism|date=2009|volume=79|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proposed step to relieve women from this issue is the above-mentioned ratification of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], as it would legally further gender equality and prohibit gender-based discrimination&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Tarver|first2=Banks|date=1989|title=Equal Rights Amendment: Governmental Action and Individual Liberty|journal=Tex. L. Rev.|volume=68|last1=Kilgarlin|first1=William Wayne}}&lt;/ref&gt; regardless if a woman is acting according to female gender stereotypes or in defiance of them.

[[Rosabeth Moss Kanter]] identified four types of stereotypes given to professional women via the media. The four stereotypes are, iron maiden, pet, mother, and [[Seduction|seductress]]/sex object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Men and Women of the Corporation|last=Kanter|first=Rosabeth Moss|publisher=Basic Books Inc.|year=1993|isbn=9780465044542|location=New York|pages=233–236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iron maiden refers to women who are deemed to display too many [[Masculinity|masculine]] traits and not enough feminine traits according to her audience. This leads audiences to question the trustworthiness of an iron maiden, because she is seen as strategically playing the field to appease voters. The pet stereotype is given to women who are identified as helpmates, cheerleaders, or mascots, which then leads the audience to see these women as naive or weak and unable to lead without a man's help. If a professional woman is seen as a mother, she is more likely to be seen as compassionate and caring, but also has the capacity to be shrew, punishing, and scolding. Additionally, it is possible for her leadership abilities to be called into question due to perceived conflicts with her maternal responsibilities. The fourth stereotype, [[Seduction|seductress]], is assigned to women who speak and act rather femininely, or have been victims of [[sexual harassment]]. The media tends to focus on the seductress woman's sex appeal and physical appearance in opposition to her policy stances and [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carlin|first=Diana B.|date=Fall 2009|title=Have You Come a Long Way, Baby? Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, and Sexism in 2008 Campaign Coverage|url=http://www.kean.edu/~jkeil/Welcome_files/Have%20You%20Come%20a%20Long%20Way%3F.pdf|journal=Communication Studies|volume=60.4|issue=4|pages=326–343|doi=10.1080/10510970903109904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposed step to relieve women from that [[double bind]] is the above-mentioned ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment as it would further legal gender equality and prohibit gender-based discrimination&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kilgarlin|first1=William Wayne|last2=Tarver|first2=Banks|title=Equal Rights Amendment: Governmental Action and Individual Liberty|journal=Tex. L. Rev.|date=1989|volume=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; regardless if a women is acting according to female gender stereotypes or in defiance of them.

===Implicit gender stereotypes===
{{See also|Implicit stereotype}}
[[File:Bettie Page driving.jpg|thumb|300px|A magazine feature from ''Beauty Parade'' from March 1952 stereotyping women drivers. It features [[Bettie Page]] as the model.]]
Gender stereotypes and roles can also be supported implicitly. [[Implicit stereotypes]] are the unconscious influence of attitudes a person may or may not be aware that they hold. A person is influenced by these attitudes even though they are not aware. Gender stereotypes can also be held in this manner.

These implicit stereotypes can often be demonstrated by the [[Implicit-association test]] (IAT).

One example of an implicit gender stereotype is that males are seen as better at mathematics than females. It has been found that men have stronger positive associations with mathematics than women, while women have stronger negative associations with mathematics and the more strongly a woman associated herself with the female gender identity, the more negative her association with mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nosek | first1 = Brian A. | last2 = Banaji | first2 = Mahzarin R. | last3 = Greenwald | first3 = Anthony G. | title = Math = male, me = female, therefore math ≠ me | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 83 | issue = 1 | pages = 44–59 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] via [[PsycINFO|PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.83.1.44 | date = July 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.83.1.44 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These associations have been disputed for their biological connection to gender and have been attributed to social forces that perpetuate stereotypes such as aforementioned stereotype that men are better at mathematics than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=kYw7ZZzCqNYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=males+better+at+math&amp;ots=HXpUZBXjRr&amp;sig=GWSjZblPorVMGotmF9AwqVyJjDw#v=onepage&amp;q=males+better+at+math&amp;f=false|title=Myths Of Gender: Biological Theories About Women And Men, Revised Edition|first=Anne|last=Fausto-Sterling|date=4 August 2008|publisher=Basic Books|accessdate=22 October 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This particular stereotype has been found in American children in as early as second grade.&lt;ref name="Cvencek" /&gt;

The same test with Singaporean children found that the strength of their mathematics-gender stereotype and their gender identity predicted the association between individuals and mathematical ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cvencek | first1 = Dario | last2 = Meltzoff | first2 = Andrew N. | last3 = Kapur | first3 = Manu | title = Cognitive consistency and math–gender stereotypes in Singaporean children | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 117 | pages = 73–91 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.jecp.2013.07.018 | pmid = 24141205 | date = January 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2013.07.018 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that this stereotype also reflects mathematical performance: a study was done on the worldwide scale and it was found that the strength of this mathematics-gender stereotype in varying countries correlates with 8th graders' scores on the [[TIMSS]], a standardized math and science achievement test that is given worldwide. The results were controlled for general gender inequality and yet were still significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nosek | first1 = B. A. | last2 = Smyth | first2 = F.

==Gender inequality online==
An example of gender stereotypes assumes those of the male gender are more 'tech savvy' and happier working online, however, a study done by Hargittai &amp; Shafer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Differences in Actual and Perceived Online Skills: The Role of Gender*|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6237.2006.00389.x/abstract|journal = Social Science Quarterly |date=1 June 2006 |issn = 1540-6237|pages = 432–448|volume = 87|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2006.00389.x|first = Eszter|last = Hargittai|first2 = Steven|last2 = Shafer}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that many women also typically have lower self-perceived abilities when it comes to use of the World Wide Web and online navigation skills. Because this stereotype is so well known many women assume they lack such technical skills when in reality, the gap in technological skill level between men and women is significantly less than many women assume.

In the journal article written by Elizabeth Behm-Morawitz video games have been guilty of using sexualised female characters, who wear revealing clothing with an 'ideal' figure. It has been shown, female gamers can experience lower self-efficacy when playing a game with a sexualized female character. Females have been stereotyped in online games and have shown to be quiet sexist in their appearance. It has been shown these kind of character appearances have influenced peoples' beliefs about gender capabilities by assigning certain qualities to the make and female characters in different games. &lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-009-9683-8&lt;/ref&gt;   

The concept of gender inequality is often perceived as something that is non-existent within the online community, because of the anonymity possible online. Remote or home-working greatly reduces the volume of information one individual gives another compared to face-to-face encounters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Postmes|first1=Tom|last2=Spears|first2=Russell|title=Behavior Online: Does Anonymous Computer Communication Reduce Gender Inequality?|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=2002|volume=28|issue=8|pages=1073–1083|doi=10.1177/01461672022811006}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing fewer opportunities for unequal treatment but it seems real-world notions of power and privilege are being duplicated: people who choose to take up different identities (avatars) in the online world are (still) routinely discriminated against, evident in [[Online game|online gaming]] where users are able to create their own characters. This freedom allows the user to create characters and identities with a different appearance than their own in reality, essentially allowing them to create a new identity, confirming regardless of actual gender those who are perceived to be female are treated differently because of their on-line gender identity.

In marked contrast to the traditional male-dominated stereotype a study shows that 52% of the gaming audience is made up of women and a minority of gaming characters are women. Only 12% of game designers in Britain and 3% of all programmers are women.&lt;ref name="Jayanth1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = 52% of gamers are women – but the industry doesn’t know it {{!}} Meg Jayanth|url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/18/52-percent-people-playing-games-women-industry-doesnt-know|website = the Guardian|accessdate =10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the growing number of females who partake in online communities, and the anonymous space provided by the Internet issues such of gender inequality, the issue has simply been transplanted into the online world.

== Politics and gender issues ==
=== In political office ===
{{Undue weight|section|date=December 2016}}
Even though the number of women running for [[elected office]] has increased over the last decades, they still only make up 20% of U.S. senators, 19.4% of U.S. congressional representatives and 24% of statewide executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Current Numbers |quote=This page contains current numbers of women officeholders serving in 2017 with links on the right to basic fact sheets for each level of office. |url=http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/current-numbers|website=www.cawp.rutgers.edu/current-numbers|publisher=Center for American Women and Politics|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many of these political campaigns appear to focus on the aggressiveness of the female candidate which is often still perceived as a masculine trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huddy|first1=Leonie|last2=Terkildsen|first2=Nayda|title=Gender Stereotyoes and the Perception of Male and Female Candidates|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=February 1993|volume=37|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, female candidates are running based on gender-opposing stereotypes because that predicts higher likelihood of success than appearing to be a stereotypical woman.

Elections of increasing numbers of women into office serves as a basis for many scholars to claim that voters are not biased towards a candidate's gender. However, it has been shown that female politicians are perceived as only being superior when it comes to handling [[women's rights]] and [[poverty]], whereas male politicians are perceived to be better at dealing with [[crime]] and [[foreign affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanbonmatsu|first1=Kira|title=Stereotypes and Vote Choice|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=January 2002|volume=46|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; That view lines up with the most common gender stereotypes.

It has also been predicted that gender does only highly matter for female candidates that have not been politically established. These predictions apply further to established candidates, stating that gender would not be a defining factor for their campaign or the focal point of media coverage. This has been disproven by multiple scholars, often based on [[Hillary Clinton]]'s multiple campaigns for the office of [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carroll|first=Susan J.|year=2009|title=Reflections on Gender and Hillary Clinton's Presidential Campaign: The Good, the Bad, and the Misogynic|url=|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=5|pages=1–20|via=|doi=10.1017/s1743923x09000014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carlin|first1=Diana B.|last2=Winfrey|first2=Kelly L.|title=Have You Come A Long Way, Baby?

Additionally, when voters don't have a lot of information about a female candidate, they are likely to view her as being a stereotypical woman which they often take as a basis for not electing her because they consider typical male qualities as being crucial for someone holding a political office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huddy|first1=Leonie|last2=Terkildsen|first2=Nadya|title=The Consequences of Gender Stereotypes for Women Candidates at Different Levels and Types of Office|journal=Political Research Quarterly|date=1993|volume=46|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 20th century, women in the United States saw a dramatic shift in social and professional aspirations and norms. Following the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|Women’s Suffrage Movement]] of the late-nineteenth century, which resulted in the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] allowing women to vote, and in combination with conflicts in Europe, [[World War I|WWI]] and [[World War II|WWII]], women found themselves shifted into the industrial workforce. During this time, women were expected to take up industrial jobs and support the troops abroad through the means of domestic industry. Moving from "homemakers" and "caregivers", women were now factory workers and "breadwinners" for the family.

However, after the war, men returned home to the United States and women, again, saw a shift in social and professional dynamics. With the reuniting of the nuclear family, the ideals of American [[Suburb]]ia boomed. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, [[middle-class]] families moved in droves from urban living into newly developed single-family homes on former farmland just outside major cities. Thus established what many modern critics describe as the "private sphere".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rotman | first1 = Deborah L. | year = 2006 | title = Separate Spheres? Beyond the Dichotomies of Domesticity | url = | journal = Current Anthology | volume = 47 | issue =4 | pages=666–674 |doi=10.1086/506286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though frequently sold and idealized as “perfect living”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dodson | first1 = Dan W. | year = 1958 | title = Suburbanism and Education | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Sociology | volume = 32 | issue = 1| pages =2–7|doi=10.2307/2264228| jstor = 2264228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; many women had difficulty adjusting to the new “private sphere.” Writer [[Betty Friedan]] described this discontent as “[[The Feminine Mystique|the feminine mystique]].” The “mystique” was derived from women equipped with the knowledge, skills, and aspirations of the workforce, the “public sphere”, who felt compelled whether socially or morally to devote themselves to the home and family.&lt;ref&gt;Friedan, Betty.

Another recent article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' indicates that young women today are closing the pay gap. Luisita Lopez Torregrosa has noted, "Women are ahead of men in education (last year, 55 percent of U.S. college graduates were female). And a study shows that in most U.S. cities, single, childless women under 30 are making an average of 8 percent more money than their male counterparts, with Atlanta and Miami in the lead at 20 percent.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Torregrosa|first=Luisita|title=They Call It the Reverse Gender Gap|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/14/us/14iht-letter14.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=30 November 2012|date=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this study concerned American cities, a global trend is developing, and has now been termed "the reverse gender gap."

Feminist theory generally defines gender as a social construct that includes ideologies governing feminine/masculine (female/male) appearances, actions, and behaviors. An example of these gender roles would be that males were supposed to be the educated breadwinners of the family, and occupiers of the public sphere whereas, the female’s duty was to be a homemaker, take care of her husband and children, and occupy the private sphere. According to contemporary gender role ideology, gender roles are continuously changing. This can be seen in [[Londa Schiebinger]]'s ''Has Feminism Changed Science'' in which she states that, "Gendered characteristics - typically masculine or feminine behaviors, interests, or values-are not innate, nor are they arbitrary. They are formed by historical circumstances. They can also change with historical circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;''Has Feminism Changed Science?'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-674-00544-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of the contemporary definition of gender was depicted in [[Sally Shuttleworth]]’s ''Female Circulation'' in which the, “abasement of the woman, reducing her from an active participant in the labor market to the passive bodily existence to be controlled by male expertise is indicative of the ways in which the ideological deployment of gender roles operated to facilitate and sustain the changing structure of familial and market relations in Victorian England.”&lt;ref&gt;Shuttleworth, Sally. "Female Circulation: Medical Discourse and Popular Advertising in the Mid-Victorian Era." Body/Politics: Women and the Discourses of Science. Eds. Mary Jacobus, Evelyn Fox Keller and Sally Shuttleworth. New York: Routledge, 1990. 47–70&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, this shows what it meant to grow up into the roles (gender roles) of a female in Victorian England, which transitioned from being a homemaker to being a working woman and then back to being passive and inferior to males. In conclusion, gender roles in the contemporary sex gender model are socially constructed, always changing, and do not really exist since, they are ideologies that society constructs in order for various benefits at various times in history.

The men's rights movement (MRM) is a part of the larger [[men's movement]]. It branched off from the [[men's liberation movement]] in the early-1970s. The men's rights movement is made up of a variety of groups and individuals who are concerned about what they consider to be issues of male disadvantage, [[discrimination]] and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HgzFZ4o0qnMC&amp;pg=PA11 |page=11 |last=Gavanas |first=Anna |title=Fatherhood Politics in the United States: Masculinity, Sexuality, Race, and Marriage |publisher=University of Illinois Press |location= Urbana |year=2004 |isbn=0-252-02884-8 |quote=All these cases of perceived discrimination make up the men's rights view that men are considered, by government and society, to be more expendable than women.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BoydLongwood1996"&gt;{{cite book|title=Redeeming men: religion and masculinities|editors=Stephen Blake Boyd, W.

Sexual orientation is defined by the interplay between a person's emotional and physical attraction toward others.&lt;ref&gt;Issues in Society : Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity. (2014). Thirroul, AU: The Spinney Press. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ebrary.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, sexual orientation is broken into the three categories: heterosexual, homosexual and bisexual. By basic definition, the term heterosexual is typically used in reference to someone who is attracted to people of the opposite sex, the term homosexual is used to classify people who are attracted to those of the same sex, and the term bisexual is used to identify those who are attracted to both the same and opposite sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindley | first1 = Lisa | last2 = Walsemann | first2 = Katrina | last3 = Carter | first3 = Jarvis | year = 2012 | title = The Association of Sexual Orientation Measures With Young Adults' Health-Related Outcomes | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 102 | issue = 6| pages = 1177–1178 | doi = 10.2105/ajph.2011.300262 | pmid = 22021310 | pmc=3483939}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some argue that sexual orientation is better defined as a continuum with those three categories represented. This idea was first proposed by sexologist Alfred Kinsey in 1948. After conducting a series of interviews, Kinsey and his team of researchers concluded that most people fell somewhere on a spectrum between strictly heterosexual and strictly homosexual. Their findings suggested that sexual orientation was more fluid than once believed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Epstein | first1 = Robert | last2 = McKinney | first2 = Paul | last3 = Fox | first3 = Shannon | last4 = Garcia | first4 = Carlos | year = 2013 | title = Support for a Fluid-Continuum Model or Sexual Orientation: A Large-Scale Internet Study | url = | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 59 | issue = 10| pages = 1356–1358 | doi = 10.1080/00918369.2012.724634 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps it is an attempt to reconcile this conflict that leads to a common assumption that one same-sex partner assumes a pseudo-male gender role and the other assumes a pseudo-female role. For a gay male relationship, this might lead to the assumption that the "wife" handled domestic chores, was the receptive sexual partner, adopted effeminate mannerisms, and perhaps even dressed in women's clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mager|first1=Don|title=Gay Theories of Gender Role Deviance|journal=SubStance|date=1985|volume=14|issue=1|pages=32–48|doi=10.2307/3684953|jstor=3684953}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assumption is flawed because homosexual couples tend to have more equal roles, and the effeminate behavior of some gay men is usually not adopted consciously, and is often more subtle.&lt;ref name=Dwyer&gt;{{cite book|last=Dwyer |first=D.|title=Interpersonal Relationships [e-book]|year=2000|publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-203-01971-7|page=104|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cultures, gender roles, especially for men, simultaneously act as an indicator for heterosexuality, and as a boundary of acceptable behavior for straight people. In some cases, cultures where homosexuality is illegal and/or [[taboo]], gender roles act as indicators of sexuality and boundaries of acceptable behavior. Therefore, lesbians, gay men and bisexual people may be viewed as exempt from some or all components of gender roles, or as having different "rules" they are expected to follow by society.

These modified "rules" for lesbian, gay and bisexual people may also be oppressive. Morgan examines the plight of homosexuals seeking [[right of asylum|asylum]] from homophobic persecution who have been turned away by US customs for "not being gay enough"; not conforming sufficiently to standard (Western) conceptions of the gender roles occupied by gays and lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, D. (2006) Not gay enough for the government: Racial and sexual stereotypes in sexual orientation asylum cases. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Legal Issues http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/lsex15&amp;div=9&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals#141&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, heterosexual men and women who are not perceived as being sufficiently masculine or feminine, respectively, may be assumed to be, or suspected to be, homosexual, and persecuted for their perceived homosexuality.

==Criminal justice==
{{Main article|Gender and crime}}
A number of studies conducted since the mid-90s have found direct correlation between a female criminal’s ability to conform to gender role [[stereotypes]], particularly murder committed in self-defense, and the severity of their sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, W. (2001). Women, Murder and Justice. Hampshire: Palgrave.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hart, L. (1994). Fatal Women: Lesbian Sexuality and the Mark of Aggression.

Like Andersen and Hill Collins (1998: 4) in their discussion of what they refer to as a 'matrix of domination,' we too conceive that class, race, and gender represent "multiple, interlocking levels of domination that stem from the societal configurations of these structural relationships. These patterned actions, in turn, affect [ing] individual consciousness, group interaction, and individual and group access to institutional power and privileges.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barak|first=Gregg|title=Class, Race, and Gender in Criminology and Criminal Justice: Ways of Seeing Difference|url=http://critcrim.org/critpapers/barak.htm|publisher=American Society of Criminology|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Patterns of offending by men and by women are notable both for their similarities and for their differences. Both men and women are more heavily involved in minor property and substance abuse offenses than in serious crimes like robbery or murder. However, men offend at much higher rates than women for all crime categories except prostitution. This gender gap in crime is greatest for serious crime and least for mild forms of lawbreaking such as minor property crimes." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steffensmeier|first=Darrell|author2=Emilie Allan|title=Gender and Crime: Toward a Gendered Theory of Female Offending|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|year=1996|volume=22|pages=459–487|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.22.1.459|issue=1}}&lt;!--|accessdate=22 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender roles in family violence===
The ‘Family Violence Framework’ applies gender dynamics to family violence.&lt;ref name="Hattery2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hattery|first1=Angela|last2=Smith|first2=Earl|title=The Social Dynamics of Family Violence|date=2012|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=9780813344638|page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RX0fAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA7|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Straus, M &amp; Gelles, R (1995) Physical violence in American families. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction.&lt;/ref&gt; “Families are constructed around relationships that involve obligations and responsibilities, but also status and power”.&lt;ref name="Hattery2012"/&gt; According to Hattery and Smith, when “masculinity and femininity are constructed…to generate these rigid and narrow gender roles, it contributes to a culture of violence against women”&lt;ref name="Hattery2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hattery|first1=Angela|last2=Smith|first2=Earl|title=The Social Dynamics of Family Violence|date=2016|publisher=Westview Press|location=Boulder|isbn=9780813349992|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; “People with more resources are more likely to be abusive towards those without resources”, meaning that the stronger member of the relationship abuses their weaker partner or family member to exert their powerful roles.&lt;ref name="Hattery2012"/&gt; However, the fight for power and equality remains – “Intimate partner violence in same-sex couples reveals that the rates are similar to those in the heterosexual community”.{{sfn|Hattery|Smith|2012|p=291}}
