[[Image:Bagpipe performer.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[bagpipes|bagpiper]] in [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[military]] clan-[[uniform]]. In many parts of the [[Western world]], wearing a [[skirt]] may be unacceptable as part of a male [[gender]] role; but in [[Scotland]], the [[kilt]] (a kind of skirt) is integral to traditional masculinity]]

A '''gender role''' is a theoretical construct in the [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]] that refers to a set of social and behavioral [[norm (sociology)|norms]] that, within a specific culture, are widely considered to be socially appropriate for individuals of a specific [[gender]].  Proponents of gender role theory assert that observed gender differences in behavior and personality characteristics are, at least in part, [[socially constructed]], and therefore, the product of socialization experiences; this contrasts with other models of gender that assert that gender differences are "essential" to biological sex.  Research supports this theory, finding gender differences in almost all societies, but with differences in the norms adopted, suggesting that gender differences are, at least partly, influenced by culture.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Gender has several controversial definitions but it here refers to an individual's inner sex or psychological sense of being a male or female irrespective of one's (outer) sex identity as determined by one's sexual organs. There are two main genders: [[masculine]] (male), or [[feminine]] (female). [[Gender identity]] refers to the options available to members of a society to choose from a set of social identities, based on the combination of one's [[sex identity]] on the one hand, and one's natural gender, interests and social experiences on the other. Some ancient tribes have more than five human genders. Some non-Western societies have three human genders – [[man]], [[woman]] and [[third gender]]. Gender roles refers to the set of attitudes and behaviors socially expected from the members of a particular gender identity. Gender roles are socially constructed which are often politicised and manipulated, which then result in the oppression of people.

In the modern West, this essential requirement has been changed to a heterosexual desire, resulting in the Western concepts of 'homosexual' and 'heterosexual,' instead of the usual gender identities for males. Researchers recognize that the concrete behavior of individuals is a consequence of both socially enforced rules and values, and individual disposition, whether genetic, unconscious, or conscious. Some researchers emphasize the objective social system and others emphasize subjective orientations and dispositions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Creativity may cause the rules and values to change over time. Cultures and societies are dynamic and ever-changing, but there has been extensive debate as to how, and how fast, they may change. Such debates are especially contentious when they involve the gender/sex system, as people have widely differing views about how much gender depends on biological sex.

== Talcott Parsons' view of gender roles ==
Working in the [[United States]], [[Talcott Parsons]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arte-tv.com Franco-German TV Station ARTE], Karambolage, August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; developed a model of the [[nuclear family]] in 1955. (At that place and time, the nuclear family was the prevalent family structure.) It compared a strictly traditional view of gender roles (from an industrial-age American perspective) to a more liberal view.

The Parsons model was used to contrast and illustrate extreme positions on gender roles. Model A describes total separation of male and female roles, while Model B describes the complete dissolution between gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;Brockhaus: Enzyklopädie der Psychologie, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; (The examples are based on the context of the culture and [[infrastructure]] of the United States.)

|}

However, these extreme positions are rarely found in reality; actual behavior of individuals is usually somewhere between these poles. The most common 'model' followed in real life in the United States and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] is the 'model of [[double burden]]' (See [[#Gender roles and feminism|Gender roles and feminism]] below).{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

According to the interactionist approach, roles (including gender roles) are not fixed, but are constantly negotiated between individuals. In North America and southern South America, this is the most common approach among families whose business is [[agriculture]].

Gender roles can influence all kinds of behaviors, such as choice of clothing, choice of work and personal relationships, e.g., parental status (See also [[Sociology of fatherhood]]).

== Gender roles and socialization ==
[[File:Roundhouse wipers.jpg|thumb|[[Roundhouse]] [[wiper (occupation)|wipers]] at lunch,  [[Chicago &amp; North Western Railroad]], 1943. Women took on men's jobs during [[World War II]] in the USA and elsewhere.]]

The process through which the individual learns and accepts roles is called [[socialization]]. Socialization works by encouraging wanted and discouraging unwanted behavior. These sanctions by [[socialization#Agents of Socialization|agents of socialization]] such as the family, schools, and the media make it clear to the child what is expected of the child by society. Mostly, accepted behavior is not produced by outright reforming coercion from an accepted [[social system]]. In some other cases, various forms of coercion have been used to acquire a desired response or function.

=== Gender roles with homogenization vs. ethnoconvergence difference ===

It is claimed that even in monolingual, industrial societies like urban North America, some individuals do cling to a "modernized" primordial identity, apart from others and with this a more diverse gender role is recognized or developed. Some intellectuals, such as [[Michael Ignatieff]], argue that convergence of a general culture does not directly entail a similar convergence in ethnic, social and self identities. This can become evident in social situations, where people divide into separate groups by gender roles and cultural alignments, despite being of an identical "super-ethnicity", such as [[nationality]].

[[Image:LouisXVchild.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Changing norms of socialization: [[Louis XV]] in 1712, wearing the customary clothes of [[breeching (boys)|unbreeched]] boys, would be considered "[[Cross-dressing|cross-dressed]]" in the 21st century.]]

Within each smaller ethnicity, individuals may tend to see it perfectly justified to assimilate with other cultures including sexuality and some others view assimilation as wrong and incorrect for their culture or institution. This common theme, representing dualist opinions of ethnoconvergence itself, within a single ethnic or common [[value (personal and cultural)|value]]s groups is often manifested in issues of sexual partners and [[matrimony]], employment preferences, etc. These varied opinions of ethnoconvergence represent themselves in a spectrum; [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]], [[wikt:homogeneous|homogenization]], [[acculturation]], gender identities and cultural compromise are commonly used terms for ethnoconvergence which flavor the issues to a bias.

Often it is in a secular, multi-ethnic environment that cultural concerns are both minimalized and exacerbated; Ethnic prides are boasted, hierarchy is created ("center" culture versus "periphery") but on the other hand, they will still share a common "culture", and common language and behaviors. Often the elderly, more conservative-in-association of a clan, tend to reject cross-cultural associations, and participate in ethnically similar community-oriented activities.

== Anthropology and evolution ==
The idea that differences in gender roles originate in differences in biology has found support in parts of the scientific community. 19th-century [[anthropology]] sometimes used descriptions of the imagined life of [[paleolithic]] [[hunter-gatherer]] societies for evolutionary explanations for gender differences. For example, those accounts maintain that the need to take care of offspring may have limited the females' freedom to hunt and assume positions of power.

More recently, [[sociobiology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]] have explained those differences in social roles by treating them as [[adaptation]]s. This approach, too, is considered controversial.

Due to the influence of (among others) [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s feminist works and [[Michel Foucault]]'s reflections on sexuality, the idea that [[gender]] was unrelated to sex gained ground during the 1980s, especially in sociology and cultural anthropology. This view claims that a person could therefore be born with male genitals but still be of feminine gender. In 1987, [[R.W. Connell]] did extensive research on whether there are any connections between biology and gender role&lt;ref&gt;Connell, Robert William: Gender and Power, Cambridge: University Press 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; and concluded that there were none. Most scientists reject Connell's research because concrete evidence exists proving the effect of hormones on behavior.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} However, hormone levels vary, and disorders can cause an intersex status. The debate continues to rage on. [[Simon Baron-Cohen]], a Cambridge Univ. professor of psychology and psychiatry, claims that "the female brain is predominantly hard-wired for empathy, while the male brain is predominantly hard-wired for understanding and building systems."

[[Sandra Bem|Dr. Sandra Lipsitz Bem]] is a psychologist who developed the gender schema theory to explain how individuals come to use gender as an organizing category in all aspects of their life.  It is based on the combination of aspects of the [[social cognitive theory|social learning theory]] and the [[theory of cognitive development|cognitive-development theory]] of sex role acquisition.  In 1971, she created the Bem Sex Role Inventory to measure how well you fit into your traditional gender role by characterizing your personality as masculine, feminine, androgynous, or undifferentiated.  She believed that through gender-schematic processing, a person spontaneously sorts attributes and behaviors into masculine and feminine categories.  Therefore, an individual processes information and regulate their behavior based on whatever definitions of [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]] their culture provides.&lt;ref&gt;Bem,S.L.(1981). Gender schema theory:A cognitive account of sex typing. ''Psychological Review'',88,354–364&lt;/ref&gt;

The current trend in Western societies toward men and women sharing similar occupations, responsibilities and jobs suggests that the sex one is born with does not directly determine one's abilities{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}. While there are differences in average capabilities of various kinds (E.g. physical strength) between the sexes{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}, the capabilities of some members of one sex will fall within the range of capabilities needed for tasks conventionally assigned to the other sex.

In addition, research at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center has also shown that gender roles may be biological among primates. Yerkes researchers studied the interactions of 11 male and 23 female [[Rhesus monkey]]s with human toys, both wheeled and plush. The males played mostly with the wheeled toys while the females played with both types equally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yerkes.emory.edu/index/yerkes-app/story.90/title.yerkes-researchers-find-sex-differences-in-monkey-toy-preferences-similar-to-humans Yerkes Researchers Find Sex Differences in Monkey Toy Preferences Similar to Humans]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist Kim Wallen has, however, warned against overinterpeting the results as the color and size of the toys may also be factors in the monkey's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13596-male-monkeys-prefer-boys-toys.html |title=Male monkeys prefer boys' toys |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2008.03.008 |publisher=Newscientist.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Changing roles ==
A person's gender role is composed of several elements and can be expressed through clothing, behaviour, choice of work, personal relationships and other factors. These elements are not concrete and have evolved through time (for example women's trousers).

Traditionally only feminine and masculine gender roles existed, however, over time many different acceptable male or female gender roles have emerged.
An individual can either identify themselves with a subculture or social group which results in them having diverse gender roles. Historically, for example, [[eunuchs]] had a different gender role because their biology was changed.

[[Image:AssemblyOfQuakers.jpg|thumb|left|A woman publicly witnessing at a [[Quaker]] meeting seemed an extraordinary feature of the Religious Society of Friends, worth recording for a wider public. Engraving by Bernard Picart, ''ca'' 1723.]]

[[Androgyny]], a term denoting the display of both male and female behaviour, also exists. Many terms have been developed to portray sets of behaviors arising in this context. The masculine gender role in the West has become more malleable since the 1950s. One example is the "sensitive new age guy", which could be described as a traditional male gender role with a more typically "female" empathy and associated emotional responses. Another is the [[metrosexual]], a male who adopts or claims to be born with similarly "female" grooming habits. Some have argued that such new roles are merely rebelling against tradition more so than forming a distinct role. However, traditions regarding male and female appearance have never been concrete, and men in other eras have been equally interested with their appearance. The popular conceptualization of homosexual men, which has become more accepted in recent decades, has traditionally been more androgynous or effeminate, though in actuality homosexual men can also be masculine and even exhibit machismo characteristics. One could argue that since many homosexual men and women fall into one gender role or another or are androgynous, that gender roles are not strictly determined by a person's physical sex. Whether or not this phenomenon is due to social or biological reasons is debated. Many homosexual people find the traditional gender roles to be very restrictive, especially during childhood. Also, the phenomenon of [[intersex]] people, which has become more publicly accepted, has caused much debate on the subject of gender roles. Many intersexual people identify with the opposite sex, while others are more androgynous. Some see this as a threat to traditional gender roles, while others see it as a sign that these roles are a social construct, and that a change in gender roles will be liberating.

According to sociology research, traditional feminine gender roles have become less relevant and hollower in Western societies since industrialization started{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. For example, the cliché that women do not follow a career is obsolete in many Western societies. On the other hand, the media sometimes portrays women who adopt an extremely classical role as a subculture.  Women take on many roles that were traditionally reserved for men, as well as behaviors and fashions, which may cause pressure on many men to be more masculine and thus confined within an even smaller gender role, while other men react against this pressure. For example, men's fashions have become more restrictive than in other eras, while women's fashions have become more broad.
One consequence of social unrest during the Vietnam War era was that men began to let their hair grow to a length that had previously (within recent history) been considered appropriate only for women. Somewhat earlier, women had begun to cut their hair to lengths previously considered appropriate only to men.

Some famous people known for their androgynous appearances in the 20th century include [[Brett Anderson]], [[Gladys Bentley]], [[David Bowie]], [[Pete Burns]], [[Boy George]], [[Norman Iceberg]], [[k.d. lang]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[Jaye Davidson]], [[Marilyn Manson (musician)|Marilyn Manson]], [[Freddie Mercury]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Mylène Farmer]], [[Gackt]], [[Mana (musician)]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Marc Bolan]], [[Brian Molko]], [[Julia Sweeney]] (as [[Pat (fictional character)|Pat]]), [[Genesis P-Orridge]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Kristen McMenamy]].

== Culture and gender roles ==
[[Image:WomanFactory1940s.jpg|thumb|left|During [[World War II]], women filled job positions some of which would otherwise be male dominated.]]
Ideas of appropriate behavior according to gender vary among cultures and era, although some aspects receive more widespread attention than others. [[R.W. Connell]] in ''Men, Masculinities and Feminism'' claims:

:"There are cultures where it has been normal, not exceptional, for men to have homosexual relations. There have been periods in 'Western' history when the modern convention that men suppress displays of emotion did not apply at all, when men were demonstrative about their feeling for their friends. Mateship in the Australian outback last century is a case in point."

Other aspects, however, may differ markedly with time and place. In pre-industrial [[Europe]], for example, the practice of medicine (other than midwifery) was generally seen as a male prerogative. However, in [[Russia]], health care was more often seen as a feminine role. The results of these views can still be seen in modern society, where European medicine is most often practiced by men, while the majority of Russian doctors are women.

In many other cases, the elements of convention or tradition seem to play a dominant role in deciding which occupations fit in with which gender roles. In the United States, physicians have traditionally been men, and the few people who defied that expectation received a special job description: "woman doctor". Similarly, there were special terms like "male nurse", "woman lawyer", "lady barber", "male secretary," etc. But in the former Soviet Union countries, medical doctors are predominantly women, and in Germany and Taiwan it is very common for all of the barbers in a barber shop to be women. Also, throughout history, some jobs that have been typically male or female have switched genders. For example, clerical jobs used to be considered a men's jobs, but when several women began filling men's job positions due to World War II, clerical jobs quickly became dominated by women. It became more feminized, and women workers became known as "typewriters" or "secretaries". There are many other jobs that have switched gender roles. Many jobs are continually evolving as far as being dominated by women or men.

In Western society, people whose gender appears masculine are sometimes ridiculed for exhibiting what the society regards as a woman's gender role{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. For instance, someone with a masculine voice, a five o'clock shadow (or a fuller beard), an [[Adam's apple]], etc., wearing a woman's dress and high heels, carrying a purse, etc., would most likely draw ridicule or other unfriendly attention in ordinary social contexts (the stage and screen excepted&lt;ref name="Top Grossing Cross Dressing / Gender Bending Movies at the Box Office"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=crossdressing.htm|title=Cross Dressing / Gender Bending Movies|accessdate=2006-11-08|publisher=Box Office Mojo, LLC|year=1998|author=Box Office Mojo, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;). It is seen by some in that society that such a gender role for a man is not acceptable.&lt;ref name="How do transgender people suffer from discrimination?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/Content/NavigationMenu/HRC/Get_Informed/Issues/Transgender_Issues1/Transgender_Basics/Transgender_Basics.htm|title=Transgender Basics|accessdate=2006-11-08|publisher=The Human Rights Campaign|year=2004|author=The Human Rights Campaign|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061109011840/http%3A//www.hrc.org/Content/NavigationMenu/HRC/Get_Informed/Issues/Transgender_Issues1/Transgender_Basics/Transgender_Basics.htm |archivedate = November 9, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, and other societies, impose expectations on the behaviour of the members of society, and specifically on the gender roles of individuals, resulting in [[prescriptions regarding gender roles]].

== Transgenderism ==
{{Main|Transgender}}
As long as a person's perceived physiological sex is consistent with that person's [[gender identity]], the gender role of a person is so much a matter of course in a stable society that people rarely even think of it. Only in cases where, for whatever reason, an individual has a gender role that is inconsistent with his or her sex will the matter draw attention.  There are cases wherein the external [[genitalia]] of a person, that person's perceived gender identity, and/or that person's gender role are not consistent.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  Some people mix gender roles to form a personally comfortable androgynous combination or violate the scheme of gender roles completely, regardless of their physiological sex.  People who are [[transsexual]] are born and assigned one sex, are brought up in the corresponding gender, but have a gender identity of the ''opposite sex'' and seek to live in that gender and perform that gender role.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

== Gender roles and feminism ==
{{Main|Feminism}}

For approximately the last 100 years women have been fighting for the same rights as men (especially around the turn from 19th to 20th century with the struggle for [[women's suffrage]] and in the 1960s with [[second-wave feminism]] and [[radical feminism]]) and were able to make changes to the traditionally accepted feminine gender role. However, most feminists today say there is still work to be done.

Numerous studies and statistics show that even though the situation for women has improved during the last century, [[discrimination]] is still widespread: women earn an average of 77 cents to every one dollar men earn ("[[The Shriver Report]]", 2009), occupy lower-ranking job positions than men, and do most of the housekeeping work.&lt;ref name="Gender differences in perceptions of household labor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-18658547.html|title=Gender differences in perceptions of household labor|accessdate=2009-10-23|publisher=The Journal of Psychology|date=July 1, 1996|author=Kiger, Kiger; Riley, Pamela J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several reasons for the wage disparity.  Studies have indicated that many jobs that were traditionally perceived as "masculine" usually have longer hours, necessitate long periods of exposure to the elements, are higher risk, and require a fair amount of physical strength {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}.

A recent (October 2009) report from the Center for American Progress, "The Shriver Report: A Woman's Nation Changes Everything" tells us that women now make up 48% of the US workforce and "mothers are breadwinners or co-breadwinners in a majority of families" (63.3%, see figure 2, page 19 of the Executive Summary of The Shriver Report).&lt;ref name="The Shriver Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/10/womans_nation.html/#executive_summary|title=The Shriver Report: A Woman's Nation Changes Everything|accessdate=2009-10-23|publisher=Center for American Progress|date=October 19, 2009|author=Maria Shriver and the Center for American Progress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' indicated that gender roles are still prevalent in many upscale restaurants. A restaurant's decor and menu typically play into which gender frequents which restaurant. Whereas [[Cru]], a restaurant in [[New York]]'s, [[Greenwich Village]], "decorated in clubby brown tones and distinguished by a wine list that lets high rollers rack up breathtaking bills," attracts more men than women, places like [[Mario Batali]]'s, Otto, serves more women than men, as a result that the restaurant has been "designed to be more approachable, with less swagger." Servers of both men and women at the same table still often go with the assumption that the male is the go-to person, as far as who receives the check and makes the wine decisions, but this appears to be a trend that is being used with more caution, especially with groups of younger people. Restaurants that used to cater to more men or women are now also trying to change their decor in the hopes of attracting broader equity.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times''."Old Gender Roles With Your Dinner?" Oct. 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
Note that many people consider some or all of the following terms to have negative [[connotation]]s.
* A male adopting (or who is perceived as adopting) a female gender role might be described as [[effeminate]], ''[[fop]]pish'', or [[sissy]]. Even more [[pejorative]] terms include ''mollycoddled'', ''milksop'', ''sop'', ''mamma's boy'', ''namby-pamby,'' and ''nancy boy''.
* A female adopting (or who is perceived as adopting) a male role might be described as [[butch and femme|butch]], a [[dyke (slang)|dyke]], a [[tomboy]], or as an ''amazon'' (See [[amazon feminism]]). More pejorative terms include ''battleaxe''.

== Sexual orientation and gender roles ==
{{Ref improve section|date=November 2010}}
{{Wikinews|RuPaul speaks about society and the state of drag as performance art}}

Traditional gender roles include male attraction to females, and vice versa. [[Gay]], [[lesbian]] and [[bisexuality|bisexual]] people, among others, usually don't conform to these expectations. An active conflict over the cultural acceptability of non-[[heterosexuality]] rages worldwide. (See [[Societal attitudes towards homosexuality]].) The belief or assumption that [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] relationships and acts are "normal" is described — largely by the opponents of this viewpoint — as [[heterosexism]] or in [[queer theory]], [[heteronormativity]].

Perhaps it is an attempt to reconcile this conflict that leads to a common assumption that one same-sex partner assumes a pseudo-male gender role and the other assumes a pseudo-female role. For a gay male relationship, this might lead to the assumption that the "wife" handled domestic chores, was the receptive sexual partner during sex, adopted effeminate mannerisms, and perhaps even dressed in women's clothing. This assumption is flawed, as many homosexual couples tend to have more equal roles, and the effeminate behavior of some gay men is usually not adopted consciously, and is often more subtle.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Feminine or masculine behaviors in some homosexual people might be a product of the socialization process, adopted unconsciously due to stronger identification with the opposite sex during development. The role of both this process and the role of biology is debated.

The existence of these separate identities (dominant masculine vs. more passive feminine), where present, can establish the dynamics of the relationship, according to the heterosexual patterns; this is not always the case, especially in relationships with less clearly defined sexual/identity roles. A related assumption is that all [[androphilia|androphilic]] people, including gay men, should or do adopt feminine mannerisms and other gender-role elements, and that all [[gynophilia|gynophilic]] people, including lesbians, should or do adopt masculine mannerisms and other gender-role elements; it is unclear how [[bisexuality]] fits into this framework, but it can be assumed they have a tendency towards both gender roles as they do in sexuality, towards both sexes. However, this idea is based on generalizations of homosexual people, which tend to be biased, as feminine gays and masculine lesbians are more widely visible than masculine gays or feminine lesbians.

Same-sex [[domestic partnership|domestic partners]] also challenge traditional gender roles because it is impossible to divide up household responsibilities if both partners attempt to fill the same gender role. Like all live-in couples, same-sex partners usually do come to some arrangement with regard to household responsibilities. Sometimes these arrangements do assign traditional female responsibilities to one partner and traditional male responsibilities to the other, but non-traditional divisions of labor are also quite common. For instance, cleaning and cooking, traditionally both female responsibilities, might be assigned to different people. Some people do adopt the sexual role of [[bottom (sex)|bottom]] or [[top (sex)|top]], due to their own sexual identity or for convenience; but this is not universal, and does not necessarily correspond to assignment of household responsibilities. Most of gay couples in real life are [[versatile (sex)|versatile]].

[[Cross-dressing]] is also quite common in gay and lesbian culture, but it is usually restricted to festive occasions, though there are people of all [[sexual orientation]]s who routinely engage in various types of cross-dressing, either as a fashion statement or for entertainment. Distinctive styles of dress, however, are commonly seen in gay and lesbian circles. These fashions sometimes emulate the traditional styles of the opposite gender (For example, lesbians who wear t-shirts and boots instead of skirts and dresses, or gay men who wear clothing with traditionally feminine elements, including displays of jewelry or coloration), but others do not. Fashion choices also do not necessarily align with other elements of gender identity. Some fashion and behavioral elements in gay and lesbian culture are novel, and do not really correspond to any traditional gender roles. For example, the popularity of rainbow jewelry, or the gay techno/dance music subculture. In addition to the stereotypically effeminate one, another significant gay male subculture is [[homomasculinity]], emphasizing certain traditionally masculine or hypermasculine traits. (See [[Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures]])

The term ''dyke'', commonly used to mean ''lesbian'', sometimes carries associations of a butch or masculine identity, and the variant ''bulldyke'' certainly does. Other gender-role-charged lesbian terms include [[lipstick lesbian]], [[Soft butch|chapstick lesbian]], and [[Stone Femme]]. "Butch," "femme," and novel elements are also seen in various lesbian subcultures.

External social pressures may lead some people to adopt a persona which is perceived as more appropriate for a heterosexual (For instance, in an intolerant work environment) or homosexual (for instance, in a same-sex dating environment), while maintaining a somewhat different identity in other, more private circumstances. The acceptance of new gender roles in [[Western world|Western societies]], however, is rising.&lt;ref&gt;According to John Money, in the case of androgen-induced transsexual status, "The clitoris becomes hypertrophied so as to become a penile clitoris with incomplete fusion and a urogenital sinus, or, if fusion is complete, a penis with urethra and an empty scrotum" (''Gay, Straight, and In-Between'', p. 31). At ovarian puberty, "menstruation through the penis" begins (op. cit., p. 32). In the case of the adrenogenital syndrome, hormonal treatment could bring about "breast growth and menstruation through the penis" (op. cit., p. 34). In one case an individual was born with a fully formed penis and empty scrotum. At the age of puberty that person's own physician provided treatment with cortisol. "His breasts developed and heralded the approach of first menstruation, through the penis".&lt;/ref&gt; However, during childhood and adolescence, gender identities which differ from the norm are often the cause of ridicule and ostracism, which often results in psychological problems. Some are able to disguise their differences, but others are not. Even though much of society has become more tolerant, gender roles are still very prevalent in the emotionally charged world of children and teenagers, which makes life very difficult for those who differ from the established norms.

=== The role of ideology in the enculturation of gender roles ===
{{Disputed|section|date=May 2008}}

High levels of agreement on the characteristics different cultures to males and females reflects consensus in gender role ideology. The [[Nordic countries]] are among the most egalitarian modern societies concerning gender roles, whereas the most traditional roles are found in Nigeria, Pakistan, and India.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Men and women cross-culturally rate the ideal self as more masculine than their self.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} The American difference on spatial reasoning between males and females does not apply in all cultures. One example of where it does not is the Inuit culture in Canada. Male superiority is found in tight, sedentary, agriculturally based cultures, while females are superior in cultures that are loose, nomadic, and hunter-gathering based. US females are more conforming to others than are males.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Males are more aggressive in all cultures for which data exists.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} This is related to, but not solely determined by, age and hormones though some researchers would suggest that women are not necessarily less aggressive than men but tend to show their aggression in more subtle and less overt ways (Bjorkqvist et al. 1994, Hines and Saudino 2003). Male aggression may be a "gender marking" issue breaking away from the instruction of the mother during adolescence.

== Gender roles and criminal justice==

A number of studies conducted since the mid-90s have found direct correlation between a female criminal’s ability to conform to gender role [[stereotypes]], particularly murder committed in self-defense, and the severity of their sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, W.

== Gender roles in prison ==
{{Disputed-section|date=March 2008}}
Gender roles in male prisons go further than the "[[Don't drop the soap]]"-joke. The truth is that some prisoners, either by choice or by force, take on strict 'female roles' according to prison set guidelines. For instance, a 'female' in prison is seen as timid, submissive, passive, and a means of sexual pleasure. When entering the prison environment some inmates "turn out" on their own free will, meaning they actively pursue the 'female role' in prison to gain some form of social power and/or prestige. Other, unlucky inmates, are forced to partake in 'female role' activities through coercion; the most common means being physical abuse. The inmates that are forced to "turn out" are commonly referred to as "punks". Other terms used to describe 'female' inmates are "girls", "kids", and "gumps". Some of the labels may be used as a means of describing one's [[ascribed status]]. For example, a "kid" is one that is usually dominated by their owner, or "daddy". The "daddy" is usually one with a high social status and prestige within the prison (E.g. gang leader). The "female" gender role is constructed through the mirror image of what the inmates perceive as a male. For instance, inmates view men as having strength, power, prestige, and an unyielding personality. However, the inmates don't refer to the female guards, who have power and prestige over the inmates, as males. The female guards are commonly referred to as "dykes", "ditch lickers", and lesbians. These roles are also assumed in female prisons.&lt;ref name="coggeshall"&gt;John M. Coggeshall: ''The Best of Anthropology Today: ‘Ladies’ Behind Bars: A Liminal Gender as Cultural Mirror''&lt;/ref&gt;

Women who enter prison society often ''voluntarily'' enter into lesbianism, as a means of protection from ''gangs'' or stronger females. In doing so, they will take on the [[submissive]] role to a dominant female in exchange for that dominating female keeping them safe. Those who do not enter voluntarily into lesbianism might at one time or another be group raped, to introduce them into that circle, and sometimes they will be referred to as ''sheep'', meaning anyone can have them. It is to avoid that status that most female inmates ''choose'' a mate, or allow themselves to be ''chosen'' as a mate, which can make them available to only a minimal number of partners during their incarceration, as opposed to a large number. So, in a sense, an inmate undergoes a "female role" in the prison system either by choice or by yielding to excessive coercion, and it is that yielding that terms the once male inmates as "females", and which identifies the stronger females in a female prison system as "males".&lt;ref name="coggeshall" /&gt;
