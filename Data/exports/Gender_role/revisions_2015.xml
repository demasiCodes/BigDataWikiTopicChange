A '''gender role''' is a set of societal [[norm (social)|norms]] dictating what types of behaviors are generally considered acceptable, appropriate or desirable for a person based on their actual or perceived [[Sex assignment|sex]]. These are usually centered around opposing conceptions of [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]], although there are myriad [[Third gender|exceptions]] and [[genderqueer|variations]]. The specifics regarding these gendered expectations may vary substantially among cultures, while other characteristics may be common throughout a range of cultures. There is ongoing debate as to what extent gender roles and their variations are [[Sex differences in humans|biologically determined]], and to what extent they are [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]].

Various groups have led efforts to change aspects of prevailing gender roles that they believe are oppressive or inaccurate, most notably the [[feminism|feminist movement]].

The term 'gender role' was first coined by [[John Money]] in 1955 during the course of his study of [[intersex]] individuals to describe the manners in which these individuals express their status as a [[male]] or [[female]], in a situation where no clear biological assignment exists.

==Background==
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) defines gender roles as "socially constructed roles, behaviours, activities and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women".&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/gender/whatisgender/en/index.html |title=What do we mean by "sex" and "gender"? |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |website=WHO.int |publisher=World Health Organization |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818074425/http://apps.who.int/gender/whatisgender/en/index.html |archivedate=2015-08-18 |accessdate=2015-08-18 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However debate continues as to what extent gender and its roles are socially constructed (i.e. non-biologically influenced), and to what extent "socially constructed" may be considered synonymous with "arbitrary" or "malleable".&lt;ref&gt;The social construction of race. The Atlantic. http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/05/the-social-construction-of-race/275974/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry, S. (2009) Social construction of crime. In J. Miller (Ed.), 21st Century criminology: A reference handbook. (pp. 296-306). Thousand Oaks: SAGE Publications, Inc. doi: 10.4135/9781412971997.n34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, I (1999) The social construction of what?.

Family Futures : Issues in Research and Policy 7th Australian Institute of Family Studies Conference http://www.aifs.gov.au/conferences/aifs7/francis.html&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a concise authoritative definition of gender roles or gender itself is elusive.

Some systems of classification, unlike the WHO, are non-binary or [[gender queer]], listing multiple possible genders including transgender and intersex as distinct categories.&lt;ref&gt;Federation of Gay Games 2010 Gay Games VIII Gender Identity Policy http://www.transgenderlaw.org/resources/FederationGayGamesPolicy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sykes, H. (2006) Transsexual and Transgender Policies in Sports WSPAJ Vol. 15, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Gender roles are culturally specific, and while most cultures distinguish only two ([[boy]] and [[girl]] or [[man]] and [[woman]]), others recognize more. [[Androgyny]], for example, has been proposed as a [[third gender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eleanor Emmons|first=Maccoby|title=The Development of Sex Differences|year=1966|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, Calif.|isbn=978-0-8047-0308-6|pages=25–55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_jumAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Sex differences in intellectual functioning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other societies have claimed to see more than five genders,&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;Graham, Sharyn (2001), [http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090604031253/http://insideindonesia.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=982&amp;Itemid=29/edit66/bissu2.htm Sulawesi's fifth gender], Inside Indonesia, April–June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and some non-Western societies have three genders – man, woman and third gender.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe, Will (2000).

Gender role, referring in some sense to cultural expectations according to an understood gender classification, should not be confused with [[gender identity]], the internal sense of one's own gender, which may or may not align with categories offered by societal norms. The point at which these internalized gender identities become externalized into a set of expectations is the genesis of a gender role.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, P.; Kless, S.; Adler, P (1992)Socialization to gender roles: Popularity among elementary school boys and girls. Sociology of education vol. 65 pp. 169-087&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Acker, J (1992) From sex roles to gendered institutions. Contemporary Sociology: A Journal of Reviews vol. 21 no. 565-569&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender roles are usually referenced in a pejorative sense, as an institution that restricts freedom of behavior and expression, or are used as a basis for discrimination. Due to the prevailing gender role of general subordination, women were not granted [[Women's suffrage|the right to vote]] in many parts of the world until the 19th or 20th centuries, some well into the 21st.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/10/in-saudi-arabia-a-quiet-step-forward-for-women/247351/ "In Saudi Arabia, a Quiet Step Forward for Women"]. The Atlantic. Oct 26 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Women throughout the world, in myriad respects, do not enjoy full freedom and protection under the law (see [[Women's rights]]). Due to the prevailing perception of men as primarily breadwinners, they are seldom afforded the benefit of [[paternity leave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/2853080/fathers-day-gift-paternity-leave-feminism-for-men/|title=it's time for paternity leave for working fathers|author=James Poniewozik|work=TIME.com|accessdate=14 June 2015|date=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender roles may also be experienced negatively by those who are, or are perceived to be members of a group, but who do not conform to established norms. For example, Morgan examines the plight of homosexuals seeking political asylum from homophobic persecution who have been turned away by US customs for not being "gay enough", that is, not sufficiently conforming to the standard western conception of the gender roles occupied by gays and lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, D. (2006) Not gay enough for the government: Racial and sexual stereotypes in sexual orientation asylum cases. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Legal Issues http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/lsex15&amp;div=9&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals#141&lt;/ref&gt; Mohammad, a gay man from Iran, was asked by his immigration officer "how she was supposed to believe he was gay when he was 'not feminine in any way'". His application was initially denied but later granted on appeal. Conversely, heterosexual men and women who are not sufficiently masculine or feminine may be persecuted for being homosexual.

Despite this, and for at least some individuals, gender roles may provide a positive effect and the absence of them may prove difficult. Whilst gender roles may be used as deleterious gender stereotypes, they can offer a clear avenue to verify and structure socially accepted behavior. Additionally, holding the view of one's self as fulfilling prescribed gender roles has been correlated with increased self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Frome, P. &amp; Eccles (1996) Gender roles identity and self-esteem. Poster presented at the biannual meeting of the Society for Research on Adolescence.&lt;/ref&gt; As Kelsey, who self identifies as gender neutral phrased it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It just makes me feel separated from society, when we have to keep talking about it. It’s like — am I even human?...I mean, I know I’m not normal."&lt;ref&gt;The Washington Post. When no gender fits: A quest to be seen as just a person. http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/when-no-gender-fits-a-quest-to-be-seen-as-just-a-person/2014/09/20/1ab21e6e-2c7b-11e4-994d-202962a9150c_story.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Theories of the social construction of gender==
{{Main|Social construction of gender difference}}

Children learn to categorize themselves by gender usually by the age of 3.&lt;ref name="Pate"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pate|first=J. s.d |title=What everyone should know about gender and sexuality|url=http://jamespatemd.com/Pubs/gendersexuality.htm|website=jamespatemd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; From birth, children learn gender stereotypes and roles from their parents and environment. In a traditional view, males learn to manipulate their physical and social environment through physical strength or dexterity, while girls learn to present themselves as objects to be viewed.&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, S. E. (1986) Language practices and self definition: The case of gender identity acquisition. The sociological Quarterly vol. 27, issue 3, pp 295-311&lt;/ref&gt;  Social constructionists claim for example that gender-segregated children's activities create the appearance that gender differences in behavior reflect an essential nature of male and female behavior.&lt;ref name="Fenstermaker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fenstermaker|first=Sarah|title=Doing Gender, Doing Difference: Inequality, Power, and Institutional Change|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-93179-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7vLBpyjCFwsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=WDazWa1RCV&amp;dq=Doing%20gender%2C%20doing%20difference&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender role theory “treats these differing distributions of women and men into roles as the primary origin of sex-differentiated social behavior, their impact on behavior is mediated by psychological and social processes”&lt;ref&gt;Eagly, A.H. (1997). Sex differences in social behavior: Comparing social role theory and evolutionary psychology. American Psychologist, December, 1380-1383.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gilbert, gender roles arose from correspondent inference, meaning that general labor division was extended to gender roles.  Socially constructed gender roles are considered to be hierarchical and characterized as a male-advantaged gender hierarchy by social constructionists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = W. | last2 = Eagly | first2 = A.

Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association. {{DOI|10.1037/10683-003}}&lt;/ref&gt; because roles and stereotypes are both socially shared descriptive norms and prescriptive norms.

[[Judith Butler]],&lt;ref&gt;Butler, J. (1990). {{Full|date=December 2012}} ‘’Gender trouble: Feminism and the subversion of identity.’’ New York; Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; in works such as ''[[Gender Trouble]]'' and ''[[Undoing Gender]]'', contends that being female is not "natural" and that it appears natural only through repeated performances of gender; these performances in turn, reproduce and define the traditional categories of sex and/or gender.

=== Talcott Parsons' view ===
Working in the [[United States]], [[Talcott Parsons]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arte-tv.com Franco-German TV Station ARTE], Karambolage, August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; developed a model of the [[nuclear family]] in 1955, which at that place and time was the prevalent family structure. It compared a strictly traditional view of gender roles (from an industrial-age American perspective) with a more liberal view.

The Parsons model was used to contrast and illustrate extreme positions on gender roles. Model A describes total separation of male and female roles, while Model B describes the complete dissolution of gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;Brockhaus: Enzyklopädie der Psychologie, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; (The examples are based on the context of the culture and [[infrastructure]] of the United States.)

{| border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse;" class="wikitable"

! Model A – Total role segregation !! Model B – Total integration of roles
|-
| '''[[Education]]'''
| Gender-specific education; high professional qualification is important only for the man
| Co-educative schools, same content of classes for girls and boys, same qualification for men and women.
|-
| '''[[Profession]]'''
| The workplace is not the primary area of women; career and professional advancement is deemed unimportant for women
| For women, career is just as important as for men; equal professional opportunities for men and women are necessary.
|-
| '''Housework'''
| Housekeeping and child care are the primary functions of the woman; participation of the man in these functions is only partially wanted.
| All housework is done by both parties to the marriage in equal shares.
|-
| '''[[Decision making]]'''
| In case of conflict, man has the last say, for example in choosing the place to live, choice of school for children, buying decisions
| Neither partner dominates; solutions do not always follow the principle of finding a concerted decision; [[status quo]] is maintained if disagreement occurs.
|-
| '''Child care and education'''
| Woman takes care of the largest part of these functions; she educates children and cares for them in every way
| Man and woman share these functions equally.
|}

However, these structured positions become less common in a liberal-individualist society; {{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and the actual behavior of individuals is usually somewhere between these poles.

According to the interactionist approach, roles (including gender roles) are not fixed, but are constantly negotiated between individuals. In North America and southern South America, this is the most common approach among families whose business is [[agriculture]].

Gender roles can influence all kinds of behaviors, such as choice of clothing, choice of work and personal relationships, e.g., parental status (See also [[Sociology of fatherhood]]).

===Geert Hofstede's views===
[[File:Landsdowne Herakles.jpg|thumb|In Greek mythology, [[Heracles]] is synonymous with [[Apollonian]] masculinity.]]
[[Geert Hofstede]] is a Dutch researcher and social psychologist who dedicated himself to the study of culture. Hofstede sees culture as "broad patterns of thinking, feeling and acting" in a society&lt;ref&gt;Hoststede, Geert. 1998. Masculinity and Femininity: The Taboo Dimension of National Cultures. page 5&lt;/ref&gt; In Hofstede’s view, masculinity and femininity differ in the social roles that are associated with the biological fact of the existence of the two sexes. Masculinity and femininity refer to the dominant sex role pattern in the vast majority of both traditional and modern societies: that of male assertiveness and female nurturance.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, G. (1980). Culture’s consequences: international differences in work-related values. Beverly Hills, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Femininity: “Femininity stands for a society in which social gender roles overlap: Both men and women are supposed to be modest, tender, and concerned with the quality of life”&lt;ref name="Hof 2001"&gt;Hofstede (2001), Culture’s Consequences, 2nd ed.  p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

Masculinity: “Masculinity stands for a society in which social gender roles are clearly distinct: Men are supposed to be assertive, tough, and focused on material success; women are supposed to be more modest, tender, and concerned with the quality of life”&lt;ref name="Hof 2001" /&gt;

Hofstede's Feminine and Masculine Culture Dimensions:“Masculine cultures expect men to be assertive, ambitious and competitive, to strive for material success, and to respect whatever is big, strong, and fast. Masculine cultures expect women to serve and care for the non-material quality of life, for children and for the weak. Feminine cultures, on the other hand, deﬁne relatively overlapping social roles for the sexes, in which, in particular, men need not be ambitious or competitive but may go for a different quality of life than material success; men may respect whatever is small, weak, and slow".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hofstede | first1 = G | year = 1986 | title = Cultural differences in teaching and learning | url = | journal = International Journal of Intercultural Relations | volume = 10 | issue = 3| page = 308 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In feminine cultures, modesty and relations are important characteristics.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} This differs from in masculine cultures, where self-enhancement leads to self-esteem. Masculine cultures are individualistic, and feminine cultures are more collective because of the significance of personal relationships. “The dominant values in a masculine society are achievement and success; the dominant values in a feminine society are caring for others and quality of life”.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, Geert, and Marieke De Mooij. (2010). "The Hofstede Model: Applications to Global Branding and Advertising Strategy and Research." International Journal of Advertising.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2012}}

===Albert Ellis' views===
In the 1940s, [[Albert Ellis]] studied eighty-four cases of mixed births and concluded that "while the power of the human sex drive may possibly be largely dependent on physiological factors... the direction of this drive does not seem to be directly dependent on constitutional element." In other words, in the development of masculinity, femininity, and inclinations towards homosexuality or heterosexuality, nurture matters a great deal more than nature.&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling, Anne 2000"&gt;Fausto-Sterling, Anne (2000). Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction of sexuality. New York: Basic Books. ISBN 0-465-07714-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Money's views===
In the 1950s [[John Money]], along with colleagues took up the study of [[intersex]]uals, who, Money realized, "would provide invaluable material for the comparative study for bodily form and physiology, rearing, and [[psychosexual]] orientation." Money and his colleagues used their own studies to state in the extreme what these days seems extraordinary for its complete denial of the notion of natural inclination.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling, A (2008) Sexing the body: Gender politics and the construction of sexuality. Basic Books. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that [[gonads]], [[hormones]], and [[chromosomes]] did not automatically determine a child's gender role.&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling, Anne 2000"/&gt; Among the many terms he coined was ''gender role'' which he defined in a seminal 1955 paper as "all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman".&lt;ref name=Basic-Concepts&gt;{{cite journal |last=Money |first=John |authorlink1=John Money |last2=Hampson |first2=Joan G |last3=Hampson |first3=John |date=October 1955 |title=An Examination of Some Basic Sexual Concepts: The Evidence of Human Hermaphroditism |url= |journal=Bull. Johns Hopkins Hosp. |publisher=Johns Hopkins University |volume=97 |issue=4 |pages=301–19 |doi= |accessdate=19 November 2014 |quote=By the term, gender role, we mean all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman, respectively.  It includes, but is not restricted to sexuality in the sense of eroticism.  Gender role is appraised in relation to the following: general mannerisms, deportment and demeanor, play preferences and recreational interests; spontaneous topics of talk in unprompted conversation and casual comment; content of dreams, daydreams, and fantasies; replies to oblique inquiries and projective tests; evidence of erotic practices and, finally, the person's own replies to direct inquiry.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the majority of Money's theories regarding the importance of socialization in the determination of gender have come under intense criticism, especially in connection with the false reporting of success in the '[[John/Joan]]' case (see [[David Reimer]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Colapinto|first=J.|title=The True Story of John/Joan|work=The Rolling Stone|date=December 11, 1997|pages=54–97|url=http://www.healthyplace.com/gender/inside-intersexuality/the-true-story-of-john-joan/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colapinto, J.

== Anthropology and evolution ==
{{Main|Sex differences in humans}}{{See also|Sex and psychology|Sex determination and differentiation (human)|Cross-cultural psychology#Gender-Role Differences}}
[[File:Dahomey-amazoner.jpg|thumb| From approximately 1700 through 1900 women served as soldiers for the kingdom of [[Dahomey]], a slave-trading nation.]]
The idea that differences in gender roles originate in differences in biology has found support in parts of the scientific community. 19th-century [[anthropology]] sometimes used descriptions of the imagined life of [[paleolithic]] [[hunter-gatherer]] societies for evolutionary explanations for gender differences.{{Weasel-inline|date=December 2012}} For example, those accounts maintain that the need to take care of offspring may have limited the females' freedom to hunt and assume positions of power.{{Weasel-inline|date=December 2012}}

Because of the influence of (among others) [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s feminist works and [[Michel Foucault]]'s reflections on sexuality, the idea that [[gender]] was unrelated to sex gained ground during the 1980s, especially in sociology and cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Bergoffen, Debra, "Simone de Beauvoir", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/beauvoir/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; This view asserts that the relationship between gender and sex (presence of genitals/gonads) is not causally determinate. That is, that one may have the genitals of one sex while having the gender of another.&lt;ref&gt;Connell, Robert William: Gender and Power, Cambridge: University Press 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maria Lugones]] observes that among the [[Yoruba people]] there was no concept of gender and no gender system whatsoever before [[colonialism]]. She argues that colonial powers used a gender system as a tool for domination and fundamentally changing social relations among the indigenous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lugones|first=María|title=Heterosexualism and the Colonial/Modern Gender System|journal=Hypatia|date=Winter 2008|volume= 22|issue= 1|accessdate=9 May 2011|pages=196–198|doi=10.1353/hyp.2006.0067}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there continues to be debate on the subject. [[Simon Baron-Cohen]], a Cambridge Univ. professor of psychology and psychiatry, claims that "the female brain is predominantly "hard-wired" for empathy, while the male brain is predominantly "hard-wired" for understanding and building systems."&lt;ref&gt;Baron-Cohen, S (2003) The Essential Difference: men, women and the extreme male brain. Penguin/Basic Books. ISBN 978-0-7139-9671-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies have been conducted on situations where a child was either raised believing that he or she was of opposite sex, or in conditions where the sex was changed using medical procedure at a young age. One study looked at female infants that suffered from [[adrenal hyperplasia]], and who had excess male hormone release, but were thought to be females and raised as such by their parents. These girls expressed higher than normal masculine behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berenbaum|first1=Sheri A.|last2=Hines|first2=Melissa|year=1992|title=Early androgens are related to childhood sex-typed toy preferences|work=Psychological Science 3|pages=203–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psy2.ucsd.edu/~mgorman/Berenbaum.pdf|title=Gorman Lab|author=Sven Design|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study looked at 18 male infants with a genetic disorder where their genitals are disformed so that their parents believed them to be girls. At adult age only one of these attempted to adapt a female role and express female behavioral patterns, but she was in psychiatric care because of gender-roles issues, all the others being stereotypically male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Imperato-McGinley|first=J|author2=Peterson, RE |author3=Gautier, T |author4= Sturla, E |title=Androgens and the evolution of male-gender identity among male pseudohermaphrodites with 5alpha-reductase deficiency.|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=May 31, 1979|volume=300|issue=22|pages=1233–7|pmid=431680|doi=10.1056/NEJM197905313002201}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a third study, 14 male children born with [[cloacal exstrophy]] and reassigned female at birth by gender change operations were looked at.

[[Sandra Bem|Dr. Sandra Lipsitz Bem]] is a psychologist who developed the gender schema theory to explain how individuals come to use gender as an organizing category in all aspects of their life.  It is based on the combination of aspects of the [[social cognitive theory|social learning theory]] and the [[theory of cognitive development|cognitive-development theory]] of sex role acquisition.  In 1971, she created the [[Bem Sex Role Inventory]] to measure how well you fit into your traditional gender role by characterizing your personality as masculine, feminine, androgynous, or undifferentiated.  She believed that through gender-schematic processing, a person spontaneously sorts attributes and behaviors into masculine and feminine categories.  Therefore, an individual processes information and regulate their behavior based on whatever definitions of [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]] their culture provides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bem|first=Sandra L.|title=Gender schema theory: A cognitive account of sex typing.|journal=Psychological Review|date=July 1981|volume=88|issue=4|pages=354–364|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.88.4.354|url=https://www.ahcafr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/gender_schema_theory.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current trend in Western societies toward men and women sharing similar occupations, responsibilities and jobs suggests that the sex one is born with does not directly determine one's abilities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mrDwXSw2w5YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=gender+biological+difference&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NlswT4SZKcisiQKVt7ijAw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=gender%20biological%20difference&amp;f=false Gender Gap:  The Biology of Male-Female Differences].

In addition, research at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center has also shown that gender roles may be biological among primates. Yerkes researchers studied the interactions of 11 male and 23 female [[Rhesus monkey]]s with human toys, both wheeled and plush. The males played mostly with the wheeled toys while the females played with both types equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yerkes.emory.edu/about/news/developmental_cognitive_neuroscience/toy_preferences.html |title=Yerkes Researchers Find Sex Differences in Monkey Toy Preferences Similar to Humans |publisher=Yerkes National Primate Research Center |date=April 10, 2008 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Study co-author Kim Wallen has, however, warned against overinterpeting the results as the color and size of the toys may also have been factors in the monkey's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13596-male-monkeys-prefer-boys-toys.html |title=Male monkeys prefer boys' toys |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2008.03.008 |publisher=New Scientist |accessdate=2010-04-17 |journal=Hormones and Behavior |date=2008 |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=359–364 |first=Janice M. |last=Hassett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas of appropriate behavior according to gender vary among cultures and era, although some aspects receive more widespread attention than others. [[R.W. Connell]] in ''Men, Masculinities and Feminism''&lt;ref&gt;Connell, Raewyn, Ph.D. "Men, Masculinities and Feminism." Social Alternatives July 1997: 7-10. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; claims:

:"There are cultures where it has been normal, not exceptional, for men to have homosexual relations. There have been periods in 'Western' history when the modern convention that men suppress displays of emotion did not apply at all, when men were demonstrative about their feeling for their friends. Mateship in the Australian outback last century is a case in point."

There are huge areal differences in attitudes towards appropriate gender roles. For example, in the ''[[World Values Survey]]'', responders were asked if they thought that wage work should be restricted to only men in the case of shortage in jobs. While in Iceland the proportion that agreed was 3.6%, in Egypt it was 94.9%.&lt;ref&gt;Fortin, Nicole, "Gender Role Attitudes and the Labour Market Outcomes of Women Across OECD Countries," Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 2005, 21, 416–438.&lt;/ref&gt; Attitudes have also varied historically, for example, in Europe, during the Middle Ages, women were commonly associated with roles related to medicine and healing.&lt;ref name=Ehrenreich&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrenreich|first=Barbara|title=Witches, Midwives and Nurses: A History of Women Healers|year=2010|publisher=The Feminist Press|isbn=0-912670-13-4|pages=44–87|edition=2nd|author2=Deirdre English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the rise of [[witch-hunt]]s across Europe and the institutionalization of medicine, these roles eventually came to be monopolized by men.&lt;ref name=Ehrenreich/&gt; In the last few decades, however, these roles have become largely gender-neutral in Western society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boulis|first=Ann K.|title=The changing face of medicine: women doctors and the evolution of health care in America|year=2010|publisher=ILR|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=0-8014-7662-3|author2=Jacobs, Jerry A.|quote=Encouraging one's daughter to pursue a career in medicine is no longer an unusual idea… Americans are now more likely to report that they feel comfortable recommending a career in medicine for a young woman than for a young man.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vern Bullough]] stated that homosexual communities are generally more tolerant of switching gender roles.&lt;ref name=Bullough&gt;{{cite book|last=Bullough |first=Vern L.|title=Crossdressing, Sex, and Gender|year=1993|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press. 1993 |isbn=978-0-8122-1431-4|page=390|edition=1st|author2=Bonnie Bullough}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, someone with a masculine voice, a five o'clock shadow (or a fuller beard), an [[Adam's apple]], etc., wearing a woman's dress and high heels, carrying a purse, etc., would most likely draw ridicule or other unfriendly attention in ordinary social contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith, Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity, Routledge, New York, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam, Judith, Female Masculinity, Duke University Press, Durham and London, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Julia, Straub, Kristina; Eds, Body Guards: The Cultural Politics of Gender Ambiguity, Routledge, London, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Because the dominant class sees this form of gender expression as unacceptable, inappropriate, or perhaps threatening, these individuals are significantly more likely to experience discrimination and harassment both in their personal lives and from their employer.&lt;ref&gt;https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/issues/2011/06/pdf/workplace_discrimination.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender roles may be a means through which one expresses their [[gender identity]], but they may also be employed as a means of exerting [[social control]], and individuals may experience negative social consequences for violating them.&lt;ref&gt;Hackman, J.R.

{{main|Gender roles in Christianity}}
{{see also|Christian views on marriage}}

''I Corinthians,'' 11:14 and 15 indicates that it is inappropriate for a man to wear his hair long, and good for a woman to wear her hair long.

The roles of women in Christianity can vary considerably today as they have varied historically since the first century New Testament church. This is especially true in marriage and in formal ministry positions within certain Christian denominations, churches, and [[parachurch organizations]].

Many leadership roles in the organized church have been restricted to males. In the [[Sex, gender and the Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] churches, only men may serve as priests or deacons; only males serve in senior leadership positions such as [[pope]], [[patriarch]], and [[bishop]]. Women may serve as [[abbess]]es. Most mainstream [[Protestants|Protestant]] denominations are beginning to relax their longstanding constraints on ordaining women to be ministers, though some large groups are tightening their constraints in reaction. [[Charismatic]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] churches have embraced the ordination of women since their founding.

Christian traditions that officially recognize ''saints'' as persons of exceptional holiness of life do list women in that group. Most prominent is [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, mother of Jesus]] who is highly revered throughout Christianity, particularly in Roman Catholicism where she is considered the "Mother of God". Women prominent in Christianity have included contemporaries of Jesus, subsequent theologians, abbesses, mystics, [[doctors of the church]], founders of religious orders, military leaders, monarchs and martyrs, evidencing the variety of roles played by women within the life of Christianity. [[Paul the Apostle and women|Paul the Apostle]] held women in high regard and worthy of prominent positions in the church, though he was careful not to encourage disregard for the [[New Testament household codes]], also known as New Testament Domestic Codes or ''Haustafelen'', of [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman law]] in the first century.

'''Islam'''
{{see also|Marriage in Islam}}
Muhammad described the high status of mothers in both of the major hadith Collections (Bukhari and Muslim). One famous account is:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;"A man asked the Prophet: 'Whom should I honor most?' The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother!'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your father'"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Hinduism'''
{{main|God and gender in Hinduism}}
Hindu deities are more ambiguously gendered than deities of other world religions, such as Christianity, Islam, and others. This informs female and males relations, and informs how the differences between males and females are understood&lt;ref&gt;Gopal, Madan (1990). K.S. Gautam, ed. India through the ages. Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:God marriage AS.jpg|thumb|Image of [[Ardhanarishvara]]]]  However, in a religious cosmology like [[Hinduism]], which prominently features female and androgynous deities, some gender transgression is allowed. This group is known as the [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijras]], and has a long tradition of performing in important rituals, such as the birth of sons and weddings. Despite this allowance for transgression, Hindu cultural traditions portray women in contradictory ways.  On one hand, women’s fertility is given great value, and on the other, female sexuality is depicted as potentially dangerous and destructive.&lt;ref name="Peletz"&gt;Peletz, Michael Gates.

===Studies on marriage in the U.S.===
{{see also|Marriage}}
In the U.S., single men are outnumbered by single women at a ratio of 100 single women to every 86 single men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pritchard|first=Justin|title=Men hold the edge on gender gap odds|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-6970963.html|newspaper=Oakland Tribune|date=October 21, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; though never-married men over age 15 outnumber women by a 5:4 ratio (33.9% to 27.3%) according to the 2006 U.S. Census American Community Survey. This very much depends on age group, with 118 single men per 100 single women in their 20s, versus 33 single men to 100 single women over 65.&lt;ref&gt;Facts for features: Valentine's Day U.S. Census Bureau Report February 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The numbers are different in other countries. For example, China has many more young men than young women, and this disparity is expected to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCurry|first=Justin|title=40m bachelors and no women ... the birth of a new problem for China|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/mar/09/china.justinmccurry|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 March 2004|author2=Allison, Rebecca|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regions with recent conflict such as Chechnya, women may greatly outnumber men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Polygamy proposal for Chechen men|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4610396.stm|newspaper=BBC News|date=13 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a cross-cultural study by [[David Buss]], men and women were asked to rank certain traits in order of importance in a long-term partner. Both men and women ranked "kindness" and "intelligence" as the two most important factors. Men valued beauty and youth more highly than women, while women valued financial and social status more highly than men.

=== Changing roles ===

Societies can change such that the gender roles rapidly change. The 21st century has seen a shift in gender roles due to multiple factors such as new family structures, education, media, and several others. A 2003 survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated that about 1/3 of wives earn more than their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/27/business/27instincts.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=M.P. | last=Dunleavey | title=A Breadwinner Rethinks Gender Roles | date=27 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the importance of education emphasized nationwide, and the access of college degrees (online, for example), women have begun furthering their education. Family structures are changing, and the number of single-mother or single-father households is increasing.

Fathers are also becoming more involved with raising their children, instead of the responsibility resting solely with the mother. According to the Pew Research Center, the number of stay-at-home fathers in the US nearly doubled in the period from 1989 to 2012, from 1.1 million to 2.0 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/06/05/growing-number-of-dads-home-with-the-kids/|title=Growing Number of Stay-at-Home Dads - Pew Research Center|date=5 June 2014|work=Pew Research Center’s Social &amp; Demographic Trends Project|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend appears to be mirrored in a number of countries including the UK, Canada and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/9822271/Rise-in-stay-at-home-fathers-fuelled-by-growing-numbers-of-female-breadwinners.html|title=Rise in stay-at-home fathers fuelled by growing numbers of female breadwinners|author=Louisa Peacock and Sam Marsden|date=23 January 2013|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=14 June 2015|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/parenting/stay-at-home-dads-on-the-rise-increasingly-because-they-want-to-be/article19014624/|title=Stay-at-home dads on the rise – increasingly because they want to be|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=14 June 2015|location=Toronto|date=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/06/sweden-sees-boom-in-stay-at-home-dads/|title=Sweden sees boom in stay-at-home dads|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pew also found that, at least in the US, public opinion in general appears to show a substantial bias toward favoring a mother as a care-taker verses a father, regardless of any shift in actual roles each plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/29/breadwinner-moms/|title=Breadwinner Moms|date=29 May 2013|work=Pew Research Center’s Social &amp; Demographic Trends Project|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender equality allows gender roles to become less distinct and according to Donnalyn Pompper, is the reason "men no longer own breadwinning identities and, like women, their bodies are objectified in mass media images."&lt;ref&gt;Pompper, Donnalyn.

According to Chang, Lei, the gender attitudes along both domains of work and domestic roles can be measured through the development and validation of a cross-cultural gender role attitudes test. The psychological processes of the East have been supervised through a Western instrument after a translation of the instrument into an Eastern language. The North American instruments of gender role attitudes include the Attitudes Towards Women Scale, the Sex-Role Egalitarian Scale, and Sex-Role Ideology Scale. Through the test, it is known that even American Southerners "lag behind their northern counterparts in egalitarian gender views."&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Lei. "Gender Role Egalitarian Attitudes in Beijing, Hong Kong, Florida, and Michigan." Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology 30.6 (1999): 722-41. Web. 17 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It is inevitable for the gender views to be not affected from one’s culture, even if it is just few hundred miles away. Although there were existing studies that have focused on the general gender views or gender attitudes that are work related, there has not been a study of specific domestic roles. Supporting the findings of Hofstede (1980), which explained that the “high masculinity cultures are associated with low percentages of women holding professional and technical employment,” the test values of the work-related gender role egalitarian was less for the Chinese than the Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede&lt;/ref&gt; The population proportion of women who held professional job in China was far less than that of America, which also justifies this test data. The test data is a clear portrayal of women’s limitations in our current society in the Eastern culture.

As Hofstede mentioned, high masculinity cultures are associated with low percentages of women holding professional and technical employment; The Matter of Seggri is a great tool that exaggerates the women’s lack of power, and it gives lucid visualizations for the readers. Considering the domestic gender roles, there were surprisingly no difference between the viewpoint of Chinese and that of Americans. From these studies, one may conclude that the Chinese women would have higher expectations of men than American women, assuming their domestic roles.

Not only there exist regional differences among people's [[cultural differences]], but also emotional differences among cultural distinctions. The study, according to Richard Bagozzi, Nancy Wong, and Youjae Yi, proves the direct relationship between the culture and gender that interact to produce distinct patterns of association between positive and negative emotions.  During the research, United States is considered more “independent-based culture,” while China is considered “interdependent-based culture.” People in the U.S. generally experience emotion in oppositional ways, whereas Chinese people are closer to experience emotion in dialectal way. The study has continued with sets of psychological tests among university students in Beijing, and those in Michigan. The fundamental goals of the research were to show the "gender differences in emotions are adaptive for the differing roles that males and females play in the culture.” The evidence for differences in gender role is found during the [[socialization]] in work experiment: the research proves that "women are socialized to be more expressive of their feelings and to show this to a greater extent in facial expressions and gestures, as well as by verbal means."&lt;ref&gt;Bagozzi, Richard P., Nancy Wong, and Youjae Yi. "The Role of Culture and Gender in the Relationship between Positive and Negative Affect." Cognition &amp; Emotion 13.6 (1999): 641-72. Web. 17 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a pure instance of the gender differences between men and women, and the study extends to the biological characteristics of both men and women to discuss and justify the hypothesis that they made.

Due to the higher association between PA and NA hormones in memory for women, cultural patterns described above becomes more evident for women than men. In addition to the two studies above, another research, according to Jin, Jiafei, Patricia Fosh, and Chih-Chieh Chen, proves exactly the same point through some different sets of test.  The gender theories are explained, and through the case-study investigation, where Chinese workers join the Western partners, the research includes the worker's attitudes to Western MNC's that demonstrate different HR practice. The pure goal of the research is to prove that the gender played an intervening role between organizational structure and worker's attitude. Through physiological questionnaire responses, the attitudes towards their jobs and companies became moderately positive when working for a foreign direct investment (FIE) compared with their attitudes when working for non-FIEs.&lt;ref&gt;Jin, Jiafei, Patricia Fosh, and Chih-Chieh Chen. "When East Meets West: Interaction Effects Of Organistional Ownership Structure, Gender And (Un)Met Expectations On Workers' Attitudes In China." International Journal Of Human Resource Management 23.1 (2012): 18-34 Sociological Collection. Web. 17 Apr. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Because the result, through a different set of test, shows an instance of Bagozzi’s research, it can be considered an inferable proof of his research.

==Communication==
{{See also|Language and gender|Gender differences in social network service use|Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures}}
Gender communication is viewed as a form of intercultural communication, and gender is both an influence on and a product of communication. Communication takes a large part in the process in which we become male or female because males and females are taught difference linguistic practices. For example, females are often more expressive and intuitive in their communication, while males tend to be instrumental and competitive. In addition, there are differences in accepted communication behaviors for males and females. To improve communication between genders, one must understand these differences found in the opposite sex.&lt;ref&gt;"Gender Differences in Communication." Intercultural Communication: A Global Reader. Ed. Fred E. Jandt. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2004. 221–29. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonverbal communication===
Hall published an observational study on nonverbal gender differences and discussed the cultural reasons as to those differences.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, J. A. (1990). Nonverbal sex differences: Accuracy of communication and expressive style. Baltimore, MD, US: Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In her study, she noted women as smiling and laughing more, as well as having a better understanding of others’ nonverbal cues.  She believed that women were encouraged to be more emotionally expressive in their language, thus better developed in nonverbal communication.  Men, on the other hand, were taught to be less expressive, to suppress their emotions, and thus be less nonverbally active in communication and more sporadic in their use of nonverbal cues. Most studies researching nonverbal communication described women as being more expressively and judgmentally accurate in nonverbal communication when it was linked to emotional expression; other nonverbal expressions were similar or the same for both genders.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, A. H. (2000). Gender and emotion: Social psychologica perspectives. Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  McQuiston and Morris also noted a major difference in men and women’s nonverbal communication; men tended to show body language linked to dominance, like eye contact and interpersonal distance, more than women.&lt;ref&gt;McQuiston, D., &amp; Morris, K. A. (2009). Gender differences in communication: Implications for salespeople. Journal of Selling &amp; Major Account Management, 9(4), 54–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication and gender cultures===
[[File:Personality and gender word cloud for social media.png|thumb|right|Words, phrases, and topics most highly distinguishing English-speaking females and males in social media in 2013]]
According to Julia Wood, there are distinct communication "culture" for women and men in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, J (2010) Gendered lives: Communication, gender and culture. Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; Wood believes that in addition to female and male communication cultures, there are also specific communications cultures for African Americans, older people, Indian Native Americans, gay men, lesbians, and people with disabilities. According to Wood, it is generally thought that biological sex is behind the distinct ways of communicating, but in reality the root is "gender".&lt;ref&gt;Wood, J (2010) Gendered lives: Communication, gender and culture. Cengage Learning. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Maltz and Broker’s research suggested that the games children play may contribute to socializing children into [[Masculinity|masculine]] and [[Femininity|feminine]] gender roles.&lt;ref name="maltz"&gt;Maltz, D., &amp; Borker, R. (1982). A cultural approach to male-female miscommunication. In J. Gumperz (Ed.), Language and social identity (pp. 196–216). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, girls being encouraged to play "house" may promotes stereotypically feminine traits, and may promote interpersonal relationships as playing house does not necessarily have fixed rules or objectives.  Boys, however, tended to play more competitive and adversarial team sports with structured, predetermined goals and a range of confined strategies.

=== Communication and sexual desire ===
Mets, et al.&lt;ref name="metts"&gt;Metts, S., Sprecher, S., &amp; Regan, P. C. (1998). Communication and sexual desire. In P. A. Andersen &amp; L. K. Guerrero (Eds.) Handbook of communication and emotion. (pp. 354–377). San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; explain that [[Libido|sexual desire]] is linked to emotions and communicative expression. Communication is central in expressing sexual desire and "complicated emotional states," and is also the "mechanism for negotiating the relationship implications of [[Human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] and emotional meanings." Gender differences appear to exist in communicating sexual desire.

For example, masculine people are generally perceived to be more interested in sex than feminine people, and research suggests that masculine people are more likely than feminine people to express their sexual interest.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R; Catanese, K &amp; Vohs, K (2001) Is there a gender difference in strength of sex drive? Theoretical views, conceptual distinctions, and a review of relevant evidence. Personality and Social Psychology Review August 2001 vol. 5 no. 3 pp. 242-273.&lt;/ref&gt; This may be greatly affected by masculine people being less inhibited by [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]] for expressing their desire, being more aware of their sexual desire or succumbing to the expectation of their gender culture.&lt;ref&gt;Seal, D &amp; Ehrhardt, A (2003) Masculinity and urban men: Perceived scripts for courtship, romantic, and sexual interactions with women. Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality: An International Journal for Research, Intervention and Care Volume 5, Issue 4. pp. 295-319&lt;/ref&gt; When feminine people employ tactics to show their sexual desire, they are typically more indirect in nature. On the other hand, it is known masculinity is associated with aggressive behavior in all mammals, and most likely explains at least part of the fact that masculine people are more likely to express their sexual interest. This is known as the [[Challenge hypothesis]].

Various studies show different communication strategies with a feminine person refusing a masculine person's sexual interest. Some research, like that of Murnen,&lt;ref name="murnen"&gt;Perot and Byrne Murnen SK, Perot A, Byrne D. Coping with unwanted sexual activity: Normative responses, situational determinants, and individual differences" ''Journal of Sex Research'' 1989;26(1) 85–106.,&lt;/ref&gt; show that when feminine people offer refusals, the refusals are verbal and typically direct.  When masculine people do not comply with this refusal, feminine people offer stronger and more direct refusals.  However, research from Perper and Weis&lt;ref name="perper"&gt;Perper, T., &amp; Weis, D. L. (1987). Proceptive and rejective strategies of U.S. and Canadian college women. The Journal of Sex Research, 23, 455-480.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that rejection includes acts of avoidance, creating distractions, making excuses, departure, hinting, arguments to delay, etc. These differences in refusal communication techniques are just one example of the importance of communicative competence for both masculine and feminine gender cultures.

A 1992 study tested gender stereotypes and labeling within young children.&lt;ref name="fagot"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Gender labeling, gender stereotyping, and parenting behaviors | author = Fagot, Beverly I.; Leinbach, Mary D.; O'Boyle, Cherie | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | year = 1992 | pages = 225–230 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.28.2.225}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The researchers divided this into two different studies. The first study investigated how children identified the differences between gender labels of boys and girls. The second study looked at both gender labeling and stereotyping in the relationship of mother and child.

Within the first study, 23 children between the ages of 2 and 7 underwent a series of gender labeling and gender stereotyping tests. These tests consisted of showing the children either pictures of males and females or objects such as a hammer or a broom and identifying or labeling those to a certain gender. The results of these tests showed that children under 3 years could make gender-stereotypic associations.&lt;ref name="fagot" /&gt;

The second study looked at gender labeling and stereotyping in the relationship of mother and child using three separate methods. The first consisted of identifying gender labeling and stereotyping, essentially the same method as the first study. The second consisted of behavioral observations, which looked at ten-minute play sessions with mother and child using gender specific toys. The third was a series of questionnaires such as an "Attitude Toward Women Scale", "[[Personal Attributes Questionnaire]]", and "Schaefer and Edgerton Scale" which looked at the family values of the mother.&lt;ref name="fagot" /&gt;

The results of these studies showed the same as the first study with regards to labeling and stereotyping. They also identified in the second method that the mothers positive reactions and responses to same-sex or opposite-sex toys played a role in how children identified them. Within the third method the results found that the mothers of the children who passed the “Gender Labeling Test”, had more traditional family values. These two studies, conducted by Beverly I. Fagot, Mar D. Leinbach and Cherie O'Boyle, showed that gender stereotyping and labeling is acquired at a very young age, and that social interactions and associations play a large role in how genders are identified.&lt;ref name="fagot" /&gt;

[[Virginia Woolf]], in the 1920s, made the point: "It is obvious that the values of women differ very often from the values which have been made by the other sex. Yet it is the masculine values that prevail".&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, V (1929) A room of one's own. NY 1929 p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty years later, psychologist [[Carol Gilligan]] was to take up the point, and use it to show that psychological tests of maturity have generally been based on masculine parameters, and so tended to show that women were less 'mature'. She countered this in her ground-breaking work, ''[[In a Different Voice]]'', holding that maturity in women is shown in terms of different, but equally important, human values.&lt;ref&gt;Gilligan, C. (2009) In a different voice. Harvard University Press, Jun 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender stereotypes are extremely common in society.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, H. (2012). List of gender stereotypes. Retrieved from http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/15910/1/List-of-Gender-Stereotypes.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Planned Parenthood Federation of America Inc. (2012). Gender and gender identity. Retrieved from http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/sexual-orientation-gender/gender-gender-identity-26530.htm&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons this may be is simply because it is easier on the brain to stereotype (see [[Heuristics in judgment and decision-making|Heuristics]]).  The brain has limited perceptual and memory systems, so it categorizes information into fewer and simpler units which allows for more efficient information processing.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, C. L., &amp; Halverson, C. F., "A Schematic Processing Model of Sex Typing and Stereotyping in Children", 1981 (4th ed., Vol. 52, pp. 1119–1134) {{JSTOR|1129498}}, November 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Gender stereotypes appear to have an effect at an early age. In one study, the effects of gender stereotypes on children's mathematical abilities were tested. In this study of American children between the ages of six and ten, it was found that the children, as early as the second grade, demonstrated the gender stereotype that math is for boys.  This may show that the math self-concepts are influenced before the age in which there are actual differences in math achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Cvencek, D., Meltzoff, A. N., &amp; Greenwald, A. G., ''Math–Gender Stereotypes in Elementary School Children'', 2011 (3rd ed., Vol. 62, pp. 776–779), {{DOI|10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01529.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study about gender stereotypes, it was found that parents' stereotypes interact with the sex of their child to directly influence the parents' beliefs about the child's abilities. In turn, parents' beliefs about their child directly influence their child's self-perceptions, and both the parents' stereotypes and the child's self-perceptions influence the child's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=J. E.|title=Influence of gender stereotypes on parent and child mathematics attitudes|year=1991|edition=4|volume= 83|pages=518–527|publisher=Journal of Educational Psychology|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/edu/83/4/518/|accessdate=November 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereotype threat is the implicit belief in gender stereotype that women perform worse than men in math, which is proposed to lead to lower performance by women. A recent review article of stereotype threat research related to the relationship between gender and math abilities concluded "that although stereotype threat may affect some women, the existing state of knowledge does not support the current level of enthusiasm for this as a mechanism underlying the gender gap in mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;Can stereotype threat explain the gender gap in mathematics performance and achievement? Stoet, Gijsbert; Geary, David C. Review of General Psychology, Vol 16(1), Mar 2012, 93–102. {{DOI|10.1037/a0026617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study, Deaux and her colleagues found that most people think women are more nurturant, but less self-assertive than men. Also, it is indicated universally. However, this awareness is related to women's role. That is, women do not have the nurturant personality by nature, but that personality is acquired by being in charge of the housework.&lt;ref&gt;Deaux, K., &amp; Lewis, L. (1984). Structure of gender stereotypes: Interrelationships among components and gender label. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,46,'' 991–1004.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the study of Jean Lipman-Blumen, women who grew up following traditional gender roles from childhood were less likely to want to be highly educated; women who were brought up with the view that men and women are equal were more likely to want higher education. This result shows that gender roles that have been passed down traditionally can influence stereotypes about gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lipman-Blumen | first1 = J | year = 1972 | title = How ideology shapes women's lives | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 226 | issue = 1| pages = 34–42 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0172-34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implicit gender stereotypes===

Gender stereotypes and roles can also be supported implicitly. [[Implicit stereotypes]]  are the unconscious influence of attitudes a person may or may not be aware that they hold. A person is influenced by these attitudes even though they are not aware. Gender stereotypes can also be held in this manner. These implicit stereotypes can often be demonstrated by the [[Implicit-association test]] (IAT).

One example of an implicit gender stereotype is that males are seen as better at math than are females. It has been found that men have stronger positive associations with math than do women. Women have stronger negative associations with math, and the more strongly a woman associated herself with the female gender identity, the more negative her association with math is.&lt;ref&gt;Math = male, me = female, therefore math ≠ me. Nosek, B. A., Banaji, M. R., &amp; Greenwald, A. G. (2002)" ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'' 83(1), 44-59.&lt;/ref&gt; This stereotype has been found in American children in as early as second grade.&lt;ref&gt;Math–gender stereotypes in elementary school children. Cvencek, D., Meltzoff, A. N., &amp; Greenwald, A. G. (2011)" ''Child Development'' 82, 766–779. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1467‐8624.2010.01529.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same was tested with Singaporean children, and it was found that the strength of their math-gender stereotype and their gender identity predicted their association between the self and math.&lt;ref&gt;Cognitive consistency and math–gender stereotypes in Singaporean children. Cvencek, D., Meltzoff, A. N., &amp; Kapur, M. (2014)" ''Journal of Experimental Child Psychology'' 117, 73–91. {{DOI|10.1016/j.jecp.2013.07.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that this stereotype also reflects performance in math. A study was done on the worldwide scale and it was found that the strength of this math-gender stereotype in varying countries correlates with 8th graders' scores on the [[TIMSS]], a standardized math and science achievement test that is given worldwide. The results were controlled for general gender inequality and still came out significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nosek | first1 = B. A. | last2 = Smyth | first2 = F.

Throughout the 20th century women in the United States saw a dramatic shift in social and professional aspirations and norms. Following the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|Women’s Suffrage Movement]] of the late 19th century, which resulted in the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] allowing women to vote, and in combination with conflicts in Europe, [[World War I|WWI]] and [[World War II|WWII]], women found themselves shifted into the industrial workforce. During this time, women were expected to take up industrial jobs and support the troops abroad through the means of domestic industry. Moving from “homemakers” and “caregivers”, women were now factory workers and “bread winners” for the family.

However, after the war, men returned to the States and women, again, saw a shift in social and professional dynamics. With the reuniting of the nuclear family, the ideals of American [[Suburb]]ia boomed. Throughout the 1950s and '60s, middle-class families moved in droves from urban living into newly developed single-family homes on former farm land just outside of major cities. Thus established what many modern critics describe as the “private sphere.”&lt;ref&gt;Deborah L. Rotman, "Separate Spheres? Beyond the Dichotomies of Domesticity", Current Anthology, Vol. 47, No. 2 (August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Though frequently sold and idealized as “perfect living”,&lt;ref&gt;Dan W. Dodson, Suburbanism and Education, Journal of Educational Sociology 32, 1 (Sep., 1958)&lt;/ref&gt; many women had difficulty adjusting to the new “private sphere.” Writer [[Betty Friedan]] described this discontent as “[[The Feminine Mystique|the feminine mystique]].” The “mystique” was derived from women equipped with the knowledge, skills, and aspirations of the workforce, the “public sphere”, who felt compelled whether socially or morally to devote themselves to the home and family.&lt;ref&gt;Friedan, Betty. "The Feminine Mystique". New York:W.W. Norton, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

One major concern of Feminism is that women occupy lower-ranking job positions than men, and do most of the housekeeping work.&lt;ref name="Gender differences in perceptions of household labor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-18658547.html|title=Gender differences in perceptions of household labor|accessdate=2009-10-23|publisher=The Journal of Psychology|date=July 1, 1996|author=Kiger, Kiger; Riley, Pamela J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent (October 2009) report from the Center for American Progress, "The Shriver Report: A Woman's Nation Changes Everything" tells us that women now make up 48% of the US workforce and "mothers are breadwinners or co-breadwinners in a majority of families" (63.3%, see figure 2, page 19 of the Executive Summary of The Shriver Report).&lt;ref name="The Shriver Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/10/womans_nation.html/#executive_summary|title=The Shriver Report: A Woman's Nation Changes Everything|accessdate=2009-10-23|publisher=Center for American Progress|date=October 19, 2009|author=Maria Shriver and the Center for American Progress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Louise Weiss.jpg|thumb|right|[[Louise Weiss]] along with other Parisian [[suffragette]]s in 1935. The newspaper headline reads "The Frenchwoman Must Vote."]]
Another recent article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' indicates that young women today are closing the pay gap. Luisita Lopez Torregrosa has noted, "Women are ahead of men in education (last year, 55 percent of U.S. college graduates were female). And a study shows that in most U.S. cities, single, childless women under 30 are making an average of 8 percent more money than their male counterparts, with Atlanta and Miami in the lead at 20 percent.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Torregrosa|first=Luisita|title=They Call It the Reverse Gender Gap|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/14/us/14iht-letter14.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=30 November 2012|date=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this study concerned American cities, a global trend is developing, and has now been termed "the reverse gender gap."

Feminist theory generally defines gender as a social construct that includes ideologies governing feminine/masculine (female/male) appearances, actions, and behaviors. An example of these gender roles would be that males were supposed to be the educated breadwinners of the family, and occupiers of the public sphere whereas, the female’s duty was to be a homemaker, take care of her husband and children, and occupy the private sphere. According to contemporary gender role ideology, gender roles have been and still are constantly changing. This can be seen in [[Londa Schiebinger]]'s ''Has Feminism Changed Science'' in which she states that, "Gendered characteristics - typically masculine or feminine behaviors, interests, or values-are not innate, nor are they arbitrary. They are formed by historical circumstances. They can also change with historical circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;''Has Feminism Changed Science?'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press 2001, ISBN 978-0-674-00544-0&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of the contemporary definition of gender was depicted in [[Sally Shuttleworth]]’s ''Female Circulation'' in which the, “abasement of the woman, reducing her from an active participant in the labor market to the passive bodily existence to be controlled by male expertise is indicative of the ways in which the ideological deployment of gender roles operated to facilitate and sustain the changing structure of familial and market relations in Victorian England.”&lt;ref&gt;Shuttleworth, Sally. "Female Circulation: Medical Discourse and Popular Advertising in the Mid-Victorian Era." Body/Politics: Women and the Discourses of Science. Eds. Mary Jacobus, Evelyn Fox Keller and Sally Shuttleworth. New York: Routledge, 1990. 47–70&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, this shows what it meant to grow up into the roles (gender roles) of a female in Victorian England, which transitioned from being a homemaker to being a working woman and then back to being passive and inferior to males. In conclusion, gender roles in the contemporary sex gender model are socially constructed, always changing, and do not really exist since, they are ideologies that society constructs in order for various benefits at various times in history.

The men's rights movement (MRM) is a part of the larger [[men's movement]]. It branched off from the [[men's liberation movement]] in the early 1970s. The men's rights movement is made up of a variety of groups and individuals who are concerned about what they consider to be issues of male disadvantage, [[discrimination]] and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HgzFZ4o0qnMC&amp;pg=PA11 |page=11 |last=Gavanas |first=Anna |title=Fatherhood Politics in the United States: Masculinity, Sexuality, Race, and Marriage |publisher=University of Illinois Press |location= Urbana |year=2004 |isbn=0-252-02884-8 |quote=All these cases of perceived discrimination make up the men's rights view that men are considered, by government and society, to be more expendable than women.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BoydLongwood1996"&gt;{{cite book|title=Redeeming men: religion and masculinities|editors=Stephen Blake Boyd, W.

In Canada, a private members bill protecting the rights of freedom of gender expression and gender identity passed in the House of Commons on February 9, 2011. It amends the Canada Human Rights code to help protect gender-variant people from discrimination by including gender identity and expression in the list of prohibited grounds for discrimination, as well as including gender identity and expression in the description of identifiable group, so that offences deliberately against gender-variant people can be punished to a similar extent as a racial-based crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Docid=3906520&amp;file=4|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223035447/http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Docid=3906520&amp;file=4|archivedate=23 December 2010|deadurl=yes|title=Bill C-389}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill may or may not be passed by the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-notebook/transgendered-rights-bill-headed-for-defeat-in-tory-held-senate/article1902266/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | first=John | last=Ibbitson | title=Transgendered-rights bill headed for defeat in Tory-held Senate | date=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, when sexual orientation is discussed it is broken into the three categories of heterosexual, homosexual and bisexual. However, some argue that sexual orientation is better defined as a continuum with those three categories represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lindley|first=Lisa |author2=Katrina Walsemann |author3=Jarvis Carter|title=The Association of Sexual Orientation Measures With Young Adults' Health-Related Outcomes|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=June 2012|volume=102|issue=6|pages=1177–1178|doi=10.2105/ajph.2011.300262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual orientation is developed based on the three components of sexual identity, sexual behavior and sexual attraction &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Robert |author2=Paul McKinney |author3=Shannon Fox |author4=Carlos Garcia|title=Support for a Fluid-Continuum Model or Sexual Orientation: A Large-Scale Internet Study|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|date=20 November 2013|volume=59|pages=1356–1358|doi=10.1080/00918369.2012.724634|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each component is independent of the other disallowing conclusions to be drawn based solely on one dimension.

Gender identity and sexual orientation are two separate aspects of individual identity, although they are often mistakenly conflated in the media.&lt;ref name="GLAAD"&gt;Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.

Perhaps it is an attempt to reconcile this conflict that leads to a common assumption that one same-sex partner assumes a pseudo-male gender role and the other assumes a pseudo-female role. For a gay male relationship, this might lead to the assumption that the "wife" handled domestic chores, was the receptive sexual partner during sex, adopted effeminate mannerisms, and perhaps even dressed in women's clothing.&lt;ref&gt;Mager, D. (1985) Gay theories of gender role deviance. SubStance vol. 14 no. 1 pp. 32-48&lt;/ref&gt; This assumption is flawed, as many homosexual couples tend to have more equal roles, and the effeminate behavior of some gay men is usually not adopted consciously, and is often more subtle.&lt;ref name=Dwyer&gt;{{cite book|last=Dwyer |first=D.|title=Interpersonal Relationships [e-book]|year=2000|publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-203-01971-7|page=104|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohabitating same-sex partners are typically egalitarian when they assign domestic chores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cherlin|first=Andrew|title=Public and Private Families, an introduction|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though sometimes these couples assign traditional female responsibilities to one partner and traditional male responsibilities to the other, generally same-sex [[domestic partnership|domestic partners]] challenge traditional gender roles in their division of household responsibilities, and gender roles within homosexual relationships are flexible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crook|first=Robert|title=Our Sexuality|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, cleaning and cooking, traditionally both female responsibilities, might be assigned to different people.  Carrington observed the daily home lives of 52 gay and lesbian couples and found that the length of the work week and level of earning power substantially affected the assignment of housework, regardless of gender or sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Carrington, C.

Like Andersen and Hill Collins (1998: 4) in their discussion of what they refer to as a 'matrix of domination,' we too conceive that class, race, and gender represent "multiple, interlocking levels of domination that stem from the societal configurations of these structural relationships.
