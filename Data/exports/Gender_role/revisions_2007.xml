[[Image:Bagpipe performer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Bagpipes|bagpiper]] in [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[military]] clan-[[uniform]]. In many parts of the [[Western world|West]], wearing a [[skirt]] may be unacceptable as part of a male [[gender]] role, but in [[Scotland]] men have traditionally worn a [[kilt]], which is similar.]]

A '''gender role''' is a set of perceived behavioral [[norm]]s associated particularly with males or females, in a given social group or system. It can be a form of [[division of labour]] by [[gender]]. It is a focus of analysis in the [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]]. [[Gender]] is one component of the [[gender]]/[[sex]] system, which refers to "The set of arrangements by which a [[society]] transforms biological sexuality into products of human activity, and in which these transformed needs are satisfied" (Reiter 1975: 159). All societies, to a certain effect, have a gender/sex system, although the components and workings of this system vary markedly from society to society.

Researchers recognize that the concrete behavior of individuals is a consequence of both socially enforced rules and values, and individual disposition, whether genetic, unconscious, or conscious. Some researchers emphasize the objective social system and others emphasize subjective orientations and dispositions.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

Creativity may cause the rules and values to change over time. Cultures and societies are dynamic and ever changing, but there has been extensive debate as to how, and how fast, they may change. Such debates are especially contentious when they involve the gender/sex system, as people have widely differing views about how much gender depends on biological sex.

== Talcott Parsons' views of gender roles ==
Working in the [[United States]], [[Talcott Parsons]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arte-tv.com Franco-German TV Station ARTE], Karambolage, August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; developed a model of the [[nuclear family]] in 1955. (At that place and time, the [[nuclear family]] was considered to be the prevalent family structure.) It compared a strictly traditional view of gender roles (from an industrial-age American perspective) to a more liberal view.

Parsons believed that the feminine role was an '''''expressive''''' one, whereas the masculine role, in his view, was '''''instrumental'''''. He believed that expressive activities of the woman fulfill 'internal' functions, for example to strengthen the ties between members of the family. The man, on the other hand, performed the 'external' functions of a family, such as providing monetary support.

'''The Parsons model''' was used to contrast and illustrate extreme positions on gender roles. Model A describes total separation of male and female roles, while Model B describes the complete dissolution of barriers between gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;Brockhaus: Enzyklopädie der Psychologie, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; (The examples are based on the context of the culture and [[infrastructure]] of the United States.)

However, these extreme positions are rarely found in reality; actual behavior of individuals is usually somewhere between these poles. The most common 'model' followed in real life in the United States and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] is the 'model of double burden' (See [[#Gender roles and feminism|Gender roles and feminism]] below).{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

According to the interactionist approach, roles (including gender roles) are not fixed, but are constantly negotiated between individuals. In North America and southern South America, this is the most common approach among families whose business is [[agriculture]].

Gender roles can influence all kinds of behavior, such as choice of clothing, choice of work and personal relationships; E.g., parental status (See also [[Sociology of fatherhood]]).

==Gender roles and socialization==
The [[process]] through which the [[individual]] learns and accepts [[roles]] is called [[socialization]]. Socialization works by encouraging wanted and discouraging unwanted [[behavior]]. These sanctions by [[Agency of socialization|agencies of socialization]] such as the [[family]], [[schools]], and the communication medium make it clear to the [[child]] what behavioral [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] the child is expected to follow. The examples of the child's parents, siblings and teachers are typically followed. Mostly, accepted behavior is not produced by outright [[reform]]ing coercion from an accepted [[social system]]. In some other cases, various forms of coercion have been used to acquire a desired response or function.

In the majority of traditional and developmental social systems, an individual has a choice as to what they should or should not [[Conformity (psychology)|conform]] to as a representative of the socialization process. In this voluntary process, the consequences can be beneficial or negative, minor or severe depending on the coping strategies of the individual, as well as the extent to which they must modify their natural behavior to conform to society's accepted behavioral standards.
Typical encouragements and expectations of gender role behavior are not as a powerful difference and reforming [[social trait]] to a century ago. Such developments and traditional refineries are still a socialization process to and within [[family values]], [[peer pressure]]s, at the [[employment]] centers and in every social system communication medium.

Still, once someone has accepted certain gender roles and [[gender differences]] as expected socialized behavioral norm, their [[behavior trait]]s become part of their perceived [[responsibilities]]. Influential roles in gender relationships on a personal and social level to the individual's own socializing role or [[self-concept]]. Sanctions to unwanted behavior and role conflict can be stressful.

===Gender roles with homogenization vs. ethnoconvergence difference===
[[Image:LouisXVchild.jpg|thumb|left|Changing norms of socialization: [[Louis XV]] in [[1712]], wearing the customary clothes of [[breeching|unbreeched]] boys, would be considered "[[Cross-dressing|cross-dressed]]" in the 21st century.]]

It is claimed that even in monolingual, industrial societies like urban North America, some individuals do cling to a "modernized" primordial identity, apart from others and with this a more diverse gender role is recognitized or developed. Some intellectuals, such as [[Michael Ignatieff]], argue that convergence of a general culture does not directly entail a similar convergence in [[ethnic]], social and self identities. This can become evident in social situations, where people divide into separate groups by gender roles and cultural alignments, despite being of an identical ''"super-ethnicity"'', such as [[nationality]].

Within each smaller ethnicity, individuals may tend to see it perfectly justified to assimilate with other cultures including sexuality and some others view assimilation as wrong and incorrect for their culture or institution. This common theme, representing dualist opinions of ethnoconvergence itself, within a single ethnic or common [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s groups is often manifested in issues of sexual partners and [[matrimony]], employment preferences, etc. These varied opinions of ethnoconvergence represent themselves in a spectrum; [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]], [[homogenization]], [[acculturation]], gender identities and cultural [[compromise]] are commonly used terms for ethnoconvegence which flavor the issues to a bias.

Often it's in a secular, multi-ethnic environment that cultural concerns are both minimalized and exacerbated; Ethnic prides are boasted, hierarchy is created ("center" culture versus "periphery") but on the other hand, they will still share a common "culture", and common language and behaviors. Often the elderly, more conservative-in-association of a clan, tend to reject cross-cultural associations, and participate in ethnically similar community-oriented activities. [[Xenophobia|Xenophobes]] tend to think of cross-cultural contact as a component of gender and [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] and see this as terrible.{{Views needing attribution|date=May 2007}}

==Biology==
Gender roles have long been a staple of the "[[nature versus nurture]]" debate. Traditional theories of gender usually assume that one's gender identity, and hence one's gender role, is a natural given. For example, it is often claimed in Western and other societies that women are naturally more fit to look after children. {{Views needing attribution|date=May 2007}} The idea that differences in gender roles originate in differences in biology has found support in parts of the scientific community. 19th-century [[anthropology]] sometimes used descriptions of the imagined life of [[paleolithic]] [[hunter-gatherer]] societies for evolutionary explanations for gender differences. For example, those accounts maintain that the need to take care of offspring may have limited the females' freedom to hunt and assume positions of power.

More recently, [[sociobiology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]] have explained those differences in social roles by treating them as [[adaptation]]s. {{Views needing attribution|date=May 2007}}This approach, too, is considered controversial.

Due to the influence of (among others) [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s feminist works and [[Michel Foucault]]'s reflections on sexuality, the idea that [[gender]] was unrelated to sex gained ground during the [[1980s|1980's]], especially in sociology and cultural anthropology. This view claims that a person could therefore be born with male genitals but still be of feminine gender. In 1987, [[R.W. Connell]] did extensive research on whether there are any connections between biology and gender role&lt;ref&gt;Connell, Robert William: Gender and Power, Cambridge: University Press 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; and concluded that there were none. Most scientists reject Connell's research because concrete evidence exists proving the effect of hormones on behavior. However, hormone levels vary, and disorders can cause an intersex status. The debate continues to rage on. [[Simon Baron-Cohen]], a Cambridge Univ. professor of psychology and psychiatry, has said that "the female brain is predominantly hard-wired for empathy, while the male brain is predominantly hard-wired for understanding and building systems." Some researchers, such as [[Bruce Lipton]], believe that [[neural network|neural synapses]] in early childhood are formed due to the environment of the child, so if parents were to treat the child as to his or her assigned gender, then the brain would develop for that gender role and thus would be "hard-wired".&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Lipton Ph. D: [http://www.brucelipton.com/article/conscious-parenting Conscious Parenting], May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Real world cases such as [[David Reimer]], on the other hand, show that raising a child in a cross-sex role does not cause the child to necessarily adapt to that role.

[[Sandra Bem|Dr. Sandra Lipsitz Bem]] is a psychologist who developed the gender schema theory to explain how individuals come to use gender as an organizing category in all aspects of their life.  It is based on the combination of aspects of the [[Social cognitivism|social learning theory]] and the [[Theory of cognitive development|cognitive-development theory]] of sex role acquisition.  In 1971, she created the Bem Sex Role Inventory to measure how well you fit into your traditional gender role by characterizing your personality as masculine, feminine, androgynous, or undifferentiated.  She believed that through gender-schematic processing, a person spontaneously sorts attributes and behaviors into masculine and feminine categories.  Therefore, an individual processes information and regulate their behavior based on whatever definitions of femininity and masculinity their culture provides.&lt;ref&gt;Bem,S.L.(1981). Gender schema theory:A cognitive account of sex typing. ''Psychological Review'',88,354-364&lt;/ref&gt;

The current trend in Western societies toward men and women sharing similar occupations, responsibilities and jobs suggests that the sex one is born with does not directly determine one's abilities. {{Views needing attribution|date=May 2007}}While there are differences in average capabilities of various kinds (E.g., physical strength) between the sexes, the capabilities of some members of one sex will fall within the range of capabilities needed for tasks conventionally assigned to the other sex.

==Changing roles==
{{cquote|Girls can wear jeans&lt;br&gt;And cut their hair short&lt;br&gt;Wear shirts and boots&lt;br&gt;'Cause it's okay to be a boy&lt;br&gt;But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading&lt;br&gt;'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading&lt;br&gt;But secretly you'd love to know what it's like&lt;br&gt;Wouldn't you&lt;br&gt;What it feels like for a girl|20px|20px|an excerpt from ''[[The Cement Garden]]'' which appears in the Madonna song, "[[What It Feels Like for a Girl]]" }}
A person's gender role is composed of several elements and can be expressed through clothing, behaviour, choice of work, personal relationships and other factors. These elements are not concrete and have evolved through time (for example women's trousers).

Gender roles were traditionally divided into strictly feminine and masculine gender roles, though these roles have diversified today into many different acceptable male or female gender roles. However, gender role norms for women and men can vary significantly from one country or [[culture]] to another, even within a country or culture. 

Gender role can vary according to the social group to which a person belongs or the subculture with which he or she identifies [[cultural identity]]. Historically, for example, eunuchs had a different gender role because their biology was changed.

[[Image:AssemblyOfQuakers.jpg|400px|thumb|left|A woman publicly witnessing at a Quaker meeting seemed an extraordinary feature of the Religious Society of Friends, worth recording for a wider public. Engraving by Bernard Picart, ''ca'' 1723.]]

'''[[Androgyny]]''', a term denoting the display of both male and female behaviour, also exists. Many terms have been developed to portray sets of behaviors arising in this context. The masculine gender role in the West has become more malleable since the 1950s. One example is the "sensitive new age guy", which could be described as a traditional male gender role with a more typically "female" empathy and associated emotional responses. Another is the [[metrosexual]], a male who adopts or claims to be born with similarly "female" grooming habits. Some have argued that such new roles are merely rebelling against tradition more so than forming a distinct role. However, traditions regarding male and female appearance have never been concrete, and men in other eras have been equally interested with their appearance. The popular conceptualization of homosexual men, which has become more accepted in recent decades, has traditionally been more androgynous or effeminate, though in actuality homosexual men can also be masculine and even exhibit machismo characteristics. One could argue that since many homosexual men and women fall into one gender role or another or are androgynous, that gender roles are not strictly determined by a person's physical sex. Whether or not this phenomenon is due to social or biological reasons is debated. Many homosexual people find the traditional gender roles to be very restrictive, especially during childhood. Also, the phenomenon of [[intersex]] people, which has become more publicly accepted, has caused much debate on the subject of gender roles. Many intersexual people identify with the opposite sex, while others are more androgynous. Some see this as a threat to traditional gender roles, while others see it as a sign that these roles are a social construct, and that a change in gender roles will be liberating.

According to sociology research, traditional feminine gender roles have become less relevant and hollower in Western societies since industrialization started. For example, the cliché that women do not follow a career is obsolete in many Western societies. On the other hand, in the media there are attempts to portray women who adopt an extremely classical role as a subculture. {{Views needing attribution|date=May 2007}}Women take on many roles that were traditionally reserved for men, as well as behaviors and fashions, which may cause pressure on many men to be more masculine and thus confined within an even smaller gender role, while other men react against this pressure. For example, men's fashions have become more restrictive than in other eras, while women's fashions have become more broad.
One consequence of social unrest during the Vietnam War era was that men began to let their hair grow to a length that had previously (within recent history) been considered appropriate only for women. Somewhat earlier, women had begun to cut their hair to lengths previously considered appropriate only to men.

Some famous people known for their androgynous appearances in the 20th century include [[Brett Anderson]], [[Gladys Bentley]], [[David Bowie]], [[Pete Burns]], [[Boy George]], [[Norman Iceberg]], [[k.d. lang]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[Jaye Davidson]], [[Marilyn Manson (musician)]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Mylène Farmer]], [[Gackt]], [[Mana (musician)]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Marc Bolan]], [[Brian Molko]], [[Julia Sweeney]] (as [[Pat (fictional character)]]), [[Genesis P-Orridge]], [[Prince]] and [[Kristen McMenamy]].

== Culture and gender roles ==
[[Image:WomanFactory1940s.jpg|thumb|right|300px|During [[World War II]], women filled job positions some of which would otherwise be male dominated.]]
Ideas of appropriate behavior according to gender vary among cultures and era, although some aspects receive more widespread attention than others. An interesting case is described by [[R.W. Connell]] in ''[[Men, Masculinities and Feminism]]'':

:"There are cultures where it has been normal, not exceptional, for men to have homosexual relations. There have been periods in 'Western' history when the modern convention that men suppress displays of emotion did not apply at all, when men were demonstrative about their feeling for their friends. Mateship in the Australian outback last century is a case in point."

Other aspects, however, may differ markedly with time and place. In pre-industrial [[Europe]], for example, the practice of [[medical science|medicine]] (Other than midwifery) was generally seen as a male prerogative. However, in [[Russia]], health care was more often seen as a feminine [[role]]. The results of these views can still be seen in modern society, where European medicine is most often practiced by men, while the majority of Russian doctors are women.

In many other cases, the elements of convention or tradition seem to play a dominant role in deciding which occupations fit in with which gender roles. In the United States, physicians have traditionally been men, and the few people who defied that expectation received a special job description: "woman doctor". Similarly, there are special terms like "male nurse", "woman lawyer", "lady barber", "male secretary," etc. But in China and the former Soviet Union countries, medical doctors are predominantly women, and in Germany and Taiwan it is very common for all of the barbers in a barber shop to be women. Also, throughout history, some jobs that have been typically male or female have switched genders. For example, clerical jobs. Clerical jobs used to be considered a man's job, but when several women began filling men's job positions due to World War II, clerical jobs quickly became dominated by women. It became more feminized, and women workers became known as "typewriters" or "secretaries". There are many other jobs that have switched gender roles, and many jobs are continually evolving as far as being dominated by women or men.

In Western society, people whose gender appears masculine and whose inferred and/or verified external genitalia are male are often criticized and ridiculed for exhibiting what the society regards as a woman's gender role{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. For instance, someone with a masculine voice, a five o'clock shadow (or a fuller [[beard]]), an [[Adam's apple]], etc., wearing a woman's dress and high heels, carrying a purse, etc., would most likely draw ridicule or other unfriendly attention in ordinary social contexts (the stage and screen excepted &lt;ref name="Top Grossing Cross Dressing / Gender Bending Movies at the Box Office"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=crossdressing.htm|title=Cross Dressing / Gender Bending Movies|accessdate = 2006-11-08|publisher=Box Office Mojo, LLC|year=1998|author=Box Office Mojo, LLC|format=HTML}}&lt;/ref&gt;). It is seen by some in that society that such a gender role for a man is not acceptable.&lt;ref name="How do transgender people suffer from discrimination?"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/Content/NavigationMenu/HRC/Get_Informed/Issues/Transgender_Issues1/Transgender_Basics/Transgender_Basics.htm|title=Transgender Basics|accessdate = 2006-11-08|publisher=The Human Rights Campaign|year=2004|author=The Human Rights Campaign|format=HTML}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, and other societies, impose expectations on the behaviour of the members of society, and specifically on the gender roles of individuals, resulting in [[prescriptions regarding gender roles]].

It should be noted that some societies are comparatively rigid in their expectations, and other societies are comparatively permissive. Some of the gender signals that form part of a gender role and indicate one's gender identity to others are quite obvious, and others are so subtle that they are transmitted and received out of ordinary conscious awareness.

== Transgendered and intersexed people ==
As long as a person's perceived physiological sex is consistent with that person's gender identity, the gender role of a person is so much a matter of course in a stable society that people rarely even think of it. Only in cases where, for whatever reason, an individual has a gender role that is inconsistent with his or her sex will the matter draw attention.

Not entertaining, but usually highly problematic, however, are cases wherein the external [[genitalia]] of a person, that person's perceived gender identity, and/or that person's gender role are not consistent. People naturally, but too easily, assume that if a person has a [[penis]], [[scrotum]], etc., then that person is [[chromosome|chromosomally]] male (I.e., that person has one [[X chromosome]] and one [[Y chromosome]]), and that the person, in introspection, feels like a male. 

In one example, a person may have a penis and scrotum, but may be a female (With XX chromosomal sexual identity and with normal female sexual organs internally). When that person reaches puberty, "his" breasts may enlarge to ordinary female proportions, and "he" may begin to menstruate, passing menstrual blood through "his" penis.&lt;ref name="crown"&gt;Ali P. Crown: [http://www.emory.edu/EMORY_REPORT/erarchive/1996/March/ERmar.4/3_4_96first_person.html Choice is the Power of Feminism], Emory Report, vol. 48, no. 24&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, this person may have always accepted a gender identity that is consistent with "his" external genitalia '''or''' with "her" internal genitalia. When the true sex of the individual becomes revealed at puberty, the individual and/or the community will be forced to reconsider what gender role is to be considered appropriate. Biological conditions that cause a person's physiological sex to be not easily determined are collectively known as intersex.

Another example to consider is [[transgender]] people, who mix gender roles to form a personally comfortable androgynous combination or transcend the scheme of gender roles completely, regardless of their physiological sex . Transgender people can also be physically androgynous or identify as androgynous. [[Transsexual]]ism also exists, where a person who is born as one sex and is brought up in that sex, but has [[gender identity]] of the opposite sex and wishes to live as that sex (but does not necessarily wish to adopt that particular gender role, depending upon whether the person in question believes that gender roles are innate).

When we consider these more unusual products of nature's inventiveness, the simple picture that we saw originally, in which there was a high degree of consistency among external genitalia, gender identity, and gender role, then dissolves into a kind of jigsaw puzzle that is difficult to put together correctly. The extra parts of this jigsaw puzzle fall into two closely related categories, [[atypical gender identities]] and [[atypical gender role]]s.

In Western society, there is a growing acceptance of [[intersex]]ed and [[transgender]]ed people. However, there are some who do not accept these people and may react violently and persecute them: this kind of negative value judgment is sometimes known as [[transphobia]].

Nevertheless, such cases of mismatch between a person's physiology, identity and role are rare. A large majority of people have matching genitalia and gender identities. For many people their gender role is commensurate with their genitalia.

== Gender roles and feminism ==
{{main|Feminism}}
Most [[feminist]]s argue that traditional gender roles are oppressive for women. They believe that the female gender role was constructed as an opposite to an ideal male role, and helps to perpetuate patriarchy. &lt;!--Feminists, possibly from a [[Radical feminist]] viewpoint, also note that a [[patriarchal]] society implies a gender role for women that help to perpetuate this patriarchy.--&gt;

For approximately the last 100 years women have been fighting for the same rights as men (especially around the turn from 19th to 20th century with the struggle for women's [[suffrage]] and in the 1960s with [[second-wave feminism]] and [[radical feminism]]) and were able to make changes to the traditionally accepted feminine gender role. However, most feminists today say there is still work to be done.

Numerous studies and statistics show that even though the situation for women has improved during the last century, [[discrimination]] is still widespread: Women earn a smaller percentage of aggregate income than men, occupy lower-ranking job positions than men and do most of the housekeeping work{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

Furthermore, there has been a perception of Western culture, in recent times, that the female gender role is dichotomized into either being a "stay at home-mother" or a "career woman"{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. In reality, women usually face a [[double burden]]: The need to balance job and child care deprives women of spare time. Whereas the majority of men with university educations have a career as well as a family, only 50 percent of academic women have children. The double burden problem was introduced to scientific theory in 1956 by Myrdal and Klein in their work "Women's two roles: Home and work," published in London.

When feminism became a conspicuous protest movement in the 60's, critics often argued that women who wanted to follow a traditional role would be discriminated against in the future and forced to join the workforce. This has not proven true as such: although some women, especially [[single parent]]s are denied this choice due to economic necessity, there is little or no discrimination against women who remain in traditional roles.{{Fact|date=May 2007}} At the beginning of the 21st century women who choose to live in the classical role of the "stay at home-mother" are acceptable to Western society. There is not complete tolerance of all female gender roles - there is some lasting prejudice and discrimination&lt;!--Expand the forms of prejudice and discrimination please--&gt; against those who choose to adhere to traditional female gender roles (sometimes termed being [[femme]] or a "[[girly girl]]"){{Fact|date=February 2007}}, despite feminism, in theory, not being about the choices made but the freedom to make that choice&lt;!--maybe discuss how despite the stereotype, girlyness and prissyness are not always synonymous--&gt;.&lt;ref name="crown" /&gt; Women who choose to pursue careers and higher education are also similarly stigmatized, and often accused of "trying to become a man" and "abandoning their children" if they pursue anything outside the role of mother, mistress, and maid{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

==Terminology==
Note that many people consider some or all of the following terms to have negative [[connotation]]s.
* A male adopting (or who is perceived as adopting) a female gender role might be described as [[effeminate]], ''[[fop]]pish'', or [[sissy]]. Even more [[pejorative]] terms include ''mollycoddle'', [[milquetoast]], ''milksop'', ''sop'', ''mamma's boy'', and ''namby-pamby''.
* A female adopting (or who is perceived as adopting) a male role might be described as [[butch and femme|butch]], as a [[tomboy]], or as a ''mannish woman''. More pejorative terms include ''amazon'' (See [[amazon feminism]]).

== Sexual orientation and gender roles ==
{{wikinews|RuPaul speaks about society and the state of drag as performance art}}
Traditional gender roles include male attraction to females, and vice versa. [[Gay]], [[lesbian]] and [[bisexuality|bisexual]] people, among others, usually don't conform to these expectations. An active conflict over the cultural acceptability of non-[[heterosexuality]] rages worldwide. (See [[Societal attitudes towards homosexuality]].) The belief or assumption that [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] relationships and acts are "normal" is described — largely by the opponents of this viewpoint — as [[heterosexism]] or in [[queer theory]], [[heteronormativity]].

Perhaps it is an attempt to reconcile this conflict that leads to a common assumption that one same-sex partner assumes a pseudo-male gender role and the other assumes a pseudo-female role. For a gay male relationship, this might lead to the assumption that the "wife" handled domestic chores, was the receptive sexual partner in anal sex, adopted effeminate mannerisms, and perhaps even dressed in women's clothing. This assumption is flawed, as many homosexual couples tend to have more equal roles, and the effeminate behavior of some gay men is usually not adopted consciously, and is often more subtle. Feminine or masculine behaviors in some homosexual people might be a product of the socialization process, adopted unconsciously due to stronger identification with the opposite sex during development. The role of both this process and the role of biology is debated. The existence of these separate identities (dominant masculine vs more passive feminine), where present, can establish the dynamics of the relationship, according to the heterosexual patterns; this is not always the case, especially in relationships with less clearly defined sexual/identity roles. A related assumption is that all [[Androphilia|androphilic]] people, including gay men, should or do adopt feminine mannerisms and other gender-role elements, and that all [[Gynophilia|gynophilic]] people, including lesbians, should or do adopt masculine mannerisms and other gender-role elements; it is unclear how [[bisexuality]] fits into this framework, but it can be assumed they have a dragging towards both gender roles as they do in sexuality, towards both sexes. However, this idea is based on generalizations of homosexual people, which tend to be biased, as feminine gays and masculine lesbians are more widely visible than masculine gays or feminine lesbians.

Same-sex [[domestic partnership|domestic partners]] also challenge traditional gender roles because it is impossible to divide up household responsibilities along gender lines if both partners attempt to fill the same gender role. Like all live-in couples, same-sex partners usually do come to some arrangement with regard to household responsibilities. Sometimes these arrangements do assign traditional female responsibilities to one partner and traditional male responsibilities to the other, but non-traditional divisions of labor are also quite common. For instance, cleaning and cooking, traditionally both female responsibilities, might be assigned to different people. Some people do adopt the sexual role of [[Bottom (sex)|bottom]] or [[Top (sex)|top]], due to their own sexual identity or for convenience; but this is not universal, and does not necessarily correspond to assignment of household responsibilities.

[[Cross-dressing]] is also quite common in gay and lesbian culture, but it is usually restricted to festive occasions, though there are people of all sexual orientations who routinely engage in various types of cross-dressing, either as a fashion statement or for entertainment. Distinctive styles of dress, however, are commonly seen in gay and lesbian circles. These fashions sometimes emulate the traditional styles of the opposite gender (For example, lesbians who wear t-shirts and boots instead of skirts and dresses, or gay men who wear clothing with traditionally feminine elements, including displays of jewelry or coloration), but others do not. Fashion choices also do not necessarily align with other elements of gender identity. Some fashion and behavioral elements in gay and lesbian culture are novel, and do not really correspond to any traditional gender roles. For example, the popularity of rainbow jewelry, or the gay techno/dance music subculture. In addition to the stereotypically effeminate one, another significant gay male subculture is [[homomasculinity]], emphasizing certain traditionally masculine or hypermasculine traits. (See [[Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures]].) These may be natural traits for an individual, or they may be adopted to conform to mainstream culture or to distance oneself from the more effeminate gays, as masculinity is often seen as a positive trait among gay men. {{Views needing attribution|date=May 2007}} . A quick look through gay personals websites, such as Gaydar, will reveal that many gay men's personals are discouraging effeminate men from replying to their ad. (Fat, effeminate or bald, please do not disturb).

The term ''dyke'', commonly used to mean ''lesbian'', sometimes carries associations of a butch or masculine identity, and the variant ''bulldyke'' certainly does. Other gender-role-charged lesbian terms include [[lipstick lesbian]], [[Soft butch|chapstick lesbian]], and [[Stone Femme]]. "Butch," "femme," and novel elements are also seen in various lesbian subcultures.

External social pressures may lead some people to adopt a persona which is perceived as more appropriate for a heterosexual (For instance, in an intolerant work environment) or homosexual (for instance, in a same-sex dating environment), while maintaining a somewhat different identity in other, more private circumstances. The acceptance of new gender roles in [[Western world|Western societies]], however, is rising.&lt;ref&gt;According to John Money, in the case of androgen-induced transsexual status, "The clitoris becomes hypertrophied so as to become a penile clitoris with incomplete fusion and a urogenital sinus, or, if fusion is complete, a penis with urethra and an empty scrotum" (''Gay, Straight, and In-Between'', p. 31). At ovarian puberty, "menstruation through the penis" begins (op. cit., p. 32). In the case of the adrenogenital syndrome, hormonal treatment could bring about "breast growth and menstruation through the penis" (op. cit., p. 34). In one case an individual was born with a fully formed penis and empty scrotum. At the age of puberty that person's own physician provided treatment with cortisol. "His breasts developed and heralded the approach of first menstruation, through the penis".&lt;/ref&gt; However, during childhood and adolescence, gender identities which differ from the norm are often the cause of ridicule and ostracism, which often results in psychological problems. Some are able to disguise their differences, but others are not. Even though much of society has become more tolerant, gender roles are still very prevalent in the emotionally charged world of children and teenagers, which makes life very difficult for those who differ from the established norms.

===The role of ideology in the enculturation of gender roles===
{{Disputed-section}}

High levels of agreement on the characteristics different cultures to males and females reflects consensus in gender role ideology. Most egalitarian roles found in Netherlands, Germany, Finland. Most traditional roles found in Nigeria, Pakistan, and India. Men and women cross-culturally rate the ideal self as more masculine than their self. American difference on spatial reasoning between males and females does not apply in all cultures. Not the Inuit culture of Canada. Male superiority is found in tight, sedentary, agriculturally based, while females are superior in cultures that are loose, nomadic, and hunter-gathering based. US females are more conforming to others than are males. Males are more aggressive in all cultures for which data exists. Related to but not solely determined by age or hormones. Male aggression may be a "gender marking" issue breaking away from the instruction of the mother during adolescence.  Asian-American females adhere to traditional gender roles. Males are aloof, unemotional, authoritative. Inside the family, women have high control of decisions. Hispanic Americans males inhabit machismo. Acculturation is creeping into these families, however. Native American gender roles depend on cultural history of the tribe. &lt;ref&gt;C. André Christie-Mizell.

==Gender roles in prison==
{{Disputed-section}}
Gender roles in male prisons go further than the "[[Don't drop the soap]]"-joke. The truth is that some prisoners, either by choice or by force, take on strict 'female roles' according to prison set guidelines. For instance, a 'female' in prison is seen as timid, submissive, passive, and a means of sexual pleasure. When entering the prison environment some inmates "turn out" on their own free will, meaning they actively pursue the 'female role' in prison to gain some form of social power and/or prestige. Other, unlucky inmates, are forced to partake in 'female role' activities through coercion; the most common means being physical abuse. The inmates that are forced to "turn out" are commonly referred to as "punks". Other terms used to describe 'female' inmates are "girls", "kids", and "gumps". Some of the labels may be used as a means of describing one's ascribed status. For example, a "kid" is one that is usually dominated by their owner, or "daddy". The "daddy" is usually one with a high social status and prestige within the prison (E.g. gang leader). The "female" gender role is constructed through the mirror image of what the inmates perceive as a male. For instance, inmates view men as having strength, power, prestige, and an unyielding personality. However, the inmates don't refer to the female guards, who have power and prestige over the inmates, as males. The female guards are commonly referred to as "dykes", "ditch lickers", and lesbians. These roles are also assumed in female prisons.&lt;ref name="coggeshall"&gt;John M. Coggeshall: ''The Best of Anthropology Today: ‘Ladies’ Behind Bars: A Liminal Gender as Cultural Mirror''&lt;/ref&gt;

Women who enter prison society often ''voluntarily'' enter into lesbianism, as a means of protection from ''gangs'' or stronger females. In doing so, they will take on the [[submissive]] role to a [[dominant]] female in exchange for that dominating female keeping her safe. Those who do not enter voluntarily into lesbianism might at one time or another be group raped, to introduce them into that circle, and sometimes they will be referred to as ''sheep'', meaning anyone can have them. It is to avoid that status that most female inmates ''choose'' a mate, or allow themselves to be ''chosen'' as a mate, which can make them available to only a minimal number of partners during their incarceration, as opposed to a large number. So, in a sense, an inmate undergoes a "female role" in the prison system either by choice or by yielding to excessive coercion, and it is that yielding that terms the once male inmates as "females", and which identifies the stronger females in a female prison system as "males".&lt;ref name="coggeshall" /&gt;
