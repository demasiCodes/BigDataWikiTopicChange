The '''one-drop rule''' is a historical [[colloquial]] term in the United States for the social classification as [[Negro]] of individuals with any [[African]] ancestry; meaning any person with "one drop of Negro blood" was considered black. The principle of "invisible blackness" was an example of [[hypodescent]], the automatic assignment of children of a mixed union between different socioeconomic or ethnic groups to the group with the lower status.&lt;ref name=highered.mcgraw-hill&gt;Conrad P. Kottak, [http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072500506/student_view0/chapter5/faqs.html "What is hypodescent?"], ''Human Diversity and "Race"'', Cultural Anthropology, Online Learning, McGraw Hill, accessed 21 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although [[racial segregation]] was adopted legally by southern states of the former Confederacy in the late 19th century, legislators resisted defining race by law. In 1895 in South Carolina during discussion, [[George D. Tillman]] said, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...It is a scientific fact that there is not one full-blooded Caucasian on the floor of this convention. Every member has in him a certain mixture of… colored blood...It would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation, of scandal, horror, feud, and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote, perhaps obsolete trace of Negro blood. The doors would be open to scandal, malice, and greed..."&lt;ref name="courier"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The one-drop rule was not adopted as law until the 20th century: first in [[Tennessee]] in 1910 and in [[Virginia]] under the [[Racial Integrity Act]] of 1924 (following the passage of similar laws in several other states).

Before and during [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], interracial relationships formed. In the [[History of the United States (1789–1849)|antebellum]] years, free people of mixed race ([[free people of color]]) were considered legally white if individuals had up to one-eighth or one-quarter African ancestry (depending on the state).&lt;ref name=Rothman&gt;Joshua D. Rothman, ''Notorious in the Neighborhood: Sex and Families Across the Color Line in Virginia, 1787–1861'' (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina, 2003), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Many mixed-race people were absorbed into the majority culture based simply on appearance, associations and carrying out community responsibilities. These and community acceptance were the more important factors if a person's racial status were questioned, not his or her documented ancestry. Because of the [[social mobility]] of antebellum society in frontier areas, many people did not have documentation about their ancestors.

Based on [[DNA]] and historical evidence, [[Thomas Jefferson]] is widely believed to have fathered four surviving [[mixed-race]] children with his slave [[Sally Hemings]], who was three-quarters white by ancestry.{{#tag:ref|"Ten years later [referring to its 2000 report], TJF [Thomas Jefferson Foundation] and most historians now believe that, years after his wife's death, Thomas Jefferson was the father of the six children of Sally Hemings mentioned in Jefferson's records, including Beverly, Harriet, Madison and Eston Hemings."&lt;ref name="Sally Hemings 2011"&gt;[http://www.monticello.org/plantation/hemingscontro/hemings-jefferson_contro.html "Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account"], Monticello Website, accessed 22 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="quote"}} Her children were born into slavery but, as they were seven-eighths European in ancestry, they were legally white under Virginia law of the time.&lt;ref name="Sally Hemings 2011"/&gt; Jefferson allowed the two oldest to escape in 1822 (freeing them legally would have been a public action which he avoided); the two youngest he freed in his 1826 will. Three of the four entered white society as adults, and all their descendants identified as white.&lt;ref name="Sally Hemings 2011"/&gt; 

In the United States, White Americans usually classified people of partial [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] descent as Indian, in a similar example of hypodescent. In the early years of these types of unions and marriages, the fathers were usually white and the mothers Indian. As many American Indian tribes had [[matrilineal]] descent systems, within those communities, the children were considered by tradition to belong to the mother's [[clan]]. It was tradition for the mother's eldest brother to play a major role in the life of all her children, more important than that of the father within the tribe, as the uncle looked out for the children within his [[clan]], the father belonging to a different clan. Among such tribes, mixed-race children could be absorbed into the culture, as had been the case traditionally with captives of any race who were adopted. 

But, among other tribes who had a [[patrilineal]] system, such as the [[Omaha]], the full-bloods considered a [[half-breed]] a "white man" if he had a white father, which was their application of hypodescent. Half-breeds could belong officially to the Omaha tribe only if they were formally adopted into it by a male member.{{#tag:ref|In 1855, John Bigelk, nephew of Big Elk, described a Sioux attack in which the [[mixed-race]] man [[Logan Fontenelle]], son of an Omaha woman and a French trader, was killed: "They killed the white man, the interpreter, who was with us." As the historian Melvin Randolph Gilmore noted, Bigelk called Fontenelle 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"a white man because he had a white father. This was a common designation of [[mixed-race|half-breeds]] by full-bloods, just as a [[mulatto]] might commonly be called a [black] by white people, although as much white as black by race."&lt;ref name=TrueLogan&gt;Melvin Randolph Gilmore, [http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ne/topic/resources/OLLibrary/collections/vol19/v19p064.htm "The True Logan Fontenelle"], ''Publications of the Nebraska State Historical Society'', Vol. 19, edited by Albert Watkins, Nebraska State Historical Society, 1919, pp. 64–65, at GenNet, accessed 25 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the United States, the concept of the one-drop rule has been chiefly applied by White Americans to those of [[sub-Saharan]] black African ancestry in the 20th century, when they were trying to maintain white supremacy. The [[poet]] [[Langston Hughes]] wrote in his 1940 memoir:

{{quote|You see, unfortunately, I am not black. There are lots of different kinds of blood in our family. But here in the United States, the word 'Negro' is used to mean anyone who has any Negro blood at all in his veins. In Africa, the word is more pure. It means all Negro, therefore black. I am brown.&lt;ref&gt;Langston Hughes, ''The Big Sea, an Autobiography'' (New York: Knopf, 1940).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legislation and practice==
Both before and after the [[American Civil War]], many people of mixed ancestry who "looked white" and were of mostly white ancestry were legally absorbed into the white majority. State laws established differing standards. For instance, in 1822 Virginia law stated that to be defined as "[[mulatto]]" (that is, multi-racial), a person had to have at least one-quarter (equivalent to one grandparent) African ancestry.{{#tag:ref|"To be defined as 'mulatto' under Virginia law in 1822, a person had to have at least one-quarter African ancestry." (This is the equivalent to one grandparent.)&lt;ref name=Rothman/&gt;{{rp|68}}|group="quote"}} This was a looser definition than the state's 20th-century "one-drop rule" under the 1924 [[Racial Integrity Act]]. This defined a person as legally "colored" (black) for classification and legal purposes if the individual had '''any''' African ancestry. Social acceptance and identification were historically the key to classification.

Although the Virginia legislature increased restrictions on free blacks following the [[Nat Turner Rebellion]] of 1831, it refrained from establishing a one-drop rule.  When a proposal was made by Travis H. Eppes and debated in 1853, people realized that such a rule could adversely affect whites, as they were aware of generations of interracial relationships. During the debate, a person wrote to the [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] newspaper:

{{quote|[If a one-drop rule were adopted], I doubt not, if many who are reputed to be white, and are in fact so, do not in a very short time find themselves instead of being elevated, reduced by the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, to the level of a free negro.&lt;ref name=Rothman/&gt;{{rp|230}} }}

The state legislators agreed. No such law was passed until 1924, when people's historical memory appeared to have faded. 

The [[Melungeons]] are a group of multiracial families of mostly European and African ancestry whose ancestors were free in colonial Virginia. They migrated to the frontier in Kentucky and Tennessee. Their descendants have been documented over the decades as having tended to marry persons classified as "white".&lt;ref&gt;[http://freeafricanamericans.com Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware'', 1999–2005].&lt;/ref&gt; Their descendants became assimilated into the majority culture from the 19th into the 20th centuries.

Later in the century, southern states moved to restrict blacks. At the [[South Carolina]] constitutional convention in 1895, an anti-[[miscegenation]] law and changes that would [[Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disfranchise]] blacks were proposed. Delegates debated a proposal for a one-drop rule to include in these laws. [[George D. Tillman]] said the following in opposition:

{{quote|If the law is made as it now stands respectable families in Aiken, Barnwell, Colleton, and Orangeburg will be denied the right to intermarry among people with whom they are now associated and identified. At least one hundred families would be affected to my knowledge. They have sent good soldiers to the Confederate Army, and are now landowners and taxpayers. Those men served creditably, and it would be unjust and disgraceful to embarrass them in this way. It is a scientific fact that there is not one full-blooded Caucasian on the floor of this convention. Every member has in him a certain mixture of… colored blood. The pure-blooded white has needed and received a certain infusion of darker blood to give him readiness and purpose. It would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation, of scandal, horror, feud, and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote, perhaps obsolete trace of Negro blood. The doors would be open to scandal, malice, and greed; to statements on the witness stand that the father or grandfather or grandmother had said that A or B had Negro blood in their veins. Any man who is half a man would be ready to blow up half the world with dynamite to prevent or avenge attacks upon the honor of his mother in the legitimacy or purity of the blood of his father.&lt;ref name="courier"&gt;"All Niggers, More or Less!", ''The News and Courier'', October 17, 1895.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joel Williamson, ''New People: Miscegenation and Mulattoes in the United States'' (New York, 1980), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1865, Florida passed an act that both outlawed miscegenation and defined the amount of Black ancestry needed to be legally defined as a "person of color". The act stated that "every person who shall have one-eighth or more of negro blood shall be deemed and held to be a person of color." Additionally, the act outlawed marriage, fornication, and the intermarrying of white females with men of color; however the act permitted the continuation of marriages between white persons and persons of color that were contracted before the law was enacted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=kAI4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=Laws+of+the+State+of+Florida,+First+Session+of+the+Fourteenth+General+Assembly+Under+the+Amended+Constitution+1865-6&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=itF_t21WYg&amp;sig=kLxpaFDXlBW6JaPj95kS972f5iQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=21o7UqTEHLaz4AOR7IG4CA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Laws%20of%20the%20State%20of%20Florida%2C%20First%20Session%20of%20the%20Fourteenth%20General%20Assembly%20Under%20the%20Amended%20Constitution%201865-6&amp;f=false ''Laws of the State of Florida, First Session of the Fourteenth General Assembly Under the Amended Constitution 1865–'6'']. Chapter 1, 468 Sec.(1)-(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

The one-drop rule was made law, chiefly in the U.S. South but also in other states, in the 20th century – decades after the Civil War, [[emancipation]] and [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], but following the restoration of [[white supremacy]] in the South and the passage of [[Jim Crow]] [[racial segregation]] laws. In the 20th century, it was also associated with the rise of [[eugenics]] and ideas of [[racial purity]]. From the late 1870s on, white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] regained political power in the former Confederate states and passed racial [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] laws controlling public facilities, and laws and constitutions from 1890 to 1910 to achieve disfranchisement of most blacks. Many poor whites were also disfranchised in these years, by changes to voter registration rules that worked against them, such as [[literacy tests]], longer residency requirements and [[poll taxes]].

The first challenges to such state laws were overruled by [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] decisions which upheld state constitutions that effectively disfranchised many. White Democratic-dominated legislatures proceeded with passing [[Jim Crow laws]] that instituted racial segregation in public places and accommodations, and passed other restrictive voting legislation. In ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', the Supreme Court allowed racial segregation of public facilities, under the "separate but equal" doctrine.

Jim Crow laws reached their greatest influence during the decades from 1910 to 1930. Among them were hypodescent laws, defining as black anyone with any black ancestry, or with a very small portion of black ancestry.&lt;ref name="highered.mcgraw-hill" /&gt;  [[Tennessee]] adopted such a "one-drop" statute in 1910, and [[Louisiana]] soon followed. Then [[Texas]] and [[Arkansas]] in 1911, [[Mississippi]] in 1917, [[North Carolina]] in 1923, [[Virginia]] in 1924, [[Alabama]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1927, and [[Oklahoma]] in 1931. During this same period, [[Florida]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maryland]], [[Missouri]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]], and [[Utah]] retained their old "blood fraction" statutes ''[[de jure]]'', but amended these fractions (one-sixteenth, one-thirty-second) to be equivalent to one-drop ''[[de facto]].''&lt;ref&gt;Pauli Murray, ed. ''States' Laws on Race and Color'' (Athens, 1997), 428, 173, 443, 37, 237, 330, 463, 22, 39, 358, 77, 150, 164, 207, 254, 263, 459.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1930, individuals of visible mixed European and African ancestry were usually classed as [[mulatto]]es, or sometimes as black and sometimes as white, depending on appearance. Previously, most states had limited trying to define ancestry before "the fourth degree" (great-great-grandparents). In 1930, the Census Bureau stopped using the classification of mulatto, so evidence of the long social acknowledgement of mixed-race people was lost.

The one-drop rule disregarded the self-identification of people of mostly European ancestry who grew up in white communities, and of people who identified as American Indian and were of [[mixed race]]. In addition, [[Walter Plecker]], Registrar of Statistics, ordered application of the 1924 Virginia law in such a way that vital records were changed or destroyed, family members were split on opposite sides of the color line, and there were losses of the documented continuity of mixed-race people who identified as American Indian. Over the centuries, many Indian tribes in Virginia had absorbed people of other ethnicities through marriage or adoption, but maintained their cultures. Suspecting blacks of trying to "[[Passing (racial identity)|pass]]" as Indians, Plecker ordered records changed to classify people only as black or white, and ordered offices to reclassify certain family surnames from Indian to black. 

Since the late 20th century, Virginia has officially recognized eight American Indian tribes and their members; the tribes are trying to gain federal recognition. They have had difficulty because decades of birth, marriage, and death records were misclassified under Plecker's application of the law. No one was classified as Indian, although many individuals and families identified that way and were preserving their cultures.

In the case of mixed-race [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] and European descendants, the one-drop rule in Virginia was extended only so far as those with more than one-sixteenth Indian blood.  This was due to what was known as the "[[Pocahontas]] exception". Since many influential [[First Families of Virginia]] (FFV) claimed descent from the American Indian [[Pocahontas]] and her husband [[John Rolfe]] of the colonial era, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] declared that an individual could be considered white if having no more than one-sixteenth Indian "blood" (the equivalent of one great-great-grandparent).

The [[eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]] of New York wrote in his book, ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' (1916): "The cross between a white man and an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] is an Indian; the cross between a white man and a Negro is a Negro; the cross between a white man and a [[Historical definitions of races in India|Hindu]] is a Hindu; and the cross between any of the three European races and a [[Jew]] is a Jew."&lt;ref&gt;Madison Grant, ''The Passing of the Great Race'', 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; As noted above, Native American tribes such as the Omaha, which had patrilineal descent and inheritance, used hypodescent among themselves to classify the children of white men and Native American women as white.

{{main|Walter Plecker}}
Through the 1940s, [[Walter Plecker]] of Virginia&lt;ref&gt;For the Plecker story, see J. Douglas Smith, "The Campaign for Racial Purity and the Erosion of Paternalism in Virginia, 1922–1930: 'Nominally White, Biologically Mixed, and Legally Negro'", ''Journal of Southern History'' 68, no. 1 (2002): 65–106.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Naomi Drake]] of [[Louisiana]]&lt;ref&gt;For Drake, see Virginia R. Dominguez, ''White by Definition: Social Classification in Creole Louisiana'' (New Brunswick NJ: Rutgers University, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; had an outsized influence. As the Registrar of Statistics, Plecker insisted on labeling mixed-race families of European-African ancestry as black. In 1924, Plecker wrote, "Two races as materially divergent as the White and Negro, in morals, mental powers, and cultural fitness, cannot live in close contact without injury to the higher." A subtext was the assumption that Blacks were somehow "improved" through White admixture. In the 1930s and 1940s, Plecker directed offices under his authority to change vital records and reclassify certain families as black (or colored) (without notifying them) after Virginia established a binary system under its Racial Integrity Act of 1924. He also classified people who had formerly self-identified as Indian, as black. When the United States Supreme Court struck down Virginia's law prohibiting inter-racial marriage in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' (1967), it also declared Plecker's [[Racial Integrity Act of 1924|Virginia Racial Integrity Act]] and the one-drop rule unconstitutional.

Many people in the U.S., among various ethnic groups, continue to have their own concepts related to the one-drop ideas. They may still consider those multiracial individuals with any African ancestry to be black, or at least non-white (if the person has other minority ancestry), unless the person explicitly identifies as white. Today's ideas have also been influenced by the [[Black Power Movement]] and leaders within the black community, who have claimed as black those persons with any African ancestry, regardless of how they self-identified.  This was in reaction to white practice and also an effort to build black political power. In the late 20th and early 21st century, writers such as A.D. Powell, who is multiracial, consider such "claiming" to be another kind of one-drop rule, which ignores people's life experiences, their community, and how they choose to identify themselves.&lt;ref&gt;A.D. Powell, ''Passing for Who You Really Are'', Palm Coast, 2005, ISBN 0-939479-22-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of self-identified multi-racial people in the US is increasing.

==Other countries of the Americas==
{{See also|Race in Brazil}}
Among the colonial slave societies, the United States was nearly unique in developing the one-drop rule; it derived both from the Southern slave culture (shared by other societies) and the aftermath of the [[American Civil War]], [[emancipation]] of slaves, and [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. In the late 19th century, Southern whites regained political power and restored [[white supremacy]], passing [[Jim Crow]] laws and establishing [[racial segregation]] by law. In the 20th century, during the Black Power Movement, black race-based groups claimed all people of any African ancestry as black in a reverse way, to establish political power. 

People in many other countries have tended to treat race less rigidly, both in their self-identification and how they regard others. Just as a person with physically recognizable sub-Saharan ancestry can claim to be black in the United States, someone with recognizable [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] ancestry may be considered white in [[Brazil]], even if mixed race.

In colonial [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]], many soldiers and explorers took [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] women as wives. Native-born Spanish women were always a minority. The colonists developed an elaborate classification and [[Casta|caste system]] that identified the mixed-race descendants of blacks, [[Amerindian]]s, and whites by different names, related to appearance and known ancestry. Racial caste not only depended on ancestry or skin color, but also could be raised or lowered by the person's financial status or class.  

In December 2002, the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' ran a story on the one-drop theory and differences in Latin American practices. In the reporter's opinion: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Someone with [[Sidney Poitier]]'s deep chocolate complexion would be considered white if his hair were straight and he made a living in a profession. That might not seem so odd, Brazilians say, when you consider that the fair-complexioned actresses [[Rashida Jones]] ('[[Parks and Recreation]]' and '[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]') and [[Lena Horne]] are identified as black in the United States."&lt;ref name=WPost&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A38089-2002Dec25?language=printer washingtonpost.com: "People of Color Who Never Felt They Were Black"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:RashidaJonesSideMarch09.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Rashida Jones]]]]

According to Jose Neinstein, a native white Brazilian and executive director of the [[Brazilian American|Brazilian-American]] Cultural Institute in Washington, in the United States, "If you are not quite white, then you are black." However, in Brazil, "If you are not quite black, then you are white." Neinstein recalls talking with a man of Poitier's complexion when in Brazil: "We were discussing ethnicity, and I asked him, 'What do you think about this from your perspective as a black man?' He turned his head to me and said, 'I'm not black,' ... It simply paralyzed me. I couldn't ask another question."&lt;ref name=WPost/&gt;



The same racial culture shock has come to hundreds of thousands of dark-skinned immigrants to the United States from Brazil, [[Colombia]], [[Panama]], and other Latin American nations.  Although many are not considered black in their homelands, they have often been considered black in US society. According to the ''Washington Post'', their refusal to accept the United States' definition of black has left many feeling attacked from all directions. At times, white and black Americans might discriminate against them for their lighter or darker skin tones; African Americans might believe that [[Afro-Latin American|Afro-Latino]] immigrants are denying their blackness. At the same time, the immigrants think [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|lighter-skinned Latinos]] dominate [[Television in the United States#Broadcast television in non-English languages|Spanish-language television]] and media. A majority of [[Latin Americans]] possess some African or American Indian ancestry. Many of these immigrants feel it is difficult to accept a new language and culture without the additional burden of having to transform from white to black. Yvette Modestin, a dark-skinned native of Panama who worked in [[Boston]], said the situation was overwhelming: "There's not a day that I don't have to explain myself."&lt;ref name=WPost/&gt;

[[File:Condoleezza Rice Colin Powell George W. Bush Donald Rumsfeld.jpg|thumb|[[Condoleezza Rice|Rice]] and [[Colin Powell|Powell]] (on the left) are considered black in the US, [[George W. Bush|Bush]] and [[Donald Rumsfeld|Rumsfeld]] (on the right) are considered white.]]
Professor J.B. Bird has said that Latin America is not alone in rejecting the historical US notion that any visible African ancestry is enough to make one black: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In most countries of the Caribbean, [[Colin Powell]] would be described as a [[Creole peoples#Caribbean|Creole]], reflecting his mixed heritage. In [[Belize]], he might further be described as a 'High Creole', because of his extremely light complexion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnhorse.com/black-seminoles/faq-black-seminoles.htm FAQ on the Black Seminoles, John Horse, and Rebellion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;These examples show that the perception of race is relative to different societies and individuals.

During this period, [[Puerto Rico]] had laws such as the ''Regla del Sacar'' or ''Gracias al Sacar,'' by which a person of black ancestry could be considered legally white so long as the individual could prove that at least one person per generation in the last four generations had also been legally white. Thus persons of black ancestry with known white lineage were classified as white, the opposite of the "one-drop rule" in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Jay Kinsbruner, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;id=qLSU-SiojsYC&amp;dq=Jay+Kinsbruner,+Not+of+Pure+Blood,&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=utW9BXA--9&amp;sig=Sa7e_6rupXyUWxsgYWC4kL-1pew#PPP13,M1 ''Not of Pure Blood''], Duke University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racial mixtures of blacks and whites in modern America==
Given the intense interest in ethnicity, genetic [[genealogists]] and other scientists have studied population groups. [[Henry Louis Gates|Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]] publicized such genetic studies on his two series ''African American Lives,'' shown on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], in which the ancestry of prominent figures was explored. 

The specialists summarized United States population figures this way:
*58 percent of African Americans have at least 12.5% European ancestry (equivalent of one great-grandparent);
*19.6 percent of African Americans have at least 25% European ancestry (equivalent of one grandparent);
*1 percent of African Americans have at least 50% European ancestry (equivalent of one parent) (Gates is one of these, he discovered); and
*5 percent of African Americans have at least 12.5% Native American ancestry (equivalent to one great-grandparent).&lt;ref&gt;Henry Louis Gates, Jr., ''In Search of Our Roots: How 19 Extraordinary African Americans Reclaimed Their Past'' (New York: Crown Publishing, 2009), pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Mark D. Shriver]], a molecular [[anthropologist]] at Penn State University, published results of a study regarding the racial admixture of Americans who identified as white or black:&lt;ref name=Shriver&gt;Steve Sailer, [http://www.isteve.com/2002_How_White_Are_Blacks.htm "Race Now": Part 2: "How White Are Blacks? How Black Are Whites?"], UPI, Steve Sailer Website.&lt;/ref&gt; Shriver surveyed a 3,000-person sample from 25 locations in the United States and tested subjects for genetic make-up:

* Among those who self-identified as white:
** The average was 0.7% black ancestry, which is the equivalent of having 1 black and 127 white ancestors among one's 128 5×great-grandparents
** Shriver estimates that 70% of white Americans have no African ancestors (in part because of the greatly increased immigration from Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries).
**Among the 30% who do have African ancestry, Shriver estimates their black racial admixture is 2.3%; the equivalent of having had 3 black ancestors among their 128 5×great-grandparents.&lt;ref name=Shriver/&gt;

* Among those who self-identified as black:
** The average was 18% white ancestry, the equivalent of having 22 white ancestors among their 128 5×great-grandparents.
** About 10% have more than 50% white ancestry. 

Blacks are thus more racially mixed than whites, reflecting historical experience in the United States, including the close living and working conditions among colonial indentured servants, both black and white, and slaves, when many married or formed unions. Most of the free African-American families in Virginia in colonial years were the descendants of white women and African men. After the [[American Revolutionary War]], their descendants migrated to nearby states along with other Virginia pioneers.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Heinegg, [http://www.freeafricanamericans.com ''Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware''], 1999–2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The admixture also reflects conditions under slavery, when white planters or their sons, or overseers, frequently used African women for sex.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} There were also freely chosen relationships among individuals of different or mixed races.

Shriver's survey found different admixture rates by region, which would also reflect historic patterns of settlement and change, both in terms of populations who migrated and their descendants' marriages. For example, the black populations with the highest average white ancestry lived in California and Seattle, both destinations during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of 1940–1970 out of the Deep South of Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi. Blacks sampled in those two locations had more than 25% white European ancestry on average.&lt;ref name=Shriver/&gt;

[[Charles W. Chesnutt]], who was of mixed race and grew up in the North, wrote stories and novels about the issues of mixed-race people in southern society in the aftermath of the Civil War.

The one-drop rule and its consequences have been the subject of numerous works of popular culture. In the American [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Show Boat]]'', set in the 19th century, Steve, a white man who is married to a mixed-race woman (considered black), is pursued by a Southern sheriff, who is going to arrest Steve and charge him with [[miscegenation]]. Steve pricks his wife's finger and swallows some of her blood. When the sheriff arrives, Steve asks him whether he would consider a man to be white if he had "negro blood" in him. The sheriff replies that "one drop of Negro blood makes you a Negro in these parts". Steve tells the sheriff that he has "more than a drop of negro blood in me". After being assured by others that Steve is telling the truth, the sheriff leaves without arresting Steve.&lt;ref name=tcm&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?scarlettTitleId=14440 ''Show Boat'' (1951) Overview], Turner Classic Movies.
