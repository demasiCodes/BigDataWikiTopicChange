These consequences range from [[Unemployment|job loss]] and social isolation to [[incarceration]], [[torture]] or [[death]]. Typically, such a conversion entails the repudiation of former religious or philosophical convictions.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

==Christianity==

Christianity officially rejects the idea of forced conversion, as conversion is seen not as an external proclamation but internal beliefs ({{bibleref2|Romans|10:9-10|NKJV}}) {{Fact|date=October 2007}}. However, Christians have not always followed the New Testament mandate, which posed the question of how to deal with such conversions under duress. [[Pope Innocent III]], who denounced forced conversions, pronounced in 1201 that even if torture and intimidation had been employed in receiving the sacrament, one nevertheless: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;...does receive the impress of Christianity and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling. ... [For] the grace of Baptism had been received, and they had been [[confirmation (sacrament)|anointed with the sacred oil]], and had [[eucharist|participated in the body of the Lord]], they might properly be forced to hold to the faith which they had accepted perforce, lest the name of the Lord be blasphemed, and lest they hold in contempt and consider vile the faith they had joined.&lt;ref&gt;Grayzel, Solomon, ''The Church and the Jews in the Thirteenth Century'', rev. ed., New York: Hermon, 1966, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The "[[New Christian]]s" were inhabitants of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] ([[Sephardi]]c Jews or [[Mudéjar]] Muslims) during the Middle Ages and the Early Modern Era who were baptized  under coercion, becoming [[Converso]]s or [[Morisco]]s. In spite of their new faith, they were suspected by the "Old Christians" of being [[Crypto-Jew]]s or [[crypto-Islam|Crypto-Muslim]]s. Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492 and from [[Portugal]] in 1497.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.home.earthlink.net/~benven/annivers.html 500 ANNIVERSARY OF THE FORCED CONVERSION OF THE JEWS OF PORTUGAL&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Serbs]] were forcibly converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] under threat of death by the Croatian [[Ustaša]].{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

Religious Persecution took place by the Portuguese in Goa, India from 16th to the 17th century. The natives of Goa were subjected to severe torture and oppression by the zealous Portuguese rulers and missionaries. This persecution by the Portuguese in westerns parts of India has resulted in more then 5 million Christian faith followers in India today.

In [[Communist Romania]], followers of the [[Romanian Greek-Catholic Church]] were forced to join the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] by the government.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

In the People's Republic of China, [[Roman Catholicism in China|Roman Catholics]] are forced to join the [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Church]].{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

==Islam==
[[Islam]] scripture forbids forced conversion. Surah {{cite quran|2|256|expand=no|style=nosup}} is frequently cited: "Let there be no compulsion in religion".&lt;ref&gt;Sir Thomas W. Arnold, ''The Preaching of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall G. Hodgson, ''The Venture of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Hourani, ''A History of the Arab Peoples''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ira Lapidus, ''History of Islamic Societies''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.S. Starorianos, ''A Global History, the Human Heritage''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karen Armstrong]] asserts that after [[Muhammad]]'s death, nobody in the Islamic empire was forced to accept the Islamic faith.&lt;ref name="arm2"&gt;Armstrong, A History of God: from Abraham to the Present: the 4000-year Quest for God, 1993, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to Levy-Rubin, despite its supposed ambivalence by [[Islamic law]], forced conversions - such as of Ibn Firāsa against [[Samaritan]]s - have taken place under Islamic rule.&lt;ref&gt;M. Levy-Rubin,  "New evidence relating to the process of Islamization in Palestine in the Early Muslim Period - The Case of Samaria", in: ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient'', 43 (3), p. 257-276, 2000, [[Springer]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fattal, A.(1958) ''Le statut légal des non-Musulman en pays d'Islam'', Beyrouth: Imprimerie Catholique, p. 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt; Forced conversions played a role especially in the 12th century under the [[Almohad]] dynasty of [[North Africa]] and [[al-Andalus|Andalusia]] as well as in [[Persia]] where [[Shi'a]] Islam is dominant.&lt;ref name="conseq"&gt;Lewis (1984), p. 17, 18, 94, 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twenty-first century allegations==

In 2001 the [[Indonesia]]n army evacuated hundreds of Christian refugees from the remote [[Kesui]] and [[Teor]] islands in [[Maluku]] province after the refugees stated that they had been forced to convert to Islam. According to reports, some of the men had been circumcised against their will, and a paramilitary group involved in the incident confirmed that circumcisions had taken place while denying any element of coercion. 
&lt;ref&gt;Maluku refugees allege forced circumcision, BBC News Online, Wednesday, 31 January, 2001 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1146224.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2006 two journalists, [[Steve Centanni]] and [[Olaf Wiig]], were kidnapped by [[Holy Jihad Brigades]] in [[Gaza City]], and were apparently forced to convert to [[Islam]] at gunpoint. The Palestinian news service Ramattan and Fox News reported that they were released unharmed shortly after the release of a new video.&lt;ref name="Fox"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kidnapped Fox journalists released|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=August 27|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/27/fox.journalists/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the video, both journalists, wearing beige robes, read statements saying that they had converted to Islam, with Centanni stating "Islam is not just meant for some people; it is the true religion for all people at all times."&lt;ref name="Fox"/&gt;After being freed, Steve Centanni stated, "We were forced to convert to Islam at gunpoint, and don't get me wrong here, I have the highest respect for Islam, and learned a lot of very good things about it, but it was something we felt we had to do, because they had the guns, and we didn't know what the hell was going on."&lt;ref name="Fox"/&gt;

It was reported in February 2007 that Hindu and Sikh organisations in the UK believe that young women of these faiths are being coerced by young men they meet at university into converting to Islam. The chief of the [[Metropolitan Police]], [[Sir Ian Blair]] attended a conference where the allegations were made. A spokeswoman for the police said: "We are aware of it as an issue that concerns the Hindu community but are not aware, without further research, of any specific incidents reported to police. We would encourage anyone who has been targeted in this way to seek help."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article1464601.ece Times Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, members of the Christian community of [[Charsadda]] in the [[North West Frontier Province]] of [[Pakistan]], close to the border of [[Afghanistan]], reported that they had received letters threatening bombings if they did not convert to Islam, and that the police were not taking their fears seriously. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,273075,00.html Report on Fox News, from AP]&lt;/ref&gt;
