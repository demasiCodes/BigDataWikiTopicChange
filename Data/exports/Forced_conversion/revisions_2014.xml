A '''forced conversion''' is the [[religious conversion]] or acceptance of a philosophy against the will of the subject, often with the threatened consequence of earthly penalties or harm. These consequences range from [[job loss]] and [[social isolation]] to [[incarceration]], [[torture]] or [[death]]. It is a form of [[religious cleansing]].

==Religion and power==
In general, [[anthropologists]] have shown that the relationship between [[religion and politics]] is complex, especially when viewed over the expanse of human history.&lt;ref name=Firth&gt;Firth, Raymond (1981) [http://www.jstor.org/stable/676754 Spiritual Aroma: Religion and Politics].  ''American Anthropologist'', New Series, Vol. 83, No. 3, pp. 582–601&lt;/ref&gt;  While religion and the state have generally different aims, both are concerned with power and order; both use reason and emotion to motivate behavior.  And throughout history, leaders of religious and political institutions have cooperated, opposed one another, and attempted to co-op each other, for purposes both noble and base, and have implemented programs with a wide range of driving values, from compassion aimed at alleviating current suffering to brutal change aimed at achieving longer term goals, for the benefit of narrow groups ranging from small cliques to all of humanity. The relationship is far from simple.  But there is no doubt that religion has been used coercively, and has used coercion.&lt;ref name=Firth/&gt;   

== Christianity==
{{see also|Christianization}}
[[Early Christianity]] was a minority religion in the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|the early Christians were themselves persecuted during that time]]. After [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine I converted to Christianity]], it became the dominant religion in the Roman Empire. Already under the reign of Constantine I, Christian heretics had been persecuted; beginning in the late 4th century AD also the ancient pagan religions were actively suppressed. In the view of many historians, the [[Constantinian shift]] turned Christianity from a persecuted religion into one capable and sometimes eager to persecute.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g.: John Coffey, ''Persecution and Toleration on Protestant England 1558-1689'', 2000, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many examples throughout the history of Christianity: during the Roman empire, in the middle ages, inquisitions in Spain and Goa, forced conversion of indigenous children, and against Hindus. 

===End of Roman empire===
In 392 Emperor [[Theodosius I]] decreed that [[Christianity]] was the only legal religion of the [[Roman Empire]], and forbidding pagan practices by law:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is Our will that all the peoples who are ruled by the administration of Our Clemency shall practice that religion which the divine Peter the Apostle transmitted to the Romans....The rest, whom We adjudge demented and insane, shall sustain the infamy of heretical dogmas, their meeting places shall not receive the name of churches, and they shall be smitten first by divine vengeance and secondly by the retribution of Our own initiative''" ([[Codex Theodosianus]] XVI 1.2.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/greece/paganism/paganism.html |title=Paganism and Rome |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Much of the Roman world, however, remained pagan for centuries.

===Medieval era===
During the [[Saxon Wars]], [[Charlemagne]], [[King of the Franks]], forcibly Roman Catholicized the [[Saxons]] from their native [[Germanic paganism]] by way of warfare and law upon conquest. Examples include the [[Massacre of Verden]] in 782, during which Charlemagne reportedly had 4,500 captive Saxons massacred upon rebelling against conversion, and the ''[[Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae]]'', a law imposed on conquered Saxons in 785 which prescribes death to those that refuse to convert to Christianity.&lt;ref name="CHARLEMAGNE"&gt;For the Massacre of Verden, see Barbero, Alessandro (2004). ''Charlemagne: Father of a Continent'', page 46. [[University of California Press]]. For the ''Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae'', see Riché, Pierre (1993). ''The Carolingians''. [[University of Pennsylvania Press]]. ISBN 978-0-8122-1342-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Crusades'', by Bernard Hamilton, 1998, Sutton Publishing, United Kingdom, Chapter 9: Later Crusades, p. 87:   “In 1309 the [[Teutonic Order]] moved its headquarters to Marienburg in Prussia.  It had a papal license to wage perpetual war against the pagans and used this to launch annual crusades against [[Lithuania]].  These expeditions were very popular with the nobility of northern Europe: campaigns were held twice a year, in the summer and in the winter when the order laid on special Christmas festivities for visiting crusaders.” “The excuse for men who enjoyed fighting and to lay waste large parts of Lithuania in the name of Christ was removed in 1386 when the [[King of Lithuania]], [[Jagiello]], married [[Queen Jadwiga of Poland]] and received Catholic baptism.  The two kingdoms were united under Christian rulers and the Teutonic Knights no longer had any justification for crusading against pagans there.”&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Innocent III]] pronounced in 1201 that even if torture and intimidation had been employed in receiving the sacrament, one nevertheless:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...does receive the impress of Christianity and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling. ... [For] the grace of Baptism had been received, and they had been [[confirmation (sacrament)|anointed with the sacred oil]], and had [[eucharist|participated in the body of the Lord]], they might properly be forced to hold to the faith which they had accepted perforce, lest the name of the Lord be blasphemed, and lest they hold in contempt and consider vile the faith they had joined.&lt;ref&gt;Grayzel, Solomon, ''The Church and the Jews in the Thirteenth Century'', rev. ed., New York: Hermon, 1966, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Spanish Inquisition===
{{main|Spanish inquisition}}
After the end of the [[Al-Andalus|Islamic control of Spain]], Muslims and Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492 and from Portugal in 1497.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lowenstein|first=Steven|title=The Jewish Cultural Tapestry: International Jewish Folk Traditions|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=36|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EWToS3VyqVMC&amp;dq=jewish+cultural+tapestry&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Reconquista]], so called "[[New Christian]]s" were those inhabitants ([[Sephardi]]c Jews or [[Mudéjar]] Muslims) during the Middle Ages and the Early Modern Era who were baptized under coercion and in the face of murder, becoming forced converts from Islam ([[Morisco]]s, [[Converso]]s and ''secret Moors'') and forced converts from [[Judaism]] ([[Converso]]s, [[Crypto-Judaism|Crypto-Jews]] and [[Marrano]]s). 
Then the [[Spanish Inquisition]] targeted primarily forced converts from Judaism who came under suspicion of either continuing to adhere to their old religion or of having fallen back into it. Jewish conversos still resided in Spain and often hiddenly (cryptically) practiced Judaism and were suspected by the "Old Christians" of being [[Crypto-Jew]]s. The Spanish Inquisition generated much wealth and income for the church and individual inquisitors by confiscating the property of the persecutees or selling them into slavery. The end of the [[Al-Andalus]] and the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion of the Sephardic Jews]] from the Iberian Peninsula went hand in hand with the increase of Spanish-Portugal influence in the world, as exemplified in the Christian conquest of the Americas and their aboriginal Indian population. The Ottoman empire, the Netherlands, and the New World absorbed much of the Jewish refugees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejerusalemconnection.us/news-archive/tag/inquisition 3000 Years of Sephardic History] Jerusalem Connection Writers Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goa inquisition===
{{Main|Goa Inquisition}}
Religious persecution took place by the Portuguese in [[Goa]], India from 16th to the 17th century. The natives of Goa, most of them Hindus were subjected to [[Goa Inquisition|severe torture and oppression]] by the zealous Portuguese rulers and missionaries and forcibly converted to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=RS1uAAAAMAAJ Of umbrellas, goddesses, and dreams: essays on Goan culture and society] Robert Samuel Newman, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Goa Inquisition (book)|The Goa Inquisition, Being a Quatercentenary Commemoration Study of the Inquisition in India]] by Anant Priolkar, Bombay University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=hSnn_kDUI6AC&amp;pg=PA69 Everyday Nationalism: Women of the Hindu Right in India] Kalyani Devaki Menon, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ftS1AAAAIAAJ Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bombay] 1967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.

In 1567, the campaign of destroying temples in Bardez met with success. At the end of it 300 Hindu temples were destroyed. Enacting laws, prohibition was laid from December 4, 1567 on rituals of Hindu marriages, sacred thread wearing and cremation. All the persons above 15 years of age were compelled to listen to Christian preaching, failing which they were punished. In 1583, Hindu temples at Assolna and Cuncolim were destroyed through army action. "The fathers of the Church forbade the Hindus under terrible penalties the use of their own sacred books, and prevented them from all exercise of their religion. They destroyed their temples, and so harassed and interfered with the people that they abandoned the city in large numbers, refusing to remain any longer in a place where they had no liberty, and were liable to imprisonment, torture and death if they worshipped after their own fashion the gods of their fathers." wrote Filippo Sassetti, who was in India from 1578 to 1588. An order was issued in June 1684 for suppressing the Konkani language and making it compulsory to speak the Portuguese language. The law provided for dealing toughly with anyone using the local language. Following that law all the non-Christian cultural symbols and the books written in local languages were sought to be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/28411503/Goa-Inquisition-for-Colonial-Disciplining |title=Goa Inquisition for Colonial Disciplining |publisher=Scribd.com |date=2010-03-15 |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods such as repressive laws, demolition of temples and mosques, destruction of holy books, fines and the forcible conversion of orphans were used.&lt;ref&gt;Mascarenhas-Keyes, Stella (1979), Goans in London: portrait of a Catholic Asian community, Goan Association (UK)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous children===
[[Indigenous peoples]] colonized by Christians have been subject to forced conversions.  Programs to convert children have been common.

====North America====
The government paid religious societies to provide education to Native American children on reservations. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) founded additional [[American Indian boarding schools]] based on the assimilation model of the [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]].
 
Children were usually immersed in European-American culture through appearance changes with haircuts, were forbidden to speak their native languages, and traditional names were replaced by new European-American names. The experience of the schools was often harsh, especially for the younger children who were separated from their families. In numerous ways, they were encouraged or forced to abandon their Native American identities and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback |date=20050829051045 |url=http://sacbee.com/static/archive/news/projects/native/day2_main.html |title="Long-suffering urban Indians find roots in ancient rituals".

Retrieved February 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Native American children in the boarding schools reached a peak in the 1970s, with an estimated enrollment of 60,000 in 1973. Especially through investigations of the later twentieth century, there have been many documented cases of sexual, physical and mental abuse occurring at such schools.&lt;ref&gt;"Developmental and learning disabilities".

Retrieved February 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Since those years, tribal nations have increasingly insisted on community-based schools and have also founded numerous tribally controlled colleges. Community schools have also been supported by the federal government through the BIA and legislation. The largest boarding schools have closed. In some cases, reservations or tribes were too small or poor to support independent schools and still wanted an alternative for their children, especially for high school. By 2007, the number of Native American children in boarding schools had declined to 9,500.

The '''Stolen Generations''' (also known as '''Stolen children''') were the children of [[Aboriginal Australians|Australian Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders|Torres Strait Islander]] descent who were removed from their families by the Australian [[Government of Australia|Federal]] and [[States and territories of Australia|State]] government agencies and [[Mission (Christianity)|church missions]], under [[Act of Parliament|acts]] of their respective parliaments.

[[Bernard Blasius Moras|Archbishop Moras]], refuting allegations of forced conversions and the charges of conversions against the Christian missionaries, said "We do not believe in forced conversions" and "It is easy to charge people with wrong allegations but difficult to stop evil powers that are working against Christians".&lt;ref&gt;[http://mangalorean.com/news.php?newstype=broadcast&amp;broadcastid=98889 Satisfied with govt action- Archbishop Moras]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
Indian Christians have alleged that "radical Hindu groups" in [[Orissa]], India have forced Christian converts from Hinduism to "revert"&lt;ref name="revert"&gt;the word ''revert'' is used in this context; not ''convert''; see [http://www.jstor.org/stable/4413900 Older than the Church: Christianity and Caste in The God of Small Things India] by A Sekhar;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/mar/11/proselytism-on-the-table Washington post article]&lt;/ref&gt; to Hinduism. These "religious riots" were largely between two tribal groups in [[Orissa]], one of which was predominantly Hindu and another predominantly Christian, over the [[Murder of Swami Lakshmanananda|assassination]] of a Hindu leader named [[Swami Lakshmanananda]] by Christian [[Maoists]] operating as terrorist groups in India (see [[Naxalite]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindujagruti.org/news/5576.html |title=We killed Swami Laxmananda: Christian Maoist leader – Attack |publisher=hindujagruti.org |date=2008-10-06 |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the violence, American Christian evangelical groups have claimed that Hindu groups are "forcibly reverting" Christians converts from Hinduism back to Hinduism.&lt;ref name="revert" /&gt; However, some local Christian groups have dismissed these allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.rediff.com/report/2009/aug/14/orissa-christian-leaders-disagree-with-us-report.htm|title= Orissa: Christian leaders disagree with US panel's report|date= 2009-08-14|publisher=Rediff News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==

Forced conversions occurred under the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean Empire]]. The Idumaens were forced to convert to Judaism, either by threats of exile, or threats of death, depending on the source.&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus Antiquities 13.257–258&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristobulus I|Aristobulus]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In ''Eusebíus, Christianity, and Judaism''  Harold W. Attridge  claims that “there is reason to think that Josephus’ account of their conversion is substantially accurate.” He also writes, “That these were not isolated instances but that forced conversion was a national policy is clear from the fact that Alexander Jannaeus (ca 80 BCE) demolished the city of Pella in Moab, ‘because the inhabitants would not agree to adopt the national custom of the Jews.’” Josephus, Antiquities. 13.15.4.&lt;ref&gt;Harold W. Attridge, Gōhei Hata (eds). ''Eusebius, Christianity, and Judaism'' Wayne State University Press, 1992: p. 387&lt;/ref&gt;

Maurice Sartre has written of the "policy of forced Judaization adopted by [[John Hyrcanus|Hyrcanos]], [[Aristobulus I]] and [[Jannaeus]]”, who offered "the conquered peoples a choice between expulsion or conversion,”&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Sartre. ''The Middle East Under Rome''. Harvard University Press, 2005: p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

William Horbury has written that “The evidence is best explained by postulating that an existing small Jewish population in Lower Galilee was massively expanded by the forced conversion in c.104 BCE of their Gentile neighbours in the north.”&lt;ref&gt;William Horbury. ''The Cambridge History of Judaism 2 Part Set: Volume 3, The Early Roman Period'' Cambridge University Press, 1999: p. 599&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the [[BBC]] defended a claim that in 524CE the Yemeni Jewish Himyar tribe, led by King Dhu Nuwashad offered Christian residents of a village in Saudi Arabia the choice between conversion to Judaism or death and that 20,000 Christians had then been massacred stating that "The production team spoke to many historians over 18 months, among them Nigel Groom, who was our consultant, and Professor Abdul Rahman Al-Ansary [former professor of archaeology at the King Saud University in Riyadh]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/historians-back-bbc-over-jewish-massacre-claim |title=Historians back BBC over Jewish massacre claim &amp;#124; The Jewish Chronicle |publisher=Thejc.com |date=2009-09-18 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions documented by Yousef himself shows the great pride he expressed after massacring more than 22,000 Christians in [[Zafar, Yemen|Zafar]] and [[Najran]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Ryckmans,La persécution des chrétiens himyarites au sixième siècle Nederlands Historisch-Archaeologisch Inst. in het Nabije Oosten, 1956 pp 1-24&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians point out that forced conversions have occurred during Islamic history.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Martin A. "Social and economic factors in the Muslim revolution in Senegambia."

(1996) The Cambridge illustrated history of the Islamic world. Cambridge University Press, ISBN 978-0521669931&lt;/ref&gt; Noted cases include the conversion of [[Samaritan]]s to Islam at the hands of the rebel Ibn Firāsa,&lt;ref&gt;M. Levy-Rubin,  "New evidence relating to the process of Islamization in Palestine in the Early Muslim Period – The Case of Samaria", in: ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient'', 43 (3), p. 257-276, 2000, [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fattal, A. (1958) ''Le statut légal des non-Musulman en pays d'Islam'', Beyrouth: Imprimerie Catholique, p. 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Arabs]] came to conquer [[Sindh]] under command of [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] in 711 CE. This was an easy task, as the people of Sindh had been practicing [[Buddhism]] and [[Hindu]] [[ahimsa]] (non-violence)[citation needed] for many years, and battle was sinful.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Robert I. Mesocosm: Hinduism and the Organization of a Traditional Newar City in Nepal. Berkeley: University of California Press, c1990 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab Muslims quickly destroyed the Sindhi forts and conquered Sindh. Many Hindus chose to flee Sindh and move to [[Punjab]] and [[Kutch]].&lt;ref name="Mcleod"&gt;''McLeod, John, "The History of India", Greenwood Press (2002), ISBN 0-313-31459-4, pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Those that stayed behind were asked to convert to Islam. For those that did not comply to this request, heavy taxes were levied on them and their properties were taken from them.&lt;ref name="mtholyoke"&gt;[http://www.mtholyoke.edu/~agha20e/polit116/musliminvasion.html Muslim Invasion]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jizya]] (poll tax) was the most important factor in the mass conversion to Islam, the tax paid by all non-Muslims ([[Dhimmis]]) in Islamic empires.&lt;ref&gt;  The Zakat is not collected from non-Muslims, but only from Muslims.They are exempt from duties of Islam like military service and zakat, instead they are required to pay jizyah (poll-tax). Historically some Islamic governments paid this poll tax for poor non-Muslim subjects or reduced it to mere symbolic tax. If the State cannot protect those who paid jizyah, then the amount they paid is returned to them.

{{See also|Devşirme|Christianity in the Ottoman Empire#Conversion|Safavid conversion of Iran from Sunnism to Shiism}}

A form of forced conversion became institutionalized during the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the practice of [[devşirme]], a human levy in which Christian boys were seized and collected from their families (usually in the Balkans), enslaved, converted to Islam, and then trained as elite military unit within the Ottoman army or for high-ranking service to the sultan.&lt;ref&gt;'''Conversion''', Tijana Krstić, ''Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire'', Ed. Gábor Ágoston and Bruce Alan Masters, (InfoBase Publishing, 2009), 145–146;"''As a part of their education, devşirme children underwent compulsory conversion to Islam, which is the only documented forced form of conversion organized by the Ottoman state.''".&lt;/ref&gt; From the mid to late 14th, through early 18th centuries, the [[devşirme]]–[[janissary]] system enslaved an estimated 500,000 to one million non–Muslim adolescent males.&lt;ref&gt;A.

There were conversions in the 12th century under the [[Almohad]] dynasty of North Africa and [[al-Andalus|Andalusia]], as well as in [[Persia]] under the [[Safavid]] dynasty where [[Sunni]]s were converted to [[Shi'ism]]&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Bernard (1984).

ISBN 0-691-00807-8&lt;/ref&gt; and Jews were converted to Islam.&lt;ref name="JadidAlIslam"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jaleh |last=Pirnazar |url=http://www.fis-iran.org/en/irannameh/volxix/mashhad-jewish-community |title=The "Jadid al-Islams" of Mashhad |work=[http://fis-iran.org/en Foundation for Iranian Studies] |location=Bethesda, MD, USA |publisher=[[Foundation for Iranian Studies]] |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is dispute amongst scholars as to whether the famous Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]] converted to Islam in order to freely escape from Almohad territory, and then reconverted back to Judaism in either the Levant or in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/the-great-rambam-joel-kramers-maimonides/86437/ |title=The Great Rambam: Joel Kraemer's 'Maimonides' – The New York Sun |publisher=Nysun.com |date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maimonides wrote a book on [[apostasy]] wherein he advocated accepting forced conversion rather than suffer martydom, and to then seek refuge afterward at a place where it was safe. The dispute also extended to the allegedly forced conversion of [[Sabbatai Zevi]], an Ottoman Jew from Smyrna. In reality, at the beginning of 1666, the [[Ottoman Sultan]] in [[Constantinople]] ordered Sabbatai, who had many followers and had claimed to be the long-awaited [[Jewish messiah]], to be imprisoned. When Sabbatai was later taken to Adrianople, the Sultan's physician, a former Jew, advised him to convert to Islam. The following day he converted before the Sultan, who happily rewarded Sabbatai by conferring the title (Mahmed) ''Effendi'', and appointing him as his doorkeeper with a high salary. A number of Sabbatai's followers also went over to Islam and about 300 families converted and were known as dönmeh (converts).&lt;ref name="tnr.com"&gt;[http://www.tnr.com/book/review/the-other-secret-jews?utm_source=TNR+Books+%26+Arts&amp;utm_campaign=4866964be0-TNR_BA_021810&amp;utm_medium=email Adam Kirsch, "The Other Secret Jews", review of Marc David Baer, ''The Dönme: Jewish Converts, Muslim Revolutionaries, and Secular Turks''], ''The New Republic'', Feb 15, 2010, accessed Feb 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone objecting to such allurement and conversions is harassed."&lt;ref&gt;Tundup Tsering and Tsewang Nurboo, in ''Ladakh visited'', Pioneer, 4/12/1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20000113/j&amp;k.htm#2 ''The Tribune'', Chandigarh, India – Jammu &amp; Kashmir&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pakistan====
The rise of [[Taliban]] insurgency in Pakistan has been an influential and increasing factor in the persecution of and discrimination against religious minorities, such as [[Hindus]], [[Christians]], [[Sikhs]], and other minorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/world/asia/militants-in-pakistan-make-inroads-in-the-diverse-and-tolerant-south.html?_r=0&amp;referrer= Extremists Make Inroads in Pakistan’]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Human Rights Council of Pakistan has reported that cases of forced conversion are increasing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/docid/51826ef842.html USCIRF Annual Report 2013 - Countries of Particular Concern: Pakistan]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca:8080/RIR_RDI/RIR_RDI.aspx?id=454343&amp;l=e Government Research Directorate, Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, Pakistan: Religious conversion, including treatment of converts and forced conversions (2009-2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 report says about 1,000 Christian and Hindu women in Pakistan are forcibly converted to Islam every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1,000 Christian, Hindu girls forced to convert to Islam every year in Pakistan: report|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/1000-christian-hindu-girls-forced-to-convert-to-islam-every-year-in-pakistan-report/1/353608.html|website=http://indiatoday.intoday.in|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reema|first1=Abbasititle|title=Pakistan needs a law to protect Hindus from forced conversion| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2601827/Pakistan-needs-law-protect-Hindus-forced-conversion.html |website=http://www.dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anwar|first1=Iqbal|title=1,000 minority girls forced in marriage every year: report|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1098452|website=http://www.dawn.com|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 a six year old Sikh girl was kidnapped by a member of the [[Afridi]] tribe in Northwest Frontier Province; he also claimed the girl had converted to Islam and therefore could not be returned to her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual Report on International Religious Freedom|year=2005|publisher=State Dept (US), Senate (US) Committee on Foreign Relations|page=667|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=04dlwzB2SvcC&amp;pg=PA667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, members of the Christian community of [[Charsadda]] in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North West Frontier Province]] of Pakistan, close to the border of [[Afghanistan]], reported that they had received letters threatening bombings if they did not convert to Islam, and that the police were not taking their fears seriously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,273075,00.html Report on Fox News, from AP]&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2009, [[International Christian Concern]] (ICC) reported the rape and killing of a Christian man in Pakistan, for refusing to convert to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,526126,00.html |title=Christian Man Raped, Murdered for Refusing to Convert to Islam, Family Says |publisher=FOX News |date=June 13, 2009 |author=Nora Zimmett|accessdate=June 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rinkle Kumari, a 19&amp;nbsp;year Pakistani student, Dr. Lata Kumari, and Asha Kumari, a Hindu working in a beauty parlor, were allegedly forced to convert from Hinduism to Islam.&lt;ref name="fridaytimesrinkle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefridaytimes.com/beta2/tft/article.php?issue=20120413&amp;page=9 |title=Opinion: Rinkle Kumari – the new Marvi of Sindh by Marvi Sirmed |publisher=Thefridaytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pakobserver.net/detailnews.asp?id=151043 |title=SC orders release of Rinkal Kumari, others |publisher=Pakobserver.net |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their cases were appealed all the way to the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] where they said that they wanted to live with their parents and not their 'so called' husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2012\04\19\story_19-4-2012_pg7_3 |title=Leading News Resource of Pakistan |publisher=Daily Times |date=2012-04-19 |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court issued a verdict that they should stay with their husbands.

====Somalia====
In August 2009, ICC reported that four [[Christians]] working to help orphans in [[Somalia]] were beheaded by Islamist extremists when they refused to convert to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,539129,00.html |title=Al Shabaab Reportedly Beheads 4 Christians, Rips Gold Teeth From Locals' Mouths |publisher=FOX News |date=August 12, 2009 |author= |accessdate=June 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
According to the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', in 2007, commissioner of police Sir [[Ian Blair]] stated the police were targeting extremist members of the Muslim community who were allegedly forcing vulnerable girls to convert to Islam in response to claims made by the Hindu Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Police protect girls forced to convert to Islam |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-437871/Police-protect-girls-forced-convert-Islam.html|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=19 August 2013|date=22 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 a Sikh girl's family claimed that she had been forcibly converted to Islam, and they received a police guard after being attacked by an armed gang, although the "Police said no one was injured in the incident".&lt;ref name=bm2007&gt;{{cite web|last=Cowan|first=Mark|title=Police guard girl 'forced to become Muslim' |url=http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/mail/news/tm_headline=police-guard-girl--forced-to-become-muslim-%26method=full%26objectid=19253457%26siteid=50002-name_page.html|publisher=Birmingham Mail|accessdate=19 August 2013|date=Jun 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these news stories, an open letter to Sir Ian Blair, signed by ten Hindu academics, argued that claims that Hindu and Sikh girls were being forcefully converted were "part of an arsenal of myths propagated by right-wing Hindu supremacist organisations in India".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pickledpolitics.com/archives/1045 |title=Where is the Hindu Forum’s evidence? |publisher=Pickled Politics |date=2007-03-13 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Muslim Council of Britain]] issued a press release pointing out there is a lack of evidence of any forced conversions and suggested it is an underhand attempt to smear the British Muslim population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcb.org.uk/media/presstext.php?ann_id=242 ]{{dead link|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An academic paper by Katy Sian published in the journal ''South Asian Popular Culture'' in 2011 explored the question of how "'forced' conversion narratives" arose around the [[Sikhism in the United Kingdom|Sikh diaspora in the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=Forced&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14746681003798060 | title = ‘Forced’ conversions in the British Sikh diaspora | first = Katy P. |last = Sian |date = 6 July 2011 | journal = South Asian Popular Culture | doi=10.1080/14746681003798060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sian, who reports that claims of conversion through courtship on campuses are widespread in the UK, indicates that rather than relying on actual evidence they primarily rest on the word of "a friend of a friend" or on personal [[anecdote]]. According to Sian, the narrative is similar to accusations of "[[Human trafficking|white slavery]]" lodged against the Jewish community and foreigners to the UK and the US, with the former having ties to [[anti-semitism]] that mirror the [[Islamophobia]] betrayed by the modern narrative. Sian expanded on these views in 2013's ''Mistaken Identities, Forced Conversions, and Postcolonial Formations''.&lt;ref name="Sian2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Katy P. Sian|title=Unsettling Sikh and Muslim Conflict: Mistaken Identities, Forced Conversions, and Postcolonial Formations|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-9AZ2atcd-kC&amp;pg=PA127|accessdate=15 June 2013|date=4 April 2013|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7391-7874-4|pages=55–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
