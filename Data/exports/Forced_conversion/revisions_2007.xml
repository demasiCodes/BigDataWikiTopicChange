A '''forced conversion''' is the conversion to a [[religion]] or philosophy under duress, with the threatened consequence of earthly penalties or harm. These consequences range from [[Unemployment|job loss]] and social isolation to [[incarceration]], [[torture]] or [[death]]. Typically, such a conversion entails the repudiation of former religious or philosophical convictions.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

==Buddhism==
{{Religious persecution}}
In Buddhism forced conversion is forbidden. However, there have been instances in history where forced conversions have occurred. In the Edo period of Japan, when the first Christian missionaries had arrived, Tokugawa Shogunate forced many newly-converted Japanese Christians to renounce their new faith via "fumie".  Those who refused were killed; however, some did survive in secret, and are called, "Kakure kirishitan".{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

==Christianity==

Christianity rejects the idea of forced conversion, as conversion is seen not as a external proclamations but internal beliefs ({{bibleref2|Romans|10:9-10|NKJV}}) {{Fact|date=October 2007}}. However, Christians have not always followed the New Testament mandate, which posed the question of how to deal with such conversions under duress. [[Pope Innocent III]], who denounced forced conversions, pronounced in 1201 that even if torture and intimidation had been employed, in receiving the sacrament one nevertheless: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;...does receive the impress of Christianity and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling. ... [For] the grace of Baptism had been received, and they had been anointed with the sacred oil, and had participated in the body of the Lord, they might properly be forced to hold to the faith which they had accepted perforce, lest the name of the Lord be blasphemed, and lest they hold in contempt and consider vile the faith they had joined.&lt;ref&gt;Grayzel, Solomon, ''The Church and the Jews in the Thirteenth Century'', rev. ed., New York: Hermon, 1966, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

During the 15th century, Jews in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] were frequently pressured into converting to Christianity, culminating in the establishment of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] to ensure the sincerity of conversions, the expulsion of Jews from [[Spain]] in [[1492]] and the forced conversion of Jews in [[Portugal]] in [[1497]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.home.earthlink.net/~benven/annivers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War II|Second World War]] [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Serbs]] where forcibly converted to [[Roman catholicism]] or murdered by the Croatian [[Ustaša]].

==Islam==
Islam forbids forced conversion, as surah {{cite quran|2|256|expand=no|style=nosup}} says "Let there be no compulsion in religion"&lt;ref&gt;Sir Thomas W. Arnold, ''The Preaching of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall G. Hodgson, ''The Venture of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Hourani, ''A History of the Arab Peoples''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ira Lapidus, ''History of Islamic Societies''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.S. Starorianos, ''A Global History, the Human Heritage''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karen Armstrong]] writes on forced conversions that after [[Muhammad]]'s death: nobody in the Islamic empire was forced to accept the Islamic faith.&lt;ref name="arm2"&gt;Armstrong, A History of God: from Abraham to the Present: the 4000-year Quest for God, 1993, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Levy-Rubin, despite being rejected by [[Islamic law]], cases of forced conversions such as of Ibn Firāsa against [[Samaritan]]s can be noticed under Islamic rule.&lt;ref&gt;M. Levy-Rubin,  "New evidence relating to the process of Islamization in Palestine in the Early Muslim Period - The Case of Samaria", in: ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient'', 43 (3), p. 257-276, 2000, [[Springer]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fattal, A.(1958) ''Le statut légal des non-Musulman en pays d'Islam'', Beyrouth: Imprimerie Catholique, p. 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt; Forced conversions played a role especially in the [[12th century]] under the [[Almohad]] dynasty of [[North Africa]] and [[al-Andalus|Andalusia]] as well as in [[Persia]] where [[Shi'a]] Islam is dominant.&lt;ref name="conseq"&gt;Lewis (1984), p. 17, 18, 94, 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twenty-first century allegations of forced conversion to Islam===

In 2001 the [[Indonesia]]n army evacuated hundreds of Christian refugees from the remote [[Kesui]] and [[Teor]] islands in [[Maluku]] province after the refugees said they had been forced to convert to Islam. It was reported that some of the men had been circumcised against their will, and a paramilitary group involved in the incident confirmed that circumcisions had taken place but denied any element of coercion.

In 2004 [[Coptic Christian]]s in [[Egypt]] for several days occupied the main Coptic cathedral in [[Cairo]], angry at the disappearance of the wife of a priest in a village in the [[Nile delta]] who was rumoured to have been forced to convert to Islam. The [[BBC]] reported that allegations of forced conversions of Copts to Islam surface every year in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Heba Saleh (BBC News, Cairo), 'Conversion' sparks Copt protest.

In August 2006 two journalists, [[Steve Centanni]] and [[Olaf Wiig]], were kidnapped by [[Holy Jihad Brigades]] in [[Gaza City]], and were apparently forced to convert to [[Islam]] at gunpoint. The Palestinian news service Ramattan and Fox News reported that they were released unharmed, shortly after a new video was released.&lt;ref name="Fox"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kidnapped Fox journalists released|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=August 27|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/27/fox.journalists/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the video, both journalists, wearing beige robes, read statements saying that they had converted to Islam, with Centanni stating "Islam is not just meant for some people; it is the true religion for all people at all times."&lt;ref name="Fox"/&gt;After being freed Steve Centanni stated "We were forced to convert to Islam at gunpoint, and don't get me wrong here, I have the highest respect for Islam, and learned a lot of very good things about it, but it was something we felt we had to do, because they had the guns, and we didn't know what the hell was going on."&lt;ref name="Fox"/&gt;

It was reported in February 2007 that Hindu and Sikh organisations in the UK believe that young women of these faiths are being coerced by young men they meet at university into converting to Islam. The chief of the [[Metropolitan Police]], [[Sir Ian Blair]] attended a conference where the allegations were made. A spokeswoman for the police said: "We are aware of it as an issue that concerns the Hindu community but are not aware, without further research, of any specific incidents reported to police. We would encourage anyone who has been targeted in this way to seek help.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article1464601.ece Times Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, members of the Christian community of [[Charsadda]] in the [[North West Frontier Province]] of [[Pakistan]], close to the border with [[Afghanistan]], reported receiving letters threatening bombings if they did not convert to Islam. They stated that the police were not taking their fears seriously. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,273075,00.html Report on Fox News, from AP]&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been numerous reports of Islamic attempts to forcibly convert religious minorities in Iraq.  In Baghdad, Christians have been told to convert to Islam, pay the jizya or die.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aina.org/news/20070518111715.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/05/08/opinion/edisaac.php]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/religionreport/stories/2007/1937124.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2007 the BBC reported that people in the [[Mandaean]] religious minority in [[Iraq]] alleged that they were being targeted by [[Islamist]] insurgents and being offered the choice of conversion or death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6412453.stm BBC News on-line 7 March 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;
