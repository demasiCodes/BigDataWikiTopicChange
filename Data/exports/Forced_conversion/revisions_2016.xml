Those who convert may willingly embrace their new religion or worldview, or may continue, covertly, with the beliefs and practices originally held, while outwardly maintaining the forms of the new religion or worldview. [[Crypto-Judaism|Crypto-Jews]], [[Crypto-Christianity|crypto-Christians]], [[Crypto-Islam|crypto-Muslims]] and [[Crypto-paganism|crypto-Pagans]] are historical examples of the latter.

== Religion and power ==
In general, [[anthropologists]] have shown that the relationship between [[religion and politics]] is complex, especially when viewed over the expanse of human history.&lt;ref name=Firth&gt;Firth, Raymond (1981) [http://www.jstor.org/stable/676754 Spiritual Aroma: Religion and Politics]. ''American Anthropologist'', New Series, Vol. 83, No. 3, pp. 582–601&lt;/ref&gt; While religious leaders and the state generally have different aims, both are concerned with power and order; both use reason and emotion to motivate behavior. Throughout history, leaders of religious and political institutions have cooperated, opposed one another, or attempted to co-opt each other, for purposes both noble and base, and have implemented programs with a wide range of driving values, from compassion aimed at alleviating current suffering to brutal change aimed at achieving longer-term goals, for the benefit of groups ranging from small cliques to all of humanity. The relationship is far from simple. But religion has often been used coercively, and has used coercion.&lt;ref name=Firth /&gt;

== Christianity ==
{{See also|Christianization}}
[[Early Christianity|Christianity]] was a minority religion during much of the [[Roman Empire]], and [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|the early Christians were persecuted during that time]]. When [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine I converted to Christianity]], it became the dominant religion in the Roman Empire. Already under the reign of Constantine I, Christian heretics had been persecuted; beginning in the late 4th century, the [[Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire|ancient pagan religions were also actively suppressed]]. In the view of many historians, the [[Constantinian shift]] turned Christianity from a persecuted religion into one capable of persecution and sometimes eager to persecute.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. John Coffey, ''Persecution and Toleration on Protestant England 1558–1689'', 2000, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; There are many examples of forced conversion throughout the history of Christianity: during the Roman Empire, in the Middle Ages, inquisitions in Spain and Goa, forced conversion of indigenous children, and against Hindus.

=== End of Roman Empire ===
In 392 Emperor [[Theodosius I]] decreed that [[Christianity]] was the only legal religion of the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire|forbade pagan practices]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is Our will that all the peoples who are ruled by the administration of Our Clemency shall practice that religion which the divine Peter the Apostle transmitted to the Romans.... The rest, whom We adjudge demented and insane, shall sustain the infamy of heretical dogmas, their meeting places shall not receive the name of churches, and they shall be smitten first by divine vengeance and secondly by the retribution of Our own initiative''" ([[Codex Theodosianus]] XVI 1.2.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/greece/paganism/paganism.html |title=Paganism and Rome |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Medieval era ===
During the [[Saxon Wars]], [[Charlemagne]], [[King of the Franks]], forcibly Roman Catholicized the [[Saxons]] from their native [[Germanic paganism]] by way of warfare, and law upon conquest. Examples are the [[Massacre of Verden]] in 782, when Charlemagne reportedly had 4,500 captive Saxons massacred upon rebelling against conversion, and the ''[[Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae]]'', a law imposed on conquered Saxons in 785 that prescribed death to those who refused to convert to Christianity.&lt;ref name="CHARLEMAGNE"&gt;For the Massacre of Verden, see Barbero, Alessandro (2004). ''Charlemagne: Father of a Continent'', page 46. [[University of California Press]]. For the ''Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae'', see Riché, Pierre (1993). ''The Carolingians''. [[University of Pennsylvania Press]]. ISBN 978-0-8122-1342-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Crusades'', by Bernard Hamilton, 1998, Sutton Publishing, United Kingdom, Chapter 9: Later Crusades, p. 87: "In 1309 the [[Teutonic Order]] moved its headquarters to Marienburg in Prussia. It had a papal license to wage perpetual war against the pagans and used this to launch annual crusades against [[Lithuania]]. These expeditions were very popular with the nobility of northern Europe: campaigns were held twice a year, in the summer and in the winter when the order laid on special Christmas festivities for visiting crusaders." "The excuse for men who enjoyed fighting and to lay waste large parts of Lithuania in the name of Christ was removed in 1386 when the [[King of Lithuania]], [[Jagiello]], married [[Queen Jadwiga of Poland]] and received Catholic baptism. The two kingdoms were united under Christian rulers and the Teutonic Knights no longer had any justification for crusading against pagans there."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Innocent III]] pronounced in 1201 that if one agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation, one nevertheless could be compelled to outwardly observe Christianity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ..."&lt;ref&gt;Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the end of the [[Al-Andalus|Islamic control of Spain]], Jews were [[Alhambra Decree|expelled]] from Spain in 1492 and from Portugal in 1497.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lowenstein |first=Steven |title=The Jewish Cultural Tapestry: International Jewish Folk Traditions |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=36 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=EWToS3VyqVMC&amp;dq=jewish+cultural+tapestry|isbn=9780195313604 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims [[Expulsion of Jews and Muslims from Portugal|were expelled]] from Portugal in 1497, and were gradually forced to convert in the constituent kingdoms of Spain. The forced conversion of Muslims was implemented in the [[Crown of Castile]] from 1500–02 and in the [[Crown of Aragon]] in the 1520s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harvey |first=L.

After the forced conversion, when all former Muslims and Jews had ostensibly became Catholic, the [[Spanish Inquisition]] targeted primarily forced converts from Judaism, who came under suspicion of either continuing to adhere to their old religion or having fallen back into it. Jewish conversos still resided in Spain and often practiced Judaism cryptically and were suspected by the "Old Christians" of being [[Crypto-Jew]]s. The Spanish Inquisition generated much wealth and income for the church and individual inquisitors by confiscating the property of the persecuted. The end of the [[Al-Andalus]] and the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion of the Sephardic Jews]] from the Iberian Peninsula went hand in hand with the increase of Spanish and Portuguese influence in the world, as exemplified in the Christian conquest of the Americas and their aboriginal Indian population. The Ottoman Empire and Morocco absorbed most of the Jewish refugees, although a large majority remained as Conversos.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110108184056/http://www.thejerusalemconnection.us/news-archive/tag/inquisition 3000 Years of Sephardic History], [[JerUSAlem Connection|Jerusalem Connection]] Writers' Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goa inquisition ===
{{Main|Goa Inquisition}}
The Portuguese practised religious persecution in [[Goa]], India in the 16th and 17th centuries. The natives of Goa, most of them Hindus, were subjected to [[Goa Inquisition|severe torture and oppression]] by the zealous Portuguese rulers and missionaries, and forcibly converted to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RS1uAAAAMAAJ Of umbrellas, goddesses, and dreams: essays on Goan culture and society] Robert Samuel Newman, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Goa Inquisition (book)|The Goa Inquisition, Being a Quatercentenary Commemoration Study of the Inquisition in India]] by Anant Priolkar, Bombay University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hSnn_kDUI6AC&amp;pg=PA69 Everyday Nationalism: Women of the Hindu Right in India] Kalyani Devaki Menon, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ftS1AAAAIAAJ Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bombay] 1967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.

In 1567, the campaign to destroy temples in [[Bardez]] met with success, with 300 Hindu temples destroyed. Prohibition was laid from December 4, 1567 on rituals of Hindu marriages, sacred thread wearing and cremation. All persons above 15 years of age were compelled to listen to Christian preaching, failing which they were punished. In 1583, Hindu temples at [[Assolna]] and [[Cuncolim]] were destroyed byh army action. "The fathers of the Church forbade the Hindus under terrible penalties the use of their own sacred books, and prevented them from all exercise of their religion. They destroyed their temples, and so harassed and interfered with the people that they abandoned the city in large numbers, refusing to remain any longer in a place where they had no liberty, and were liable to imprisonment, torture and death if they worshiped after their own fashion the gods of their fathers", wrote Filippo [[Sassetti]], who was in India from 1578 to 1588. An order was issued in June 1684 for suppressing the [[Konkani]] language and making it compulsory to speak Portuguese, on pain of severe penalties. All non-Christian cultural symbols and books written in local languages were also ordered to be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/28411503/Goa-Inquisition-for-Colonial-Disciplining |title=Goa Inquisition for Colonial Disciplining |publisher=Scribd.com |date=2010-03-15 |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hindus in India ===
Much more recently, the [[Tripura Baptist Christian Union|Baptist Church of Tripura]] is alleged to have supplied the [[NLFT]] with arms and financial support and to have encouraged the murder of Hindus, particularly infants, as a means to depopulate the region of all Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first =Subhir | last =Bhaumik |title = 'Church backing Tripura rebels'| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/717775.stm | publisher =BBC News |accessdate =2006-08-26  | date=April 18, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the ''[[Assam Times]]'' reported that about fifteen armed [[Hmar people|Hmar]] militants, members of the Manmasi National Christian Army, tried to force Hindu residents of Bhuvan Pahar, [[Assam]] to convert to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assamtimes.org/social/3112.html Christianity threat looms over Bhuvan Pahar] Assam Times – June 23, 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626130437/http://www.assamtimes.org/social/3112.html |date=June 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few Christian evangelists in India have been accused of forced conversion of Hindus or others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bosnewslife.com/12022-india-pastor-jailed-for-converting-hindus|title=BosNewsLife – Christian News Agency  » Blog Archive   » India Pastor Jailed For Converting Hindus, Corpse Exhumed|publisher=|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persecution.org/suffering/newsdetail.php?newscode=8289|title=India Christian Couple Detained On "Forced Conversion" Charges|publisher=|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judaism ==

Forced conversions occurred under the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean Kingdom]]. The [[Idumea]]ns were forced to convert to Judaism, by threat of exile or death, depending on the source.&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus Antiquities 13.257–258&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristobulus I|Aristobulus]]&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''Eusebíus, Christianity, and Judaism'', Harold W. Attridge  claims that "there is reason to think that Josephus' account of their conversion is substantially accurate." He also writes: "that these were not isolated instances, but that forced conversion was a national policy, is clear from the fact that [[Alexander Jannaeus]] (around 80 BCE) demolished the city of [[Pella, Jordan| Pella]] in [[Moab]], 'because the inhabitants would not agree to adopt the national custom of the Jews.'" Josephus, Antiquities. 13.15.4.&lt;ref&gt;Harold W. Attridge, Gōhei Hata (eds). ''Eusebius, Christianity, and Judaism'' Wayne State University Press, 1992: p. 387&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maurice Sartre]] has written of the "policy of forced Judaization adopted by [[John Hyrcanus|Hyrcanos]], [[Aristobulus I]] and [[Jannaeus]]", who offered "the conquered peoples a choice between expulsion or conversion,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Sartre]]. ''The Middle East Under Rome''. Harvard University Press, 2005: p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

William Horbury has written that "The evidence is best explained by postulating that an existing small Jewish population in Lower Galilee was massively expanded by the forced conversion in c.104 BCE of their Gentile neighbours in the north."&lt;ref&gt;William Horbury. ''The Cambridge History of Judaism 2 Part Set: Volume 3, The Early Roman Period'' Cambridge University Press, 1999: p. 599&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the [[BBC]] defended a claim that in 524 CE the [[Yemen]]i Jewish [[Himyar]] tribe, led by King [[Dhu Nuwas]], had offered Christian residents of a village in what is now Saudi Arabia the choice between conversion to Judaism or death, and that 20,000 Christians had then been massacred. The BBC stated that "The production team spoke to many historians over 18 months, among them [[Nigel Groom]], who was our consultant, and Professor [[Abdul Rahman Al-Ansary]] [former professor of archaeology at the [[King Saud University]] in [[Riyadh]]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/historians-back-bbc-over-jewish-massacre-claim |title=Historians back BBC over Jewish massacre claim &amp;#124; The Jewish Chronicle |publisher=Thejc.com |date=2009-09-18 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions documented by Yousef himself show the great pride he expressed after massacring more than 22,000 Christians in [[Zafar, Yemen|Zafar]] and [[Najran]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Ryckmans,La persécution des chrétiens himyarites au sixième siècle, Nederlands Historisch-Archaeologisch Inst. in het Nabije Oosten, 1956 pp 1-24&lt;/ref&gt;

A form of forced conversion became institutionalized during the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the practice of [[devşirme]], a human levy in which Christian boys were seized and collected from their families (usually in the Balkans), enslaved, converted to Islam, and then trained as elite military unit within the Ottoman army or for high-ranking service to the sultan.&lt;ref&gt;'''Conversion''', Tijana Krstić, ''Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire'', Ed.

There were conversions in the 12th century under the [[Almohad]] dynasty of North Africa and [[al-Andalus|Andalusia]]. Reports from the period describe that, after an initial 7-month grace period, the Almohads killed or forcefully converted Jewish communities in each new city they conquered until "there was no Jew left from [[Silves, Portugal|Silves]] to [[Mahdia]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ugr.es/~estsemi/miscelanea/57/3.Gallego.08,33-51.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Cases of mass martyrdom of Jews who refused to convert to Islam are also reported.{{citation needed|reason=No reference given|date=March 2016}} There is dispute amongst scholars as to whether the famous Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]] converted to Islam in order to freely escape from Almohad territory, and then reconverted back to Judaism in either the Levant or in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/the-great-rambam-joel-kramers-maimonides/86437/ |title=The Great Rambam: Joel Kraemer's 'Maimonides' – The New York Sun |publisher=Nysun.com |date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maimonides wrote a book on [[apostasy]] wherein he advocated accepting forced conversion rather than suffer martydom, and to then seek refuge afterward at a place where it was safe. The dispute also extended to the allegedly forced conversion of [[Sabbatai Zevi]], an Ottoman Jew from Smyrna. In reality, at the beginning of 1666, the [[Ottoman Sultan]] in [[Constantinople]] ordered Sabbatai, who had many followers and had claimed to be the long-awaited [[Jewish messiah]], to be imprisoned. When Sabbatai was later taken to Adrianople, the Sultan's physician, a former Jew, advised him to convert to Islam. The following day he converted before the Sultan, who happily rewarded Sabbatai by conferring the title (Mahmed) ''Effendi'', and appointing him as his doorkeeper with a high salary. A number of Sabbatai's followers also went over to Islam and about 300 families converted and were known as dönmeh (converts).&lt;ref name="tnr.com"&gt;[http://www.tnr.com/book/review/the-other-secret-jews?utm_source=TNR+Books+%26+Arts&amp;utm_campaign=4866964be0-TNR_BA_021810&amp;utm_medium=email Adam Kirsch, "The Other Secret Jews", review of Marc David Baer, ''The Dönme: Jewish Converts, Muslim Revolutionaries, and Secular Turks''], ''The New Republic'', Feb 15, 2010, accessed Feb 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

An academic paper by Katy Sian published in the journal ''South Asian Popular Culture'' in 2011 explored the question of how "'forced' conversion narratives" arose around the [[Sikhism in the United Kingdom|Sikh diaspora in the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=Forced&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14746681003798060 | title = ‘Forced’ conversions in the British Sikh diaspora | first = Katy P. |last = Sian |date = 6 July 2011 | journal = South Asian Popular Culture | doi=10.1080/14746681003798060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sian, who reports that claims of conversion through courtship on campuses are widespread in the UK, indicates that rather than relying on actual evidence they primarily rest on the word of "a friend of a friend" or on personal [[anecdote]]. According to Sian, the narrative is similar to accusations of "[[Human trafficking|white slavery]]" lodged against the Jewish community and foreigners to the UK and the US, with the former having ties to [[anti-semitism]] that mirror the [[Islamophobia]] betrayed by the modern narrative. Sian expanded on these views in 2013's ''Mistaken Identities, Forced Conversions, and Postcolonial Formations''.&lt;ref name="Sian2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Katy P.

Christopher Marsh, a professor at the [[Baylor University]] writes that "Tracing the social nature of religion from Schleiermacher and Feurbach to Marx, Engles, and Lenin...the idea of religion as a social product evolved to the point of policies aimed at the forced conversion of believers to atheism."&lt;ref name="Marsh2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marsh|first=Christopher|title=Religion and the State in Russia and China: Suppression, Survival, and Revival|accessdate=14 July 2016|date=20 January 2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|language=English|isbn=978-1-4411-0284-3|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Jonathan Blake of the Department of Political Science at [[Columbia University]] elucidates the history of this practice in the USSR, stating that:&lt;ref name="Blake2014" /&gt;
{{quote|God, however, did not simply vanish after the Bolshevik revolution. Soviet authorities relied heavily on coercion to spread their idea of scientific atheism. This included confiscating church goods and property, forcibly closing religious institutions and executing religious leaders and believers or sending them to the gulag. … Later, the United States passed the Jackson-Vanik amendment which harmed US-Soviet trade relations until the USSR permitted the emigration of religious minorities, primarily Jews.

Across Eastern Europe following World War II, the parts of the [[Nazi Empire]] conquered by the Soviet [[Red Army]], and Yugsolavia became one party Communist states and the project of coercive conversion continued.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hebblethwaite; Paul VI, the First Modern Pope; Harper Collins Religious; 1993; p.211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Vikiing; 2003; p.566 &amp; 568&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union ended its war time truce against the Russian Orthodox Church, and extended its persecutions to the newly Communist Eastern bloc: "In [[Polish anti-religious campaign|Poland]], Hungary, Lithuania and other Eastern European countries, Catholic leaders who were unwilling to be silent were denounced, publicly humiliated or imprisoned by the Communists. Leaders of the national Orthodox Churches in [[Religious persecution in Communist Romania|Romania]] and Bulgaria had to be cautious and submissive", wrote Blainey.&lt;ref name="Viking p.494"/&gt; While the churches were generally not as severely treated as they had been in the USSR, nearly all their schools and many of their churches were closed, and they lost their formally prominent roles in public life.

Yet some accounts suggest the conversion to militant atheism did not always end individuals’ existential questions. To begin with, many former believers joined and left several religious organizations prior to renouncing faith altogether. Their life history could not be simply divided into two halves. One man recounted having joined the Baptists, Pentecostals, and the Seventh-Day Adventists before abandoning religion. Another man had been an Old Believer, Baptist, Pentecostal, and Witness. In other words, many believers had spent time as non-believers, but found life without religious faith somehow unsatisfying. As a result, some former believers admitted to having previously left religious organizations, only to return to them later. Many of them noted how after publicly denouncing Protestantism, they continued to receive visits from their former religious leaders asking them to reconsider. Indeed, atheist propaganda sometimes included complaints that once a believer had been convinced to leave his faith, atheist agitators lost interest in him, viewing the case as resolved.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[French Revolution]], a [[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|campaign of dechristianization]] happened which included removal and destruction of religious objects from places of worship; English librarian [[Thomas Hartwell Horne]] and biblical scholar [[Samuel Davidson]] write that "churches were converted into 'temples of reason,' in which atheistical and licesntious homilies were substituted for the proscribed service".&lt;ref name="HorneDavidson2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horne|first1=Thomas Hartwell|last2=Davidson|first2=Samuel|title=An Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures|accessdate=21 July 2016|date=21 November 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=English |isbn=978-1-108-06772-0|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Latreille, A.

===East Asian Communism===

The emergence of Communist states across East Asia after World War Two saw religion purged by atheist regimes across China, North Korea and much of Indo-China.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.508&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, China became a Communist state under the leadership of [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[Communist Party of China]]. China itself had been a cradle of religious thought since ancient times, being the birthplace of [[Confucianism]] and [[Daoism]], and Buddhists having arrived in the first century AD. Under Mao, China became officially atheist, and though some religious practices were permitted to continue under State supervision, religious groups deemed a threat to order have been suppressed—as with Tibetan Buddhism from 1959 and [[Falun Gong]] in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/111803/China/258959/Altaic#toc258961 Encyclopedia Britannica Online - China: Religion]; accessed 10 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Religious schools and social institutions were closed, foreign missionaries expelled, and local religious practices discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.508&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Cultural Revolution]], Mao instigated "struggles" against the Four Olds: "old ideas, customs, culture, and habits of mind".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/111803/China/71854/Attacks-on-party-members Encyclopedia Britannica Online - China - History: Cultural Revolution]; accessed 10 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the Communist Party launched a three-year drive to promote atheism in Tibet, saying intensifying propaganda on atheism is "especially important for Tibet because atheism plays an extremely important role in promoting economic construction, social advancement and socialist spiritual civilization in the region".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/253345.stm China announces "civilizing" atheism drive in Tibet]; BBC; January 12, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the strict enforcement of anti-clerical laws, people in strongly [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] areas, especially the states of [[Jalisco]], [[Zacatecas]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Colima]] and [[Michoacán]], began to oppose him, and this opposition led to the [[Cristero War]] from 1926 to 1929, which was characterized by brutal atrocities on both sides.
