A '''forced conversion''' is the conversion to a [[religion]] or philosophy under duress, with the threatened consequence of earthly penalties or harm. These consequences range from [[Unemployment|job loss]] and social isolation to [[incarceration]], [[torture]] or [[death]]. Typically, such a conversion entails the repudiation of former religious or philosophical convictions.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

==Christianity==

[[Pope Innocent III]], who denounced forced conversions, pronounced in 1201 that even if torture and intimidation had been employed in receiving the sacrament, one nevertheless: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;...does receive the impress of Christianity and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling. ... [For] the grace of Baptism had been received, and they had been [[confirmation (sacrament)|anointed with the sacred oil]], and had [[eucharist|participated in the body of the Lord]], they might properly be forced to hold to the faith which they had accepted perforce, lest the name of the Lord be blasphemed, and lest they hold in contempt and consider vile the faith they had joined.&lt;ref&gt;Grayzel, Solomon, ''The Church and the Jews in the Thirteenth Century'', rev. ed., New York: Hermon, 1966, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The "[[New Christian]]s" were inhabitants of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] ([[Sephardi]]c Jews or [[Mudéjar]] Muslims) during the Middle Ages and the Early Modern Era who were baptized  under coercion, becoming [[Converso]]s or [[Morisco]]s. In spite of their new faith, they were suspected by the "Old Christians" of being [[Crypto-Jew]]s or [[crypto-Islam|Crypto-Muslim]]s. Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492 and from [[Portugal]] in 1497.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.home.earthlink.net/~benven/annivers.html 500 ANNIVERSARY OF THE FORCED CONVERSION OF THE JEWS OF PORTUGAL&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Religious Persecution took place by the Portuguese in [[Goa]], [[India]] from 16th to the 17th century. The natives of Goa were subjected to [[Goa Inquisition|severe torture and oppression]] by the zealous Portuguese rulers and missionaries. 

Additionally, the economic conquest of the [[Americas]] by various European forces coincided with and depended on forced conversion to undo indigenous culture resistant to assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance: [[Americanization (of Native Americans)]] &gt; [[Americanization_(of_Native_Americans)#Americanization_and_assimilation_.281880-1920.29|Americanization and assimilation (1880-1920)]] &gt; [[Americanization_(of_Native_Americans)#Suppression_of_Religion|Suppression of Religion]]&lt;/ref&gt;  

African slaves held in the Americas were also often forcibly converted to Christianity by their masters.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

[[Islam]]ic scripture and law forbids forced conversion.&lt;ref name="W53"&gt;Waines (2003) "An Introduction to Islam" ''Cambridge University Press''. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; A verse of the [[Qur'an]] ({{cite quran|2|256|expand=no|style=nosup}}) is frequently cited: "Let there be no compulsion in religion".&lt;ref&gt;Sir Thomas W. Arnold, ''The Preaching of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall G.

Starorianos, ''A Global History, the Human Heritage''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karen Armstrong]] asserts that after [[Muhammad]]'s death, nobody in the Islamic empire was forced to accept the Islamic faith.&lt;ref name="arm2"&gt;Armstrong, A History of God: from Abraham to the Present: the 4000-year Quest for God, 1993, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidences of forced conversion were rare in Islamic history.&lt;ref name="W53" /&gt;&lt;ref name="conseq"&gt;Lewis (1984), p. 17, 18, 94, 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Noted cases include the conversion of [[Samaritan]]s to Islam at the hands of the rebel Ibn Firāsa,&lt;ref&gt;M. Levy-Rubin,  "New evidence relating to the process of Islamization in Palestine in the Early Muslim Period - The Case of Samaria", in: ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient'', 43 (3), p. 257-276, 2000, [[Springer]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fattal, A.(1958) ''Le statut légal des non-Musulman en pays d'Islam'', Beyrouth: Imprimerie Catholique, p. 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt; conversions in the 12th century under the [[Almohad]] dynasty of [[North Africa]] and [[al-Andalus|Andalusia]], as well as in [[Persia]] under the [[Safawid]] dynasty where [[Sunni]]s were converted to [[Shi'ism]].&lt;ref name="conseq" /&gt;

In 2001 the [[Indonesia]]n army evacuated hundreds of Christian refugees from the remote [[Kesui]] and [[Teor]] islands in [[Maluku (province) ]] after the refugees stated that they had been forced to convert to Islam. According to reports, some of the men had been circumcised against their will, and a paramilitary group involved in the incident confirmed that circumcisions had taken place while denying any element of coercion. 
&lt;ref&gt;Maluku refugees allege forced circumcision, BBC News Online, Wednesday, 31 January, 2001 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1146224.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 [[Coptic Christian]]s in [[Egypt]] occupied the main Coptic cathedral in [[Cairo]] for several days, angry at the disappearance of a priest's wife in a village in the [[Nile delta]], who was rumoured to have been forced to convert to Islam. The [[BBC]] reported that allegations of forced conversions of Copts to Islam surface every year in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Heba Saleh (BBC News, Cairo), 'Conversion' sparks Copt protest.

In August 2006 two journalists, [[Steve Centanni]] and [[Olaf Wiig]], were kidnapped by [[Holy Jihad Brigades]] in [[Gaza City]], and were apparently forced to convert to [[Islam]] at gunpoint. The Palestinian news service Ramattan and Fox News reported that they were released unharmed shortly after the release of a new video.&lt;ref name="Fox"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kidnapped Fox journalists released|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=August 27|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/27/fox.journalists/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the video, both journalists, wearing beige robes, read statements saying that they had converted to Islam, with Centanni stating "Islam is not just meant for some people; it is the true religion for all people at all times."&lt;ref name="Fox"/&gt; After being freed, Steve Centanni stated, "We were forced to convert to Islam at gunpoint, and don't get me wrong here, I have the highest respect for Islam, and learned a lot of very good things about it, but it was something we felt we had to do, because they had the guns, and we didn't know what the hell was going on."&lt;ref name="Fox"/&gt;

It was reported in February 2007 that Hindu and Sikh organisations in the UK believe that young women of these faiths are being coerced by young men they meet at university into converting to Islam. The chief of the [[Metropolitan Police]], [[Sir Ian Blair]] attended a conference where the allegations were made. A spokeswoman for the police said: "We are aware of it as an issue that concerns the Hindu community but are not aware, without further research, of any specific incidents reported to police. We would encourage anyone who has been targeted in this way to seek help."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article1464601.ece Times Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, members of the Christian community of [[Charsadda]] in the [[North West Frontier Province]] of [[Pakistan]], close to the border of [[Afghanistan]], reported that they had received letters threatening bombings if they did not convert to Islam, and that the police were not taking their fears seriously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,273075,00.html Report on Fox News, from AP]&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been numerous reports of Islamic attempts to forcibly convert religious minorities in Iraq.  In Baghdad, Christians have been told to convert to Islam, pay the [[jizya]] or die.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aina.org/news/20070518111715.htm Told to Convert or Die, 21 Assyrian Families Seek Shelter in Baghdad Churches&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/05/08/opinion/edisaac.php The assault on Assyrian Christians - International Herald Tribune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/religionreport/stories/2007/1937124.htm The Religion Report - 30 May 2007 - Christian Minorities in the Islamic Middle East : Rosie Malek-Yonan on the Assyrians&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2007 the BBC reported that people in the [[Mandaean]] religious minority in [[Iraq]] alleged that they were being targeted by [[Islamist]] insurgents, who offered them the choice of conversion or death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6412453.stm BBC News on-line 7 March 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[October]] [[2009]] it was reported that Muslim groups in the [[India]]n state of [[Kerala]] have been engaging in a "[[Love Jihad]]", whereby [[Muslim]] men were trained to [[seduce]] college-going [[Hindu]] and [[Christian]] girls to marry them and forcibly convert to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Love-Jihad-racket-VHP-Christian-groups-find-common-cause/articleshow/5117548.cms]&lt;/ref&gt;. Both Hindu and Catholic Christian groups in the state expressed alarm at this trend and have been working together to protest this trend. The [[High Court]] in the state has resolved to probe the matter. The primary Islamic group currently being held responsible for this is the [[Islamic extremist]] front [[Popular Front of India]], a conglomeration of radical Islamist groups disguised as civil rights groups that are dedicated to implementing [[Islam]]ic [[Sharia]] law in Hindu majority India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/kerala-hc-wants-probe-into-love-jihad/523630/]&lt;/ref&gt;. The Catholic Church in Kerala has joined up with Hindu groups in order to combat this trend.&lt;ref name="ucanews.com"&gt;[http://www.ucanews.com/2009/10/13/church-state-concerned-about-love-jihad/]&lt;/ref&gt;. Such cases of "Love Jihad" have reportedly started to occur in the neighboring state of [[Karnataka]] as well.&lt;ref name="ucanews.com"/&gt;
