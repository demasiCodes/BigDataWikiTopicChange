{{Discrimination sidebar |expanded=Manifestations}}
'''Forced conversion''' is the adoption of a different [[religion]] or the adoption of [[irreligion]] under [[Coercion|duress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=International Standards on Freedom of Religion or Belief |url=https://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/freedomreligion/pages/standards.aspx#3 |website=Human Rights |publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Someone who has been forced to convert to a different religion or irreligion may continue, covertly, to adhere to the beliefs and practices which were originally held, while outwardly behaving as a convert. [[Crypto-Judaism|Crypto-Jews]], [[Crypto-Christianity|crypto-Christians]], [[Crypto-Islam|crypto-Muslims]] and [[Crypto-paganism|crypto-Pagans]] are historical examples of the latter.

== Religion and power ==
In general, [[anthropologists]] have shown that the relationship between [[religion and politics]] is complex, especially when viewed over the expanse of human history.&lt;ref name=Firth&gt;Firth, Raymond (1981) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/676754 Spiritual Aroma: Religion and Politics]. ''American Anthropologist'', New Series, Vol. 83, No. 3, pp. 582–601&lt;/ref&gt; While religious leaders and the state generally have different aims, both are concerned with power and order; both use reason and emotion to motivate behavior. Throughout history, leaders of religious and political institutions have cooperated, opposed one another, and or attempted to co-opt each other, for purposes which are both noble and base, and they have implemented programs with a wide range of driving values, from compassion which is aimed at alleviating current suffering to brutal change which is aimed at achieving long-term goals, for the benefit of groups ranging from small cliques to all of humanity. The relationship is far from simple. But religion has often been used coercively, and it has also used coercion.&lt;ref name=Firth/&gt;

== Buddhism ==
People may express their faith through the act of taking [[refuge in Buddhism|refuge]], and conversions usually require a recital of accepting the Triple Gems of Buddhism. However, they may always practice Buddhism without fully abandoning their own religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebuddhagarden.com/how-convert-buddhism.html|title=How to Convert to Buddhism - the Buddha Garden}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chin Human Rights Organisation (CHRO), Christians from the [[Chin people|Chin ethnic minority group]] in [[Myanmar]] are facing coercion to convert to Buddhism by state actors and programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title='Threats to Our Existence': Persecution of Ethnic Chin Christians in Burma|url=https://burmacampaign.org.uk/media/Threats_to_Our_Existence.pdf|publisher=Chin Human Rights Organisation|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Christianity ==
{{See also|Christianization|Classical antiquity}}
[[Early Christianity|Christianity]] was a [[minority religion]] during much of the middle [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Classical antiquity|Classical Period]], and [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|the early Christians were persecuted during that time]]. When [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Constantine I converted to Christianity]], it had already grown to be the dominant religion of the Roman Empire. Already under the reign of Constantine I, [[Heresy#Christianity|Christian heretics]] were being persecuted; beginning in the late 4th century, the [[Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire|ancient pagan religions were also actively suppressed]]. In the view of many historians, the [[Constantinian shift]] turned Christianity from a persecuted religion into a religion which was capable of persecuting and sometimes eager to persecute.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. John Coffey, ''Persecution and Toleration on Protestant England 1558–1689'', 2000, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 February 380, together with [[Gratian]] and [[Valentinian II]], [[Theodosius I]] issued the decree ''Cunctos populos'', the so-called [[Edict of Thessalonica]], recorded in the [[Codex Theodosianus]] [[:la:s:Codex Theodosianus – Liber XVI#I.2|xvi.1.2]]. This declared [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] [[Nicene Christianity]] to be the only legitimate imperial religion and the only one entitled to call itself [[Catholic (term)|Catholic]]. Other Christians he described as "foolish madmen".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/theodcodexvi.asp|title=Internet History Sourcebooks Project|website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also ended official state support for the traditional [[polytheist]] religions and customs.&lt;ref name="KaylorPhillips2012"&gt;{{citation|author1=Noel Harold Kaylor|author2=Philip Edward Phillips|title=A Companion to Boethius in the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B_secKlFKB0C&amp;pg=PA14|access-date=19 January 2013|date=3 May 2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-18354-4|pages=14–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]'' (Eng. Theodosian Code) was a compilation of the [[Roman law|laws]] of the [[Roman Empire]] under the [[Christians|Christian]] emperors since 312. A commission was established by [[Theodosius II]] and his [[Tetrarchy|co-emperor]] [[Valentinian III]] on 26 March 429&lt;ref name=Oxf&gt;"Codex Theodosianus" in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium|The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], New York &amp; Oxford, 1991, p. 475. {{ISBN|0195046528}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Codex_Theodosianus.html|title=LacusCurtius • Roman Law — Theodosian Code (Smith's Dictionary, 1875)|website=penelope.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the compilation was published by a constitution of 15 February 438.

=== Medieval western Europe ===
During the [[Saxon Wars]], [[Charlemagne]], [[King of the Franks]], forcibly converted the [[Saxons]] from their native [[Germanic paganism]] by way of warfare, and law upon conquest. Examples are the [[Massacre of Verden]] in 782, when Charlemagne reportedly had 4,500 captive Saxons massacred for rebelling,&lt;ref name="Barbero2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alessandro Barbero|title=Charlemagne: Father of a Continent|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QON8DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46|date=23 February 2018|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-29721-0|pages=46–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae]]'', a law imposed on conquered Saxons in 785, after another rebellion and destruction of churches and killing of missionary priests and monks,&lt;ref name="Frassetto2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Frassetto|title=The Early Medieval World: From the Fall of Rome to the Time of Charlemagne &amp;#91;2 Volumes&amp;#93;|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6feKDfRM9sYC&amp;pg=PA489|date=14 March 2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-996-7|pages=489–}}&lt;/ref&gt; that prescribed death to those who refused to convert to Christianity.&lt;ref name="CHARLEMAGNE"&gt;For the Massacre of Verden, see Barbero, Alessandro (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Forced conversion that occurred after the seventh century generally took place during riots and massacres carried out by mobs and clergy without support of the rulers. In contrast, royal persecutions of Jews from the late eleventh century onward generally took the form of expulsions, with some exceptions, such as conversions of Jews in southern Italy of the 13th century, which were carried out by Dominican Inquisitors but instigated by King [[Charles II of Naples]].&lt;ref name=soyer/&gt;

Jews were forced to convert to Christianity by the Crusaders in Lorraine, on the Lower Rhine, in Bavaria and Bohemia, in Mainz and in Worms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Abraham Joshua Heschel |author2=Joachim Neugroschel |author3=Sylvia Heschel|title=Maimonides: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ki6a7WsZYwMC&amp;pg=PA43|page=43|publisher=Macmillan|year=1983|isbn=9780374517595}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Rhineland massacres]], [[Worms massacre (1096)]]).

[[Pope Innocent III]] pronounced in 1201 that if one agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation, one nevertheless could be compelled to outwardly observe Christianity:&lt;ref&gt;Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the [[Northern Crusades]] against the pagan Balts and Slavs of [[northern Europe]], forced conversions were a widely used tactic, which received papal sanction.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 71&lt;/ref&gt; These tactics were first adopted during the [[Wendish Crusade]], but became more widespread during the [[Livonian Crusade]] and [[Prussian Crusade]], in which tactics included the killing of hostages, massacre, and the devastation of the lands of tribes that had not yet submitted.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the populations of these regions were converted only after the repeated rebellion of native populations that did not want to accept Christianity even after initial forced conversion; in Old Prussia, the tactics employed in the initial conquest and subsequent conversion of the territory resulted in the death of most of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] consequently became extinct.&lt;ref&gt;''The German Hansa'', P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

After the forced conversion, when all former Muslims and Jews had ostensibly become Catholic, the [[Spanish Inquisition]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] targeted primarily forced converts from Judaism and Islam, who came under suspicion of either continuing to adhere to their old religion or having fallen back into it. Jewish conversos still resided in Spain and often practised Judaism secretly and were suspected by the "Old Christians" of being Crypto-Jews. The Spanish Inquisition generated much wealth and income for the church and individual inquisitors by confiscating the property of the persecuted. The end of [[Al-Andalus]] and the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion of the Sephardic Jews]] from the Iberian Peninsula went hand in hand with the increase of Spanish and Portuguese influence in the world, as exemplified in the Christian conquest of the Americas and their aboriginal Indian population. The [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Morocco]] absorbed most of the Jewish and Muslim refugees, although a large majority remained as Conversos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108184056/http://www.thejerusalemconnection.us/news-archive/tag/inquisition |title=3000 Years of Sephardic History |website=The Jerusalem Connection, International |url=http://www.thejerusalemconnection.us/news-archive/tag/inquisition |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 January 2011 |last=Neese |first=Shelley |date=17 November 2008 |access-date=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial Americas=== 
During the [[European colonization of the Americas]], forced conversion of the continents' indigenous, non-Christian population was common, especially in [[South America]] and [[Mesoamerica]], where the conquest of large indigenous polities like the [[Inca]] and [[Aztec]] Empires placed colonizers in control of large non-Christian populations. According to some South American leaders and indigenous groups, there were cases among native populations of conversion under the threat of violence, often because they were compelled to after being conquered, and that the Catholic Church cooperated with civil authority to achieve this end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fisher |first1=Ian |title=Pope Concedes Unjustifiable Crimes in Converting South Americans |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/24/world/americas/24pope.html |website=New York Times |date=May 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century the pagan populations of the [[Baltics]] faced campaigns of forcible conversion by crusading knight corps such as the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] and the [[Teutonic Order]], which often meant simply dispossessing these populations of their lands and property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ef2cAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48|title=Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland|publisher=Britannica Educational Publishing|page=48|isbn=9781615309917|date=2013-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Latvia: A Short History|author=Mara Kalnins|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vHpeCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT55|page=55|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=9781849046060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goa inquisition ===
{{Main|Goa Inquisition}}
The Portuguese carried out the [[Christianisation of Goa]] in India in the 16th and 17th centuries. The majority of the natives of Goa had converted to Christianity by the end of the 16th century. The Portuguese rulers had implemented state policies encouraging and even rewarding conversions among [[Hindu]] subjects. The rapid rise of converts in Goa was mostly the result of Portuguese economic and political control over the Hindus, who were vassals of the Portuguese crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Mendonça|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Mh3kKf0VSfQC&amp;pg=PA397#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true 397]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1567, the conversion of the majority of the native villagers to Christianity allowed the Portuguese to destroy temples in [[Bardez]], with 300 Hindu temples destroyed. Prohibitions were then declared from December 4, 1567, on public performances of Hindu marriages, sacred thread wearing and cremation. All persons above 15 years of age were compelled to listen to Christian preaching, failing which they were punished. In 1583, Hindu temples at [[Assolna]] and [[Cuncolim]] were also destroyed by the Portuguese army after the majority of the native villagers there had also converted to Christianity.&lt;ref name="Machado"&gt;{{cite book

=== Jizya and conversion ===

According to [[Bat Ye'or|Ye'or]], upon payment of the ''[[jizya]]'' tax, the ''[[dhimmi]] (jizya paying resident of Islamic state or country)'' would receive a receipt of payment, either in the form of a piece of paper or parchment or as a seal humiliatingly placed upon their neck, and was thereafter compelled to carry this receipt wherever he went within the realms of Islam. Failure to produce an up-to-date ''jizya'' receipt on the request of a Muslim could result in death or forced conversion to Islam of the ''dhimmi'' in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yeʼor|first1=B|title=The decline of Eastern Christianity under Islam|date=2011|publisher=Madison, NJ: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jews and Christians were required to pay the ''jizyah'' while pagans depending on the four [[Madhhab]]s were either required to accept Islam, pay the jizya, be exiled, or be killed.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Islam |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Islam |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |location=New York |date=17 August 2021|access-date=12 January 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010649/http://www.islam-qa.com/index.php?ref=34770&amp;ln=eng] - Islam Q&amp;A (Archived), Fatwa No. 34770&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians believe that forced conversion was rare in Islamic history,&lt;ref name="W53"&gt;Waines (2003) "An Introduction to Islam" ''Cambridge University Press''. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bonner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ira"&gt;{{cite book|title=Islamic Societies to the Nineteenth Century: A Global History|author=Ira M.

Lapidus|Ira Lapidus]] points towards "interwoven terms of political and economic benefits and of a sophisticated culture and religion" as appealing to the masses. He writes that:&lt;blockquote&gt;The question of why people convert to Islam has always generated the intense feeling. Earlier generations of European scholars believed that conversions to Islam were made at the point of the sword, and that conquered peoples were given the choice of conversion or death. It is now apparent that conversion by force, while not unknown in Muslim countries, was, in fact, rare. Muslim conquerors ordinarily wished to dominate rather than convert, and most conversions to Islam were voluntary. (...) In most cases, worldly and spiritual motives for conversion blended together. Moreover, conversion to Islam did not necessarily imply a complete turning from an old to a totally new life. While it entailed the acceptance of new religious beliefs and membership in a new religious community, most converts retained a deep attachment to the cultures and communities from which they came.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Islamic Societies|publisher=Ira M.

Instead, they only allowed them (non-[[People of the Book|Ahle-Kitab]]) to avoid death by choosing to convert to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress|volume=9|title=Political conditions of the Hindus under the Khaljis|publisher=[[Indian History Congress]]|author=Kishori Saran Lal|pages= 232|author-link=Kishori Saran Lal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the [[Madhhab|four schools of Islamic jurisprudence]], the [[Hanafi]] and [[Maliki]] schools allow polytheists to be granted ''[[dhimmi]]'' status, except [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|Arab polytheists]].

[[Wael Hallaq]] states that in theory, Islamic religious tolerance only applied to those religious groups that [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] considered to be monotheistic "People of the Book", i.e. Christians, Jews, and Sabians if they paid the ''jizya'' tax, while to those excluded from the "People of the Book" were only offered two choices: convert to Islam or fight to the death. In practice, the "People of the Book" designation and ''dhimmi'' status were even extended to the non-monotheistic religions of the conquered peoples, such as [[Hinduism|Hindus]], [[Jainism|Jains]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], and other non-monotheists.&lt;ref name=hallaq&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eVJsAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA327|author=Wael B.

A well-known classical scholar, Allama Badr al-Din al-Aini (1360–1453), writes in his commentary on Sahih al-Bukhari:&lt;blockquote&gt;Hazrat Abu Bakr al-Siddiq fought those who refused to pay Zakat because they had taken up the sword and started a war against the Muslim community … Hazrat Abu Hanifa took the ground that he who refuses to pay Zakat must neither be killed nor even fought. However, he must be forced to pay it without the use of the sword, and must only be killed if he rose up to attack.

In the 17th century, [[Sabbatai Zevi]], a [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic Jew]] whose ancestors were welcomed in the Ottoman Empire during the [[Spanish Inquisition]], proclaimed himself as the [[List of Jewish messiah claimants|Jewish Messiah]] and called for the abolition of major Jewish laws and customs. After [[Sabbateans|he attracted a large following]], he was arrested by the Ottoman authorities and given a choice between execution or conversion to Islam.&lt;ref name="JE 1906"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13480-shabbethai-zebi-b-mordecai |title=Shabbetai Ẓevi |last1=Kohler |first1=Kaufmann |last2=Malter |first2=Henry |author1-link=Kaufmann Kohler |author2-link=Henry Malter |encyclopedia=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]] |publisher=[[Kopelman Foundation]] |year=1906 |access-date=6 October 2020 |quote=At the command [of the sultan], Shabbetai was now taken from [[Abydos (Hellespont)|Abydos]] to [[Edirne|Adrianople]], where the sultan's physician, a former Jew, advised Shabbetai to embrace Islam as the only means of saving his life. Shabbetai realized the danger of his situation and adopted the physician's advice. On the following day [...] being brought before the sultan, he cast off his Jewish garb and put a Turkish turban on his head; and thus his conversion to Islam was accomplished. The sultan was much pleased, and rewarded Shabbetai by conferring on him the title (Mahmed) "Effendi" and appointing him as his doorkeeper with a high salary. [...] To complete his acceptance of Mohammedanism, Shabbetai was ordered to [[Polygyny in Islam|take an additional wife]], a Mohammedan [[Slavery in Islam|slave]], which order he obeyed. [...] Meanwhile, Shabbetai secretly continued his plots, playing a double game. At times he would assume the role of a pious Mohammedan and revile Judaism; at others he would enter into relations with Jews as one of their own faith. Thus in March, 1668, he gave out anew that he had been filled with the [[Holy Spirit in Judaism|Holy Spirit]] at [[Passover]] and had received a revelation. He, or one of [[Sabbateans|his followers]], published a mystic work addressed to the Jews in which the most fantastic notions were set forth, e.g., that he was the true Redeemer, in spite of his conversion, his object being to bring over thousands of Mohammedans to Judaism. To the sultan he said that his activity among the Jews was to bring them over to Islam. He therefore received permission to associate with his former coreligionists, and even to preach in their synagogues. He thus succeeded in bringing over a number of Mohammedans to his [[Kabbalah|cabalistic views]], and, on the other hand, in converting many Jews to Islam, thus forming a Judæo-Turkish sect (see [[Dönmeh]]), whose followers implicitly believed in him [as the [[Messiah in Judaism|Jewish Messiah]]]. This double-dealing with Jews and Mohammedans, however, could not last very long. Gradually the Turks tired of Shabbetai's schemes. He was deprived of his salary, and banished from Adrianople to [[Constantinople]]. In a village near the latter city he was one day surprised while [[Psalms|singing psalms]] in a tent with Jews, whereupon the grand vizier ordered his banishment to [[Dulcigno]], a small place in [[Albania under the Ottoman Empire|Albania]], where he died in loneliness and obscurity.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zevi opted for a feigned conversion solely to escape the death penalty,&lt;ref name="JE 1906"/&gt; and [[Crypto-Judaism|continued to believe and practice Judaism]] along with [[Dönmeh|his followers]] in secrecy.&lt;ref name="JE 1906"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |title=Judaism – The Lurianic Kabbalah: Shabbetaianism |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Judaism/The-Lurianic-Kabbala#ref35335 |date=23 January 2020 |access-date=6 October 2020 |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] |location=[[Edinburgh]] |quote=Rabbi [[Sabbatai Zevi|Shabbetai Tzevi]] of [[İzmir|Smyrna]] (1626–76), who [[List of Jewish messiah claimants|proclaimed himself messiah]] in 1665. Although the “messiah” was [[#Islam|forcibly converted to Islam]] in 1666 and ended his life in exile 10 years later, he continued to have [[Sabbateans|faithful followers]]. A sect was thus born and survived, largely thanks to the activity of [[Nathan of Gaza]] (c. 1644–90), an unwearying propagandist who justified the actions of Shabbetai Tzevi, including his final apostasy, with theories based on the [[Lurianic Kabbalah|Lurian doctrine of “repair”]]. Tzevi’s actions, according to Nathan, should be understood as the descent of the just into the abyss of the “shells” in order to liberate the captive particles of divine light. The Shabbetaian crisis lasted nearly a century, and some of its aftereffects lasted even longer. It led to the formation of sects whose members were externally converted to Islam—e.g., the Dönme (Turkish: “Apostates”) of [[Thessaloniki|Salonika]], whose descendants still live in [[Turkey]]—or to [[Roman Catholicism]]—e.g., the [[Frankism|Polish supporters]] of [[Jacob Frank]] (1726–91), the self-proclaimed messiah and [[Conversion to Christianity#Catholicism|Catholic convert]] (in [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1648–1867)|Bohemia-Moravia]], however, the Frankists outwardly remained Jews).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tnr.com"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Kirsch |first=Adam |author-link=Adam Kirsch |date=15 February 2010 |title="The Other Secret Jews", review of Marc David Baer, ''The Dönme: Jewish Converts, Muslim Revolutionaries, and Secular Turks'' |url=http://www.tnr.com/book/review/the-other-secret-jews |magazine=[[The New Republic]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |access-date=6 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217043805/http://www.tnr.com/book/review/the-other-secret-jews |archive-date=17 February 2010 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantine historian [[Doukas (historian)|Doukas]] recounts two other cases of forced or attempted forced conversion: one of a Christian official who had offended Sultan [[Murad II]], and the other of an archbishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Byzantium Between the Ottomans and the Latins: Politics and Society in the Late Empire|author=Nevra Necipoğlu|pages=142–143|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780521877381|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=li2hX2RqSlcC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 57 Hindus converted in [[Pasrur]] during May 14–19.

An academic paper by Katy Sian published in the journal ''South Asian Popular Culture'' in 2011 explored the question of how "'forced' conversion narratives" arose around the [[Sikhism in the United Kingdom|Sikh diaspora in the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=Forced&gt;{{cite journal | title = 'Forced' conversions in the British Sikh diaspora | first=Katy P. |last=Sian |date=2011 |journal = South Asian Popular Culture |volume=9 |issue=2 | pages=115–130 |doi=10.1080/14746681003798060| s2cid=54174845 | url=https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/forced-conversions-in-the-british-sikh-diaspora(f4ec8dd2-198c-434c-b284-7f1562ae6d02).html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sian, who reports that claims of conversion through courtship on campuses are widespread in the UK, indicates that rather than relying on actual evidence they primarily rest on the word of "a friend of a friend" or on personal [[anecdote]]. According to Sian, the narrative is similar to accusations of "[[Human trafficking|white slavery]]" lodged against the Jewish community and foreigners to the UK and the US, with the former having ties to [[anti-semitism|antisemitism]] that mirror the [[Islamophobia]] betrayed by the modern narrative. Sian expanded on these views in 2013's ''Mistaken Identities, Forced Conversions, and Postcolonial Formations''.&lt;ref name="Sian2013"&gt;{{cite book|first=Katy P. |last=Sian |title=Unsettling Sikh and Muslim Conflict: Mistaken Identities, Forced Conversions, and Postcolonial Formations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-9AZ2atcd-kC&amp;pg=PA55 |access-date=15 June 2013|date=2013|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7391-7874-4|pages=55–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judaism ==
Forced conversions occurred under the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean Kingdom]]. The [[Idumea]]ns were forced to convert to Judaism, by threat of exile or death, depending on the source.&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus Antiquities 13.257–258&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristobulus I|Aristobulus]]&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''Eusebíus, Christianity, and Judaism'', [[Harold W. Attridge]] claims that "there is reason to think that [[Josephus]]' account of their conversion is substantially accurate." He also writes: "that these were not isolated instances, but that forced conversion was a national policy, is clear from the fact that [[Alexander Jannaeus]] (around 80 BC) demolished the city of [[Pella, Jordan|Pella]] in [[Moab]], 'because the inhabitants would not agree to adopt the national custom of the Jews.'" Josephus, Antiquities. 13.15.4.&lt;ref&gt;Harold W. Attridge, Gōhei Hata (eds). ''Eusebius, Christianity, and Judaism'' Wayne State University Press, 1992: p. 387&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maurice Sartre]] has written of the "policy of forced Judaization adopted by [[John Hyrcanus|Hyrcanos]], [[Aristobulus I]] and [[Jannaeus]]", who offered "the conquered peoples a choice between expulsion or conversion,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Sartre]]. ''The Middle East Under Rome''. Harvard University Press, 2005: p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; William Horbury has written that "The evidence is best explained by postulating that an existing small Jewish population in Lower Galilee was massively expanded by the forced conversion in c.104 BC of their Gentile neighbours in the north."&lt;ref&gt;William Horbury. ''The Cambridge History of Judaism 2 Part Set: Volume 3, The Early Roman Period'' Cambridge University Press, 1999: p. 599&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[BBC]] defended a claim that in AD 524 the [[Yemen]]i Jewish [[Himyar]] tribe, led by King Yusuf [[Dhu Nuwas]], had offered Christian residents of a village in what is now [[Saudi Arabia]] the choice between conversion to Judaism or death, and that 20,000 Christians had then been massacred. The BBC stated that "The production team spoke to many historians over 18 months, among them [[Nigel Groom]], who was our consultant, and Professor [[Abdul Rahman Al-Ansary]] [former professor of archaeology at the [[King Saud University]] in [[Riyadh]]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2009-09-18|title=Historians back BBC over Jewish massacre claim &amp;#124; The Jewish Chronicle|url=https://www.thejc.com/news/uk/historians-back-bbc-over-jewish-massacre-claim-1.11404|access-date=2014-06-06|publisher=Thejc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions documented by Yousef himself show the great pride he expressed after massacring more than 22,000 Christians in [[Zafar, Yemen|Zafar]] and [[Najran]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Ryckmans, La persécution des chrétiens himyarites au sixième siècle, Nederlands Historisch-Archaeologisch Inst. in het Nabije Oosten, 1956 pp 1–24&lt;/ref&gt;

Christopher Marsh, a professor at [[Baylor University]] writes that "Tracing the social nature of religion from Schleiermacher and Feurbach to Marx, Engels, and Lenin... the idea of religion as a social product evolved to the point of policies aimed at the forced conversion of believers to atheism."&lt;ref name="Marsh2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marsh|first=Christopher|title=Religion and the State in Russia and China: Suppression, Survival, and Revival|date=20 January 2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|language=en|isbn=978-1-4411-0284-3|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Jonathan Blake of the Department of Political Science at [[Columbia University]] elucidates the history of this practice in the USSR, stating that:&lt;ref name="Blake2014" /&gt;

{{blockquote|God, however, did not simply vanish after the Bolshevik revolution. Soviet authorities relied heavily on coercion to spread their idea of scientific atheism.

Leaders of the national Orthodox Churches in [[Anti-religious campaign of Communist Romania|Romania]] and Bulgaria had to be cautious and submissive", wrote Blainey.&lt;ref name="Viking p.494"/&gt; While the churches were generally not as severely treated as they had been in the USSR, nearly all their schools and many of their churches were closed, and they lost their formerly prominent roles in public life.

Yet some accounts suggest the conversion to militant atheism did not always end individuals' existential questions. To begin with, many former believers joined and left several religious organizations prior to renouncing faith altogether. Their life history could not be simply divided into two halves. One man recounted having joined the Baptists, Pentecostals, and the Seventh-Day Adventists before abandoning religion. Another man had been an Old Believer, Baptist, Pentecostal, and Witness. In other words, many believers had spent time as non-believers, but found life without religious faith somehow unsatisfying. As a result, some former believers admitted to having previously left religious organizations, only to return to them later. Many of them noted how after publicly denouncing Protestantism, they continued to receive visits from their former religious leaders asking them to reconsider. Indeed, atheist propaganda sometimes included complaints that once a believer had been convinced to leave his faith, atheist agitators lost interest in him, viewing the case as resolved.&lt;!--|language=English--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles 3, 5, 24, 27, and 130 of the [[Constitution of Mexico|Mexican Constitution of 1917]] as originally enacted were [[Anti-clericalism|anticlerical]] and enormously restricted religious freedoms.&lt;ref name="lawreview.byu.edu"&gt;Soberanes Fernandez, Jose Luis, [http://lawreview.byu.edu/archives/2002/2/Sob12.pdf Mexico and the 1981 United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019110819/http://lawreview.byu.edu/archives/2002/2/Sob12.pdf |date=2012-10-19 }}, pp. 437–438 nn. 7–8, BYU Law Review, June 2002&lt;/ref&gt; At first the anticlerical provisions were only sporadically enforced, but when President [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] took office, he enforced the provisions strictly.&lt;ref name="lawreview.byu.edu" /&gt; Calles' Mexico has been characterized as an atheist state&lt;ref&gt;Haas, Ernst B., [https://books.google.com/books?id=ldKJ_Re6p8AC&amp;pg Nationalism, Liberalism, and Progress: The dismal fate of new nations], Cornell Univ.

All religions had their properties expropriated, and these became part of government wealth.

The Constitution of 1917 also closed and forbade the existence of monastic orders (article 5), forbade any religious activity outside of church buildings (now owned by the government), and mandated that such religious activity would be overseen by the government (article 24).&lt;ref name="ilstu.edu" /&gt;

Due to the strict enforcement of anti-clerical laws, people in strongly [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] areas, especially the states of [[Jalisco]], [[Zacatecas]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Colima]] and [[Michoacán]], began to oppose him, and this opposition led to the [[Cristero War]] from 1926 to 1929, which was characterized by brutal atrocities on both sides. Some Cristeros applied terrorist tactics, while the Mexican government persecuted the clergy, killing suspected Cristeros and supporters and often retaliating against innocent individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Plutarco_Elias_Calles.aspx Calles, Plutarco Elías] The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001–05 Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 28, 1926, Calles was awarded a medal of merit from the head of Mexico's Scottish rite of Freemasonry for his actions against the Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.storialibera.it/epoca_contemporanea/messico_1926-1929/articolo.php?id=508 The Cristeros: 20th century Mexico's Catholic uprising, from The Angelus, January 2002, Volume XXV, Number 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903020244/http://www.storialibera.it/epoca_contemporanea/messico_1926-1929/articolo.php?id=508 |date=2009-09-03 }} by Olivier LELIBRE, [[The Angelus (magazine)|The Angelus]]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tabasco]] state, the so-called "[[Red Shirts (Mexico)|Red Shirts]]" began to act.

A truce was negotiated with the assistance of U.S. Ambassador [[Dwight Whitney Morrow]].&lt;ref name="Blood-Drenched Altars"&gt;{{citation |last=Van Hove |first=Brian |date=1996 |title=Blood-Drenched Altars: Baltimore's Archbishop Michael Joseph Curley, Oklahoma's Bishop Francis Clement Kelley and the Mexican Affair: 1934–1936 |publisher=[[Eternal Word Television Network]] |url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMELIBR/FR94204.TXT |access-date=9 May 2017 |archive-date=9 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109012114/http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMELIBR/FR94204.TXT |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calles, however, did not abide by the terms of the truce – in violation of its terms, he had approximately 500 Cristero leaders and 5,000 other Cristeros shot, frequently in their homes in front of their spouses and children.&lt;ref name="Blood-Drenched Altars" /&gt; Particularly offensive to Catholics after the supposed truce was Calles' insistence on a complete state monopoly on education, suppressing all Catholic education and introducing "socialist" education in its place: "We must enter and take possession of the mind of childhood, the mind of youth".&lt;ref name="Blood-Drenched Altars"/&gt; The persecution continued as Calles maintained control under his [[Maximato]] and did not relent until 1940, when President [[Manuel Ávila Camacho]], a believing Catholic, took office.&lt;ref name="Blood-Drenched Altars" /&gt; This attempt to indoctrinate the youth in atheism was begun in 1934 by amending Article 3 to the [[Mexican Constitution]] to eradicate religion by mandating "socialist education", which "in addition to removing all religious doctrine" would "combat fanaticism and prejudices", "build[ing] in the youth a rational and exact concept of the universe and of social life".&lt;ref name="lawreview.byu.edu" /&gt; In 1946 this "socialist education" was removed from the constitution and the document returned to the less egregious generalized secular education.
The effects of the war on the Church were profound.
