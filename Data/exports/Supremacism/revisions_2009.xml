'''Supremacism''' is the belief that a particular [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[religion]], [[gender]], [[species]], [[sexual orientation]], [[Belief|belief system]] or [[culture]] is superior to others and entitles those who identify with it to dominate, control or rule those who do not. Examples include supremacism based on [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] or [[Anthropology|anthropological]] origins ([[white supremacy]], [[black supremacy]], [[ethnocentrism]]), [[human sexuality|sexuality]] (male supremacy, female supremacy, heterosexual supremacy/[[hetereosexism]]), [[Sentience#Science fiction|sentience]] ([[human supremacy]], [[alien supremacy]]), thought process (organic supremacy, machine supremacy) and [[religion]] (see below).

Racial supremacy differs from [[racism]] in that, racism is the dislike or disrespect for a particular ethnic group. Racial Supremacy is the belief that one's own race is superior, dominant, chosen, smarter, more civilized, or more productive than any other race. Following the development of theories such as [[evolution]] and the philosophy of [[eugenics]], supremacists have sought [[Science|scientific]] justification for their views through notions such as [[Social Darwinism]]. Some supremacists believe in a hierarchy of races, in which certain races are more or less evolved than others.  White supremacists believe they are more evolved than blacks, while certain Asians (particularly those of East Asian descent) believe they are the most superior race, based on factors such as [[IQ]], educational attainment, low rates of crime and violence, and wealth (e.g., the [[model minority]], cognitive elitism).

== Historical examples ==
[[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazism|Nazi]] Party was perhaps the best-known and documented organization in history with fundamental principles of racial supremacy. They believed in the establishment of an [[Aryan#Racist connotations|Aryan]] empire throughout [[Europe]] and [[Russia]], where all people who were not of the Proto-European (Aryan) [[master race]] were to be below them. 

Following the [[American Civil War]], southern whites and former [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]] formed the secret society known as the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. They preached Anglo Protestant supremacy over all other races, as well as over [[Jew]]s and [[Catholic]]s.

During the first part of the [[Shōwa era]], the propaganda of the [[Empire of Japan]] used the old concept of [[hakko ichiu]] to support the idea that the [[Yamato people|Yamato]] was a superior race, destined to rule Asia and the Pacific. Many documents such as ''[[Kokutai no Hongi]]'', ''[[Shinmin no Michi]]'' and ''[[An Investigation of Global Policy with the Yamato Race as Nucleus]]'' referred to this concept of racial supremacy. 

Certain sectors of the Jamaican-born religion of [[Rastafarianism]] preach the supremacy of the black race and the need for an Exodus back to Africa ([[Ethiopia]]).

Both academics and alleged [[antisemitism|antisemites]] describe "Jewish supremacism," especially related to [[Israel]] and [[Zionism]]. Author Minna Rozen describes the 17th century Jews of Jerusalems’ view of themselves as a unique and elite group among Jews as “supremacism.”&lt;ref&gt;Minna Rozen, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=Pt50fMlgKuMC&amp; Jewish identity and society in the seventeenth century: reflections on the life and work of Refael Mordekhai Malki],''  Mohr Siebeck, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Pt50fMlgKuMC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=Jewish+Supremacism&amp;ei=G5IJSri3DIPIyAThjdTfDg&amp; 129], 1992 ISBN 3161457706, 9783161457708&lt;/ref&gt; Former Israeli and professor of history [[Ilan Pappé]] writes that the [[First Aliyah]] to Israel "established a society based on Jewish supremacy."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ilan Pappé]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=JzfgvSiUt9QC The Israel/Palestine question], [http://books.google.com/books?id=JzfgvSiUt9QC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=Jewish+Supremacy&amp;ei=ap0JSqfSH56GyATI4_SRAw 89], 1999 ISBN 041516947X, 9780415169479&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Columbia University]] associate professor [[Joseph Massad]] holds that "Jewish supremacism" always has been a "dominating principle" of religious and secular Zionism.&lt;ref&gt;David Hirsch, [http://www.yale.edu/yiisa/workingpaper/hirsh/David%20Hirsh%20YIISA%20Working%20Paper1.pdf Anti-Zionism and Antisemitism: Cosmopolitan Reflections], The Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Antisemitism Working Paper Series; discussion of [[Joseph Massad]]'s "The Ends of Zionism: Racism and the Palestinian Struggle", Interventions, Volume 5, Number 3, 2003, 440-451, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Joseph Massad's [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/mealac/faculty/massad/ "Response to the Ad Hoc Grievance Committee Report1"] on his [[Columbia University]] web site during a 2002 rally he said "Israeli Jews will continue to feel threatened if they persist in supporting Jewish supremacy." Massad notes there that others have misquoted him as saying Israel was a “Jewish supremacist and racist state.”  See for example David Horowitz, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=CYqZjtVp00AC&amp; The professors: the 101 most dangerous academics in America],'' Regnery Publishing, [http://books.google.com/books?id=CYqZjtVp00AC&amp;pg=PA271&amp;dq=“Jewish+supremacist+and+racist+state”&amp;num=100&amp;ei=N6UJSuDoCYPuzQSs5MXyBw&amp; 271], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Musician, writer and former Israeli [[Gilad Atzmon]] labels the ideology he calls “Jewishness” as "very much a supremacist, racist tendency."&lt;ref&gt;Jim Gilchrest interview with [[Gilad Atzmon]], [http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/features/39I-thought-music-could-heal.3804991.jp?CommentPage=1&amp;CommentPageLength=1000 I thought music could heal the wounds of the past.
