'''Supremacism''' is an [[ideology]] which holds that a particular class of people is [[superior (hierarchy)|superior]] to others, and that it should dominate, control, and subjugate others, or is entitled to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/supremacist|title=Supremacist|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supposed ''superior'' class of people can be an [[age]], [[race]] (classification of human beings) [[species]], [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], [[gender]] ([[social construct]]), [[sexuality]], [[language]], [[social class]], [[ideology]], [[nation]], or [[culture]], or any other part of a population.

Some [[Feminism|feminist]] theorists have argued that in [[patriarchy]], a standard of male supremacism is enforced through a variety of cultural, political, and interpersonal strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Reeves Sanday,  ''Female power and male dominance: on the origins of sexual inequality,'' Cambridge University Press, 1981, [https://books.google.com/books?id=39ScGl-T3J0C&amp;pg=PA6 pp. 6–8], [https://books.google.com/books?id=39ScGl-T3J0C&amp;pg=PA113 113–14], [https://books.google.com/books?id=39ScGl-T3J0C&amp;pg=PA174 174], [https://books.google.com/books?id=39ScGl-T3J0C&amp;pg=PA182 182]. {{ISBN|0-521-28075-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-28075-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 19th century there have been a number of feminist movements opposed to male supremacism, usually aimed at achieving equal legal rights and protections for women in all cultural, political and interpersonal relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= |title=Collins Dictionary and Thesaurus |year=2006 |publisher=Collins |location=London |isbn=0-00-722405-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Humm, Maggie |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Modern feminisms: Political, Literary, Cultural |year=1992 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-231-08072-7 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cornell&gt;{{cite book |author=Cornell, Drucilla |authorlink=Drucilla Cornell|title=At the heart of freedom: feminism, sex, and equality |year=1998 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J. |isbn=978-0-691-02896-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Centuries of European colonialism in the Americas, Africa, Australia, Oceania, and Asia were justified by [[white supremacist]] attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Takashi Fujitani, Geoffrey Miles White, Lisa Yoneyama,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ltm9hv0_4A0C ''Perilous memories: the Asia-Pacific War(s)''], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ltm9hv0_4A0C&amp;pg=PA303 p. 303], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 19th century, the phrase "[[The White Man's Burden]]", referring to the thought that whites have the obligation to make the societies of the other peoples more 'civilized', was widely used to justify imperialist policy as a noble enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Miller, Stuart Creighton| title= Benevolent Assimilation: The American Conquest of the Philippines, 1899–1903 | publisher= Yale University Press | year=1982 | isbn=0-300-03081-9}} p. 5: "...imperialist editors came out in favor of retaining the entire archipelago (using) higher-sounding justifications related to the "white man's burden."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Opinion archive, International Herald Tribune| title=In Our Pages: 100, 75 and 50 Years Ago; 1899: Kipling's Plea | journal=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=February 4, 1999 | volume= | issue= | pages= 6 | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1999/02/04/edold.t_10.php }}: Notes that Rudyard Kipling's new poem, "The White Man's Burden", "is regarded as the strongest argument yet published in favor of expansion."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Carlyle]], known for his historical account of the French Revolution, ''[[The French Revolution: A History]],'' which inspired [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]],'' argued that European supremacist policies were justified on the grounds they provided the greatest benefit to "inferior" native peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cruel.org/econthought/texts/carlyle/carlodnq.html | title=Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even at the time of its publication in 1849, Carlyle's main work on the subject, the ''[[Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question]],'' was received poorly by his contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cruel.org/econthought/texts/carlyle/negroquest.html | title=Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[American Civil War]], the [[Confederate States of America]] was founded with a constitution that contained clauses restricting the government's ability to limit or interfere with the institution of "negro" slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_csa.asp | title=Constitution of the Confederate States | date=March 11, 1861 }}: "No bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law denying or impairing the right of property in negro slaves shall be passed."&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Cornerstone Speech]], Confederate vice president [[Alexander H. Stephens|Alexander Stephens]] declared that one of the Confederacy's foundational tenets was [[white supremacy]] over black slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/cornerstone-speech/ | title="Corner Stone" Speech | author=[[Alexander H. Stephens|Alexander Stephens]] | date=March 21, 1861 }}: "Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its corner- stone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition."&lt;/ref&gt; Following the war, a secret society, the [[Ku Klux Klan]], was formed in the South. Its purpose was to "restore" white supremacy after the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] period, even though there still was white, Protestant supremacy in the United States, at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877,'' Perennial (HarperCollins), 1989, pp. 425–26.&lt;/ref&gt; The group preached supremacy over all other races, as well as supremacy over [[Jews]], [[Catholic]]s, and other minorities.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

[[Cornel West]], an African-American philosopher, writes that [[Black supremacist]] religious views arose in America as part of [[Nation of Islam|black Muslim]] theology in response to [[white supremacism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cornel West]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=p89c2eTJgJgC Race Matters]'', Beacon Press, 1993, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p89c2eTJgJgC&amp;pg=PA99 p. 99]: "The basic aim of [[Nation of Islam|black Muslim]] theology—with its distinct black supremacist account of the origins of white people—was to counter white supremacy."&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 20th century until the end of [[World War II]], known as the pre-1945 [[Shōwa era|''Shōwa'' era]], in Japan, the propaganda of the [[Empire of Japan]] used the old concept of ''[[hakko ichiu]]'' to support the idea that the [[Yamato people|Yamato]] were a superior race, destined to rule Asia and the Pacific. Many documents, such as ''[[Kokutai no Hongi]],'' ''[[Shinmin no Michi]],'' and ''[[An Investigation of Global Policy with the Yamato Race as Nucleus]],'' discussed this concept of Japanese supremacy.

In Africa, black Southern [[Sudan]]ese allege that they are subjected to a racist form of [[Arab supremacy]], which they equate with the historic white supremacism of South African [[apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theworld.org/2011/02/racism-in-sudan/ | title=Racism in Sudan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alleged [[genocide]] in the ongoing [[War in Darfur]] has been described as an example of [[Arab]] [[racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bnaibrith.ca/prdisplay.php?id=605 |title=Welcome To B'nai Brith |publisher=Bnaibrith.ca |date=2004-08-04 |accessdate=2010-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919002351/http://bnaibrith.ca/prdisplay.php?id=605 |archivedate=2010-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Asia, ancient Indians considered all foreigners as [[barbarian]]s. The Muslim scholar [[Al-Biruni]] wrote that the Indians called foreigners impure.&lt;ref name="The First Spring p.313"&gt;''The First Spring: The Golden Age of India'' by Abraham Eraly p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; A few centuries later, Dubois observes that "Hindus look upon Europeans as barbarians totally ignorant of all principles of honour and good breeding... In the eyes of a Hindu, a Pariah ([[Dalit|outcaste]]) and a European are on the same level."&lt;ref name="The First Spring p.313"/&gt; The Chinese viewed the Europeans as repulsive, ghost-like creatures, and even devils. The Chinese writers also referred to the Europeans as barbarians.&lt;ref&gt;''The Haunting Past: Politics, Economics and Race in Caribbean Life'' by Alvin O. Thompson p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
{{main articles|Völkisch movement|White supremacy#Germany}}
From 1933–1945, [[Nazi Germany]], under the rule of [[Adolf Hitler]], promoted the idea of a superior, [[Aryan race|Aryan]] ''[[Herrenvolk]]'', or [[master race]]. The [[Nazi propaganda|state's propaganda]] advocated the belief that [[Germanic peoples]], whom they called "Aryans", were a master race or a ''Herrenvolk'' that was superior to the [[Jews]], [[Slavs]], and [[Romani people]], so-called "gypsies". [[Arthur de Gobineau]], a French racial theorist and aristocrat, blamed the fall of the [[Ancien Régime|ancien régime]] in France on racial intermixing, which he argued had destroyed the purity of the Nordic race. Gobineau's theories, which attracted a strong following in Germany, emphasized the existence of an irreconcilable polarity between Aryan and Jewish cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Blamires, Cyprian; Jackson, Paul. ''World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia:'' Volume 1. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, Inc, 2006. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious==

===Christian===
Some academics and writers claim that [[Christian]] supremacism was a motivation for the [[Crusades]] in the [[Holy Land]], as well as for crusades against [[Muslim]]s and [[pagan]]s throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Lansing, Edward D. English, ''A companion to the medieval world,'' Volume 7, John Wiley and Sons, 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ecpGCF8-XCkC&amp;pg=PA457 p. 457], {{ISBN|1-4051-0922-X}}, 9781405109222&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Atlantic slave trade]] has been attributed in part to Christian supremacism as well.&lt;ref&gt;Mary E. Hunt, Diann L. Neu, ''New Feminist Christianity: Many Voices, Many Views,'' SkyLight Paths Publishing, 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HxU8716h2VgC&amp;pg=PA122 p. 122], {{ISBN|1-59473-285-X}}, 9781594732850&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ku Klux Klan]] has been described as a [[white supremacist]] Christian organization, as are many other white supremacist groups, such as the [[Posse Comitatus (organization)|Posse Comitatus]] and the [[Christian Identity]] and [[Positive Christianity]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;R. Scott Appleby, ''The ambivalence of the sacred: religion, violence, and reconciliation'', Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict series, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8RqbMGvsz5MC&amp;pg=PA103 p. 103], {{ISBN|0-8476-8555-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8476-8555-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = PublicEye.org - The Website of Political Research Associates|url = http://www.publiceye.org/rightwoo/rwooz9-07.html|website = www.publiceye.org|accessdate = 2015-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muslim===
Some academics and writers also allege Muslim or [[Islamic]] supremacism. Others claim that the [[Qur'an]] and other Islamic documents always speak of tolerant, protective beliefs, which have been misused, misquoted, and misinterpreted by both [[Islamic extremists]] and [[Islamophobia|Islamophobes]].&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Cohen, Ian Lague, Khaled Abou El Fadl, ''The place of tolerance in Islam,'' Beacon Press, 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fMCMR68rNxQC&amp;pg=PA23 p. 23], {{ISBN|0-8070-0229-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8070-0229-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of how supremacists have exploited the name of Islam include the Muslim participation in the [[African slave trade]], the early 20th century [[pan-Islamism]] promoted by [[Abdul Hamid II]],&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Jenkins, ''Political Islam in Turkey: running west, heading east?,'' Macmillan, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=c8VtheVUlfgC&amp;pg=PA60 p. 59],  {{ISBN|1-4039-6883-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4039-6883-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[jizya]] and rules of marriage in Muslim countries being imposed on non-Muslims,&lt;ref&gt;Malise Ruthven, ''Islam: a very short introduction,'' Oxford University Press, 1997, Macmillan, 2008 [https://books.google.com/books?ei=IkyMTPbhFsGB8gbVtZjnCg&amp;ct=result&amp;id=BL_rG9gIq64C&amp;dq=Islamic+supremacism&amp;q=Islamic+supremacism#search_anchor p. 117], {{ISBN|0-19-950469-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-950469-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the majority Muslim interpretations of the rules of pluralism in [[Malaysia]], and "defensive" supremacism practiced by some Muslim immigrants in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Bassam Tibi, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1754-9469.2010.01038.x/full Ethnicity of Fear? Islamic Migration and the Ethnicization of Islam in Europe], [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] online, June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers posit that Islam, unlike other religions, positively commands its adherents to impose its [[sharia|religious law]] on all peoples, believers and unbelievers alike, whenever possible and by any means necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Jewish===
Some academics and writers allege [[Judaism|Jewish]] supremacism, often in relation to [[Israel]] and [[Zionism]]. Author Minna Rozen writes that 17th century Jews who lived in Jerusalem were supremacist in their views that they were superior over other Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Minna Rozen, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Pt50fMlgKuMC&amp; Jewish identity and society in the seventeenth century: reflections on the life and work of Refael Mordekhai Malki],''  Mohr Siebeck, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Pt50fMlgKuMC&amp;pg=PA129 129], 1992 {{ISBN|3-16-145770-6}}, {{ISBN|978-3-16-145770-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ilan Pappé]], an Israeli historian, writes that the [[First Aliyah]] to Israel "established a society based on Jewish supremacy."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ilan Pappé]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=JzfgvSiUt9QC The Israel/Palestine question], [https://books.google.com/books?id=JzfgvSiUt9QC&amp;pg=PA89 89], 1999 {{ISBN|0-415-16947-X}}, 9780415169479&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Massad]], a Professor of Arab Studies, holds that "Jewish supremacism" always has been a "dominating principle" in religious and secular Zionism.&lt;ref&gt;David Hirsch, [http://www.yale.edu/yiisa/workingpaper/hirsh/David%20Hirsh%20YIISA%20Working%20Paper1.pdf Anti-Zionism and Antisemitism: Cosmopolitan Reflections] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011202833/http://www.yale.edu/yiisa/workingpaper/hirsh/David%20Hirsh%20YIISA%20Working%20Paper1.pdf |date=2008-10-11 }}, The Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Antisemitism Working Paper Series; discussion of [[Joseph Massad]]'s "The Ends of Zionism: Racism and the Palestinian Struggle", Interventions, Volume 5, Number 3, 2003, 440–51, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Joseph Massad]]'s [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/mealac/faculty/massad/ "Response to the Ad Hoc Grievance Committee Report1"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913023411/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/mealac/faculty/massad/ |date=2006-09-13 }} on his [[Columbia University]] web site during a 2002 rally he said "Israeli Jews will continue to feel threatened if they persist in supporting Jewish supremacy." Massad notes there that others have misquoted him as saying Israel was a "Jewish supremacist and racist state."  See for example David Horowitz, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CYqZjtVp00AC&amp; The professors: the 101 most dangerous academics in America],'' Regnery Publishing, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CYqZjtVp00AC&amp;pg=PA271 271], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Defamation League]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Duke: Ideology|url=http://archive.adl.org/learn/ext_us/david_duke/ideology.html|website=ADL.org|publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Southern Poverty Law Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Renaissance|url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/groups/american-renaissance|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; condemn writings about "Jewish Supremacism" by [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust-denier]], former [[Grand Wizard]] of the KKK, and [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorist]], [[David Duke]], as [[antisemitic]] – in particular, his book: ''[[Jewish Supremacism: My Awakening to the Jewish Question]].''&lt;ref&gt;Duke, David.
