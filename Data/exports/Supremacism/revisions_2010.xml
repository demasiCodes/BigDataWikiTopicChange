'''Supremacism''' is the belief that a particular [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[religion]], [[gender]], [[sexual orientation]], [[Belief|belief system]] or [[culture]] is superior to others and entitles those who identify with it to dominate, control or rule those who do not.

== Sexual ==

Many anthropologists consider male supremacism, also known as “male dominance” or “[[patriarchy]]”, to exist in all cultures throughout human history. Under it special rights or status is granted to men, i.e. "[[male privilege]]." Such supremacy is enforced through a variety of cultural, political and interpersonal strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Reeves Sanday,  ''Female power and male dominance: on the origins of sexual inequality,'' Cambridge University Press, 1981, [http://books.google.com/books?id=39ScGl-T3J0C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22male+dominance%22++%22male+supremacism%22&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=8#v=onepage&amp;q=%22male%20supremacism%22&amp;f=false p. 6-8, 113-114, 174, 182]. ISBN 0521280753, 9780521280754&lt;/ref&gt;  Others note that this often has been balanced by various forms of female authority.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Reeves Sanday, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 19th century there have been a number of  [[feminist]] movements opposed to male supremacism and working for equal legal rights and protections for women in all cultural, political and interpersonal relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= |title=Collins Dictionary and Thesaurus |year=2006 |publisher=Collins |location=London |isbn=0-00-722405-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Humm, Maggie |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Modern feminisms: Political, Literary, Cultural |year=1992 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-231-08072-7 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cornell&gt;{{cite book |author=Cornell, Drucilla |authorlink=Drucilla Cornell|title=At the heart of freedom: feminism, sex, and equality |year=1998 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J. |isbn=978-0-691-02896-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Middle Ages]] [[Crusades]] have been described as an example of white supremacist colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;Angeliki E. Laiou, Roy P.

Following the [[American Civil War]], southern white veterans of the [[Confederate States of America]] formed the secret society known as the [[Ku Klux Klan]] to restore white supremacy after the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877,'' Perennial (HarperCollins), 1989, p. 425-426.&lt;/ref&gt; They preached supremacy over all other races, as well as over [[Jew]]s, [[Catholic]]s and other minorities.

[[Black supremacy]] arose in America as a counter to [[white supremacism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Cornel|last=West|authorlink=Cornel West|year=1993|title=Race Matters|chapter= 8|pages=95–105|publisher=Beacon Press|url=http://www.pragmatism.org/library/west/|isbn=0679749861}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups advocating some version of it include [[Nation of Islam]], the [[New Black Panther Party]], the [[Black Hebrew Israelites]] and the [[Mansions of Rastafari|Bobo Shanti]] section of the [[Rastafari movement]].

During the early 20th century until the end of [[World War II]] - the [[Shōwa era]] - the propaganda of the [[Empire of Japan]] used the old concept of [[hakko ichiu]] to support the idea that the [[Yamato people|Yamato]] was a superior race, destined to rule Asia and the Pacific. Many documents such as ''[[Kokutai no Hongi]]'', ''[[Shinmin no Michi]]'' and ''[[An Investigation of Global Policy with the Yamato Race as Nucleus]]'' referred to this concept of racial supremacy. 

During the 1930s and 1940s [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Germany|German]] [[Nazism|Nazi]] Party preached the existence of an [[Aryan#Racist connotations|Aryan]] [[master race]] and attempted to establish through conquest such an empire throughout [[Europe]].  They were [[World War II]] "[[Axis powers]]" allies of the Japanese empire.

Some academics and writers describe [[Judaism|Jewish]] supremacism, especially related to [[Israel]] and [[Zionism]]. Author Minna Rozen describes the 17th century Jews of [[Jerusalem]]s’ view of themselves as an elite group among Jews as supremacism.&lt;ref&gt;Minna Rozen, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=Pt50fMlgKuMC&amp; Jewish identity and society in the seventeenth century: reflections on the life and work of Refael Mordekhai Malki],''  Mohr Siebeck, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Pt50fMlgKuMC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=Jewish+Supremacism&amp;ei=G5IJSri3DIPIyAThjdTfDg&amp; 129], 1992 ISBN 3161457706, 9783161457708&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ilan Pappé]] writes that the [[First Aliyah]] to Israel "established a society based on Jewish supremacy."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ilan Pappé]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=JzfgvSiUt9QC The Israel/Palestine question], [http://books.google.com/books?id=JzfgvSiUt9QC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=Jewish+Supremacy&amp;ei=ap0JSqfSH56GyATI4_SRAw 89], 1999 ISBN 041516947X, 9780415169479&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joseph Massad]] holds that "Jewish supremacism" always has been a "dominating principle" of religious and secular Zionism.&lt;ref&gt;David Hirsch, [http://www.yale.edu/yiisa/workingpaper/hirsh/David%20Hirsh%20YIISA%20Working%20Paper1.pdf Anti-Zionism and Antisemitism: Cosmopolitan Reflections], The Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Antisemitism Working Paper Series; discussion of [[Joseph Massad]]'s "The Ends of Zionism: Racism and the Palestinian Struggle", Interventions, Volume 5, Number 3, 2003, 440-451, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Joseph Massad's [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/mealac/faculty/massad/ "Response to the Ad Hoc Grievance Committee Report1"] on his [[Columbia University]] web site during a 2002 rally he said "Israeli Jews will continue to feel threatened if they persist in supporting Jewish supremacy." Massad notes there that others have misquoted him as saying Israel was a “Jewish supremacist and racist state.”  See for example David Horowitz, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=CYqZjtVp00AC&amp; The professors: the 101 most dangerous academics in America],'' Regnery Publishing, [http://books.google.com/books?id=CYqZjtVp00AC&amp;pg=PA271&amp;dq=“Jewish+supremacist+and+racist+state”&amp;num=100&amp;ei=N6UJSuDoCYPuzQSs5MXyBw&amp; 271], 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gilad Atzmon]] labels the ideology he calls “Jewishness” as "very much a supremacist, racist tendency."&lt;ref&gt;Jim Gilchrest interview with [[Gilad Atzmon]], [http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/features/39I-thought-music-could-heal.3804991.jp?CommentPage=1&amp;CommentPageLength=1000 I thought music could heal the wounds of the past.
