'''Supremacism''' is any [[ideology]] which holds that a certain thing is supreme among its type. Most often, the term is used to refer to demographic supremacism, wherein the belief is that one class of people is supreme. Such classes of people could be based on [[Human development (biology)|age]], [[race (human categorization)|race]] (classification of human beings), [[species]], [[ethnicity]], [[gender]] ([[social construct]]), [[sexuality]], [[social class]], [[ideology]], [[nation]], or [[culture]], or any other part of a population.

Some [[Feminism|feminist]] theorists{{who|date=July 2019}} have argued that in [[patriarchy]], a standard of male supremacism is enforced through a variety of cultural, political, and interpersonal strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Reeves Sanday, ''Female power and male dominance: on the origins of sexual inequality,'' Cambridge University Press, 1981, [https://books.google.com/books?id=39ScGl-T3J0C&amp;pg=PA6 pp. 6–8], [https://books.google.com/books?id=39ScGl-T3J0C&amp;pg=PA113 113–14], [https://books.google.com/books?id=39ScGl-T3J0C&amp;pg=PA174 174], [https://books.google.com/books?id=39ScGl-T3J0C&amp;pg=PA182 182]. {{ISBN|0-521-28075-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-28075-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 19th century there have been a number of feminist movements opposed to male supremacism, usually aimed at achieving equal legal rights and protections for women in all cultural, political and interpersonal relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= |title=Collins Dictionary and Thesaurus |year=2006 |publisher=Collins |location=London |isbn=978-0-00-722405-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Humm, Maggie |authorlink= |title=Modern feminisms: Political, Literary, Cultural |year=1992 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-231-08072-9 |pages= |url=https://archive.org/details/modernfeminismsp0000humm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cornell&gt;{{cite book |author=Cornell, Drucilla |authorlink=Drucilla Cornell|title=At the heart of freedom: feminism, sex, and equality |year=1998 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J. |isbn=978-0-691-02896-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, the phrase "[[The White Man's Burden]]", referring to the thought that whites have the obligation to make the societies of the other peoples more 'civilized', was widely used to justify imperialist policy as a noble enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Miller, Stuart Creighton| title= Benevolent Assimilation: The American Conquest of the Philippines, 1899–1903 | publisher= Yale University Press | year=1982 | isbn=978-0-300-03081-5}} p. 5: "...imperialist editors came out in favor of retaining the entire archipelago (using) higher-sounding justifications related to the "white man's burden."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Opinion archive, International Herald Tribune| title=In Our Pages: 100, 75 and 50 Years Ago; 1899: Kipling's Plea | journal=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=February 4, 1999 | volume= | issue= | pages= 6 | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1999/02/04/edold.t_10.php }}: Notes that Rudyard Kipling's new poem, "The White Man's Burden", "is regarded as the strongest argument yet published in favor of expansion."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Carlyle]], known for his historical account of the French Revolution, ''[[The French Revolution: A History]],'' which inspired [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', argued that European supremacist policies were justified on the grounds that they provided the greatest benefit to "inferior" native peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cruel.org/econthought/texts/carlyle/carlodnq.html | title=Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even at the time of its publication in 1849, Carlyle's main work on the subject, the ''[[Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question]],'' was received poorly by his contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cruel.org/econthought/texts/carlyle/negroquest.html | title=Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], the [[Confederate States of America]] was founded with a constitution that contained clauses which restricted the government's ability to limit or interfere with the institution of "negro" slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_csa.asp | title=Constitution of the Confederate States | date=March 11, 1861 }}: "No bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law denying or impairing the right of property in negro slaves shall be passed."&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Cornerstone Speech]], Confederate vice president [[Alexander H.

Its purpose was to "restore" white supremacy after the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] period, even though there still was white, Protestant supremacy in the United States, at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877,'' Perennial (HarperCollins), 1989, pp. 425–26.&lt;/ref&gt; The group preached supremacy over all other races, as well as supremacy over [[Jews]], [[Catholic]]s, and other minorities.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

According to William Nichols, [[religious antisemitism]] can be distinguished from [[Racial antisemitism|modern antisemitism]] which is based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] or [[ethnicity|ethnic]] grounds. "The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion ... a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon baptism." However, with racial antisemitism, "Now the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism ... . From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews... Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear."&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, William: ''Christian Antisemitism, A History of Hate'' (1993) p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first [[typology (anthropology)|typologies]] which was used to classify various human races was invented by [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] (1854–1936), a theoretician of [[eugenics]], who published in 1899 ''L'Aryen et son rôle social'' (1899 – "The [[Aryan]] and his social role"). In this book, he classifies humanity into various, hierarchized races, spanning from the "Aryan white race, dolichocephalic", to the "brachycephalic", "mediocre and inert" race, best represented by Southern European, Catholic peasants".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The end of the soul: scientific modernity, atheism, and anthropology in France|last=1965–|first=Hecht, Jennifer Michael|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0231128469|location=New York|page=171|oclc=53118940}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between these, Vacher de Lapouge identified the "''[[Nordic theory|Homo europaeus]]''" (Teutonic, Protestant, etc.), the "''[[Homo alpinus]]''" ([[Auvergne (province)|Auvergnat]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]], etc.), and finally the "''[[Homo mediterraneus]]''" ([[Naples|Neapolitan]], [[Andalusia|Andalus]], etc.) Jews were brachycephalic like the Aryans, according to Lapouge; but exactly for this reason he considered them dangerous; they were the only group, he thought, which was threatening to displace the Aryan aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The end of the soul : scientific modernity, atheism, and anthropology in France|last=1965-|first=Hecht, Jennifer Michael|date=2003|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0231128469|location=New York|pages=171–72|oclc=53118940}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vacher de Lapouge became one of the leading inspirations of [[Nazi]] [[antisemitism]] and [[Nazi racial policies|Nazi racist ideology]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Pierre-André Taguieff]], ''La couleur et le sang&amp;nbsp;– Doctrines racistes à la française'' ("Colour and Blood&amp;nbsp;– Racist doctrines ''à la française''"), Paris, [[Mille et une nuits]], 2002, 203 pages, and ''La Force du préjugé&amp;nbsp;– Essai sur le racisme et ses doubles'', Tel [[Gallimard]], La Découverte, 1987, 644 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cornel West]], an African-American philosopher, writes that [[Black supremacist]] religious views arose in America as part of [[Nation of Islam|black Muslim]] theology in response to [[white supremacism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cornel West]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=p89c2eTJgJgC Race Matters]'', Beacon Press, 1993, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p89c2eTJgJgC&amp;pg=PA99 p. 99]: "The basic aim of [[Nation of Islam|black Muslim]] theology—with its distinct black supremacist account of the origins of white people—was to counter white supremacy."&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in their analysis of the sources of the conflict, Julie Flint and [[Alex de Waal]] say that [[Muammar Gaddafi|Colonel Gaddafi]], the leader of [[Libya]], sponsored "Arab supremacism" across the [[Sahara]] during the 1970s. Gaddafi supported the "[[Islamic Legion]]" and the Sudanese opposition "[[National Islamic Front|National Front]], including the [[Muslim Brotherhood|Muslim Brothers]] and the Ansar, the [[National Umma Party|Umma Party]]'s military wing." Gaddafi tried to use such forces to annex [[Chad]] from 1979-81. Gaddafi supported the Sudanese government's [[Second Sudanese Civil War|war in the South]] during the early 1980s, and in return he was allowed to use the Darfur region as a "[[Chadian–Libyan conflict|back door to Chad]]." As a result, the first signs of an "Arab racist political platform" appeared in Darfur in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Flint and de Waal, Darfur: A New History of a Long War, rev. ed. (London and New York: Zed Books, 2008), pp.47-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Asia]], ancient Indians considered all foreigners [[barbarian]]s. The Muslim scholar [[Al-Biruni]] wrote that the Indians called foreigners impure.&lt;ref name="The First Spring p.313"&gt;''The First Spring: The Golden Age of India'' by Abraham Eraly p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; A few centuries later, Dubois observes that "Hindus look upon Europeans as barbarians totally ignorant of all principles of honour and good breeding... In the eyes of a Hindu, a Pariah ([[Dalit|outcaste]]) and a European are on the same level."&lt;ref name="The First Spring p.313"/&gt; The Chinese viewed the Europeans as repulsive, ghost-like creatures, and even as devils.

From 1933 to 1945, [[Nazi Germany]], under the rule of [[Adolf Hitler]], promoted the idea of a superior, [[Aryan race|Aryan]] ''[[Herrenvolk]]'', or [[master race]]. The [[Nazi propaganda|state's propaganda]] advocated the belief that [[Germanic peoples]], whom they called "Aryans", were a master race or a ''Herrenvolk'' that was superior to the [[Jews]], [[Slavs]], and [[Romani people]], so-called "gypsies". [[Arthur de Gobineau]], a French racial theorist and aristocrat, blamed the fall of the [[Ancien Régime|ancien régime]] in France on [[Miscegenation|racial intermixing]], which he argued had destroyed the purity of the Nordic race. Gobineau's theories, which attracted a strong following in Germany, emphasized the existence of an irreconcilable polarity between Aryan and Jewish cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Blamires, Cyprian; Jackson, Paul.

See for example David Horowitz, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CYqZjtVp00AC&amp; The professors: the 101 most dangerous academics in America],'' Regnery Publishing, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CYqZjtVp00AC&amp;pg=PA271 271], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zionism]] was established with the political goal of creating a sovereign Jewish state where Jews could be the majority, rather than the minority which they were in all nations of the world at that time. [[Theodor Herzl]], the ideological father of Zionism, considered [[Antisemitism]] to be an eternal feature of all societies in which Jews lived as minorities, and as a result, he believed that only a separation could allow Jews to escape [[Persecution of Jews|eternal persecution]]. "Let them give us sovereignty over a piece of the Earth's surface, just sufficient for the needs of our people, then we will do the rest!"&lt;ref&gt;Herzl, Theodor (1896).
