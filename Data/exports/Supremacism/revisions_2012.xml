'''Supremacism''' is the belief that a particular [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[species]], [[ethnic group]], [[religion]], [[gender]], [[sexual orientation]], [[social class|class]], [[Belief|belief system]] or [[culture]] is superior to others and entitles those who identify with it to dominate, control or rule those who do not.

== Sexual ==

Many anthropologists consider male supremacism, also known as “male dominance” or “[[patriarchy]]”, to exist in all cultures throughout human history. Under it special rights or status is granted to men, i.e. "[[male privilege]]." Such supremacy is enforced through a variety of cultural, political and interpersonal strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Reeves Sanday,  ''Female power and male dominance: on the origins of sexual inequality,'' Cambridge University Press, 1981, [http://books.google.com/books?id=39ScGl-T3J0C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22male+dominance%22++%22male+supremacism%22&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=8#v=onepage&amp;q=%22male%20supremacism%22&amp;f=false p. 6-8, 113-114, 174, 182]. ISBN 0-521-28075-3, ISBN 978-0-521-28075-4&lt;/ref&gt;  Others note that this often has been balanced by various forms of female authority.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Reeves Sanday, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 19th century there have been a number of  [[feminist]] movements opposed to male supremacism and working for equal legal rights and protections for women in all cultural, political and interpersonal relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= |title=Collins Dictionary and Thesaurus |year=2006 |publisher=Collins |location=London |isbn=0-00-722405-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Humm, Maggie |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Modern feminisms: Political, Literary, Cultural |year=1992 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-231-08072-7 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cornell&gt;{{cite book |author=Cornell, Drucilla |authorlink=Drucilla Cornell|title=At the heart of freedom: feminism, sex, and equality |year=1998 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J. |isbn=978-0-691-02896-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racial==
Centuries of European colonialism of the Americas, Africa, Australia, Oceania and Asia were justified by white supremacist attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Takashi Fujitani, Geoffrey Miles White, Lisa Yoneyama, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Ltm9hv0_4A0C&amp;pg=PA303&amp;dq=white+european+supremacism+colonialism&amp;ei=9uFcS_awL6a8zgS9q7SMCw&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=white%20european%20supremacism%20colonialism&amp;f=false ''Perilous memories: the Asia-Pacific War(s)''], p. 303, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 19th century, the phrase "[[The White Man's Burden]]" was widely used to justify imperialist policy as a noble enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Miller, Stuart Creighton| title= Benevolent Assimilation: The American Conquest of the Philippines, 1899-1903 | publisher= Yale University Press | year=1982 | isbn=0-300-03081-9}} p. 5: "...imperialist editors came out in favor of retaining the entire archipelago (using) higher-sounding justifications related to the "white man's burden."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Opinion archive, International Herald Tribune| title=In Our Pages: 100, 75 and 50 Years Ago; 1899: Kipling's Plea | journal=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=February 4, 1999 | volume= | issue= | pages= 6 | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1999/02/04/edold.t_10.php }}: Notes that Rudyard Kipling's new poem, "The White Man's Burden", "is regarded as the strongest argument yet published in favor of expansion."&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[American Civil War]], a secret society, the [[Ku Klux Klan]], was formed in the South. Its purpose was to restore white supremacy after the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877,'' Perennial (HarperCollins), 1989, p. 425–426.&lt;/ref&gt; They preached supremacy over all other races, as well as over [[Jew]]s, [[Catholic]]s and other minorities.

[[Cornel West]] writes that [[Black supremacy|Black Muslim supremacy]] arose in America as a counter to [[white supremacism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cornel West]], ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=p89c2eTJgJgC&amp;dq=race+matters+cornell+west&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Race Matters]'', Beacon Press, 1993, p 99.: "The basic aim of black Muslim theology — with its distinct black supremacist account of the origins of white people — was to counter white supremacy."&lt;/ref&gt; Groups advocating some version of it include [[Nation of Islam]], the [[New Black Panther Party]], the [[Black Hebrew Israelites]] and the [[Mansions of Rastafari|Bobo Shanti]] section of the [[Rastafari movement]]. 

During the early 20th century until the end of [[World War II]] - the [[Shōwa era]] - the propaganda of the [[Empire of Japan]] used the old concept of [[hakko ichiu]] to support the idea that the [[Yamato people|Yamato]] was a superior race, destined to rule Asia and the Pacific. Many documents such as ''[[Kokutai no Hongi]]'', ''[[Shinmin no Michi]]'' and ''[[An Investigation of Global Policy with the Yamato Race as Nucleus]]'' referred to this concept of racial supremacy. 

During the 1930s and 1940s, [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Germany|German]] [[Nazism|Nazi]] Party preached the existence of an [[Aryan#Racist connotations|Aryan]] [[master race]] and attempted to establish through conquest such an empire throughout [[Europe]].  They were [[World War II]] "[[Axis powers]]" allies of the Japanese empire.

Some academics and writers have alleged [[Christian]] supremacism as a motivation for the [[Crusades]] to the “[[Holy Land]],” as well as for crusades against [[Muslim]]s and [[pagan]]s throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Lansing, Edward D.
