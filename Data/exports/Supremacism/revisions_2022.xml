'''Supremacism''' is the belief that a certain group of people is superior to all others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/supremacist|title=Supremacist|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supposed superior people can be defined by [[Human development (biology)|age]], [[gender]], [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], [[sexual orientation]], [[language]], [[social class]], [[ideology]], [[nation]], [[culture]], or belong to any other part of a particular population.

Before the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], the [[Confederate States of America]] was founded with a constitution that contained clauses which restricted the government's ability to limit or interfere with the institution of "negro" slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_csa.asp | title=Constitution of the Confederate States | date=March 11, 1861 }}: "No bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law denying or impairing the right of property in negro slaves shall be passed."&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Cornerstone Speech]], Confederate vice president [[Alexander H.

According to William Nichols, [[religious antisemitism]] can be distinguished from [[Racial antisemitism|modern antisemitism]] which is based on [[Race (human categorization)|racial]] or [[ethnic group|ethnic]] grounds. "The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion ... a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon [[baptism]]." However, with racial antisemitism, "Now the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism ... . From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews... Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear."&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, William: ''Christian Antisemitism, A History of Hate'' (1993) p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first [[typology (anthropology)|typologies]] which was used to classify various human races was invented by [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] (1854–1936), a theoretician of [[eugenics]], who published ''L'Aryen et son rôle social'' (1899 – "The [[Aryan]] and his social role") in 1899. In his book, he divides humanity into various, [[Racial hierarchy|hierarchical races]], starting with the highest race which is the "Aryan white race, dolichocephalic", and ending with the lowest race which is the "brachycephalic", "mediocre and inert" race, that race is best represented by [[Southern Europe]]an, [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] peasants".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The end of the soul: scientific modernity, atheism, and anthropology in France|last=Hecht|first=Jennifer Michael|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0231128469|location=New York|page=171|oclc=53118940}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between these, Vacher de Lapouge identified the "''[[Nordic theory|Homo europaeus]]''" ([[Teutons|Teutonic]], [[Protestantism|Protestant]], etc.), the "''[[Homo alpinus]]''" ([[Auvergne (province)|Auvergnat]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]], etc.), and finally the "''[[Homo mediterraneus]]''" ([[Naples|Neapolitan]], [[Andalusia|Andalus]], etc.) Jews were brachycephalic just like the Aryans were, according to Lapouge; but he considered them dangerous for this exact reason; they were the only group, he thought, which was threatening to displace the Aryan aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The end of the soul : scientific modernity, atheism, and anthropology in France|last=Hecht|first=Jennifer Michael|date=2003|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0231128469|location=New York|pages=171–172|oclc=53118940}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vacher de Lapouge became one of the leading inspirations of [[Nazi]] [[antisemitism]] and [[Nazi racial policies|Nazi racist ideology]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Pierre-André Taguieff]], ''La couleur et le sang&amp;nbsp;– Doctrines racistes à la française'' ("Colour and Blood&amp;nbsp;– Racist doctrines ''à la française''"), Paris, [[Mille et une nuits]], 2002, 203 pages, and ''La Force du préjugé&amp;nbsp;– Essai sur le racisme et ses doubles'', Tel [[Gallimard]], La Découverte, 1987, 644 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in their analysis of the sources of the conflict, Julie Flint and [[Alex de Waal]] say that [[Muammar Gaddafi|Colonel Gaddafi]], the leader of [[Libya]], sponsored "Arab supremacism" across the [[Sahara]] during the 1970s. Gaddafi supported the "[[Islamic Legion]]" and the Sudanese opposition "[[National Islamic Front|National Front]], including the [[Muslim Brotherhood|Muslim Brothers]] and the Ansar, the [[National Umma Party|Umma Party]]'s military wing." Gaddafi tried to use such forces to annex [[Chad]] from 1979–81. Gaddafi supported the Sudanese government's [[Second Sudanese Civil War|war in the South]] during the early 1980s, and in return, he was allowed to use the Darfur region as a "[[Chadian–Libyan conflict|back door to Chad]]". As a result, the first signs of an "Arab racist political platform" appeared in Darfur in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Flint and de Waal, ''Darfur: A New History of a Long War'', rev. ed. (London and New York: Zed Books, 2008), pp. 47–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1933 to 1945, [[Nazi Germany]], under the rule of [[Adolf Hitler]], promoted the idea of a superior, [[Aryan race|Aryan]] ''[[Herrenvolk]]'', or [[master race]]. The [[Nazi propaganda|state's propaganda]] advocated the belief that [[Germanic peoples]], whom they called "Aryans", were a master race or a ''Herrenvolk'' whose members were superior to the [[Jews]], [[Slavs]], and [[Romani people]], so-called "gypsies". [[Arthur de Gobineau]], a French racial theorist and aristocrat, blamed the fall of the [[Ancien Régime|ancien régime]] in France on [[Miscegenation|racial intermixing]], which he believed had destroyed the purity of the [[Nordic race]]. Gobineau's theories, which attracted a large and strong following in Germany, emphasized the existence of an irreconcilable polarity between Aryan and [[Jewish culture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Blamires, Cyprian; Jackson, Paul.

[[Ilan Pappé]], an [[expatriate]] [[Israelis|Israeli]] historian, writes that the [[First Aliyah]] to [[Israel]] "established a society based on Jewish supremacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ilan Pappé |title=The Israel/Palestine question |page=89 |year=1999 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nUqCwLOW-sC&amp;pg=PA89 |quote=Whereas the First Aliya established a society based on Jewish supremacy, the Second Aliya's method of colonization was separation from Palestinians.|author-link=Ilan Pappé |isbn=978-0415169479 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Massad]], a professor of [[Arab studies]], holds that "Jewish supremacism" has always been a "dominating principle" in [[Religious Zionism|religious]] and secular [[Zionism]].&lt;ref&gt;David Hirsch, [http://www.yale.edu/yiisa/workingpaper/hirsh/David%20Hirsh%20YIISA%20Working%20Paper1.pdf Anti-Zionism and Antisemitism: Cosmopolitan Reflections] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011202833/http://www.yale.edu/yiisa/workingpaper/hirsh/David%20Hirsh%20YIISA%20Working%20Paper1.pdf |date=2008-10-11 }}, The Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Antisemitism Working Paper Series; discussion of [[Joseph Massad]]'s "The Ends of Zionism: Racism and the Palestinian Struggle", Interventions, Volume 5, Number 3, 2003, 440–451, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Joseph Massad]]'s [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/mealac/faculty/massad/ "Response to the Ad Hoc Grievance Committee Report1"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913023411/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/mealac/faculty/massad/ |date=2006-09-13 }} on his [[Columbia University]] web site during a 2002 rally he said "Israeli Jews will continue to feel threatened if they persist in supporting Jewish supremacy." Massad notes there that others have misquoted him as saying that Israel was a "Jewish supremacist and racist state." See for example David Horowitz, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CYqZjtVp00AC&amp; The professors: the 101 most dangerous academics in America],'' Regnery Publishing, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CYqZjtVp00AC&amp;pg=PA271 271], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Zionism was established with the political goal of creating a sovereign Jewish state where Jews could be the majority, rather than the minority which they were in all nations of the world at that time. [[Theodor Herzl]], the ideological father of Zionism, considered [[antisemitism]] to be an eternal feature of all societies in which Jews lived as minorities, and as a result, he believed that only a separation could allow Jews to escape [[Persecution of Jews|eternal persecution]]. "Let them give us sovereignty over a piece of the Earth's surface, just sufficient for the needs of our people, then we will do the rest!"&lt;ref&gt;Herzl, Theodor (1896).
