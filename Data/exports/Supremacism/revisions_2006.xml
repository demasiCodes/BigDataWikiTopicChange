'''Supremacism''' is the belief that a particular [[race]], [[religion]], [[gender]], [[Belief|belief system]] or [[culture]] is superior to others and entitles those who identify with it to dominate, control or rule those who do not. Examples include supremacism based on [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] or [[Anthropology|anthropological]] origins ([[White supremacy|white supremacy]], [[Black supremacy|black supremacy]], [[ethnocentrism]]), [[human sexuality|sexuality]] (male supremacy, female supremacy) and [[religion]] (see below).

== Beliefs and ideas ==
If someone believes something is true whilst someone else believes it is false, each will probably regard the evidence and [[reasoning]] for his or her belief to be superior (more informed, more considered) than that of the other. For instance, if person X believes the [[Flat Earth|Earth is flat]] whilst person Y believes it isn't, X would probably consider the evidence and reasoning for his or her belief to be superior to that of Y.

Supremacism, however, goes much further. A supremacist not only holds that any evidence and reasoning for his or her beliefs is superior to any other, but that those holding such beliefs have rights over those who do not.

== Attempts at justification ==
Following the development of theories such as [[evolution]] and [[eugenics]], supremacists have sought [[Science|scientific]] justification for their views through notions such as [[Social Darwinism]]. The most notorious and far-reaching example is probably the [[Nazism|Nazi]] belief in an [[Aryan#Racist connotations|Aryan]] [[master race]], which ultimately led to the [[the Holocaust]].
