'''Misandry''' ({{pron-en|mɪˈsændri}}) is hatred (or contempt) of [[men]] or [[boys]].
Misandry comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''misogunia'' (μισογυνία) from ''misos'' (μῖσος, "hatred") and ''anēr'', ''andros'' (ἀνήρ, ἀνδρός; "man"). It is parallel to [[misogyny]]—the hatred of women or girls. Misandry is also comparable with (but not the same as) [[misanthropy]] which is the hatred of humanity in general. The prefix [[miso-]], meaning 'Hatred' or 'To hate' applies in many other words, such as [[misogynist|misogyny]], misocapny, [[wikt:misogamy|misogamy]], misarchy and misoxeny. Misandry is the antonym of [[Wiktionary:Philandry|Philandry]]—the fondness towards men, love, or admiration of them.

Classics professor Froma Zeitlin of [[Princeton University]] discussed misandry in her article titled "Patterns of Gender in Aeschylean Drama: Seven against Thebes and the Danaid Trilogy."&lt;ref name="Zeitlin" /&gt; She writes:
{{cquote|The most significant point of contact, however, between [[Eteocles]] and the suppliant [[Danaids]] is, in fact, their extreme positions with regard to the opposite sex: the misogyny of Eteocles’ outburst against all women of whatever variety (Se. 181-202) has its counterpart in the seeming '''misandry''' of the Danaids, who although opposed to their [[Egypt]]ian cousins in particular (marriage with them is [[incest]]uous, they are violent men) often extend their objections to include the race of males as a whole and view their cause as a passionate contest between the sexes (cf. Su. 29, 393, 487, 818, 951).&lt;ref name="Zeitlin"&gt;{{cite paper

=== Misandry and literary criticism ===
In his book, ''Gender and Judaism: The transformation of tradition'', Harry Brod, a Professor of Philosophy and Humanities in the Department of Philosophy and Religion at the [[University of Northern Iowa]], writes:
{{cquote|
In the introduction to ''The Great Comic Book Heroes'', Jules Feiffer writes that this is [[Superman]]'s joke on the rest of us. Clark is Superman's vision of what other men are really like. We are scared, incompetent, and powerless, particularly around women. Though Feiffer took the joke good-naturedly, his misandry embodied the Clark and his misogyny in his wish that [[Lois Lane|Lois]] be enamored of Clark (much like [[Oberon]] takes out hostility toward [[Titania]] by having her fall in love with an ass in [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Midsummer-Night's Dream]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=SH8r3ntJG8AC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA279&amp;dq=greek+misandry&amp;ots=DIRIiG6cvR&amp;sig=RAkhjK9tDe9tKUt92TME85D7dL4 Gender and Judaism: The transformation of tradition], Harry Brod&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Julie M. Thompson, a [[feminist]] author, connects misandry with envy of men, in particular "[[penis envy]]", a term coined by [[Sigmund Freud]] in 1908, in his theory of female sexual development.&lt;ref&gt;

===Misandry and feminism===

In ''My Enemy, My Love'' (1992), [[Judith Levine]] reveals a position of misandry within women when the following inappropriate labels are applied to males :

* Infants: the Mama's Boy, the Babbler, the Bumbler and the Invalid
* Betrayers: the Seducer, the Slave, the Abandoner and the Abductor
* Beasts: the Brute, the Pet, the Pervert, the Prick and the Killer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levine |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Levine |title=My Enemy, My Love |publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |year=1992 |isbn=0385410794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of misandry can be found in the ''[[SCUM Manifesto]]'' by [[Valerie Solanas]], a [[Radical feminism|radical feminist]]:
{{Quote|As for the issue of whether or not to continue to reproduce males, it doesn't follow that because the male, like disease, has always existed among us that he should continue to exist. 

When genetic control is possible &amp;mdash; and soon it will be &amp;mdash; it goes without saying that we should produce only whole, complete beings, not physical defects of deficiencies, including emotional deficiencies, such as maleness. Just as the deliberate production of [[blindness|blind]] people would be highly immoral, so would be the deliberate production of emotional cripples.|Valerie Solanas, ''SCUM Manifesto''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|quote=''SCUM Manifesto'' [...] was one of the earliest, wittiest, and most eccentric expressions of second-wave feminism. Solanas’s unabashed misandry &amp;mdash; especially her belief in men’s biological inferiority &amp;mdash; her endorsement of relationships between ‘independent women,’ and her dismissal of sex as ‘the refuge of the mindless’ contravened the sort of radical feminism which prevailed in most women’s groups across the country.

==Conservative discourse on misandry==
[[Christina Hoff Sommers]], a [[conservative]] commentator, argues that feminism has a 
"corrosive paradox" and that no group of women can wage war on men without at the same time denigrating the women who respect those men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wendy McElroy]], an [[individualist feminist]] and [[Fox News]] commentator,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.org/aboutus/person_detail.asp?id=488 The Independent Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; argues that some feminists "have redefined the view of the movement of the opposite sex" as "a hot anger toward men seems to have turned into a cold hatred."&lt;ref name="McElroy-05"&gt;{{Harv|McElroy|2001|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that men as a class are considered irreformable, all men are considered [[rape|rapists]], and marriage, rape and [[prostitution]] are seen as the same. 

McElroy states "a new ideology has come to the forefront... radical or gender, feminism", one that has "joined hands with [the] [[political correctness]] movement that condemns the panorama of western civilization as sexist and racist: the product of '[[dead white males]].'"&lt;ref name="McElroy-04_6"&gt;{{Harv|McElroy|2001|p=4-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Conservative [[Pundit (expert)|pundit]] Charlotte Hays argues "that the anti-male philosophy of radical feminism has filtered into the culture at large is incontestable; indeed, this attitude has become so pervasive that we hardly notice it any longer."&lt;ref&gt;Hays, Charlotte. 'The Worse Half'. National Review 11 March, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious Studies professors [[Nathanson and Young|Paul Nathanson and Katherine Young]] make similar comparisons in their three-book series ''Beyond the Fall of Man'',&lt;ref name="NYspreading-4_6"&gt;{{Harv|Nathanson|Young|2001|p=4-6}} "The same problem that long prevented mutual respect between [[Jew]]s and [[Christian]]s, the teaching of contempt, now prevents mutual respect between men and women."&lt;/ref&gt; which treats misandry as a form of prejudice and discrimination that has become institutionalized in [[North America]]n society. Nathanson and Young credit "ideological feminism" for imposing misandry on culture.&lt;ref name="NYspreading-xiv"&gt;{{Harv|Nathanson|Young|2001|p=xiv}} "[ideological feminism,] one form of feminism &amp;mdash; one that has had a great deal of influence, whether directly or indirectly, on both popular culture and elite culture&amp;mdash;is profoundly misandric."&lt;/ref&gt; 

Their book ''Spreading Misandry'' (2001) analyzes "[[pop culture|pop cultural]] artifacts and productions from the 1990s" from movies to greeting cards for what they consider contains pervasive messages of hatred toward men. ''Legalizing Misandry'' (2005) the second in the series, gives similar attention to laws in North America.
