'''Misandry''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|m|ɪ|ˈ|s|æ|n|d|r|i}}) is the hatred or dislike of [[men]] or [[boy]]s.
Misandry comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''misos'' (μῖσος, "hatred") and ''anēr'', ''andros'' (ἀνήρ, [[genitive|gen.]] ἀνδρός; "man").  ''Misandry'' is the antonym of [[wikt:philandry|philandry]], the fondness towards men, love, or admiration of them. The term [[misogyny]] is the equivalent term for women.

==In literature==
=== Ancient Greek literature ===
Classics professor [[Froma Zeitlin]] of [[Princeton University]] discussed misandry in her article titled "Patterns of Gender in [[Aeschylus|Aeschylean]] Drama: Seven against Thebes and the Danaid Trilogy."&lt;ref name="Zeitlin" /&gt; She writes:
{{quote|The most significant point of contact, however, between [[Eteocles]] and the suppliant [[Danaids]] is, in fact, their extreme positions with regard to the opposite sex: the misogyny of Eteocles' outburst against all women of whatever variety (Se. 181-202) has its counterpart in the seeming misandry of the Danaids, who although opposed to their [[Egypt]]ian cousins in particular (marriage with them is [[incest]]uous, they are violent men) often extend their objections to include the race of males as a whole and view their cause as a passionate contest between the sexes (cf. Su. 29, 393, 487, 818, 951).&lt;ref name="Zeitlin"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Literary criticism ===
In his book, ''Gender and Judaism: The Transformation of Tradition'', Harry Brod, a Professor of [[Philosophy]] and [[Humanities]] in the Department of Philosophy and [[Religion]] at the [[University of Northern Iowa]], writes:
{{quote|
In the introduction to ''The Great Comic Book Heroes'', [[Jules Feiffer]] writes that this is [[Superman]]'s joke on the rest of us. [[Clark Kent|Clark]] is Superman's vision of what other men are really like. We are scared, incompetent, and powerless, particularly around women. Though Feiffer took the joke good-naturedly, a more cynical response would see here the [[Kryptonian]]'s misanthropy, his misandry embodied in Clark and his misogyny in his wish that [[Lois Lane|Lois]] be enamored of Clark (much like [[Oberon]] takes out hostility toward [[Titania]] by having her fall in love with an ass in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Midsummer-Night's Dream]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=SH8r3ntJG8AC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA279&amp;dq=greek+misandry&amp;ots=DIRIiG6cvR&amp;sig=RAkhjK9tDe9tKUt92TME85D7dL4 ''Gender and Judaism: The Transformation of Tradition]'', Harry Brod&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

[[Julie M. Thompson]], a [[feminist]] author, connects misandry with envy of men, in particular "[[penis envy]]," a term coined by [[Sigmund Freud]] in 1908, in his theory of female sexual development.&lt;ref&gt;

==Comparisons with other forms of bigotry==
In 1999, [[Masculism|masculist]] writer [[Warren Farrell]] compared the dehumanizing stereotyping of men to the dehumanization of the [[Vietnamese people]] as "[[Gook#G|gooks]]."&lt;ref name=Farrell-1999&gt;{{cite book

Religious Studies professors Paul Nathanson and Katherine Young made similar comparisons in their 2001, three-book series ''Beyond the Fall of Man'',&lt;ref name="NYspreading-4_6"&gt;{{Harv|Nathanson|Young|2001|pp=4–6}} "The same problem that long prevented mutual respect between [[Jew]]s and [[Christian]]s, the teaching of contempt, now prevents mutual respect between men and women."&lt;/ref&gt; which treats misandry as a form of prejudice and discrimination that has become institutionalized in North American society.

In the 2007 book ''International Encyclopedia of Men and Masculinities'', Marc A. Ouellette directly contrasted misandry and misogyny, arguing that "misandry lacks the systemic, transhistoric, institutionalized, and legislated antipathy of misogyny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= |first1= |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=Flood |editor1-link=Michael Flood |others=''et al.'' |title=International Encyclopedia of Men and Masculinities|url=http://books.google.com/?id=EUON2SYps-QC&amp;pg=PA442&amp;dq=michael+flood+misandry#v=onepage&amp;q=michael%20flood%20misandry&amp;f=false |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= 2007-07-18|year= |month= |publisher=Routledge |location= London; New York |isbn= 0-41533-343-1 |oclc= |doi=  |page= |pages=|chapter= |chapterurl= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthropology|Anthropologist]] David D. Gilmore argues that while [[misogyny]] is a "near-universal phenomenon" there is no female equivalent to misogyny. He writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;Man hating among women has no popular name because it has never (at least not until recently) achieved apotheosis as a social ''fact'', that is, it has never been ratified into public, culturally recognized and approved ''institutions'' (...) As a cultural institution, misogyny therefore seems to stand alone as a gender-based phobia, unreciprocated.&lt;ref name="gilmore"&gt;Gilmore, David G. "Misogyny: The Male Malady". Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2009, pp. 10-13, ISBN 978-0-81-221770-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Gilmore also states that [[neologism]]s like misandry refer "not to the hatred of men as men, but to the hatred of men's traditional [[gender role|male role]]" and a "culture of [[machismo]]". Therefore, he argues, misandry is "different from the intensely ''ad feminam'' aspect of misogyny that targets women no matter what they believe or do".&lt;ref name="gilmore"/&gt;

==Notable instances==
Academic [[Alice Echols]], in her 1989 book ''Daring To Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967–1975'', argued that [[Radical feminism|radical feminist]] [[Valerie Solanas]], best known for her [[attempted murder]] of [[Andy Warhol]] in 1968, displayed an extreme level of misandry compared to other radical feminists of the time in her [[tract]], ''[[SCUM Manifesto|The SCUM Manifesto]]''. Echols stated,
{{quote|Solanas's unabashed misandry—especially her belief in men's biological inferiority—her endorsement of relationships between 'independent women,' and her dismissal of sex as 'the refuge of the mindless' contravened the sort of radical feminism which prevailed in most women's groups across the country.&lt;ref&gt;Echols, Nicole. [http://books.google.com/books?id=6zaVkAjBuPEC&amp;pg=PA104 "Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967-1975"]. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1989, pp. 104-105, ISBN 978-0-81-661786-9.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Some other researchers{{Who?|date=November 2011}} have argued that Solanas' ''[[SCUM Manifesto]]'' was a [[parody]] of [[patriarchy]] and the Freudian theory of femininity, where the word ''woman'' was replaced by ''man''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The text contains all the clichés of Freudian [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical]] theory: the biological accident, the incomplete sex and "penis envy" which became "pussy envy."&lt;ref&gt;Castro, Ginette. [http://books.google.com/books?id=DYuBjJXGsZkC&amp;pg=PA73 "American Feminism: A Contemporary History"]. New York: New York University Press, 1990, p. 73, ISBN 978-0-81-471435-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Patricia Juliana.

New York: Routledge, 1999, p. 68, ISBN 978-0-41-592168-8.&lt;/ref&gt; She was later diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]; some observers think she was suffering from these illnesses at the time of her writing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,1432425,00.html Valerie Jean Solanas (1936-88)] ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bockris, Victor.

Nathanson and Young argued that "ideological feminism" has imposed misandry on culture.&lt;ref name="NYspreading-xiv"&gt;{{Harv|Nathanson|Young|2001|p=xiv}} "[ideological feminism,] one form of feminism — one that has had a great deal of influence, whether directly or indirectly, on both popular culture and elite culture—is profoundly misandric".&lt;/ref&gt; Their 2001 book, ''Spreading Misandry'', analyzed "pop cultural artifacts and productions from the 1990s" from movies to greeting cards for what they considered to be pervasive messages of hatred toward men. ''Legalizing Misandry'' (2005), the second in the series, gave similar attention to laws in North America.

In 2002, [[Pundit (expert)|pundit]] [[Charlotte Hays]] wrote "that the anti-male philosophy of radical feminism has filtered into the culture at large is incontestable; indeed, this attitude has become so pervasive that we hardly notice it any longer".&lt;ref&gt;Hays, Charlotte. 'The Worse Half.' ''[[National Review]]'' 11 March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wendy McElroy==
{{Main|Wendy McElroy}}
[[Wendy McElroy]], an [[individualist feminist]] and [[Fox News]] commentator,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.org/aboutus/person_detail.asp?id=488 The Independent Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; wrote in 2001 that some feminists "have redefined the view of the movement of the opposite sex" as "a hot anger toward men seems to have turned into a cold hatred."&lt;ref name="McElroy-05"&gt;{{Harv|McElroy|2001|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argued it was a misandrist position to consider men, as a class, to be irreformable or [[rape|rapists]].  McElroy stated "a new ideology has come to the forefront... radical or gender, feminism," one that has "joined hands with [the] [[political correctness]] movement that condemns the panorama of [[western civilization]] as sexist and racist: the product of '[[dead white males]]'."&lt;ref name="McElroy-04_6"&gt;{{Harv|McElroy|2001|pp=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a criticism of feminism==
In his 1997 book ''The Gender Knot: Unraveling Our Patriarchal Legacy'', sociologist [[Allan G. Johnson]] stated that accusations of man-hating have been used to put down [[Feminism|feminists]]. Johnson notes that the word ''misandry'' did not appear in dictionaries until recently, but the concept of the hatred of men is long established. The accusation of misandry is often effective against feminists because "people often confuse men as individuals with men as a dominant and privileged category of people."&lt;ref name=Johnson107&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3nnxlqbN-IEC&amp;pg=PA107 |page=107 |last=Johnson |first=Allan G. |authorlink=Allan G. Johnson |title=The Gender Knot: Unraveling Our Patriarchal Legacy |publisher=Temple University Press |year=2005 |isbn=1592133835}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that given the "reality of women's oppression, [[male privilege]], and men's enforcement of both, it's hardly surprising that ''every'' woman should have moments where she resents or even hates 'men'."&lt;ref name=Johnson107/&gt;
