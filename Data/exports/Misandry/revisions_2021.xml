'''Misandry''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|s|æ|n|d|r|i}}) is the hatred of, contempt for, or prejudice against [[men]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/234242?redirectedFrom=Misandry#eid "Misandry"] at Oxford English Dictionary Online (ODO), Third Edition, June 2002. Accessed through library subscription on 25 July 2014. Earliest recorded use: 1885. ''Blackwood's Edinb. Mag'', Sept. 289/1 No man whom she cared for had ever proposed to marry her. She could not account for it, and it was a growing source of bitterness, of misogyny as well as misandry.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Misandry" at [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/misandry [[Merriam-Webster#Services|Merriam-Webster online]]] ("First Known Use: circa 1909")&lt;/ref&gt; It is the asymmetrical&lt;ref name="gilmore"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ouellette" /&gt; counterpart of [[misogyny]], prejudice against women.

The role of misandry in [[feminism]] is controversial and has been debated both within and outside feminist movements. [[antifeminism|Opponents of feminism]] often argue that feminism is misandristic. The validity of these perceptions and of the concept has been criticized as promoting a [[false equivalence]] between misandry and misogyny.

==Etymology==
Misandry is formed from the Greek ''misos'' (μῖσος, "hatred") and ''anēr'', ''andros'' (ἀνήρ, gen. ἀνδρός; "man").&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionaries http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/misandry&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the word can be found as far back as the 19th century, including an 1871 use in ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Misandry" the Word – Its Origin |url=http://unknownmisandry.blogspot.com/2011/02/misandry-word-its-origin.html|date=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Review of novel ''Blanche Seymour'', ''[[The Spectator]]'', London, 1 April 1871, p. 389. "We cannot, indeed, term her an absolute misandrist, as she fully admits the possibility, in most cases at least, of the reclamation of men from their naturally vicious and selfish state, though at the cost of so much trouble and vexation of spirit to women, that it is not quite clear whether she does not regard their existence as at best a mitigated evil".&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared in ''[[Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary]]'' (11th ed.) in 1952. Translation of the French {{lang|fr|misandrie}} to the German {{lang|de|Männerhass}} (Hatred of Men)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.pons.com/translate/german-english/M%C3%A4nnerha%C3%9F |title=Translations for Männerhaß in the German–English dictionary |publisher=PONS-Verlag|location=Stuttgart|work=Pons Dictionary German to English |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506132922/http://en.pons.com/translate/german-english/M%C3%A4nnerha%C3%9F |archive-date=6 May 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; is recorded in 1803.&lt;ref name="Krünitz1803"&gt;{{cite book|title=Oekonomische Encyklopädie oder allgemeines System der Staats-, Stadt-, Haus- u.

A term with a similar but distinct meaning is ''androphobia'', which describes a fear, but not necessarily hatred, of men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/misandry.htm | title=Misandry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Helen Pluckrose]] has argued that ''androphobia'' is the more propitious term in instances where aversion to men stems from a sense of fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://areomagazine.com/2017/10/17/androphobia-and-how-to-address-it/|title=Androphobia – and How to Address It|website=Areo|date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Men's rights movement|Men's rights]] activists and other [[masculinist]] groups have criticized modern laws concerning [[divorce]], [[domestic violence]], and [[Rape shield law|rape]] as examples of institutional misandry.{{refn|name=Ouellette}}&lt;ref name="AtlanticSexism"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Berlatsky |first1=Noah |title=When Men Experience Sexism |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/05/when-men-experience-sexism/276355/ |website=The Atlantic |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly |date=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RavishlyMyth"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Thériault |first1=Anne |title=The Myth of Misandry |url=https://ravishly.com/2015/01/07/myth-misandry-misogyny-oppression-marginalization |website=Ravishly Media Company |publisher=Ravishly.com |access-date=8 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious studies professors Paul Nathanson and [[Katherine K. Young|Katherine Young]] examined the institutionalization of misandry in the public sphere in their 2001 three-book series ''Beyond the Fall of Man'',{{sfn|Nathanson|Young|2001|pp=4–6}} which refers to misandry as a "form of prejudice and discrimination that has become institutionalized in North American society", writing, "The same problem that long prevented mutual respect between Jews and Christians, the teaching of contempt, now prevents mutual respect between men and women."{{sfn|Nathanson|Young|2001|page=6}} 

== In psychology ==
Glick and Fiske developed [[Psychometrics|psychometric constructs]] to measure the attitudes of individuals towards men, the ''Ambivalence toward Men Inventory AMI'', which includes a factor ''Hostility toward Men'' based on a small group discussion with women and then using statistical methods to reduce the number of questions. ''Hostility toward Men'' was split into three factors: ''Resentment of Paternalism'', the belief men supported male power, ''Compensatory Gender Differentiation'', the belief that men were supported by women and ''Heterosexual Hostility'', which looked at beliefs that men were likely to engage in hostile actions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Glick|first1=Peter|last2=Fiske|first2=Susan T.|date=2016-06-23|title=The Ambivalence Toward Men Inventory: Differentiating Hostile and Benevolent Beliefs About Men |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|language=en|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1999.tb00379.x|s2cid=145242896|issn=1471-6402}}&lt;/ref&gt; This construct was found to be inversely correlated with measures of gender equality when comparing countries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Glick |display-authors=etal |first=P |date=May 2004 |title=Bad but Bold: Ambivalent Attitudes Toward Men Predict Gender Inequality in 16 Nations |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=86 |issue=5 |pages=713–728 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.86.5.713|pmid=15161396 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a study with university students self-describing feminists were found to have a lower measure of hostility toward men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Kristin J.|last2=Kanner|first2=Melinda|last3=Elsayegh|first3=Nisreen|date=2009-06-01|title=Are Feminists man Haters?

==In literature==
===Ancient Greek literature===

Classics professor [[Froma Zeitlin]] of [[Princeton University]] discussed misandry in her article titled "Patterns of Gender in Aeschylean Drama: Seven against Thebes and the Danaid Trilogy".&lt;ref name="Zeitlin" /&gt; She writes:
{{quote|The most significant point of contact, however, between Eteocles and the suppliant Danaids is, in fact, their extreme positions with regard to the opposite sex: the misogyny of Eteocles' outburst against all women of whatever variety has its counterpart in the seeming misandry of the Danaids, who although opposed to their Egyptian cousins in particular (marriage with them is incestuous, they are violent men) often extend their objections to include the race of males as a whole and view their cause as a passionate contest between the sexes.&lt;ref name="Zeitlin"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Froma I.|last=Zeitlin|author-link=Froma Zeitlin|title=Patterns of Gender in Aeschylean Drama: Seven against Thebes and the Danaid Trilogy|date=1 April 1990|journal=Cabinet of the Muses – Rosenmeyer Festschrift|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2j81390f}} Princeton University, paper given at the Department of Classics, University of California, Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Shakespeare ===

Literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] argued that even though the word misandry is relatively unheard of in literature, it is not hard to find implicit, even explicit, misandry. In reference to the works of [[Shakespeare]], Bloom argued:&lt;ref&gt;Brockman, Elin Schoen. (25 July 1999) "In the Battle of the Sexes, This Word Is a Weapon", New York Times,  https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/25/weekinreview/in-the-battle-of-the-sexes-this-word-is-a-weapon.html?module=Search&amp;mabReward=relbias%3Ar&lt;/ref&gt; {{blockquote|I cannot think of one instance of misogyny whereas I would argue that misandry is a strong element. Shakespeare makes perfectly clear that women in general have to marry down and that men are narcissistic and not to be trusted and so forth. On the whole, he gives us a darker vision of human males than human females.}}

=== Modern literature ===

Anthony Synnott argues that there is a tendency in literature to represent men as villains and women as victims and argues that there is a market for "anti-male" novels with no corresponding "anti-female" market, citing ''[[The Women's Room]]'', by [[Marilyn French]], and ''[[The Color Purple]]'', by [[Alice Walker]]. He gives examples of comparisons of men to Nazi prison guards as a common theme in literature.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Synnott|first=Anthony|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ndnsCwAAQBAJ&amp;q=misandry|title=Re-Thinking Men: Heroes, Villains and Victims|date=2016-04-08|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-06393-3|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|156}}

Critic of mainstream feminism [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] has described [[Eve Ensler]]'s play ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'' as misandric in that "there are no admirable males&amp;nbsp;... the play presents a rogues' gallery of male brutes, sadists, child-molesters, genital mutilators, gang rapists and hateful little boys" which she finds out of step with the reality that "most men are not brutes. They are not oppressors".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aei.org/files/2008/11/19/20090108_ContemporaryFeminism.pdf "What's Wrong and What's Right with Contemporary Feminism?"], Hamilton College. Retrieved 2014-01-27. [[Christina Hoff Sommers|Sommers, Christina Hoff]].

[[Racialized]] misandry occurs in both "high" and "low" culture and literature. For instance, [[African-American]] men have often been disparagingly portrayed as either infantile or as eroticized and hyper-masculine, depending on prevailing cultural stereotypes.{{refn|name=Ouellette}}

Julie M. Thompson, a [[feminist]] author, connects misandry with envy of men, in particular "[[penis envy]]", a term coined by [[Sigmund Freud]] in 1908, in his theory of female sexual development.&lt;ref&gt;
Emphasis added. Julie M. Thompson, ''Mommy Queerest: Contemporary Rhetorics of Lesbian Maternal Identity'', (Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy Kang has discussed "the misandric impulse" in relation to the works of [[Toni Morrison]].&lt;ref&gt;Kang, N. (2003), [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/callaloo/v026/26.3kang.html "To Love and Be Loved: Considering Black Masculinity and the Misandric Impulse in Toni Morrison's "Beloved"], ''Callaloo'', Vol. 26, No. 3, pp. 836-854.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''Gender and Judaism: The Transformation of Tradition'', [[Harry Brod]], a Professor of Philosophy and Humanities in the Department of Philosophy and Religion at the [[University of Northern Iowa]], writes:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=SH8r3ntJG8AC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA279 ''Gender and Judaism: The Transformation of Tradition]'', Harry Brod&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In the introduction to ''The Great Comic Book Heroes'', Jules Feiffer writes that this is Superman's joke on the rest of us. Clark is Superman's vision of what other men are really like. We are scared, incompetent, and powerless, particularly around women. Though Feiffer took the joke good-naturedly, a more cynical response would see here the Kryptonian's misanthropy, his misandry embodied in Clark and his misogyny in his wish that Lois be enamored of Clark (much like Oberon takes out hostility toward Titania by having her fall in love with an ass in Shakespeare's ''Midsummer-Night's Dream'').}}

In 2020, the explicitly misandric essay ''[[Moi, les hommes, je les déteste]]'' (''I Hate Men'') by the French writer Pauline Harmange caused controversy in France after a government official threatened its publisher with criminal prosecution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=2020-09-08|title=French book I Hate Men sees sales boom after government adviser calls for ban|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/08/french-book-i-hate-men-sees-sales-boom-after-government-adviser-calls-for-ban-pauline-harmange|access-date=2020-09-10|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misandry and feminism==

[[Radical feminism]] has often been associated with misandry in the public consciousness. However, radical feminist arguments have also been misinterpreted, and individual radical feminists such as [[Valerie Solanas]], best known for her attempted murder of [[Andy Warhol]] in 1968, have historically had a higher profile in popular culture than within feminist scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Pilcher|first1=Jane|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DKaXe6LrKlIC&amp;pg=PT67|title=50 Key Concepts in Gender Studies|last2=Whelehan|first2=Imelda|date=2004-03-18|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-3207-3|location=|pages=67|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Payton|first=Joanne|date=2012|title=Book Review: Anthony Synnott Re-thinking Men: Heroes, Villains and Victims|url=|journal=Sociology|language=en|volume=46|issue=4|pages=767–768|doi=10.1177/0038038512444951|s2cid=146967261|issn=0038-0385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Alice Echols]], in her 1989 book ''Daring To Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967–1975'', argued that Valerie Solanas displayed an extreme level of misandry in her tract the ''[[SCUM Manifesto]]'', but noted that it was not typical for radical feminists of the time. Echols stated: "Solanas's unabashed misandry—especially her belief in men's biological inferiority—her endorsement of relationships between 'independent women,' and her dismissal of sex as 'the refuge of the mindless' contravened the sort of radical feminism which prevailed in most women's groups across the country."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Echols, Nicole. [[iarchive:daringtobebadrad0000echo/page/104|''Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967–1975'']]. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1989, pp. 104-105, {{ISBN|978-0-8166-1786-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Echols also noted, though, that after her attempted murder, Solanas' ''SCUM Manifesto'' became more popular within radical feminism, but not all radical feminists shared her beliefs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For example, radical feminist [[Andrea Dworkin]] criticized the [[biological determinist]] strand in radical feminism that, in 1977, she found "with increasing frequency in feminist circles" which echoed the views of Valerie Solanas that males are biologically inferior to women and violent by nature, requiring a [[gendercide]] to allow for the emergence of a "new ''Übermensch'' Womon".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Andrea|author-link=Andrea Dworkin|date=Summer 1978|title=Biological Superiority: The World's Most Dangerous and Deadly Idea|url=http://heresiesfilmproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/heresies6.pdf|journal=Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics|series=No. 2|volume=2|issue=#6|page=46|issn=0146-3411|access-date=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Individual viewpoints ===

==== bell hooks&lt;!-- The name bell hooks is not capitalized (see discussion) --&gt; ====
The author [[bell hooks]] conceptualized the issue of "man hating" during the early period of women's liberation as a reaction to patriarchal oppression and women who had bad experiences with men in non-feminist social movements. She also criticized separatist strands of feminism as "reactionary" for promoting the notion that men are inherently immoral, inferior, and unable to help end sexist oppression or benefit from feminism.&lt;ref&gt;hooks, bell. (1984), ''Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center'', South End Press; Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;hooks, bell. (2005), ''The Will To Change: Men, Masculinity and Love'', New York; Washington Square Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Feminism is For Everybody'', hooks laments the fact that feminists who critiqued anti-male bias in the early women's movement never gained mainstream media attention and that "our theoretical work critiquing the demonization of men as the enemy did not change the perspective of women who were anti-male." She has theorized previously that this demonization led to an unnecessary rift between the [[Men's movement]] and the [[Women's movement]].&lt;ref&gt;hooks, bell. Feminist Theory from Margin to Center. Boston, MA: South End, 1984. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Anthony Synnott ====
Anthony Synnott argues in his book ''Re-Thinking Men: Heroes, Villains and Victims'' that certain forms of [[feminism]] present misandristic view of gender. He argues that men are presented as having power over others regardless of the actual power they possess&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|161}} and that some feminists define the experience of being male inaccurately through writing on [[masculinity]]. He further argues that some forms of feminism create an [[In-group and out-group|in-group]] of women, simplifies the nuances of gender issues,  demonizes those who are not feminists and legimitizes victimization by way of retributive justice.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|162}}

Reviewing Synnott, Roman Kuhar argues that Synnott might not accurately represent the views of feminism, commenting that "whether it re-thinks men in a manner in which men have not been thought of in feminist theory, is another question."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuhar|first=Roman|title=Re-Thinking Men: Heroes, Villains and Victims|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0094306110391764ccc|journal=Contemporary Sociology: A Journal of Reviews|year=2011|volume=40|issue=1|pages=95–97|doi=10.1177/0094306110391764ccc|s2cid=144037921|issn=0094-3061|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nathanson and Young ====
Paul Nathanson and [[Katherine K. Young]] argued that "ideological feminism" as opposed to "egalitarian feminism" has imposed misandry on culture.{{sfn|Nathanson|Young|2001|p=xiv|ps=: "[ideological feminism,] one form of feminism—one that has had a great deal of influence, whether directly or indirectly, on both popular culture and elite culture—is profoundly misandric"}} Their 2001 book, ''Spreading Misandry'', analyzed "pop cultural artifacts and productions from the 1990s" from movies to greeting cards for what they considered to be pervasive messages of hatred toward men.{{sfn|Nathanson|Young|2001|page=ix}} ''Legalizing Misandry'' (2005), the second in the series, gave similar attention to laws in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Paul|last1=Nathanson|first2=Katherine K.|last2=Young|author-link2=Katherine K.

In the book ''[[Angry White Men]]'', [[Michael Kimmel]] argue that much of the misandry identified is actually criticising [[patriarchy]]&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kimmel, Michael S.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/852681950|title=Angry white men : American masculinity at the end of an era|date=5 November 2013|isbn=978-1-56858-696-0|location=New York|oclc=852681950}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|132}} and states "it is truly ridiculous to argue that feminists have managed to in-filtrate America’s political and cultural capitals to such an extent that they now have the political capacity to institutionalize misandry."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|130}} He comments that their reading of fiction is "bad history" and is based on "a heaping dose of dramatic misreading of texts, with no foundational understanding of how texts are actually experienced by consumer".

==== Individualist feminists ====
[[Wendy McElroy]], an [[individualist feminist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Wendy McElroy|url=http://www.independent.org/aboutus/person_detail.asp?id=488|website=The Independent Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote in 2001 that some feminists "have redefined the view of the movement of the opposite sex" as "a hot anger toward men [that] seems to have turned into a cold hatred."{{sfn|McElroy|2001|p=5}} She argued it was a misandrist position to consider men, as a class, to be irreformable or [[rape|rapists]].

In a 2016 article, individualist feminist [[Cathy Young]] described a "current cycle of misandry" in feminism.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite news|last=Young|first=Cathy|date=2016-07-04|title=Feminists treat men badly and it's bad for feminism|newspaper=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/06/30/feminists-treat-men-badly-its-bad-for-feminism|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cycle, she explains, includes the use of the term "[[mansplaining]]" and other neologisms using "man" as a derogatory prefix.&lt;ref name="Young" /&gt; The term "mansplaining", according to feminist writer [[Rebecca Solnit]], was coined soon after the appearance in 2008 of her essay ''[[Men Explain Things to Me]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solnit|first1=Rebecca|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781608464661|title=Men Explain Things to Me|date=2014|publisher=Haymarket Books|isbn=978-1-60846-457-9|location=Chicago IL|chapter=1|quote=The term "mansplaining" was coined soon after the piece appeared, and I was sometimes credited with it.

==Criticism of the concept==
===Asymmetry with misogyny===
{{Primary sources|section|date=September 2019}}
Sociologist [[Allan G. Johnson]] argues in ''[[The Gender Knot: Unraveling our Patriarchal Legacy]]'' that accusations of man-hating have been used to put down [[Feminism|feminists]] and to shift attention onto men, reinforcing a male-centered culture.&lt;ref name=Johnson107&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3nnxlqbN-IEC&amp;pg=PA107|page=107|title=The Gender Knot: Unraveling Our Patriarchal Legacy|edition= 2, revised|last=Johnson|first=Alan G.|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-1592133840}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson posits that culture offers no comparable anti-male ideology to [[misogyny]] and that "people often confuse men as individuals with men as a dominant and privileged category of people" and that "[given the] reality of women's oppression, male privilege, and men's enforcement of both, it's hardly surprising that ''every'' woman should have moments where she resents or even hates men".

Marc A. Ouellette argues in ''International Encyclopedia of Men and Masculinities'' that "misandry lacks the systemic, transhistoric, institutionalized, and legislated antipathy of misogyny"; in his view, assuming a parallel between misogyny and misandry overly simplifies relations of gender and power.&lt;ref name="Ouellette"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ouellette |first=Marc |editor1=Flood, Michael |editor1-link=Michael Flood |display-editors=etal |title=International Encyclopedia of Men and Masculinities |chapter=Misandry |pages=442–3 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T54J3Q_VwnIC&amp;q=misandry&amp;pg=PA442 |date=2007 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon, UK; New York, N.Y. |isbn=978-0-415-33343-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthropology|Anthropologist]] David D. Gilmore also argues that misogyny is a "near-universal phenomenon" and that there is no male equivalent to misogyny,&lt;ref name="gilmore"&gt;Gilmore, David G. ''Misogyny: The Male Malady''. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2009, pp. 10–13, {{ISBN|978-0-8122-1770-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; further defending manifestations of perceived misandry as not "hatred of men's traditional male role" and a "culture of machismo". He argues that misandry is "different from the intensely ''ad feminam'' aspect of misogyny that targets women no matter what they believe or do".&lt;ref name="gilmore"/&gt;

[[Michael Kimmel]] states of misogyny and misandry that "claiming some sort of equivalent parallel is, of course, utterly tendentious."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
