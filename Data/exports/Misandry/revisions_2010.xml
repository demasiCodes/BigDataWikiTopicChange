'''Misandry''' ({{pron-en|mɪˈsændri}}) is contempt of [[men]].
Misandry comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''misos'' (μῖσος, "hatred") and ''anēr'', ''andros'' (ἀνήρ, [[genitive|gen.]] ἀνδρός; "man"). It is not to be confused with the term [[misogyny]], the hatred of women or girls. Misandry is also comparable with (but not the same as) [[misanthropy]], which is the hatred of humanity in general.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Nathanson, Katherine K. Young, ''Spreading Misandry: The Teaching of Contempt for Men in Popular Culture'' (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2001), p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; The prefix ''[[miso-]]'' (meaning "hate") applies in many other words, such as ''[[misocapny]]'', ''[[wikt:misogamy|misogamy]]'', ''[[misarchy]]'', and ''[[misoxeny]]''. ''Misandry'' is the antonym of [[wikt:philandry|philandry]], the fondness towards men, love, or admiration of them.

==Misandry in literature==
=== Misandry in ancient Greek literature ===
Classics professor [[Froma Zeitlin]] of [[Princeton University]] discussed misandry in her article titled "Patterns of Gender in [[Aeschylus|Aeschylean]] Drama: Seven against Thebes and the Danaid Trilogy."&lt;ref name="Zeitlin" /&gt; She writes:
{{cquote|The most significant point of contact, however, between [[Eteocles]] and the suppliant [[Danaids]] is, in fact, their extreme positions with regard to the opposite sex: the misogyny of Eteocles’ outburst against all women of whatever variety (Se. 181-202) has its counterpart in the seeming '''misandry''' of the Danaids, who although opposed to their [[Egypt]]ian cousins in particular (marriage with them is [[incest]]uous, they are violent men) often extend their objections to include the race of males as a whole and view their cause as a passionate contest between the sexes (cf. Su. 29, 393, 487, 818, 951).&lt;ref name="Zeitlin"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Misandry and literary criticism ===
In his book, ''Gender and Judaism: The transformation of tradition'', Harry Brod, a Professor of Philosophy and Humanities in the Department of Philosophy and Religion at the [[University of Northern Iowa]], writes:
{{cquote|
In the introduction to ''The Great Comic Book Heroes'', Jules Feiffer writes that this is [[Superman]]'s joke on the rest of us. Clark is Superman's vision of what other men are really like. We are scared, incompetent, and powerless, particularly around women. Though Feiffer took the joke good-naturedly, a more cynical response would see here the Kryptonian's misanthropy, his misandry embodied in Clark and his misogyny in his wish that [[Lois Lane|Lois]] be enamored of Clark (much like [[Oberon]] takes out hostility toward [[Titania]] by having her fall in love with an ass in [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Midsummer-Night's Dream]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=SH8r3ntJG8AC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA279&amp;dq=greek+misandry&amp;ots=DIRIiG6cvR&amp;sig=RAkhjK9tDe9tKUt92TME85D7dL4 Gender and Judaism: The transformation of tradition], Harry Brod&lt;/ref&gt;

Julie M. Thompson, a [[feminist]] author, connects misandry with envy of men, in particular "[[penis envy]]", a term coined by [[Sigmund Freud]] in 1908, in his theory of female sexual development.&lt;ref&gt;

===Misandry and feminism===

[[Alice Echols]] argues that [[Radical feminism|radical feminist]] [[Valerie Solanas]] displayed misandry in her [[tract]] [[SCUM Manifesto]]. Echols states: 
{{quote|"Solanas’s unabashed misandry — especially her belief in men’s biological inferiority — her endorsement of relationships between ‘independent women,’ and her dismissal of sex as ‘the refuge of the mindless’ contravened the sort of radical feminism which prevailed in most women’s groups across the country."&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=6zaVkAjBuPEC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=alice+echols+valerie+solanas+misandry&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tY9qTInqK6egOI2QyMoB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;}} Some other researchers have argued that Solanas' [[SCUM Manifesto]] is a [[parody]] of [[patriarchy]] and the Freudian theory of femininity, where the word ''woman'' is replaced by ''man''. The text contains all the clichés of Freudian [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical]] theory: the biological accident, the incomplete sex and "penis envy" which has become "pussy envy.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=DYuBjJXGsZkC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Solanas+Freudian+psychoanalytical+theory+%22pussy+envy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=opRqTKzxGoKlON2UkOEB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Solanas%20Freudian%20psychoanalytical%20theory%20%22pussy%20envy%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=4bxltKXsftIC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=SCUM+Manifesto+parody&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lJVqTNnaF6acOJTBqY4J&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=SCUM%20Manifesto%20parody&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wendy McElroy]], an [[individualist feminist]] and [[Fox News]] commentator,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.org/aboutus/person_detail.asp?id=488 The Independent Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; argues that some feminists "have redefined the view of the movement of the opposite sex" as "a hot anger toward men seems to have turned into a cold hatred."&lt;ref name="McElroy-05"&gt;{{Harv|McElroy|2001|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that men as a class are considered irreformable, all men are considered [[rape|rapists]], and marriage, rape and [[prostitution]] are seen as the same. McElroy states "a new ideology has come to the forefront... radical or gender, feminism", one that has "joined hands with [the] [[political correctness]] movement that condemns the panorama of western civilization as sexist and racist: the product of '[[dead white males]].'"&lt;ref name="McElroy-04_6"&gt;{{Harv|McElroy|2001|pp=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Pundit (expert)|Pundit]] Charlotte Hays argues "that the anti-male philosophy of radical feminism has filtered into the culture at large is incontestable; indeed, this attitude has become so pervasive that we hardly notice it any longer."&lt;ref&gt;Hays, Charlotte. 'The Worse Half'. National Review 11 March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''The gender knot: unraveling our patriarchal legacy'', sociologist Allan G. Johnson states that accusations of man hating work to discredit feminism because people often confuse men as individuals with men as a dominant and privileged category of people. He argues that given the "reality of women's oppression, male privilege, and men's enforcement of both, it's hardly surprising that ''every'' woman should have moments where she resents or even hates 'men.'"&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=3nnxlqbN-IEC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=Allan+G.+Johnson+%22misandry%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OZhqTKTsIM-HOOz--Y0J&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

In the entry in the &lt;i&gt;Routledge Encyclopedia of Men and Masculinity&lt;/i&gt; (ed. [[Michael Flood]], et al), Marc A. Ouellette directly contrasts misandry and misogyny, arguing that "misandry lacks the systemic, transhistoric, institutionalized, and legislated antipathy of misogyny."&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=EUON2SYps-QC&amp;pg=PA442&amp;dq=michael+flood+misandry&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LDVbTMuhCoa6OK7p8d0N&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=michael%20flood%20misandry&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analogies to other forms of bigotry===
[[Masculism|Masculist]] writer [[Warren Farrell]] compares dehumanizing stereotyping of men to dehumanization of the [[Vietnamese people]] as "[[Gook#G|gooks]]".&lt;ref name=Farrell-1999&gt;{{cite book

Religious Studies professors [[Nathanson and Young|Paul Nathanson and Katherine Young]] make similar comparisons in their three-book series ''Beyond the Fall of Man'',&lt;ref name="NYspreading-4_6"&gt;{{Harv|Nathanson|Young|2001|pp=4–6}} "The same problem that long prevented mutual respect between [[Jew]]s and [[Christian]]s, the teaching of contempt, now prevents mutual respect between men and women."&lt;/ref&gt; which treats misandry as a form of prejudice and discrimination that has become institutionalized in [[North America]]n society. Nathanson and Young credit "ideological feminism" for imposing misandry on culture.&lt;ref name="NYspreading-xiv"&gt;{{Harv|Nathanson|Young|2001|p=xiv}} "[ideological feminism,] one form of feminism &amp;mdash; one that has had a great deal of influence, whether directly or indirectly, on both popular culture and elite culture&amp;mdash;is profoundly misandric."&lt;/ref&gt; 

Their book ''Spreading Misandry'' (2001) analyzes "[[pop culture|pop cultural]] artifacts and productions from the 1990s" from movies to greeting cards for what they consider contains pervasive messages of hatred toward men. ''Legalizing Misandry'' (2005) the second in the series, gives similar attention to laws in North America.
