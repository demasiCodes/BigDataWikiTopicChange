While usually ascribed to women, it is also possible for men to be misandrist.  Unlike misogyny, misandry has been little discussed or investigated.  Some [[Masculism|masculists]] maintain that misandry has been rampant for thirty years, due to feminist advocacy, and has become a social pathology. Some [[Feminism|feminists]] believe that, while misogyny is a social disease, misandry doesn't exist. Others in both feminist and masculist camps consider the "war of the sexes" arising from traditional gender roles to be a powerful source of both misogyny and misandry.
