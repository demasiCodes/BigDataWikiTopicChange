'''Misandry''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|s|æ|n|d|r|i}}) is the hatred of, contempt for, or prejudice against [[men]] or [[boys]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/234242?redirectedFrom=Misandry#eid "Misandry"] at Oxford English Dictionary Online (ODO), Third Edition, June 2002.

==Etymology==
Misandry is formed from the Greek ''misos'' (μῖσος, "hatred") and ''anēr'', ''andros'' (ἀνήρ, gen. ἀνδρός; "man").&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionaries http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/misandry&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the word can be found as far back as the 19th century, including an 1871 use in ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Misandry" the Word – Its Origin |url=http://unknownmisandry.blogspot.com/2011/02/misandry-word-its-origin.html|date=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Review of novel ''Blanche Seymour'', ''[[The Spectator]]'', London, 1 April 1871, p. 389. "We cannot, indeed, term her an absolute misandrist, as she fully admits the possibility, in most cases at least, of the reclamation of men from their naturally vicious and selfish state, though at the cost of so much trouble and vexation of spirit to women, that it is not quite clear whether she does not regard their existence as at best a mitigated evil".&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared in ''[[Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary]]'' (11th ed.) in 1952. Translation of the French {{lang|fr|misandrie}} to the German {{lang|de|Männerhass}} (Hatred of Men)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.pons.com/translate/german-english/M%C3%A4nnerha%C3%9F |title=Translations for Männerhaß in the German–English dictionary |publisher=PONS-Verlag|location=Stuttgart|work=Pons Dictionary German to English |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506132922/http://en.pons.com/translate/german-english/M%C3%A4nnerha%C3%9F |archivedate=6 May 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; is recorded in 1803.&lt;ref name="Krünitz1803"&gt;{{cite book|title=Oekonomische Encyklopädie oder allgemeines System der Staats-, Stadt-, Haus- u.

A term with a similar but distinct meaning is ''androphobia'', which constitutes fear of men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/misandry.htm | title=Misandry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Helen Pluckrose]] has argued that ''androphobia'' is the more propitious term in instances where aversion to men stems from a sense of fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://areomagazine.com/2017/10/17/androphobia-and-how-to-address-it/|title=Androphobia – and How to Address It|website=Areo|date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mirrors [[Camille Paglia]]'s argument that a close reading of historical texts reveals that men do not ''hate'' women but [[gynophobia|''fear'' them]].&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Paglia, Camille (1991).

==Overview==
[[Men's rights movement|Men's rights]] activists and other [[masculinist]] groups have criticized modern laws concerning [[divorce]], [[domestic violence]], and [[Rape shield law|rape]] as examples of institutional misandry.{{refn|name=Ouellette}}&lt;ref name="AtlanticSexism"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Berlatsky |first1=Noah |title=When Men Experience Sexism |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/05/when-men-experience-sexism/276355/ |website=The Atlantic |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly |date=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RavishlyMyth"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Thériault |first1=Anne |title=The Myth of Misandry |url=https://ravishly.com/2015/01/07/myth-misandry-misogyny-oppression-marginalization |website=Ravishly Media Company |publisher=Ravishly.com |accessdate=8 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious studies professors Paul Nathanson and [[Katherine K. Young|Katherine Young]] examined the institutionalization of misandry in the public sphere in their 2001 three-book series ''Beyond the Fall of Man'',{{sfn|Nathanson|Young|2001|pp=4–6}} which refers to misandry as a "form of prejudice and discrimination that has become institutionalized in North American society", writing, "The same problem that long prevented mutual respect between Jews and Christians, the teaching of contempt, now prevents mutual respect between men and women."{{sfn|Nathanson|Young|2001|page=6}}
==In literature==
===Ancient Greek literature===

Classics professor [[Froma Zeitlin]] of [[Princeton University]] discussed misandry in her article titled "Patterns of Gender in Aeschylean Drama: Seven against Thebes and the Danaid Trilogy".&lt;ref name="Zeitlin" /&gt; She writes:
{{quote|The most significant point of contact, however, between Eteocles and the suppliant Danaids is, in fact, their extreme positions with regard to the opposite sex: the misogyny of Eteocles' outburst against all women of whatever variety has its counterpart in the seeming misandry of the Danaids, who although opposed to their Egyptian cousins in particular (marriage with them is incestuous, they are violent men) often extend their objections to include the race of males as a whole and view their cause as a passionate contest between the sexes.&lt;ref name="Zeitlin"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Froma I.|last=Zeitlin|authorlink=Froma Zeitlin|title=Patterns of Gender in Aeschylean Drama: Seven against Thebes and the Danaid Trilogy|date=1 April 1990|journal=Cabinet of the Muses – Rosenmeyer Festschrift|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2j81390f}} Princeton University, paper given at the Department of Classics, University of California, Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Shakespeare ===

Literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] argued that even though the word misandry is relatively unheard of in literature it is not hard to find implicit, even explicit, misandry. In reference to the works of [[Shakespeare]] Bloom argued "I cannot think of one instance of misogyny whereas I would argue that misandry is a strong element. Shakespeare makes perfectly clear that women in general have to marry down and that men are narcissistic and not to be trusted and so forth. On the whole, he gives us a darker vision of human males than human females."&lt;ref&gt;Brockman, Elin Schoen. (25 July 1999) "In the Battle of the Sexes, This Word Is a Weapon", New York Times,  https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/25/weekinreview/in-the-battle-of-the-sexes-this-word-is-a-weapon.html?module=Search&amp;mabReward=relbias%3Ar&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern literature ===

[[Racialized]] misandry occurs in both "high" and "low" culture and literature. For instance, [[African-American]] men have often been disparagingly portrayed as either infantile or as eroticized and hyper-masculine, depending on prevailing cultural stereotypes.{{refn|name=Ouellette}}

Critic of mainstream feminism [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] has described [[Eve Ensler]]'s play ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'' as misandric in that "there are no admirable males&amp;nbsp;... the play presents a rogues' gallery of male brutes, sadists, child-molesters, genital mutilators, gang rapists and hateful little boys" which she finds out of step with the reality that "most men are not brutes. They are not oppressors".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aei.org/files/2008/11/19/20090108_ContemporaryFeminism.pdf "What's Wrong and What's Right with Contemporary Feminism?"], Hamilton College. Retrieved 2014-01-27. [[Christina Hoff Sommers|Sommers, Christina Hoff]].

Julie M. Thompson, a [[feminist]] author, connects misandry with envy of men, in particular "[[penis envy]]", a term coined by [[Sigmund Freud]] in 1908, in his theory of female sexual development.&lt;ref&gt;
Emphasis added. Julie M. Thompson, ''Mommy Queerest: Contemporary Rhetorics of Lesbian Maternal Identity'', (Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy Kang has discussed "the misandric impulse" in relation to the works of [[Toni Morrison]].&lt;ref&gt;Kang, N. (2003), [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/callaloo/v026/26.3kang.html "To Love and Be Loved: Considering Black Masculinity and the Misandric Impulse in Toni Morrison's "Beloved"], ''Callaloo'', Vol. 26, No. 3, pp. 836-854.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''Gender and Judaism: The Transformation of Tradition'', [[Harry Brod]], a Professor of [[Philosophy]] and [[Humanities]] in the Department of Philosophy and [[Religion]] at the [[University of Northern Iowa]], writes:

{{quote|In the introduction to ''The Great Comic Book Heroes'', Jules Feiffer writes that this is Superman's joke on the rest of us. Clark is Superman's vision of what other men are really like. We are scared, incompetent, and powerless, particularly around women. Though Feiffer took the joke good-naturedly, a more cynical response would see here the Kryptonian's misanthropy, his misandry embodied in Clark and his misogyny in his wish that Lois be enamored of Clark (much like Oberon takes out hostility toward Titania by having her fall in love with an ass in Shakespeare's ''Midsummer-Night's Dream'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=SH8r3ntJG8AC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA279 ''Gender and Judaism: The Transformation of Tradition]'', Harry Brod&lt;/ref&gt;}}In 2020, the explicitly misandric essay ''[[Moi, les hommes, je les déteste]]'' (''I Hate Men'') by the French writer Pauline Harmange caused controversy in France after a government official threatened its publisher with criminal prosecution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=2020-09-08|title=French book I Hate Men sees sales boom after government adviser calls for ban|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/08/french-book-i-hate-men-sees-sales-boom-after-government-adviser-calls-for-ban-pauline-harmange|access-date=2020-09-10|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
===Within feminist movements===
Academic [[Alice Echols]], in her 1989 book ''Daring To Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967–1975'', argued that the radical feminist [[Valerie Solanas]], best known for her attempted murder of [[Andy Warhol]] in 1968, displayed an extreme level of misandry compared to other radical feminists of the time in her tract the ''[[SCUM Manifesto]]''. Echols stated:

{{quote|Solanas's unabashed misandry—especially her belief in men's biological inferiority—her endorsement of relationships between 'independent women,' and her dismissal of sex as 'the refuge of the mindless' contravened the sort of radical feminism which prevailed in most women's groups across the country.&lt;ref&gt;Echols, Nicole. [https://archive.org/details/daringtobebadrad0000echo/page/104 ''Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967–1975'']. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1989, pp. 104-105, {{ISBN|978-0-8166-1786-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Andrea Dworkin]] criticized the [[biological determinist]] strand in [[radical feminism]] that, in 1977, she found "with increasing frequency in feminist circles" which echoed the views of Valerie Solanas that males are biologically inferior to women and violent by nature, requiring a [[gendercide]] to allow for the emergence of a "new ''Übermensch'' Womon".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://heresiesfilmproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/heresies6.pdf|title = Biological Superiority: The World's Most Dangerous and Deadly Idea|last = Dworkin|first = Andrea|date = Summer 1978|journal = Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics|access-date = 2015-05-12|issue = #6|series = No. 2|volume =  2|page =46|issn = 0146-3411|author-link = Andrea Dworkin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author [[bell hooks]] has discussed the issue of "man hating" during the early period of women's liberation as a reaction to patriarchal oppression and women who have had bad experiences with men in non-feminist social movements. She has also criticized separatist strands of feminism as "reactionary" for promoting the notion that men are inherently immoral, inferior, and unable to help end sexist oppression or benefit from feminism.&lt;ref&gt;hooks, bell. (1984), ''Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center'', South End Press; Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;hooks, bell. (2005), ''The Will To Change: Men, Masculinity and Love'', New York; Washington Square Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Feminism is For Everybody'', hooks laments the fact that feminists who critiqued anti-male bias in the early women's movement never gained mainstream media attention and that "our theoretical work critiquing the demonization of men as the enemy did not change the perspective of women who were anti-male." hooks has theorized previously that this demonization led to an unnecessary rift between the [[men's movement]] and the [[women's movement]].&lt;ref&gt;hooks, bell. Feminist Theory from Margin to Center. Boston, MA: South End, 1984. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although hooks doesn't name individual separatist theorists, [[Mary Daly]]'s utopian vision of a world in which men and heterosexual women have been eliminated is an extreme example of this tendency.&lt;ref&gt;Daly, Mary. (1998), ''Quintessence...Realizing The Archaic Future'', Beacon Press; Boston.&lt;/ref&gt; Daly argued that sexual equality between men and women was not possible and that women, due to their superior capacities, should rule men.&lt;ref&gt;Daly, Mary. (1990),  ''Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism'', Boston, Mass.: Beacon Press, pp. 384 &amp; 375–376&lt;/ref&gt; Yet later, in an interview, Daly argued "If life is to survive on this planet, there must be a decontamination of the Earth. I think this will be accompanied by an evolutionary process that will result in a drastic reduction of the population of males."&lt;ref&gt;Ridle, Susan (Fall/Winter 1999). "No Man's Land". ''EnlightenNext'' Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Nathanson and [[Katherine K. Young]] argued that "ideological feminism" as opposed to "egalitarian feminism" has imposed misandry on culture.{{sfn|Nathanson|Young|2001|p=xiv|ps=: "[ideological feminism,] one form of feminism—one that has had a great deal of influence, whether directly or indirectly, on both popular culture and elite culture—is profoundly misandric"}} Their 2001 book, ''Spreading Misandry'', analyzed "pop cultural artifacts and productions from the 1990s" from movies to greeting cards for what they considered to be pervasive messages of hatred toward men.{{sfn|Nathanson|Young|2001|page=ix}} ''Legalizing Misandry'' (2005), the second in the series, gave similar attention to laws in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Paul|last1=Nathanson|first2=Katherine K.|last2=Young|author-link2=Katherine K. Young|title=Legalizing Misandry: From Public Shame to Systemic Discrimination Against Men|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cqKxhhu55SMC|year=2006|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press – MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-5999-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wendy McElroy]], an [[individualist feminist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.org/aboutus/person_detail.asp?id=488|title=Wendy McElroy|website=The Independent Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote in 2001 that some feminists "have redefined the view of the movement of the opposite sex" as "a hot anger toward men [that] seems to have turned into a cold hatred."{{sfn|McElroy|2001|p=5}} She argued it was a misandrist position to consider men, as a class, to be irreformable or [[rape|rapists]].

In a 2016 article, author and journalist [[Cathy Young]] described a "current cycle of misandry" in feminism.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite news |last=Young |first=Cathy |date=2016-07-04 |title=Feminists treat men badly and it's bad for feminism |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/06/30/feminists-treat-men-badly-its-bad-for-feminism |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cycle, she explains, includes the use of the term "[[mansplaining]]" and other neologisms using "man" as a derogatory prefix.&lt;ref name="Young"/&gt; The term "mansplaining", according to feminist writer [[Rebecca Solnit]], was coined soon after the appearance in 2008 of her essay ''[[Men Explain Things to Me]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solnit|first1=Rebecca|title=Men Explain Things to Me|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781608464661|url-access=registration|date=2014|publisher=Haymarket Books|location=Chicago IL|isbn=978-1-60846-457-9|chapter=1|quote=The term "mansplaining" was coined soon after the piece appeared, and I was sometimes credited with it. In fact, I had nothing to do with its actual creation, though my essay, along with all the men who embodied the idea, apparently inspired it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of [[Sociology]] and author Anthony Synnott proposed the concept that misandry is further fueled and generated by misogyny and that the concept of challenging misandry can be viewed as opposing [[feminism]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/rethinking-men/201010/why-some-people-have-issues-men-misandry| title=Why Some People Have Issues With Men: Misandry| date=2010-10-10| last=Synnott| first=Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the increasing number of female-exclusive clubs and female-empowerment campaigns, Synnott states that this can cause an environment of male exclusion and cause contempt of men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/rethinking-men/201702/misandry-and-misogyny| title=Misandry AND Misogny| date=2017-02-09| last=Synnott| first=Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist and Media Lead of [[Green Party of England and Wales]] Miranda Larbi stated that feminists should make a larger effort of attempting to keep misandry out of feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2017/12/17/2018-need-make-effort-keep-misandry-feminism-7166537/|last=Larbi|first=Miranda|title=In 2018, we need to make more of an effort to keep misandry out of feminism|date=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Larbi, flaws of modern feminism include making issues such as [[sexual harassment]] gender-specific and valuing male experiences less than female experiences, which Larbi states undermines the objectives and intentions of feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foundationsoftruth.com/post/for-the-love-of-god-respect-men|title=For the Love of God...Respect Men!|website=foundationsoftruth.com|date=10 November 2019|author=Anon.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged asymmetry with misogyny===
{{Primary sources|section|date=September 2019}}
Sociologist [[Allan G. Johnson]] argues in ''[[The Gender Knot: Unraveling our Patriarchal Legacy]]'' that accusations of man-hating have been used to put down [[Feminism|feminists]] and to shift attention onto men, reinforcing a male-centered culture.&lt;ref name=Johnson107&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3nnxlqbN-IEC&amp;pg=PA107|page=107|title=The Gender Knot: Unraveling Our Patriarchal Legacy|edition= 2, revised|last=Johnson|first=Alan G.|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-1592133840}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson posits that culture offers no comparable anti-male ideology to [[misogyny]] and that "people often confuse men as individuals with men as a dominant and privileged category of people" and that "[given the] reality of women's oppression, male privilege, and men's enforcement of both, it's hardly surprising that ''every'' woman should have moments where she resents or even hates men".

Marc A. Ouellette argues in ''International Encyclopedia of Men and Masculinities'' that "misandry lacks the systemic, transhistoric, institutionalized, and legislated antipathy of misogyny"; in his view, assuming a parallel between misogyny and misandry overly simplifies relations of gender and power.&lt;ref name="Ouellette"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ouellette |first=Marc |editor1=Flood, Michael |editor1-link=Michael Flood |display-editors=etal |title=International Encyclopedia of Men and Masculinities |chapter=Misandry |pages=442–3 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=T54J3Q_VwnIC&amp;q=misandry&amp;pg=PA442 |date=2007 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon, UK; New York, N.Y. |isbn=978-0-415-33343-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthropology|Anthropologist]] David D. Gilmore also argues that misogyny is a "near-universal phenomenon" and that there is no male equivalent to misogyny,&lt;ref name="gilmore"&gt;Gilmore, David G. ''Misogyny: The Male Malady''. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2009, pp. 10–13, {{ISBN|978-0-8122-1770-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; further defending manifestations of perceived misandry as not "hatred of men's traditional male role" and a "culture of machismo". He argues that misandry is "different from the intensely ''ad feminam'' aspect of misogyny that targets women no matter what they believe or do".&lt;ref name="gilmore"/&gt;
