The use of '''Native American mascots''' in sports has been a contentious issue for many years in the United States of America.  Americans have had a long history of "playing Indian" that dates back to the 1700s.&lt;ref name="Calloway"&gt;First Peoples, Colin G. Calloway, 2nd Edition, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Many individuals admire the heroism and romanticism of the typical Native American image, but many view the use of college mascots as both offensive and demeaning. 

Despite the concerns that have been raised, many Native American mascots are still used in American sports from the elementary to the professional level.

==History==
During the 1960s, the [[National Congress of American Indians]] created a campaign to eliminate negative stereotyping of Indian people in the media.  They focused mainly on cartoons and movies; however their protests of sports organizations garnered the most attention.&lt;ref name="tolerance"&gt;Fight Hate and Promote Tolerance http://www.tolerance.org/news/article_tol.jsp?id=165  www.tolerance.org&lt;/ref&gt; The National Congress of American Indians has long been opposed to mascots that portray Indians in a negative light.  They feel that teams with mascots such as the Braves and the Redskins perpetuate negative stereotypes of Indian people, and demean their native traditions and rituals.&lt;ref name="NCAI"&gt;National Congress of American Indians http://www.ncai.org/ncai/resource/documents/governance/ncainews4.2.99.htm National Congress of American Indians
Applauds "Redskins" Trademark Cancellation&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of Native American mascots, however, believe that Native American mascots pay homage to these people and promote a better understanding of their cultures.&lt;ref name="tolerance" /&gt; Despite this issue emanating during the civil rights movement, it still continues today as many teams continues to possess mascots with controversial names and images.&lt;ref name="tolerance" /&gt;

==Varying degrees of offensiveness?==
[[Image:Redskins logo.gif|thumb|right|250px||The Washington Redskins Mascot]]
To further complicate this issue, many feel that there are varying levels of offensiveness with team names and mascots.  Anil Adyanthaya from the ''Boston Globe'' writes on June 5, 2005, "The use of Aztec or Seminole as a nickname by itself would not appear to be racist, as such names refer to a particular civilization rather than an entire race of people. In this way, they are no different from other school nicknames such as Trojans and Spartans (like Aztecs, ancient peoples) or [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish|Fighting Irish]] and Flying Dutchmen (like Seminoles, nationalities). Similarly, Warriors and Braves are no different from the fighting men of other cultures, like Vikings, Minutemen, or Musketeers (all current [[NCAA]] mascots, the first of which is also an [[NFL]] mascot) so it seems hard to argue that their use is uniquely demeaning in some way."&lt;ref name="globe"&gt; Boston Globe http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2005/06/05/sports_mascots_and_native_americans/ Sports, mascots, and Native Americans&lt;/ref&gt;. 

However, despite this varying degree of degradation, the NCAA, the ruling authority on college athletics, distributed a “self evaluation” in June of 2005, for teams to examine the use of potentially offensive imagery with their mascot choice.&lt;ref name="globe" /&gt; 

Some college teams, however, are changing their names and mascots without instruction of the NCAA.  Marquette University changed their name from the Warriors to the Golden Eagles in 1994.  The school’s president stated “we live in a different era than when the Warriors nickname was selected in 1954. The perspective of time has shown us that our actions, intended or not, can offend others. We must not knowingly act in a way that others will believe, based on their experience, to be an attack on their dignity as fellow human beings.”  Stonehill College also changed their mascot from the Chieftain to the Skyhawk “out of respect to Native American culture.”&lt;ref name="globe" /&gt; 

Additionally, teams that are not directly affected by this controversy have issued their opinions. The University of Wisconsin and the University of Iowa have both refused to schedule non-conference games against schools with Native American mascots.&lt;ref name="globe" /&gt; Ironically, the University of Iowa's own nickname, "Hawkeyes", has Native American origins (Iowa is the "[[Hawkeye State]]"), although the team uses a [[hawk]] as its symbol rather than an Indian.

The University of Oregon, following suit of the ''[[Oregonian]]'' newspaper, declined to refer to the University of Illinois team as the "Illini" in a basketball game in 2005. Illinois won the game 79-61.

==Argument supporting the use of Native American mascots==
Many individuals who support the use of Native American mascots state that they are meant to be respect and to pay homage to Native American people.  The argument is made that Native American mascots focus on bravery, courage and fighting skills rather than anything derogatory. Karl Swanson, vice-president of the Washington Redskins professional football team, declared in the magazine ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that his team's name "symbolizes courage, dignity, and leadership," and that the "Redskins symbolize the greatness and strength of a grand people."&lt;ref name="bar"&gt;New Jersey State Bar Foundation http://www.njsbf.org/njsbf/student/respect/winter03-1.cfm Native American Mascots: Racial Slur or Cherished Tradition?&lt;/ref&gt;

Others claim Native American mascots help promote the culture to those who might be unaware of its significance. [[Chief Illiniwek]], the mascot for the [[University of Illinois]], has been another figure who has come under scrutiny. However, in 1990 the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois called the mascot a “dignified” symbol: “His ceremonial dance is done with grace and beauty. The Chief keeps the memory of the people of a great Native American tribe alive for thousands of Illinoisans who otherwise would know little or nothing of them.”&lt;ref name="tolerance" /&gt;  However, the tribal dance and costume was not of the Illini confederacy, but that of the Lakota tribe. 

Steven Benson, director of diversity for [[Southern Methodist University]] and member of the [[Chickasaw]] nation feels that there are acceptable ways to use Native American mascots if it is done in a respectful and tasteful manner. He states, “I believe it is acceptable if used in a way that fosters understanding and increased positive awareness of the Native-American culture. And it must also be done with the support of the Native-American community. There is a way to achieve a partnership that works together to achieve mutually beneficial goals.”&lt;ref name="SMU"&gt;Red Orbit http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/153383/nativeamerican_nicknamesmascots/index.html Native-American Nicknames/Mascots&lt;/ref&gt;

The individuals who make these arguments are typically not Native Americans themselves.

==Argument opposing the use of Native American mascots==
Opponents of Native American mascots feel that the mascots breed insensitivity and misunderstanding about native people.  Opponents also highlight the seeming double standard for racial mascots where there are no mascots based on African Americans, Mexican Americans, or Asian Americans depicted in sports.&lt;ref name="AICS"&gt;American Indian Cultural Support http://www.aics.org/mascot/mascot.html MASCOTS - Racism in Schools by State&lt;/ref&gt;. The University of Notre Dame’s “Fighting Irish”.&lt;ref name="ND"&gt;University of Notre Dame http://und.cstv.com/trads/nd-m-fb-mas.html NOTRE DAME FIGHTING IRISH - Traditions&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette|University of Louisiana Lafayette]]'s "Ragin' Cajuns" are notable exceptions to the debate, as those schools selected symbols that represent ''themselves'' historically.

A big issue in the Native American mascot debate is the use of Indian mascots by elementary, middle and high school sports teams.  Opponents of Native American mascots feel that children should be exposed to realistic and positive portrayals of American Indians during their educational years.  Kathy Morning Star, director of the American Indian Cultural Support, states that "It is the responsibility of educators to set the example and teach the youth of today to respect other ethnic or minority peoples - NOT to exploit or disrespect them by using them as 'mascots' or stereotypical 'images' which perpetuates racism."&lt;ref name="AICS" /&gt;

Many opponents also take offense to proponents of Native American mascots that claim they are simply paying tribute to native people.  Considering many Native Americans’ stance on this issue, opponents of Native American mascots feel that the mascots should be deemed offensive by the people being imitated, not by those who are imitating.  Barbara Munson of the Oneida nation states "When someone says you are hurting them by your action, if you persist - then the harm becomes intentional."&lt;ref name="AICS" /&gt;

Opponents also deem it insensitive when unconscious phrases like “Kill the Indians” or “Murder the Redskins” are yelled during sporting events (the latter of which is particularly yelled by [[Dallas Cowboys|Cowboys]], [[Philadelphia Eagles|Eagles]], and [[New York Giants|Giants]] fans, due to [[Significant rivalries in the NFL#NFC East|long-standing NFL rivalries]]), referring to the team playing, but also creating a negative view of Native Americans.&lt;ref name="AICS" /&gt;

==Florida State Seminoles==
[[Image:FloridaStateSeminoles.png|thumb|right|250px||The Florida State University Mascot, Chief Osceola]]
The debate over the Florida Seminole mascot and symbol of [[Florida State University]] is an interesting case study because of its close ties to the Seminole nation of Florida.

In August of 2005, the NCAA granted Florida State University a waiver, which removed FSU from the NCAA’s list of colleges whose sports teams, it said, used “hostile or abusive” imagery towards Native Americans.  According to Bernard Franklin, senior vice president of the NCAA, "The staff review committee noted the unique relationship between the university and the Seminole Tribe of Florida as a significant factor.  The decision of a namesake sovereign tribe, regarding when and how its name and imagery can be used, must be respected even when others may not agree."&lt;ref name="seminole"&gt;USA Today http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/2005-08-23-fsu-mascot-approved_x.htm NCAA allowing Florida State to use its Seminole mascot&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seminole Tribe of Florida officially sanctions the use of the Seminole as Florida State University’s nickname and of Chief Osceola as FSU's mascot. Max Osceola, the chief and general council president of the Seminole Tribe of Florida, feels that it is an “honor” to be associated with the university.&lt;ref name="seminole" /&gt;

However, some Oklahoma Seminoles feel differently. General council member of the Seminole nation of Oklahoma David Narcomey stated "I am deeply appalled, incredulously disappointed ... I am nauseated that the NCAA is allowing this 'minstrel show' to carry on this form of racism in the 21st century." In 2005, Jennifer McBee, the Oklahoma Seminole tribe's attorney general, stated that the council has taken no official position on the FSU issue.&lt;ref name="seminole" /&gt; Despite the individual comments of some members of the Oklahoma Seminoles, Ken Chambers, principal chief of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma told ''The Palm Beach'' (Florida) ''Post'' in August 2005 that he had no objection to Florida State University using the Seminoles as a nickname and symbol, reversing the earlier public position of the Oklahoma tribe's spokesperson.&lt;ref name="usatoday_seminoles"&gt;http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/2005-08-11-fsu-mascot-support_x.htm Oklahoma Seminoles OK Name&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial impact of change==
Many supporters of Native American mascots feel that the financial cost of changing mascots would far outweigh the benefits.  Sales of merchandise with team mascots and nicknames ranging from t-shirts to beer coozies generate millions of dollars in sales each year, and teams contend that a change in team mascots would render this merchandise useless.&lt;ref name="bar" /&gt; 

Opponents, however, are unconcerned with the cost of changing and view mascots as caricatures of real Indians that do not honor them, but rather trivialize and demean important Indian dances and traditions.  Opponents feel that despite the cost of a change in team mascots, it should be done to prevent what they believe is racial stereotyping.  Clyde Bellecourt, the director of the American Indian Movement, stated "It's the behavior that accompanies all of this that's offensive.  The rubber tomahawks, the chicken feather headdresses, people wearing war paint and making these ridiculous war whoops with a tomahawk in one hand and a beer in the other-all of these have significant meaning for us. And the psychological impact it has, especially on our youth, is devastating."&lt;ref name="bar" /&gt;

Some major sports teams have changed their mascots for non-financial reasons.  Most notable were the [[Washington Bullets]], who in [[1995]] changed their mascot to the "Wizards" over concerns with violent connotations, and the [[Tennessee Oilers]], who in [[1999]] changed their mascot to the "Titans" a full two years after the team's move from [[Houston]].

==Current status==
The Native American mascot issue remains fiercely contested because of the plethora of Native American mascots still currently used in sports. According to the American Indian Cultural Support, as of 2006, at least 2,498 kindergarten, elementary, middle and high schools use Native American Indian mascots throughout the country.&lt;ref name="AICS" /&gt;

Though change has been made on the public school and college level, the professional arena has seen virtually none and still utilizes mascots such as the [[Chicago Blackhawks]], [[Washington Redskins]], [[Cleveland Indians]], [[Atlanta Braves]], [[Kansas City Chiefs]], and many others.&lt;ref name="AICS" /&gt; During the 2007 post-season, for example, [[Chief Wahoo]] was very visible, including being displayed in the stats line on the bottom of network television screens for both [[TBS]] and [[Fox Sports]].
