[[File:NotYourMascot2.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Protest against the name of the [[Washington Redskins]] in Minneapolis, Nov. 2014]]

The use of terms and images referring to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]/[[First Nations]] as the name or [[mascot]] for a sports team is a topic of public controversy in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. Since the 1960s, as part of the [[Native American civil rights|indigenous civil rights movements]], there have been a number of protests and other actions by Native Americans and their supporters targeting the more prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises such as the [[Cleveland Indians]] (in particular their "[[Chief Wahoo]]" logo); and the [[Washington Redskins]] (the term "[[Redskin (slang)|redskin]]s" being defined in most American English dictionaries as 'derogatory slang'). In 2017, when professional sports has dealt with a number of racial issues, from individual acts by players to widespread protests during the National Anthem, some commentators speculate why there has been no action to address the stereotyping of Native Americans, including the decision to have the Washington Redskins host a game on Thanksgiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0027-8378| last = Zirin| first = Dave| title = By Having the Washington R*dskins Host a Game on Thanksgiving, NFL Owners Show Their True Colors| magazine = The Nation| accessdate = November 24, 2017| date = November 17, 2017| url = https://www.thenation.com/article/by-having-the-washington-rdskins-host-a-game-on-thanksgiving-nfl-owners-show-their-true-colors/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = How have we not progressed past these mascots?| website = ESPN.com| author=Howard Bryant| accessdate = November 24, 2017| date = November 23, 2017| url = http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/21526838}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Alan Fisher|title=NFL team name causes outrage in the US| publisher=Al Jazeera|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/nfl-team-outrage-171124120007460.html|accessdate=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the visibility of national protests with no resolution, change has occurred locally in the trend by school and college teams retiring Native American names and mascots since the 1970s.

The issue is often discussed in the media only in terms of the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. This prevents a fuller understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why use of such names and images by sports teams should be eliminated.&lt;ref name="King.2010"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Native_American_Mascot_Controversy.html?id=GApQrXWeGLwC| editor=C.

Defenders of the current usage often state their intention to honor Native Americans by referring to positive traits, such as fighting spirit and being aggressive, brave, stoic, dedicated, and proud; while opponents see these traits as being based upon stereotypes of Native Americans as savages.&lt;ref name="Davis.2010"&gt;{{cite journal| issn = 10683844| volume = 9| issue = 4| pages = 11–14| last = Davis| first = Laurel R.| title = The problems with Native American mascots| journal = Multicultural Education| accessdate = October 10, 2017|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ649928}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the social sciences recognize that all stereotypes, whether positive or negative, are harmful because they promote false or misleading associations between a group and an attribute, fostering a disrespectful relationship. The injustice of such stereotypes is recognized with regard to other racial or ethnic groups, thus mascots are morally questionable regardless of offense being taken by individuals.&lt;ref name="Morris.2015"&gt;{{cite journal| author=S.P.

==History==
[[European American]]s have had a history of "playing Indian" that dates back to the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial period]]. In the 19th century, fraternal organizations such as the [[Tammanies|Tammany Societies]] and the [[Improved Order of Red Men]] adopted the words and material culture of Native Americans in part to establish an aboriginal identity, while ignoring the dispossession and conquest of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Deloria| first=Philip J.| year=1998| title=[[Playing Indian]]| location=New Haven| publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://yalebooks.com/book/9780300080674/playing-indian| title=Playing Indian| publisher=Yale University Press| accessdate=January 6, 2016| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630090119/http://yalebooks.com/book/9780300080674/playing-indian| archivedate=June 30, 2016| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice spread to youth groups such as the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) (in particular, the [[Order of the Arrow]]) and many summer camps. University students in the late 19th and early 20th centuries adopted Indian names and symbols for their sports teams, not from authentic sources but rather as Native American life was imagined by European Americans.&lt;ref name="Spindel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spindel|first=Carol|year=2002|title=Dancing at Halftime: Sports and the Controversy Over American Indian Mascots|location=New York|publisher=New York University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Dancing_at_Halftime.html?id=4p62ket04PgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional team nicknames had similar origins. In professional baseball the team that is now the [[Atlanta Braves]] was founded as the Boston Red Stockings in 1871; becoming the [[History of the Boston Braves|Boston Braves]] in 1912. Their owner at that time, [[James E. Gaffney|James Gaffney]], was a member of New York City's political machine, [[Tammany Hall]], one of the societies formed to honor [[Tamanend]], a chief of the [[Lenape|Delaware]]. The team that moved to become the [[Washington Redskins]] in 1937 was originally also known as the Boston Braves since the [[American football|football]] and baseball teams played at [[Braves Field]]. After moving to [[Fenway Park]], home of the [[Boston Red Sox]], the team name was changed to the Boston Redskins in 1933, using a "red" identifier while retaining the Braves "Indian Head" logo. While defenders of the Redskins often cite coach [[William Henry Dietz]], who claimed Native American heritage, to justify the name; the use of Native American names and imagery by this [[National Football League|NFL]] team began in 1932 before hiring Dietz in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/wasbos/bosskins.html|title=The Boston Redskins|accessdate=2013-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cleveland Indians]]' name originated from a request by club owner [[Charles Somers]] to baseball writers to choose a new name to replace the "Naps" following the departure of their star player [[Nap Lajoie]] after the 1914 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Baseball writers select "Indians" as the best name to apply to the former Naps |url= |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |location=Cleveland, Ohio |date=January 17, 1915 |access-date= |quote=With the going of Nap Lajoie to the Athletics, a new name had to be selected for the Cleveland American league club. President Somers invited the Cleveland baseball writers to make the selection. The title of Indians was their choice, it having been one of the names applied to the old National league club of Cleveland many years ago.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Indians" was chosen as it was one of the nicknames previously applied to the old [[Cleveland Spiders]] baseball club during the time when [[Louis Sockalexis]], a member of the [[Penobscot]] tribe of Maine, played for Cleveland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Looking Backwards |url= |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |location=Cleveland, Ohio |date=January 18, 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the Boston Braves in the [[1914 World Series]] may have been another reason for adopting an Indian mascot. The story that the team is named to honor Sockalexis, as the first Native American to play [[Major League Baseball]], cannot be verified from historical documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An Act of Honor or Exploitation?

The stereotyping of Native Americans must be understood in the context of history which includes conquest, forced relocation, and organized efforts to eradicate native cultures, such as the [[Native American boarding schools|boarding schools]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which separated young Native Americans from their families in order to educate them as European Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/policy/mascots-justif.pdf|title=APA Resolution Justifications|year=2005|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated in an editorial by Carter Meland ([[Anishinaabe]] heritage) and David E. Wilkins ([[Lumbee]]) both professors of [[Native American studies|American Indian Studies]] at the [[University of Minnesota]]: "Since the first Europeans made landfall in North America, native peoples have suffered under a weltering array of stereotypes, misconceptions and caricatures. Whether portrayed as ''[[noble savage]]s'', ''[[Stereotypes about indigenous peoples of North America|ignoble savages]]'', ''teary-eyed [[Environmentalism|environmentalists]]'' or, most recently, simply as ''casino-rich'', native peoples find their efforts to be treated with a measure of respect and integrity undermined by images that flatten complex tribal, historical and personal experience into one-dimensional representations that tells us more about the depicters than about the depicted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Star Tribune|title=Stereotypes in sports, chaos in federal policy|author=Carter Meland and David E.

In the 1940s the [[National Congress of American Indians]] (NCAI) created a campaign to eliminate negative stereotyping of Native American people in the media. Over time, the campaign began to focus on Indian names and mascots in sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hylton|first=J Gordon|title=BEFORE THE REDSKINS WERE THE REDSKINS: THE USE OF NATIVE AMERICAN TEAM NAMES IN THE FORMATIVE ERA OF AMERICAN SPORTS, 1857–1933|publisher=North Dakota law review|date=2010-01-01|volume=86|page=879| url=https://law.und.edu/_files/docs/ndlr/pdf/issues/86/4/86ndlr879.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCAI maintains that teams with mascots such as the [[Braves]] and the [[Redskin (slang)|Redskin]]s perpetuate negative stereotypes of Native American people, and demean their native traditions and rituals: "Often citing a long held myth by non-Native people that "Indian" mascots "honor Native people," American sports businesses such as the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Washington Redskins|Washington 'Redskins']] and [[Kansas City Chiefs|Kansas City 'Chiefs']], [[Major League Baseball|MLB]]'s [[Cleveland Indians|Cleveland 'Indians']] and [[Atlanta Braves|Atlanta 'Braves']], and the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]], continue to profit from harmful stereotypes originated during a time when white superiority and segregation were commonplace."&lt;ref name="NCAI.2013"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ncai.org/resources/ncai_publications/ending-the-legacy-of-racism-in-sports-the-era-of-harmful-indian-sports-mascots| title=Ending the Legacy of Racism in Sports &amp; the Era of Harmful Indian Sports Mascots| accessdate=October 10, 2017| publisher=NCAI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Policy Paper| url=http://www.ncai.org/attachments/policypaper_mijapmouwdbjqftjayzqwlqldrwzvsyfakbwthpmatcoroyolpn_ncai_harmful_mascots_report_ending_the_legacy_of_racism_10_2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vernon Bellecourt also founded the National Coalition Against Racism in Sports and Media (NCARSM) in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.coalitionagainstracism.org/about| title=About - National Coalition Against Racism in Sports and Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornel Pewewardy ([[Comanche]]-[[Kiowa]]), Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at [[Portland State University]], cites indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism which, by placing images of Native American or First Nations people into an invented media context, continues to maintain the superiority of the dominant culture.&lt;ref name="Pewewardy.1999"&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0710-1481| volume = 23| issue = 2| pages = 176–189| last = Pewewardy| first = Cornel| title = From enemy to mascot: The deculturation of Indian mascots in sports culture| journal = Canadian Journal of Native Education| accessdate = 2014-11-22| date = 1999| url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/230304174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such practices can be seen as a form of [[cultural imperialism]] or [[neocolonialism]].&lt;ref name="Longwell-Grice.2003"&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0027-6014| volume = 40| issue = 3| pages = 1–12| last1 = Longwell-Grice| first1 = Robert| last2 = Longwell-Grice|first2 = Hope |title = Chiefs, Braves, and Tomahawks: The Use of American Indians as University Mascots| journal = NASPA Journal (National Association of Student Personnel Administrators, Inc.)| accessdate = 2014-10-29| year = 2003 | url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ehh&amp;AN=32547562&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native mascots are also part of the larger issues of [[cultural appropriation]] and the violation of [[indigenous intellectual property]] rights, which includes all instances where non-natives use indigenous music, art, costumes, etc. in entertainment and commerce. It has been argued that harm to Native Americans occurs because the appropriation of Native culture by the majority society continues the systems of dominance and subordination that have been used to colonize, assimilate, and oppress indigenous groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Riley| first=Angela| title=Straight Stealing: Towards an Indigenous System of Cultural Property Protection| journal=Washington Law Review| volume=80| issue=69| date=2005| ssrn=703283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some see the use of caricatures of Native Americans as sports mascots as contributing to their political and economic [[Social exclusion|marginalization]]. Where other minorities would be consulted, decisions impacting Native Americans, such as building the [[Dakota Access Pipeline]], are made while excluding Native concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/beyond-standing-rock-the-native-american-economic_us_58b6e21de4b0e5fdf619792b| author=Dedrick Asante-Muhammad| title=Beyond Standing Rock: The Native American Economic Experience| quote=The U.S. has gained far too much from the marginalization of Native Americans| date=March 1, 2017| publisher=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all Native Americans are united in total opposition to mascots. Steven Denson, director of diversity for [[Southern Methodist University]] and member of the [[Chickasaw]] nation, while not issuing a blanket endorsement, has nevertheless stated that there are acceptable ways to use Native American mascots if it is done in a respectful and tasteful manner. He states: "I believe it is acceptable if used in a way that fosters understanding and increased positive awareness of the Native-American culture. And it must also be done with the support of the Native-American community. There is a way to achieve a partnership that works together to achieve mutually beneficial goals."&lt;ref name="SMU"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/153383/nativeamerican_nicknamesmascots/index.html| title=Native-American Nicknames/Mascots|publisher=Red Orbit| date=June 2, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCAI recognized the right of individual tribes to established relationships with teams which allowed them to retain their names.&lt;ref name="NCAI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncai.org/policy-issues/community-and-culture/anti-defamation-mascots|title=Anti-Defamation and Mascots|publisher=National Congress of American Indians|accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social sciences and education===

The harm done by the use of Native American mascots, particularly in an academic context, was stated by the Society of Indian Psychologists in 1999:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Stereotypical and historically inaccurate images of Indians in general interfere with learning about them by creating, supporting and maintaining oversimplified and inaccurate views of indigenous peoples and their cultures. When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information, they contribute to the development of cultural biases and prejudices, (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the University.) In the same vein, we believe that continuation of the use of Indians as symbols and mascots is incongruous with the philosophy espoused by many Americans as promoting inclusivity and diversity.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aiansip.org/uploads/SIP_Indian_Mascot_Position_Statement.pdf| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031052230/http://aiansip.org/uploads/SIP_Indian_Mascot_Position_Statement.pdf| archive-date=October 31, 2015|title=Society of Indian Psychologists|date=January 27, 1999|accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sports mascots have been cited as an example of [[Microaggression theory|microaggressions]], the everyday insults that members of marginalized minority groups are subject to in the comments and actions of other groups in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Microaggressions and Marginality: Manifestation, Dynamics, and Impact| author=Derald Wing Sue| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons| date=2010| page=384| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WZxpPnnjzkC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=sports+mascot+microaggression&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YeoTsr0Vy-&amp;sig=nl35tZtC0zkDMsBstdFa5ut4YiY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAmoVChMIrq2r2pqJxwIVAvMeCh2STAyE#v=onepage&amp;q=sports%20mascot%20microaggression&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) issued a resolution "Recommending the Immediate Retirement of American Indian Mascots, Symbols, Images, and Personalities by Schools, Colleges, Universities, Athletic Teams, and Organizations" due to the harm done by creating a hostile environment, the negative impact on the self-esteem of American Indian children, and discrimination that may violate civil rights. It also impacts non-natives by reinforcing mainstream stereotypes, preventing learning about Native American culture.

===Civil rights===

The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) passed a resolution calling for the end of the use of Native American names, images, and mascots in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aistm.org/naacp_1999_resolution.htm |title=NAACP 1999 Resolution |accessdate=2013-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128103322/http://www.aistm.org/naacp_1999_resolution.htm |archivedate=2012-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights|U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] released an advisory opinion calling for an end to the use of Native American images and team names by non-Native schools. While recognizing the right to freedom of expression, the commission also recognizes those Native Americans and civil rights advocates that maintain these mascots, by promoting stereotypes, may violate anti-discrimination laws. When found in educational institutions, mascots may also create a hostile environment inconsistent with learning to respect diverse cultures, but instead teach that stereotypes that misrepresent a minority group are permissible. Those schools that claim that their sports imagery stimulate interest in Native American culture have not listened to Native groups and civil rights leaders who point out that even purportedly positive stereotypes both present a false portrayal of the past and prevent understanding of contemporary Native people as fellow Americans.&lt;ref name=USCCR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccr.gov/press/archives/2001/041601st.htm |title=Statement of the United States Commission on Civil Rights on the use of Native American images and nicknames as sports symbols |accessdate=2016-12-10|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a report issued in 2012, a [[United Nations]] expert on Human Rights of Indigenous Peoples cited the continued use of Native American references by sports team as a part of the stereotyping that "obscures understanding of the reality of Native Americans today and instead help to keep alive racially discriminatory attitudes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14497&amp;LangID=E |title=USA: 'Redskins' Team mascot hurtful reminder of past suffering of Native Americans – UN rights expert |publisher=United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413145318/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14497&amp;LangID=E |archivedate=2014-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Murray Sinclair, the head of Canada's [[Truth and reconciliation commission|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] said in 2015 "sports teams with offensive names, such as Redskins and cartoonish aboriginal-looking mascots have no place in a country trying to come to grips with racism in its past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Stop using offensive indigenous mascots in sports, Justice Murray Sinclair says| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/11/15/stop-using-offensive-indigenous-mascots-in-sports-justice-murray-sinclair-says.html| first=Chinta| last=Puxley| publisher=The Toronto Star| date=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legal remedies====
While all advocates for elimination of Native mascots agree that the practice is morally wrong, many do not find a basis for legal remedy. Civil rights law in the United States reflect the difference between the experience of racism by [[African American]]s and Native Americans. The effects of slavery continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process. The difference is reflected in the continued popularity of Native Americans as mascots when similar usage of the names and images of any other ethnic group, in particular [[African American]]s, would be unthinkable, and the continued claim that the stereotype of the "noble savage" honors Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=56 |journal=UCLA Law Review |page=591 |title=Red: Racism and the American Indian |last=Berger |first=Bethany R. |year=2009 |url=http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-3-2.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423112932/http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-3-2.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, the [[Michigan Department of Civil Rights]] (MDCR) filed a complaint with the [[United States Department of Education|US Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]] (OCR). MDCR's complaint asserted that new research clearly establishes that use of American Indian imagery negatively impacts student learning, creating an unequal learning environment in violation of Article VI of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].&lt;ref name=MDCR&gt;{{cite web|title=Michigan Department of Civil Rights: Continued Use of American Indian Mascots Hurts Student Achievement |url=http://www.michigan.gov/mdcr/0,4613,7-138--294605--,00.html |publisher=State of Michigan |accessdate=23 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218160526/http://www.michigan.gov/mdcr/0%2C4613%2C7-138--294605--%2C00.html |archivedate=18 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, the OCR dismissed the case on the basis that the legal standard required not only harm, but the intent to do harm, which was not established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20130603/NEWS06/306030121/indian-mascot-ban-tossed-michigan| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605075801/http://www.freep.com/article/20130603/NEWS06/306030121/indian-mascot-ban-tossed-michigan| archive-date=June 5, 2013|title=Feds toss Michigan complaint to ban Indian mascots for sports teams|date=June 3, 2013|newspaper=The Detroit Free Press|first=Lori|last=Higgins|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A legal claim of discrimination rests upon a group agreeing that a particular term or practice is offensive, thus opponents of mascot change often point to individuals claiming Native American heritage who say they are not offended. This raised the difficulty of [[Native American identity in the United States]], also an evolving controversy.&lt;ref name="Morris.2015"/&gt;

===Religious organizations===

In 1992, the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] issued a resolution calling for the end of sports teams names that promote racism, in particular the Atlanta Braves and the Washington Redskins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccarnet.org/rabbis-speak/resolutions/1992/racism-1992/|title=Resolution Adopted by the CCAR: Racism|year=1992|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist Association]] passed a resolution to establish relationships with groups working to end the use of Indian images and symbols for sports and media mascots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uua.org/statements/resolution-establish-formal-relationships-national-coalition-racism-sports-and-media| title=Resolution to Establish Formal Relationships with the National Coalition on Racism in Sports and Media| accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the [[United Methodist Church]] also passed a resolution condemning the use of Native American team names and sports mascots, which was highlighted in a meeting of the Black caucus of that organization in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=5765541&amp;ct=3722449| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204042505/http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=5765541&amp;ct=3722449| archivedate=February 4, 2014|title=Black caucus joins Native American mascot fight|date=April 4, 2007|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umc-gbcs.org/faith-in-action/native-american-mascots-must-go |title=Native American mascots must go: Time to remove them is long passed |author=Rev.

A group of sixty-one religious leaders in Washington, D.C. sent a letter to NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] and Redskin's owner [[Daniel Snyder]] stating their moral obligation to join the Change the Mascot movement due to the offensive and inappropriate nature of the name which causes pain whether or not that is intended.&lt;ref name="faith"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/local/letter-to-goodell-and-snyder/695/|title=Letter to Goodell and Snyder|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/faith-leaders-urge-redskins-owner-dan-snyder-and-nfl-to-change-teams-name/2013/12/05/e1dad2be-5dd3-11e3-be07-006c776266ed_story.html|title=Faith leaders urge Redskins owner Dan Snyder and NFL to change team's name|first=Theresa|last=Vargas|date=December 5, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the Indian Affairs Committee of the Baltimore Yearly Meeting of the [[Quakers|Society of Friends]] approved a formal statement condemning the name of the Washington football team, stating that "the NFL has violated its core principles for decades by allowing the team playing in Washington, D.C., to carry the name 'redskins,' a racist epithet that insults millions of Native Americans. Continued use of the term encourages and perpetuates persecution, disrespect, and bigotry against Native men, women, and children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/29/quaker-indian-affairs-call-redskins-change-name-156099 |title=Quaker Indian Affairs Call for Redskins to Change Name |date=July 29, 2014 |publisher=Indian Country Today |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801010742/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/29/quaker-indian-affairs-call-redskins-change-name-156099 |archivedate=August 1, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Torch Committee, the student government organization of the [[Sandy Spring Friends School]] in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, voted to ban any apparel on the campus which includes the Redskins name, although the logo would continue to be allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/md-private-school-bans-use-of-the-r-word-on-campus-to-promote-equality/2015/02/13/bdbf769c-b394-11e4-854b-a38d13486ba1_story.html| title=Md. private school bans use of the 'R-word' on campus to promote equality| author1=Moriah Balingit| author2=John Woodrow Cox| date=February 13, 2015| newspaper=The Washington Post}}

In a meeting March 1, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Central Atlantic Conference of the [[United Church of Christ]] (UCC) unanimously passed a resolution proposing that its members boycott Washington Redskins games and shun products bearing the team's logo until the team changes its name and mascot. Redskin's spokesman [[Tony Wyllie]] offered a response, saying, "We respect those who disagree with our team's name, but we wish the United Church of Christ would listen to the voice of the overwhelming majority of Americans, including Native Americans, who support our name and understand it honors the heritage and tradition of the Native American community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/churches-propose-a-boycott-of-redskins-unless-the-team-change-its-name/2014/03/01/488669bc-a189-11e3-b8d8-94577ff66b28_story.html|title=Churches propose a boycott of Redskins unless the team changes its name|first=Carol|last=Morello|date=March 1, 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its annual meeting in June 2014, the membership of the UCC also passed a resolution supporting the boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nativenewsonline.net/currents/united-church-christ-central-atlantic-conference-passes-resolution-calling-washington-nfl-team-name-change-calls-member-boycott/|title=UCC Central Atlantic Conference Passes Resolution Calling for Washington NFL Team Name Change &amp; Calls for Member Boycott|date=June 15, 2014|publisher=Native News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/redskins/2014/06/14/church-of-christ-boycott-washington-redskins-name/10524269/|title=Church group latest to boycott Redskins over name|first=Erik|last=Brady|date=June 14, 2014|newspaper=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution and boycott was passed by the National Synod of the UCC in June, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.19actionnews.com/story/29433519/cleveland-church-calling-on-the-washington-redskins-to-change-its-name-logo| title=Cleveland church calls on Washington Redskins to change name, logo| date=June 29, 2015| first=Scott| last=Taylor| publisher=19 Action News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream opinion reflects the function of identification with a sports team in both individual and group psychology. There are many benefits associated with sports fandom, both private (increased self-esteem) and public (community solidarity). The activity of viewing sporting events provide shared experiences that reinforce personal and group identification with a team. The name, mascot, cheerleaders, and marching band performances reinforce and become associated with these shared experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.athleticinsight.com/Vol5Iss2/FanDevelopment.htm| title=The Social Psychology of the Creation of a Sports Fan Identity: A Theoretical Review of the Literature| author=Beth Jacobson |publisher=Athletic Insight - The Online Journal of Sports Psychology| date=2003| accessdate=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Snyder explicitly invokes these associations with family, friends, and an 81-year tradition as being the most important reasons for keeping the Redskins name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Letter from Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder to fans| date= October 9, 2013| publisher=The Washington Post| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/letter-from-washington-redskins-owner-dan-snyder-to-fans/2013/10/09/e7670ba0-30fe-11e3-8627-c5d7de0a046b_story.html| accessdate=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When self-esteem becomes bound to the players and the team, there are many beneficial but also some unfortunate consequences, including denial or rationalization of misbehavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-psychology-of-why-sports-fans-see-their-teams-as-extensions-of-themselves/2015/01/30/521e0464-a816-11e4-a06b-9df2002b86a0_story.html| title=The psychology of why sports fans see their teams as extensions of themselves| author=Eric Simons | date=January 30, 2015| publisher=The Washington Post| accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for some, the identity being expressed is one of supremacy, with the defense of native mascots clearly racist.&lt;ref name="Banks.1993"/&gt;

Some individuals who support the use of Native American mascots state that they are meant to be respectful, and to pay homage to Native American people. Many have made the argument that Native American mascots focus on bravery, courage and fighting skills rather than anything derogatory. Karl Swanson, then vice-president of the Washington Redskins professional football team, declared in the magazine ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that his team's name "symbolizes courage, dignity, and leadership", and that the "Redskins symbolize the greatness and strength of a grand people".&lt;ref name="bar"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Emert| first=Phyllis Raybin|year=2003| url=http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11134/Respect%20Winter%202003.pdf| title=Native American Mascots: Racial Slur or Cherished Tradition?| journal=Respect (newsletter)| publisher=New Jersey State Bar Foundation|volume=2| issue=2 (Winter 2003)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many note that the behavior of fans at games is not respectful. [[Richard Lapchick]], director emeritus of Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society, in an article: "Could you imagine people mocking African Americans in [[Blackface|black face]] at a game? Yet go to a game where there is a team with an Indian name and you will see fans with [[Body painting|war paint]] on their faces. Is this not the equivalent to black face?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lapchick/050825&amp;num=0|title=Mascots are a matter of respect|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others claim Native American mascots help promote the culture to those who might be unaware of its significance. [[Chief Illiniwek]], the former athletic symbol for the [[University of Illinois]], became the subject of protest in 1988.&lt;ref name="Spindel"/&gt; In 1990 the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois called the mascot a dignified symbol: "His ceremonial dance is done with grace and beauty. The Chief keeps the memory of the people of a great Native American tribe alive for thousands of Illinoisans who otherwise would know little or nothing of them. However, the tribal costume was not of the [[Illinois Confederation]], but that of the [[Lakota people|Lakota tribe]]. The [[Peoria (tribe)|Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma]] is the closest living descendants of the Illiniwek Confederacy. In response to requests by former Chief Illiniwek portrayer's to bring back occasional performances, Peoria Chief John P.

====Other team names and ethnic groups====
Many argue there is a double standard in Native Americans being so frequently used as a sports team name or mascot when the same usage would be unthinkable for other racial or ethnic group. One current exception is the [[Coachella Valley High School]] "Arabs"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/07/arab-team-mascot-ethnic-slur/3461059/|title=California high school's Arab mascot draws ire|date=November 7, 2013|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has also been the subject of controversy, resulting in the retirement of its more cartoonish representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/education/2014/09/09/mighty-arab-coachella-valley-high/15368751/|title='Mighty Arab' takes its place at Coachella Valley High|first=Brett|last=Kelman|newspaper=The Desert Sun|date=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Notre Dame]] [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish|Fighting Irish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1556389-should-the-notre-dame-fighting-irish-leprechaun-logo-be-banned-by-the-ncaa| title=Should the Notre Dame Fighting Irish Leprechaun Logo Be Banned by the NCAA?| author=Jason S.

However, rather than referring to "others" these teams employ symbols that European American cultures have historically used to represent themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=

Opponents also see this argument as a false equivalency, because it ignores systemic inequality, and serves to discount the Native American voice by saying that if one group isn't hurt by a particular portrayal, then no group has the right to be hurt, regardless of vastly different backgrounds, treatment, and social positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2008/10/05/notre-dames-fighting-irish-mascot|title=Sociological Images| author=Gwen Sharp, PhD| date=October 5, 2008| publisher=The Society Pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Commission on Civil Rights|U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] call for an end to the use of Native American mascots was only for non-native schools.&lt;ref name=USCCR/&gt; In cases where universities were founded to educate Native Americans, such mascots may not be examples of [[cultural appropriation]] or stereotyping. Examples include the [[Haskell Indian Nations Fighting Indians|Fighting Indians]] of the [[Haskell Indian Nations University]] and the [[University of North Carolina at Pembroke]] (UNCP), which continues to have a substantial number of native students, and close ties to the [[Lumbee]] tribe. The UNCP nickname is the [[UNC Pembroke Braves football|Braves]], but the mascot is a [[red-tailed hawk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncp.edu/news/2005/braves_nickname.htm|title=NCAA: UNCP will keep the Braves|date=August 9, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051222114740/http://www.uncp.edu/news/2005/braves_nickname.htm| archivedate=December 22, 2005|accessdate=December 8, 2016|publisher=University of North Carolina at Pembroke}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcac-naia.org/members.php |title=Member institutions |author= |website=Midlands Collegiate Athletic Conference |access-date=18 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328075846/http://www.mcac-naia.org/members.php |archivedate=28 March 2015 |df= }}

====Financial impact of change====
Many supporters of Native American mascots feel that the financial cost of changing mascots would far outweigh the benefits. Sales of merchandise with team mascots and nicknames ranging from T-shirts to beer cozies generate millions of dollars in sales each year, and teams contend that a change in team mascots would render this merchandise useless.&lt;ref name="bar"/&gt; The cost of removing images from uniforms and all other items, which must be paid out of local school funds, is a greater factor for secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mailtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120518/NEWS/205180322|title=State bans Native American mascots|date=May 18, 2012|first=Sanne|last=Specht|newspaper=Mail Tribune|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents feel that despite the cost of a change in team mascots, it should be done to prevent what they believe is racial stereotyping. [[Clyde Bellecourt]], when director of the [[American Indian Movement]] stated: "It's the behavior that accompanies all of this that's offensive. The rubber [[Tomahawk (axe)|tomahawks]], the chicken [[War bonnet|feather headdresses]], people wearing [[Body painting|war paint]] and making these ridiculous [[Battle cry|war whoops]] with a tomahawk in one hand and a beer in the other; all of these have significant meaning for us. And the psychological impact it has, especially on our youth, is devastating."&lt;ref name="bar"/&gt;

A study done by the [[Emory University]] [[Goizueta Business School]] indicates that the growing unpopularity of Native American mascots is a financial drain for professional teams, losing money compared to more popular animal mascots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.emory.edu/sportsmarketing/2013/12/19/the-financial-impact-of-mascots-on-sports-brands/?_ga=1.256951951.500422532.1397069844b|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020044121/https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/esma/2013/12/19/the-financial-impact-of-mascots-on-sports-brands/?_ga=1.256951951.500422532.1397069844b| archivedate=October 20, 2014| title=The Financial Impact of Mascots on Sports Brands|publisher=Emory University|date=December 19, 2013|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public opinion surveys====
{{also|Washington Redskins name opinion polls}}
A survey conducted in 2002 by [[Harris Interactive|The Harris Poll]] for [[Sports Illustrated]] (SI) found that 81 percent of Native Americans who live outside traditional Indian reservations and 53 percent of Indians on reservations did not find the images discriminatory. The authors of the article concluded that "Although most Native American activists and tribal leaders consider Indian team names and mascots offensive, neither Native Americans in general nor a cross section of U.S. sports fans agree". According to the article, "There is a near total disconnect between Indian activists and the Native American population on this issue." An Indian activist commented on the results saying "that Native Americans' self-esteem has fallen so low that they don't even know when they're being insulted".&lt;ref name=PriceWoo&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.si.com/vault/2002/03/04/8100154/the-indian-wars-the-campaign-against-indian-nicknames-and-mascots-presumes-that-they-offend-native-americansbut-do-they-we-took-a-poll-and-you-wont-believe-the-results| author = S.L. Price| title = The Indian Wars| work = Sports Illustrated| date = March 4, 2002| pages=66–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the SI article, a group of five social scientists experienced in researching the mascot issue published a journal article arguing against the validity of this survey and its conclusions. First they state that "The confidence with which the magazine asserts that a 'disconnect' between Native American activists and Native Americans exists on this issue belies the serious errors in logic and accuracy made in the simplistic labeling of Native Americans who oppose mascots as 'activists.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jss.sagepub.com/content/26/4/381|title=Of Polls and Race Predudice|doi=10.1177/0193732502238255|journal=Journal of Sport and Social Issues|date=November 2002|volume=26|issue=4|page=381|author1=C.

More recent surveys, rather than addressing the larger issue, have targeted the controversy over the name of the Washington Redskins, asking if the word is offensive or if it should be changed. By a large majority (71–89 percent), public opinion has maintained that the name should not change. However, more than half (53–59 percent) agree that "redskin" is not an appropriate term for Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=b41b9bde-1b19-40f7-af86-0b585eb8df03| title=Results of SurveyUSA News Poll #20802| date=October 15, 2013| accessdate=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/06/25/National-Politics/Polling/release_246.xml?44|title=Should the Washington Redskins change their name?|date=July 30, 2013|accessdate=October 16, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wusa9.com/longform/sports/nfl/2014/09/25/nfl-washington-redskins-name-survey-dc-maryland-virginia-response/16098841/|title=DC Speaks: Keep Redskins name|author=Greg Cohen|publisher=WUSA|date=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey most frequently cited by opponents of change as definitive of Native American opinion was performed in 2004 as part of the [[National Annenberg Election Survey]]. Among other questions regarding election year issues, respondents who identified themselves as being Native American were asked: "The professional football team in Washington calls itself the Washington Redskins. As a Native American, do you find that name offensive or doesn't it bother you?" In response, ninety percent replied that the name did not bother them, while nine percent said that it was offensive, and one percent would not answer.&lt;ref name="Annenberg.20140927"&gt;{{cite web |author=Kathleen Hall Jamieson Ph.D. |title=Most Indians Say Name of Washington "Redskins" Is Acceptable While 9 Percent Call It Offensive |url=http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/most-indians-say-name-of-washington-redskins-is-acceptable-while-9-percent-call-it-offensive/ |website=The Annenberg Public Policy Center |accessdate=September 27, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014154005/http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/most-indians-say-name-of-washington-redskins-is-acceptable-while-9-percent-call-it-offensive/ |archivedate=October 14, 2013 |deadurl=no |date=September 24, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The methods used in this survey and the conclusions that can be drawn from it have been criticized by social scientists,&lt;ref name="too"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Charles Springwood|title='I'm Indian Too!': Claiming Native American Identity, Crafting Authority in Mascot Debates|publisher=Journal of Sport and Social Issues|date=February 2004|volume=28|page=56|issue=1|doi=10.1177/0193732503261477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native American scholars&lt;ref name="ClarkD.2005"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Indigenous Voice and Vision as Commodity in a Mass-Consumption Society: The Colonial Politics of Public Opinion Polling|author=D.

In May 2016, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' essentially replicated the Annenberg poll, getting the same results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/new-poll-finds-9-in-10-native-americans-arent-offended-by-redskins-name/2016/05/18/3ea11cfa-161a-11e6-924d-838753295f9a_story.html | title=New poll finds 9 in 10 Native Americans aren’t offended by Redskins name | work=Washington Post | date=19 May 2016 | accessdate=19 May 2016 | author=Cox, John Woodrow}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/how-the-washington-post-conducted-the-survey-on-the-redskins-name/2016/05/19/98c0a4ae-1b8c-11e6-9c81-4be1c14fb8c8_story.html| title=How The Washington Post conducted the survey on the Redskins’ name| author1=Scott Clement| author2=Emily Guskin| date=May 19, 2016| publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/washington-post-poll-of-native-americans-on-redskins-team-name/2032/| title=Washington Post poll of Native Americans on Redskins' team name - Survey conducted December 16, 2015 to April 12, 2016| accessdate=May 24, 2016| publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; While attempting to address some of the flaws in the earlier poll it received many of the same criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nativeappropriations.com/2016/05/wapos-new-redskns-survey.html| title=WaPo’s new Redsk*ns survey: Faulty data and missing the point| author=Dr. Adrienne Keene, EdD| date=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ncai.org/news/articles/2016/05/19/ncai-response-to-new-poll-on-r-skins-team-name| title=NCAI Response to New Poll on R*skins Team Name | date=May 19, 2016| accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.naja.com/news/m.blog/509/naja-and-unity-respond-to-recent-washington-nfl-team-name-poll| title=NAJA and UNITY respond to recent Washington NFL team name poll| date=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A flaw unique to polls of Native Americans is they rely upon self-identification to select the target population. In an editorial in the [[The Herald-Times|Bloomington Herald Times]], Steve Russell (an enrolled [[Cherokee]] citizen and associate professor of criminal justice at [[Indiana University]]), states that both SI and Annenberg's samples of "self-identified Native Americans&amp;nbsp;... includes plenty of people who have nothing to do with Indians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iupui.edu/~mstd/e320/amerind/flap.html|title=Some collected materials about the NCAA's decision to ban Indian sports mascots from the Indianapolis area|accessdate=January 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals claiming to be Native American when they are not is well known in academic research, and people claiming Indian identity specifically to gain authority in the debate over sports mascots has been criticised.&lt;ref name="too" /&gt;

At the Center for Indigenous Peoples Studies at [[California State University]], San Bernardino a survey has conducted of 400 individuals whose identity as Native American was verified, finding that 67% agreed with the statement that "Redskins" is offensive and racist. The response from non-natives was almost the opposite, with 68% responding that the name is not offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/lindseyadler/native-americans-offended-by-racial-slur|title=New Study Finds 67% Of Native Americans Find Redskins Name Offensive|publisher=Buzzfeed.com|date=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cips.csusb.edu/docs/PressRelease.pdf|title=Survey on Redskins team name found most American Indians believe it to be offensive and racist.|accessdate=June 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends==
&lt;!--As in the lead section, this is a summary of the sections that follow, and thus does not include references for each statement.--&gt;

While protests began in the 1970s, national attention to the issue did not occur until widespread television coverage of college and professional games brought the behaviour of some fans to the attention of Native Americans. The appearance of the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the [[1991 World Series]] and the [[Washington Redskins]] at the 1992 [[Super Bowl XXVI|Super Bowl]] prompted the largest response because the games were played in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], which has a large Native American population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://miamioh.edu/about-miami/diversity/miami-tribe-relations/mascot-story/native-mascots/index.html| title=Native Mascots Become a National Controversy | publisher=Miami University of Ohio| accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documents most often cited to justifying the elimination of Native mascots are the advisory opinion by the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] in 2001 and a resolution by the [[American Psychological Association]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=APA/&gt;&lt;ref name=USCCR/&gt; Neither of these documents refer to subjective perceptions of offensiveness, but to scientific evidence of harms and legal definitions of discrimination. However, the issue is often discussed in the media in terms of feelings and opinions, and prevents full understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images and why their use by sports teams should be eliminated.&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;{{cite book|editor=C. Richard King|title=The Native American Mascot Controversy: A Handbook|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Maryland|year=2010|isbn=978-0-8108-6731-4|page=1| chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual school districts have responded to complaints by local Native American individuals and tribes, or have made changes due to an increased awareness of the issue among educators and students. New Native mascots have not been proposed in recent decades, or are withdrawn before becoming official due to public opposition. For example, in 2016 when one of the teams in the [[National College Prospects Hockey League]] (NCPHL) was announced as the Lake Erie Warriors with a caricature Mohawk logo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/07/28/social-media-blasts-lake-erie-warriors-over-racist-logo-165302| title=Social Media Blasts Lake Erie Warriors Over Racist Logo| first=Vincent| last=Schilling| date=July 28, 2016| publisher=Indian Country Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was immediate changed to the Lake Erie Eagles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uni-watch.com/2016/07/30/lake-erie-warriors-renamed-lake-erie-eagles-probably/ |title=Lake Erie Warriors Renamed Lake Erie Eagles (probably)| first=Paul| last=Lukas| date=July 30, 2016| publisher=Uni-Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal and administrative action===
{{main|Native American mascot laws and regulations}}
Statewide laws or school board decisions regarding team names and mascots have passed in states with significant Native American populations; including California (2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB30| title=AB-30 School or athletic team names: California Racial Mascots Act. | accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado (2014),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://coloradopolitics.com/995638-american-indian-mascot-bill-dies-committee/

===Secondary schools and youth leagues===
[[Secondary schools]] in both the United States and Canada have had histories similar to colleges, some making voluntary changes while others maintain their current mascots.

An analysis of a database in 2013 indicates that there are currently more than 2,000 high schools with mascots that reference Native American culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Munguia|first1=Hayley|title=The 2,128 Native American Mascots People Aren't Talking About|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-2128-native-american-mascots-people-arent-talking-about/|website=fivethirtyeight.com|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to around 3,000 fifty years ago.&lt;ref name="NCAI"/&gt; While 28 high schools dropped the name "Redskins" in the 25 years between 1988 and mid-2013, 14 schools changed the name in the years since.

The Department of Educational Foundations at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] passed a resolution calling for the retirement of all school mascots and logos that depict [[First Nations]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/staff-at-saskatchewan-university-calls-for-end-of-first-nations-logos-mascots-1.1546812|title=Staff at Saskatchewan university calls for end of First Nations logos, mascots|publisher=CTVNews.ca|date=November 16, 2013|accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to moving to changing their own mascots, school boards in Ontario are also considering a ban on students wearing any articles bearing offensive names or logos, be they professional or local teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/yourtoronto/education/2016/02/24/school-boards-onside-with-move-to-ban-racist-logos.html| title=School boards onside with move to ban 'racist logos'| first=Kristin| last=Rushowy| date=February 24, 2016| publisher=The Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ian Champeau, an [[Ojibway]] man in [[Ottawa]], Ontario, filed a human rights complaint against the Nepean Redskins Football Club on behalf of his five-year-old daughter in an effort to get the team to change its name. "How are they going to differentiate the playing field from the school yard? What's going to stop them from calling my daughter a redskin in the school yard? That's as offensive as using the [[Nigger#The N-word euphemism|n-word]]." [[Assembly of First Nations]] National Chief [[Shawn Atleo]] said he supports the move because the word ''Redskin'' is "offensive and hurtful and completely inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/09/04/redskins-human-rights-complaint-a-tribe-called-red_n_3866220.html|title=Nepean Redskins Human Rights Complaint: A Tribe Called Red Member Takes Football To Tribunal| publisher=HuffPost Canada Music| first=Jason| last=MacNeil| date=September 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team was changed to the "Nepean Eagles", chosen from 70 suggestions submitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/sunnews/sports/archives/2014/01/20140114-112929.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213035125/http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/sunnews/sports/archives/2014/01/20140114-112929.html| archivedate=February 13, 2015||title=Nepean Redskins says changing its 'controversial' name to cost about $100Gs|date=January 14, 2014|publisher=Sun News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niigaan Sinclair ([[Anishinaabe]]), a writer and assistant professor at the [[University of Manitoba]], applauded the decision and contrasted it to the decision of [[Daniel Snyder]], the Washington team owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/no-honour-in-native-names-238687531.html|title=No 'honour' in native names|first=Niigaan|last=Sinclair|date=January 4, 2014|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the Swift Current Indians baseball club became the [[Swift Current 57's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/3173209/swift-current-baseball-team-changes-name-from-indians-to-57s/ |title=Swift Current baseball team changes name from "Indians" to "57's" |last=Huffman |first=Alexa |date=January 10, 2017 |work=Global News |access-date=February 28, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301093515/http://globalnews.ca/news/3173209/swift-current-baseball-team-changes-name-from-indians-to-57s/ |archivedate=March 1, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{further information|Sports teams named Redskins|List of secondary school sports team names and mascots derived from the indigenous peoples of North America|l1=Sports teams named Redskins|l2=List of secondary schools using Native American names or mascots}}
In January 2014 the [[Nez Perce people|Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee]] sent a letter to two northern Idaho school districts with American Indian mascots asking that they be changed. The mascots are the Sacajawea Junior High Braves in [[Lewiston School District|Lewiston]] and the [[Nezperce, Idaho|Nezperce]] High School Indians. The school officials state that they will have meetings and gather public opinions before making a decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/world/57451183-68/board-district-lewiston-mascot.html.csp|title= At request of American Indians, Idaho schools eye mascot name change|author=The Associated Press|date=January 26, 2014|publisher=The Salt Lake Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the media coverage of the Washington Redskins, high schools with the name Redskins have received particular attention, including three which have a majority of Native American students. Advocates for the name conclude that because some Native Americans use the name to refer to themselves, it is not insulting.&lt;ref name=Spoken&gt;{{cite web|first=Rick |last=Reilly |title=Have the people spoken? |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9689220/redskins-name-change-not-easy-sounds/ |website=ESPN |accessdate=October 15, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919035546/http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9689220/redskins-name-change-not-easy-sounds |archivedate=September 19, 2013 |deadurl=no |date=September 18, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the principal of one of these, [[Red Mesa High School]] in [[Teec Nos Pos, Arizona]], said that use of the word outside American Indian communities should be avoided because it could perpetuate "the legacy of negativity that the term has created."&lt;ref name="Michelle Peirano"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cronkitenewsonline.com/2013/05/in-debate-over-redskins-name-is-the-r-word-for-racism-or-respect/|title=In debate over Redskins name, is the 'R-word' for racism or respect?|date=May 1, 2013|first=Michelle|last=Peirano|newspaper=Cronkite News|accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relationships with tribes to retain Native names have been established at the high school level. [[Arapahoe High School (Centennial, Colorado)]] now uses a logo provided by the [[Arapaho]] Tribe of Wyoming, which initially included an agreement that the image would not be placed on the gym floor or any article of clothing. The latter provision has not always been observed, but the logo does not appear on the team uniforms. The agreement also includes tribal participation in school events.

There was discussion about the "Indians" name at El Reno High School, [[El Reno, Oklahoma]] when a Native American student was not allowed to wear a beaded [[Square academic cap|mortarboard]] at graduation. The result was the signing of a Spirit Charter with the Cheyenne &amp; Arapaho Tribes to retain the name while agreeing to avoid any derogatory or disrespectful Native American references, including the wearing of Native American regalia by non-natives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.elrenops.org/| title=El Reno Public Schools| accessdate=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.koco.com/article/native-american-tribes-give-blessing-for-el-reno-high-schools-mascot/8777394| title=Native American tribes give blessing for El Reno High School’s mascot| date=February 13, 2017| author=Patrina Adger| publisher=KOCO-TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colleges and universities===
[[File:Ticket Washington vs Stanford 1930 side1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|1930 Football ticket stub depicting the former Stanford Indian mascot]]
Some college teams voluntarily changed their names and mascots. [[Stanford University]] had "The Stanford Indian" as its mascot from 1930 to 1972. Today Stanford's athletic team identity is build around the "[[Stanford Cardinal]]", reflecting the primary [[school colors|school color]] that have been used from the earliest days, while the unofficial mascot shown on it's primary logo is the [[Stanford Tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Color: Stanford Identity Toolkit|url=http://identity.stanford.edu/color.html|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early change was the "[[Saltine Warrior#Mascot|Saltine Warrior]]" that represented [[Syracuse University]] from 1931 until 1978. After a brief attempt to use a Roman warrior, the mascot became [[Otto the Orange]] for the school color. [[Miami University]] began discussion regarding the propriety of the Redskins name and images in 1972, and changed its team nickname to [[Miami RedHawks|RedHawks]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miami.muohio.edu/about-miami/diversity/miami-tribe-relations/mascot-story/index.html|title=Mascot Story|accessdate=February 5, 2013|publisher=Miami University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the team name of [[Eastern Michigan University]] changed from the [[Hurons]] to the Eagles in 1991, the change remained controversial as some students and alumni sought to restore it. In 2012, the university president brought back the Hurons logo, which was placed inside flap a of the band uniforms, along with another historic logo, with the stated intent of recognizing the past. However, the return of the Hurons logo has prompted protests from Native Americans at the university and in the local community, who state that the old mascot promotes stereotypes and hostility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/06/16/eastern-michigan-university-hurons-logo/28797179/| title=Native Americans rally against Hurons logo at EMU| first=Kim| last=Kozlowski| newspaper=The Detroit News| date=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/06/16/huron-logo-emu/28828217/| title=Community wants logo off EMU band uniforms| first=David| last=Jesse| newspaper=Detroit Free Press |date=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marquette University]] changed their team name from the Warriors to the Golden Eagles in 1994. The school's president stated:"We live in a different era than when the Warriors nickname was selected in 1954. The perspective of time has shown us that our actions, intended or not, can offend others. We must not knowingly act in a way that others will believe, based on their experience, to be an attack on their dignity as fellow human beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gomarquette.com/genrel/051105aaa.html|title=Trustees announce new nickname selection process|date=May 11, 2005|publisher=Marquette University|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1994, [[St. John's University (New York)]] changed the name of its athletic teams from the Redmen to the Red Storm after the university was pressured by American Indian groups who considered Redmen a slur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/09/nyregion/use-of-indians-as-mascots-to-be-subject-of-an-inquiry.html|title=Use of Indians As Mascots To Be Subject Of an Inquiry|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 9, 1998|accessdate=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2002, The Strategic Planning Committee of [[Stonehill College]] determined that the then-current mascot, the chieftain, was disrespectful to American Indians and decided that it would be changed. After discussion, the mascot was changed to the Skyhawk in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stonehillskyhawks.com/Why_A_Skyhawk|title=Why a Skyhawk?|accessdate=October 20, 2014|publisher=Stonehill College}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Jim Seavey, associate director of athletics stated: "Twelve years ago, the college discarded the logo that depicted the Indian with the headdress and feathers and stuff. We really did not have anything to represent our identity that we were comfortable with. We felt&amp;nbsp;... that it wasn't appropriate to have a physical representation of a Native American as our mascot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/02/27/digging_for_new_name_sends_stonehill_to_web/|title=Digging for new name sends Stonehill to Web|first=Emily|last=Sweeney|date=February 27, 2005|newspaper=The Boston Globe|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, teams that are not directly affected by this controversy have issued their opinions. The [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lssaa.wisc.edu/aisas/policy07.html |title=University Of Wisconsin Athletic Department Policy On Native American Logos And Names |accessdate=February 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221010322/http://www.lssaa.wisc.edu/aisas/policy07.html |archivedate=February 21, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Iowa]] have both refused to schedule non-conference games against schools with Native American mascots. The University of Iowa's own nickname, "Hawkeyes", has Native American origins (Iowa is the "[[Hawkeye State]]"), although the team uses a [[hawk]] as its symbol rather than an Indian.

Although [[Dartmouth University]] had not used an Indian mascot for many years, [[Yale University]] printed a program for the 2016 game commemorating its 100th game against Dartmouth showing historical program covers featuring depictions of Native Americans that are now viewed as racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2016/10/10/football-programs-criticized-for-racist-imagery/| title=Football programs criticized for racist imagery| first=Manasa| last=Rao| date=October 10, 2016| publisher=Yale Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====National Collegiate Athletic Association====
{{main article|NCAA Native American mascot decision}}
The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) distributed a "self evaluation" to 31 colleges in 2005, for teams to examine the use of potentially offensive imagery with their mascot choice. Subsequently, 19 teams were cited as having potentially "hostile or abusive" names, mascots, or images, that would be banned from displaying them during post-season play, and prohibited from hosting tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ncaa.org/static/champion/where-pride-meets-prejudice/index.php| title=Where Pride Meets Prejudice| first=Amy| last=Schwarb| publisher=National Collegiate Athletic Association| accessdate=December 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the colleges previously using Native American imagery changed except for those granted waivers when they obtained official support from individual tribes based upon the principle of [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|Tribal Sovereignty]].&lt;ref name="NCAI"/&gt;

[[San Diego State University]] (SDSU) was not cited by the NCAA in 2005 due to a decision that the Aztecs were not a Native American tribe with any living descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://legacy.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20050806/news_1s6mascots.html| title=NCAA puts limited ban on Indian mascots: Postseason policy doesn't hit Aztecs| first=Brent| last=Schrotenboer| date=August 6, 2005| publisher=San Diego Union-Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in February 2017 the SDSU Native American Student Alliance (NASA) supports removal of the mascot, calling its continue use "institutional racism" in its official statement to the Committee on Diversity, Equity and Outreach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thedailyaztec.com/81677/news/native-american-student-alliance-proposes-removal-of-aztec-mascot/| title=Native American Student Alliance proposes removal of Aztec mascot| author=Allyson Myers| date=February 27, 2017| publisher=The Daily Aztec}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwEYVqMcYGJOOF8xb0FxVFFwR0NqQldPN1BzbVR0aTRyZ1Fz/view| title=NASA 2016-2017 Mascot Statement| accessdate=February 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although that resolution was rejected by the SDSU Associated Students, the University Senate, which represents the administration, faculty, staff and students, has voted to phase out the human depiction of the Aztec Warrior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://timesofsandiego.com/sports/2017/11/08/no-more-aztec-warrior-sdsu-university-senate-votes-to-retire-mascot/| title=No More Aztec Warrior?

===Professional teams===

Few professional teams using Native names and imagery remain, several changing when they moved to other cities, while others went out of business. The [[Atlanta Hawks]] were originally the [[Quad Cities|Tri-Cities]] Blackhawks (using an "Indian" logo),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nba/tri/tricities.html |title=Tri-Cities Blackhawks (1946–1951) |accessdate=November 14, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120054903/http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nba/tri/tricities.html |archivedate=January 20, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Los Angeles Clippers|Clippers]] were originally the [[Buffalo Braves]]. The [[Golden State Warriors]] eliminated Native American imagery in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/uniforms_warriors.html|title=Going Retro: Golden State Warriors|publisher=NBA|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[United States national rugby league team]] was known as the Tomahawks until 2015, when [[USA Rugby League]] replaced the [[American National Rugby League]] as the sport's governing body in the U.S. and chose the simpler Hawks as the new name for the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.usarl.com/2015/05/hawks-swoop-in-for-new-usa-national-team-name/| title=Hawks swoop in for new USA National Team Name| accessdate=December 9, 2016| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529173837/http://www.usarl.com/2015/05/hawks-swoop-in-for-new-usa-national-team-name/| archivedate=May 29, 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mascot [[Chief Noc-A-Homa]] was replaced in 1986. The current mascot is "Homer the Brave".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/atl/fan_forum/homer_braves.jsp| title=Homer the Brave| accessdate=September 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chicago Blackhawks====
{{main|Chicago Blackhawks name and logo controversy}}
Native American rights advocate [[Suzan Shown Harjo]] ([[Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes|Cheyenne]] and Hodulgee [[Muscogee (Creek) Nation|Muscogee]]) says the Blackhawks have escaped the scrutiny given to other teams using Native imagery because [[hockey]] is not a cultural force on the level of [[American football|football]]. But she says national American Indian organizations have called for an end to all Indian-related mascots and that she found the hockey team's name and Indian head symbol to be offensive. "It lacks dignity," she said. "There's dignity in a school being named after a person or a people. There's dignity in a health clinic or hospital. There's nothing dignified in something being so named (that is used for) recreation or entertainment or fun." The National Congress of American Indians also opposes the Blackhawks' logo, as it does all Native American mascots.&lt;ref name=Keilman.2013&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-06-19/news/ct-met-indian-mascots-20130619_1_american-indians-black-hawk-mascots| title=Protests rare over Blackhawks' name, logo: While critics say use of Indian mascots perpetuates outdated image, hockey club says it has mutually beneficial ties with local community| date=June 19, 2013| first=John| last=Keilman| newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cleveland Indians====
{{main article|Cleveland Indians name and logo controversy}}
[[File:Vizquel96.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Former Cleveland Indians player [[Venezuelan people|Venezuelan]] [[Omar Vizquel]] wearing a baseball cap showing the image of the Cleveland Indians mascot, [[Chief Wahoo]]]]
Native Americans used the occasion of the 175th anniversary of the founding of Cleveland in 1971 to protest the history of native mistreatment by non-natives, from massacres to Chief Wahoo.&lt;ref name=oakley.1971&gt;{{cite news|last=Oakley|first=Don|title=Dilemmas Dog Indians|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2rhQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ltAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5731,2180138&amp;dq=chief+wahoo+protest&amp;hl=en|accessdate=June 7, 2013|newspaper=The Portsmouth Times|date=August 21, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests have continued on Opening Day of the baseball season each year since 1973.&lt;ref name=cnn.2012&gt;{{cite news|last=Siek|first=Stephanie|title=New baseball season brings fresh protests against Cleveland Indians mascot|url=http://inamerica.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/06/new-baseball-season-brings-fresh-protests-against-cleveland-indians-mascot/|accessdate=June 8, 2013|publisher=CNN|date=April 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief Wahoo is part of an exhibit at the [[Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia]] maintained by [[Ferris State University]] in Michigan. For Dr. David Pilgrim, a sociology professor at Ferris State and an expert in racial imagery, the symbol is a "red Sambo" that hardly differs from the caricatures of blacks popular in the Jim Crow era in which Wahoo was created, when such depictions of minority races were popularly used to inflame prejudice and justify discriminatory laws and behavior. Pilgrim explains how the exaggerated features serve their discriminatory purpose by emphasizing the differences of the depicted race, thereby reinforcing the idea that the caricaturized race is inferior.

The team's Vice President of Public Relations has defended the use of Chief Wahoo, saying that fans only associate Wahoo with baseball.&lt;ref name=Pattakos.2012&gt;{{cite news|last=Pattakos|first=Peter|title=The Curse of Chief Wahoo: Are we paying the price for embracing America's last acceptable racist symbol?|url=http://www.clevescene.com/gyrobase/the-curse-of-chief-wahoo/Content?oid=2954423&amp;showFullText=true|accessdate=May 17, 2013|newspaper=The Cleveland Scene|date=April 25, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120062629/http://www.clevescene.com/gyrobase/the-curse-of-chief-wahoo/Content?oid=2954423&amp;showFullText=true|archivedate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the team in the 2016 season led to renewed attention,&lt;ref name="Jerry Howarth"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Peter|title=Jerry Howarth refuses to say Cleveland team name|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/baseball/2016/10/11/jerry-howarth-refuses-to-say-cleveland-team-name.html|website=Toronto Star|date=October 11, 2016|accessdate=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/architect-douglas-cardinal-files-human-rights-complaint-against-use-of-cleveland-s-name-logo-1.3806662| title=Architect Douglas Cardinal files human rights complaint against use of Cleveland's name, logo: Major League Baseball 'does not give baseball teams license for such wanton discrimination,' lawyer says| publisher=CBC News| date=October 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.nationalpost.com/sports/mlb/activist-in-court-today-to-bar-cleveland-indians-from-using-name-and-chief-wahoo-logo-in-ontario| title=Cleveland Indians can use name and 'Chief Wahoo' logo during ALCS games in Toronto, judge rules| first=Joseph| last=Brean| date=October 17, 2016| publisher=National Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/cleveland-indians-native-americans-rally-logo-161025193242211.html| title=Cleveland Indians: Native Americans rally against logo| date=October 25, 2016| publisher= Aljaxeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; with pressure from current MLB Commissioner [[Rob Manfred]] that there should be progress towards elimination of the logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/sports/commissioner-starts-to-press-cleveland-indians-about-logo.html| title=Commissioner Starts to Press Cleveland Indians About Logo| author=David Waldstein | date=April 12, 2017| newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Edmonton Eskimos====
{{further|Edmonton Eskimos#Origins of the name}}
In part because they do not use any native imagery, the Eskimos are rarely mentioned with regard to the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/washington-redskins-fight-could-put-pressure-on-edmonton-eskimos-1.2680161|title=Washington Redskins fight could put pressure on Edmonton Inuit|first=Matt|last=Kwong|publisher=CBC|date=June 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However [[Natan Obed]], the President of [[Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami]], Canada's national Inuit organization, has stated that "''Eskimo'' is not only outdated, it is now largely considered a derogatory term" and is a "relic of colonial power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/attention-edmonton-eskimos-inuit-are-not-mascots/article27512855/|title=Attention Edmonton Eskimos: Inuit are not mascots| first=Natan| last=Obed| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| date=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Kansas City Chiefs====

In 1963 the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] adopted a name referring to Native Americans, when the Dallas Texans (AFL) relocated. The team was named in honor of Kansas City mayor [[Harold Roe Bartle]] who was instrumental in bringing the Texans to [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. Bartel earned his nickname as founder of a [[Boy Scouts]] honor camping society [[Tribe of Mic-O-Say]] in which he was "Chief" Lone Bear. In 1989 the Chiefs switched from [[Warpaint (mascot)|Warpaint]], a [[Pinto horse]] ridden by a man in a feathered headdress, to their current mascot [[K. C. Wolf]]. Warpaint returned in 2009, but is ridden by a [[Cheerleading|cheerleader]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcchiefs.com/cheerleaders/warpaint.html|title=Warpaint|publisher=Kansas City Chiefs|accessdate=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the appearance of photographs of fans attending an October 2013 game wearing feathers and warpaint—and doing the tomahawk chop—in the ''[[Kansas City Star]]'', numerous Native Americans submitted complaints to the publication. One caller, who was especially upset that the photographs were published on [[Columbus Day]], described the images as a "mockery" and "racist". Writing for the ''Star'''s "Public Editor" column, Derek Donovan explained that he found the complaints "reasonable" and suggested that the newspaper depict "other colorful, interesting people in the crowds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/2013/10/27/4577055/fans-indian-dress-is-problematic.html|title=Chiefs fans' 'Indian' dress is problematic|date=October 27, 2013|first=DEREK|last=DONOVAN|newspaper=The Kansas City Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Kansas City Star'' reported in early August 2014 that the team's management is planning discussions with some Native American groups to find a non-confrontational way to eliminate, or at least reduce, offensive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/sam-mellinger/article1161612.html|title= To avoid a cultural free-for-all, Chiefs form alliance with American Indian groups|first=SAM|last=MELLINGER|newspaper=The Kansas City Star|date=August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amanda Blackhorse, the lead plaintiff in the trademark case against the Washington Redskins, thinks the real solution is a name change for the Chiefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/sam-mellinger/article618354.html|title= Woman behind fight against Washington's NFL nickname says Chiefs should be on guard|first=SAM|last=MELLINGER|newspaper=The Kansas City Star|date=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native Americans in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] picketed at the game between the Chiefs and the [[Arizona Cardinals]], and have asked the Cardinals' management to bar "[[Redface]]", the wearing of headdresses and face paint, protesting what they perceive to be a mockery of Native American culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/valleyfever/2014/12/native_americans_calling_on_arizona_cardinals_to_make_policy_against_headdr.php| title=Native Americans Calling on Arizona Cardinals to Make Policy Against Headdresses, Redface| first=Matthew| last=Hendley| date=December 10, 2014| publisher=Phoenix New Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; A protest took place in Minnesota when the Chiefs played the Vikings on October 18, 2015. "The Kansas City Chiefs have flown under the radar," said Norma Renville, the executive director of Women of Nations Community Advocacy Program and Shelter. "They are contributing to our cultural genocide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.grandforksherald.com/news/politics/3862967-native-american-groups-protest-kansas-city-chiefs-nickname-vikings-game| title= Native American groups to protest Kansas City Chiefs nickname at Vikings game| first=Barry| last=Lytton| date=October 16, 2015| publisher=The Grand Forks Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achieving greater visibility by reaching the playoffs in 2016, Native Americans at [[Haskell Indian Nations University]] in [[Lawrence, Kansas]] are asking the Chiefs to stop behavior that invokes stereotypes, such as wearing headdresses and doing the "tomahawk chop".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.kshb.com/sports/football/chiefs/kansas-indigenous-group-asking-kansas-city-chiefs-fans-to-stop-the-tomahawk-chop| title=Kansas indigenous group asking Kansas City Chiefs fans to stop the Tomahawk chop| first=Ariel| last=Rothfield| date=January 15, 2016| publisher=KSHB Kansas City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other issues==

===Stereotyping by rival fans===
In addition to the behavior of the teams that have Native American names or mascots, their rivals often invoke racist stereotypes.

In December 2013 when the Washington Redskins played the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] an employee of a [[Sonic Drive-In]] in Missouri placed a message outside that used [[scalping]], [[Indian reservation|reservations]] and [[Whisky|whiskey]] to disparage the "Redskins". It was quickly removed with the owner's apologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2520773/Sonic-Drive-restaurant-upsets-racist-sign-scalp-Washington-Redskins.html|title=Fast food restaurant upsets customers with racist sign promising that the Kansas City Chiefs would 'scalp' the Washington Redskins|publisher=Daily Mail|first=Sara|last=Malm|date=9 December 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rubber severed "Indian" head impaled on a knife has been used by a sports fan in [[Philadelphia]] to taunt rival teams with Native American mascots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nativeappropriations.com/2010/06/thanks-for-the-severed-head-youve-proved-my-point.html|title=Thanks for the severed head. You proved my point|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been a number of incidents of rival high school teams displaying banners or signs referencing the ''[[Trail of Tears]]'', which have been criticized for both insensitivity and ignorance of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/Blog/2013/11/19/McAdory-High-School-in-Alabama-apologizes-for-Trail-of-Tears-sign/5471384871891/|title=McAdory High School in Alabama apologizes for 'Trail of Tears' sign|first=Evan|last=Bleier|date=November 19, 2013|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/11/heres-another-high-school-football-team-promoting-trail-tears|title=Here's Another High School Football Team Promoting the "Trail of Tears"|first=Tim|last=Murphy|date=November 21, 2013|publisher=Mother Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/osu-football-trail-of-tears-college-gameday-sign-condemned-by-university/article/5337476?custom_click=rss|title=OSU football: 'Trail of Tears' College GameDay sign condemned by university|first=Erik|last=Horne|date=August 30, 2014|publisher=NewsOK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://deadspin.com/cheerleaders-display-trail-of-tears-banner-before-gam-1788354107| title=Cheerleaders Display "Trail Of Tears" Banner Before Game Against Team With Indian Mascot| first=Timothy| last=Burk| date=October 29, 2016| publisher=Deadspin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Central Michigan Chippewas]] have the support of the [[Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Nation]] of [[Michigan]], a student at rival [[Western Michigan University]] designed a T-shirt showing a Native American behind bars with the legend "Caught a Chippewa about a week ago". It was quickly condemned by both university presidents, who agreed that anyone wearing the shirt at a game would be ejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.wwmt.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/WMU-CMU-presidents-offer-swift-action-following-t-shirt-controversy-59232.shtml#.VHacPtab2Q4| title=WMU, CMU presidents offer swift action following t-shirt controversy| date=November 22, 2014| publisher=WWMT-TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the [[University of North Dakota]] changing their mascot from the Fighting Sioux to the [[North Dakota Fighting Hawks|Fighting Hawks]], students at rival [[North Dakota State University]] (NDSU) continue to chant "Sioux suck shit" whenever their football team makes a first down. The NDSU president, along with the presidents of the student body and faculty senates, have called for an end to the practice, which they describe as hateful, and coming from a misplaced sense of tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.grandforksherald.com/news/4138709-ndsu-president-calls-end-hateful-sioux-chant-bison-football-games#.WAWqJt0tDBY.facebook| title=NDSU president calls for end of 'hateful' Sioux chant at Bison football games| author=Patrick Springer | date=October 17, 2016| publisher=Grand Forks Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some NDSU fans also wear T-shirts with graphics depicting variations on the "Sioux suck" theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/11/19/offensive-t-shirt-shows-ndsu-fans-cant-let-go-sioux-suck-chant-lives-166519| title=Offensive T-Shirt Shows NDSU Fans Can’t Let Go: ‘Sioux Suck’ Chant Lives On| author=Konnie LeMay| date=November 19, 2016| publisher=Indian Country TodayN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Varying degrees of offensiveness===
To further complicate this controversy, many feel that there are varying levels of offensiveness with team names and mascots. The nature and degree of stereotyping varies depending upon the name of the team, the logo, the mascot, and the behavior of fans. The greatest offense is taken when the logo and mascot are caricatures viewed as insulting, such as the [[Cleveland Indians]]' [[Chief Wahoo]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=5437|title=Coalition Of Religious Investors Fight Baseball Team Logo|date=July 10, 1997|accessdate=January 18, 2013|publisher=Catholic Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; the name of the team is often regarded as a racial slur, such as [[redskin (slang)|Redskins]] or [[Squaw]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dodgecountynews.com/archives/7311-Squaws-are-region-runner-upshost-first-round-of-state-Friday.html| title=Squaws are region runner-ups:host first round of state Friday| date=February 15, 2017 | accessdate=March 6, 2017| publisher=The Dodge County News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the behavior of the mascot or fans is based upon popular images of Indians which trivialize authentic native cultures; such as the tomahawk chop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2013/5/1/4292152/yeah-the-tomahawk-chop-bugs-me-heres-why| title=Yeah, the "Tomahawk Chop" bugs me. Here's why| first=Mike| last=Bates| date=May 1, 2013| publisher=SBNation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practices of individual schools and teams have changed in response to the controversy. A local example is [[Washington High School (Sioux Falls, South Dakota)|Washington High School]] in [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]]. Many Native American images have been removed, and the "Warriors" nickname is now claimed to be generic. The school now has a "circle of courage" logo with eagle feathers and has also "updated" the murals of Chief [[Hollow Horn Bear]] in the gym. Duane Hollow Horn Bear, the chief's great-grandson, who teaches Lakota language and history at [[Sinte Gleska University]] in Mission, stated: "We had no objection to their utilizing those pictures as long as my great-grandfather was represented with honor and dignity." However, not all Native Americans are happy with the presence of any such images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.argusleader.com/story/opinion/columnists/stu-whitney/2015/01/17/whitney-sioux-falls-team-indian-nickname/21925163/| title=Does Washington High have nickname problem?| first=Stu| last=Whitney| date=January 17, 2015| publisher=Argus Leader}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teams outside the Americas===
{{further|List of sports team names and mascots derived from indigenous peoples}}
Native American names and images are used by teams in other countries, generally those playing American-style sports and copying the imagery of American teams. Several are in Austria, Germany, and Sweden, which also have a tradition of [[Native American hobbyism in Germany|Native American hobbyists]].
