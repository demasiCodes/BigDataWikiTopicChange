[[File:NotYourMascot2.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Protest of Washington NFL team in Minneapolis, Nov. 2014]]
&lt;!-- NOTE: This lead section is a summary of the sections below, so references are minimal 
(See WP:Manual_of_Style/Lead_section)--&gt;
The propriety of using names and images referring to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] as [[mascot]]s in sports has been a topic of public controversy in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] since the 1960s, as part of the movement for [[Native American civil rights]]. There have been protests and other actions targeting the more visible professional teams, such as the [[Cleveland Indians]] (in particular their "[[Chief Wahoo]]" logo), and the [[Washington Redskins]], due to the name "Redskins" being defined in most American English dictionaries as derogatory slang.&lt;ref name="Davis.2010"&gt;{{cite book| url=http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Native_American_Mascot_Controversy.html?id=GApQrXWeGLwC| editor=C.

The issue is often discussed in the media in terms of offensiveness, which reduces it to feelings and opinions, and prevents full understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images and why their use by sports teams should be eliminated.&lt;ref name="King.2010"&gt;{{cite book| url=http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Native_American_Mascot_Controversy.html?id=GApQrXWeGLwC| editor=C.

Richard King| publisher=Scarecrow Press| location=Lanham, Maryland| year=2010| isbn=978-0-8108-6731-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Social science research says that sports mascots and images, rather than being mere entertainment, are important symbols with deeper psychological and social effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stephanie A.

Native mascots are also part of the larger issues of [[cultural appropriation]] and the violation of [[indigenous intellectual property]] rights, which includes all instances where non-natives use indigenous music, art, costumes, etc. in entertainment or other performances. It has been argued that harm to Native Americans occurs because the appropriation of Native culture by the majority society continues the systems of dominance and subordination that have been used to colonize, assimilate, and oppress indigenous groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Riley| first=Angela| title=Straight Stealing: Towards an Indigenous System of Cultural Property Protection| journal=Washington Law Review| volume=80| issue=69| date=2005| url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=703283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defenders of the current usage often state their intention to honor Native Americans by referring to positive traits, such as fighting spirit and being aggressive, brave, stoic, dedicated, and proud; while opponents see these traits as being based upon stereotypes of Native Americans as savages.&lt;ref name="Davis.2010"/&gt; Supporters also state that the issue is not important, being only about sports, and that the opposition is nothing more than "[[political correctness]]", which  critics argue ignores the extensive evidence of harmful effects of stereotypes and bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Native_American_Mascot_Controversy.html?id=GApQrXWeGLwC|editor=C.

Munson|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Maryland|year=2010|isbn=978-0-8108-6731-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Opinion poll|Surveys of public opinion]] consistently find that the majority of people in the United States support retaining the names and images in current use, however there has been a steady decline in the number of teams doing so. Native American images and nicknames nevertheless remain fairly common in American sports, and may be seen in use by teams at all levels from elementary school to professional.

==History==
[[European American]]s have had a history of drawing inspiration from native peoples and "playing Indian" that dates back at least to the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Calloway"&gt;[[Colin G. Calloway|Calloway, Colin G.]] (2004) ''First Peoples'', 2nd Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; This practice led directly to the origins of many nicknames and mascots. Like the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) (in particular, the [[Order of the Arrow]]) and many summer camps, university students in the late 19th and early 20th centuries adopted Indian names and symbols for their group identities, not from authentic sources but rather as Native American life was imagined by European Americans.&lt;ref name="Spindel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spindel|first=Carol|year=2002|title=Dancing at Halftime: Sports and the Controversy Over American Indian Mascots|location=New York|publisher=New York University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional team nicknames had similar origins. Founded as the Boston Red Stockings, the team became the [[History of the Boston Braves|Braves]] for the first time in 1912. Their owner, [[James E. Gaffney|James Gaffney]], was a member of New York City's political machine, [[Tammany Hall]], one of the societies originally formed to honor [[Tamanend]], a chief of the [[Lenape|Delaware]]. The success of the Braves in the [[1914 World Series]] may have been the reason for the Cleveland team, which was looking for a new nickname, to become the [[Cleveland Indians|Indians]] in 1915. The story that the team is named to honor [[Louis Sockalexis]], the first Native American to play [[Major League Baseball]], cannot be verified from historical documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An Act of Honor or Exploitation? The Cleveland Indians' Use of the Louis Francis Sockalexis Story|first=Ellen|last=Staurowsky|journal=Sociology of Sports Journal|date=December 1998|volume=15 | issue = 4|page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] were originally also known as the Boston Braves when formed in 1932, since it was the custom at the time to have the same team names when baseball and [[American football|football]] teams shared the same stadium. After moving to the [[Fenway Park|home]] of the [[Boston Red Sox]], the team name was changed to Redskins in 1933, before moving again to Washington, D.C. in 1937. Thus, the use of Native American names and imagery by this team began before the hiring of [[William Henry Dietz]] as coach in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/wasbos/bosskins.html|title=The Boston Redskins|accessdate=2013-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stereotyping of Native Americans must be understood in the context of history which includes conquest, forced relocation, and organized efforts to eradicate native cultures, such as the [[Native American boarding schools|boarding schools]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which separated young Native Americans from their families in order to educate them as European Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/policy/mascots-justif.pdf|title=APA Resolution Justifications|year=2005|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated in an editorial by Carter Meland ([[Anishinaabe]] heritage) and David E. Wilkins ([[Lumbee]]) both professors of [[Native American studies|American Indian Studies]] at the [[University of Minnesota]]: "Since the first Europeans made landfall in North America, native peoples have suffered under a weltering array of stereotypes, misconceptions and caricatures. Whether portrayed as ''[[noble savage]]s'', ''[[Stereotypes about indigenous peoples of North America|ignoble savages]]'', ''teary-eyed [[Environmentalism|environmentalists]]'' or, most recently, simply as ''casino-rich'', native peoples find their efforts to be treated with a measure of respect and integrity undermined by images that flatten complex tribal, historical and personal experience into one-dimensional representations that tells us more about the depicters than about the depicted." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Star Tribune|title=Stereotypes in sports, chaos in federal policy|author=Carter Meland and David E.

==Perspectives==

===Native Americans===
In the 1940s the [[National Congress of American Indians]] (NCAI) created a campaign to eliminate negative stereotyping of Native American people in the media. Over time, the campaign began to focus on Indian names and mascots in sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hylton|first=J Gordon|title=BEFORE THE REDSKINS WERE THE REDSKINS: THE USE OF NATIVE AMERICAN TEAM NAMES IN THE FORMATIVE ERA OF AMERICAN SPORTS, 1857-1933|publisher=North Dakota law review|date=2010-01-01|volume=86|page=879}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCAI maintains that teams with mascots such as the [[Braves]] and the [[Redskins]] perpetuate negative stereotypes of Native American people, and demean their native traditions and rituals: "Often citing a long held myth by non-Native people that "Indian" mascots "honor Native people," American sports businesses such as the [[National Football League|NFL]]’s [[Washington Redskins|Washington 'Redsk*ns']] and [[Kansas City Chiefs|Kansas City 'Chiefs']], [[Major League Baseball|MLB]]’s [[Cleveland Indians|Cleveland 'Indians']] and [[Atlanta Braves|Atlanta 'Braves']], and the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]’s [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]], continue to profit from harmful stereotypes originated during a time when white superiority and segregation were common place."&lt;ref name="NCAI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncai.org/policy-issues/community-and-culture/anti-defamation-mascots|title=Anti-Defamation and Mascots|publisher=National Congress of American Indians|accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On these stereotypes, the NCAI states these mascots, "slander, defame, and vilify Native peoples, Native cultures, and tribal nations, and continue a legacy of racist and prejudiced attitudes. In particular, the ‘savage’ and ‘clownish’ caricatures used by sports teams with "Indian" mascots contribute to the "savage" image of Native peoples and the myth that Native peoples are an ethnic group ‘frozen in history.’ All of which continue to plague this country’s relationships with Native peoples and perpetuate racial and political inequity."&lt;ref name="NCAI.2013"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ncai.org/resources/ncai_publications/ending-the-legacy-of-racism-in-sports-the-era-of-harmful-indian-sports-mascots| title=Ending the Legacy of Racism in Sports &amp; the Era of Harmful Indian Sports Mascots| accessdate=September 23, 2015| publisher=NCAI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the founders of the [[American Indian Movement]], including [[Clyde Bellecourt]], [[Vernon Bellecourt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | issn = 0362-4331 | last = Martin | first = Douglas| title = Vernon Bellecourt, Who Protested the Use of Indian Mascots, Dies at 75| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2014-11-12| date = 2007-10-17 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/17/sports/17bellecourt.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Russel Means]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Russell Means: A Look at His Journey Through Life| work = Indian Country Today Media Network.com | format = Text | accessdate = 2014-11-12 | date = 2012-10-22| url = http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2012/10/22/russell-means-look-his-journey-through-life-141444}}&lt;/ref&gt; were also the first to protest names and mascots such as the Washington Redskins and [[Chief Wahoo]].

Cornel Pewewardy, Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at [[Portland State University]], cites indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism which, by placing images of Native American or First Nations people into an invented media context, continues to maintain the superiority of the dominant culture.&lt;ref name="Pewewardy.1999"&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 07101481| volume = 23| issue = 2| pages = 176–189| last = Pewewardy| first = Cornel| title = From enemy to mascot: The deculturation of Indian mascots in sports culture| journal = Canadian Journal of Native Education| accessdate = 2014-11-22| date = 1999| url = http://search.proquest.com.mutex.gmu.edu/docview/230304174?accountid=14541}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such practices can be seen as a form of [[cultural imperialism]] or [[neocolonialism]].&lt;ref name="Longwell-Grice.2003"&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 00276014| volume = 40| issue = 3| pages = 1–12| last = Longwell-Grice| first = Robert| coauthors = Hope Longwell-Grice| title = Chiefs, Braves, and Tomahawks: The Use of American Indians as University Mascots| journal = NASPA Journal (National Association of Student Personnel Administrators, Inc.)| accessdate = 2014-10-29| year = 2003 | url = http://mutex.gmu.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ehh&amp;AN=32547562&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all Native Americans are united in total opposition to mascots. Steven Denson, director of diversity for [[Southern Methodist University]] and member of the [[Chickasaw]] nation, while not issuing a blanket endorsement, has nevertheless stated that there are acceptable ways to use Native American mascots if it is done in a respectful and tasteful manner. He states: "I believe it is acceptable if used in a way that fosters understanding and increased positive awareness of the Native-American culture. And it must also be done with the support of the Native-American community. There is a way to achieve a partnership that works together to achieve mutually beneficial goals."&lt;ref name="SMU"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/153383/nativeamerican_nicknamesmascots/index.html| title=Native-American Nicknames/Mascots|publisher=Red Orbit| date=June 2, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five of the college teams originally list by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] as possibly "hostile and abusive" ([[#National Collegiate Athletic Association|see below]]) established relationships with specific tribes that allowed them to retain their names.

===Social sciences and education===

The harm done by the use of Native American mascots, particularly in an academic context, was stated by the Society of Indian Psychologists in 1999:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Stereotypical and historically inaccurate images of Indians in general interfere with learning about them by creating, supporting and maintaining oversimplified and inaccurate views of indigenous peoples and their cultures. When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information, they contribute to the development of cultural biases and prejudices, (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the University.) In the same vein, we believe that continuation of the use of Indians as symbols and mascots is incongruous with the philosophy espoused by many Americans as promoting inclusivity and diversity.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aiansip.org/uploads/SIP_Indian_Mascot_Position_Statement.pdf|title=Society of Indian Psychologists|date=January 27, 1999|accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sports mascots have been cited as an example of [[Microaggression theory|microaggressions]], the everyday insults that members of marginalized minority groups are subject to in the comments and actions of other groups in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Microaggressions and Marginality: Manifestation, Dynamics, and Impact| author=Derald Wing Sue| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons| date=2010| pages=384| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WZxpPnnjzkC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=sports+mascot+microaggression&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YeoTsr0Vy-&amp;sig=nl35tZtC0zkDMsBstdFa5ut4YiY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAmoVChMIrq2r2pqJxwIVAvMeCh2STAyE#v=onepage&amp;q=sports%20mascot%20microaggression&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[American Psychological Association]] issued a resolution "Recommending the Immediate Retirement of American Indian Mascots, Symbols, Images, and Personalities by Schools, Colleges, Universities, Athletic Teams, and Organizations" due to the harm done by creating a hostile environment, the negative impact on the self-esteem of American Indian children, and discrimination that may violate civil rights. It also impacts non-natives by reinforcing mainstream stereotypes, preventing learning about Native American culture. The APA states that stereotyping is disrespectful of the beliefs, traditions and values of Native Americans.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/indian-mascots.aspx|title=Summary of the Resolution Recommending Retirement of American Indian Mascots|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar resolutions have been adopted by the [[American Sociological Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/about/Council_Statements/use_of_native_american_nicknames_logos_and_mascots.cfm|title=Statement by the Council of the American Sociological Association on Discontinuing the Use of Native American Nicknames, Logos and Mascots in Sport|publisher=American Sociological Association|date=March 6, 2007|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Counseling Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counseling.org/docs/resolutions/resolutions-2001-present.pdf?sfvrsn=2|publisher=American Counseling Association|title=Opposition to Use of Stereotypical Native American Images as Sports Symbols and Mascots|year=2001|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American Anthropological Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.aaanet.org/issues/press/upload/Sports-Mascot-Resolution-Release-Final.pdf| title=AAA Calls on Sports Organizations to Denounce Inappropriate American Indian Mascots| date=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 report on the status of Native American students, the [[National Education Association]] included the elimination of Indian mascots and sports team names as one of its recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A Report on the Status of American Indians and Alaska Natives in Education|first=|author=Trujillo,Octaviana (Ph.D.)|author2=Alston, Denise (Ph.D.)|year=2005|publisher=National Education Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social science research gives weight to the perceptions of those directly affected. In particular, studies support the view that sports mascots and images are not trivial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fryberg |first=Stephanie A.|title=Of Warrior Chiefs and Indian Princesses: The Psychological Consequences of American Indian Mascots|work=Basic and applied social psychology|date=September 2008|volume=30 | issue = 3|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotyping directly affects academic performance and self-esteem, which contribute to all of the other issues faced by Native Americans, including suicide, unemployment, and poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/opinion/sunday/intelligence-and-the-stereotype-threat.html|title=It’s Not Me, It’s You|first=ANNIE|last=MURPHY PAUL|date=October 6, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2013-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; European Americans exposed to mascots are more likely to believe not only that stereotypes are true, but that Native Americans have no identity beyond these stereotypes.&lt;ref name="bias"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chaney|first=John| title=Do American Indian Mascots = American Indian People? Examining Implicit Bias towards American Indian People and American Indian Mascots|work=American Indian and Alaska native mental health research |date=2011-01-01|volume=18 | issue = 1|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research also demonstrates the harm done to society by stereotyping of any kind. Two studies examined the effect of exposure to an American Indian sports mascot on the tendency to endorse stereotypes of a different minority group. A study was first done at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], and then replicated at [[The College of New Jersey]] with the same results. Students were given a paragraph to read about [[Chief Illiniwek]] adapted from the University of Illinois' official website; while the control group was given a description of an arts center. In both studies the students exposed to the sports mascot were more likely to express stereotypical views of [[Asian American]]s. Although Chief Illiniwek was described only in terms of positive characteristics (as a respectful symbol, not a mascot), the stereotyping of Asian Americans included negative characteristics, such as being "socially inept". This was indicative of a spreading effect; exposure to any stereotypes increased the likelihood of stereotypical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim-Prieto|first=Chu|title=Effect of Exposure to an American Indian Mascot on the Tendency to Stereotype a Different Minority Group|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|date=March 2010|volume=40|number=3|page=534|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2010.00586.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-hidden-brain/201003/native-american-imagery-sports-mascots-new-problem|work=Psychology Today|title=Native American imagery as sports mascots: A new problem|date=March 25, 2010|first=Shankar|last=Vedantam|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summarizing such studies, writer DaShanne Stokes states that mascots perpetuate "institutionalized racism. Institutionalized racism contributes to high rates of unemployment, poverty, health problems, and inadequate education for many Native Americans. In short, Native team names and mascots contribute to the very problems we should be focused on solving.{{cite news| url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/04/21/5-studies-prove-dan-snyder-wrong-about-redskins| title=5 Studies That Prove Dan Snyder is Wrong About 'Redskins'| author=DaShanne Stokes| date=April 21, 2014| publisher=Indian Country Today}}

===Civil rights===

The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] passed a resolution calling for the end of the use of Native American names, images, and mascots in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aistm.org/naacp_1999_resolution.htm|title=NAACP 1999 Resolution|accessdate=2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights|U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] released an advisory opinion calling ''for an end to the use of Native American images and team names by non-Native schools.'' The opinion made the following points:
* The use of Native American images and nicknames in school is insensitive and should be avoided, and may violate anti-discrimination laws. 
*These references.. are particularly inappropriate and insensitive in light of the long history of forced assimilation that American Indian people have endured in this country.
*It is particularly disturbing that Native American references are still to be found in educational institutions ... where diverse groups of people come together to learn not only the "Three Rs," but also how to interact respectfully with people from different cultures.
*The use of stereotypical images may create a hostile  environment that may be intimidating to Indian students. American Indians have the lowest high school graduation rates in the nation and even lower college attendance and graduation rates. The perpetuation of harmful stereotypes may exacerbate these problems. 
*Schools that continue [these practices] claim that their use stimulates interest in Native American culture and honors Native Americans but have simply failed to listen to the Native groups, religious leaders, and civil rights organizations that oppose this behavior.
*Mascots, symbols and team names are not accurate representations of Native Americans. Even those that purport to be positive are romantic stereotypes that give a distorted view of the past. These false portrayals prevent non-Native Americans from understanding the true historical and cultural experiences of American Indians. Sadly, they also encourage biases and prejudices that have a negative effect on contemporary Indian people. These references may encourage interest in mythical "Indians" created by the dominant culture, but they block genuine understanding of contemporary Native people as fellow Americans.''&lt;ref name="usccr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aistm.org/fr.usccr.htm |title=Statement of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights on the Use of Native American Images and Nicknames as Sports Symbols |publisher=The United States Commission on Civil Rights |date=April 13, 2001 |accessdate=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, the [[Michigan Department of Civil Rights]] (MDCR) filed a complaint with the [[United States Department of Education|US Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]] (OCR). MDCR's complaint asserts that new research clearly establishes that use of American Indian imagery negatively impacts student learning, creating an unequal learning environment in violation of Article VI of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].&lt;ref name=MDCR&gt;{{cite web|title=Michigan Department of Civil Rights: Continued Use of American Indian Mascots Hurts Student Achievement|url=http://www.michigan.gov/mdcr/0,4613,7-138--294605--,00.html|publisher=State of Michigan|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, the OCR dismissed the case on the basis that the legal standard required not only harm, but the intent to do harm, which was not established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20130603/NEWS06/306030121/indian-mascot-ban-tossed-michigan|title=Feds toss Michigan complaint to ban Indian mascots for sports teams|date=June 3, 2013|newspaper=The Detroit Free Press|author=Lori Higgins|accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the schools named in the MDCR complaint, [[Saranac, Michigan|Saranac Community Schools]] in [[Ionia County]], MI plans to retain the name Redskins but has replaced the logo on its uniforms with a "[[Dreamcatcher]]" and the band will no longer play the "Tomahawk Song" at games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://woodtv.com/2014/09/18/saranac-schools-make-changes-to-mascot/|title=Saranac Schools Make Changes to Mascot|publisher=WoodTV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil rights law in the United States reflect the difference between the experience of racism by [[African American]]s and Native Americans. Slavery was a more personal assault and continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process. The difference is reflected in the continued popularity of Native Americans as mascots when similar usage of the names and images of any other ethnic group, in particular [[African American]]s, would be unthinkable, and the continued claim that the stereotype of the "noble savage" honors Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=56|journal=UCLA Law Review|page=591|title=Red: Racism and the American Indian|last=Berger|first=Bethany R.|year=2009|url=http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-3-2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a report issued in 2012, a [[United Nations]] expert on Human Rights of Indigenous Peoples cited the continued use of Native American references by sports team as a part of the stereotyping that "obscures understanding of the reality of Native Americans today and instead help to keep alive racially discriminatory attitudes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14497&amp;LangID=E|title=USA: ‘Redskins’ Team mascot hurtful reminder of past suffering of Native Americans – UN rights expert|publisher=United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious organizations===

In 1992, the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] issued a resolution calling for the end of sports teams names that promote racism, in particular the Atlanta Braves and the Washington Redskins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccarnet.org/rabbis-speak/resolutions/1992/racism-1992/|title=Resolution Adopted by the CCAR: Racism|year=1992|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the [[United Methodist Church]] also passed a resolution condemning the use of Native American team names and sports mascots, which was highlighted in a meeting of the Black caucus of that organization in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=5765541&amp;ct=3722449|title=Black caucus joins Native American mascot fight|date=April 4, 2007|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umc-gbcs.org/faith-in-action/native-american-mascots-must-go|title= Native American mascots must go: Time to remove them is long passed|author=Rev.

A group of sixty-one religious leaders in Washington, D.C. sent a letter to NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] and team owner [[Daniel Snyder]] stating their moral obligation to join the Change the Mascot movement due to the offensive and inappropriate nature of the name which causes pain whether or not that is intended.&lt;ref name="faith"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/local/letter-to-goodell-and-snyder/695/|title=Letter to Goodell and Snyder|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/faith-leaders-urge-redskins-owner-dan-snyder-and-nfl-to-change-teams-name/2013/12/05/e1dad2be-5dd3-11e3-be07-006c776266ed_story.html|title=Faith leaders urge Redskins owner Dan Snyder and NFL to change team’s name|author=Theresa Vargas|date=December 5, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the Indian Affairs Committee of the Baltimore Yearly Meeting of the [[Quakers|Society of Friends]] approved a formal statement condemning the name of the Washington football team, stating that "the NFL has violated its core principles for decades by allowing the team playing in Washington, D.C., to carry the name 'redskins,' a racist epithet that insults millions of Native Americans. Continued use of the term encourages and perpetuates persecution, disrespect, and bigotry against Native men, women, and children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/29/quaker-indian-affairs-call-redskins-change-name-156099|title=Quaker Indian Affairs Call for Redskins to Change Name|date=July 29, 2014|publisher=Indian Country Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Torch Committee, the student government organization of the [[Sandy Spring Friends School]] in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, voted to ban any apparel on the campus which includes the Redskins name, although the logo would continue to be allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/md-private-school-bans-use-of-the-r-word-on-campus-to-promote-equality/2015/02/13/bdbf769c-b394-11e4-854b-a38d13486ba1_story.html| title=Md. private school bans use of the ‘R-word’ on campus to promote equality| author1=Moriah Balingit| author2=John Woodrow Cox| date=February 13, 2015| newspaper=The Washington Post}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In a meeting March 1, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Central Atlantic Conference of the [[United Church of Christ]] (UCC) unanimously passed a resolution proposing that its members boycott Washington Redskins games and shun products bearing the team’s logo until the team changes its name and mascot. Team spokesman [[Tony Wyllie]] offered a response, saying, "We respect those who disagree with our team’s name, but we wish the United Church of Christ would listen to the voice of the overwhelming majority of Americans, including Native Americans, who support our name and understand it honors the heritage and tradition of the Native American community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/churches-propose-a-boycott-of-redskins-unless-the-team-change-its-name/2014/03/01/488669bc-a189-11e3-b8d8-94577ff66b28_story.html|title=Churches propose a boycott of Redskins unless the team changes its name|author=Carol Morello|date=March 1, 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its annual meeting in June 2014, the membership of the UCC also passed a resolution supporting the boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nativenewsonline.net/currents/united-church-christ-central-atlantic-conference-passes-resolution-calling-washington-nfl-team-name-change-calls-member-boycott/|title=UCC Central Atlantic Conference Passes Resolution Calling for Washington NFL Team Name Change &amp; Calls for Member Boycott|date=June 15, 2014|publisher=Native News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/redskins/2014/06/14/church-of-christ-boycott-washington-redskins-name/10524269/|title=Church group latest to boycott Redskins over name|author=Erik Brady|date=June 14, 2014|newspaper=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution and boycott was passed by the National Synod of the UCC in June, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.19actionnews.com/story/29433519/cleveland-church-calling-on-the-washington-redskins-to-change-its-name-logo| title=Cleveland church calls on Washington Redskins to change name, logo| date=June 29, 2015| author=Scott Taylor| publisher=19 Action News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other team names and ethnic groups===

Opponents also argue there is a double standard of Native Americans being the only racial group depicted in sports. The only current exception may be the [[Coachella Valley High School]] "Arabs"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/07/arab-team-mascot-ethnic-slur/3461059/|title=California high school's Arab mascot draws ire|date=November 7, 2013|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has also been the subject of controversy, resulting in the retirement of its more cartoonish representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/education/2014/09/09/mighty-arab-coachella-valley-high/15368751/|title='Mighty Arab' takes its place at Coachella Valley High|author=Brett Kelman|newspaper=The Desert Sun|date=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Notre Dame]] [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish|Fighting Irish]] and the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]]'s "[[Louisiana–Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns|Ragin' Cajuns]]" are sometimes cited as counterpoints to this argument.&lt;ref name=morgan&gt;{{cite news|last=Morgan|first=Ron|title=Red Scare: McCarthy had nothing on the PC police|url=http://www.corsicanadailysun.com/sports/article_b76efcf1-9d5b-5a45-92f4-d4e4e17cbbf5.html|accessdate=October 20, 2014|newspaper=Corsicana Daily Sun|date=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These team names are exceptions, in that they represent ethnic groups with an active stake in the organization, and the teams employ symbols that European American cultures have historically used to represent themselves. The [[University of Notre Dame]] mascot, the [[Notre Dame Leprechaun|UND leprechaun]]&lt;ref name="ND"&gt;[http://und.cstv.com/trads/nd-m-fb-mas.html Notre Dame Fighting Irish - Traditions: The Leprechaun], University of Notre Dame Athletics&lt;/ref&gt; is a mythical being that represents the [[Irish people|Irish]], which is both an ethnic and a national group.&lt;ref name="fearson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fearon|first=James|title=Ethnic and Cultural Diversity by Country|journal=Journal of Economic Growth|year=2003|volume=8|issue=2|pages=195–222|url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/fearon-research/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Ethnic-and-Cultural-Diversity-by-Country.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''., Ireland has an ethnic fractionalization score of 0.171, meaning that there is only a 17.1% chance that two randomly selected people in Ireland will be from different ethnic groups.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cayenne (mascot)|University of Louisiana at Lafayette mascot]] is an anthropomorphic [[Cayenne (mascot)|cayenne pepper]], an ingredient frequently found in [[Cajun cuisine]]. Opponents also see this argument as a false equivalency, because it ignores systemic inequality, and serves to discount the Native American voice by saying that if one group isn't hurt by a particular portrayal, then no group has the right to be hurt, regardless of vastly different backgrounds, treatment, and social positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2008/10/05/notre-dames-fighting-irish-mascot|title=Sociological Images by Gwen Sharp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Commission on Civil Rights|U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] has called for an end to the use of Native American mascots, but only by non-native schools.&lt;ref name=USCCR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccr.gov/press/archives/2001/041601st.htm |title=Statement of the United States Commission on Civil Rights on the use of Native American images and nicknames as sports symbols |accessdate=2007-10-21 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases where universities were founded to educate Native Americans, such mascots may not be examples of [[cultural appropriation]]. Examples include the [[Haskell Indian Nations Fighting Indians|Fighting Indians]] of the [[Haskell Indian Nations University]] and the [[University of North Carolina at Pembroke]], which continues to have a substantial number of native students, and close ties to the [[Lumbee]] tribe. Their nickname is the Braves, but the mascot is a [[red-tailed hawk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncp.edu/news/2005/braves_nickname.htm|title=NCAA: UNCP will keep the Braves|date=August 9, 2005|accessdate=February 1, 2013|publisher=University of North Carolina at Pembroke}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcac-naia.org/members.php |title=Member institutions |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Midlands Collegiate Athletic Conference |access-date=18 March 2015}}

==Popular opinion==

[[File:FedExField - Redskins Jaguars pregame field.jpg|thumb|right|210px|The Washington Redskins logo at FedEx Field, in Maryland]]
Some individuals who support the use of Native American mascots state that they are meant to be respectful, and to pay homage to Native American people.  Many have made the argument that Native American mascots focus on bravery, courage and fighting skills rather than anything derogatory. Karl Swanson, vice-president of the Washington Redskins professional football team, declared in the magazine ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that his team's name "symbolizes courage, dignity, and leadership," and that the "Redskins symbolize the greatness and strength of a grand people."&lt;ref name="bar"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Emert| first=Phyllis Raybin|year=2003| url=http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11134/Respect%20Winter%202003.pdf| title=Native American Mascots: Racial Slur or Cherished Tradition?| journal=Respect (newsletter)| publisher=New Jersey State Bar Foundation|volume=2| issue=2 (Winter 2003)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anil Adyanthaya, an attorney, wrote on June 5, 2005, "The use of [[Aztec]] or [[Seminole]] as a nickname by itself would not appear to be racist, as such names refer to a particular civilization rather than an entire race of people. In this way, they are no different from other school nicknames such as [[Troy|Trojans]] and [[Sparta]]ns (like Aztecs, ancient peoples) or [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish|Fighting Irish]] and [[Lebanon Valley College|Flying Dutchmen]] (like Seminoles, nationalities). Similarly, Warriors and Braves are no different from the fighting men of other cultures, like Vikings, Minutemen, or Musketeers (all current [[NCAA]] mascots, the first of which is also an [[NFL]] mascot) so it seems hard to argue that their use is uniquely demeaning in some way."&lt;ref name="globe"&gt;{{cite news|last=Adyanthaya|first=Anil|title=Sports, mascots, and Native Americans|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2005/06/05/sports_mascots_and_native_americans/|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=June 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not the names by themselves that are seen as uniquely insulting to Native Americans. [[Richard Lapchick|Dr. Richard Lapchick]], director emeritus of Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society, in an article: "Could you imagine people mocking African Americans in [[Blackface|black face]] at a game? Yet go to a game where there is a team with an Indian name and you will see fans with [[Body painting|war paint]] on their faces. Is this not the equivalent to black face?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lapchick/050825&amp;num=0|title=Mascots are a matter of respect|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others claim Native American mascots help promote the culture to those who might be unaware of its significance. [[Chief Illiniwek]], the former athletic symbol for the [[University of Illinois]], became the subject of protest in 1988.&lt;ref name="Spindel"/&gt; However, in 1990 the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois called the mascot a dignified symbol: "His ceremonial dance is done with grace and beauty. The Chief keeps the memory of the people of a great Native American tribe alive for thousands of Illinoisans who otherwise would know little or nothing of them. However, the tribal costume was not of the [[Illinois Confederation]], but that of the [[Lakota people|Lakota tribe]]. The [[Peoria (tribe)|Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma]] is the closest living descendants of the Illiniwek Confederacy; and in 2005, John P. Froman, the new Chief when asked his position by the NCAA, indicated that "Chief (Illiniwek) was not representative of our tribe and culture, mainly because the costume is [[Sioux]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Daily Illini|first=Courtney|last=Linehan|url=http://www.dailyillini.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&amp;uStory_id=7d161c2c-6bd4-466a-bffa-92e7825e264e |title=Illiniwek appeal denied|date=November 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, in response to a widely published column by journalist [[George Will]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0190-8286| last = Will| first = George F.| title = Chief Among the Silliness| work = The Washington Post| accessdate = 2014-10-17| date = 2006-01-05| url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/04/AR2006010401590.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; in support of the symbol's use, Forman wrote a letter reiterating the Peoria Tribe's opposition to the symbol and decrying that the "University of Illinois has ignored the tribe’s request for nearly five years."&lt;ref&gt;John P.

Native American scholar Cornel Pewewardy has collected many statements made by non-natives when attempting to address racial issues, and places them in four categories:
#Avoidance: Statements that prevent discussion by changing the topic
#Disavowal: "But we are honoring you" or other statements that claim a problem does not exist
#Dismissal/Patronizing: Making statements based upon their own assumption of superiority 
#Re-Centering: Statements that attempt to redefine the issue as non-existent or trivial, such as calling it "[[political correctness]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 10683844| volume = 11| issue = 1| pages = 23–28| last = Pewewardy| first = Cornel| title = 100 defensive tactics and attributions: Dodging the Dialog on Cultural Diversity| journal = Multicultural Education| accessdate = 2014-11-21| date = 2003| url = http://search.proquest.com.mutex.gmu.edu/docview/216471437?accountid=14541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion surveys===
In 2001, ''[[Indian Country Today Media Network|Indian Country Today]]'' conducted a poll of an undisclosed number of readers reporting that "81 percent of respondents indicated use of American Indian names, symbols and mascots are predominantly offensive and deeply disparaging to Native Americans." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/ictarchives/2001/08/07/american-indian-opinion-leaders-american-indian-mascots-84807|title=AMERICAN INDIAN OPINION LEADERS: American Indian Mascots|date=August 7, 2001|newspaper=Indian Country Today|accessdate=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey conducted in 2002 by [[Harris Interactive|The Harris Poll]] for [[Sports Illustrated]] (SI) found that 81 percent of Native Americans who live outside traditional Indian reservations and 53 percent of Indians on reservations did not find the images discriminatory. The authors of the article concluded that "Although most Native American activists and tribal leaders consider Indian team names and mascots offensive, neither Native Americans in general nor a cross section of U.S. sports fans agree. According to the article, There is a near total disconnect between Indian activists and the Native American population on this issue." An Indian activist commented on the results saying "that Native Americans' self-esteem has fallen so low that they don't even know when they're being insulted."&lt;ref name=PriceWoo&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.si.com/vault/2002/03/04/319584/the-indian-wars-the-campaign-against-indian-nicknames-and-mascots-presumes-that-they-offend-native-americans--but-do-they-we-took-a-poll-and-you-wont-believe-the-results| author = S.L. Price| title = The Indian Wars| work = Sports Illustrated| date = March 4, 2002| pages=66–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the SI article, a group of five social scientists experienced in researching the mascot issue published a journal article arguing against the validity of this survey and its conclusions. First they state that "The confidence with which the magazine asserts that a 'disconnect' between Native American activists and Native Americans exists on this issue belies the serious errors in logic and accuracy made in the simplistic labeling of Native Americans who oppose mascots as 'activists.'" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jss.sagepub.com/content/26/4/381|title=Of Polls and Race Predudice|DOI=10.1177/0193732502238255|journal=Journal of Sport and Social Issues|date=November 2002|volume=26|issue=4|page=381|author1=C.

(2002) Methodology for ''Sports Illustrated'' survey on the use of Indian nicknames, mascots, etc. Document produced by The Peter Harris Research Group and shared with Ellen Staurowsky in January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent surveys, rather than addressing the larger issue, have targeted the controversy over the name of the Washington Redskins, asking if the word is offensive or if it should be changed. By a large majority (71-89 percent), public opinion has maintained that the name should not change, but when additional questions were asked also have found that the same respondents said "redskin" is not an appropriate term for Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/06/25/National-Politics/Polling/release_246.xml?44|title=Should the Washington Redskins change their name?|date=July 30, 2013|accessdate=October 16, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; See: [[Washington Redskins name controversy#Public opinion|Redskins Public Opinion Polls]].

A flaw unique to polls of Native Americans is they rely upon self-identification to select the target population. In an editorial in the [[The Herald-Times|Bloomington Herald Times]], Steve Russell (an enrolled [[Cherokee]] citizen and associate professor of criminal justice at [[Indiana University]]), states that both SI and Annenberg's samples of "self-identified Native Americans... includes plenty of people who have nothing to do with Indians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iupui.edu/~mstd/e320/amerind/flap.html|title=Some collected materials about the NCAA's decision to ban Indian sports mascots from the Indianapolis area|accessdate=January 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals claiming to be Native American when they are not is well known in academic research, and people claiming Indian identity specifically to gain authority in the debate over sports mascots has been criticised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Springwood|first=Charles|title="I’m Indian Too!": Claiming Native American Identity, Crafting Authority in Mascot Debates|publisher=Journal of sport and social issues|date=February 2004|volume=28|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Center for Indigenous Peoples Studies at [[California State University]], San Bernardino a survey has conducted of 400 individuals whose identity as Native American was verified, finding that 67% agreed with the statement that "Redskins" is offensive and racist. The response from non-natives was almost the opposite, with 68% responding that the name is not offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzfeed.com/lindseyadler/native-americans-offended-by-racial-slur|title=New Study Finds 67% Of Native Americans Find Redskins Name Offensive|publisher=Buzzfeed.com|date=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cips.csusb.edu/docs/PressRelease.pdf|title=Survey on Redskins team name found most American Indians believe it to be offensive and racist.|accessdate=June 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial impact of change===
Many supporters of Native American mascots feel that the financial cost of changing mascots would far outweigh the benefits.  Sales of merchandise with team mascots and nicknames ranging from T-shirts to beer cozies generate millions of dollars in sales each year, and teams contend that a change in team mascots would render this merchandise useless.&lt;ref name="bar"/&gt; The cost of removing images from uniforms and all other items, which must be paid out of local school funds, is a greater factor for secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mailtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120518/NEWS/205180322|title=State bans Native American mascots|date=May 18, 2012|first=Sanne|last=Specht|newspaper=Mail Tribune|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents feel that despite the cost of a change in team mascots, it should be done to prevent what they believe is racial stereotyping. [[Clyde Bellecourt]], when director of the [[American Indian Movement]] stated: "It's the behavior that accompanies all of this that's offensive.  The rubber [[Tomahawk (axe)|tomahawks]], the chicken [[War bonnet|feather headdresses]], people wearing [[Body painting|war paint]] and making these ridiculous [[Battle cry|war whoops]] with a tomahawk in one hand and a beer in the other; all of these have significant meaning for us. And the psychological impact it has, especially on our youth, is devastating."&lt;ref name="bar"/&gt;

One attempt to affect the use of mascots financially is the case brought against the Washington Redskins to revoke their trademarks.(See: ''[[Native American mascot controversy#Washington Redskins|Washington Redskins]]'' below.)

A study done by the [[Emory University]] [[Goizueta Business School]] indicates that the growing unpopularity of Native American mascots is a financial drain for professional teams, losing money compared to more popular animal mascots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.emory.edu/sportsmarketing/2013/12/19/the-financial-impact-of-mascots-on-sports-brands/?_ga=1.256951951.500422532.1397069844b|title=The Financial Impact of Mascots on Sports Brands|publisher=Emory University|date=December 19, 2013|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends==

===Legal and administrative action===
Statewide laws or school board decisions have been made in a small number of states with significant Native American populations. Several legislative and administrative actions have been made specifically with regard to schools using the name "Redskins".(See Below)

There has been backlash, however. In response to the [[Tennessee Commission of Indian Affairs]] seeking a similar ban though the Tennessee Human Rights Commission, the [[Tennessee Senate]] passed a law allowing only elected officials (themselves) to take any action banning school teams using American Indian names and symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesnews.net/article/3758873/tennessee-senate-approves-measure-that-would-protect-indian-mascots|title=Tennessee Senate approves measure that would protect Indian mascots|date=May 10, 2007|author=Hank Hayes}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seattle-area Issaquah School District adopted a policy banning symbols based on racial stereotypes; resulting in a change of the [[Issaquah High School]] team from the "Indians" to the "Eagles" in 2003 over the protest of some students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Issaquah-High-School-changes-mascot-1118097.php|title=Issaquah High School changes mascot|author=THE ASSOCIATED PRESS|date=June 26, 2003|accessdate=2014-01-06|publisher=Hearst Seattle Media, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 a law was passed in [[Wisconsin]] to eliminate race-based nicknames, logos and mascots in schools; but allowing retention if they have the permission of local Native American tribes. Many mascots were changed either voluntarily or in response to complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-10-06-kewaunee-school-mascot_N.htm | work=USA Today | first=Judy | last=Keen | title=Wis. law lets residents challenge race-based mascots | date=Oct 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However in October 2013 the law was changes to make it more difficult by requiring the complainant to collect signatures of 10% of the school district's population and prove discrimination, while under the 2010 law only one petitioner is needed, and the burden of proof is on the school to disprove racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.twincities.com/politics/ci_24316907/wisconsin-assembly-approves-bill-protecting-indian-mascots?source=rss|title=Wisconsin Assembly approves bill protecting Indian mascots|author=Todd Richmond|publisher=Associated Press|date=2013-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although now allowed to do so, some schools that have already made a change have decided not to restore their prior mascots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/education/wis-high-school-won-t-bring-back-indian-mascot-1.669912l|title=Wisconsin high school won't bring back Mukwonago Indian mascot after fighting to keep it|author=DINESH RAMDE, Associated Press|date=February 1, 2014|publisher=NewJersey.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native American groups opposed the change in the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wislawjournal.com/2013/11/17/opponents-urge-walker-to-veto-mascots-bill/|title=Opponents urge Walker to veto mascots bill|date=November 17, 2013|author=Associated Press|publisher=Wisconsin Law Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cdcgamingreports.com/menominee-leader-criticizes-wis-school-mascot-law/|title=Menominee leader criticizes Wis. school mascot law|author=TODD RICHMOND|publisher=Associated Press|date=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Delivering the State of the Tribes address to the Wisconsin legislature in March, 2015; [[Sokaogon Chippewa Community|Mole Lake Sokaogon]] Chairman Chris McGeshik stated: "We believe the recent decision to override the progress made with the state in regard to the school mascots to be a mockery of the indigenous people in the state and around America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.wrn.com/2015/03/sokoagan-chair-changes-to-mascot-law-a-mockery-of-indigenous-people/| title=Sokaogon chair: changes to mascot law ‘a mockery of indigenous people’| date=March 5, 2015| author=Bob Hague| publisher=Wisconsin Radio Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, 2012, the Oregon State Board of Education voted 5-1 to adopt a rule prohibiting Oregon public schools from using Native American names, symbols, or images as school mascots. Schools have until July 1, 2017 to comply.

Prompted by the concerns of Native Americans, the [[Madison Metropolitan School District]] in Wisconsin has implemented a policy banning student clothing having "words, pictures, or caricatures based on negative stereotypes of a specific gender, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual orientation or disability", which would ban all sports apparel displaying Native American mascot names, images or logos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://lacrossetribune.com/news/state-and-regional/madison-school-board-oks-ban-on-student-attire-with-indian/article_a3ff7f37-1b6c-5213-936d-2f70a91be78d.html| title=Madison School Board OKs ban on student attire with Indian mascots, logos| author=Pat Schneider| date=May 26, 2015| publisher=LaCrosse Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the ban may not pass the legal test that freedom of speech does not allow for a ban on expression unless there is a "substantial disruption of the educational mission".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/28/madison-wis-school-board-bans-student-clothing-with-native-american-team-names-logos-or-mascots-that-depict-negative-stereotypes/| title=Madison, Wis. school board bans student clothing with ‘Native American team names, logos or mascots that depict negative stereotypes’| author=Eugene Volokh| date=May 28, 2015| newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visiting athletic teams will also be asked to leave behind Native American mascots and logos, otherwise the game could be canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.wisconsingazette.com/trending/not-your-mascotbreakstudent-led-push-leads-madison-to-ban-native-american-sports-team-imagery.html| title=Not your mascot: Student-led push leads Madison to ban Native American sports team imagery| author=Lisa Neff| date=July 2, 2015| newspaper=Wisconsin Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colleges and universities===

[[File:Ticket Washington vs Stanford 1930 side1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|1930 Football ticket stub depicting the former Stanford Indian mascot]]
Some college teams voluntarily changed their names and mascots. [[Stanford University]] had "The Stanford Indian" as its mascot from 1930 to 1972. Today "[[Stanford Cardinal]]" honors the university athletic team color. The symbol of the [[Stanford Band]] is the "[[Stanford Tree]]." Another early change was the "[[Saltine Warrior#Mascot|Saltine Warrior]]" that represented [[Syracuse University]] from 1931 until 1978. After a brief attempt to use a Roman warrior, the mascot became [[Otto the Orange]] for the school color. [[Miami University]] began discussion regarding the propriety of the Redskins name and images in 1972, and changed its team nickname to [[Miami RedHawks|RedHawks]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miami.muohio.edu/about-miami/diversity/miami-tribe-relations/mascot-story/index.html|title=Mascot Story|accessdate=February 5, 2013|publisher=Miami University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the team name of [[Eastern Michigan University]] changed from the Hurons to the Eagles in 1991, the change remained controversial with some students and alumni who sought to restore it. In 2012 the university president brought back the Hurons logo, which was placed inside flap a of the band uniforms, along with another historic logo, with the stated intent of recognizing the past. However the return of the Hurons logo has prompted protests from Native Americans both students at the university and in the local community, who state that the old mascot promotes stereotypes and hostility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/06/16/eastern-michigan-university-hurons-logo/28797179/| title=Native Americans rally against Hurons logo at EMU| author=Kim Kozlowski| newspaper=The Detroit News| date=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/06/16/huron-logo-emu/28828217/| title=Community wants logo off EMU band uniforms| author=David Jesse| newspaper=Detroit Free Press |date=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one incident, a Native American man encountered some students wearing face paint and native costume. When asked what they were doing, some responded "We’re the F-ing Hurons!". When told that their behavior was racist, some responded with insults and a thrown beer can.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.heritage.com/articles/2015/04/20/ypsilanti_courier/news/doc55354a510383a396393253.txt| title=Ypsilanti man, Native American confronted dozens of EMU party-goers with 'red face'| date=April 20, 2015| author=Austen Smith| publisher=The Ypsilanti Courier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marquette University]] changed their team name from the Warriors to the Golden Eagles in 1994.  The school’s president stated:"We live in a different era than when the Warriors nickname was selected in 1954. The perspective of time has shown us that our actions, intended or not, can offend others. We must not knowingly act in a way that others will believe, based on their experience, to be an attack on their dignity as fellow human beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gomarquette.com/genrel/051105aaa.html|title=Trustees announce new nickname selection process|date=May 11, 2005|publisher=Marquette University|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1994, [[St. John's University (New York)]] changed the name of its athletic teams from the Redmen to the Red Storm after the university was pressured by American Indian groups who considered Redmen a slur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/09/nyregion/use-of-indians-as-mascots-to-be-subject-of-an-inquiry.html|title=Use of Indians As Mascots To Be Subject Of an Inquiry|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 9, 1998|accessdate=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2002, The Strategic Planning Committee of [[Stonehill College]] determined that the then-current mascot, the chieftain, was disrespectful to American Indians and decided that it would be changed. After discussion, the mascot was changed to the Skyhawk in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stonehillskyhawks.com/Why_A_Skyhawk|title=Why a Skyhawk?|accessdate=October 20, 2014|publisher=Stonehill College}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Jim Seavey, associate director of athletics stated: ''Twelve years ago, the college discarded the logo that depicted the Indian with the headdress and feathers and stuff. We really did not have anything to represent our identity that we were comfortable with. We felt . . . that it wasn't appropriate to have a physical representation of a Native American as our mascot," &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/02/27/digging_for_new_name_sends_stonehill_to_web/|title=Digging for new name sends Stonehill to Web|first=Emily|last=Sweeney|date=February 27, 2005|newspaper=The Boston Globe|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, teams that are not directly affected by this controversy have issued their opinions. The [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lssaa.wisc.edu/aisas/policy07.html|title=University Of Wisconsin Athletic Department Policy On Native American Logos And Names|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Iowa]] have both refused to schedule non-conference games against schools with Native American mascots. The University of Iowa's own nickname, "Hawkeyes", has Native American origins (Iowa is the "[[Hawkeye State]]"), although the team uses a [[hawk]] as its symbol rather than an Indian.

====National Collegiate Athletic Association====
The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA), the ruling authority on college athletics, distributed a "self evaluation" to 31 colleges in 2005, for teams to examine the use of potentially offensive imagery with their mascot choice.&lt;ref name="Hosick.20050314"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/NCAANewsArchive/2005/Association-wide/mascot%2Bmatter%2Bfits%2Binto%2Bproper-environment%2Bdiscussion%2B-%2B3-14-05%2Bncaa%2Bnews.html|title=Mascot matter fits into proper-environment discussion|date=March 14, 2005|first=Michelle|last=Brutlag Hosick|publisher=The NCAA News|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently 19 teams were cited as having potentially "hostile or abusive" names, mascots, or images, that would be banned from displaying them during post-season play, and prohibited from hosting tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/NCAANewsArchive/2005/Editorial/ncaa%2Bcorrectly%2Bpositioned%2Bas%2Ba%2Bcatalyst%2Bfor%2Bsocial%2Bchange%2B-%2B10-24-05%2Bncaa%2Bnews.html| title=NCAA correctly positioned as a catalyst for social change| date=October 24, 2005| first=Myles| last=Brand| publisher=National Collegiate Athletic Association| accessdate=January 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the colleges previously using Native American imagery changed except for those granted waivers when they obtained official support from individual tribes based upon the principle of [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|Tribal Sovereignty]].&lt;ref name="NCAI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncai.org/policy-issues/community-and-culture/anti-defamation-mascots|title=Anti-Defamation and Mascots|publisher=National Congress of American Indians|accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondary schools===
[[Secondary schools]] in both the United States and Canada have had histories similar to colleges, some making voluntary changes while others maintain their current mascots.

Relationships with tribes have been established at the high school level. [[Arapahoe High School (Centennial, Colorado)]] now uses a logo provided by the [[Arapaho]] Tribe of Wyoming, which initially included an agreement that the image would not be placed on the gym floor or any article of clothing. The latter provision has not always been observed, but the logo does not appear on the team uniforms. The agreement also includes tribal participation in school events.

====Canada====
Justice Murray Sinclair, the head of Canada's [[Truth and reconciliation commission|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] says "sports teams with offensive names, such as Redskins and cartoonish aboriginal-looking mascots have no place in a country trying to come to grips with racism in its past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Stop using offensive indigenous mascots in sports, Justice Murray Sinclair says| url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/11/15/stop-using-offensive-indigenous-mascots-in-sports-justice-murray-sinclair-says.html| author=Chinta Puxley| publisher=The Toronto Star| date=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brebeuf College School]], a Catholic all-boys school in [[North York]], [[Ontario]] changed its nickname to "Bulls" in 2004 after being called "Redmen" since 1963.

[[David and Mary Thomson Collegiate Institute]] in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Ontario]] had been the "Redmen" since 1959, which was changed to the  "Titans" in 2005.

Controversy over the name and logo of the [[Bedford Road Collegiate]] "Redmen" in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]] began in the 1990s, with a vote by students in 1996 choosing to keep things as they are.

====United States====

In January 2014 the [[Nez Perce people|Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee]] sent a letter to two northern Idaho school districts with American Indian mascots asking that they be changed. The mascots are the Sacajawea Junior High Braves in [[Lewiston School District|Lewiston]] and the [[Nezperce, Idaho|Nezperce]] High School Indians. The school officials state that they will have meetings and gather public opinions before making a decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/world/57451183-68/board-district-lewiston-mascot.html.csp|title= At request of American Indians, Idaho schools eye mascot name change|author=The Associated Press|date=January 26, 2014|publisher=The Salt Lake Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Dalles High School]] in [[The Dalles, Oregon]] will become the Riverhawks for Fall 2014 after being the "Indian Eagles" since 2000 after the merger of two schools. Although the Oregon legislature has allowed high schools to retain native mascots with the approval of a local tribe, the North Wasco County School District Superintendent Candy Armstrong states that, with 48 tribes in the area, "We thought [working with one] might not cause harmony but create more issues.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://highschoolsports.oregonlive.com/news/article/-3668039736778055308/the-dalles-becomes-latest-oregon-school-to-drop-native-american-mascot/|title=The Dalles becomes latest Oregon school to drop Native American mascot|author=Jerry Ulmer|date=August 29, 2014|publisher=The Oregonian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students of [[Belmont High School (New Hampshire)]] questioned the use of Native American imagery in connection to their name, the Red Raiders, saying that while it was never intended to be offensive it is time for a change.

[[Natick High School]] in [[Natick, Massachusetts]] was also the Redmen.

=====Redskins=====
:: {{see also|Non-NFL Redskins sports teams}}

High Schools with the name Redskins have received particular attention due to the media coverage of the Washington NFL team, including three which have a majority of Native American students. Advocates for the name conclude that because some Native Americans use the name to refer to themselves, it is not insulting.&lt;ref name=Spoken&gt;{{cite web |author=Rick Reilly |title=Have the people spoken? |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9689220/redskins-name-change-not-easy-sounds/ |website=ESPN |accessdate=October 15, 2013 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20130919035546/http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9689220/redskins-name-change-not-easy-sounds |archivedate=September 19, 2013 |deadurl=no |date=September 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the principal of one of these, [[Red Mesa High School]] in [[Teec Nos Pos, Arizona]], said that use of the word outside American Indian communities should be avoided because it could perpetuate "the legacy of negativity that the term has created."&lt;ref name="Michelle Peirano"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cronkitenewsonline.com/2013/05/in-debate-over-redskins-name-is-the-r-word-for-racism-or-respect/|title=In debate over Redskins name, is the 'R-word' for racism or respect?|date=May 1, 2013|author=Michelle Peirano|newspaper=Cronkite News|accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

As of early 2013, the ''Capitol News Service'' affiliated with the [[Philip Merrill College of Journalism]] of the [[University of Maryland]] listed twenty-eight high schools in 18 states that had dropped the "redskins" name during the prior 25 years as a result of a combination of state legal action, protests from Native American groups, or voluntarily; while 62 were listed as continuing to use the redskins name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cnsmaryland.org/interactives/other-redskins/#aboutproject|title=The Other Redskins|publisher=Capitol News Service|accessdate=June 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that list was compiled, an additional six high school teams have changed their name: [[Cooperstown, New York]] High School,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oneidaindiannation.com/pressroom/latestnews/Oneida-Indian-Nation-Congratulates-Cooperstown-Central-School-Board-for-Voting-to-Remove-Redskins-Mascot-196067191.html|title=Oneida Indian Nation Congratulates Cooperstown Central School Board for Voting to Remove Redskins Mascot|date=March 7, 2013|accessdate=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Port Townsend High School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.peninsuladailynews.com/article/20130625/NEWS/130629988/redskins-dropped-as-team-name-and-mascot-for-port-townsend-high|title='Redskins' dropped as team name and mascot for Port Townsend High School|author=Charlie Bermant|newspaper=Peninsula Daily News|date=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamar High School in [[Houston, Texas]],&lt;ref name="Troy Blevins"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.click2houston.com/news/houston-isd-votes-to-change-school-mascots/-/16714936/23463546/-/n5jf59z/-/index.html|title=Houston ISD votes to change school mascots|author=Troy Blevins|publisher=KPRC}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oklahoma City Public Schools|Capitol Hill High School, Oklahoma City]], &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/09/us-usa-oklahoma-redskins-idUSKBN0JN27T20141209| title=Oklahoma City high school drops the name 'Redskins' for its team| author=Heide Brandes| publisher=Reuters| date=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lancaster High School (Lancaster, New York)]], &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Redskins Nickname Is Dropped by School District in Upstate New York |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/17/sports/upstate-school-district-drops-redskins-nickname.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |location=[[Lancaster, New York]] |date=16 March 2015 |access-date=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Goshen High School (Indiana)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.journalgazette.net/sports/high-schools/goshen-board-approves-redhawks-mascot-9962707| date=November 17, 2015| title=Goshen board approves RedHawks mascot| author=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Youth leagues===
In addition to schools, there are many teams for young players using Native American names that participate in [[Little league baseball]] and [[Pop Warner Little Scholars]] football as well as other youth leagues, some of which are sponsored by professional teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/cle/fan_forum/youth_baseball.jsp| title=Youth Baseball| accessdate=September 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ian Champeau, an [[Ojibway]] man in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]] filed a human rights complaint against the Nepean Redskins Football Club on behalf of his five-year-old daughter in an effort to get the team to change its name. "How are they going to differentiate the playing field from the school yard? What’s going to stop them from calling my daughter a redskin in the school yard? That’s as offensive as using the [[Nigger#The N-word euphemism|n-word]]." [[Assembly of First Nations]] National Chief Shawn A-in-chut Atleo said he supports the move because the word Redskin is "offensive and hurtful and completely inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/09/04/redskins-human-rights-complaint-a-tribe-called-red_n_3866220.html|title=Nepean Redskins Human Rights Complaint: A Tribe Called Red Member Takes Football To Tribunal| publisher=HuffPost Canada Music| author=Jason MacNeil| date=September 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niigaan Sinclair ([[Anishinaabe]]), a writer and assistant professor at the [[University of Manitoba]] applauds the decision and contrasts it to the decision of [[Daniel Snyder]], the Washington team owner. Citing the combination of the stereotype of the Indian with sports in the early 20th century: "The marriage of the [[Sioux]]-like warrior name and image to sports was complete, celebrating and re-telling American violence against indigenous communities every time one appears on sports highlights.

===Professional teams===
None of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) teams that previously used Native American mascots continue to do so. The [[Atlanta Hawks]] were originally the [[Quad Cities|Tri-Cities]] Blackhawks (using an "Indian" logo)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nba/tri/tricities.html| title=Tri-Cities Blackhawks (1946-1951)| accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; before [[relocation of professional sports teams|moving]] to [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]] and changing its name to Hawks in 1951. The former [[Buffalo Braves]] relocated to [[San Diego]] in 1978, and are now known as the [[Los Angeles Clippers]].

The [[Golden State Warriors]], originally known as the Philadelphia Warriors before moving to [[San Francisco]] in 1962, eliminated Native American imagery in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/uniforms_warriors.html|title=Going Retro: Golden State Warriors|publisher=NBA|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, their logos have emphasized the state of [[California]], with their current primary logo depicting the [[Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge|new eastern span]] of the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]]. The warrior depicted on logos used from 1997-2010 was a generic lightning-wielding figure.

====Atlanta Braves====
The [[Atlanta Braves]] remain the home of the tomahawk chop (although it began at [[Florida State University]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/atl/video/v21042257/this-is-why-we-chop-the-history-of-the-tomahawk-chop|title=The history of the tomahawk chop| accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo has changed through the years from an Indian in full headdress to a Indian with a [[Mohawk hairstyle]] and single feather (described as either laughing or shouting), then to the Braves name in script over a tomahawk. The mascot [[Chief Noc-A-Homa]] was replaced in 1986. The current mascot is "Homer the Brave".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/atl/fan_forum/homer_braves.jsp| title=Homer the Brave| accessdate=September 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chicago Blackhawks====
The [[National Hockey League]] (NHL)'s [[Chicago Blackhawks]] was named in honor of the [[86th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 86th Infantry Division]], which was nicknamed the "Blackhawk Division" after [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]], a Native American chief; the team's founder, [[Frederic McLaughlin]], having served in that division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2013/06/17/baffoe-should-the-blackhawks-ditch-their-indian-head-logo/|title=Should The Blackhawks Ditch Their Indian Head Logo?|author=Tim Baffoe|date=2013-06-17|publisher=CBS Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The team's primary logo is a Native American's profile. In 2008, the staff of ''[[The Hockey News]]'' voted the team's logo to be the best in the NHL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehockeynews.com/articles/17432-THNcoms-NHL-Logo-Rankings.html |title=THN.com's NHL Logo Rankings |publisher=The Hockey News |date=2008-08-01 |accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate logo is a block "C" with crossed tomahawks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sportslogos.net/logos/list_by_team/7/Chicago_Blackhawks/| title=Chicago Blackhawks Logos| accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blackhawks mascot is [[NHL mascots#Tommyhawk|"Tommy Hawk"]], an anthropomorphic bird who also wears the four feathers worn by the logo figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://blackhawks.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=46626| title=Tommy Hawk - Chicago Blackhawks| accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suzan Shown Harjo]] of the Morning Star Institute, a Washington-based advocacy group, has said that the typical Native American logo, "relegates native people to a certain time in history that's not today, and it's intended to do so. It's not something that reflects anything that's current. It kind of keeps us in the backwater of history." Harjo says the Blackhawks have escaped the scrutiny given to other teams using Native imagery because [[hockey]] is not a cultural force on the level of [[football]]. But she says national American Indian organizations have called for an end to all Indian-related mascots and that she found the hockey team's name and Indian head symbol to be offensive. "It lacks dignity," she said. "There's dignity in a school being named after a person or a people. There's dignity in a health clinic or hospital. There's nothing dignified in something being so named (that is used for) recreation or entertainment or fun." The National Congress of American Indians also opposes the Blackhawks' logo, as it does all Native American mascots. &lt;ref name=Keilman.2013&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-06-19/news/ct-met-indian-mascots-20130619_1_american-indians-black-hawk-mascots| title=Protests rare over Blackhawks' name, logo: While critics say use of Indian mascots perpetuates outdated image, hockey club says it has mutually beneficial ties with local community| date=June 19, 2013| author=John Keilman| newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, sports columnist [[Damien Cox]] called on the franchise to retire the "racially insensitive" logo, saying that: "Clearly, no right-thinking person would name a team after an aboriginal figure these days any more than they would use [[Muslim]]s or [[Ethnic groups of Africa|Africans]] or [[Chinese people|Chinese]] or any ethnic group to depict a specific sporting notion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Damien|last=Cox|url=http://www.thestar.com/sports/hockey/nhl/article/815709--cox-offensive-blackhawks-logo-has-got-to-go |title=Cox: Offensive Blackhawks logo has got to go &amp;#124; Toronto Star |publisher=Thestar.com |date=2010-05-28 |accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Blackhawks have worked with the [[American Indian Center]] to help educate their community and fan base by sharing Native American culture and history. Scott Sypolt, Executive Counsel for the American Indian Center weighed in on the logo and name controversy by stating, "There is a consensus among us that there’s a huge distinction between a sports team called the Redskins depicting native people as red, screaming, ignorant savages and a group like the Blackhawks honoring Black Hawk, a true Illinois historical figure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Neveau |first=James |url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/madhouse-enforcer/Blackhawks-Making-Effort-to-Engage-Chicagoland-Native-Americans-228360071.html#ixzz3SEGTm0zY |title=Blackhawks Avoid Backlash -- For Now -- by Engaging Native American |work=NBC Chicago |date=2013-10-18 |accessdate=2015-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, this stance is markedly different from the one previously taken by the American Indian Center, with the shift coming only in the past few years. In 2010, for instance, Joe Podlasek stated that, "The stance is very clear. We want the Chicago Blackhawks logo to change. For us, that's one of our grandfathers. Would you do that with your grandfather's picture? Take it and throw it on a rug? Walk on it and dance on it?" &lt;ref&gt;http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/06/19/wearing-someone-elses-culture-more-chicago-blackhawks-149980&lt;/ref&gt; John Blackhawk, Chairman of the [[Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska]], has suggested that the change in position for the American Indian Center may be connected to contributions the Blackhawks organization has recently begun making to the center: "We all do contributions, but we don't do it for the sake of wanting to be forgiven for something we've done that's offensive."&lt;ref name=Keilman.2013/&gt;

Ghislain Picard, the head of the [[Assembly of First Nations]] of Quebec and Labrador, says he would support the change of the logo to one designed by an [[Ojibwe]] artist featuring a black hawk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/chicago-blackhawks-logo-ghislain-picard-1.3305487?cmp=abfb| title=Chicago Blackhawks logo of actual black hawk gets support of Quebec First Nations chief| publisher=CBC News| date=November 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The owner of the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[Winnipeg Jets]] has decided to ban fake Native headdresses at games after meeting with First Nations leaders. The meeting took place in response to a compliant by a Jets fan after seeing a Blackhawks fan in a headdress last season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/11/11/winnipeg-jets-ban-fake-native-headdresses-162405| title=Winnipeg Jets Ban Fake Native Headdresses| author=Vincent Schilling| date=November 11, 2015| publisher=Indian Country Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Edmonton Eskimos====
The [[Edmonton Eskimos]] is an exceptional case, given that the only stereotypical element appears to be the name of one of their mascots, [[Nanook]], a [[polar bear]]. The name [[Eskimo]] originated as a word used by the [[Cree]] to refer to the [[Inuit]], who are few in the Edmonton area, and are ambivalent or supportive of the team name. A notable Inuk who openly supported the team name was former Edmonton Eskimo player Dave Ward, now better known as [[Kiviaq (lawyer)|Kiviaq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/washington-redskins-fight-could-put-pressure-on-edmonton-eskimos-1.2680161|title=Washington Redskins fight could put pressure on Edmonton Eskimos|author=Matt Kwong|publisher=CBC|date=June 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/should-the-edmonton-eskimos-change-their-name-1.2683145| title=Should the Edmonton Eskimos change their name? | date=June 20, 2014| publisher=CBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kansas City Chiefs====

In 1963 the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] adopted a name referring to Native Americans, when the Dallas Texans (AFL) relocated. While adopting Native American imagery, the team was named in honor of Kansas City mayor [[Harold Roe Bartle]] who was instrumental in bringing the Texans to [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. Bartel earned his nickname as founder of a [[Boy Scouts]] honor camping society [[Tribe of Mic-O-Say]] in which he was "Chief" Lone Bear. In 1989 the Chiefs switched from [[Warpaint (mascot)|Warpaint]], a [[Pinto horse]] ridden by a man in a feathered headdress, to their current mascot [[K. C. Wolf]]. Warpaint returned in 2009, but is ridden by a [[Cheerleading|cheerleader]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcchiefs.com/cheerleaders/warpaint.html|title=Warpaint|publisher=Kansas City Chiefs|accessdate=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the appearance of photographs of fans attending an October 2013 game wearing feathers and warpaint—and doing the tomahawk chop—in the ''[[Kansas City Star]]'', numerous Native Americans submitted complaints to the publication. One caller, who was especially upset that the photographs were published on [[Columbus Day]], described the images as a "mockery" and "racist". Writing for the ''Star'''s "Public Editor" column, Derek Donovan explained that he found the complaints "reasonable" and suggested that the newspaper depict "other colorful, interesting people in the crowds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/2013/10/27/4577055/fans-indian-dress-is-problematic.html|title=Chiefs fans’ ‘Indian’ dress is problematic|date=October 27, 2013|author=DEREK DONOVAN|newspaper=The Kansas City Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Kansas City Star'' reported in early August 2014 that the team's management is planning discussions with some Native American groups to find a non-confrontational way to eliminate, or at least reduce, offensive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/sam-mellinger/article1161612.html|title= To avoid a cultural free-for-all, Chiefs form alliance with American Indian groups|author=SAM MELLINGER|newspaper=The Kansas City Star|date=August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amanda Blackhorse, the lead plaintiff in the trademark case against the Washington Redskins, thinks the real solution is a name change for the Chiefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/sam-mellinger/article618354.html|title= Woman behind fight against Washington’s NFL nickname says Chiefs should be on guard|author=SAM MELLINGER|newspaper=The Kansas City Star|date=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native Americans in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] picketed at the game between the Chiefs and the [[Arizona Cardinals]], and have asked the Cardinals' management to bar "[[Redface]]", the wearing of headdresses and face paint, protesting what they perceive to be a mockery of Native American culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/valleyfever/2014/12/native_americans_calling_on_arizona_cardinals_to_make_policy_against_headdr.php| title=Native Americans Calling on Arizona Cardinals to Make Policy Against Headdresses, Redface| author=Matthew Hendley| date=December 10, 2014| publisher=Phoenix New Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; A protest is planned in Minnesota when the Chiefs play the Vikings on October 18, 2015.

Team owner [[Daniel Snyder]] sent an open letter to fans that was published in ''The Washington Post'' on October 9, 2013.

===International teams===
The [[United States national rugby league team]] was marketed as the Tomahawks until 2015, when the team was rebranded to simply 'Hawks'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rlif.com/rugby-league-international-news/article/1564/welcome-the-usa-hawks Welcome the USA Hawks]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other issues==

===Stereotyping by rival fans===

In addition to the behavior of the teams that have Native American names or mascots, their rivals often invoke racist stereotypes. In [[Alabama]], at a game between the [[Pinson Valley High School]] "Indians" and [[McAdory High School]], the latter team displayed a banner using a disparaging reference to the ''[[Trail of Tears]]'' for which the principal of the school apologized to Native Americans, stating that the cheerleader squad responsible would be disciplined, and that all students would be given a lesson on the actual history of the Trail of Tears. Native Americans responded that it was an example of the continuing insensitivity and stereotyping of Indians in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/11/18/21523300-alabama-principal-apologizes-for-trail-of-tears-banner-at-high-school-football-game|title=Alabama principal apologizes for 'Trail of Tears' banner at high school football game|author=Simon Moya-Smith|publisher=NBC News|date=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/Blog/2013/11/19/McAdory-High-School-in-Alabama-apologizes-for-Trail-of-Tears-sign/5471384871891/|title=McAdory High School in Alabama apologizes for 'Trail of Tears' sign|author=Evan Bleier|date=November 19, 2013|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar sign was displayed in [[Tennessee]] by the [[Dyersburg, Tennessee|Dyersburg]] Trojans when they played the [[North Side High School (Jackson, Tennessee)|Jackson Northside Indians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/11/heres-another-high-school-football-team-promoting-trail-tears|title=Here's Another High School Football Team Promoting the "Trail of Tears"|author=Tim Murphy|date=November 21, 2013|publisher=Mother Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013 when the Washington NFL team played the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] an employee of a [[Sonic Drive-In]] in Missouri placed a message outside that used [[scalping]], [[Indian reservation|reservations]] and [[Whisky|whiskey]] to disparage the "Redskins". It was quickly removed with the owner's apologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2520773/Sonic-Drive-restaurant-upsets-racist-sign-scalp-Washington-Redskins.html|title=Fast food restaurant upsets customers with racist sign promising that the Kansas City Chiefs would 'scalp' the Washington Redskins|publisher=Daily Mail|author=Sara Malm|date=9 December 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rubber severed "Indian" head impaled on a knife is used by a sports fan in [[Philadelphia]] to taunt rival teams with Native American mascots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racialicious.com/2013/09/10/thanks-for-the-severed-head-you-proved-my-point/|title=Thanks for the severed head.

Although the [[Central Michigan Chippewas]] have the support of the [[Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Nation]] of [[Michigan]], a student at rival [[Western Michigan University]] designed a T-shirt showing a Native American behind bars with the legend "Caught a Chippewa about a week ago". It was quickly condemned by both university presidents, who agreed that anyone wearing the shirt at a game would be ejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.wwmt.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/WMU-CMU-presidents-offer-swift-action-following-t-shirt-controversy-59232.shtml#.VHacPtab2Q4| title=WMU, CMU presidents offer swift action following t-shirt controversy| date=November 22, 2014| publisher=WWMT-TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Varying degrees of offensiveness===
To further complicate this controversy, many feel that there are varying levels of offensiveness with team names and mascots. The nature and degree of stereotyping varies depending upon the name of the team, the logo, the mascot, and the behavior of fans. The greatest offense is taken when the logo and mascot are caricatures viewed as insulting, such as the [[Cleveland Indians]]' [[Chief Wahoo]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=5437|title=Coalition Of Religious Investors Fight Baseball Team Logo|date=July 10, 1997|accessdate=January 18, 2013|publisher=Catholic Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; the name of the team is often regarded as a racial slur, such as [[redskin (slang)|redskins]]; or the behavior of the mascot or fans is based upon popular images of Indians which trivialize authentic native cultures; such as the tomahawk chop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2013/5/1/4292152/yeah-the-tomahawk-chop-bugs-me-heres-why| title=Yeah, the "Tomahawk Chop" bugs me. Here's why| author=Mike Bates| date=May 1, 2013| publisher=SBNation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practices of individual schools and teams have changed in response to the controversy. A local example is [[Washington High School (Sioux Falls, South Dakota)|Washington High School]] in [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]]. Many Native American images have been removed, and the "Warriors" nickname is now claimed to be generic. The school now has a "circle of courage" logo with eagle feathers and has also "updated" the murals of Chief [[Hollow Horn Bear]] in the gym. Duane Hollow Horn Bear, the chief's great-grandson, who teaches Lakota language and history at [[Sinte Gleska University]] in Mission, stated: "We had no objection to their utilizing those pictures as long as my great-grandfather was represented with honor and dignity." However, not all Native Americans are happy with the presence of any such images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.argusleader.com/story/opinion/columnists/stu-whitney/2015/01/17/whitney-sioux-falls-team-indian-nickname/21925163/| title=Does Washington High have nickname problem?| author=Stu Whitney| date=January 17, 2015| publisher=Argus Leader}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
A database from 2013 shows that there are currently almost 2,000 high schools with mascots that reference native american culture. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Munguia|first1=Hayley|title=The 2,128 Native American Mascots People Aren’t Talking About|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-2128-native-american-mascots-people-arent-talking-about/|website=fivethirtyeight.com|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is down from around 3,000. &lt;ref name="NCAI"/&gt; Though changes have been made at the high school and college levels, at the professional level there has been virtually no change. The topic remains an issue on a national level, with a hearing before the US Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indian.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?hearingID=e655f9e2809e5476862f735da16ba74a|title=OVERSIGHT HEARING on Stolen Identities: The Impact of Racist Stereotypes on Indigenous People|date=May 5, 2011|accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a symposium at the Smithsonian [[National Museum of the American Indian]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian Institution"/&gt; In November, 2015 President Obama, speaking at the White House Tribal Nations Conference, stated "Names and mascots of sports teams like the Washington Redskins perpetuate negative stereotypes of Native Americans" and praised [[Adidas]] for a new initiative to help schools change names and mascots by designing new logos and paying for part of the cost of new uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/259331-obama-teams-should-drop-native-american-mascots| date=November 5, 2015| title=Obama: Teams should drop Native American mascots| author=Jordan Fabian| publisher=The Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;
