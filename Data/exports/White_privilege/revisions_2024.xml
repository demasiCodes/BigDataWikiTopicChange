'''White privilege''', or '''white skin privilege''', is the [[Social privilege|societal privilege]] that benefits [[white people]] over [[Person of color|non-white]] people in some societies, particularly if they are otherwise under the same social, political, or economic circumstances.&lt;ref name="phenomenon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Neville" /&gt; With roots in [[History of colonialism|European colonialism]] and [[New Imperialism|imperialism]],&lt;ref name="jamesstephens1824"/&gt; and the [[Atlantic slave trade]], white privilege has developed&lt;ref name="colonialismandbeyond2013"/&gt; in circumstances that have broadly sought to protect white racial privileges,&lt;ref name="modernpolitical2003"/&gt; various national citizenships, and other rights or special benefits.&lt;ref name="racialprofiling2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="livingracism2017"/&gt;

In the [[study of white privilege]] and its broader field of [[whiteness studies]], both pioneered in the United States, academic perspectives such as [[critical race theory]] use the concept to analyze how [[racism]] and [[racialized society|racialized societies]] affect the lives of white or white-skinned people.&lt;ref name="Banks-2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cole, Mike |title=Marxism and educational theory: origins and issues|date=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-39732-9|location=London|pages=36–49|oclc=182658565}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, American academic [[Peggy McIntosh]] described the advantages that whites in Western societies enjoy and non-whites do not experience as "an invisible package of unearned assets".&lt;ref name="Unpacking"/&gt; White privilege denotes both obvious and less obvious passive advantages that white people may not recognize they have, which distinguishes it from overt bias or prejudice. These include cultural affirmations of one's own worth; presumed greater social status; and [[freedom to move]], buy, work, play, and [[speak freely]]. The effects can be seen in professional, educational, and personal contexts. The concept of white privilege also implies the right to assume the universality of one's own experiences, marking others as different or exceptional while perceiving oneself as [[Normality (behavior)|normal]].&lt;ref name="Vice"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vice |first=Samantha |title=How Do I Live in This Strange Place? |journal=Journal of Social Philosophy |date=September 7, 2010 |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=323–342 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9833.2010.01496.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin-McDonald-2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin-McDonald |first=K |author2=McCarthy, A |title='Marking' the white terrain in indigenous health research: literature review. |journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing |date=January 2008 |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=126–33 |pmid=18186904 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2648.2007.04438.x|url=https://eprints.qut.edu.au/19655/1/19655.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars say that the term uses the concept of "whiteness" as a substitute for [[Social class|class]] or other social privilege or as a distraction from deeper underlying problems of inequality.&lt;ref name="Arnesen"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eric |last=Arnesen |title=Whiteness and the Historians' Imagination |journal=International Labor and Working-Class History |volume=60 |date=October 2001 |pages=3–32|doi=10.1017/S0147547901004380 |s2cid=202921126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hartigan, 2005 pp. 1"&gt;Hartigan, ''Odd Tribes'' (2005), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Others state that it is not that whiteness is a substitute but that many other social privileges are interconnected with it, requiring complex and careful analysis to identify how whiteness contributes to privilege.&lt;ref name="Privilege"/&gt; Other commentators propose alternative definitions of whiteness and exceptions to or limits of white identity, arguing that the concept of white privilege ignores important differences between white [[Statistical population|subpopulations]] and individuals and suggesting that the notion of whiteness cannot be inclusive of all white people.&lt;ref name="uws.edu.au"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Forrest |first1=James |last2=Dunn |first2=Kevin |title='Core' Culture Hegemony and Multiculturalism |journal=Ethnicities |date=June 2006 |volume=6 |number=2 |doi=10.1177/1468796806063753 |url=http://www.uws.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/29645/A23.pdf |pages=203–230|s2cid=16710756 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Privilege"/&gt; They note the problem of acknowledging the diversity of people of color and ethnicity within these groups.&lt;ref name="Privilege"/&gt;

Some commentators have observed that the "academic-sounding concept of white privilege" sometimes elicits defensiveness and misunderstanding among white people, in part due to how the concept of white privilege was rapidly brought into the mainstream spotlight through [[social media]] campaigns such as [[Black Lives Matter]].&lt;ref name="brydum"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brydum |first1=Sunnivie |title=The Year in Hashtags: 2014 |url=http://www.advocate.com/year-review/2014/12/31/year-hashtags |access-date=January 23, 2016 |agency=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |date=December 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an academic concept that was only recently brought into the mainstream, the concept of white privilege is frequently misinterpreted by non-academics; some academics, having studied white privilege undisturbed for decades, have been surprised by the recent opposition from [[right-wing]] critics since approximately 2014.&lt;ref name="weinburg"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Weinburg |first1=Cory |title=The White Privilege Moment |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/05/28/academics-who-study-white-privilege-experience-attention-and-criticism |access-date=January 19, 2016 |agency=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=May 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In historian [[William Miller Macmillan]]'s 1929 ''The Frontier and the Kaffir Wars, 1792–1836'', he describes the motivations of [[Afrikaner]] settlers to embark upon the [[Great Trek]] as an attempt to preserve their racial privilege over indigenous [[Khoisan]] people; "It was primarily land hunger and a determination to uphold white privilege that drove the Trekkers out of the colony in their hundreds". [[Cape Colony]] was administered by the [[British Empire]]. Their increasingly anti-slavery policies were seen as a threat by the Dutch-speaking settlers, who were afraid of losing their African and Asian slaves and their superior status as people of European descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge history of the British Empire|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.508933|author1=Macmillan, William Miller |editor1=John Holland Rose|editor2=Arthur Percival Newton|editor3=Ernest Alfred Benians|editor4=Henry Dodwell|date=1929|publisher=[[The Macmillan company]]|page=322|edition=Volume 8|chapter=The Frontier and the Kaffir Wars, 1792–1836}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, ''Zaire Church News'', a missionary publication in the [[Zaire]] area, confronted white privilege's impact from the [[European colonization]] of central and southern Africa, and its effects on [[black people]]'s progress in the region:

An address on ''Social Equities'', from a 1910 [[National Council of the Congregational Churches of the United States]] publication, demonstrates some of the earliest terminology developing in the concept of white skin privilege:
&lt;blockquote&gt;What infinite cruelties and injustices have been practiced by men who believed that to have a white skin constituted special privilege and who reckoned along with the divine rights of kings the divine rights of the white! We are all glad to take up the [[white man's burden]] if that burden carries with it the privilege of asserting the [[white supremacy|white man's superiority]], of exploiting the man of lesser breed, and making him know and keep his place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Council Fourteenth Triennial Session Addresses and Discussions|chapter=Social Equities|first1=George Luther |last1=Cady|date=1910|publisher=[[National Council of the Congregational Churches of the United States]]|location=[[Boston, Massachusetts]]|edition=October 10–20, Fourteenth Triennial Session|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his 1935 ''[[Black Reconstruction|Black Reconstruction in America]]'', [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] introduced the concept of a "psychological wage" for white laborers. He wrote that this special status divided the labor movement by leading low-wage white workers to feel superior to low-wage black workers.&lt;ref name=DuBois/&gt; Du Bois identified [[white supremacy]] as a global phenomenon affecting the social conditions across the world through colonialism.&lt;ref name="Leonardo"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leonardo | first1 = Zeus | year = 2010| title = The Souls of White Folk: critical pedagogy, whiteness studies, and globalization discourse | journal = Race Ethnicity and Education | volume = 5 | issue = 1| page = 2002 | doi = 10.1080/13613320120117180 | s2cid = 145354229 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Du Bois wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It must be remembered that the white group of laborers, while they received a low wage, were compensated in part by a sort of public and psychological wage. They were given public deference and titles of courtesy because they were white. They were admitted freely with all classes of white people to public functions, public parks, and the best schools. The police were drawn from their ranks, and the courts, dependent on their votes, treated them with such leniency as to encourage lawlessness. Their vote selected public officials, and while this had small effect upon the economic situation, it had great effect upon their personal treatment and the deference shown them. White schoolhouses were the best in the community, and conspicuously placed, and they cost anywhere from twice to ten times as much per capita as the colored schools. The newspapers specialized on news that flattered the poor whites and almost utterly ignored the Negro except in crime and ridicule.&lt;ref name="DuBois"&gt;Du Bois, W. E. B., ''Black Reconstruction in America, 1860–1880'' (New York: Free Press, 1995 reissue of 1935 original), pp. 700–701. {{ISBN|0-684-85657-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 1942 edition of ''[[Modern Review (Calcutta)|Modern Review]]'' magazine, [[Ramananda Chatterjee]] accused [[Winston Churchill]] of [[hypocritical]] policy positions, in his support, as Chatterjee viewed it, of racial equality in the UK and US but not in [[British India]]; "Mr Churchill can support white privilege and monopoly in India whilst opposing privilege and monopoly on both sides of the Atlantic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Modern Review|first1=Ramananda |last1=Chatterjee|author-link1=Ramananda Chatterjee|edition=Volume 71|date=1942|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, during [[World War II]], sociologist [[Alfred McClung Lee]]'s ''Race Riot, Detroit 1943'' addressed the "Nazi-like guarantee of white privilege" in American society:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[White Americans]] might well ask themselves: Why do whites ''need'' so many special advantages in their competition with Negroes? Similar tactics for the elimination of Jewish competition in [[Nazi Germany]] brought the shocked condemnation of the civilized world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Race riot, Detroit 1943|first1=Alfred |last1=McClung Lee|author-link1=Alfred McClung Lee|author2=Norman Daymond Humphrey|date=1943|publisher=The Dryden Press|location=[[University of Michigan]]|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===US civil rights movement===
{{Main|US civil rights movement}}
In the United States, inspired by the [[civil rights movement]], [[Theodore W. Allen]] began a 40-year analysis of "white skin privilege", "white race" privilege, and "white" privilege in a call he drafted for a "John Brown Commemoration Committee" that urged "White Americans who want government of the people" and "by the people" to "begin by first repudiating their white skin privileges".&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Theodore W., "A Call . . .

It focused on the struggle against "white skin privilege" and significantly influenced the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) and sectors of the [[New Left]]. By June 15, 1969, ''The New York Times'' reported that the National Office of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) was calling "for an all-out fight against 'white skin privileges'".&lt;ref&gt;See Ignatin (Ignatiev), Noel, and Ted (Theodore W.)

Allen. . . "&lt;/ref&gt; From 1974 to 1975, Allen extended his analysis to the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial]] period, leading to the publication of "Class Struggle and the Origin of Racial Slavery: The Invention of the White Race"&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Theodore W., [http://clogic.eserver.org/2006/allen.html Class Struggle and the Origin of Racial Slavery: The Invention of the White Race] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406121446/http://clogic.eserver.org/2006/allen.html |date=April 6, 2011 }} (Hoboken: Hoboken Education Project, 1975), republished in 2006 with an "Introduction" by Jeffrey B. Perry at Center for the Study of Working Class Life, SUNY, Stony Brook.&lt;/ref&gt; (1975), which ultimately grew into his two-volume ''The Invention of the White Race'' in 1994 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Theodore W., ''The Invention of the White Race'', Vol. I: Racial Oppression and Social Control (New York: Verso, 1994, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-84467-769-6}}) and Vol. II: The Origin of Racial Oppression in Anglo-America (New York: Verso, 1997, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-84467-770-2}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work, Allen maintained several points: that the "white race" was invented as a ruling class [[social control]] formation in the late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century Anglo-American plantation colonies (principally Virginia and Maryland); that central to this process was the ruling-class plantation bourgeoisie conferring "white race" privileges on European-American working people; that these privileges were not only against the interests of African-Americans, they were also "poison", "ruinous", a baited hook, to the class interests of working people; that white supremacy, reinforced by the "white skin privilege", has been the main retardant of working-class consciousness in the US; and that struggle for radical social change should direct principal efforts at challenging white supremacy and "white skin privileges".&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Jeffrey B., [http://clogic.eserver.org/2010/2010.html "The Developing Conjuncture and Insights from Hubert Harrison and Theodore W.

The modern understanding of 'white privilege' developed in the late 1980s, with [[Peggy McIntosh]] being considered one of the earliest exponents of the idea.&lt;ref name="m4505"&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Rothman | first=Joshua | title=The Origins of "Privilege" | magazine=[[The New Yorker]] | date=2014-05-12 | url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-origins-of-privilege | access-date=2024-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Study of the concept===
{{Main|Study of white privilege}}
The concept of white privilege also came to be used within radical circles for [[self-criticism]] by [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] whites. For instance, a 1975 article in ''[[Lesbian Tide]]'' criticized the American feminist movement for exhibiting "class privilege" and "white privilege". [[Weather Underground]] leader [[Bernardine Dohrn]], in a 1977 ''Lesbian Tide'' article, wrote: "...&amp;nbsp;by assuming that I was beyond white privilege or allying with male privilege because I understood it, I prepared and led the way for a totally opportunist direction which infected all of our work and betrayed revolutionary principles."&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;Bennett, Jacob (May 2012), "White Privilege: A History of the Concept", Master's Thesis at Georgia State University.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, the term gained new popularity in academic circles and public discourse after [[Peggy McIntosh]]'s 1987 foundational work "[[White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack]]".&lt;ref name="newyorker"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rothman|first=Joshua|title=The Origins of "Privilege"|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2014/05/the-woman-who-coined-the-term-white-privilege.html|access-date=May 14, 2014|magazine=[[The New Yorker]]|date=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin-McDonald-2008" /&gt; In this critique McIntosh made observations about conditions of advantage and dominance in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McIntosh |first=Peggy |author-link=Peggy McIntosh |date=1988 |title=WHITE PRIVILEGE AND MALE PRIVILEGE: A Personal Account of Coming to See Correspondences Through Work in Women's Studies |url=https://www.collegeart.org/pdf/diversity/white-privilege-and-male-privilege.pdf |website=www.collegeart.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; She described white privilege as "an invisible weightless knapsack of assurances, tools, maps, guides, codebooks, passports, visas, clothes, compass, emergency gear, and blank checks", and also discussed the relationships between different social hierarchies in which experiencing oppression in one hierarchy did not negate unearned privilege experienced in another.&lt;ref name="Unpacking"&gt;{{cite web|first1=Peggy|last1=McIntosh|author-link1=Peggy McIntosh|title=White privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack|url=http://people.westminstercollege.edu/faculty/jsibbett/readings/White_Privilege.pdf|access-date=January 19, 2016|archive-date=March 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307160330/http://people.westminstercollege.edu/faculty/jsibbett/readings/White_Privilege.pdf}} Independent School, Winter90, Vol. 49 Issue 2, p31, 5p&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Peggy McIntosh|McIntosh, Peggy]].

According to their poll, this view was affirmed by 59% of white respondents, 83% of Blacks, and 84% of Hispanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=American Mosaic Project |publisher=University of Minnesota |url=http://www.racialequitytools.org/resourcefiles/uminnesota.pdf |title=The Role of Prejudice and Discrimination in Americans' Explanations of Black Disadvantage and White Privilege |year=2006 |access-date=June 15, 2010 |archive-date=July 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727194415/http://www.racialequitytools.org/resourcefiles/uminnesota.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st-century popular culture===
The concept of White privilege marked its transition from academia to more mainstream prominence through [[social media]] in the early 2010s, especially in 2014, a year in which [[Black Lives Matter]] formed into a major movement and the word "hashtag" itself was added to [[Merriam-Webster]].&lt;ref name="brydum"/&gt; Brandt and Kizer, in their article "From Street to Tweet" (2015), discuss the American public's perception of the concept of privilege in mainstream culture, including white privilege, as being influenced by social media.&lt;ref name="brandt-kizer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brandt|first1=Jenn|last2=Kizer|first2=Sam|title=From Street to Tweet: Popular Culture and Feminist Activism|publisher=SensePublishers|isbn=978-94-6300-061-1|pages=115–127|doi=10.1007/978-94-6300-061-1_9|chapter=From Street to Tweet|year=2015|s2cid=155352216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hua Hsu]], a [[Vassar College]] professor of English, opens his ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' review of the 2015 [[MTV]] film [[White People (film)|''White People'']] by suggesting that white people have become aware of their privilege.&lt;ref name="huahsu-ny"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hsu|first1=Hua|title=The Trouble with "White People"|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-trouble-with-white-people|access-date=February 15, 2016|magazine=[[The New Yorker]]|date=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hsu ascribes this to generational change, which he considers a byproduct of the "[[Barack Obama|Obama]] era".&lt;ref name="huahsu-ny" /&gt;

The documentary ''White People'', produced by [[Jose Antonio Vargas]], follows a variety of white teenagers who express their thoughts and feelings about white privilege on-camera. Vargas interviews a white community college student, Katy, who attributes her inability to land a college scholarship to [[reverse racism]] against white people; then Vargas points out that white students are "40 percent more likely to receive merit-based funding".&lt;ref name="amyzimmerman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zimmeman|first1=Amy|title='White People': MTV Takes On White Privilege|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/20/white-people-mtv-takes-on-white-privilege.html|access-date=February 16, 2016|agency=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, hip-hop group [[Macklemore and Ryan Lewis]] released "[[White Privilege II]]", a single from their album ''[[This Unruly Mess I've Made]]'', in which [[Macklemore]] raps that he and other white performers have profited immensely from [[cultural appropriation]] of black culture, such as [[Iggy Azalea]].&lt;ref name="jagannathan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jagannathan|first1=Meera|title=Macklemore slams Miley Cyrus, Iggy Azalea for appropriating black culture, tackles racism and Black Lives Matter in new track 'White Privilege II'|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/macklemore-slams-miley-iggy-azalea-white-privilege-ii-article-1.2505788|access-date=January 23, 2016|agency=[[New York Daily News]]|date=January 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications in critical theory==

===Critical race theory===
{{Main|Critical race theory}}

The concept of white privilege has been studied by theorists of [[whiteness studies]] seeking to examine the construction and moral implications of 'whiteness'. There is often overlap between critical whiteness and [[Race (human categorization)|race]] theories, as demonstrated by focus on the legal and historical construction of white identity, and the use of narratives — whether legal discourse, testimony or fiction — as a tool for exposing systems of racial power.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Haney López, Ian F. ''White by Law''. 1995; Lipsitz, George. ''Possessive Investment in Whiteness''; Delgado, Richard; Williams, Patricia; and Kovel, Joel.&lt;/ref&gt; Fields such as history and cultural studies are primarily responsible for the formative scholarship of critical whiteness studies.

[[Critical race theory|Critical race theorists]] such as [[Cheryl Harris]]&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Cheryl I. |last=Harris|title=Whiteness as Property |journal=Harvard Law Review |volume=106 |issue=8|pages=1709–95 |date=June 1993 |doi=10.2307/1341787 |jstor=1341787}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Lipsitz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Lipsitz |first=George |author-link=George Lipsitz| title= The Possessive Investment in Whiteness: How White People Profit From Identity Politics|year=2006 |publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn= 978-1-59213-493-9|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PIqUajTEfk0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; have said that "whiteness" has historically been treated more as a form of [[property]] than as a racial characteristic: in other words, as an object which has intrinsic value that must be protected by social and legal institutions. Laws and [[mores]] concerning race — from [[apartheid]] and [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] constructions that legally separate different races to social prejudices against interracial relationships or mixed communities — serve the purpose of retaining certain advantages and privileges for whites. Because of this, academic and societal ideas about race have tended to focus solely on the disadvantages suffered by [[racial minorities]], overlooking the advantageous effects that accrue to whites.&lt;ref name="Lucal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lucal|first=Betsy|date=July 1996|title=Oppression and Privilege: Toward a Relational Conceptualization of Race|journal=Teaching Sociology|volume=24|issue=3|pages=245–55|issn=0092-055X|oclc=48950428|doi=10.2307/1318739|jstor=1318739|s2cid=51912528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Arnesen]], an American labor historian, reviewed papers from a whiteness studies perspective published in his field in the 1990s, and found that the concept of whiteness was used so broadly during that time period that it was not useful.&lt;ref name=Arnesen/&gt;

===Whiteness unspoken===
From another perspective, white privilege is a way of conceptualizing racial inequalities that focuses on advantages that white people accrue from their position in society as well as the disadvantages that non-white people experience.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Constraint of Race'' (2004), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; This same idea is brought to light by [[Peggy McIntosh]], who wrote about white privilege from the perspective of a white individual. McIntosh states in her writing that, "as a white person, I realized I had been taught about racism as something which puts others at a disadvantage, but had been taught not to see one of its corollary aspects, white privilege which puts me at an advantage".&lt;ref name="McIntosh, P. 1988 p. 1"&gt;[[Peggy McIntosh|McIntosh, P.]] (1988). "White privilege: Packing the invisible backpack. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; To back this assertion, McIntosh notes a myriad of conditions in her article in which racial inequalities occur to favor whites, from renting or buying a home in a given area without suspicion of one's financial standing, to purchasing bandages in "flesh" color that closely matches a white person's skin tone. According to McIntosh:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[I see] a pattern running through the matrix of white privilege, a pattern of assumptions which were passed on to me as a white person. There was one main piece of cultural turf; it was my own turf, and I was among those who could control the turf. My skin color was an asset for any move I was educated to want to make. I could think of myself as belonging in major ways, and of making social systems work for me. I could freely disparage, fear, neglect, or be oblivious to anything outside of the dominant cultural forms. Being of the main culture, I could also criticize it fairly freely.&lt;ref name="McIntosh, P. 1988 p. 1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thomas K. Nakayama and Robert L. Krizek argued that one reason whiteness remains unstated is that whiteness functions as the presumed and invisible center of communication; it is only by making this center visible that the effects of white privilege can be examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nakayama |first1=Thomas K. |last2=Krizek |first2=Robert L. |title=Whiteness: A strategic rhetoric. |journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech |date=August 1995 |volume=81 |issue=3 |pages=291–305 |doi=10.1080/00335639509384117 |issn=0033-5630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unjust enrichment===
[[Lawrence Blum]] refers to advantages for white people as "unjust enrichment" privileges, in which white people benefit from the injustices done to people of color, and he articulates that such privileges are deeply rooted in the U.S. culture and lifestyle:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When Blacks are denied access to desirable homes, for example, this is not just an injustice to Blacks but a positive benefit to Whites who now have a wider range of domicile options than they would have if Blacks had equal access to housing. When urban schools do a poor job of educating their Latino/a and Black students, this benefits Whites in the sense that it unjustly advantages them in the competition for higher levels of education and jobs. Whites in general cannot avoid benefiting from the historical legacy of racial discrimination and oppression. So unjust enrichment is almost never absent from the life situation of Whites.&lt;ref name="Privilege"/&gt;{{rp|311}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Spared injustice===
[[File:Boston Protester White Privilege.jpg|thumb|upright|A protester holds a sign reading "They don't shoot white women like me" at a Black Lives Matter protest in the wake of the non-indictment of a New York City police officer for the [[death of Eric Garner]]]]
In Blum's analysis of the underlying structure of white privilege, "spared injustice" is when a person of color suffers an unjust treatment while a white person does not. His example of this is when "a Black person is stopped by the police without due cause but a White person is not".&lt;ref name="Privilege"/&gt;{{rp|311–312}} He identifies "unjust enrichment" privileges as those for which whites are spared the injustice of a situation, and in turn, are benefiting from the injustice of others. For instance, "if police are too focused on looking for Black lawbreakers, they might be less vigilant toward White ones, conferring an unjust enrichment benefit on Whites who do break the laws but escape detection for this reason."&lt;ref name="Privilege"/&gt;{{rp|311–312}}

===Privileges not related to injustice===
Blum describes "non-injustice-related" privileges as those which are not associated with injustices experienced by people of color, but relate to a majority group's advantages over a minority group. Those who are in the majority, usually white people, gain "unearned privileges not founded on injustice."&lt;ref name="Privilege"/&gt;{{rp|311–312}} According to Blum, in workplace cultures there tends to be a partly ethnocultural character, so that some ethnic or racial groups' members find them more comfortable than do others.&lt;ref name="Privilege"/&gt;{{rp|311–312}}

===Framing racial inequality===
Dan J. Pence and J. Arthur Fields have observed resistance in the context of education to the idea that white privilege of this type exists, and suggest this resistance stems from a tendency to see inequality as a black or [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] issue. One report noted that white students often react to in-class discussions about white privilege with a continuum of behaviors ranging from outright hostility to a "wall of silence".&lt;ref name="Pence"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pence|first=Dan J.|author2=Fields, J.

Branscombe ''et al.'' demonstrate that framing racial inequality in terms of the privileges of whites increased levels of [[white guilt]] among white respondents. Those with high racial identification were more likely to give responses which concurred with modern [[racist]] attitudes than those with low racial identification.&lt;ref name="Branscombe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Branscombe|first=Nyla R.|author2=Schmitt, Michael T.|author3=Schiffhauer, Kristin|date=August 25, 2006|title=Racial Attitudes in Response to Thoughts of White Privilege|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|volume=37|issue=2|pages=203–15|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/112771384/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130106062349/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/112771384/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0|archive-date=January 6, 2013|access-date=July 19, 2008|doi=10.1002/ejsp.348}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the studies' authors, these findings suggest that representing inequality in terms of [[outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]] disadvantage allows privileged group members to avoid the negative implications of inequality.&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Powell|first=Adam A.|author2=Branscombe, Nyla R.|author3=Schmitt, Michael T.|year=2005|title=Inequality as Ingroup Privilege or Outgroup Disadvantage: The Impact of Group Focus on Collective Guilt and Interracial Attitudes|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=31|issue=4|pages=508–21|url=http://data.psych.udel.edu/abelcher/Shared%20Documents/6%20General%20Diversity%20Issues%20%2815%29/Powell.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522013408/http://data.psych.udel.edu/abelcher/Shared%20Documents/6%20General%20Diversity%20Issues%20%2815%29/Powell.pdf|archive-date=May 22, 2013|access-date=April 15, 2013|doi=10.1177/0146167204271713|pmid=15743985|s2cid=11601487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2019 study published in the ''[[Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|Journal of Experimental Psychology]]'' had socially liberal people read about white privilege, and then read about a poor person who was either black or white. They found that reading about white privilege did not increase empathy for either, and decreased it if the person was white. One of the study's authors said that this demonstrates the importance of nuance, and recognizing individual differences, when teaching about white privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jilani |first1=Zaid |title=What Happens When You Educate Liberals About White Privilege? |url=https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/what_happens_when_you_educate_liberals_about_white_privilege |access-date=June 4, 2019 |work=Greater Good |publisher=[[Greater Good Science Center]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cooley |first1=Erin |last2=Brown-Iannuzzi |first2=Jazmin L. |last3=Lei |first3=Ryan F. |last4=Cipolli |first4=William |title=Complex intersections of race and class: Among social liberals, learning about White privilege reduces sympathy, increases blame, and decreases external attributions for White people struggling with poverty. |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General |volume=148 |issue=12 |pages=2218–2228 |date=April 29, 2019 |doi=10.1037/xge0000605|pmid=31033321 |s2cid=139104272 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several scholars have raised questions about the focus on white privilege in efforts to combat racism in educational settings.

[[Robin DiAngelo]] coined the term "white fragility" in the early 2010s, later releasing her 2018 book ''[[White Fragility]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anna-kegler/the-sugarcoated-language-of-white-fragility_b_10909350.html|title=The Sugarcoated Language Of White Fragility {{!}} Huffington Post|last1=Feminist|first1=Anna Kegler|last2=writer|date=July 22, 2016|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=September 30, 2016|last3=Nerd|first3=Messaging}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has said that "white privilege can be thought of as unstable racial equilibrium",&lt;ref name="IJCP"/&gt; and that when this equilibrium is challenged, the resulting racial stress can become intolerable and trigger a range of defensive responses. DiAngelo defines these behaviors as white fragility. For example, DiAngelo observed in her studies that some white people, when confronted with racial issues concerning white privilege, may respond with dismissal, distress, or other defensive responses because they may feel personally implicated in white supremacy.&lt;ref name="Waldman18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lopez17"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lopez |first1=German |title=The Charlottesville protests are white fragility in action |url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/8/12/16138558/charlottesville-va-white-fragility |access-date=October 12, 2018 |work=Vox |date=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York Times reporter Amy Harmon has referred to ''white fragility'' as "the trademark inability of white Americans to meaningfully own their unearned privilege".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Harmon|first1=Amy |title=Prove You're Not White: For an Article About Race-Verification on Reddit, I Had an Unusual Request |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/reader-center/08insider-reddit-race-black-people-twitter-reporting.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DiAngelo also writes that white privilege is very rarely discussed and that even multicultural education courses tend to use vocabulary that further obfuscates racial privilege and defines race as something that only concerns blacks. She suggests using loaded terminology with negative connotations to people of color adds to the cycle of white privilege.
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is far more the norm for these courses and programs to use racially coded language such as 'urban,' 'inner city,' and 'disadvantaged' but to rarely use 'white' or 'overadvantaged' or 'privileged.' This racially coded language reproduces racist images and perspectives while it simultaneously reproduces the comfortable illusion that race and its problems are what 'they' have, not us.&lt;ref name="IJCP"&gt;{{cite journal|last=DiAngelo|first=Robin |title= White Fragility |journal= The International Journal of Critical Pedagogy |year= 2011 |pages= 54–70 |volume= 3 |issue= 3|url= https://libjournal.uncg.edu/index.php/ijcp/article/download/249/116 |access-date= March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
She does say, however, that defensiveness and discomfort from white people in response to being confronted with racial issues is not irrational but rather is often driven by subconscious, sometimes even well-meaning, attitudes toward racism.&lt;ref name="Waldman18"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Waldman |first1=Katy |title=A Sociologist Examines the "White Fragility" That Prevents White Americans from Confronting Racism |url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/a-sociologist-examines-the-white-fragility-that-prevents-white-americans-from-confronting-racism |access-date=October 12, 2018 |magazine=The New Yorker |date=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a book review, ''[[Washington Post]]'' critic Carlos Lozada said that the book presents self-fulfilling and oversimplified arguments, and "flattens people of any ancestry into two-dimensional beings fitting predetermined narratives".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lozada|first=Carlos|author-link=Carlos Lozada (journalist)|date=June 18, 2020 |title= White fragility is real.

===White backlash===
{{Main|White backlash}}

White backlash, the negative reaction of some [[white people]] to the advancement of non-whites, has been described as a possible response to the societal examination of white privilege, or to the perceived actual or hypothetical loss of that racial privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/24/george-yancy-dear-white-america-philosopher-confront-racism |title=Is white America ready to confront its racism? Philosopher George Yancy says we need a 'crisis' |last=Blasdel|first=Alex|date=April 24, 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/04/24/author-discusses-new-book-how-americans-respond-discussions-race |title=Backlash |last=Jaschik|first=Scott|date=April 24, 2018 |website=[[Inside Higher Ed]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 [[Valparaiso University School of Law|Valparaiso University]] journal article by [[DePaul University College of Law|DePaul University]] professor Terry Smith titled "White Backlash in a Brown Country" suggests that backlash results from threats to white privilege: "White backlash—the adverse reaction of whites to the progress of members of a non-dominant group—is symptomatic of a condition created by the gestalt of white privilege".&lt;ref name="whitebacklashbrowncountry2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Terry|title=Valparaiso University Law Review: White Backlash in a Brown Country |journal=Valparaiso University Law Review |year=2015|pages=89–132|volume=50|issue=1|url=http://scholar.valpo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2399&amp;context=vulr|quote=Most importantly, voter suppression abets an addiction to white privilege—which is the source of white backlash—by advancing the idea that the voters who are prevented from accessing the polls were less worthy to vote in the first place.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on political scientist [[Danielle Allen]]'s analysis that demographic shifts "provoke resistance from those whose well-being, status and self-esteem are connected to historical privileges of 'whiteness'",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trumps-troubling-us-constituency-2015-9 |title=Trump is tapping into a troubling US constituency |author-link=Danielle Allen|first=Danielle |last=Allen|date=September 7, 2015 |work=[[Business Insider]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith explored the interconnectivity of the concepts:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The hallmark of addiction is "protection of one's source." The same is true of backlash. The linear model of equality drastically underestimates the lengths to which people accustomed to certain privileges will go to protect them. It assigns to [[white Americans]] a preternatural ability to adapt to change and see their fellow citizens of color as equal.&lt;ref name="whitebacklashbrowncountry2015" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''Backlash: What Happens When We Talk Honestly about Racism in America'', philosopher [[George Yancy]] expands on the concept of white backlash as an extreme response to loss of privilege, suggesting that DiAngelo's [[#White fragility|white fragility]] is a subtle form of defensiveness in comparison to the visceral racism and threats of violence that Yancy has examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Backlash: What Happens When We Talk Honestly about Racism in America|first1=George |last1=Yancy|quote=The responses that I received, however, speak to something more extreme than just reactionary or unreceptive responses. Rather than "white fragility", these responses are ones that speak to deep forms of white world-making|date=2018|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|isbn=978-1-5381-0405-7|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global perspectives==
White privilege functions differently in different places. A person's white skin will not be an asset to them in every conceivable place or situation. White people are also a global minority, and this fact affects the experiences they have outside of their home areas. Nevertheless, some people who use the term "white privilege" describe it as a worldwide phenomenon, resulting from the history of colonialism by white Western Europeans. One author states that American white men are privileged almost everywhere in the world, even though many countries have never been colonized by Western Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Jacques|Jacques, Martin]] (September 19, 2003), "[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/sep/20/race.uk The global hierarchy of race: As the only racial group that never suffers systemic racism, whites are in denial about its impact]", ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Merryfield | first1 = Merry M. | year = 2000 | title = Why aren't teachers being prepared to teach for diversity, equity, and global interconnectedness?

In some accounts, global white privilege is related to [[American exceptionalism]] and [[American hegemony|hegemony]].&lt;ref&gt;Bush, Melanie E.

===Africa===
====Namibia====
The [[apartheid system]] in Namibia created the legal environment for establishing and maintaining white privilege. The segregation of peoples both preserved racial privileges and hindered unitary nation building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Namibia: Conquest to Independence: Formation of a Nation|author=Godfrey Mwakikagile|author-link=Godfrey Mwakikagile |date=2015|isbn=978-9987-16-044-0|publisher=New Africa Press|page=210|quote=The [[Apartheid]] system preserved white privilege in a divided society, segregated and invented divergent ethnic cultures and truncated the growth of a common [[national identity]]. Thus, Namibia lacked any facilitating conditions for unitary nation building}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the period of years during the negotiation of [[Namibian independence]], the country's administration, which was dominated by [[white Namibians]], held control of power. In a 1981 ''[[NYT]]'' analysis, [[Joseph Lelyveld]] reported how measures which would challenge white privilege in the country were disregarded, and how politicians, such as [[Dirk Mudge]], ignoring the policy of racial privilege, faced electoral threats from the [[black people|black]] majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/17/world/council-in-namibia-finds-whites-grip-still-strong.html |title=Council In Namibia Finds Whites' Grip Still Strong |author-link=Joseph Lelyveld|author=Joseph Lelyveld|quote=The new ministers find they can only make suggestions to the bureaucrats and the Administrator General and that when these suggestions touch on sensitive areas of white privilege, they tend to be shelved.|date=June 17, 1981|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, two years before the country's independence, [[Frene Ginwala]] suggested that there was a general refusal to acknowledge the oppression of [[black women]] in the country, by the [[white women]] who, according to Ginwala, had enjoyed the white privilege of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women Journalists in Namibia's Liberation Struggle, 1985-1990|author=Maria Mboono Nghidinwa |date=2008|isbn=978-3-905758-07-8|publisher=Basler Afrika Bibliographien|page=46|quote=She further argues that due to the "white privilege" that white women enjoyed during apartheid Namibia, these white women generally also refused to acknowledge the oppression of [[black women]] and have generally failed to question their own status ([[Frene Ginwala|Ginwala]], 1988).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research conducted by the [[Journal of Southern African Studies]] in 2008 has investigated how white privilege is generationally passed on, with particular focus on the descendants of [[German Namibians]], who arrived in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title='With Hard Work and Determination You Can Make It Here': Narratives of Identity among German Immigrants in Post-Colonial Namibia |author=Heidi Armbruster |date=2008|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|location=[[Journal of Southern African Studies]]|edition=Volume 34|pages=611–628|quote=However, integration is largely sought in the social and symbolic context defined as 'German' and 'white', and in dissociation from [[Namibia]] as 'Africa'. Silences, ambivalences, and contradictions at the narrative level reveal these generational cohorts to be slightly different, yet equally evasive about the problematic inheritance of white privilege.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the [[Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies]] further analyzed white privilege in post-colonial Namibia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title='Realising the Self and Developing the African': German Immigrants in Namibia |author=Heidi Armbruster |date=2010|publisher=[[Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies]]|edition=Volume 36|pages=1229–1246|quote=As Leonard (2010b) observes, since Western migrants in less developed countries enjoy certain privileges and status, the connotation of the word "expatriate" has evolved so that it now implies white privilege. For example, [[European immigrants]] still enjoy what they perceive to be favorable conditions in postcolonial Namibia, with many Namibians expressing gratitude for "the benefits of [[colonialism]]"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Africa====
[[File:Population registration certificate South Africa 1988.jpg|thumb|Registration certificate identifies a person as white]]
White privilege was legally enshrined in South Africa through [[apartheid]]. Apartheid was institutionalized in 1948 and lasted formally into the early 1990s. Under apartheid, racial privilege was not only socially meaningful—it became bureaucratically regulated. Laws such as the 1950 [[Population Registration Act, 1950|Population Registration Act]] established criteria to officially classify South Africans by race: White, Indian, Colored (mixed), or Black.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Posel, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/525576 "Race as Common Sense: Racial Classification in Twentieth-Century South Africa"], ''African Studies Review'' 44 (2), September 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars say that 'whiteness' still corresponds to a set of social advantages in South Africa, and conventionally refer to these advantages as "white privilege". The system of white privilege applies both to the way a person is treated by others and to a set of behaviors, affects, and thoughts, which can be learned and reinforced. These elements of "whiteness" establish social status and guarantee advantages for some people, without directly relying on skin color or other aspects of a person's appearance.&lt;ref name=Vice/&gt; White privilege in South Africa has small-scale effects, such as preferential treatment for people who appear white in public, and large-scale effects, such as the over five-fold difference in average per-capita income for people identified as white or black.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Sally (September 12, 2011), "[http://mg.co.za/article/2011-09-12-inherited-or-earned-advantage Inherited or earned advantage?]", ''Mail &amp; Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Afrikaner]] whiteness" has also been described as a partially subordinate identity, relative to the [[British Empire]] and [[Boerehaat]] (a type of prejudice towards Afrikaners), "disgraced" further by the end of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steyn | first1 = Melissa E. | year = 2004| title = Rehabilitating a whiteness disgraced: Afrikaner white talk in post-apartheid South Africa | journal = Communication Quarterly | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 143–169| doi = 10.1080/01463370409370187 | s2cid = 145673861 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fear that white South Africans suffer from "[[reverse racism]]" at the hands of the country's newly empowered majority,&lt;ref&gt;Vice, Samantha (September 2, 2011), "[http://mg.co.za/article/2011-09-02-why-my-opinions-on-whiteness-touched-a-nerve/ Why my opinions on whiteness touched a nerve]", ''Mail &amp; Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt; "Unfair" racial discrimination is prohibited by [[Section Nine of the Constitution of South Africa]], and this section also allows for laws to be made to address "unfair discrimination".

Academic [[Scott Kiesling]]'s co-edited ''The Handbook of Intercultural Discourse and Communication'' suggested that white English speakers are privileged in their ability to gain employment teaching English at [[Eikaiwa schools]] in Japan, regardless of [[Japanese language]] skills or professional qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Handbook of Intercultural Discourse and Communication|editor1=Paulston, Christina Bratt |editor2=Scott F.

"I think that was because I was [[white people|white]]" ... If I had been Korean, like I would've been treated as a guest. But not as a 'special' guest."

Professor Helene K.

The culture of US military [[United States Military and prostitution in South Korea#Kijich'on (Military Camptown)|camptowns]] in South Korea (a remnant of the [[Korean War]]) have been studied as a setting for white privilege, and an exacerbation of racial divides between white American and [[African American]] soldiers located on bases, as well as with local Korean people.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=[[Journal of Transnational American Studies]]|chapter=Black and Korean: Racialized Development and the Korean American Subject in Korean/American Fiction|date=2013|location=[[University of California, Santa Barbara]]|author=Lim, Jeehyun|publisher=[[California Digital Library]]|quote=Unduly burdened with social problems of [[United States Military and prostitution in South Korea|prostitution]] and violence in their function to contain the threats to the stability of the nation-states, camptowns, however, become optimal sites for [[race relations]] that are considered anomalous in the national spaces to unfold ...

Some scholars attribute white privilege, which they describe as informal [[Racism in the United States|racism]], to the formal racism (i.e. [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] followed by [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]]) that existed for much of American history.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Constraint of Race'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; In her book ''Privilege Revealed: How Invisible Preference Undermines America'', Stephanie M. Wildman writes that many Americans who advocate a merit-based, race-free worldview do not acknowledge the systems of privilege which have benefited them. For example, many Americans rely on a social or financial inheritance from previous generations, an inheritance unlikely to be forthcoming if one's ancestors were slaves.&lt;ref name="Wildman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wildman|first=Stephanie M.|author2=Armstrong, Margalynne|author3=Davis, Adrienne D.|author4=Grillo, Trina|title=Privilege Revealed: How Invisible Preference Undermines America|publisher=NYU Press|location=New York|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8147-9303-9|url=https://archive.org/details/privilegereveale00wild|url-access=registration|quote=Privilege Revealed: How Invisible Preference Undermines America.|access-date=July 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whites were sometimes afforded opportunities and benefits that were unavailable to others.

=====Wealth=====
According to Roderick Harrison "wealth is a measure of [[cumulative advantage]] or disadvantage" and "the fact that black and Hispanic wealth is a fraction of white wealth also reflects a history of discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/18/national/18wealth.html Study Says White Families' Wealth Advantage Has Grown]." ''The New York Times'' October 18, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Whites have historically had more opportunities to accumulate wealth.&lt;ref name="wealth"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Melvin L.|last1= Oliver|author2=Thomas M.

Over the past 40 years, there has been less formal [[discrimination in the United States|discrimination in America]]; the [[Racial wealth gap in the United States|inequality in wealth between racial groups]] however, is still extant.&lt;ref name=wealth/&gt; George Lipsitz asserts that because wealthy whites were able to pass along their wealth in the form of inheritances and transformative assets (inherited wealth which lifts a family beyond their own achievements), white Americans on average continually accrue advantages.&lt;ref name=possessive/&gt;{{rp|107–8}} Pre-existing disparities in wealth are exacerbated by tax policies that reward investment over waged income, subsidize mortgages, and subsidize private sector developers.&lt;ref name="Lipsitz"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lipsitz|first=George|author-link=George Lipsitz|date=September 1995|title=The Possessive Investment in Whiteness: Racialized Social Democracy and the "White" Problem in American Studies|journal=American Quarterly|volume=47|issue=3|pages=369–87|doi=10.2307/2713291|jstor=2713291|s2cid=147180034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Shapiro wrote that wealth is passed along from generation to generation, giving whites a better "starting point" in life than other races. According to Shapiro, many whites receive financial assistance from their parents allowing them to live beyond their income. This, in turn, enables them to buy houses and major assets which aid in the accumulation of wealth. Since houses in white neighborhoods appreciate faster, even African Americans who are able to overcome their "starting point" are unlikely to accumulate wealth as fast as whites. Shapiro asserts this is a continual cycle from which whites consistently benefit.&lt;ref name="Shapiro"&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas M. |last=Shapiro  |author-link=Thomas Shapiro |title=The Hidden Cost of Being African American; How Wealth Perpetuates Inequality |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-518138-8 |date=December 12, 2003 |url=https://archive.org/details/hiddencostofbein00shap }}&lt;/ref&gt; These benefits also have effects on schooling and other life opportunities.&lt;ref name=possessive/&gt;{{rp|32–3}}

=====Employment and economics=====

Royster compared black and white males who graduated from the same school with the same skills. In looking at their success with [[school-to-work transition]] and working experiences, she found that white graduates were more often employed in skilled trades, earned more, held higher status positions, received more promotions and experienced shorter periods of unemployment. Since all other factors were similar, the differences in employment experiences were attributed to race. Royster concluded that the primary cause of these racial differences was due to [[social networking]]. The concept of "who you know" seemed just as important to these graduates as "what you know".

According to the distinctiveness theory, posited by [[University of Kentucky]] professor Ajay Mehra and colleagues, people identify with other people who share similar characteristics which are otherwise rare in their environment; women identify more with women, whites with other whites. Because of this, Mehra finds that white males tend to be highly central in their social networks due to their numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Karsten|editor1-first=Margaret Foegen|title=Gender, Race, and Ethnicity in the Workplace: Organizational practices and individual strategies for women and minorities|date=2006|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn.

According to Royster, "these ideologies provide a contemporary deathblow to working-class black men's chances of establishing a foothold in the traditional trades."&lt;ref name="Royster" /&gt;

Other research shows that there is a correlation between a person's name and their likelihood of receiving a call back for a job interview.

[[Daniel A.

=====Housing=====
{{further|Racial inequality in the United States#Housing}}
[[Housing discrimination in the United States|Discrimination in housing policies]] was formalized in 1934 under the Federal Housing Act which provided government credit to private lending for home buyers.&lt;ref name=possessive/&gt;{{rp|5}} Within the Act, the Federal Housing Agency had the authority to channel all the money to white home buyers instead of minorities.&lt;ref name=possessive/&gt;{{rp|5}} The FHA also channeled money away from inner-city neighborhoods after World War II and instead placed it in the hands of white home buyers who would move into segregated suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Paula S. |last=Rothenberg |year=2005 |title=White Privilege |location=New York |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-0-7167-8733-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These, and other, practices intensified attitudes of segregation and inequality.

The "single greatest source of wealth" for white Americans is the growth in value in their owner-occupied homes. The family wealth so generated is the most important contribution to wealth disparity between black and white Americans.&lt;ref name="possessive"&gt;{{cite book|first=George |last=Lipsitz|author-link=George Lipsitz|title=The Possessive Investment in Whiteness: How White People Profit from Identity Politics, Revised and Expanded Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PIqUajTEfk0C|date=August 21, 2009|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-59213-495-3|pages=32–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32–33}}{{Dubious | Housing | reason = Poorly sourced.

Brown, Carnoey and Oppenheimer, in "Whitewashing Race: The Myth of a Color-Blind Society", write that the financial inequities created by discriminatory housing practices also have an ongoing effect on young black families, since the net worth of one's parents is the best predictor of one's own net worth, so discriminatory financial policies of the past contribute to race-correlated financial inequities of today.&lt;ref name="whitewashing"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Michael K.|last1= Brown|author2=Martin Carnoy|author3=David B.

=====Education=====
{{further|Racial achievement gap in the United States}}
According to Stephanie Wildman and Ruth Olson, education policies in the US have contributed to the construction and reinforcement of white privilege.&lt;ref&gt;Wildman, Stephanie M.

African Americans are disproportionately sent to [[special education]] classes in their schools, and identified as being disruptive or suffering from a learning disability. These students are segregated for the majority of the school day, taught by uncertified teachers, and do not receive high school diplomas. Wanda Blanchett has said that white students have consistently privileged interactions with the special education system, which provides 'non-normal' whites with the resources they need to benefit from the mainline white educational structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blanchett | first1 = Wanda J. | year = 2006| title = Disproportionate Representation of African American Students in Special Education: Acknowledging the Role of White Privilege and Racism | journal = Educational Researcher | volume = 35 | issue = 24| page = 2006 | doi = 10.3102/0013189X035006024 | s2cid = 145514632 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational inequality is also a consequence of housing. Since most states determine school funding based on property taxes,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} schools in wealthier neighborhoods receive more funding per student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=National Center for Education Statistics|title=The condition of education 2000|date=2000|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|location=Washington DC|page=102|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2000/2000062.pdf|access-date=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As home values in white neighborhoods are higher than minority neighborhoods,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} local schools receive more funding via property taxes.

In discussing unequal test scores between public school students, opinion columnist Matt Rosenberg laments the Seattle Public Schools' emphasis on "institutional racism" and "white privilege":
&lt;blockquote&gt;The disparity is not simply a matter of color: School District data indicate income, English-language proficiency and home stability are also important correlates to achievement&amp;nbsp;... By promoting the "white privilege" canard and by designing a student indoctrination plan, the Seattle School District is putting retrograde, leftist politics ahead of academics, while the perpetrators of "white privilege" are minimizing the capabilities of minorities.&lt;ref name="STRosen"&gt;Rosenberg, Matt (April 11, 2007), [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2003661182_matt11.html "Putting politics ahead of kids"], ''The Seattle Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Conservatism in the United States|Conservative]] author [[Shelby Steele]] believes that the effects of white privilege are exaggerated, saying that blacks may incorrectly blame their personal failures on white oppression, and that there are many "minority privileges": "If I'm a black high school student today&amp;nbsp;... there are white American institutions, universities, hovering over me to offer me opportunities: Almost every institution has a [[multiculturalism|diversity]] committee&amp;nbsp;...

[[Indigenous Australians]] were historically excluded from the process that lead to the [[federation of Australia]], and the [[White Australia policy]] restricted the freedoms for non-white people, particularly with respect to immigration. Indigenous people were governed by the [[Aborigines Protection Board]] and treated as a separate underclass of non-citizens.&lt;ref name="Perera2005"&gt;Suvendrini Perera, "[http://www.acrawsa.org.au/files/ejournalfiles/98SuvendriniPerera.pdf Who Will I Become?

Some scholars{{who|date=February 2016}} claim white people are seen presumptively as "Australian", and as prototypical citizens.&lt;ref name=Lobo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ganley/&gt; Catherine Koerner has claimed that a major part of white Australian privilege is the ability to be in Australia itself, and that this is reinforced by, discourses on non-white outsiders including [[asylum seekers]] and [[Illegal immigration|undocumented immigrants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koerner | first1 = Catherine | title = Whose Security?

Some scholars{{who|date=February 2016}} have suggested that public displays of [[multiculturalism]], such as the celebration of artwork and stories of [[Indigenous Australians]], amount to [[tokenism]], since indigenous Australians voices are largely excluded from the cultural [[Australian history wars|discourse]] surrounding the history of colonialism and the narrative of European colonizers as peaceful settlers. These scholars{{who|date=February 2016}} suggest that white privilege in Australia, like white privilege elsewhere, involves the ability to define the limits of what can be included in a "multicultural" society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Larbalestier|first=Jan|title=White Over Black: Discourses of Whiteness in Australian Culture|url=http://www.borderlands.net.au/vol3no2_2004/larbalestier_white.htm|work=Borderlands e-Journal|access-date=November 9, 2012|archive-date=June 16, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616062149/http://www.borderlands.net.au/vol3no2_2004/larbalestier_white.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deirdre Howard-Wagner, "'[https://tasa.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Howard-Wagner.pdf Practices of Inclusiveness' in Newcastle: protocols of whiteness, Indigenous protocols and power relations]", TASA Conference, December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maryrose Casey, "[http://www.acrawsa.org.au/files/ejournalfiles/177CRWS201281Casey.pdf Colonisation, Notions of Authenticity and Aboriginal Australian Performance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409210111/http://acrawsa.org.au/files/ejournalfiles/177CRWS201281Casey.pdf |date=April 9, 2013 }}", ''Critical Race and Whiteness Studies'' [http://www.acrawsa.org.au/ejournal/?id=54 8] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409210015/http://acrawsa.org.au/ejournal/?id=54 |date=April 9, 2013 }}, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous studies in Australian universities remains largely controlled by white people, hires many white professors, and does not always embrace political changes that benefit indigenous people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fredericks | first1 = Brownwyn | title = The Epistemology That Maintains White Race Privilege, Power and Control of Indigenous Studies and Indigenous Peoples' Participation in Universities | url = http://www.acrawsa.org.au/files/ejournalfiles/45acrawsa518.pdf | journal = ACRAWSA e-Journal | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | year = 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130410062923/http://acrawsa.org.au/files/ejournalfiles/45acrawsa518.pdf | archive-date = April 10, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lampert | first1 = Jo | title = The Alabaster Academy: Being a Non-Indigenous Academic in Indigenous Studies | url = http://eprints.qut.edu.au/6253/1/6253.pdf| journal = Social Alternatives | volume = 22 | issue = 3| year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hart2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = Victor | title = Teaching Black and Teaching Back | url = http://www.geocities.ws/parentsaspartners/teachingblack.pdf| journal = Social Alternatives | volume = 22 | issue = 3| year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gunstone | first1 = Andrew | title = Whites, Indigenous People, and Australian Universities | url = http://www.acrawsa.org.au/files/ejournalfiles/44acrawsa517.pdf | journal = ACRAWSA e-Journal | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | year = 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150228013434/http://acrawsa.org.au/files/ejournalfiles/44acrawsa517.pdf | archive-date = February 28, 2015 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars also say that prevailing modes of Western epistemology and pedagogy, associated with the [[dominant culture|dominant white culture]], are treated as universal while Indigenous perspectives are excluded or treated only as objects of study.&lt;ref name=Hart2003/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lester-Irabinna Rigney, "[https://ncis.anu.edu.au/_lib/doc/LI_Rigney_First_perspective.pdf A first perspective of Indigenous Australian participation in science : framing Indigenous research towards Indigenous Australian intellectual sovereignty]", ''Kaurna Higher Education Journal'' 7, August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Aileen Moreton-Robinson|Moreton-Robinson, Aileen]] (2004), "Whiteness, epistemology, and indigenous representation", in ''Whitening Race: Essays In Social And Cultural Criticism'', ed.

Some scholars{{who|date=February 2016}} have claimed that for Australian whites, another aspect of privilege is the ability to identify with a global diaspora of other white people in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere. This privilege contrasts with the separation of Indigenous Australians from other indigenous peoples in southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=Perera2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randell-Moon, Holly, "[http://www.acrawsa.org.au/files/ejournalfiles/editorials/54CRWSRandell-Moon2012.pdf Racial Legitimations and the Unbearable Whiteness of Being] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409210109/http://acrawsa.org.au/files/ejournalfiles/editorials/54CRWSRandell-Moon2012.pdf |date=April 9, 2013 }}", ''Critical Race and Whiteness Studies'' [http://www.acrawsa.org.au/ejournal/?id=54 8] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409210015/http://acrawsa.org.au/ejournal/?id=54 |date=April 9, 2013 }}, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; They also claim that global political issues such as climate change are framed in terms of white actors and effects on countries that are predominantly white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jensen | first1 = Lars | title = The whiteness of climate change | url = http://www.ub.edu/dpfilsa/jeasa22jensen9.pdf | journal = Journal of the European Association of Studies on Australia | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | year = 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131103072740/http://www.ub.edu/dpfilsa/jeasa22jensen9.pdf | archive-date = November 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

White privilege varies across places and situations. Ray Minniecon, director of Crossroads Aboriginal Ministries, described the city of [[Sydney]] specifically as "the most alien and inhospitable place of all to Aboriginal culture and people".&lt;ref&gt;Minniecon, Ray (February 17, 2004), "[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/02/16/1076779903465.html Despair the reality for a race lost in the alien space of Redfern]", ''Sydney Morning Herald''; quoted by Suvendrini Perera, "[http://www.acrawsa.org.au/files/ejournalfiles/64SuvendriniPerera.pdf 'Aussie Luck': the Border Politics of Citizenship Post Cronulla Beach] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410063014/http://acrawsa.org.au/files/ejournalfiles/64SuvendriniPerera.pdf |date=April 10, 2013 }}", ''ACRAWSA e-journal'' [http://www.acrawsa.org.au/ejournal/?id=23 3(1)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409210028/http://acrawsa.org.au/ejournal/?id=23 |date=April 9, 2013 }}, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; At the other end of the spectrum, anti-racist white Australians working with Indigenous people may experience their privilege as painful "stigma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kowal|first=Emma|author-link=Emma Kowal|journal=Cultural Studies|date=May 1, 2011|volume=25|issue=3|pages=313–333|doi=10.1080/09502386.2010.491159|title=The Stigma of White Privilege|s2cid=142845038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of white privilege in Australia have increased since the late 1990s, with several books published on the history of how whiteness became a dominant identity.

{{See also|Structural discrimination in New Zealand}}
In New Zealand, a localized relationship to the concept, frequently termed Pākehā privilege,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11794425 |title=Why the Treaty of Waitangi matters|date=February 4, 2017 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the legacy of the colonizing [[European settlers in New Zealand|European settlers]], has developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Max|last= Harris|quote= In South Africa and the US, among other places, there is an increasing literature on whiteness and white privilege.

Academic [[Huia Jahnke]]'s book ''Mana Tangata: Politics of Empowerment'' explored how [[European New Zealanders]], in rejecting the 'one people' national narrative and embracing the label [[Pākehā]] ("foreigner"), has allowed space to examine white privilege and the societal marginalization of [[Māori people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Bronwyn |last=Campbell|editor1=Huia Tomlins-Jahnke|editor2=Malcolm Mulholland|quote=Pākehā naming themselves as 'other' also demonstrates a willingness to challenge both Pākehā privilege and Maori marginalisation (Spoonley 1995a; Bell 1996).|title=Mana Tangata: Politics of Empowerment|date=2013|publisher=[[Huia Publishers]]|isbn=978-1-77550-021-6|chapter=Te Tiriti o Waitangi: A Blueprint for the Future}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Massey University]] scholar Malcolm Mulholland argued that "studying inequalities between Māori and non-Māori outcomes allows us to identify Pākehā privilege and name it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=State of the Māori Nation: Twenty-first Century Issues in Aotearoa|first=Malcolm |last=Mulholland|date=2006|publisher=[[Reed Publishing]]|isbn=978-0-7900-1042-7|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their book ''Healing Our History'', Robert and Joanna Consedine argued that in the colonial era Pākehā privilege was enforced in school classrooms by strict time periods, European symbols, and the exclusion of [[te reo]] (the Māori language), disadvantaging Māori children and contributing to the suppression of Māori culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Consedine |first1=Robert |title=Healing Our History: The Challenge of the Treaty of Waitangi |author2=Joanna Consedine |date=2012 |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=978-0-14-356769-1 |page=123 |quote=In colonial times a range of mechanisms were used in schools to reinforce Pākehā privilege and values, including rigid time periods, European symbols around the room, and the exclusion of Maori language.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
