'''White privilege''' (or '''white skin privilege''') is the [[Social privilege|societal privilege]] that benefits [[white people]] over [[non-white]] people, particularly if they are otherwise under the same social, political, or economic circumstances. With roots in [[European colonialism]],&lt;ref name="jamesstephens1824" /&gt; the spread of the [[British Empire]], and the enactment of the [[Atlantic slave trade]], white privilege has developed over centuries,&lt;ref name="colonialismandbeyond2013" /&gt; in circumstances that have broadly sought to protect white racial privileges,&lt;ref name="modernpolitical2003" /&gt; various national citizenships and other rights or special benefits.&lt;ref name="racialprofiling2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="livingracism2017" /&gt;

In the [[study of white privilege]], and its broader field of [[whiteness studies]], academic perspectives such as [[critical race theory]] use the concept to analyze how [[racism]] and [[racialized society|racialized societies]] affect the lives of white or white-skinned people. For example, [[Peggy McIntosh]] describes the advantages that whites in Western societies enjoy and non-whites do not experience, as "an invisible package of unearned assets".&lt;ref name="Unpacking"/&gt; White privilege denotes both obvious and less obvious passive advantages that white people may not recognize they have, which distinguishes it from overt bias or prejudice. These include cultural affirmations of one's own worth; presumed greater social status; and [[freedom to move]], buy, work, play, and [[speak freely]]. The effects can be seen in professional, educational, and personal contexts. The concept of white privilege also implies the right to assume the universality of one's own experiences, marking others as different or exceptional while perceiving oneself as [[Normality (behavior)|normal]].&lt;ref name="Vice"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vice |first=Samantha |title=How Do I Live in This Strange Place? |journal=Journal of Social Philosophy |date=September 7, 2010 |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=323–342 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9833.2010.01496.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin-McDonald |first=K |author2=McCarthy, A |title='Marking' the white terrain in indigenous health research: literature review. |journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing |date=January 2008 |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=126–33 |pmid=18186904 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2648.2007.04438.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars say that the term uses the concept of "whiteness" as a proxy for [[Social class|class]] or other social privilege or as a distraction from deeper underlying problems of inequality.&lt;ref name="Arnesen"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eric |last=Arnesen |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?aid=92975&amp;fileId=S0147547901004380 |title=Whiteness and the Historians' Imagination |journal=International Labor and Working-Class History |volume=60 |date=October 2001 |pages=3–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hartigan, 2005 pp. 1"&gt;Hartigan, ''Odd Tribes'' (2005), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Others state that it is not that whiteness is a proxy but that many other social privileges are interconnected with it, requiring complex and careful analysis to identify how whiteness contributes to privilege.&lt;ref name="Privilege"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blum | first1 = Lawrence | year = 2008 | title = 'White Privilege': A Mild Critique1 | url = | journal = Theory and Research in Education | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 309–321 | doi = 10.1177/1477878508095586 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators propose alternative definitions of whiteness and exceptions to or limits of white identity, arguing that the concept of white privilege ignores important differences between white [[Statistical population|subpopulations]] and individuals and suggesting that the notion of whiteness cannot be inclusive of all white people.&lt;ref name="uws.edu.au"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Forrest |first1=James |last2=Dunn |first2=Kevin |title='Core' Culture Hegemony and Multiculturalism |journal=Ethnicities |date=June 2006 |volume=6 |number=2 |doi=10.1177/1468796806063753 |url=http://www.uws.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/29645/A23.pdf |pages=203–230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blum 309–321"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blum |first=L. |title='White privilege': A Mild Critique |journal=[[Theory and Research in Education]] |date=November 1, 2008 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=309–321 |doi=10.1177/1477878508095586 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They note the problem of acknowledging the diversity of people of color and ethnicity within these groups.&lt;ref name="Privilege"/&gt;

Writers have noted that the "academic-sounding concept of white privilege" sometimes elicits defensiveness and misunderstanding among white people, in part due to how the concept of white privilege was rapidly brought into the mainstream spotlight through [[social media]] campaigns such as [[Black Lives Matter]].&lt;ref name="brydum"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brydum |first1=Sunnivie |title=The Year in Hashtags: 2014 |url=http://www.advocate.com/year-review/2014/12/31/year-hashtags |accessdate=January 23, 2016 |agency=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |date=December 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As an academic concept that was only recently brought into the mainstream, the concept of white privilege is frequently misinterpreted by non-academics; some academics, having studied white privilege undisturbed for decades, have been surprised by the seemingly-sudden hostility from [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] critics since approximately 2014.&lt;ref name="weinburg"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Weinburg |first1=Cory |title=The White Privilege Moment |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/05/28/academics-who-study-white-privilege-experience-attention-and-criticism |accessdate=January 19, 2016 |agency=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=May 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Although the definition of "white privilege" has been somewhat fluid, it is generally agreed to refer to the implicit or systemic advantages that white people have relative to people who are the objects of racism; it is the ''absence'' of suspicion and other negative reactions that people who are objects of racism experience.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, H., Worthington, R., Spanierman, L. (2001). Race, Power, and Multicultural Counseling Psychology: Understanding White Privilege and Color Blind Racial Attitudes. In Ponterotto, J., Casas, M, Suzuki, L, and Alexander, C. (Eds) Handbook of Multicultural Counseling, Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is used in discussions focused on the mostly hidden benefits that white people possess in a society where racism is prevalent and whiteness is considered normal, rather than on the detriments to people who are the objects of racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |year=2000 |last1=Pulido |first1=L. |doi=10.1111/0004-5608.00182 |title=Rethinking Environmental Racism: White Privilege and Urban Development in Southern California |journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers |volume=90 |page=15|hdl=10214/1833 |url=https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/bitstream/10214/1833/1/30-Pulido.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Andersen |first1=Chris |title=Critical Indigenous Studies in the Classroom: Exploring 'the Local' using Primary Evidence |journal=International Journal of Critical Indigenous Studies |date=2012 |volume=5 |issue=1 |url=http://www.isrn.qut.edu.au/publications/internationaljournal/documents/Final_Anderson_IJCIS.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, most definitions and discussions of the concept use as a starting point McIntosh's metaphor of the "invisible backpack" that white people unconsciously "wear" in a society where racism is prevalent.&lt;ref name="Marcus2017"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Marcus |first1=David |title=A Conservative Defense of Privilege Theory |url=https://www.weeklystandard.com/david-marcus/a-conservative-defense-of-privilege-theory |work=The Weekly Standard |date=6 November 2017 |language=en |quote=First described by Peggy McIntosh in the late 1980s, white privilege basically describes somewhat hidden advantages that white people in our society enjoy, that they did not earn.

In historian [[William Miller Macmillan]]'s 1929 ''The Frontier and the Kaffir Wars, 1792-1836'', he describes the motivations of [[Afrikaner]] settlers to embark upon the [[Great Trek]] as an attempt to preserve their racial privilege over indigenous [[Khoisan]] people; "It was primarily land hunger and a determination to uphold white privilege that drove the Trekkers out of the colony in their hundreds". [[Cape Colony]] was administered by the [[British Empire]] and their increasingly anti-slavery policies were seen as a threat by the Dutch-speaking settlers, who were afraid of losing their African and Asian slaves, as well as their superior status as people of European descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge history of the British Empire|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.508933|author1=William Miller Macmillan|authorlink1=William Miller Macmillan|editor1=John Holland Rose|editor2=Arthur Percival Newton|editor3=Ernest Alfred Benians|editor4=Henry Dodwell|quote=|date=1929|publisher=[[The Macmillan company]]|location=|isbn=|page=322|edition=Volume 8|chapter=The Frontier and the Kaffir Wars, 1792-1836}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, ''Zaire Church News'', a missionary publication in the [[Zaire]] area, confronted white privilege's impact from the [[European colonization]] of central and southern Africa, and its impact on [[black people]]'s progress in the region:

Scholar [[João Ferreira Duarte]], in his jointedly written ''Europe in Black and White'', has examined colonialism in relation to white privilege, suggesting its legacy continues "to imprint the privilege of whiteness onto the new map of Europe", but also "sustain the political fortification of Europe as a hegemonic white space."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Europe in Black and White: Immigration, Race, and Identity in the ‘Old Continent'|editor1=Manuela Ribeiro Sanches|editor2=Fernando Clara|editor3=[[João Ferreira Duarte]]|editor4=Leonor Pires Martins|quote=|date=2011|publisher=IntellectBooks|location=|isbn=978-1841503578|page=125|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 20th-century===
An address on ''Social Equities'', from a 1910 [[National Council of the Congregational Churches of the United States]] publication, demonstrates some of the earliest terminology developing in the concept of white skin privilege:
&lt;blockquote&gt;What infinite cruelties and injustices have been practiced by men who believed that to have a white skin constituted special privilege and who reckoned along with the divine rights of kings the divine rights of the white! We are all glad to take up the [[white man's burden]] if that burden carries with it the privilege of asserting the [[white supremacy|white man's superiority]], of exploiting the man of lesser breed, and making him know and keep his place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Council Fourteenth Triennial Session Addresses and Discussions|chapter=Social Equities|author1=George Luther Cady|date=1910|publisher=[[National Council of the Congregational Churches of the United States]]|location=[[Boston, Massachusetts]]|edition=October 10–20, Fourteenth Triennial Session|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his 1935 ''[[Black Reconstruction|Black Reconstruction in America]]'', [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] introduced the concept of a "psychological wage" for white laborers. This special status, he wrote, divided the labor movement by leading low-wage white workers to feel superior to low-wage black workers.&lt;ref name=DuBois/&gt; Du Bois identified [[white supremacy]] as a global phenomenon, affecting the social conditions across the world by means of colonialism.&lt;ref name="Leonardo"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leonardo | first1 = Zeus | year = 2010| title = The Souls of White Folk: critical pedagogy, whiteness studies, and globalization discourse | journal = Race Ethnicity and Education | volume = 5 | issue = 1| page = 2002 | doi = 10.1080/13613320120117180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, Du Bois wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It must be remembered that the white group of laborers, while they received a low wage, were compensated in part by a sort of public and psychological wage. They were given public deference and titles of courtesy because they were white. They were admitted freely with all classes of white people to public functions, public parks, and the best schools. The police were drawn from their ranks, and the courts, dependent on their votes, treated them with such leniency as to encourage lawlessness. Their vote selected public officials, and while this had small effect upon the economic situation, it had great effect upon their personal treatment and the deference shown them. White schoolhouses were the best in the community, and conspicuously placed, and they cost anywhere from twice to ten times as much per capita as the colored schools. The newspapers specialized on news that flattered the poor whites and almost utterly ignored the Negro except in crime and ridicule.&lt;ref name="DuBois"&gt;W. E. B. Du Bois, ''Black Reconstruction in America, 1860–1880'' (New York: Free Press, 1995 reissue of 1935 original), pp. 700–701. {{ISBN|0-684-85657-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 1942 edition of ''[[Modern Review (Calcutta)|Modern Review]]'' magazine, [[Ramananda Chatterjee]] accused [[Winston Churchill]] of [[hypocritical]] policy positions, in his support, as Chatterjee viewed it, of racial equality in the UK and US but not in [[British India]]; "Mr Churchill can support white privilege and monopoly in India whilst opposing privilege and monopoly on both sides of the Atlantic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Modern Review|author1=Ramananda Chatterjee|authorlink1=Ramananda Chatterjee|author2=|edition=Volume 71|date=1942|work=[[Modern Review (Calcutta)|Modern Review]]|location=|isbn=|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, during [[World War II]], sociologist [[Alfred McClung Lee]]'s ''Race Riot, Detroit 1943'' addressed the "Nazi-like guarantee of white privilege" in American society:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[White Americans]] might well ask themselves: Why do whites ''need'' so many special advantages in their competition with Negroes? Similar tactics for the elimination of Jewish competition in [[Nazi Germany]] brought the shocked condemnation of the civilized world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Race riot, Detroit 1943|author1=Alfred McClung Lee|authorlink1=Alfred McClung Lee|author2=Norman Daymond Humphrey|quote=|date=1943|publisher=The Dryden Press|location=[[University of Michigan]]|isbn=|page=139|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===US civil rights movement===
:{{Main|US civil rights movement}}
In the United States, inspired by the [[civil rights movement]], [[Theodore W. Allen]] began a 40-year analysis of "white skin privilege", "white race" privilege, and "white" privilege in a call he drafted for a "John Brown Commemoration Committee" that urged "White Americans who want government of the people" and "by the people" to "begin by first repudiating their white skin privileges".&lt;ref&gt;Theodore W. Allen, "A Call . . . John Brown Memorial Pilgrimage . . . December 4, 1965," John Brown Commemoration Committee, 1965 and Jeffrey B. Perry, [http://clogic.eserver.org/2010/2010.html "The Developing Conjuncture and Some Insights from Hubert Harrison and Theodore W.

It focused on the struggle against "white skin privilege" and significantly influenced the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) and sectors of the [[New Left]]. By June 15, 1969, the ''New York Times'' was reporting that the National Office of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) was calling "for an all-out fight against 'white skin privileges'".&lt;ref&gt;See Noel Ignatin (Ignatiev) and Ted (Theodore W.) Allen, [http://www.sds-1960s.org/WhiteBlindspot.pdf "'White Blindspot' and 'Can White Workers Radicals Be Radicalized?'"] (Detroit: The Radical Education Project and New York: NYC Revolutionary Youth Movement, 1969); Thomas R.

Allen. . . "&lt;/ref&gt; From 1974 to 1975, Allen extended his analysis to the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial]] period, leading to the publication of "Class Struggle and the Origin of Racial Slavery: The Invention of the White Race,"&lt;ref&gt;Theodore W. Allen, [http://clogic.eserver.org/2006/allen.html Class Struggle and the Origin of Racial Slavery: The Invention of the White Race] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406121446/http://clogic.eserver.org/2006/allen.html |date=April 6, 2011 }} (Hoboken: Hoboken Education Project, 1975), republished in 2006 with an "Introduction" by Jeffrey B. Perry at Center for the Study of Working Class Life, SUNY, Stony Brook.&lt;/ref&gt; (1975) which ultimately grew into his two-volume "The Invention of the White Race" in 1994 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore W. Allen, The Invention of the White Race, Vol. I: Racial Oppression and Social Control (New York: Verso, 1994, 2012 {{ISBN|978-1-84467-769-6}}) and Vol. II: The Origin of Racial Oppression in Anglo-America (New York: Verso, 1997, 2012 {{ISBN|978-1-84467-770-2}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work, Allen maintained several points: that the "white race" was invented as a ruling class [[social control]] formation in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century Anglo-American plantation colonies (principally Virginia and Maryland); that central to this process was the ruling-class plantation bourgeoisie conferring "white race" privileges on European-American working people; that these privileges were not only against the interests of African-Americans, they were also "poison," "ruinous," a baited hook, to the class interests of working people; that white supremacy, reinforced by the "white skin privilege," has been as the main retardant of working-class consciousness in the US; and that struggle for radical social change should direct principal efforts at challenging white supremacy and "white skin privileges".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey B.

In newspapers and public discourse across the United States in the 1960s, the term "white privilege" was often used to describe white areas under conditions of [[residential segregation]]. These and other uses grew out of the era of [[Racial segregation in the United States|legal discrimination]] against Black Americans, and reflected the idea that white status could continue despite formal equality.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} In the 1990s, the term came back into public discourse, such as in [[Robert W. Jensen|Robert Jensen]]'s 1998 opinion piece in the [[The Baltimore Sun|''Baltimore Sun'']], titled "White privilege shapes the U.S."&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;Jensen, Robert, [http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~rjensen/freelance/whiteprivilege.htm "White privilege shapes the U.S."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612133025/http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~rjensen/freelance/whiteprivilege.htm |date=June 12, 2011 }} ''Baltimore Sun'', July 19, 1998, p.C-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Study of the concept===
:{{Main|Study of white privilege}}
The concept of white privilege also came to be used within radical circles for purposes of self-criticism by [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] whites. For instance, a 1975 article in ''[[Lesbian Tide]]'' criticized the American feminist movement for exhibiting "class privilege" and "white privilege".  [[Weather Underground]] leader [[Bernardine Dohrn]], in a 1977 ''Lesbian Tide'' article, wrote: "... by assuming that I was beyond white privilege or allying with male privilege because I understood it, I prepared and led the way for a totally opportunist direction which infected all of our work and betrayed revolutionary principles."&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;Jacob Bennett, "White Privilege: A History of the Concept", Master’s Thesis at Georgia State University, May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, the term gained new popularity in academic circles and public discourse after [[Peggy McIntosh]]'s 1987 essay [[Peggy McIntosh#Invisible knapsack|''White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack'']].&lt;ref name="newyorker"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rothman|first=Joshua|title=The Origins of "Privilege"|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2014/05/the-woman-who-coined-the-term-white-privilege.html|accessdate=May 14, 2014|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this essay, McIntosh described white privilege as “an invisible weightless knapsack of assurances, tools, maps, guides, codebooks, passports, visas, clothes, compass, emergency gear, and blank checks," and also discussed the relationships between different social hierarchies in which experiencing oppression in one hierarchy did not negate unearned privilege experienced in another.&lt;ref name="Unpacking"&gt;{{cite web|first1=Peggy|last1=McIntosh|title=White privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack|url=http://people.westminstercollege.edu/faculty/jsibbett/readings/White_Privilege.pdf}} Independent School, Winter90, Vol. 49 Issue 2, p31, 5p&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McIntosh, Peggy.

In 2003, Ella Bell and Stella Nkomo noted that "most scholars of race relations embrace the use of [the concept] white privilege".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ella L.

===21st-century popular culture===
White privilege as a concept marked its transition from academia to more mainstream prominence through [[social media]] in the early 2010s, especially in 2014, a year in which [[Black Lives Matter]] formed into a major movement and the word "hashtag" itself was added to [[Merriam-Webster]].&lt;ref name="brydum"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brydum |first1=Sunnivie |title=The Year in Hashtags: 2014 |url=http://www.advocate.com/year-review/2014/12/31/year-hashtags |accessdate=January 23, 2016 |agency=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |date=December 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brandt and Kizer, in their article "From Street to Tweet" (2015), discuss the American public's perception of the concept of privilege in mainstream culture, including white privilege, as being influenced by social media.&lt;ref name="brandt-kizer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brandt|first1=Jenn|last2=Kizer|first2=Sam|title=From Street to Tweet: Popular Culture and Feminist Activism|publisher=SensePublishers|isbn=978-94-6300-061-1|pages=115–127|doi=10.1007/978-94-6300-061-1_9|chapter=From Street to Tweet|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hua Hsu]], a [[Vassar College]] professor of English, opened his ''[[The New Yorker]]'' review of the 2015 [[MTV]] film [[White People (film)|''White People'']] with the remark: "like the robot in a movie slowly discovering that it is, indeed, a robot, it feels as though we are living in the moment when white people, on a generational scale, have become self-aware".&lt;ref name="huahsu-ny"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hsu|first1=Hua|title=The Trouble with "White People"|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-trouble-with-white-people|accessdate=February 15, 2016|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that "white people have begun to understand themselves in the explicit terms of identity politics, long the province of those on the margins", Hsu ascribes this change in self-awareness to a generational change, "one of strange byproducts of the [[Barack Obama|Obama]] era". Hsu writes that discourse on the nature of whiteness "isn't a new discussion, by any means, but it has never seemed quite so animated".&lt;ref name="huahsu-ny" /&gt;

The film ''White People'' itself, produced and directed by [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner [[Jose Antonio Vargas]], is a documentary that follows a variety of white teenagers who express their honest thoughts and feelings about their whiteness on-camera, as well as their opinions on white privilege. During one moment of the film, Vargas interviews a white community college student, Katy, who attributes her inability to land a college scholarship to [[reverse racism]] against white people, before Vargas points out that white students are "40 percent more likely to receive merit-based funding".&lt;ref name="amyzimmerman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zimmeman|first1=Amy|title='White People': MTV Takes On White Privilege|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/20/white-people-mtv-takes-on-white-privilege.html|accessdate=February 16, 2016|agency=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one review of the film, a ''[[The Daily Beast|Daily Beast]]'' writer interviews Ronnie Cho, the head of MTV Public Affairs, who acknowledges "young people as the engine behind social change and awareness", and therefore would be more likely to talk about white privilege, but also notes that at the same time, [[millennials]] (with some overlap with [[Generation Z]]) form "a generation that maybe were raised with noble aspirations to be color blind". Ronnie Cho then asserts these aspirations "may not be very helpful if we ignore difference. The color of our skin does matter, and impacts how the world interacts with us." Later in the same review, writer Amy Zimmerman notes that, "white people often don't feel a pressing need to talk about race, because they don't experience it as racism and oppression, and therefore hardly experience it at all. [[Check your privilege|Checking privilege]] is an act of self-policing for white Americans; comparatively, black Americans are routinely over-checked by the literal police."&lt;ref name="amyzimmerman" /&gt;

In January 2016, hip-hop group [[Macklemore and Ryan Lewis]] released "[[White Privilege II]]", a single from their album ''[[This Unruly Mess I've Made]]'', in which [[Macklemore]] raps about his struggle to find his place in the Black Lives Matter protest movement, conscious that his commercial success in [[hip hop]] is at least partially a product of white privilege, and his criticism of defensive responses to white privilege. He also says that other white performers have profited immensely from [[cultural appropriation]] of black culture, such as [[Iggy Azalea]]&lt;ref name="jagannathan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jagannathan|first1=Meera|title=Macklemore slams Miley Cyrus, Iggy Azalea for appropriating black culture, tackles racism and Black Lives Matter in new track 'White Privilege II'|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/macklemore-slams-miley-iggy-azalea-white-privilege-ii-article-1.2505788|accessdate=January 23, 2016|agency=[[New York Daily News]]|date=January 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Forrest Wickman, writing for [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']], observes that the line supposedly accusing Azalea of "heisting the magic," is really a self-criticism: [[The Heist (album)|''The Heist'']] was Macklemore and Ryan Lewis' debut album.&lt;ref name=wickman&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wickman|first1=Forrest|title=Macklemore's "White Privilege II" Isn't a Great Song, But as a Think Piece It's Not Terrible|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2016/01/22/macklemore_s_white_privilege_ii_isn_t_a_great_song_but_as_a_lyrical_think.html|accessdate=23 January 2016|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=January 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wickman states that "White Privilege II" is not "a great song, but as a think piece it's not terrible" and praises Macklemore for "giving Black Lives Matter protesters (along with up-and-coming singer Jamila Woods) the last word."&lt;ref name=wickman /&gt; Spencer Kornhaber, a reviewer for ''[[The Atlantic]]'', calls the song "brave" and "both a statement...and a demonstration" and writes that Macklemore "spotlights the voices of actual black activists".

According to Fredrik deBoer, it is a popular trend for white people to willingly claim self-acknowledgement of their white privilege online. deBoer criticized this practice as promoting self-regard and not solving any actual inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=deBoer|first1=Fredrik|title=Admitting that white privilege helps you is really just congratulating yourself|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/01/28/when-white-people-admit-white-privilege-theyre-really-just-congratulating-themselves/|accessdate=February 14, 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=January 28, 2016|ref=deboer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael J.

==Applications in critical theory==

===Critical race theory===
:{{Main|Critical race theory}}

The concept of white privilege has been studied by theorists of [[whiteness studies]] seeking to examine the construction and moral implications of 'whiteness'. There is often overlap between critical whiteness and race theories, as demonstrated by focus on the legal and historical construction of white identity, and the use of narratives (whether legal discourse, testimony or fiction) as a tool for exposing systems of racial power.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Haney López, Ian F. ''White by Law''. 1995; Lipsitz, George. ''Possessive Investment in Whiteness''; Delgado, Richard; Williams, Patricia; and Kovel, Joel.&lt;/ref&gt; Fields such as History and Cultural Studies are primarily responsible for the formative scholarship of Critical Whiteness Studies.

[[Critical race theory|Critical race theorists]] such as Cheryl Harris&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Cheryl I. |last=Harris|title=Whiteness as Property |journal=Harvard Law Review |volume=106 |issue=8|pages=1709–95 |date=June 1993 |doi=10.2307/1341787 |jstor=1341787}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Lipsitz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Lipsitz |first=George| title= The Possessive Investment in Whiteness: How White People Profit From Identity Politics|year=2006 |publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn= 978-1-59213-493-9|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PIqUajTEfk0C&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; have said that "whiteness" has historically been treated more as a form of [[property]] than as a racial characteristic: In other words, as an object which has intrinsic value that must be protected by social and legal institutions.  Laws and [[mores]] concerning race (from [[apartheid]] and [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] constructions that legally separate different races to social prejudices against interracial relationships or mixed communities) serve the purpose of retaining certain advantages and privileges for whites. Because of this, academic and societal ideas about race have tended to focus solely on the disadvantages suffered by [[racial minorities]], overlooking the advantageous effects that accrue to whites.&lt;ref name="Lucal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lucal|first=Betsy|date=July 1996|title=Oppression and Privilege: Toward a Relational Conceptualization of Race|journal=Teaching Sociology|volume=24|issue=3|pages=245–55|issn=0092-055X|oclc=48950428|doi=10.2307/1318739|jstor=1318739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Arnesen]], an American labor historian, reviewed papers from a whiteness studies perspective published in his field in the 1990s, and found that the concept of whiteness was used so broadly during that time period that it wasn't useful.&lt;ref name=Arnesen/&gt;

===Whiteness unspoken===
From another perspective, white privilege is a way of conceptualizing racial inequalities that focuses on advantages that white people accrue from their position in society as well as the disadvantages that non-white people experience.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Constraint of Race'' (2004), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; This same idea is brought to light by [[Peggy McIntosh]], who wrote about white privilege from the perspective of a white individual. McIntosh states in her writing that, "as a white person, I realized I had been taught about racism as something which puts others at a disadvantage, but had been taught not to see one of its corollary aspects, white privilege which puts me at an advantage".&lt;ref name="McIntosh, P. 1988 p. 1"&gt;McIntosh, P. (1988). "White privilege: Packing the invisible backpack. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; To back this assertion, McIntosh notes a myriad of conditions in her article in which racial inequalities occur to favor whites, from renting or buying a home in a given area without suspicion of one's financial standing, to purchasing bandages in "flesh" color that closely matches a white person's skin tone. She further asserts that she sees
&lt;blockquote&gt;a pattern running through the matrix of white privilege, a pattern of assumptions which were passed on to me as a white person. There was one main piece of cultural turf; it was my own turf, and I was among those who could control the turf. My skin color was an asset for any move I was educated to want to make. I could think of myself as belonging in major ways, and of making social systems work for me. I could freely disparage, fear, neglect, or be oblivious to anything outside of the dominant cultural forms. Being of the main culture, I could also criticize it fairly freely.&lt;ref name="McIntosh, P. 1988 p. 1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Unjust enrichment===
[[Lawrence Blum]] refers to advantages for white people as "unjust enrichment" privileges, in which white people benefit from the injustices done to people of color, and he articulates that such privileges are deeply rooted in the U.S. culture and lifestyle:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When Blacks are denied access to desirable homes, for example, this is not just an injustice to Blacks but a positive benefit to Whites who now have a wider range of domicile options than they would have if Blacks had equal access to housing. When urban schools do a poor job of educating their Latino/a and Black students, this benefits Whites in the sense that it unjustly advantages them in the competition for higher levels of education and jobs. Whites in general cannot avoid benefiting from the historical legacy of racial discrimination and oppression. So unjust enrichment is almost never absent from the life situation of Whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blum | first1 = L. | year = 2008 | title = White privilege: A mild critique". In | url = | journal = Theory and Research in Education | volume = 6 | issue = 309| page = 311 | doi = 10.1177/1477878508095586 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Spared injustice===
[[File:Boston Protester White Privilege.jpg|thumb|upright|A protester holds a sign reading "They don't shoot white women like me" at a #BlackLivesMatter protest in the wake of the non-indictment of a New York City police officer for the [[death of Eric Garner]].]]
In Blum's analysis of the underlying structure of white privilege, "spared injustice" is when a person of color suffers an unjust treatment while a white person does not. His example of this is when "a Black person is stopped by the police without due cause but a White person is not".&lt;ref name="Blum, L. 2008 p. 311–312"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Blum | first = L. | year = 2008 | title = White privilege: A Mild Critique | url =http://tre.sagepub.com/content/6/3/309.abstract | journal = Theory and Research in Education | volume = 6 | issue = 309| pages=311–312| doi = 10.1177/1477878508095586 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He identifies "unjust enrichment" privileges as those for which whites are spared the injustice of a situation, and in turn, are benefiting from the injustice of others. For instance, "if police are too focused on looking for Black lawbreakers, they might be less vigilant toward White ones, conferring an unjust enrichment benefit on Whites who do break the laws but escape detection for this reason."&lt;ref name="Blum, L. 2008 p. 311–312"/&gt;

===Privileges not related to injustice===
Blum describes "non-injustice-related" privileges as those which are not associated with injustices experienced by people of color, but relate to a majority group's advantages over a minority group. Those who are in the majority, usually white people, gain "unearned privileges not founded on injustice."&lt;ref name="Blum, L. 2008 p. 311–312" /&gt; According to Blum, in workplace cultures there tends to be a partly ethnocultural character, so that some ethnic or racial groups' members find them more comfortable than do others.&lt;ref name="Blum, L. 2008 p. 311–312" /&gt;

===Framing racial inequality===
Dan J. Pence and J. Arthur Fields have observed resistance in the context of education to the idea that white privilege of this type exists, and suggest this resistance stems from a tendency to see inequality as a black or [[Latino]] issue. One report noted that white students often react to in-class discussions about white privilege with a continuum of behaviors ranging from outright hostility to a "wall of silence."&lt;ref name="Pence"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pence|first=Dan J.|author2=Fields, J. Arthur|date=April 1999|title=Teaching about Race and Ethnicity: Trying to Uncover White Privilege for a White Audience|journal=Teaching Sociology|volume=27|issue=2|pages=150–8|issn=0092-055X|oclc=48950428|doi=10.2307/1318701|jstor=1318701}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pair of studies on a broader population by Branscombe ''et al.'' found that framing racial issues in terms of white privilege as opposed to non-white disadvantages can produce a greater degree of racially biased responses from whites who have higher levels of racial identification. Branscombe ''et al.'' demonstrate that framing racial inequality in terms of the privileges of whites increased levels of [[white guilt]] among white respondents.  Those with high racial identification were more likely to give responses which concurred with modern [[racist]] attitudes than those with low racial identification.&lt;ref name="Branscombe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Branscombe|first=Nyla R.|author2=Schmitt, Michael T.|author3=Schiffhauer, Kristin|date=August 25, 2006|title=Racial Attitudes in Response to Thoughts of White Privilege|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|volume=37|issue=2|pages=203–15|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/112771384/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130106062349/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/112771384/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 6, 2013|accessdate=July 19, 2008|doi=10.1002/ejsp.348}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the studies' authors, these findings suggest that representing inequality in terms of [[outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]] disadvantage allows privileged group members to avoid the negative implications of inequality.&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Powell|first=Adam A.|author2=Branscombe, Nyla R.|author3=Schmitt, Michael T.|year=2005|title=Inequality as Ingroup Privilege or Outgroup Disadvantage: The Impact of Group Focus on Collective Guilt and Interracial Attitudes|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=31|issue=4|pages=508–21|url=http://data.psych.udel.edu/abelcher/Shared%20Documents/6%20General%20Diversity%20Issues%20%2815%29/Powell.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522013408/http://data.psych.udel.edu/abelcher/Shared%20Documents/6%20General%20Diversity%20Issues%20%2815%29/Powell.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 22, 2013|accessdate=April 15, 2013|doi=10.1177/0146167204271713|pmid=15743985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2019 study published in the ''[[Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|Journal of Experimental Psychology]]'' had socially liberal people read about white privilege, and then read about a poor person who was either black or white. They found that reading about white privilege did not increase empathy for either, and decreased it if the person was white. One of the study's authors said that this demonstrates the importance of nuance, and recognizing individual differences, when teaching about white privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jilani |first1=Zaid |title=What Happens When You Educate Liberals About White Privilege? |url=https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/what_happens_when_you_educate_liberals_about_white_privilege |accessdate=4 June 2019 |work=Greater Good |publisher=[[Greater Good Science Center]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cooley |first1=Erin |last2=Brown-Iannuzzi |first2=Jazmin L. |last3=Lei |first3=Ryan F. |last4=Cipolli |first4=William |title=Complex intersections of race and class: Among social liberals, learning about White privilege reduces sympathy, increases blame, and decreases external attributions for White people struggling with poverty. |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General |date=29 April 2019 |doi=10.1037/xge0000605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===White fragility===
[[Robin DiAngelo]] created the term "white fragility".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anna-kegler/the-sugarcoated-language-of-white-fragility_b_10909350.html|title=The Sugarcoated Language Of White Fragility {{!}} Huffington Post|last=Feminist|first=Anna Kegler|last2=writer|date=July 22, 2016|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=September 30, 2016|last3=Nerd|first3=Messaging}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has said that "white privilege can be thought of as unstable racial equilibrium",&lt;ref name="IJCP"/&gt; and that when this equilibrium is challenged, the resulting racial stress can become intolerable and trigger a range of defensive responses. DiAngelo defines these behaviors as white fragility. For example, DiAngelo observed in her studies that some white people, when confronted with racial issues concerning white privilege,  may respond with dismissal, distress, or other defensive responses because they may feel personally implicated in white supremacy.&lt;ref name="Waldman18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lopez17"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lopez |first1=German |title=The Charlottesville protests are white fragility in action |url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/8/12/16138558/charlottesville-va-white-fragility |accessdate=12 October 2018 |work=Vox |date=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, it has been summarized as "the trademark inability of [[white Americans]] to meaningfully own their unearned privilege".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Harmon|first1=Amy |title=Prove You’re Not White: For an Article About Race-Verification on Reddit, I Had an Unusual Request |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/reader-center/08insider-reddit-race-black-people-twitter-reporting.html |accessdate= |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=8 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DiAngelo also writes that white privilege is very rarely discussed and that even multicultural education courses tend to use vocabulary that further obfuscates racial privilege and defines race as something that only concerns blacks. She suggests using loaded terminology with negative connotations to people of color adds to the cycle of white privilege,
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is far more the norm for these courses and programs to use racially coded language such as 'urban,' 'inner city,' and 'disadvantaged' but to rarely use 'white' or 'overadvantaged' or 'privileged.' This racially coded language reproduces racist images and perspectives while it simultaneously reproduces the comfortable illusion that race and its problems are what 'they' have, not us.&lt;ref name="IJCP"&gt;{{cite journal|last=DiAngelo|first=Robin |title= White Fragility |journal= The International Journal of Critical Pedagogy |year= 2011 |pages= 54–70 |volume= 3 |issue= 3|url= https://libjournal.uncg.edu/index.php/ijcp/article/download/249/116 |accessdate= March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
She does say, however, that defensiveness and discomfort from white people in response to being confronted with racial issues is not irrational but rather is often driven by subconscious, sometimes even well-meaning, attitudes toward racism.&lt;ref name="Waldman18"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Waldman |first1=Katy |title=A Sociologist Examines the "White Fragility" That Prevents White Americans from Confronting Racism |url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/a-sociologist-examines-the-white-fragility-that-prevents-white-americans-from-confronting-racism |accessdate=12 October 2018 |work=The New Yorker |date=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White backlash, the negative reaction of some [[white people]] to the advancement of non-whites, has been described as a possible response to the societal examination of white privilege, or the perceived actual of hypothetical loss of that racial privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/24/george-yancy-dear-white-america-philosopher-confront-racism |title=Is white America ready to confront its racism?

A 2015 [[Valparaiso University School of Law|Valparaiso University]] journal, fundamentally connects the phenomena, suggesting this backlash is inextricably a result of white privilege; "White backlash —the adverse reaction of whites to the progress of members of a non-dominant  group— is  symptomatic  of  a  condition  created  by  the  gestalt of white privilege".&lt;ref name="whitebacklashbrowncountry2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Terry|title=Valparaiso University Law Review: White Backlash in a Brown Country|publisher=[[Valparaiso University School of Law]]|year=2015|pages=89-132|volume=50|issue=1|quote=Most importantly,  voter  suppression  abets  an  addiction  to  white  privilege—which  is  the  source  of  white  backlash—by  advancing  the  idea  that  the  voters  who  are  prevented  from  accessing  the  polls  were  less  worthy  to  vote in the first place.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on political scientist [[Danielle Allen]]'s analysis that demographic shifts "provoke resistance from those whose well-being, status and self-esteem are connected to historical privileges of 'whiteness'",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trumps-troubling-us-constituency-2015-9 |title=Trump is tapping into a troubling US constituency |authorlink=Danielle Allen|author=Danielle Allen|quote=|date=September 7, 2015 |work=[[Business Insider]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DePaul University College of Law|DePaul University]] professor Terry Smith has explored the interconnectivity of the concepts in the essay ''White Backlash in a Brown Country'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;The hallmark of addiction is "protection of one’s source." The same is true of backlash.  The  linear  model  of  equality  drastically  underestimates  the  lengths  to  which people accustomed to certain privileges will go to protect them.  It assigns to [[white Americans]] a preternatural ability to adapt to change and see  their  fellow  citizens  of  color  as  equal.&lt;ref name="whitebacklashbrowncountry2015" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2018's ''Backlash: What Happens When We Talk Honestly about Racism in America'', [[George Yancy]] expands on the concept of white backlash as an extreme response to loss of privilege, suggesting that DiAngelo's [[white fragility]] is a subtle form of defensiveness in comparison to the examples of visceral racism and threats of violence, that the professor has examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Backlash: What Happens When We Talk Honestly about Racism in America|author1=George Yancy|authorlink1=George Yancy|author2=|quote=The responses that I received, however, speak to something more extreme than just reactionary or unreceptive responses.

==Global==
White privilege functions differently in different places. A person's white skin will not be an asset to them in every conceivable place or situation. White people are also a global minority, and this fact affects the experiences they have outside of their home areas. Nevertheless, some people who use the term "white privilege" describe it as a worldwide phenomenon, resulting from the history of colonialism by white Western Europeans. One author states that American white men are privileged almost everywhere in the world, even though many countries have never been colonized by Western Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Jacques]], "[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/sep/20/race.uk The global hierarchy of race: As the only racial group that never suffers systemic racism, whites are in denial about its impact]", ''The Guardian'', September 19, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Merryfield | first1 = Merry M. | year = 2000 | title = Why aren't teachers being prepared to teach for diversity, equity, and global interconnectedness?

Research into white males [[Ethnic_groups_of_Japan#Demographic|residing in Japan]], has shown a significant minority's use of a gendered white privilege in sexual encounters with [[women in Japan|Japanese women]], in forms that, while limited, are described as exploitatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Migration, Whiteness, and Cosmopolitanism: Europeans in Japan|author=Miloš Debnár|quote=White men extensively using their 'white privilege' in sexual encounters with Japanese women represent only one, and arguably, a limited part of the white European population in Japan. ...

===Africa===
====South Africa====
[[File:Population registration certificate South Africa 1988.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Registration certificate identifies a person as white]]
White privilege was legally enshrined in South Africa through [[apartheid]]. Apartheid was institutionalized in 1948 and lasted formally into the early 1990s. Under apartheid, racial privilege was not only socially meaningful—it became bureaucratically regulated. Laws such as the 1950 [[Population Registration Act, 1950|Population Registration Act]] established criteria to officially classify South Africans by race: White, Indian, Coloured (mixed), or Black.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Posel, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/525576 "Race as Common Sense: Racial Classification in Twentieth-Century South Africa"], ''African Studies Review'' 44 (2), September 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars say that 'whiteness' still corresponds to a set of social advantages in South Africa, and conventionally refer to these advantages as "white privilege". The system of white privilege applies both to the way a person is treated by others and to a set of behaviors, affects, and thoughts, which can be learned and reinforced. These elements of "whiteness" establish social status and guarantee advantages for some people, without directly relying on skin color or other aspects of a person's appearance.&lt;ref name=Vice/&gt; White privilege in South Africa has small-scale effects, such as preferential treatment for people who appear white in public, and large-scale effects, such as the over five-fold difference in average per-capita income for people identified as white or black.&lt;ref&gt;Sally Matthews, "[http://mg.co.za/article/2011-09-12-inherited-or-earned-advantage Inherited or earned advantage?]", ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', September 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Afrikaner]] whiteness" has also been described as a partially subordinate identity, relative to the [[British Empire]] and [[Boerehaat]] (a type of prejudice towards Afrikaners), "disgraced" further by the end of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steyn | first1 = Melissa E. | year = 2004| title = Rehabilitating a whiteness disgraced: Afrikaner white talk in post‐apartheid South Africa | journal = Communication Quarterly | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 143–169| doi = 10.1080/01463370409370187 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fear that white South Africans suffer from "[[reverse racism]]" at the hands of the country's newly empowered majority,&lt;ref&gt;Samantha Vice, "[http://mg.co.za/article/2011-09-02-why-my-opinions-on-whiteness-touched-a-nerve/ Why my opinions on whiteness touched a nerve]", ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', September 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; "Unfair" racial discrimination is prohibited by [[Section Nine of the Constitution of South Africa]], and this section also allows for laws to be made to address "unfair discrimination".

In 2014, the [[Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario]] received media coverage when it publicly advertised a workshop for educators about methods of teaching white privilege to students. ''[[White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack]]'' had become one of its most recommended teaching tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/how-legos-helped-build-a-classroom-lesson-on-white-privilege/article36610854/ |title=How Legos helped build a classroom lesson on white privilege |authorlink=|author=Dakshana Bascaramurty|quote=|date=October 16, 2017|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[2014 Toronto mayoral election]], then-candidate [[John Tory]] denied the existence of white privilege in a debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/what-is-white-privilege-1.2852643 |title=What is white privilege?  |authorlink=|author=|quote=During the municipal election campaign, John Tory, who takes office next week as mayor of Toronto, was asked bluntly: "Does white privilege exist?"Tory's response was, "White privilege?

In 2019, the [[Canadian Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences]] suspended a man from attending their annual meeting for three years for racially profiling a [[black Canadian]] scholar. The federation stated that it required the offender to demonstrate that he had taken measures to increase his awareness of white privilege before he would be allowed to attend any future congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-man-suspended-from-meetings-for-racial-profiling-of-black-scholar-at/ |title=Man suspended from meetings for racial profiling of black scholar at University of British Columbia humanities congress |authorlink=|author=Michael Tutton|quote=|date=August 29, 2019 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the year, a former [[First Nations in Manitoba]] grand chief stated how many [[indigenous Canadians]] perceived the [[court system of Canada]] to discriminate against them under the structure of white skin privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/supreme-court-winnipeg-1.5291278 |title=Supreme Court hears cases in Winnipeg this week in historic first |authorlink=|author=Karen Pauls|quote=|date=September 23, 2019 |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Gary Mason (journalist)|Gary Mason]] has suggested that the phenomenon is embedded within the culture of [[fraternities and sororities in Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-is-it-time-we-said-goodbye-to-fraternities/ |title=Is it time we said goodbye to fraternities? |authorlink=Gary Mason (journalist)|author=Gary Mason|quote=|date=October 4, 2019 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
Some scholars attribute white privilege, which they describe as informal racism, to the formal racism (i.e. [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] followed by [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]]) that existed for much of American history.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Constraint of Race'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; In her book ''Privilege Revealed: How Invisible Preference Undermines America'', Stephanie M. Wildman writes that many Americans who advocate a merit-based, race-free worldview do not acknowledge the systems of privilege which have benefited them. For example, many Americans rely on a social or financial inheritance from previous generations, an inheritance unlikely to be forthcoming if one's ancestors were slaves.&lt;ref name="Wildman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wildman|first=Stephanie M.|author2=Armstrong, Margalynne|author3=Davis, Adrienne D.|author4=Grillo, Trina|title=Privilege Revealed: How Invisible Preference Undermines America|publisher=NYU Press|location=New York|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8147-9303-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LK-aQDstH6kC&amp;dq=Privilege+Revealed:+How+Invisible+Preference+Undermines+America&amp;printsec=frontcover|accessdate=July 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whites were sometimes afforded opportunities and benefits that were unavailable to others.

=====Wealth=====
According to Roderick Harrison "wealth is a measure of cumulative advantage or disadvantage" and "the fact that black and Hispanic wealth is a fraction of white wealth also reflects a history of discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/18/national/18wealth.html Study Says White Families' Wealth Advantage Has Grown]." ''New York Times'' October 18, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Whites have historically had more opportunities to accumulate wealth.&lt;ref name="wealth"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Melvin L. Oliver|author2=Thomas M.

Over the past 40 years, there has been less formal [[discrimination in the United States|discrimination in America]]; the [[Racial wealth gap in the United States|inequality in wealth between racial groups]] however, is still extant.&lt;ref name=wealth/&gt; George Lipsitz asserts that because wealthy whites were able to pass along their wealth in the form of inheritances and transformative assets (inherited wealth which lifts a family beyond their own achievements), white Americans on average continually accrue advantages.&lt;ref name=possessive/&gt;{{rp|107–8}} Pre-existing disparities in wealth are exacerbated by tax policies that reward investment over waged income, subsidize mortgages, and subsidize private sector developers.&lt;ref name="Lipsitz"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lipsitz|first=George|date=September 1995|title=The Possessive Investment in Whiteness: Racialized Social Democracy and the "White" Problem in American Studies|journal=American Quarterly|volume=47|issue=3|pages=369–87|doi=10.2307/2713291|jstor=2713291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Shapiro wrote that wealth is passed along from generation to generation, giving whites a better "starting point" in life than other races. According to Shapiro, many whites receive financial assistance from their parents allowing them to live beyond their income. This, in turn, enables them to buy houses and major assets which aid in the accumulation of wealth. Since houses in white neighborhoods appreciate faster, even African Americans who are able to overcome their "starting point" are unlikely to accumulate wealth as fast as whites. Shapiro asserts this is a continual cycle from which whites consistently benefit.&lt;ref name="Shapiro"&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas M. |last=Shapiro |title=The Hidden Cost of Being African American; How Wealth Perpetuates Inequality |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-518138-8 |date=December 12, 2003 |url=https://archive.org/details/hiddencostofbein00shap }}&lt;/ref&gt; These benefits also have effects on schooling and other life opportunities.&lt;ref name=possessive/&gt;{{rp|32–3}}

Royster compared black and white males who graduated from the same school with the same skills.  In looking at their success with school-work transition and working experiences, she found that white graduates were more often employed in skilled trades, earned more, held higher status positions, received more promotions and experienced shorter periods of unemployment. Since all other factors were similar, the differences in employment experiences were attributed to race.  Royster concluded that the primary cause of these racial differences was due to [[social networking]]. The concept of "who you know" seemed just as important to these graduates as "what you know".

According to the distinctiveness theory, posited by [[University of Kentucky]] professor Ajay Mehra and colleagues, people identify with other people who share similar characteristics which are otherwise rare in their environment; women identify more with women, whites with other whites. Because of this, Mehra finds that white males tend to be highly central in their social networks due to their numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Karsten|editor1-first=Margaret Foegen|title=Gender, Race, and Ethnicity in the Workplace: Organizational practices and individual strategies for women and minorities|date=2006|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn.

According to Royster, "these ideologies provide a contemporary deathblow to working-class black men's chances of establishing a foothold in the traditional trades."&lt;ref name="Royster" /&gt;

This concept is similar to the theory created by [[Mark Granovetter]] which analyzes the importance of social networking and [[interpersonal ties]] with his paper "The Strength of Weak Ties" and his other economic sociology work.

Other research shows that there is a correlation between a person's name and his or her likelihood of receiving a call back for a job interview. [[Marianne Bertrand]] and [[Sendhil Mullainathan]] found in field experiment in Boston and Chicago that people with "white-sounding" names are 50% more likely to receive a call back than people with "black-sounding" names, despite equal résumé quality between the two racial groups.&lt;ref name="Bertrand"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bertrand|first=Marianne |author2=Mullainathan, Sendhil|date=September 2004|title=Are Emily and Greg More Employable Than Lakisha and Jamal?

[[Housing discrimination in the United States|Discrimination in housing policies]] was formalized in 1934 under the Federal Housing Act which provided government credit to private lending for home buyers.&lt;ref name=possessive/&gt;{{rp|5}}  Within the Act, the Federal Housing Agency had the authority to channel all the money to white home buyers instead of minorities.&lt;ref name=possessive/&gt;{{rp|5}}  The FHA also channeled money away from inner-city neighborhoods after World War II and instead placed it in the hands of white home buyers who would move into segregated suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |first=Paula S. |last=Rothenberg |year=2005 |title=White Privilege |location=New York |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-0-7167-8733-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These, and other, practices intensified attitudes of segregation and inequality.

The "single greatest source of wealth" for white Americans is the growth in value in their owner-occupied homes. The family wealth so generated is the most important contribution to wealth disparity between black and white Americans.&lt;ref name="possessive"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Lipsitz|title=The Possessive Investment in Whiteness: How White People Profit from Identity Politics, Revised and Expanded Edition|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PIqUajTEfk0C|date=August 21, 2009|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-59213-495-3|pages=32–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32–33}}{{Dubious | Housing | reason = Poorly sourced.

Brown, Carnoey and Oppenheimer, in "Whitewashing Race: The Myth of a Color-Blind Society," write that the financial inequities created by discriminatory housing practices also have an ongoing effect on young black families, since the net worth of one's parents is the best predictor of one's own net worth, so discriminatory financial policies of the past contribute to race-correlated financial inequities of today.&lt;ref name="whitewashing"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael K.

=====Education=====
{{further|Racial achievement gap in the United States}}
According to Stephanie Wildman and Ruth Olson, education policies in the US have contributed to the construction and reinforcement of white privilege.&lt;ref&gt;Wildman, Stephanie M.

Williams and Rivers (1972b) showed that test instructions in Standard English disadvantaged the black child and that if the language of the test is put in familiar labels without training or coaching, the child's performances on the tests increase significantly.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, R.L. and Rivers, L.W.

According to [[Janet E.

African Americans are disproportionately sent to [[special education]] classes in their schools, and identified as being disruptive or suffering from a learning disability. These students are segregated for the majority of the school day, taught by uncertified teachers, and do not receive high school diplomas. Wanda Blanchett has said that white students have consistently privileged interactions with the special education system, which provides 'non-normal' whites with the resources they need to benefit from the mainline white educational structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blanchett | first1 = Wanda J. | year = 2006| title = Disproportionate Representation of African American Students in Special Education: Acknowledging the Role of White Privilege and Racism | url = http://edr.sagepub.com/content/35/6/24 | journal = Educational Researcher | volume = 35 | issue = 24| page = 2006 | doi = 10.3102/0013189X035006024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Educational inequality is also a consequence of housing.  Since most states determine school funding based on property taxes,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} schools in wealthier neighborhoods receive more funding per student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=National center for education statistics|title=The condition of education 2000|date=2000|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|location=Washington DC|pages=102|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2000/2000062.pdf|accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As home values in white neighborhoods are higher than minority neighborhoods,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} local schools receive more funding via property taxes. This will ensure better technology in predominantly white schools, smaller class sizes and better quality teachers, giving white students opportunities for a better education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Erin E. |last=Kelly |year=1995 |title=All Students Are Not Created Equal: The Inequitable Combination of Property Tax-Based School Finance Systems and Local Control |journal=Duke Law Journal |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=397–435 |doi=10.2307/1372907 |jstor=1372907 |url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/dlj/vol45/iss2/3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of schools placed on academic probation as part of district accountability efforts are majority African-American and low-income.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, John B. &amp; James P.

[[Wealth inequality in the United States|Inequalities in wealth]] and housing allow a higher proportion of white parents the option to move to better school districts or afford to put their children in private schools if they do not approve of the neighborhood's schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Shapiro |year=2004 |title=The Hidden Cost of Being African American; How Wealth Perpetuates Inequality |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=157 |isbn=978-0-19-518138-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/hiddencostofbein00shap }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing unequal test scores between public school students, opinion columnist Matt Rosenberg laments the Seattle Public Schools' emphasis on "institutional racism" and "white privilege":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The disparity is not simply a matter of color: School District data indicate income, English-language proficiency and home stability are also important correlates to achievement...By promoting the "white privilege" canard and by designing a student indoctrination plan, the Seattle School District is putting retrograde, leftist politics ahead of academics, while the perpetrators of "white privilege" are minimizing the capabilities of minorities.&lt;ref name="STRosen"&gt;Rosenberg, Matt (2007-04-11), [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2003661182_matt11.html "Putting politics ahead of kids"].

Ray Minniecon, director of Crossroads Aboriginal Ministries, described the city of [[Sydney]] specifically as "the most alien and inhospitable place of all to Aboriginal culture and people."&lt;ref&gt;Ray Minniecon, "[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/02/16/1076779903465.html Despair the reality for a race lost in the alien space of Redfern]", ''Sydney Morning Herald'', February 17, 2004; quoted by Suvendrini Perera, "[http://www.acrawsa.org.au/files/ejournalfiles/64SuvendriniPerera.pdf 'Aussie Luck': the Border Politics of Citizenship Post Cronulla Beach] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410063014/http://acrawsa.org.au/files/ejournalfiles/64SuvendriniPerera.pdf |date=April 10, 2013 }}", ''ACRAWSA e-journal'' [http://www.acrawsa.org.au/ejournal/?id=23 3(1)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409210028/http://acrawsa.org.au/ejournal/?id=23 |date=April 9, 2013 }}, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; At the other end of the spectrum, anti-racist white Australians working with Indigenous people may experience their privilege as painful "stigma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kowal|first=Emma|title=THE STIGMA OF WHITE PRIVILEGE|journal=Cultural Studies|date=May 1, 2011|volume=25|issue=3|pages=313–333|doi=10.1080/09502386.2010.491159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of white privilege in Australia have increased since the late 1990s, with several books published on the history of how whiteness became a dominant identity. Aileen Moreton-Robinson's ''Talkin' Up to the White Woman'' is a critique of unexamined white privilege in the Australian feminist movement.&lt;ref name="Ganley"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ganley | first1 = Toby | title = What's all this talk about whiteness? | url = http://www.polsis.uq.edu.au/dialogue/vol-1-2-4.pdf | journal = Dialogue | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | year = 2003 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130428181555/http://www.polsis.uq.edu.au//dialogue/vol-1-2-4.pdf | archivedate = April 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian Critical Race and Whiteness Studies Association formed in 2005 to study racial privilege and promote respect for Indigenous sovereignties; it publishes an online journal called ''Critical Race and Whiteness Studies''.&lt;ref&gt;"ACRAWSA: About", ''Australian Critical Race and Whiteness Studies Association'', updated January 30, 2012; accessed November 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand, a localized relationship to the concept, frequently termed Pakeha privilege,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11794425 |title=Why the Treaty of Waitangi matters|author= |date=February 4, 2017 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the legacy of the colonizing [[Pākehā settlers]], has developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Max Harris|authorlink=|quote= In South Africa and the US, among other places, there is an increasing literature on whiteness and white privilege. But much less has been written or said about white privilege, or Pākehā privilege, in New Zealand – though this is changing.|title=The New Zealand Project|date=2017|publisher=[[Bridget Williams Books]]|location=|isbn=978-0947492588|page=68|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the country's colonial era, Pakeha privilege was enforced in school classrooms by strict time periods, European symbols such as the [[English alphabet]] and [[Western Numerals]], and exclusion of [[Te Reo]] (the Māori language). All of which would have been alienating and disadvantaging for Māori children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Consedine|author2=Joanna Consedine|quote=In colonial times a range of mechanisms were used in schools to reinforce Pakeha privilege and values, including rigid time periods, European symbols around the room, and the exclusion of Maori language.|title=Healing Our History: The Challenge of the Treaty of Waitangi|date=2012|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|location=|isbn=978-0143567691|page=123|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic [[Huia Jahnke]]'s ''Mana Tangata: Politics of Empowerment'' has explored how [[European New Zealanders]] rejecting the 'one people' national narrative, naming themselves 'other' by embracing the label [[Pākehā]], has allowed space to examine white privilege and the societal marginalization of [[Māori people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bronwyn Campbell|authorlink=|editor1=Huia Tomlins-Jahnke|editor2=Malcolm Mulholland|quote=Pakeha naming themselves as 'other' also demonstrates a willingness to challenge both Pakeha privilege and Maori marginalisation (Spoonley 1995a; Bell 1996).|title=Mana Tangata: Politics of Empowerment|date=2013|publisher=[[Huia Publishers]]|location=|isbn=978-1775500216|page=|chapter=Te Tiriti o Waitangi: A Blueprint for the Future}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massey University]] scholar Malcolm Mulholland has stated that "studying inequalities between Maori and non-Maori outcomes allows us to identify Pakeha privilege and name it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=State of the Māori Nation: Twenty-first Century Issues in Aotearoa|author=Malcolm Mulholland|authorlink=|quote=|date=2006|publisher=[[Reed Publishing]]|location=|isbn=978-0790010427|page=29|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, on the 65th anniversary of [[Te Rōpū Wāhine Māori Toko I te Ora]], the League's president criticized the "dominant Pakeha culture" in New Zealand, and embedded Pakeha privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/maori-womens-welfare-league-leader-slams-embedded-pakeha-privilege |title=Maori Women's Welfare League leader slams 'embedded Pakeha privilege' |author= |date=September 28, 2016 |publisher=[[TVNZ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
