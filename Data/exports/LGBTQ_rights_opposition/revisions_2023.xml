{{LGBT rights}}

'''LGBT rights opposition''' is the opposition to [[legal rights]], proposed or enacted, for [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) people. Laws that LGBT rights opponents may be opposed to include [[Civil unions|civil unions or partnerships]], [[LGBT parenting]] and [[LGBT adoption|adoption]], [[Sexual orientation and military service|military service]], access to [[assisted reproductive technology]], and access to [[sex reassignment surgery]] and [[hormone replacement therapy (transgender)|hormone replacement therapy]] for [[transgender]] individuals.

Organizations influential in [[LGBT rights]] opposition frequently oppose the enactment of laws making [[same-sex marriage]] legal, the passage of anti-discrimination laws aimed at curtailing [[Discrimination against LGBT people|anti-LGBT discrimination]], including in employment and housing, the passage of anti-bullying laws to protect LGBT minors, laws decriminalizing same-gender relationships, and other LGBT rights-related laws.&lt;ref name="Fetner 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author-last=Fetner |author-first=Tina |date=August 2001 |title=Working Anita Bryant: The Impact of Christian Anti-Gay Activism on Lesbian and Gay Movement Claims |journal=[[Social Problems]] |volume=48 |issue=3 |location=[[Oxford]] and [[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] on behalf of the [[Society for the Study of Social Problems]] |pages=411–428 |doi=10.1525/sp.2001.48.3.411 |hdl=11375/21175 |issn=1533-8533 |s2cid=144876642|hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups are often [[Conservatism#Religious conservatism|religious]] or [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] in nature.{{refn|&lt;ref name="Gannon 1981"&gt;{{cite journal |author-last=Gannon |author-first=Thomas M. |date=July–September 1981 |title=The New Christian Right in America as a Social and Political Force |url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/assr_0335-5985_1981_num_52_1_2226 |journal=Archives de Sciences Sociales des Religions |location=[[Paris]] |publisher=[[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|Éditions de l'EHESS]] |volume=26 |issue=52–1 |pages=69–83 |doi=10.3406/assr.1981.2226 |issn=0335-5985 |jstor=30125411 |access-date=2022-07-07 |archive-date=2018-06-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180602141039/https://www.persee.fr/doc/assr_0335-5985_1981_num_52_1_2226 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McKeegan 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |author-last=McKeegan |author-first=Michele |date=Fall 1993 |title=The politics of abortion: A historical perspective |journal=[[Women's Health Issues (journal)|Women's Health Issues]] |publisher=[[Elsevier]] on behalf of the [[Jacobs Institute of Women's Health]] |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=127–131 |doi=10.1016/S1049-3867(05)80245-2 |issn=1878-4321 |pmid=8274866 |s2cid=36048222}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ibrahim 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |author-last=Ibrahim |author-first=Nur Amali |date=October 2016 |title=Homophobic Muslims: Emerging Trends in Multireligious Singapore |journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History |volume=58 |issue=4 |location=[[Cambridge]] and [[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |pages=955–981 |doi=10.1017/S0010417516000499 |issn=1475-2999 |jstor=26293235 |s2cid=152039212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lawnet.fordham.edu"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rehman |first1=Javaid |last2=Polymenopoulou |first2=Eleni |date=2013 |title=Is Green a Part of the Rainbow?

== History ==
[[File:Institut für Sexualwissenschaft - Bibliothek 1933.jpg|thumb|left|[[German Student Union]] members plunder the [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] in preparation to [[Nazi book burning|burn its books]], May 1933]]
The first organized [[gay rights movement]] arose in the late nineteenth century in Germany.&lt;ref name=chron&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/CHR06.HTM|title=Archive for Sexology|work=hu-berlin.de|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709054341/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/CHR06.HTM|archive-date=2008-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s and into the early 1930s, there were LGBT communities in cities like Berlin; German-Jewish sexologist [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] was one of the most notable spokespeople for LGBT rights at this time. When the Nazi party came to power in 1933, one of the party's first acts was to burn down Hirschfeld's ''[[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]]'', where many prominent Nazis had been treated for perceived sexual problems.&lt;ref name="Lenz"&gt;{{cite book |quote=...not ten percent of those men who, in 1933, took the fate of Germany into their hands, were sexually normal |first=Ludwig L. |last=Lenz |title=The Memoirs of a Sexologist |location=New York |year=1954 |page=429}} quoted in {{cite journal |first=Erwin |last=Haeberle |title=Swastika, Pink Triangle, and Yellow Star – The Destruction of Sexology and the Persecution of Homosexuals in Nazi Germany |journal=The Journal of Sex Research |volume=17 |issue=3 |date=August 1981 |pages=270–287 |doi=10.1080/00224498109551120 |url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/SWAST.HTM |via=Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin |access-date=2010-04-14 |archive-date=2010-04-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416025939/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/SWAST.HTM |url-status=dead |jstor=3812563 |pmid=28135957 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially tolerant to the homosexuality of [[Ernst Röhm]] and his followers, many [[gay men]] were purged from the Nazi Party following the [[Night of the Long Knives]] and the [[Paragraph 175|Section 175 Laws]] began to be enforced again, with gay men interned in [[concentration camp]]s by 1938.&lt;ref group=note&gt;See [[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Nazi]] rule in Germany, the dismantling of rights for LGBT individuals was approached in two ways. By strengthening and re-enforcing existing laws that had fallen into disuse, male homosexuality was effectively re-criminalised; homosexuality was treated as a medical disorder, but at a social level rather than individual level intended to reduce the incidence of homosexuality. The treatment was a program of [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics]], starting with [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilisation]], then a system of working people to death in forced labour camps, and eventually refined by medical scientists to include [[euthanasia]]. The driving force was the elimination of perceived [[Racial hygiene|degeneracy]] at various levels – genetic, social, identity and practice, and the elimination of such genetic material in society. Lifton wrote about this in his book ''The Nazi Doctors'':&lt;ref name="LIFTON"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lifton |first=Robert |title=The Nazi Doctors: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide |publisher=Basic Books |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] sexology and defense of homosexuality [...] were aspects of "sexual degeneration, a breakdown of the family and loss of all that is decent," and ultimately the destruction of the German Volk. [...] medicine was to join in the great national healing mission, and the advance image of what Nazi doctors were actually to become: the healer turned killer. [...] Sterilization policies were always associated with the therapeutic and regenerative principles of the biomedical vision: with the "purification of the national body" and the "eradication of morbid hereditary dispositions." Sterilization was considered part of "negative eugenics" [...]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/lifton/LiftonT042.shtml|title=Lifton' Nazi Doctors p.42|work=holocaust-history.org|access-date=2009-06-29|archive-date=2009-07-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718203340/http://www.holocaust-history.org/lifton/LiftonT042.shtml|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is argued that the number of gay people who perished in the Holocaust was quite low in comparison to other [[Holocaust victims]], and confined to Germany itself, based on estimates that of 50,000 gay people who came before the courts, between 5,000 and 15,000&lt;ref name=ushm&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/information/exhibitions/traveling-exhibitions/nazi-persecution-of-homosexuals |title=Nazi Persecution of Homosexuals 1933–1945 |publisher=Ushmm.org |access-date=21 August 2013 |archive-date=14 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114212332/http://www.ushmm.org/information/exhibitions/traveling-exhibitions/nazi-persecution-of-homosexuals |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaust-trc.org/homosx.htm |title=Homosexuals – Holocaust Teacher Resource Center |publisher=Holocaust-trc.org |access-date=21 August 2013 |archive-date=26 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926105718/http://www.holocaust-trc.org/homosx.htm |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; ended up in concentration camps. However, many of those who came before the courts were directed (or volunteered) to undergo sterilisation/castration; they would be included with others who, in line with the historic shift in German society (that started with [[Karl Friedrich Otto Westphal|Westphal]], and developed through [[Krafft-Ebing]] to [[Magnus Hirschfeld]], of homosexuality being seen as having a neurological, endocrinological or genetic basis), were treated for homosexuality as a medical rather than criminal matter.

After the [[Second World War]], the [[United States]] became more intolerant of homosexuality,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Klarman: ''From the Closet to the Altar: Courts, Backlash, and the Struggle for Same-Sex Marriage''.  Oxford University Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; but many gay men and lesbians decided to reveal their gay identities after meeting others in the military.&lt;ref name=infoplease&gt;{{cite web|title=Milestones in the Gay Rights Movement|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0194028.html|website=infoplease.com|publisher=Houghton Miffin Company|access-date=14 February 2015|archive-date=10 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210001759/http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0194028.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many gay bars and villages were created, and a whole gay [[subculture]] formed.&lt;ref name=infoplease/&gt; Campaigns for gay rights began to develop, initially in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=1957: Homosexuality 'should not be a crime'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/4/newsid_3007000/3007686.stm|website=news.bbc.co.uk|date=4 September 1957|publisher=BBC|access-date=14 February 2015|archive-date=15 December 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215085041/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/4/newsid_3007000/3007686.stm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the 1960s homosexuality began to be decriminalised and de-medicalised in areas such as the UK, New Zealand, Australia, North America and Europe, in the context of the [[sexual revolution]] and [[anti-psychiatry]] movements.

==Public opinion==
{{Main|Societal attitudes toward homosexuality}}
Societal attitudes towards homosexuality vary greatly in different cultures and different historical periods, as do attitudes toward sexual desire, activity and relationships in general. All cultures have their own [[Sexual norm|norms regarding appropriate and inappropriate sexuality]]; some sanction same-sex love and sexuality, while others disapprove of such activities.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stephen O., ''Homosexualities'', University of Chicago 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

According to The 2007 Pew Global Attitudes Project, "Throughout Western Europe and much of the Americas, there is widespread tolerance towards homosexuality. However, the United States, Japan, South Korea, and Israel stand apart from other wealthy nations on this issue; in each of these countries, fewer than half of those surveyed say homosexuality should be accepted by society. Meanwhile, in most of Africa, Asia and the Middle East, there is less tolerance toward homosexuality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Publics Welcome Global Trade – But Not Immigration |url=http://pewglobal.org/files/pdf/258.pdf|website=pewglobal.org|publisher=The Pew Global Attitudes Project|access-date=14 February 2015|date=4 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205193757/http://pewglobal.org/files/pdf/258.pdf|archive-date=5 February 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scientology opposition ===
{{Main|Scientology and sexual orientation}}
[[Scientology]] founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] classified homosexuality as a mental illness and [[paraphilia]] (then known as "sexual perversion"), citing contemporary psychiatric and psychological textbooks to support his view.&lt;ref&gt;"The sexual pervert (and by this term Dianetics, to be brief, includes any and all forms of deviation in Dynamic II [i.e. sexuality] such as homosexuality, lesbianism, sexual sadism, etc., and all down the catalog of [[Havelock Ellis|Ellis]] and [[Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing|Krafft-Ebing]]) is actually quite ill physically...he is very far from culpable for his condition, but he is also far from normal and extremely dangerous to society..." {{cite book | last=Hubbard | title=Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health | pages=122–123 | publisher=Church of Scientology of California | year=1978 | isbn=0-88404-000-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gay people are designated a 1.1. on Hubbard's [[emotional tone scale]], and Hubbard urged society to tackle the issue of "sexual perversion" (including homosexuality), calling it "of vital importance, if one wishes to stop immorality, and the abuse of children." In his book ''[[Science of Survival]]'', Hubbard called for drastic action to be taken, saying that: "Such people should be taken from the society as rapidly as possible and uniformly institutionalized; for here is the level of the contagion of immorality, and the destruction of ethics; here is the fodder which secret police organizations use for their filthy operations."&lt;ref name="sos1"&gt;{{cite book | last=Hubbard | title=Science of Survival | pages=[https://archive.org/details/scienceofsurviva00lron_0/page/88 88–90] | publisher=Church of Scientology of California | year=1975 | isbn=0-88404-001-1 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/scienceofsurviva00lron_0/page/88 }} "Such people should be taken from the society as rapidly as possible and uniformly institutionalized; for here is the level of the contagion of immorality, and the destruction of ethics; here is the fodder which secret police organizations use for their filthy operations.

In this level is the slime of society, the sex criminals, the political subversives, the people whose apparently rational activities are yet but the devious writhings of secret hate."&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 article in the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' reported that the Scientology defines marriage as the union between a man and a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=About Scientology |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/07/18/Tampabay/About_Scientology.shtml |work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=2004-07-18 &lt;!-- |access-date=2006-09-02 --&gt; |access-date=2015-07-06 |archive-date=2015-07-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708072837/http://www.sptimes.com/2004/07/18/Tampabay/About_Scientology.shtml |url-status=dead |quote=Scientology Positions: Gay marriage - Scientologists recognize marriage as a part of the second of eight dynamics of existence.

Opposition to [[LGBT rights in Poland]] comes mainly from right-wing politics, such as the ruling [[Law and Justice]] party, and from the [[Catholic Church in Poland]], in which a majority of Poles are members. According to [[ILGA-Europe]]'s 2020 report, Poland ranks the lowest of European Union countries for LGBT rights. According to some opinion polls, opposition to LGBT rights has been diminishing, with support for [[civil partnerships]] rising from 52% in 2017 to 60% in 2019.

As of 2010, the largest voice against LGBT equality in the UK came from the [[Church of England]] over the issue of same-sex marriage. Labour passed into law in 2005 the ability for same-sex couples to enter civil partnerships, but they could not take place in a church or be called a "marriage". The Church of England opposed the-then coalition Government's plans (this government came to an end in May 2015) to extend this to "full marriage rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/8221964/Coalition-ministers-consider-gay-marriage-plans.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226234838/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/8221964/Coalition-ministers-consider-gay-marriage-plans.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 December 2010 |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Tim |last=Ross |title=Coalition ministers consider gay marriage plans |date=24 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:McCarthy Cohn.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph McCarthy]] and [[Roy Cohn]], leaders of the [[Lavender scare]]]]
In the 1950s in the [[United States]], open homosexuality was taboo. Legislatures in every state had passed laws against homosexual behavior well before this, most notably [[Sodomy laws in the United States|anti-sodomy laws]]. During the [[Cold War]] politicians frequently described homosexuals as "subversives" who undermined national security and patriotism, and described them as [[Fellow traveller|Communist sympathisers]] or a Communist [[Fifth column]]. During the [[Lavender Scare]], [[Joseph McCarthy]] used accusations of homosexuality as a [[smear tactic]].&lt;ref&gt;Cuordileone, K. A. "'Politics in an Age of Anxiety': Cold War Political Culture and the Crisis in American Masculinity, 1949–1960" ''The Journal of American History'' 87 (2) (2000): 515–545&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Kenneth S. Wherry|Kenneth Wherry]] publicized fears that [[Joseph Stalin]] had obtained a list of closeted homosexuals in positions of power from [[Adolf Hitler]], which he believed Stalin intended to use to blackmail these men into working against the U.S. for the Soviet regime.&lt;ref&gt;Von Hoffman, Nicholas, ''Citizen Cohn'' Doubleday, 1988, pp 130&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Hoey Report|1950 report]] produced by a Senate subcommittee titled "Employment of Homosexuals and Other Sex Perverts in Government" said that "the pervert is easy prey to the blackmailer... It is an accepted fact among intelligence agencies that espionage organizations the world over consider sex perverts who are in possession of or have access to confidential material to be prime targets where pressure can be exerted." Along with that security-based concern, the report found homosexuals unsuitable for government employment because "those who engage in overt acts of perversion lack the emotional stability of normal persons. In addition, there is an abundance of evidence to sustain the conclusion that indulgence in acts of sex perversion weakens the moral fiber of an individual to a degree that he is not suitable for a position of responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/context/employment.html|title=Who's Gay?

The modern roots of the [[Christian right]]'s views on sexual matters were evident in the years 1950s–1960s, a period in which many [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Christianity in the United States|Christians in the United States]] viewed sexual promiscuity as not only excessive, but in fact as a threat to their ideal vision of the country.&lt;ref name="Herman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Herman|first=Didi|url=https://archive.org/details/antigayagendaort00herm|title=The Antigay Agenda: Orthodox Vision and the Christian Right|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-226-32764-8|location=Chicago, IL|url-access=registration|access-date=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}}

[[File:Save Our Children From Homosexuality Brochure.jpg|thumb|upright|Brochure used by Save Our Children in 1977]]
Beginning in the 1970s, conservative Christian protests against promiscuity began to surface, largely as a reaction to the "[[Sexual revolution in 1960s United States|permissive Sixties]]" and an emerging prominence of sexual rights arising from ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and the [[LGBT rights movement]]. The Christian right proceeded to make sexuality issues a priority political cause.&lt;ref name=Herman /&gt;{{rp|28}} [[Anita Bryant]] organized [[Save Our Children]], a widespread campaign to oppose legislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of [[sexual orientation]] in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]].&lt;ref name="Fetner 2001"/&gt; The group argued that gay people were "[[Homosexual recruitment|recruiting]]" or "[[Homosexuality and pedophilia|molesting children]]" in order to make them gay.&lt;ref name="Fetner 2001"/&gt; Bryant infamously claimed that "As a mother, I know that homosexuals cannot biologically reproduce children; therefore, they must recruit our children," and also claimed that "If gays are granted rights, next we'll have to give rights to prostitutes and to people who sleep with St. Bernards and to nail biters."&lt;ref name="At Any Cost"&gt;{{cite book|title= At Any Cost|url= https://archive.org/details/atanycost0000brya|url-access= registration|last= Bryant|first=Anita |author2=Green, Bob |year= 1978|publisher= Fleming H.

Bryant's campaign attracted widespread opposition and [[boycott]]s which put her out of business and destroyed her reputation.

From the late 1970s onwards, some [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Christianity in the United States|Christian organizations]] such as the [[Christian Broadcasting Network]], [[Focus on the Family]], [[Concerned Women for America]], the [[American Family Association]], and the [[Christian Coalition of America]], along with right-wing Christian hate groups such as the [[Westboro Baptist Church]], have been outspoken against LGBT rights.&lt;ref name="Gannon 1981"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McKeegan 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller 2014"&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Steven P. |year=2014 |title=The Age of Evangelicalism: America's Born-Again Years |chapter=Left, Right, Born Again |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cWLwAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199777952.003.0003 |pages=32–59 |isbn=9780199777952 |lccn=2013037929 |oclc=881502753 |access-date=2022-07-07 |archive-date=2023-04-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230416153432/https://books.google.com/books?id=cWLwAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Durham 2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Durham |first=Martin |year=2000 |chapter=The rise of the right |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ual1NR2WPasC&amp;pg=PA1 |title=The Christian Right, the Far Right, and the Boundaries of American Conservatism |location=[[Manchester]] and [[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] |pages=1–23 |isbn=9780719054860 |access-date=2022-07-07 |archive-date=2023-04-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230416153442/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ual1NR2WPasC&amp;pg=PA1 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Late in 1979, a [[Fourth Great Awakening|new religious revival]] among conservative [[Evangelicalism in the United States|Evangelical Protestants]] and [[Catholic Church in the United States|Roman Catholics]] ushered in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican coalition]] politically aligned with the [[Christian right]] that would reign in the United States between the years 1970s and 1980s, becoming another obstacle for the progress of the [[LGBTQ rights movement]].&lt;ref name="Gannon 1981"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McKeegan 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Durham 2000"/&gt;

During the 1980s, the movement was largely dismissed by political pundits and mainstream religious leaders as "a collection of buffoonish has-beens". Later, it re-emerged, better organized and more focused, taking firm positions against abortion, pornography, sexual deviancy, and extreme feminism.&lt;ref name=Kaplan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=George R.|title=Shotgun Wedding: Notes on Public Education's Encounter with the New Christian Right|journal=Phi Delta Kappan|date=May 1994|volume=75|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Hohn|title=THE VALUES CAMPAIGN?

Influential Christian right organizations were at the forefront of the anti-gay rights movement in the United States in the 1990s and 2000s, including Focus on the Family, Family Research Council, and the [[Family Research Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Draper |first1=Electa |title=Focus on the Family focuses on homosexuals |url=https://www.denverpost.com/2008/10/22/focus-on-the-family-focuses-on-homosexuals/ |website=Denver Post |date=22 October 2008 |access-date=7 June 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Herman /&gt;{{rp|15–16}} An important stratagem in Christian right anti-gay politics is in its rejection of "the edicts of a Big Brother" state, allowing it to profit from "a general feeling of discontent and demoralization with government". As a result, the Christian right has endorsed smaller government, restricting its ability to arbitrate in disputes regarding values and traditions. In this context, gay rights laws have come to symbolize the government's allegedly unconstitutional "[interference] with individual freedom".&lt;ref name=Herman /&gt;{{rp|170–171}}

The central tenets of Focus on the Family and similar organizations, such as the Family Research Council, emphasise issues such as abortion and the necessity of gender roles. A number of organizations, including the New Christian Right, "have in various ways rejected liberal America in favor of the regulation of pornography, anti-abortion legislation, the criminalization of homosexuality, and the virtues of faithfulness and loyalty in sexual partnerships", according to sociologist [[Bryan S.

Numerous studies have investigated the prevalence of acceptance and disapproval of homosexuality and have consistently found correlations with various demographic, psychological, and social variables. For example, studies (mainly conducted in the United States) have found that heterosexuals with positive attitudes towards homosexuality are more likely to be non-religious, politically liberal or moderate, young, female and have close personal contact with [[coming out|openly]] gay men and lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;Studies finding that heterosexual men usually exhibit more hostile attitudes toward gay men and lesbians than heterosexual women:

{{Main|Don't ask, don't tell}}

Homosexual activity was a reason for expulsion from the United States Armed Forces from their very beginning, although that was not codified until 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/USA0103.pdf |title=Uniform Discrimination: The "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" Policy of the U.S. Military |date=2003 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |access-date=May 13, 2021 |archive-date=February 5, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205150317/https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/USA0103.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]" (DADT) policy that began in 1994 barred the military from questioning people about their sexual orientation, but maintained the barring of service members who had [[coming out|come out]]. The barring of homosexuals was removed altogether in December 2010 by President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Study: Military gays don't undermine unit|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/25575198/|access-date=5 July 2015|work=NBC News|publisher=Associated Press|date=7 July 2008|archive-date=1 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601101555/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/25575198/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before [[Don't ask, don't tell#History|DADT was established]], advocates for allowing gay people to [[Sexual orientation and military service|openly serve]] pointed out that neither [[unit cohesion]] nor morale were affected when the [[United Kingdom|UK]] admitted gay people into the military. A similar comparison has been made to the lack of negative consequences when African-Americans and women were admitted into the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/out_in_force.html|title=Out In Force|work=ucdavis.edu|access-date=2008-11-19|archive-date=2008-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012215147/http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/Rainbow/html/out_in_force.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Boy Scouts of America ====
{{further|Boy Scouts of America membership controversies#Position on homosexuality}}
 {{Update|Boy Scouts of America|date=November 2018}}

The [[Boy Scouts of America]] excludes gay and bisexual people from its organizations, an exclusion enforced commonly for Scoutmasters, but also for scouts in leadership positions. Their rationale is that homosexuality is immoral and that Scouts are expected to have certain [[moral]] standards and values, as the [[Scout Oath]] and [[Scout Law]] requires boys to be "morally straight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/BoyScouts.aspx |title=Boy Scouts |publisher=Scouting.org |access-date=21 August 2013 |archive-date=24 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524194043/http://www.scouting.org/BoyScouts.aspx |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Boy Scout organization does not view their policy as unjustly [[discriminatory]], but instead defends their policy saying that, "Tolerance for diversity of values does not require abdication of one's own values".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scouting.org/media/positions/unitedway.html|title=Position statements: United Way|author=The Boy Scouts of America|work=scouting.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021016025135/http://www.scouting.org/media/positions/unitedway.html|archive-date=16 October 2002|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in [[Boy Scouts of America v. Dale]] that the Boy Scouts of America is a [[Club (organization)|private organization]], and as such can decide its own membership rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2000/LAW/06/28/scotus.gay.boyscouts/ |title=Supreme Court says Boy Scouts can bar gay troop leaders |work=CNN |access-date=2020-06-29 |archive-date=2020-01-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128184911/http://edition.cnn.com/2000/LAW/06/28/scotus.gay.boyscouts/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is still a movement to try to persuade the organization to change its policy or allow local chapters to decide for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoutingforall.org/data/layer02/mission.html|title=Scouting for All: Committed to Scouting, Open to Diversity.

In 2005, the [[U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Support Our Scouts Act]] of 2005 to exempt the BSA from anti-discrimination laws, to require the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] to support scouting [[National Scout jamboree (Boy Scouts of America)|Jamboree]]s (thus rendering ineffective a Federal Court injunction prohibiting this as an [[unconstitutional]] [[establishment of religion]] in violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]) and to require [[U.S. state|state]] or local governments that receive Community Development Block Grant money from the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|Department of Housing and Urban Development]] to allow BSA to have meetings in their facilities or on their property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bsalegal.org/support-our-scouts-act-of-2005-261.asp |title=Support our scouts act of 2005 |publisher=BSALegal.org |date=30 December 2005 |access-date=21 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130112130516/http://www.bsalegal.org/support-our-scouts-act-of-2005-261.asp |archive-date=12 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BSA receives much of its funding and support from religious groups noted for their opposition to the [[gay rights movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two-year anniversary of Supreme Court case|url=http://www.religionlink.org/tip_020624b.php|website=religionlink.org|access-date=4 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416213806/http://www.religionlink.org/tip_020624b.php|archive-date=16 April 2009|date=24 June 2002|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some BSA local councils found that [[United Way of America|United Way]]'s, municipalities', school districts' and businesses' support and funding was reduced because of their adherence to the BSA's policy on sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ffrf.org/timely/bsa.php|title=Boy Scouts Of America Practices Discrimination|publisher=Freedom From Religion Foundation|access-date=9 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050207120637/http://ffrf.org/timely/bsa.php|archive-date=7 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to continue receiving funding, local councils like New Jersey signed nondiscrimination agreements contrary to BSA National Council policy.&lt;ref name="jersey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/njcouncil.html|title=United Way to Continue Aid to Central Jersey Scouts|work=NY Times|date=31 August 2001|access-date=3 November 2006|archive-date=26 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235709/http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/njcouncil.html|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambdalegal.org/cgi-bin/iowa/news/fact.html?record=1325|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626123129/http://www.lambdalegal.org/cgi-bin/iowa/news/fact.html?record=1325|title=The Impact of the Boy Scouts of America's Anti-Gay Discrimination|archive-date=26 June 2006|work=lambdalegal.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other outdoor-focused, youth-based organizations such as the [[4-H]] club and [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] do not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.

In most countries where Boy Scouts organizations exist homosexuality is not regarded as incompatible with scout values, and gay members are not excluded from activities;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoutingforall.org/data/layer02/international.html|title=Scouting for All: Committed to Scouting, Open to Diversity.
