An example of second-generation gender bias is that leaders are expected to be assertive, so that women who act in a more collaborative fashion are not viewed as leaders, but women who do act assertively are often perceived as too aggressive.&lt;ref name=Carter1May2011&gt;Sherrie Bourg Carter, [https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/high-octane-women/201105/the-invisible-barrier-second-generation-gender-discrimination "The Invisible Barrier: Second Generation Gender Discrimination"], ''Psychology Today'', 1 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of bias, or gender stereotyping, can be entirely unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;Rita Gardiner, ''Gender, Authenticity and Leadership'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2015, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=60gTBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52 52].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workplace discrimination==
Second-generation gender bias is a form of [[discrimination against women]] because their practices reflect the values of the men who created the setting, which is often the workplace. Gender bias is one of the most regularly appearing biases shown in the workplace, as opposed to [[racist]] bias or personal bias.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=1&amp;sid=00f460a3-97ee-47ae-8627-253d286d02ee%2540sessionmgr110&amp;hid=120&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%253d%253d#AN=103435512&amp;db=bth&lt;/ref&gt; Few people in workplaces with gender diversity recognize it as a problem, and many people, including those who work in single-gender workplaces, are not aware it is happening at all.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://hbr.org/2013/09/women-rising-the-unseen-barriers|title = Women Rising: The Unseen Barriers|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of second-generation gender bias is that in some work places, women are not being hired because the company is a male-dominated workplace.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Educate Everyone About Second-Generation Gender Bias|url = https://hbr.org/2013/08/educate-everyone-about-second/|website = Harvard Business Review|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work cultures may be created to appear to be neutral and unbiased, but they are not.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Second-generation gender bias truly shows the unseen truth that women are discriminated against by men.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.csemag.com/single-article/second-generation-bias-a-subtle-but-powerful-presence/01eed77302fb4d68777fc9821ea55752.html|title = Second Generation Gender Bias, A Subtle but Powerful Presence|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Guy|first = Sandra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faye Crosby argues that second-generation gender bias goes unnoticed in the workplace not only by men, but also by women.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Many women experience second-generation gender bias in the workplace, but fail to even notice that such discrimination is happening.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Women who do recognize second-generation gender bias may feel more power-driven, rather than taken advantage of, when thinking of the discriminatory acts that she has experienced in the past.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; According to [[Herminia Ibarra]], women recognizing these discriminatory acts makes the women feel empowered to push themselves to achieve leadership opportunities that she is qualified for and exceed the expectations of herself in order to be more successful than the males in the workplace.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Masculine traits, such as strong, confident, and definitive, are typically preferred in the workplace because they make the company appear to be more driven and confident in its success.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, when a woman shows these "masculine traits", she is often thought of as bossy, rude, and full of herself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Experts say that men are more of the natural-born leaders because of their biological preferences.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Women could be strong leaders as well because they can be compassionate towards those under them, which, in turn, could result in better relationships and stronger teams.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Another specific example of second-generation bias is how in some places, companies are having trouble keeping women engineers as employees.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; These women are not staying in their field because of their low self-esteem in regards to failing in front of their mostly male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; These women may feel intimidated and outnumbered by the males in the workplace, causing them to fear failing while being watched by an audience that is majority male-dominant.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; If there wasn't such discrimination in the workplace regarding women in charge and working in a place full of men, studies show that women would not have such low self-esteem, and they would possibly continue to try their best to succeed in their field. This behavior of women is sometimes unconscious and is caused because of this second-generation gender bias.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

While women are attending college and earning degrees now more than ever, statistics show that women are not advancing in school like men are. There has been an increase in number of women that are receiving their doctorates, but the increase does not correspond with the amount of women that are becoming professors and high level positions, such as president.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Many people believe discrimination ended in the mid '60s, when campaigns for ending discrimination still exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Global Campaign for Equal Nationality Rights|url = http://equalnationalityrights.org|website = equalnationalityrights.org|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sandra Bem]] (1981) made known the [[gender schema theory]], which explains how an individual's sex identity is essential to the culture in which one is brought up. These ideas are still interfering with women from advancing into society. [[Meyerson]] and Fletcher (2000) propose that gender discrimination will never go away, it has just "gone underground."

The main difference between first-generation gender bias and second-generation gender bias is whether or not it is intentional.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Invisible Barrier: Second Generation Gender Discrimination|url = https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/high-octane-women/201105/the-invisible-barrier-second-generation-gender-discrimination|website = Psychology Today|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In first-generation gender bias, one intentionally discriminates against another, whereas in second-generation gender bias, the discrimination is not intentional.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

== Possible solutions ==
Ending this second-generation gender bias is hard because men and women alike do not realize discrimination is taking place, or deny that it is occurring.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Because this problem is over-looked so frequently, it is not recognized as a major problem in many workplaces. One example of a solution could be as easy as using initials instead of a full name to hide [[gender bias]] when applying for employment in the workplace. Although this would not change the bias entirely, it would make employers review the resumes without paying attention to gender. Budden et al. (2007) proved that when women were judged by their work blindly, the number of women hired increased.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
