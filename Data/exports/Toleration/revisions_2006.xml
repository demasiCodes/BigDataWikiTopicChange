'''Religious toleration''' is the condition of accepting or permitting others' [[religion|religious]] beliefs and practices which disagree with one's own.

In a country with a [[state religion]], ''toleration'' means that the government permits religious practices of other sects besides the state religion, and does not persecute believers in other faiths. Historically, toleration has been a contentious issue within many religions as well as between one religion and another. At issue is not merely whether other faiths should be permitted, but also whether a ruler who is a believer may practice or permit tolerance. In the [[Middle Ages]], toleration of [[Judaism]] was a contentious issue throughout [[Christendom]]. Today, there are concerns about toleration of [[Christianity]] in [[Islamic law|Islamic states]] (see also [[dhimmi]]).

For individuals, religious toleration generally means an attitude of acceptance towards other people's religions. It does not mean that one views other religions as equally true; merely that others have the right to hold and practice their beliefs. [[Proselytism]] can be a contentious issue; it can be regarded as an offense against the validity of others' religions, or as an expression of one's own faith.
