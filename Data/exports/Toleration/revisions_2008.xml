'''Religious toleration''' is the condition of accepting or permitting others' [[religion|religious]] beliefs and practices which disagree with one's own.

In a country with a [[state religion]], ''toleration'' means that the government permits religious practices of other sects besides the state religion, and does not persecute believers in other faiths. It is a partial status, and might still be accompanied by forms of [[religious discrimination]]. Religious toleration as a Government policy merely means the absence of [[religious persecution]]; unlike [[religious liberty]] it does not mean that religions are equal before the law. Toleration is a [[privilege]] granted by Government (which it may do by law or charter), not a [[right]] against it; governments have often tolerated some religions and not others.   

Religious toleration "as a government-sanctioned practice — the sense on which most discussion of the phenomenon relies —
is not attested before the sixteenth century", which makes it rather difficult to apply the concept to topics like [[Persecution of religion in ancient Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;H.A.Drake, ''Lambs into Lions: explaining early Christian intolerance'', Past and Present 153 (1996), p.8, [http://past.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/153/1/3 Oxford Journals] &lt;/ref&gt; 

Historically, toleration has been a contentious issue within many religions as well as between one religion and another. At issue is not merely whether other faiths should be permitted, but also whether a ruler who is a believer may be tolerant, or permit his subordinates to be. In the [[Middle Ages]], toleration of [[Judaism]] was a contentious issue throughout [[Christendom]]. Today, there are concerns about toleration of [[Christianity]] in [[Sharia|Islamic states]] (see also [[dhimmi]]).

[[Proselytism]] can be a contentious issue; it can be regarded as an offence against the validity of others' religions, or as an expression of one's own faith.

==The element of objection== 

For individuals, religious toleration generally means an attitude of acceptance towards other people's religions. It does not mean that one views other religions as equally true; merely that others have the right to hold and practice their beliefs. This element of objection is important. People, who take these matters seriously, often experience distress when they are confronted with religious beliefs that they regard as idolatrous, [[Superstition|superstitious]], [[Heresy|heretical]] or [[Schism (religion)|schismatic]]. 

==Contexts of religious tolerance== 

At least five contexts of religious tolerance can be distinguished. Religious tolerance as a state sanctioned practice can more precisely termed ''civil tolerance''. Civil tolerance is concerned with "the policy of the state towards religious dissent".&lt;ref&gt;Coffey 2000: 11&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to this, ecclesiastical tolerance is concerned with the degree of diversity tolerated within a particular church.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey 2000: 12&lt;/ref&gt; Without this distinction, the [[Christian debate on persecution and toleration]] in England could not be adequately understood.   

Furthermore, there is also a ''social'' and a ''polemical'' context of religious tolerance. The grand theme of ''divine tolerance'' is the emphasis on "the patience and longsuffering of God" as it is frequently portrayed in the Christian [[Bible]]; This image of God has been invoked by early Christian advocates of toleration.  

===The polemical context===

Contemporary authors such as [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Daniel C. Dennett]] have all challenged the tolerance of religion. In ''[[The End of Faith]]'', Sam Harris asserts that we should be unwilling to tolerate unjustified beliefs about morality, spirituality, politics, and the origin of humanity. In his [[preface]] to ''[[The God Delusion]]'', Richard Dawkins says, "If this book works as I intend, religious readers who open it will be atheists when they put it down."&lt;ref name="preface"&gt;Dawkins, Richard. [http://www.randomhouse.com.au/Downloads/News/GodDelusion_extract_revised.pdf Preface] ''The God Delusion''.&lt;/ref&gt;
