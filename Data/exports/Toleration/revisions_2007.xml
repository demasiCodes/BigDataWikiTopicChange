'''Religious toleration''' is the condition of accepting or permitting others' [[religion|religious]] beliefs and practices which disagree with one's own.

In a country with a [[state religion]], ''toleration'' means that the government permits religious practices of other sects besides the state religion, and does not persecute believers in other faiths. Historically, toleration has been a contentious issue within many religions as well as between one religion and another. At issue is not merely whether other faiths should be permitted, but also whether a ruler who is a believer may practice or permit tolerance. In the [[Middle Ages]], toleration of [[Judaism]] was a contentious issue throughout [[Christendom]]. Today, there are concerns about toleration of [[Christianity]] in [[Sharia|Islamic states]] (see also [[dhimmi]]).

For individuals, religious toleration generally means an attitude of acceptance towards other people's religions. It does not mean that one views other religions as equally true; merely that others have the right to hold and practice their beliefs. [[Proselytism]] can be a contentious issue; it can be regarded as an offense against the validity of others' religions, or as an expression of one's own faith.

==Criticism==
{{main|Religious intolerance}}
Contemporary authors such as [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Daniel C. Dennett]] have all written about the potential social hazards of allowing religious beliefs to go unchallenged. In ''[[The End of Faith]]'', Sam Harris notes that we are unwilling, as a society, to tolerate unjustified beliefs in, for example, architecture. He asserts that we should be similarly unwilling to tolerate unjustified beliefs about morality, spirituality, politics, and the origin of humanity.  In his [[preface]] to ''[[The God Delusion]]'', Richard Dawkins says, "If this book works as I intend, religious readers who open it will be atheists when they put it down."&lt;ref name="preface"&gt;Dawkins, Richard. [http://www.randomhouse.com.au/Downloads/News/GodDelusion_extract_revised.pdf Preface] ''The God Delusion''.&lt;/ref&gt;
