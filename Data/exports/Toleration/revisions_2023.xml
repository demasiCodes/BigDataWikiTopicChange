'''Toleration''' is when one allows, permits, or [[acceptance|accepts]] an action, idea, object, or person that one dislikes or disagrees with.

Political scientist Andrew R. Murphy explains that "We can improve our understanding by defining 'toleration' as a set of social or political practices and 'tolerance' as a set of attitudes."&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Murphy |first=Andrew R. |year=1997 |title=Tolerance, Toleration, and the Liberal Tradition |journal=Polity |publisher=The University of Chicago Press Journals |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=593–623 |doi=10.2307/3235269 |jstor=3235269 |s2cid=155764374}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Random House Dictionary]]'' defines tolerance as "a fair, objective, and permissive attitude toward those whose opinions, beliefs, practices, racial or ethnic origins, etc., differ from one's own".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Definition of tolerance|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/tolerance |access-date=2 January 2023 |website=dictionary.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both these concepts contain the idea of [[alterity]]—the state of ''otherness''.&lt;ref name="van Doorn"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=van Doorn |first=Marjoka |year= 2014 |title=The nature of tolerance and the social circumstances in which it emerges |volume=62 |number=6|pages=905–927 |journal=Current Sociology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional choices of how to respond to the "other," beyond toleration, exist. Therefore, in some instances, toleration has been seen as "a flawed virtue" because it concerns acceptance of things that were better overcome.{{r|van Doorn}} Toleration cannot, therefore, be defined as a universal good, and many of its applications and uses remain contested.{{r|van Doorn|page=2}}

[[Religious toleration]] may signify "no more than forbearance and the permission given by the adherents of a dominant religion for other religions to exist, even though the latter are looked on with disapproval as inferior, mistaken, or harmful".&lt;ref name="Zagorin"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Zagorin |first=Perez |title=How the Idea of Religious Toleration Came to the West |year=2003 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-09270-6 |location=Princeton, N.J. |oclc=50982270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, most incidents and writings pertaining to religious toleration involve the status of [[minority influence|minority]] and dissenting viewpoints in relation to a dominant [[state religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Vahland |first=Joachim |year=2017 |title=Tolerance discourses |magazine=Zeno |issue=37 |pages=7–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, religion is also sociological, and the practice of toleration has always had a political aspect as well.&lt;ref name="Gervers"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Tolerance and Intolerance: Social Conflict in the Age of the Crusades |publisher=Syracuse University Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8156-2869-9 |editor-last=Gervers |editor-first=Peter |editor-last2=Gervers |editor-first2=Michael |editor-last3=Powell |editor-first3=James M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xiii}}

Toleration assumes a conflict over something important that cannot be resolved through normal negotiation without resorting to war or violence.{{cn|reason=can't I be tolerant of e.g. my bunkmate's snoring or my co-worker's bad jokes?|date=August 2023}} As political lecturer Catriona McKinnon explains, when it comes to questions like what is "the best way to live, the right things to think, the ideal political society, or the true road to salvation, no amount of negotiation and bargaining will bring them to an agreement without at least one party relinquishing the commitments that created the conflict in the first place. Such conflicts provide the circumstances of toleration... [and] are endemic in society."&lt;ref name="McKinnon"&gt;{{Cite book |last=McKinnon |first=Catriona |title=Toleration: A Critical Introduction |publisher=Routledge |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-415-32289-8 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} "The urgency and relevance of this issue is only too obvious: without tolerance, communities that value diversity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Diversity As A Core Value – What Does It Mean To Value Diversity? |url=https://www.emexmag.com/diversity-as-a-core-value/ |access-date=10 June 2016 |website=emexmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; equality, and peace could not persist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogt|first=W.P.|year=1997|title=Tolerance &amp; Education: Learning to Live with Diversity and Difference|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|van Doorn|page=1}}

An examination of the history of toleration includes its practice across various cultures. Toleration has evolved into a guiding principle, finding contemporary relevance in politics, society, religion, and ethnicity. It also applies to minority groups, including [[LGBT]] individuals. It is closely linked to concepts like [[human rights]].

==Etymology==
Originally from the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|tolerans}} ([[present participle]] of {{lang|la|tolerare}}; "to bear, endure, tolerate"), the word {{lang|frm|tolerance}} was first used in [[Middle French]] in the 14th century and in [[Early Modern English]] in the early 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=tolerance (n.) |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/tolerance#etymonline_v_15343 |access-date=19 November 2018 |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''toleration'' was first used in English in the 1510s to mean "permission granted by authority, licence" from the French {{lang|fr|tolération}} (originally from the Latin [[past participle]] stem of {{lang|la|tolerare}}, {{lang|la|tolerationem}}), moving towards the meaning of "forbearance, sufferance" in the 1580s.&lt;ref name="toleration (n.)"&gt;{{Cite web |title=toleration (n.) |work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/toleration#etymonline_v_15344 |access-date=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of religious toleration stems from [[Sebastian Castellio]]&lt;ref name="Zagorin" /&gt; and the [[Toleration Act 1688]].&lt;ref name="toleration (n.)" /&gt;

==Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen==
[[File:Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789.jpg|thumb|[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]]]
{{quote box|quote=For having lived long, I have experienced many instances of being obliged, by better information or fuller consideration, to change opinions even on important subjects, which I once thought right but found to be otherwise. It is, therefore, that the older I grow, the more apt I am to doubt my judgment and to pay more respect to the judgment of others.|source=[[Benjamin Franklin]]|width=20em}}
The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] (1789), adopted by the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] during the [[French Revolution]], states in Article 10: "No-one shall be interfered with for his opinions, even religious ones, provided that their practice does not disturb public order as established by the law." ("{{lang|fr|Nul ne doit être inquiété pour ses opinions, mêmes religieuses, pourvu que leur manifestation ne trouble pas l'ordre public établi par la loi.}}")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Déclaration des droits de l'Homme et du citoyen de 1789 |url=https://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/le-bloc-de-constitutionnalite/declaration-des-droits-de-l-homme-et-du-citoyen-de-1789 |language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the nineteenth century==
===Mill===
In "[[On Liberty]]" (1859) [[John Stuart Mill]] concludes that opinions ought never to be suppressed, stating, "Such prejudice, or oversight, when it [i.e. false belief] occurs, is altogether an evil; but it is one from which we cannot hope to be always exempt, and must be regarded as the price paid for an inestimable good."&lt;ref name=Mill&gt;{{cite book|last=Mill|first=John Stuart|title=On Liberty|location=London|publisher=John W. Parker and Son|year=1859|url=https://archive.org/details/onlibertyxero00milluoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|[https://archive.org/details/onlibertyxero00milluoft/page/93/mode/1up 93]}} He claims that there are three sorts of beliefs that can be had—wholly false, partly true, and wholly true—all of which, according to Mill, benefit the common good:

{{quote|First, if any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, for aught we can certainly know, be true. To deny this is to assume our infallibility. Secondly, though the silenced opinion is an error, it may, and very commonly does, contain a portion of truth; and since the general or prevailing opinion on any subject is rarely or never the whole truth, it is only by the collision of adverse opinions that the remainder of the truth has any chance of being supplied. Thirdly, even if the received opinion is not only true but the whole truth; unless it is suffered to be, and is, vigorously and earnestly contested, it will, by most of those who receive it, be held in the manner of a prejudice, with little comprehension or feeling of its rational grounds. Not only this, but, fourthly, the meaning of the doctrine itself will be in danger of being lost, or enfeebled, and deprived of its vital effect on the character and conduct: the dogma becoming a mere formal profession, inefficacious for good, but cumbering the ground, and preventing the growth of any real and heartfelt conviction, from reason or personal experience.{{r|Mill|page=[https://archive.org/details/onlibertyxero00milluoft/page/95/mode/1up 95]}} }}

===Renan===
[[File:Ernest Renan 1876-84.jpg|thumb|Renan]]
In his 1882 essay "[[What is a Nation?]]", French historian and philosopher [[Ernest Renan]] proposed a definition of nationhood based on "a spiritual principle" involving shared memories rather than a common religious, racial, or linguistic heritage. Thus members of any religious group could participate fully in the nation's life. "You can be French, English, German, yet Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, or practicing no religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Renan |first=Ernest |date=11 March 1882 |title='What is a nation?' Conference at the Sorbonne |url=http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Qu%E2%80%99est-ce_qu%E2%80%99une_nation_%3F |access-date=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the twentieth century==
In 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], which states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |year=1948 |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights |url=https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights |access-date=1 June 2007 |publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Though not formally legally binding, the Declaration has been adopted in or has influenced many national constitutions since 1948. It also serves as the foundation for a growing number of international treaties and national laws and international, regional, national, and sub-national institutions protecting and promoting human rights, including the [[freedom of religion]].

==Modern analyses and critiques==
Contemporary commentators have highlighted situations in which toleration conflicts with widely held moral standards, national law, the principles of national identity, or other strongly held goals. Michael Walzer notes that the British in India tolerated the Hindu practice of [[suttee]] (ritual burning of a widow) until 1829. On the other hand, the United States declined to tolerate the [[Mormon]] practice of [[polygamy]].&lt;ref name=Walzer&gt;{{Cite book |last=Walzer |first=Michael |url=https://archive.org/details/ontoleration00walz_0 | url-access=registration |title=On Toleration|series=The Castle lectures in ethics, politics, and economics |year=1997 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0300070195 |location=New Haven |oclc=47008086}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Islamic veil controversy in France|French head scarf controversy]] represents a conflict between religious practice and the French secular ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Bowen |first=John |date=February–March 2004 |title=Muslims and Citizens |url=https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/john-r-bowen-muslims-and-citizens/ |magazine=The Boston Review |access-date=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toleration of or intolerance toward the [[Romani people]] in European countries is a continuing issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=A long road |newspaper=The Economist |url=https://www.economist.com/international/2010/09/16/a-long-road|url-access=subscription|date=2010-09-18 |access-date=2 January 2023 |issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern definition===
Historian Alexandra Walsham notes that the modern understanding of the word "toleration" may be very different from its historic meaning.&lt;ref name="Walsham06-233"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Walsham |first=Alexandra |title=Charitable Hatred: Tolerance and Intolerance in England, 1500–1700 |year=2006 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-5239-2 |location=Manchester |page=233 |oclc=62533086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toleration in modern parlance has been analyzed as a component of a liberal or [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] view of human rights. Hans Oberdiek writes, "As long as no one is harmed or no one's fundamental rights are violated, the state should keep hands off, tolerating what those controlling the state find disgusting, deplorable, or debased. For a long time, this has been the most prevalent defense of toleration by liberals... It is found, for example, in the writings of American philosophers [[John Rawls]], [[Robert Nozick]], [[Ronald Dworkin]], [[Brian Barry]], and a Canadian, [[Will Kymlicka]], among others."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Oberdiek |first=Hans |title=Tolerance: Between Forbearance and Acceptance |year=2001 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers |isbn=978-0-8476-8785-5 |location=Lanham, Md. |page=vi |oclc=45604024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaiah Berlin]] attributes to [[Herbert Butterfield]] the notion that "toleration{{nbsp}}... implies a certain disrespect. I tolerate your absurd beliefs and your foolish acts, though I know them to be absurd and foolish. Mill would, I think, have agreed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Berlin |first=Isaiah |title=Four Essays on Liberty |date=1969 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-500272-0 |location=London |oclc=15227}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2023}}

[[John Gray (philosopher)|John Gray]] states that "When we tolerate a practice, a belief or a character trait, we let something be that we judge to be undesirable, false, or at least inferior; our toleration expresses the conviction that, despite its badness, the object of toleration should be left alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=John |first=Gray |title=Enlightenment's Wake: Politics and Culture at the Close of the Modern Age |publisher=Routledge |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-138-17022-3 |oclc=941437450}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Gray, "new liberalism – the
liberalism of Rawls, Dworkin, Ackerman and suchlike" – seems to imply that "it is wrong for government to discriminate in favour of, or against, any form of life animated by a definite conception of the good".&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1995), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Rawls]]' "theory of 'political liberalism' conceives of toleration as a pragmatic response to the fact of diversity". Diverse groups learn to tolerate one another by developing "what Rawls calls 'overlapping consensus': individuals and groups with diverse metaphysical views or 'comprehensive schemes' will find reasons to agree about certain principles of justice that will include principles of toleration".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web |first=Andrew|last=Fiala|title=Toleration| website = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=https://iep.utm.edu/tolerati/ |access-date=2 January 2023 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Marcuse]], in the 1965 book ''[[A Critique of Pure Tolerance]]'', argued that "pure tolerance" that permits all can favor [[totalitarianism]] and [[tyranny of the majority]], and insisted on "repressive tolerance" against them.{{cn|date=September 2023}}

===Tolerating the intolerant===
{{main article|Paradox of tolerance}}
Walzer, [[Karl Popper]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Popper |first=Karl |title=The Open Society and Its Enemies |isbn=978-0-691-21206-7 |volume=1 |chapter=chapter 7, note 4 |oclc=1193010976}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Rawls]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rawls |first=John |title=A Theory of Justice: Original Edition |year=1971 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-01772-6 |language=en|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TdvHKizvuTAC&amp;pg=PA216 216]}}&lt;/ref&gt; have discussed the paradox of tolerating intolerance. Walzer asks "Should we tolerate the intolerant?" He notes that most minority religious groups who are the beneficiaries of tolerance are themselves intolerant, at least in some respects.{{r|Walzer|pages=80–81}} Rawls argues that an intolerant sect should be tolerated in a tolerant society unless the sect directly threatens the security of other members of the society. He links this principle to the stability of a tolerant society, in which members of an intolerant sect in a tolerant society will, over time, acquire the tolerance of the wider society.

===Other criticisms and issues===
Toleration has been described as undermining itself via [[moral relativism]]: "either the claim self-referentially undermines itself or it provides us with no compelling reason to believe it. If we are skeptical about knowledge, then we have no way of knowing that toleration is good."&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

[[Ronald Dworkin]] argues that in exchange for toleration, minorities must bear with the criticisms and insults which are part of the freedom of speech in an otherwise tolerant society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Dworkin |first=Ronald |date=14 February 2006 |title=Even bigots and Holocaust deniers must have their say |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/14/muhammadcartoons.comment |access-date=2 January 2023 |website=The Guardian |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dworkin has also questioned whether the United States is a "tolerant secular" nation, or is re-characterizing itself as a "tolerant religious" nation, based on the increasing re-introduction of religious themes into conservative politics. Dworkin concludes that "the tolerant secular model is preferable, although he invited people to use the concept of personal responsibility to argue in favor of the tolerant religious model."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=18 April 2008 |title=Dworkin Explores Secular, Religious Models for Society |url=http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/news/2006_spr/dworkin.htm |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118151728/http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/news/2006_spr/dworkin.htm|archive-date=2012-01-18|access-date=21 March 2011 |website=Virginia Law School News and Events}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The End of Faith]]'', [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] asserts that society should be unwilling to tolerate unjustified religious beliefs about morality, spirituality, politics, and the origin of humanity, especially beliefs that promote violence.
