A government displays '''religious toleration''' (or '''religious tolerance''') when it legally permits or does not interfere with religious activities associated with sects other than than the [[state religion]].  A group (or individual) displays religious toleration (or religious tolerance) when it does not oppose by force, does not oppose by rhetoric, or actively supports religious beliefs or activities of which it is not a part.  Religious tolerance does not mean one must view any or all other religions as equally valid to theirs but simply that one accepts other's right to hold religious beliefs different from one's own and practice their religion as they see fit, within reason.
