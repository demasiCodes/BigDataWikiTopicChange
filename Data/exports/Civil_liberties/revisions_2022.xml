{{short description|Civil rights and freedoms that provide individual specific rights}}
{{Rights}}
'''Civil liberties''' are guarantees and freedoms that governments commit not to abridge, either by [[constitution]], [[legislation]], or [[judicial interpretation]], without [[due process]]. Though the scope of the term differs between countries, civil liberties may include the [[Freedom of thought|freedom of conscience]], [[Freedom of the press|freedom of press]], [[freedom of religion]], [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], [[freedom of assembly]], the right to security and [[liberty]], [[freedom of speech]], the [[right to privacy]], the right to [[Equality before the law|equal treatment under the law]] and due process, the [[right to a fair trial]], and the [[right to life]]. Other civil liberties include the [[Right to property|right to own property]], the [[Self-defense|right to defend oneself]], and the right to [[bodily integrity]]. Within the distinctions between civil liberties and other types of liberty, distinctions exist between [[positive liberty]]/[[Negative and positive rights|positive rights]] and [[negative liberty]]/[[Negative and positive rights|negative rights]].

==Overview==
[[File:Li-ber-ty.jpg|thumb| upright|Broken Liberty: [[Istanbul]] Archaeology Museum]]
Many contemporary nations have a [[constitution]], a [[bill of rights]], or similar constitutional documents that enumerate and seek to guarantee civil liberties. Other nations have enacted similar laws through a variety of legal means, including signing and ratifying or otherwise giving effect to key conventions such as the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. The existence of some claimed civil liberties is a matter of dispute, as are the extent of most [[civil rights]]. Controversial examples include [[property rights]], [[reproductive rights]], and [[civil marriage]]. In authoritarian regimes in which government censorship impedes on perceived civil liberties, some civil liberty advocates argue for the use of anonymity tools to allow for free speech, privacy, and anonymity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghappour|first=Ahmed|date=2017-09-01|title=Data Collection and the Regulatory State|url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/255|journal=Connecticut Law Review|volume=49|issue=5|pages=1733}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree to which democracies acknowledge civil liberties is affected by the influence of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Lance Y.|date=2015-09-18|title=Terrorism, Civil Liberties, and Political Rights: A Cross-National Analysis|journal=Studies in Conflict &amp; Terrorism|language=en|volume=39|issue=2|pages=165–193|doi=10.1080/1057610x.2015.1084165|s2cid=110482777|issn=1057-610X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the existence of [[victimless crime]]s infringes upon civil liberties is also a matter of dispute. Another matter of debate is the suspension or alteration of certain civil liberties in times of [[war]] or [[state of emergency]], including whether and to what extent this should occur.

The formal concept of civil liberties is often dated back to [[Magna Carta]], an English legal [[charter]] agreed in 1215 which in turn was based on pre-existing documents, namely the [[Charter of Liberties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Hugh Starkey, Professor of Citizenship and Human Rights Education at UCL Institute of Education, London|title=Magna Carta and Human rights legislation|url=https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/human-rights-legislation|publisher=British Library|access-date=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
{{main article|Civil liberties in the People's Republic of China}}
The [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] (which applies only to [[mainland China]], not to [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], and [[Taiwan]]) especially its Fundamental Rights and Duties of Citizens, claims to protect many civil liberties. Taiwan, which is separated from Mainland China, has its own Constitution.

Although the 1982 constitution guarantees civil liberties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/constitution/constitution.html|title=Constitution of the People's Republic of China|access-date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Government of China|Chinese government]] usually uses the "[[Inciting subversion of state power|subversion of state power]]" and "protection of [[Classified information|state secret]]s" clauses in their law system to imprison those who criticize the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) and the [[List of national leaders of the People's Republic of China|state leaders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSPEK10194620080403|title=China jails rights activist outspoken on Tibet |work=Reuters | date=3 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fundamental Rights{{snd}}embodied in Part III of the constitution{{snd}}guarantee liberties such that all Indians can lead their lives in peace as citizens of India. The six fundamental rights are right to equality, right to freedom, right against exploitation, right to freedom of religion, cultural and educational rights and right to constitutional remedies.&lt;ref name=constpartIII&gt;[[s:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Fundamental Rights]].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dyfikolkata (54).jpg|thumb|left|Huge rallies like this one in [[Kolkata]] are commonplace in [[India]].]]
These include individual rights common to most [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]], incorporated in the fundamental law of the land and are enforceable in a court of law. Violations of these rights result in punishments as prescribed in the [[Indian Penal Code]], subject to discretion of the [[judiciary]]. These rights are neither absolute nor immune from constitutional amendments. They have been aimed at overturning the inequalities of pre-independence social practices. Specifically, they resulted in abolishment of un-touchability and prohibit [[discrimination]] on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. They forbid [[human trafficking]] and [[unfree labour]]. They protect cultural and educational rights of ethnic and religious [[minorities]] by allowing them to preserve their languages and administer their own educational institutions.

All people, irrespective of race, religion, caste or sex, have the right to approach the [[High Courts of India|High Courts]] or the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] for the enforcement of their fundamental rights. It is not necessary that the aggrieved party has to be the one to do so. In public interest, anyone can initiate litigation in the court on their behalf. This is known as "[[public interest litigation]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}} This was the case where [[public interest litigation]] was introduced (date of ruling 15 December 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; High Court and Supreme Court judges can also act on their own on the basis of media reports.

The Fundamental Rights emphasize equality by guaranteeing to all citizens the access and use of public institutions and protections, irrespective of their background. The rights to life and personal liberty apply to persons of any nationality, while others, such as the freedom of speech and expression are applicable only to the [[Indian nationality law|citizens of India]] (including [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|non-resident Indian]] citizens).&lt;ref&gt;Tayal, B.B. &amp; Jacob, A. (2005), ''Indian History, World Developments and Civics'', p. A-25&lt;/ref&gt; The right to equality in matters of public employment cannot be conferred to [[Indian nationality law#Overseas citizenship|overseas citizens of India]].&lt;ref name="OCI"&gt;{{cite web

Fundamental Rights primarily protect individuals from any arbitrary State actions, but some rights are enforceable against private individuals too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}} This was the case where Fundamental Rights were enforced against private individuals (date of ruling 15 December 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the constitution abolishes untouchability and prohibits ''[[Unfree labour|begar]]''. These provisions act as a check both on State action and actions of private individuals. Fundamental Rights are not absolute and are subject to reasonable restrictions as necessary for the protection of national interest. In the [[Basic structure#Kesavananda|''Kesavananda Bharati vs. state of Kerala'' case]], the Supreme Court ruled that all provisions of the constitution, including Fundamental Rights can be amended.&lt;ref&gt;[[Basic structure#Kesavananda|''Kesavananda Bharati vs. state of Kerala''; AIR 1973 S.C. 1461, (1973) 4 SCC 225]] – In what became famously known as the "Fundamental Rights case", the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] decided that the basic structure of the constitution was unamendable.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Parliament cannot alter the basic structure of the constitution like secularism, democracy, federalism, separation of powers. Often called the "Basic structure doctrine", this decision is widely regarded as an important part of Indian history. In the 1978 ''[[Maneka Gandhi]] v. Union of India'' case, the Supreme Court extended the doctrine's importance as superior to any parliamentary legislation. According to the verdict, no act of parliament can be considered a law if it violated the basic structure of the constitution. This landmark guarantee of Fundamental Rights was regarded as a unique example of judicial independence in preserving the sanctity of Fundamental Rights.
The Fundamental Rights can only be altered by a constitutional amendment, hence their inclusion is a check not only on the executive branch, but also on the Parliament and state legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;Tayal, B.B. &amp; Jacob, A. (2005), ''Indian History, World Developments and Civics'', p. A-24&lt;/ref&gt; The imposition of a [[State of Emergency in India|state of emergency]] may lead to a temporary suspension of the rights conferred by Article 19 (including freedoms of speech, assembly and movement, etc.) to preserve national security and public order. The [[President (government title)|President]] can, by order, suspend the constitutional written remedies as well.

===Japan===
{{Main article|Human rights in Japan}}
Since 1947, [[Japan]], a country with a [[constitutional monarchy]] and known for its socially "conservative society where change is gradual," has a [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]] with a seemingly strong bill of rights at its core ([[:wikisource: Constitution of Japan#CHAPTER III. RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE PEOPLE|Chapter III. Rights and Duties of the People]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VvL8d8RH-Z8C&amp;q=Japan+conservative+society+where+change+is+gradual&amp;pg=PT225 | title=Japan: A Global Studies Handbook | publisher=ABC-CLIO | author=Ellington, Lucien | year=2002 | location=Santa Barbara, CA | page=209 | isbn=978-1576072714}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, it resembles the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] prior to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], and that is because it came into life during the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[occupation of Japan]].  This constitution may have felt like a foreign imposition to the governing elites, but not to the ordinary people "who lacked faith in their discredited leaders and supported meaningful change."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Law|first=David S.|date=2013-05-26|title=The Myth of the Imposed Constitution|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2270399|language=en|location=Rochester, NY|ssrn=2270399}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the abstract, the constitution strives to secure fundamental individual liberties and rights, which are covered pointedly in articles 10 to 40.  Most salient of the human dignity articles is article 25, section 1, which guarantees that all [[:wikisource: Constitution of Japan#CHAPTER III. RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE PEOPLE|"people shall have the right to maintain the minimum standards of wholesome and cultured living."]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.corteidh.or.cr/tablas/27531.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.corteidh.or.cr/tablas/27531.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live | title=Japan's foreign policy towards human rights: uncertain changes | author=Yokota, Yozo, &amp; Chiyuki Aoi | journal=Human Rights and Comparative Foreign Policy: Foundations of Peace, Edited by David Forsythe | year=2000 | volume=United Nations University Press | pages=Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the adoption of this liberal constitution, often referred as the "Postwar Constitution" (戦後憲法, Sengo-Kenpō) or the "Peace Constitution" (平和憲法, Heiwa-Kenpō), the Japanese governing elites have struggled to usher in an inclusive, open and [[Pluralist society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H-HODTsc7LsC | title=Building Democracy in Japan | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Haddad, Mary Alice | year=2012 | location=Cambridge| page=59 | isbn=978-1107014077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the end of [[World War II]] and the departure of the [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers#End of SCAP|Allied government of occupation]] in 1952, Japan has been the target of international criticism for failing to admit to [[war crimes]], [[Freedom of religion|institutional religious discrimination]] and maintaining a weak [[freedom of the press]], the treatment of children, minorities, foreigners, and women, its punitive criminal justice system, and more recently, the systematic bias against [[LGBT]] people.&lt;ref name="Japan veering away"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/02/25/national/japan-veering-away-from-global-human-rights-standards-says-amnesty-international/ | title=Japan veering away from global human rights standards, says Amnesty International | work=[[The Japan Times]] | date=February 25, 2015 | access-date=July 5, 2016 | agency=[[Kyodo News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Japan LGBT Discrimination"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.outrightinternational.org/content/un-urges-end-discrimination-against-lgbt-individuals-japan | title=UN Urges End to Discrimination Against LGBT Individuals in Japan | publisher=Outright International | work=Analysis | date=July 25, 2014 | access-date=July 5, 2016 |author1=Suzanne Trimel }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/06/26/national/u-s-rights-report-slams-japan-on-child-abuse-prison-conditions-asylum-system/#.V3sEBJMrJE6 | title=U.S. rights report slams Japan on child abuse, prison conditions, asylum system | work=News report | date=June 26, 2015 | agency=Japan Times | access-date=July 5, 2016 | author=Osumi, Magdalena}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Japanese attempt to a bill of rights was in the 19th century [[Meiji constitution]] (1890), which took both the [[Constitution of Prussia (1850)|Prussian]] (1850) and [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British]] constitutions as basic models.&lt;ref&gt;Kazuhiro Takii and David Noble, The Meiji Constitution: The Japanese Experience of the West and the Shaping of the Modern State (Tokyo, Japan: International House of Japan, 2007), 181.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it had but a meager influence in the practice of the rule of law as well as in people's daily living.  So, the short and deliberately gradual history of struggles for personal rights and protection against government/society's impositions has yet to transform Japan into a champion of universal and individual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Gordon, ''Postwar Japan As History''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Henderson |first= Dan Fenno |editor-last= Ward |editor-first= Robert E. |title= Political Development in Modern Japan: Studies in the Modernization of Japan |publisher= Princeton University Press |date=2015 |pages=441–445|chapter=Chapter 11: Law and Political Modernization in Japan |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vqJ9BgAAQBAJ&amp;q=bill+of+rights&amp;pg=PA445 |access-date=July 5, 2016|isbn= 978-1400871667}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ugo Dessì, ''Japanese Religions and Globalization''. London: Routledge, 2013, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; According to constitutional scholar, [[Shigenori Matsui]],

{{Quote|text= People tend to view the bill of rights as a moral imperative and not as a judicial norm. The people also tend to rely upon bureaucrats to remedy social problems, including even human rights violations, rather than the court.|author= Shigenori Matsui | source="The protection of 'Fundamental human rights' in Japan."&lt;ref&gt;“The protection of ‘Fundamental human rights’ in Japan,” a chapter in Human Rights in Asia: A Comparative Legal Study of Twelve Asian Jurisdictions, France and the USA, edited by Peerenboom, R. P., Carole Petersen, and Hongyi Chen (London: Routledge, 2006), 149&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite the divergences between Japan's social culture and the [[Constitutional liberalism|Liberal Constitutionalism]] that it purports to have adopted, the country has moved toward closing the gap between the notion and the practice of the law. The trend is more evident in the long term. Among several examples, the [[National Diet|Diet]] (bicameral legislature) ratified the [[International Bill of Human Rights]] in 1979 and then it passed the Law for Equal Opportunity in Employment for Men and Women in 1985, measures that were heralded as major steps toward a democratic and participatory society.  In 2015, moreover, it reached an agreement with [[Korea]] to compensate for abuses related to the so-called "[[Comfort women|women of comfort]]" that took place during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]] of the [[Korean Peninsula|peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35188135 | title=Japan and South Korea agree WW2 'comfort women' deal | date=December 28, 2015 | agency=BBC | access-date=July 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, human rights group, and families of the survivors condemned the agreement as patronizing and insulting.&lt;ref name=" horrific story of Korea's 'comfort women' "&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/the-horrific-story-of-koreas-comfort-women---forced-to-be-sex-sl/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/the-horrific-story-of-koreas-comfort-women---forced-to-be-sex-sl/ |archive-date=2022-01-12 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live | title=The horrific story of Korea's 'comfort women' – forced to be sex slaves during World War Two | work=Telegraph | date=December 29, 2015 | access-date=July 5, 2016 | author=Sanghani, Radhika | location=London}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On its official [https://web.archive.org/web/20180423032635/http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/HB/hb-03.html site], the Japanese government has identified various human rights problems. Among these are child abuses (e.g., [[bullying]], [[corporal punishment]], [[child sexual abuse]], [[child prostitution]], and [[child pornography]]), frequent neglect and ill-treatment of [[Elder abuse|elderly persons]] and individuals with [[Disability abuse|disabilities]], [[Burakumin#Discrimination in access to services|Dowa claims]] (discrimination against the [[Burakumin]]), [[Ainu people]] (indigenous people in Japan), foreign nationals, [[HIV/AIDS in Japan|HIV/AIDS carriers]], [[Hansen's disease]] patients, persons released from prison after serving their sentence, [[Victims' rights|crime victims]], people whose [[Human rights#Information and communication technologies|human rights are violated using the Internet]], the homeless, individuals with [[Gender dysphoria|gender identity disorders]], and [[Misogyny|women]]. Also, the government lists systematic problems with gender biases and the standard reference to sexual preferences for jobs and other functions in society.&lt;ref name="Major problems"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/HB/hb-03.html | title=Major Human Rights Problems | publisher=Ministry of Justice, Japan | work=Human Rights Bureau | date=March 6, 2009 | access-date=July 5, 2016 | author=Government of Japan | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423032635/http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/HB/hb-03.html | archive-date=April 23, 2018 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights organizations, national and foreign, expand the list to include human rights violations that relate to government policies, as in the case of [[daiyo kangoku]] system (substitute prison) and the methods of interrogating crime suspects.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Flynn,  Reframing the Intercultural Dialogue on Human Rights: A Philosophical Approach (London: Routledge, 2014), 114.&lt;/ref&gt; The effort of these agencies and ordinary people seem to pay off. In 2016, the U.S. Department of State released a report stating that Japan's human right record is showing signs of improvement.&lt;ref name=" human rights improve but problems persist"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/04/14/national/social-issues/japan-human-rights-improve-problems-persist-u-s-state-department/#.V3tLxZMrKRs | title=Japan human rights improve but problems persist: U.S. State Department | work=Japan Times  | date=April 14, 2016 | access-date=July 5, 2016 | author=Wanklyn, Alastair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
Whilst Australia does not have an enshrined Bill of Rights or similar binding legal document, civil liberties are assumed as protected through a series of rules and conventions. Australia had primary involvement in and was a key signatory to the UN Universal Declaration on Human Rights (1948)

The [[Constitution of Australia]] (1900) does offer very limited protection of rights:
* the right to freedom of religion and;
* the right to freedom from discrimination based on out-of-state residence (historical prejudice based upon residence within one state affecting treatment within another)
Certain High Court interpretations of the Constitution have allowed for implied rights such as freedom of political communication (which is construed broadly) and the right to vote to be established, however others such as freedom of assembly and freedom of association are yet to be identified.

'''Refugee issues'''

Within the past decade Australia has experienced increasing contention regarding its treatment of those seeking asylum. Although Australia is a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention (1951), successive governments have demonstrated an increasing tightening of borders; particularly against those who seek passage via small water vessels.

The Abbott Government (2013) like its predecessors (the Gillard and Howard Governments) has encountered particular difficulty curbing asylum seekers via sea, increasingly identified as "illegal immigration". The recent involvement of the Australian Navy in refugee rescue operations has many human rights groups such as Amnesty International concerned over the "militarisation" of treatment to the refugee and the issue of their [[human rights in Australia]]. The current "turn-back" policy is particularly divisive, as it involves placing refugees in government lifeboats and turning them towards Indonesia. Despite opposition however, the Abbott government's response has so far seen a reduction in the number of potential refugees undertaking the hazardous cross to Australia, which is argued by the government as an indicator for its policy success.

==Europe==

===European Convention on Human Rights===
The [[European Convention on Human Rights]], to which almost all European countries belong (apart from [[Belarus]]), enumerates a number of civil liberties and is of varying constitutional force in different European states.

===Czech Republic===
Following the [[Velvet Revolution]], a constitutional overhaul took place in [[Czech and Slovak Federal Republic|Czechoslovakia]]. In 1991, the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms]] was adopted, having the same legal standing as the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|Constitution]]. The Czech Republic has kept the Charter in its entirety following the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]] as Act No. 2/1993 Coll. (Constitution being No. 1).

===France===
France's 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] listed many civil liberties and is of constitutional force.

===Germany===
The [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]], the "Grundgesetz" (lit. "Base Law"), starts with an elaborate listing of civil liberties and states in sec. 1 "The dignity of man is inviolable. To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all public authority." Following the "[[Austrian System]]", the people have the right to appeal to the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] ("Bundesverfassungsgericht") if they feel their civil rights are being violated. This procedure has shaped German law considerably over the years.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|Civil liberties in the United Kingdom}}
Civil liberties in the [[United Kingdom]] date back to [[Magna Carta]] in 1215 and 17th century [[English common law|common law]] and [[statute law]], such as the 1628 [[Petition of Right]], the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679]] and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]]. Parts of these laws remain in statute today and are supplemented by other legislation and conventions that collectively form the uncodified [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]]. In addition, the United Kingdom is a signatory to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] which covers both [[human rights]] and civil liberties. The [[Human Rights Act 1998]] incorporates the great majority of Convention rights directly into UK law.

In June 2008 the then Shadow Home Secretary [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] [[David Davis by-election campaign, 2008|resigned his parliamentary seat]] over what he described as the "erosion of civil liberties" by the then Labour government, and was re-elected on a civil liberties platform (although he was not opposed by candidates of other major parties). This was in reference to anti-terrorism laws and in particular the extension to pre-trial detention, that is perceived by many to be an infringement of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' established in Magna Carta.

===Russia===
The [[Constitution of Russia|Constitution of the Russian Federation]] guarantees in theory many of the same rights and civil liberties as the U.S. except to [[bear arms]], i.e.: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of association and assembly, freedom to choose language, to due process, to a fair trial, privacy, freedom to vote, right for education, etc. However, human rights groups like [[Amnesty International]] have warned that [[Vladimir Putin]] has seriously curtailed [[freedom of expression]], [[freedom of assembly]] and [[freedom of association]] amidst growing [[authoritarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/27/russia.humanrights|title=Putin rolling back civil rights, warns Amnesty|date=February 27, 2008|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America==

===Canada===
The [[Constitution of Canada]] includes the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] which guarantees many of the same rights as the U.S. constitution. The Charter omits any mention of, or protection for, property.

===United States===
{{main article|Civil liberties in the United States}}
The [[United States Constitution]], especially its [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], protects civil liberties. The passage of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] further protected civil liberties by introducing the [[Privileges or Immunities Clause]], [[Due Process Clause]], and [[Equal Protection Clause]]. Human rights within the United States are often called [[civil rights]], which are those rights, privileges and immunities held by all people, in distinction to ''political'' rights, which are the rights that inhere to those who are entitled to participate in elections, as candidates or voters.&lt;ref&gt;America's Constitution: A Biography by Akhil Reed Amar&lt;/ref&gt; Before universal suffrage, this distinction was important, since many people were ineligible to vote but still were considered to have the fundamental freedoms derived from the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. This distinction is less important now that Americans enjoy near [[universal suffrage]], and civil rights are now taken to include the political rights to vote and participate in elections, being furthermore classified with civil liberties in general as either [[Negative and positive rights|positive rights or negative rights]]. Because Native American tribal governments retain sovereignty over tribal members, the U.S. Congress in 1968 enacted a law that essentially applies most of the protections of the Bill of Rights to tribal members, to be enforced mainly by [[tribal court]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J.

The [[Civil Liberties Act of 1988]] was signed into effect by President [[Ronald Reagan]] on August 10, 1988. The act was passed by Congress to issue a public apology for those of Japanese ancestry who [[Internment of Japanese Americans#Hardship and material loss|lost their property and liberty]] due to discriminatory actions by the United States Government during [[Internment of Japanese Americans|the internment period]]. This act also provided many other benefits within various sectors of the government. Within the treasury it established a civil liberties public education fund. It directed the Attorney General to identify and locate each individual affected by this act and to pay them $20,000 from the civil liberties public education fund. It also established a board of directors who is responsible for making disbursements from this fund. Finally, it required that all documents and records that are created or received by the commission be kept by the [[Archivist of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foley|first1=Thomas|title=Civil Liberties Act of 1987 – Conference Report|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/100th-congress/house-bill/442|website=Congress.gov|access-date=2015-06-18|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;
