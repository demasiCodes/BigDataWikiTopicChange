Examples include the [[right to life]], the right to [[privacy]], the [[right to a fair trial]], [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of assembly]]. These are usually guaranteed and protected by a [[constitution]] or by adherence to an international [[treaty]]. In many places there are disputes over certain liberties, regarding the question of whether they can be considered civil liberties at all, and, if so, whether they should be protected. Examples include [[reproductive rights]], the right of [[gay marriage]], and the right of [[narcotic possession]].


Most western [[democracy|democracies]] (as well as many other countries) have [[constitution]]s and [[public policy (law)|public policies]] that protect civil liberties. The following sections of this article present a few examples.

==European countries==
The [[European Convention on Human Rights]], to which most European countries, including all of the [[European Union]], belong, lists forth a number of civil liberties.

[[France]]'s [[1789]] [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], listing many civil liberties, is of constitutional force.

==Canada==
The [[Constitution of Canada]] includes the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] which guarantees many of the same rights as the US constitution, with the notable exception of protection against [[establishment of religion]]. However, the Charter does protect [[freedom of religion]].

==China==
''Main article: '''[[Civil liberties in the People's Republic of China]]'''''

The [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|People's Republic of China Constitution]], especially its Fundamental Rights and Duties of Citizens, protects many civil liberties.

==United Kingdom==
While the [[United Kingdom]] has no codified constitution, (it is only partially written) it is a signatory to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) which covers both [[human rights]] and civil liberties, and the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]], which incorporates the great majority of Convention rights directly into UK law. Derry Irvine (then the Lord Chancellor) was praised widely for his legal skill in overseeing the drafting of the bill.

After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] the UK passed the [[Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001]], Part 4 of which provided for the indefinite [[internment|detention without trial]] of foreign nationals whom the Home Secretary suspected of involvement in [[terrorism]]. In order to pass this legislation, the UK [[derogated]] from Article 5 of the Convention on the grounds that the terrorist threat to the UK constituted a 'public emergency threatening the life of the nation' within the terms of Article 15. In December 2004, the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords ruled by a majority of 8-1 that Part 4 of the 2001 Act was incompatible with Articles 5 and 14 of the Convention. Although a majority of the [[Law Lords]] agreed that the terrorist threat to the UK constituted a public emergency within the meaning of Article 15, it found that the use of indefinite detention was both disproportionate (in that less restrictive measures were available) and discriminatory (since UK nationals suspected of terrorism were not liable to indefinite detention). This prompted the government to pass the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]], which provides for the use of [['control orders']] against both UK and foreign nationals suspected of involvement in terrorism. The courts have yet to rule on the compatibility of these orders, although human rights groups have argued they are incompatible with both Article 5 (the right to liberty) and Article 6 (the right to a fair trial).

Despite the UK's liberal heritage, the Government's [[Office of the Information Commissioner|Information Commissioner]] stated in [[2004]] that the country is currently in danger of becoming a [[Mass surveillance|surveillance society]]. See also [[British national identity card]].

==United States==
''Main article: '''[[Civil liberties in the United States]]'''''

The [[United States Constitution]], especially its [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], protects many civil liberties.

==Estonia==
''Main article: '''[[Civil liberties in Estonia]]'''''

The [[Estonia Constitution]] protects many civil liberties.
