Examples include [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of assembly]], and [[trial by jury]]. These are usually created and protected by a [[constitution]].

''Contrast:'' [[human rights]], [[civil rights]].

== United States ==

The [[United States Constitution]], especially its [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], protects many civil liberties.

==Canada==

The [[Constitution of Canada]] includes the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] which guarantees many of the same rights as the US constitution, with the notable exception of protection against [[establishment of religion]]. (Such protection is not practical, since the [[Anglican Church]] of Canada is nominally the [[state religion]].) But the Charter does protect [[freedom of religion]].

== United Kingdom ==

The [[United Kingdom|UK]] has no formal written constitution, however it is a signatory to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) which covers both [[human rights]] and civil liberties, and has passed the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]], which forces compliance between the treaty and UK law. After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] the UK claimed a state of emergency (as permitted by Article 15 of the ECHR) and the [[derogate|derogation]] from Article Five in order to allow the indefinite [[detention without trial]] of foreign nationals suspected of involvement with [[terrorism]]. The government would rather deport these individuals, but this is prohibited by Article Three of the ECHR, which can not be opted out from according to Article 15.
