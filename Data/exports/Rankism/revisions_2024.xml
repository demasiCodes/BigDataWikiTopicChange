'''Rankism''' is "abusive, discriminatory, and/or exploitative behavior towards people because of their [[Social class|rank]] in a particular [[hierarchy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
Rank-based abuse underlies many other phenomena such as [[bullying]], [[racism]], [[supremacism]] (often [[white supremacy]]), [[xenophobia]], [[hazing]], [[ageism]], [[sexism]], [[ableism]], [[mentalism (discrimination)|mentalism]], [[antisemitism]], [[homophobia]] and [[transphobia]]. The term "rankism" was popularized by physicist, educator, and [[Citizen diplomacy|citizen diplomat]] [[Robert W. Fuller]].

== Characteristics ==

Rankism can take many forms, including
* exploiting one's position within a hierarchy to secure unwarranted advantages and benefits (e.g. massive corporate bonuses);
* abusing a position of power (e.g., abusive [[parental abuse of children|parent]] or [[Religious abuse|priest]], [[Corporate corruption|corrupt CEO]], [[Workplace bullying|bully boss]], [[prisoner abuse]]);
* using rank as a shield to get away with [[insulting]] or [[humiliating]] others with impunity;
* using rank to maintain a position of power long after it can be justified;
* exporting the rank achieved in one sphere of activity to claim superior value as a person;
* exploiting rank that is illegitimately acquired or held (as in situations resting on specious distinctions of social rank, such as [[racism]], [[sexism]], [[intellectualism]], [[wealth]], [[Religious persecution|religious beliefs]], [[hereditary]], [[marital status]], [[gang|gang affiliation]], [[criminal record]], [[egotism]] or [[classism]]).

Rankism can occur in any [[social hierarchy]], such as governments, corporations, families, non-profit organizations, and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of term ==

The term rankism first appeared in print in the ''Oberlin Alumni Magazine'' for fall of 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Fuller
 | first = Robert
 | date = Fall 1997
 | title = Campus Activities (sidebar)
 | journal = Oberlin Alumni Magazine
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later appeared in a book called ''Somebodies and Nobodies: Overcoming the Abuse of Rank,'' written by Fuller and published in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Fuller
 | first = Robert W.
 | year = 2003
 | title = Somebodies and Nobodies: Overcoming the Abuse of Rank
 | url = https://archive.org/details/somebodiesnobodi00full
 | url-access = registration
 | publisher = New Society Publishers
 | location = Gabriola Island, Canada
 | isbn = 0-86571-486-X
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first use of the term in a management journal occurred in 2001 in a ''[[Leader to Leader Institute]]'' article. The piece questioned the abuse of rank in work hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Fuller
 | first = Robert W
 |date=Summer 2001
 | title = A New Look at Hierarchy: How do we make sure that rank is exercised appropriately?
 | journal = Leader to Leader
 | volume = 21
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of rankism has since been widely covered in the media, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[NPR]]'', ''[[C-SPAN]]'', ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', the ''[[BBC]]'', ''[[Voice of America]]'', and ''[[O, The Oprah Magazine]]''.

Other notable references of rankism include Fuller's second book on the subject, ''All Rise: Somebodies, Nobodies, and the Politics of Dignity,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Fuller
 | first = Robert W.
 | year = 2006

 | publisher = Berrett-Koehler Publishers
 | isbn = 978-1-57675-385-9
 | url = https://archive.org/details/allrisesomebodie00full
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; and an action-oriented guide titled ''Dignity for All: How to Create a World Without Rankism.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

The Human Dignity and Humiliation Studies (Human DHS) network has also accepted the concept of rankism as core to its mission. It asserts, "...the mission we have undertaken at Human DHS is the confrontation of abuse, rankism and the humiliation endemic to it, on the historical scale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional mediator Julia Ann Wambach uses Fuller's definition of rankism to explore the abuse of position within a hierarchy from both up and down the lines of power, including how rankism feeds on itself in group contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Wambach, Julie Ann (2008). ''Battles between Somebodies and Nobodies: Combat Abuse of Rank at Work and At Home''. Brookside Press. {{ISBN|978-0-9814818-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rankism and dignity ==

According to Fuller, the abuse of rank is experienced by victims as an affront to their [[dignity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller and his supporters have launched a new [[social movement]] to promote the creation of a dignitarian society. The Dignity Movement's goal is to overcome rankism in the same way that the [[civil rights movement]] and [[feminist movement|women's movements]] target racism and sexism.
