The word '''rankism''' was coined by [[Robert W. Fuller]] in his book [[Somebodies and Nobodies: Overcoming the Abuse of Rank]] published in [[2003]].

Examples of rankism would be a guest humiliating a waitress or a boss picking on an employee to the sole satisfaction or securing of the own position of the former. So it is then an abuse of power. On a bit different view it could also be called [[mobbing]] in some situations.

Abolishment of rankism would be to grant everone the same unalterable dignity in one owns eyes and behave after it. Some other -isms can be seen as subgroups as they also act about abuse of power of potent groups like [[racism]] or [[sexism]].</rev></revisions></page></pages></query></api>
