'''Rankism''' is a term coined by physicist, educator, and [[Citizen diplomacy|citizen diplomat]] [[Robert W. Fuller]]. Fuller has defined rankism as: "abusive, discriminatory, or exploitative behavior towards people because of their rank in a particular hierarchy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;. Fuller claims that rankism also describes the abuse of the power inherent in superior rank, with the view that rank-based abuse underlies many other phenomena such as [[bullying]], [[racism]], [[sexism]], and [[homophobia]]. 

==Characteristics==
Fuller asserts that rankism involves:
* exploiting one's position within a hierarchy to secure unwarranted advantages and benefits, without regard to the deprivation of people deemed to be inferior;
* illegitimate use of rank (e.g., abusive parent or [[Religious abuse|priest]], [[Corporate corruption|corrupt CEO]], [[Workplace bullying|bully boss]], [[prisoner abuse]], etc.);
* treating rank as a shield that permits one person to [[insult]] or [[humiliate]] others with impunity;
* using rank to perpetuate position long after it can be justified while quashing talented people who might challenge that position;
* exporting rank achieved in one sphere of activity to claim superior importance as a person;
* use of rank illegitimately acquired or held (as in situations resting on specious distinctions of social rank such as [[racism]], [[sexism]], etc.).

Fuller has also theorized that:
* victims of rankists may find themselves publicly humiliated or [[Silent treatment|ignored]] and treated as invisible;
* rankism can occur in any [[social hierarchy]], such as governments, corporations, families, non-profit organizations, and universities;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;. 
* the opponents of rankism believe that position and power should be used to serve the group over which one holds authority.

== Use of term ==
The term rankism first appeared in print in the Oberlin Alumni Magazine for fall of 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Fuller
 | first = Robert
 | year = Fall 1997
 | title = Campus Activities (sidebar)
 | journal = Oberlin Alumni Magazine
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller later wrote a book on the topic called ''Somebodies and Nobodies: Overcoming the Abuse of Rank'' which he began distributing on his web site as a free e-book in 2000 and published in print form in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Fuller
 | first = Robert W.
 | year = 2003
 | title = Somebodies and Nobodies: Overcoming the Abuse of Rank
 | publisher = New Society Publishers
 | location = Gabriola Island, Canada
 | isbn = 0-86571-486-X
}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Somebodies and Nobodies'' has since been translated into Korean. Also in 2000, Fuller used the term in a series of op-ed pieces for the California newspaper [[The Berkeley Daily Planet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | last = Fuller
 | first = Robert
 | year = 2000
 | title = Front Page News: Rank-based discrimination is just as alive as other ‘isms’ 
 | url = http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2000-10-09/article/1573?headline=Rank-based-discrimination-is-just-as-alive-as-other-isms-
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first use of the term in a management journal occurred in 2001, when Fuller wrote an article for the [http://www.leadertoleader.org/ Leader to Leader Institute] (formerly the Peter F. Drucker Foundation for Nonprofit Management) about the abuse of rank in hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Fuller
 | first = Robert W
 | month = Summer
 | year = 2001
 | title = A New Look at Hierarchy: How do we make sure that rank is exercised appropriately?
 | journal = Leader to Leader
 | volume = 21
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea has since been widely covered in the media, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[NPR]]'', ''[[C-SPAN]]'', ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', the ''[[BBC]]'', ''[[Voice of America]]'', and ''[[O, The Oprah Magazine]]''.

Fuller's second book on the subject, ''All Rise: Somebodies, Nobodies, and the Politics of Dignity'', was published in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Fuller
 | first = Robert W.
 | year = 2006
 | title = All Rise: Somebodies, Nobodies, and the Politics of Dignity
 | publisher = Berrett-Koehler Publishers
 | isbn = 978-1576753859 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; ''All Rise'' has been translated into [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Bangla]], and has been published independently in India by the [[Viveka Foundation]]. In 2008, Fuller and co-author Pamela A. Gerloff released an eighty-six page "action-oriented guide" titled ''Dignity for All: How to Create a World Without Rankism''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Fuller
 | first = Robert W.
 | coauthors = Pamela A. Gerloff
 | year = 2008

 | page = back cover 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; on the issue of rankism and the steps individuals can take to address it. ''Dignity for All'' has been translated into Bangla.

The term has also been extended to incorporate the idea of [[bullying]], such as in this quote from Canadian Living: 
"Basically, '''rankism is bullying someone of a lower rank.'''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |last = Fisher
 | first = Diana
 | title = Rankism: Bullying someone of a lower rank at work
 | url = http://www.canadianliving.com/life/work/rankism_bullying_someone_of_a_lower_rank_at_work.php
 | accessdate = 2008-09-24
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Human Dignity and Humiliation Studies (HumanDHS) network, of which Robert Fuller is a member, has also accepted the concept of rankism as core to their mission. They assert:  "...the mission we have undertaken at Human DHS is the confrontation of abuse, rankism and the humiliation endemic to it, on the historical scale." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional mediator Julia Ann Wambach uses Fuller's definition of rankism to explore the abuse of position within a hierarchy from both up and down the lines of power, including how rankism feeds on itself in group contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Wambach, Julie Ann (2008). ''Battles between Somebodies and Nobodies: Combat Abuse of Rank at Work and At Home''. Brookside Press. ISBN 978-0-9814818-0-7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rankism and dignity ==
According to Fuller, the abuse of rank is experienced by victims as an affront to their [[dignity]]. He defines the term dignitarian as "a condition in which the dignity of all people is honored and protected." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | first = Robert
  | title = Dignity: A Universal Right
  | url=http://www.breakingranks.net/weblog/dignity
  | accessdate = 2008-09-16
  }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller and his supporters have launched a new [[social movement]] to promote the creation of a dignitarian society.  The Dignitarian Movement asserts that their aim is to overcome rankism in the same way that the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights]] and [[feminist movement|women's movements]] target racism and sexism.
