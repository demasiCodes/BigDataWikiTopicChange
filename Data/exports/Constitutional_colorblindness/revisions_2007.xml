Ferguson]] ''in 1896.  Prior to this (and for a good while afterwards), the Supreme Court considered color as a determining factor in many landmark cases.  Constitutional colorblindness holds that skin color or race is virtually never a legitimate ground for legal or political distinctions, and thus, any law that is "color conscious" (regardless of whether it's intent is to subordinate a group, or remedy discrimination) is presumptively unconstitutional. The concept, therefore, has been brought to bear both against vestiges of Jim Crow oppression, as well as remedial efforts aimed out overcoming such discrimination (such as [[affirmative action]]).
