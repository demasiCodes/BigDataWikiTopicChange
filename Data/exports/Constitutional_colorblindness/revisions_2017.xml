'''Constitutional colorblindness''' is an aspect of [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case evaluation that began with [[John Marshall Harlan|Justice Harlan]]'s dissent in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]] ''in 1896.  Prior to this (and for a good while afterwards), the Supreme Court considered color as a determining factor in many landmark cases.  Constitutional colorblindness holds that skin color or race is virtually never a legitimate ground for legal or political distinctions, and thus, any law that is "color conscious" is presumptively unconstitutional regardless of whether its intent is to subordinate a group, or remedy discrimination. The concept, therefore, has been brought to bear both against vestiges of [[Jim Crow]] oppression, as well as remedial efforts aimed at overcoming such discrimination, such as [[affirmative action]].
