'''Heteronormativity''' is the concept that [[heterosexuality]] is the preferred or [[Norm (social)|normal]] [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors =Harris J, White V|title =A Dictionary of Social Work and Social Care|isbn = 978-0-19-251686-2 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2018|access-date=19 August 2018|page=335|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M3FGDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT335}}&lt;/ref&gt; It assumes the [[gender binary]] (i.e., that there are only two distinct, opposite [[gender]]s) and that sexual and marital relations are most fitting between people of opposite sex.

Heteronormativity creates and upholds a social hierarchy based on sexual orientation with the practice and belief that heterosexuality is deemed as the societal norm.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, T.

==Etymology==
[[Michael Warner]] popularized the term in 1991,&lt;ref name="warner1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Warner |first1=Michael |title=Introduction: Fear of a Queer Planet |journal=Social Text |date=1991 |issue=29 |pages=3–17 |jstor=466295 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in one of the first major works of [[queer theory]]. The concept's roots are in [[Gayle Rubin]]'s notion of the "sex/gender system" and [[Adrienne Rich]]'s notion of [[Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence|compulsory heterosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rich |first1=Adrienne |authorlink=Adrienne Rich|title=Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence |journal=Signs |date=July 1980 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=631–660 |doi=10.1086/493756 |s2cid=143604951 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the outset, theories of heteronormativity included a critical look at gender; Warner wrote that "every person who comes to a queer self-understanding knows in one way or another that her stigmatization is intricated with gender. ... Being queer ... means being able, more or less articulately, to challenge the common understanding of what [[gender difference]] means."&lt;ref name="warner1991"/&gt; [[Lauren Berlant]] and Warner further developed these ideas in their seminal essay, "Sex in Public".&lt;ref name="Berlant98"&gt;{{cite journal |author-link1=Lauren Berlant |last1=Berlant |first1=Lauren |last2=Warner |first2=Michael |title=Sex in Public |journal=Critical Inquiry |date=1 January 1998 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=547–566 |doi=10.1086/448884 |s2cid=161701244 |url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/448884 |issn=0093-1896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to marriage and the nuclear family==
Modern family structures in the past and present vary from what was typical of the 1950s [[nuclear family]]. In the United States, the families of the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century were characterized by the death of one or both parents for many American children.&lt;ref name="Coontz"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coontz |first1=Stephanie |title=The way we never were: American families and the nostalgia trap |date=1992 |publisher=Basic books |location=New York |isbn=0465001351}}{{page needed|date=May 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, the United States is estimated to have been home to approximately 2.5 million post-divorce, [[stepfamily]] households containing children.&lt;ref name=CGG&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coleman |first1=Marilyn |last2=Ganong |first2=Lawrence H. |last3=Goodwin |first3=Chanel |title=The Presentation of Stepfamilies in Marriage and Family Textbooks: A Reexamination |journal=Family Relations |date=July 1994 |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=289 |doi=10.2307/585420 |jstor=585420 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1980s, almost 20% of families with children headed by a married couple were stepfamilies.&lt;ref name=CGG/&gt;

Over the past three decades, rates of divorce, single parenting, and [[cohabitation]] have risen precipitously.&lt;ref name="Benfer"&gt;Benfer, Amy. [http://archive.salon.com/mwt/feature/2001/06/07/family_values/index.html The Nuclear Family Takes a Hit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522052539/http://archive.salon.com/mwt/feature/2001/06/07/family_values/index.html |date=22 May 2008 }}, Salon.com.  7 June 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Nontraditional families (which diverge from "a middle-class family with a bread-winning father and a stay-at-home mother, married to each other and raising their biological children") constitute the majority of families in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] today.&lt;ref name="Benfer"/&gt; [[Shared Earning/Shared Parenting Marriage]] (also known as Peer Marriage) where two heterosexual parents are both providers of resources and nurturers to children has become popular. Modern families may also have single-parent headed families which can be caused by divorce, separation, death, families who have two parents who are not married but have children, or families with same-sex parents. With [[artificial insemination]], [[surrogate mother]]s, and [[adoption]], families do not have to be formed by the heteronormative biological union of a male and a female. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Widening Concept of Parent in Canada: Step- Parents, Same-Sex Partners, &amp; Parents by ART |journal=American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law |year=2012 |last1=Bala |first1=Nicholas |last2=Ashbourne |first2=Christine |volume=30 |issue=3 |url=https://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1577&amp;context=jgspl&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;referer= |accessdate=4 July 2021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The consequences of these changes for the adults and children involved are heavily debated. In a 2009 [[Massachusetts]] spousal benefits case, developmental psychologist [[Michael Lamb (psychologist)|Michael Lamb]] testified that parental sexual orientation does not negatively affect childhood development. "Since the end of the 1980s... it has been well established that children and adolescents can adjust just as well in nontraditional settings as in traditional settings," he argued.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lamb, Ph.D.: [https://www.webcitation.org/5n2qV1QIk?url=http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/2009-11-17-doma-aff-lamb.pdf Affidavit – United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, columnist [[Maggie Gallagher]] argues that heteronormative social structures are beneficial to society because they are optimal for the raising of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.marriagedebate.com/pdf/SenateSept42003.pdf |title=Why Marriage Matters: The Case for Normal Marriage.

Heteronormative temporality, a subset of heteronormativity, posits that the ideal societal trajectory involves achieving heterosexual marriage as life's ultimate goal. This ideology imposes societal expectations that encourage individuals to conform to traditional roles within a nuclear family structure: seeking an opposite-sex partner, entering into heterosexual marriage, and raising children. Heteronormative temporality promotes [[abstinence]]-only until marriage. Many American parents adhere to this heteronormative narrative and teach it to their children. According to Amy T. Schalet, it seems that the bulk of parent-child sex education revolves around [[Abstinence-only sex education|abstinence-only]] practices in the United States, but this differs in other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Schalet, Amy T. Not under My Roof: Parents, Teens, and the Culture of Sex. Chicago: U of Chicago, 2011. {{ISBN|978-0-226-73618-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, George Washington University Professor, Abby Wilkerson, discusses how the healthcare and medicinal industries reinforce the views of heterosexual marriage to promote heteronormative temporality. The concept of heteronormative temporality extends beyond heterosexual marriage to include a pervasive system where heterosexuality is seen as a standard, and anything outside of that realm is not tolerated. Wilkerson explains that it dictates aspects of everyday life such as nutritional health, socio-economic status, personal beliefs, and traditional gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilkerson |first1=Abby |title=I Want to Hold Your Hand: Abstinence Curricula, Bioethics, and the Silencing of Desire |journal=Journal of Medical Humanities |date=June 2013 |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=101–108 |doi=10.1007/s10912-013-9213-0 |pmid=23468394 |s2cid=35152974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transgressions==
===Intersex people===
{{main|Intersex human rights|Intersex medical interventions}}
[[intersexuality|Intersex]] people have biological characteristics that are ambiguously either male or female. If such a condition is detected, intersex people in most present-day societies are almost always assigned a normative sex shortly after birth.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling, Anne. 2000. Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality. New York: Basic Books.{{pn|date=February 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surgery (usually involving modification to the genitalia) is often performed in an attempt to produce an unambiguously male or female body, with the parents'—rather than the individual's—consent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Judith Butler|Butler, Judith]]. 2004. ''[[Undoing Gender]]''. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The child is then usually raised and enculturated as a [[cisgender]] [[heterosexual]] member of the [[sex assignment|assigned sex]], which may or may not match their emergent [[gender identity]] throughout life or some remaining [[sex characteristics]] (for example, chromosomes, genes or internal sex organs).&lt;ref&gt;Wilchins, Riki. 2002.

===Transgender people===
Transgender people experience a mismatch between their [[gender identity]] and their [[Sex assignment|assigned sex]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stroud.gov.uk/info/gender_equality_scheme.pdf Stroud District Council "Gender Equality SCHEME AND ACTION PLAN 2007"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227114158/http://www.stroud.gov.uk/info/gender_equality_scheme.pdf |date=27 February 2008 }}, defines the state of being ''transgender'' as "Non-identification with, or non-presentation as, the sex (and assumed gender) one was assigned at birth."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glaad.org"&gt;Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. [http://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender "GLAAD Media Reference Guide – Transgender glossary of terms"], "[[GLAAD]]", USA, May 2010. Retrieved on 24 February 2011.

Some authors also believe that the trans umbrella includes ''[[transsexual]]'' people, who have [[transitioning (transgender)|transition]]ed through hormonal replacement therapy and sex reassignment surgery.&lt;ref name="glaad.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bilodeau"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bilodeau |first1=Brent |title=Beyond the Gender Binary: A Case Study of Two Transgender Students at a Midwestern Research University |journal=Journal of Gay &amp; Lesbian Issues in Education |date=29 December 2005 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=29–44 |doi=10.1300/J367v03n01_05 |s2cid=144070536 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Layton"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Layton |first1=Lynne |title=In Defense of Gender Ambiguity: Jessica Benjamin.

Chrisler, Donald R. McCreary, ''Handbook of Gender Research in Psychology'', volume 1 (2010, {{ISBN|1-4419-1465-X}}), page 486: "Transgender is a broad term characterized by a challenge of traditional gender roles and gender identity[. …] For example, some cultures classify transgender individuals as a third gender, thereby treating this phenomenon as normative."&lt;/ref&gt; and infrequently the term is defined very broadly to include [[cross-dresser]]s.&lt;ref name="ReisnerEtAl"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reisner |first1=Sari L. |last2=Conron |first2=Kerith |last3=Scout |first3=Nfn |last4=Mimiaga |first4=Matthew J. |last5=Haneuse |first5=Sebastien |last6=Austin |first6=S.

Some transgender people seek [[sex reassignment therapy]], and may not behave according to the gender role imposed by society. Some societies consider transgender behavior a crime worthy of capital punishment, including [[Saudi Arabia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifge.org/news/1998/sept/nws9278.htm Saudis Arrest 5 Pakistani TGs]&lt;/ref&gt; and many other nations. In some cases, gay or lesbian people were forced to undergo sex change treatments to "fix" their [[sex and gender]] in some [[Europe|European countries]] during the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2660/ The Unkindest Cut | The science and ethics of castration]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/turing_a,2.html Turing, Alan (1912–1954)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901020647/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/turing_a%2C2.html |date=1 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[South Africa]] in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McGreal |first1=Chris |title=Gays tell of mutilation by apartheid army |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jul/29/chrismcgreal |work=The Guardian |date=29 July 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries,{{which|date=January 2023}} including North American&lt;ref name="cider"/&gt; and European countries, certain forms of violence against transgender people may be tacitly endorsed when prosecutors and juries refuse to investigate, prosecute, or convict those who perform the murders and beatings.&lt;ref name="cider"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frye |first1=Phyllis |title=The International Bill of Gender Rights vs. The Cider House Rules: Transgenders Struggle with the Courts Over What Clothing They Are Allowed to Wear on the Job, Which Restroom They are Allowed to Use on the Job, Their Right to Marry, and the Very Definition of Their Sex |journal=William &amp; Mary Journal of Race, Gender, and Social Justice |date=1 October 2000 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=133 |url=https://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmjowl/vol7/iss1/6/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AmnestyUSA"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/outfront/jamaica_report.html|title=OUTfront!

In medical communities with these restrictions, patients have the option of either suppressing transsexual behavior and conforming to the norms of their birth sex (which may be necessary to avoid [[social stigma]] or even violence) or by adhering strictly to the norms of their "new" sex in order to qualify for sex reassignment surgery and hormonal treatments.

According to Penny Griffin, Politics and International Relations lecturer at the [[University of New South Wales]], homonormativity upholds [[neoliberalism]] rather than critiquing the enforcement of its values of [[monogamy]], procreation, and [[Gender binary|binary gender roles]] as inherently [[heterosexist]] and [[racist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Griffin |first1=Penny |title=Sexing the Economy in a Neo-Liberal World Order: Neo-Liberal Discourse and the (Re)Production of Heteronormative Heterosexuality |journal=The British Journal of Politics and International Relations |date=May 2007 |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=220–238 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-856x.2007.00280.x |s2cid=144295490 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, homonormativity is deeply intertwined with the expansion and  maintenance of the internationally structured and structuring capitalistic worldwide system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stryker |first1=S. |title=Transgender History, Homonormativity, and Disciplinarity |journal=Radical History Review |date=1 January 2008 |volume=2008 |issue=100 |pages=145–157 |doi=10.1215/01636545-2007-026 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Duggan asserts that homonormativity fragments LGBT communities into hierarchies of worthiness, and that LGBT people that come the closest to mimicking heteronormative standards of gender identity are deemed most worthy of receiving rights. She also states that LGBT individuals at the bottom of this hierarchy (e.g. [[Bisexual community|bisexual people]], [[Transgender|trans people]], [[Genderqueer|non-binary people]], people of [[Gender systems#Non-European gender systems|non-Western genders]], [[intersex]] people, queers of color, queer sex workers) are seen as an impediment to this class of homonormative individuals receiving their rights.&lt;ref name="Duggan, Lisa 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferguson |first=Roderick A. |chapter=Race-ing Homonormativity: Citizenship, Sociology, and Gay Identity |title=Black Queer Studies: A Critical Anthology |editor=E.

Those who do assimilate often become invisible in society and experience constant fear and shame about the non-conformers within their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Robinson |first1=Brandon Andrew |title=Is This What Equality Looks Like?: How Assimilation Marginalizes the Dutch LGBT Community |journal=Sexuality Research and Social Policy |date=December 2012 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=327–336 |doi=10.1007/s13178-012-0084-3 |s2cid=146137993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stryker referenced theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]] and his view of the public sphere allowing for individuals to come together, as a group, to discuss diverse ideologies and by excluding the non-conforming LGBTQ community, society as a whole were undoubtedly excluding the gender-variant individuals from civic participation.&lt;ref name="Stryker 2008"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics of heteronormative attitudes, such as [[Cathy J. Cohen]], [[Michael Warner]], and [[Lauren Berlant]],&lt;ref name="Berlant98" /&gt; argue that such attitudes are oppressive, stigmatizing, marginalizing of perceived deviant forms of sexuality and gender, and make self-expression more challenging when that expression does not conform to the norm.&lt;ref name=lovaas&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leap |first1=William |editor1-last=Lovaas |editor1-first=Karen E. |editor2-last=Jenkins |editor2-first=Mercilee M. |title=Sexualities and Communication in Everyday Life: A Reader |date=2007 |publisher=SAGE |location=California, USA |isbn=978-1-4129-1443-7 |pages=95–107 |language=en |chapter=Language, Socialization and Silence in Gay Adolescence".

According to cultural anthropologist [[Gayle Rubin]], heteronormativity in mainstream society creates a "sex hierarchy" that graduates sexual practices from morally "good sex" to "bad sex". The hierarchy considers reproductive, monogamous sex between committed heterosexuals as "good", whereas any sexual act or individual who falls short of this standard is labeled as "bad". Specifically, this standard categorizes long-term committed gay couples and non-monogamous/sexually active gay individuals between the two poles.&lt;ref name="thinkingsex"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rubin, Gayle|chapter=Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality|editor=Vance, Carole|title=Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick McCreery, lecturer at [[New York University]], argues that this hierarchy explains how gay people are stigmatized for socially "deviant" sexual practices that are often practiced by straight people as well, such as consumption of pornography or sex in public places.&lt;ref name="OutatWork"/&gt; There are many studies of sexual orientation discrimination on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Byron |first1=Reginald A. |last2=Lowe |first2=Maria R. |last3=Billingsley |first3=Brianna |last4=Tuttle |first4=Nathan |title=Performativity Double Standards and the Sexual Orientation Climate at a Southern Liberal Arts University |journal=Journal of Homosexuality |date=16 April 2017 |volume=64 |issue=5 |pages=671–696 |doi=10.1080/00918369.2016.1196994 |pmid=27267937 |s2cid=20963768 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCreery states that this heteronormative hierarchy carries over to the workplace, where gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals face discrimination such as anti-homosexual hiring policies or workplace discrimination that often leaves "lowest hierarchy" individuals such as transsexual people vulnerable to the most overt discrimination and unable to find work.&lt;ref name="OutatWork"/&gt;

Applicants and current employees can be legally passed over or fired for being non-heterosexual or perceived as non-heterosexual in many countries. An example of this practice is found in the case of the chain restaurant [[Cracker Barrel]], which [[Cracker Barrel#LGBT policies|garnered national attention in 1991]] after they fired an employee for being openly lesbian, citing their policy that employees with "sexual preferences that fail to demonstrate normal heterosexual values were inconsistent with traditional American values." Workers such as the fired employee and effeminate male waiters (allegedly described as the true targets),&lt;ref name="OutatWork"/&gt; were legally fired by work policies "transgressing" against "normal" heteronormative culture.&lt;ref name="OutatWork"/&gt; Another study indicates that heteronormativity extends to social media platforms as well. While these channels are often seen as "safe spaces" for LGBT individuals, they can also perpetuate heteronormative expectations from work that were previously confined to face-to-face interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lauriano |first=Lucas Amaral |date=11 February 2023 |title=Gay employees on social media: Strategies to portray professionalism |url=https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/28/2/zmad001/7034548 |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |volume=28 |issue=2|doi=10.1093/jcmc/zmad001 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mustafa Bilgehan Ozturk analyzes the interconnectivity of heteronormativity and sexual employment discrimination by tracing the impact of patriarchal practices and institutions on the workplace experiences of lesbian, gay, and bisexual employees in a variety of contexts in Turkey. This further demonstrates the specific historicity and localized power/knowledge formations that give rise to physical, professional, and psycho-emotive acts of prejudice against sexual minorities.&lt;ref name="SexualOrientationDiscrimination"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bilgehan Ozturk |first1=Mustafa |title=Sexual orientation discrimination: Exploring the experiences of lesbian, gay and bisexual employees in Turkey |journal=Human Relations |date=August 2011 |volume=64 |issue=8 |pages=1099–1118 |doi=10.1177/0018726710396249 |s2cid=59439253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Certain religions have been known to promote heteronormative beliefs through their teachings.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/homosexuality-and-religion|title=Homosexuality and Religion {{!}} SexInfo Online|website=www.soc.ucsb.edu|access-date=21 March 2019|archive-date=14 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190614100124/http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/homosexuality-and-religion|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sociology professors [[Samuel L. Perry|Samuel Perry]] and Kara Snawder from The University of Oklahoma, multiple research studies in the past have shown that there can be and often is a link between the religious beliefs of Americans and homophobic behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Perry |first1=Samuel L. |last2=Snawder |first2=Kara J. |title=Longitudinal Effects of Religious Media on Opposition to Same-Sex Marriage |journal=Sexuality &amp; Culture |date=December 2016 |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=785–804 |doi=10.1007/s12119-016-9357-y |s2cid=148173061 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the world's five major religions, the [[Abrahamic religions]]—Christianity, Judaism, and Islam—all uphold heteronormative views on marriage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some examples of this playing out in recent years include the incident involving Kentucky clerk [[Kim Davis]], who refused to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples on the grounds that it violated her spiritual views,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Blinder |first1=Alan |last2=Lewin |first2=Tamar |title=Clerk in Kentucky Chooses Jail Over Deal on Same-Sex Marriage |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/us/kim-davis-same-sex-marriage.html |work=The New York Times |date=3 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Supreme Court ruling that a Colorado baker did not have to provide a wedding cake for a gay couple based on his religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-111_new2_22p3.pdf|title=Masterpiece Cake Shop, LTD v.

=== Media representation ===
Five different studies have shown that gay characters appearing on TV decreases the prejudice among viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stelter |first1=Brian |title=Gay on TV: It's All in the Family |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/business/media/gay-on-tv-its-all-in-the-family.html |work=The New York Times |date=9 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cable and streaming services are beginning to include more characters who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender than broadcast television.&lt;ref name="Egner"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Egner |first1=Jeremy |title=More Gay and Transgender Characters Are on TV, Report Shows |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/arts/television/more-gay-and-transgender-characters-are-on-tv-report-shows.html |work=The New York Times |date=27 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cable and streaming services are lacking in diversity, according to a [[GLAAD]] report, with many of the LGBT characters being gay men (41% and 39% respectively).&lt;ref name="Egner"/&gt; The total number of LGBT characters counted on cable was reported to be 31% up from 2015, and bisexual representations saw an almost twofold increase.&lt;ref name="Egner" /&gt;

Intersex people are excluded almost completely from television, though about 1% of the population is intersex.&lt;ref name="Kerry, Stephen 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kerry |first1=Stephen |title=Representation of intersex in news media: the case of Kathleen Worrall |journal=Journal of Gender Studies |date=September 2011 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=263–277 |doi=10.1080/09589236.2011.593325 |s2cid=144222294 }}&lt;/ref&gt; News medias outline what it means to be male or female, which causes a gap for anyone who doesn't fall into those two categories.&lt;ref name="Kerry, Stephen 2011"/&gt; Newspapers have covered the topic of intersex athletes with the case of [[Caster Semenya]], where news spread of sporting officials having to determine whether she was to be considered female or male.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/08/20/gender.athlete.intersex/|title=Gender row athlete: What is intersexuality? |first= Stephanie |last=Busari|website=edition.cnn.com|access-date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
