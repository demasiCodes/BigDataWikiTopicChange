'''Heteronormativity''' is a term for a set of [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]s that hold that people fall into distinct and complementary [[gender]]s ([[male]] and [[female]]) with [[Essentialism#Essentialism_and_society_and_politics|natural roles in life]]. It also holds that [[heterosexuality]] is the normal [[sexual orientation]], and states that sexual and marital relations are most (or only) fitting between a man and a woman. Consequently, a "heteronormative" view is one that involves alignment of biological [[sex]], [[gender identity]], and [[gender role]]s.&lt;ref name=lovaas&gt;Lovaas, Karen, and Mercilee M. Jenkins. [http://books.google.com/books?isbn=1412914434 “Charting a Path through the ‘Desert of Nothing.’”] Sexualities and Communication in Everyday Life: A Reader. 8 July 2006. Sage Publications Inc. 5 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
[[Michael Warner]] coined the term in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;Warner, Michael (1991), "Introduction: Fear of a Queer Planet". ''Social Text''; 9 (4 [29]): 3–17&lt;/ref&gt; in one of the first major works of [[queer theory]].  The concept's roots are in [[Gayle Rubin]]'s notion of the "sex/gender system" and [[Adrienne Rich]]'s notion of [[Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence|compulsory heterosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrienne Rich]], ‘Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence’ ''Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society'', 5:631-60, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a series of articles, Samuel A. Chambers calls for an understanding of heteronormativity as a concept that reveals the expectations, demands, and constraints produced when heterosexuality is taken as normative within a society.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel A. Chambers, ‘Telepistemology of the Closet; Or, the Queer Politics of ''Six Feet Under''’. ''Journal of American Culture'' 26.1: 24–41, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel A. Chambers, "Revisiting the Closet: Reading Sexuality in ''Six Feet Under'', in ''Reading Six Feet Under''. McCabe and Akass, eds. IB Taurus, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- When and by who? What was the first usage? I've tried to edit to answer this question --&gt;  Originally conceived to describe the norms against which [[non-heterosexuals]] struggle, "heteronormativity" quickly became incorporated into both the [[gender]] and the [[transgender]] debate.&lt;ref name="Todd" /&gt;

==Discrimination==
Critics of heteronormative attitudes, such as [[Cathy J. Cohen]], [[Michael Warner]], and [[Lauren Berlant]] argue that they are oppressive, stigmatizing, marginalizing of perceived deviant forms of sexuality and gender, and make self-expression more difficult when that expression does not conform to the norm.&lt;ref name=lovaas /&gt;&lt;ref name="OutatWork"/&gt; This includes [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[asexual]], [[intersex]], [[transgender]] ([[LGBTQ]]) people, [[polygamy|polygamists]], [[polyamory|polyamorists]], as well as others such as racial minorities.&lt;ref name="Todd" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OutatWork"/&gt; Heteronormative culture "privileges heterosexuality as normal and natural" and fosters a climate where LGBTQ are discriminated against in marriage, tax codes, and employment.&lt;ref name="OutatWork"&gt;Krupat, Kitty; McCreery, Patrick. ''Out at Work: Building a Gay-Labor Alliance'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Against LGBTQ individuals===
According to cultural anthropologist [[Gayle Rubin]], heternormativity in mainstream society creates a "sex hierarchy" that gradates sexual practices from morally "good sex" to "bad sex." The hierarchy places reproductive, monogamous sex between committed heterosexuals as "good" and places any sexual acts and individuals who fall short of this standard lower until they fall into "bad sex." Specifically, this places long-term committed gay couples and promiscuous gays in between the two poles.&lt;ref name="thinkingsex"&gt;Rubin, Gayle. ''Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality'', in Vance, Carole. ''Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick McCreery, lecturer at [[New York University]], views this hierarchy as partially explanatory for the stigmatization of gay people for socially "deviant" sexual practices that are often practiced by straight people as well, such as consumption of pornography or sex in public places.&lt;ref name="OutatWork"/&gt;

McCreery states that this heteronormative hierarchy carries over to the workplace, where LGBTQ individuals face discrimination such as anti-homosexual hiring policies or workplace discrimination that often leaves "lowest hierarchy" individuals such as transsexuals vulnerable to the most overt discrimination and unable to find work.&lt;ref name="OutatWork"/&gt; 

Applicants and current employees can be legally passed over or fired for being non-heterosexual or ''perceived'' as non-heterosexual, such as the case with chain restaurant [[Cracker Barrel]], which [[Cracker_Barrel#Policy_of_discrimination_against_LGBT_employees|garnered national attention in 1991]] after they fired an employee for being openly lesbian, citing their policy that employees with "sexual preferences that fail to demonstrate normal heterosexual values were inconsistent with traditional American values." Workers such as the fired employee and others, such as effeminate male waiters (allegedly described as the true targets),&lt;ref name="OutatWork"/&gt; were legally fired by work policies "transgressing" against "normal" heteronormative culture.&lt;ref name="OutatWork"/&gt;

===Against racial and other minorities===
Some scholars have linked heteronormativity to issues of race. In a chapter published in the book ''Black Queer Studies'', Cathy J. Cohen, professor of [[political science]] at the [[University of Chicago]], argues that heteronormativity does not equally distribute privilege and power among heterosexuals, but favors white, upper and middle-class heterosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;Cathy J. Cohen. 'Punks, bulldaggers, and welfare queen: The radical potential of queer politics?' in ''Black Queer Studies''. E. Patrick Johnson and Mae G. Henderson, eds. Duke UP, 2005. 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garcia"&gt;{{cite journal |last=García|first=Lorena|year=2009|month=August|title="Now Why do you Want to Know about That?": Heteronormativity, Sexism, and Racism in the Sexual (Mis)education of Latina Youth |volume=7|pages=139–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; She links sexuality in broader structures of power, intersecting with and inseparable from race, gender, and "class oppression." She points to the examples of single mothers on welfare (particularly women of color) and sex workers, who may be heterosexual, but are not heteronormative, and thus not perceived as "normal, moral, or worthy of state support" or legitimation.&lt;ref&gt;Cathy J. Cohen. 'Punks, bulldaggers, and welfare queen: The radical potential of queer politics?' in ''Black Queer Studies''. E. Patrick Johnson and Mae G. Henderson, eds. Duke UP, 2005. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

In her research with sexual education among Latina youth, Lorena García agreed that heteronormativity resulted in unequal privilege stratified by race, drawing a connection between racism, heteronormativity, and sexism.&lt;ref name="Garcia"/&gt; She found that heteronormative sexual education often utilized a "racial lens" that typified Latina girls as "excessively reproductive" compared to their white counterparts and "thus nonconforming to idealized heteronormative standards" resulting in sexual education that constructed Latina girls as "at risk."&lt;ref name="Garcia"/&gt;  

Likewise, Patrick McCreery suggests that heteronormativity not only discriminates against the LGBTQ community, but people of color as well, reinforcing perceptions of people of color being "sexually suspect" or "irretrievably libidinous."&lt;ref name="OutatWork"/&gt; McCreery links consequences of heteronormative hierarchy for racial minorities to the workplace as well, stating that it contributes to workplace discrimination where "monogamous straight (white) folks" experience the least discrimination because of their sexuality.

==Relation to marriage and the nuclear family==
Modern family structures in the past and present vary from what was typical of the 1950s [[nuclear family]].  The families of the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century in the United States were characterized by the death of one or both parents for many American children.&lt;ref name="Coontz"&gt;Coontz, S. (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, the United States is estimated to have been home to approximately 2.5 million post-divorce, [[stepfamily]] households containing children.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, M., Ganong, L. H., &amp; Goodwin, C.  (1994).  "The presentation of stepfamilies in marriage and family textbooks:  A reexamination".  Family Relations 45, 289–297.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the late 80s, almost 20% of families with children headed by a married couple were [[stepfamilies]].&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Ganong, &amp; Goodwin, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past three decades rates of divorce, single parenting, and cohabitation have risen precipitously.&lt;ref name="Benfer"&gt;Benfer, Amy. [http://archive.salon.com/mwt/feature/2001/06/07/family_values/index.html The Nuclear Family Takes a Hit], Salon.com.  June 7, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Nontraditional families (which diverge from "a middle-class family with a bread-winning father and a stay-at-home mother, married to each other and raising their biological children") constitute the majority of families in the [[United States]] today.&lt;ref name="Benfer"/&gt;  Modern families may have single-parent headed families caused by divorce or separation, families who have two parents who are not married but have children, or families with same-sex parents. With [[artificial insemination]], [[surrogate mother]]s, and [[adoption]], families do not have to be formed by the heteronormative biological union of a male and a female.  Heteronormative culture "privileges heterosexuality as normal and natural" and fosters a climate where LGBTQ are discriminated against in marriage, tax codes, and employment.&lt;ref name="OutatWork"/&gt;

The consequences of these changes for the adults and children involved are heavily debated. In a 2009 [[Massachusetts]] spousal benefits case, developmental psychologist [[Michael Lamb (psychologist)|Michael Lamb]] testified that parental sexual orientation does not negatively affect childhood development. "Since the end of the 1980’s... it has been well established that children and adolescents can adjust just as well in nontraditional settings as in traditional settings," he argued.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lamb, Ph.D.: [http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/2009-11-17-doma-aff-lamb.pdf Affidavit – United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, conservative columnist [[Maggie Gallagher]] argues that heteronormative social structures are beneficial to society because they are optimal for the raising of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/gallagher200407130859.asp |title=Marriage Matters |author=Maggie Gallagher |publisher=The National Review |date=2004-07-13 |accessdate=2009-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Australian-Canadian ethicist [[Margaret Somerville]] argues that "giving same-sex couples the right to found a family unlinks parenthood from biology".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unisa.edu.au/hawkecentre/events/2007events/MSomerville_InConversation.asp Margaret Somerville – In Conversation]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intersex people===
[[intersexuality|Intersex]] people have biological characteristics that are ambiguously either male or female. If such a condition is detected, intersex people in most present-day societies are almost always assigned a normative sex shortly after birth.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling, Anne. 2000. Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Surgery (usually involving modification to the genitalia) is often performed in an attempt to produce an unambiguously male or female body, with the parents'—rather than the individual's—consent.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith. 2004. Undoing Gender. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The child is then usually raised and enculturated as a [[cisgender]]ed member of the assigned sex, which may or may not match their emergent [[gender identity]] throughout life or some remaining [[sex-determination system|sex characteristics]] (for example, chromosomes, genes or internal sex organs).&lt;ref&gt;Wilchins, Riki. 2002. 'A certain kind of freedom: power and the truth of bodies – four essays on gender.' In GenderQueer: Voices from beyond the sexual binary. Los Angeles: Alyson Books 23–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases homosexuals were forced to undergo sex change treatments to "fix" their sex or gender: in [[Europe]] during the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2660/ The Unkindest Cut | The science and ethics of castration]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/turing_a,2.html Turing, Alan (1912–1954)]&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[South Africa]] in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2000/jul/29/chrismcgreal Gays tell of mutilation by apartheid army]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transgender people===
Some [[transgender]] people seek [[sex reassignment therapy]]. They may not develop a [[gender identity]] that corresponds to their body or a gender identity that is plainly male or female. Transgender people may not behave according to the ''gender role'' imposed by society. Some societies consider transgender behavior a crime worthy of capital punishment, including [[Saudi Arabia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifge.org/news/1998/sept/nws9278.htm Saudis Arrest 5 Pakistani TGs]&lt;/ref&gt; and many other nations.

In some countries, including North American&lt;ref name="cider"/&gt; and European countries, certain forms of violence against transgender people may be tacitly endorsed when prosecutors and juries refuse to investigate, prosecute, or convict those who perform the murders and beatings (currently, in some parts of North America and Europe).&lt;ref name="cider"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frye|first=Phyllis|year=2000|month=Fall|title=The International Bill of Gender Rights vs. The Cide House Rules: Transgenders struggle with the courts over what clothing they are allowed to wear on the job, which restroom they are allowed to use on the job, their right to marry, and the very definition of their sex|journal=William and Mary Journal of Women and the Law|volume=7|pages=139–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AmnestyUSA"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/outfront/jamaica_report.html|title=OUTfront! Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Human Rights:"Battybwoys affi dead" Action against homophobia in Jamaica|date=May 7, 2004|publisher=AmnestyUSA.org|accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=276 SPLCenter.org: 'Disposable People'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Other societies have considered transgender behavior as a [[psychiatric illness]] serious enough to justify [[institutionalization]].

In medical communities with these restrictions, patients have the option of either suppressing transsexual behavior and conforming to the norms of their birth sex (which may be necessary to avoid social stigma or even violence) or by adhering strictly to the norms of their "new" sex in order to qualify for sex reassignment surgery and hormonal treatments—if any treatment is offered at all.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} These norms might include dress and mannerisms, choice of occupation, choice of hobbies, and the gender of one's mate (heterosexuality required).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} (For example, transwomen might be expected to trade a "masculine" job for a more "feminine" one—e.g. become a secretary instead of a lawyer.) Attempts to achieve an ambiguous or "alternative" gender identity would not be supported or allowed.&lt;ref name="Todd"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weiss |first=Jillian Todd |title=The Gender Caste System: Identity, Privacy and Heteronormativity |publisher=Tulane Law School |year=2001 |url=http://phobos.ramapo.edu/~jweiss/tulane.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2007-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many governments and official agencies have also been criticized{{By whom|date=May 2010}} as having heteronormative systems that classify people into "male" and "female" genders in problematic ways.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Different jurisdictions use different definitions of gender, including by genitalia, DNA, hormone levels (including some official sports bodies), or birth sex (which means one's gender cannot ever be officially changed). Sometimes sex reassignment surgery is a requirement for an official gender change, and often "male" and "female" are the only choices available, even for [[intersex]] and transgender people.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Morning Herald, March 18, 2010, Chi Tranter, "Norrie's 'ungendered' status withdrawn", http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/norries-ungendered-status-withdrawn-20100318-qhw5.html&lt;/ref&gt; Because most governments allow only heterosexual marriages, official gender changes can have implications for related rights and privileges, such as child custody, inheritance, and medical decision-making.&lt;ref name="Todd" /&gt;

==Homonormativity==
Homonormativity is the assimilation of heteronormative ideals and constructs into [[LGBTQ]] culture and individual identity.  The term was used prominently by Lisa Duggan in 2003,&lt;ref name="Duggan, Lisa 2003"&gt;Duggan, Lisa. The Twilight of Equality?: Neoliberalism, Cultural Politics, and the Attack On Democracy. Beacon Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; although transgender studies scholar Susan Stryker has noted that it was also used by transgender activists in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Stryker, Susan 2008"&gt;Stryker, Susan.  2008. "Transgender History, Homonormativity, and Disciplinarity". Radical History Review. (100): 145-157.&lt;/ref&gt;   According to Penny Griffin, Politics and International Relations lecturer at the [[University of New South Wales]], homonormativity upholds [[neoliberalism]] rather than critiquing monogamy, procreation, and binary gender roles as [[heterosexist]] and [[racist]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Penny. “Sexing the Economy in a Neo-liberal World Order: Neo-liberal Discourse and the (Re)Production of Heteronormative Heterosexuality.” British Journal of Politics and International Relations 9.2 (2007): 220–238. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. MCTC LIBRARY. 30 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Duggan asserts that homonormativity fragments LGBTQ communities into hierarchies of worthiness. LGBTQ people that come the closest to mimicking heteronormative standards of gender identity are deemed most worthy of receiving rights. LGBTQ individuals at the bottom of the hierarchy ([[transsexuals]], [[transvestites]], [[intersex]], [[bisexuals]], non-gender identified) are seen as an impediment to this elite class of homonormative individuals receiving their rights.&lt;ref name="Duggan, Lisa 2003"/&gt;
