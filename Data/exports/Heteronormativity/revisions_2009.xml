Consequently, a ''heteronormative'' view is one that promotes alignment of biological [[sex]], [[gender identity]], and [[gender role]]s to the [[gender binary]].&lt;ref name=lovaas&gt;Lovaas, Karen, and Mercilee M. Jenkins. “Charting a Path through the ‘Desert of

Those who identify and criticize heteronormativity say that it distorts [[discourse]] by [[Social stigma|stigmatizing]] and [[Marginalization|marginalizing]] some forms of sexuality and gender, and makes certain types of self-expression more difficult when that expression violates the norm.&lt;ref name=lovaas /&gt;  [[Non-heterosexual]] and [[gender-variant]] people who transgress heteronormativity include [[homosexual]], [[bisexual]], [[asexual]], [[intersex]], and [[transgender]] people in addition to people who are married to or form pair-bonds with more than one partner such as [[polygamy|polygamists]] or [[polyamory|polyamorists]].&lt;ref name="Todd" /&gt;

==Origin of term==
[[Michael Warner]] coined the term "heteronormativity" in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;Warner, Michael (1991), "Introduction: Fear of a Queer Planet". ''Social Text''; 9 (4 [29]): 3-17&lt;/ref&gt; in one of the first major works of [[queer theory]].  The concept's roots are in [[Gayle Rubin]]'s notion of the "sex/gender system" and [[Adrienne Rich]]'s notion of [[Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence|compulsory heterosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrienne Rich]], ‘Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence’ ''Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society'', 5:631-60, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of articles, [[Samuel A. Chambers]] calls for an understanding of heteronormativity as a concept that reveals the expectations, demands, and constraints produced when heterosexuality is taken as normative within a society.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel A. Chambers, ‘Telepistemology of the Closet; Or, the Queer Politics of ''Six Feet Under''’. ''Journal of American Culture'' 26.1: 24-41, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel A. Chambers, "Revisiting the Closet: Reading Sexuality in ''Six Feet Under'', in ''Reading Six Feet Under''. McCabe and Akass, eds. IB Taurus, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- When and by who? What was the first usage? I've tried to edit to answer this question --&gt; 

[[Cathy J. Cohen]] defines heteronormativity as the practices and institutions "that legitimize and privilege heterosexuality and heterosexual relationships as fundamental and 'natural' within society".&lt;ref&gt;Cathy J. Cohen. 'Punks, bulldaggers, and welfare queen: The radical potential of queer politics?' in ''Black Queer Studies''. E. Patrick Johnson and Mae G. Henderson, eds. Duke UP, 2005. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Her work emphasizes the importance of sexuality as implicated in broader structures of power, intersecting with and inseparable from race, gender, and class oppression. She points to the examples of single mothers on welfare (particularly women of color) and sex workers, who may be heterosexual, but are not heteronormative, and thus not perceived as "normal, moral, or worthy of state support" or legitimation.&lt;ref&gt;Cathy J. Cohen. 'Punks, bulldaggers, and welfare queen: The radical potential of queer politics?' in ''Black Queer Studies''. E. Patrick Johnson and Mae G. Henderson, eds. Duke UP, 2005. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Heteronormativity has been used in the exploration and critique of the traditional [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s of [[sex]], [[gender identity]], [[gender role]]s and [[human sexuality|sexuality]], and of the social implications of those institutions. It describes a direct linkage between one's social behavior/self-identification with their genitalia. That is to say (among other things) that, because there are strictly defined concepts of maleness and femaleness, there are similarly expected behaviors for both males and females. 

Originally conceived to describe the norms against which [[non-heterosexuals]] struggle, it quickly became incorporated into both the [[gender]] and the [[transgender]] debate.&lt;ref name="Todd" /&gt; It is also often used in [[postmodernist]] and [[feminist]] debates. &lt;!-- Some examples of its incorporation into these debates is important --&gt; Those who use this concept frequently point to the difficulty posed to those who hold a dichotomous view of sexuality by the presence of clear exceptions—from [[freemartin]]s in the bovine world to [[intersexual]] human beings with the sexual characteristics of both sexes. These exceptions are taken as direct evidence that neither sex nor gender are concepts that can be reduced to an either/or proposition.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In a heteronormative society, the binary choice of male and female for one's [[gender identity]] is viewed as leading to a lack of possible choice about one's gender role and sexual identity. Also, included in the norms established by society for both genders is the requirement that the individuals should feel and express desire only for partners of ''the opposite'' sex. In the work of [[Eve Sedgwick]], for example, this heteronormative pairing is viewed as defining sexual orientation exclusively in terms of the sex and gender of the person one chooses to have sex with, ignoring other preferences one might have about sex.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]], ''The Epistemology of the Closet''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The heteronormative nuclear family in the present==

The family structures observed today can often vary significantly from what was typical in the 1950s.  Some {{Who|date=December 2008}}  might argue that heteronormativity is a term of the past due to our ever-changing world and how in and outside of the media people are living with and experiencing a different type of family, one that is based outside of the norms of a nuclear family.  In Amy Benfer’s article, “The Nuclear Family Takes a Hit,” she specifies how our present society is beginning to shift from the past. “Everything has changed: In the past three decades the rates of divorce, single parenting and cohabitation have risen precipitously (Benfer).”&lt;ref&gt;Benfer, Amy. [http://archive.salon.com/mwt/feature/2001/06/07/family_values/index.html The Nuclear Family Takes a Hit], Salon.com.  June 7, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern families may have single-parent headed families caused by divorce or separation, families who have two parents who are not married but have kids, or families with same-sexed parents. With [[artificial insemination]], [[surrogate mother]]s, and [[adoption]], families do not have to be formed by the heteronormative biological union of a male and a female.  

==Social and political manifestations of heteronormativity==

===Intersex people===
{{Refimprove|date=August 2009}}
[[intersexuality|Intersex]] people have biological characteristics which are ambiguously either male or female. If such a condition is detected, intersex people are almost always assigned a normative sex shortly after birth. Surgery (usually involving modification to the genitalia) is often performed to produce an unambiguously male or female body, with the parents', not the individual's, consent. The child is then usually raised and enculturated as a cisgendered member of the assigned sex, which may or may not match their [[gender identity]] throughout life or some remaining [[sex-determination system|sex characteristics]] (for example, genes or internal sex organs).

===Non-heterosexual people===

Non-[[heterosexual]] sexual behavior is commonly disapproved of in many societies, both socially and legally. Many argue that this is because it challenges the heteronormative position that sexual relations exist primarily for reproductive means.  If sex cannot be suppressed so far as to at least disappear from the public view, then the notion is said to be encouraged that gay men are not really "men", but have a strong female component (and vice versa), or that in a non-heterosexual partnership there is always a "male" (active) and a "female" (passive) partner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_fixe.htm Divergent beliefs about the nature of homosexuality]&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases homosexuals were forced to undergo sex change treatments to "fix" their sex or gender: in [[Europe]] during the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2660/ The Unkindest Cut | The science and ethics of castration]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/turing_a,2.html Turing, Alan (1912-1954)]&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[South Africa]] in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2000/jul/29/chrismcgreal Gays tell of mutilation by apartheid army]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transgender people===
Some [[transgender]]ed people seek [[sex reassignment therapy]], conflicting with the assumption{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} of unambiguous female or male. They may not develop a ''gender identity'' that corresponds to their body or a gender identity that is plainly male ''or'' female. Transgender people may not behave according to the ''gender role'' imposed by society.
Some societies consider transgender behavior a crime worthy of capital punishment, including [[Saudi Arabia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifge.org/news/1998/sept/nws9278.htm Saudis Arrest 5 Pakistani TGs]&lt;/ref&gt; and many other nations. Yet the stereotype that transgender people are not accepted in non-western nations is not entirely accurate- The Cuban and Iranian governments now both fund gender affirmation surgeries for trans people within a heterosexist model{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} (i.e. only those people who will be heterosexual in their identified gender), while trans people in the United States continue to fight for insurance coverage of their gender-related surgeries.  In other countries, certain forms of violence against transgender people may be tacitly endorsed when prosecutors and juries refuse to investigate, prosecute, or convict those who perform the murders and beatings (currently, in some parts of North America and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gender.org/remember/index.html# Remembering Our Dead&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=276 SPLCenter.org: 'Disposable People'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Other societies have considered transgender behavior as a [[psychiatric illness]] serious enough to justify [[institutionalization]].

Certain restrictions on the ability of transgender people to obtain gender-related medical treatment have been blamed on heteronormativity. (See the article on [[transsexualism]].) In medical communities with these restrictions, patients have the option of either suppressing transsexual behavior and conforming to the norms of their birth sex (which may be necessary to avoid social stigma or even violence), or adhering strictly to the norms of their "new" sex in order to qualify for sex reassignment surgery and hormonal treatments—if any treatment is offered at all. These norms might include dress and mannerisms, choice of occupation, choice of hobbies, and the gender of one's mate (heterosexuality required). (For example, transwomen might be expected to trade a "masculine" job for a more "feminine" one—e.g. become a secretary instead of a lawyer.) Attempts to achieve an ambiguous or "alternative" gender identity would not be supported or allowed.&lt;ref name="Todd"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weiss |first=Jillian Todd |title=The Gender Caste System: Identity, Privacy and Heteronormativity |publisher=Tulane Law School |year=2001 |url=http://phobos.ramapo.edu/~jweiss/tulane.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2007-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many governments and official agencies have also been criticized as having heteronormative systems that classify people into "male" and "female" genders in problematic ways. Different jurisdictions use different definitions of gender, including by genitalia, DNA, hormone levels (including some official sports bodies), or birth sex (which means one's gender cannot ever be officially changed). Sometimes sex reassignment surgery is a requirement for an official gender change, and often "male" and "female" are the only choices available, even for [[intersex]] and transgender people. Because most governments allow only heterosexual marriages, official gender changes can have implications for related rights and privileges, such as child custody, inheritance, and medical decision-making.&lt;ref name="Todd" /&gt;

==Homonormativity==
Homonormativity is the assimilation of heteronormative ideals and constructs into [[homosexual]] culture and individual identity. Homonormativity upholds [[neoliberalism]] rather than critiquing monogamy, procreation and binary gender roles as [[heterosexist]] and [[racist]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Penny. “Sexing the Economy in a Neo-liberal World Order: Neo-liberal Discourse and the (Re)Production of Heteronormative Heterosexuality.” British Journal of Politics and International Relations 9.2 (2007): 220-238. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. MCTC LIBRARY. 30 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Homonormativity fragments the [[GLBTQ]] community into hierarchies of worthiness. GLBTQ people that come the closest to mimicking heteronormative standards of gender identity are deemed most worthy of receiving rights. GLBTQ individuals at the bottom of the hierarchy ([[Transsexuals]], [[Transvestites]], [[Intersex]], non-gender identified, [[queer]] individuals) are seen as an impediment to this elite class of homonormative individuals receiving their rights.&lt;ref&gt;Duggan, Lisa. The Twilight of Equality? : Neoliberalism, Cultural Politics, and the Attack On Democracy. Beacon Press. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy about the concept of heteronormativity==
Challenges to the label "heteronormative" may result from a belief that the description of a structure as heteronormative implies that the normative structure is inherently wrong.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} One of the most common criticisms of the concept of heteronormativity is that it is based on a purported desire to be [[political correctness|politically correct]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} An example of this was a footnote to a [[March 11]], [[2005]], opinion article by Scott Norvell of [[Fox News]] which included a segment on a controversy over comments made by actress [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] at [[Harvard University]], describing said controversy as "politically correct nuttiness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,149573,00.html FOXNews.com - Heteronormative Harassment, No Ladies Allowed - Blog | Blogs | Popular Blogs | Video Blogs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Such criticism implies that the use of such carefully chosen wording and terms is a form of repression of speech, and that the articulation of important concepts is prevented or hindered by politically correct regulation of speech by intellectual elites. {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Responses from those with heteronormative attitudes to individuals and groups who depart from heteronormative experience may range from tolerance, pity, and shunning to attempts to help members of these groups "gain normalcy" through compassionate, forceful, or violent means. Events which have brought the idea of heteronormativity more into the foreground of social discourse, such as the Jada Pinkett Smith speech, do not necessarily represent such treatment. Ms. Pinkett Smith's comments were not necessarily homophobic in that they did not represent active criticism of [[LGBTI]] people. However, her comments were heteronormative in that they made the assumption that normal relationships are only those which occur between a man and a woman. Critics that describe her speech as heteronormative stated, "Our position is that the comments weren’t homophobic, but the content was specific to male-female relationships."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=506104 The Harvard Crimson :: News :: Pinkett Smith’s Remarks Debated&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
