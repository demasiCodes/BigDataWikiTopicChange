Various forms of racism are practiced in most countries on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engACT400202001 |publisher=Amnesty International |title=Racism and the administration of justice |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041227005600/http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engACT400202001 |archivedate=December 27, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In individual countries, the forms of racism which are practiced may be motivated by historic, cultural, religious, economic or demographic reasons. Wars created sentiments of ultra-nationalism, ethnic pride and racism.

Racism is widely condemned throughout the world, with 88 states being signatories of the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] {{as of|2013|3|7|lc=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-2&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en|title=STATUS AS AT : 07-03-2013 05:04:14 EDT : International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|publisher=[[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
