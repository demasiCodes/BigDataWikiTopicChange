'''Discrimination based on skin color''', also known as '''colorism''' or '''shadeism''', is a form of [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]] usually from members of the same race in which people are treated differently based on the social implications from cultural  meanings attached to [[Human skin color|skin color]].&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = Trina | year = 2001 | title = Shades of Brown: The Law of Skin Color | url = http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&amp;context=dlj| journal = Duke Law Journal | volume = 49 | issue = 1487 | pages = | doi = 10.2139/ssrn.233850 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When people think of racism it's usually against people outside of their ethnicity. Colorism is discrimination against African Americans because they have a dark complexion. The idea of racism and colorism are pretty similar. Someone with a light complexion is considered to be more beautiful or valuable than someone with dark skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://racism.org/index.php/articles/law-and-justice/citizenship-rights/116-slavery-to-reparations/racial-reentrenchment/1707-colorism001|title='Color Struck': Intragroup and Cross-racial Color Discrimination|last=Ware|first=Leland|website=Race, Racism and the Law|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found extensive evidence of discrimination based on skin color in [[criminal justice]], [[business]], the [[Economic discrimination|economy]], [[housing]], [[health care]], [[Mass media|media]], and [[politics]] in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. Lighter skin tones are seen as preferable in many countries in [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[South America]].

==Asia==

=== East and South Asia ===
In [[East Asia|East]], [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]], a preference for lighter skin is prevalent,&lt;ref name="Skin Deep: Dying to be White"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/east/05/13/asia.whitening/|title=Skin Deep: Dying to be White|date=2002-05-15|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2010-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in countries such as [[China]], [[South Korea]], [[India]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=P.H.|first=Li, Eric|last2=Jeong|first2=Min, Hyun|last3=W.|first3=Belk, Russell|date=2008-01-01|title=Skin Lightening and Beauty in Four Asian Cultures|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/13415/volumes/v35/NA-35|journal=NA - Advances in Consumer Research| volume = 35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/feminism/2016/01/dark-what-behind-india-s-obsession-skin-whitening|title=In the dark: what is behind India's obsession with skin whitening?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of [[skin whitening]] in East Asia dates far back to ancient times. In the ancient dynastic eras, to be light in an environment in which the sun was harsh implied wealth and nobility because those individuals were able to remain indoors while servants had to labor outside.&lt;ref name="Skin Deep: Dying to be White" /&gt; Ancient Asian cultures also associated light skin with feminine beauty. "Jade" white skin in Korea is known to have been the ideal as far back as the [[Gojoseon|Gojoseon era]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Japan's [[Edo period]] saw the start of a trend of women whitening their faces with rice powder as a "moral duty".&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Chinese women valued a "milk white" complexion and swallowed powdered pearls towards that end.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Four out of ten women surveyed in [[Hong Kong]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], and [[South Korea]] use a skin whitening cream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2009-03-30/skin-whitening-big-business-asia|title=Skin whitening big business in Asia|date=30 March 2009|publisher=Public Radio International}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many Asian cultures, colorism is taught to children in the form of fairy tales, just as the Grimms' fairy tales featured light-skinned [[princess]]es or [[maiden]]s; Asian mythological protagonists are typically fair and depict virtue, purity, and goodness. A light complexion is equated with feminine beauty, racial superiority, and power, and continues to have strong influences on marital prospects, employment, status, and income.&lt;ref name="Verma2011"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Verma, Harsh| title=Skin 'fairness'-Culturally Embedded Meaning and Branding Implications| journal=Global Business Review| volume=12| issue=2| year=2011| pages=193–211| doi=10.1177/097215091101200202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalized East Asia still retains these biases, but they are compounded by the influence of Westernized beauty ideals and media that equate whiteness with modern and urban wealth and success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Framing the Bride: Globalizing Beauty and Romance in Taiwan's Bridal Industry|last=Adrian|first=Bonnie|publisher=University of California Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-520-23833-6|location=|pages=147–179|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legacies of European colonialism in India and [[Pakistan]] also influence the modern relations between light skin and power.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

====India====

Colorism in India has also been fueled due to the events under [[British Raj|British colonial rule]], where British officials consistently demeaned dark-skinned Indians and favored light-skinned Indians for jobs over dark-skinned Indians.&lt;ref name="cmc.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cmc.edu/keck-center/asia-experts-forum/radhika-parameswaran-on-colorism-in-india|title=Radhika Parameswaran on 'colorism' in India|website=cmc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of hundreds of years of British colonial influence, remnants of the British tactics that exacerbated colorism still remain in Indian society.&lt;ref&gt;Savita Malik, The Domination of Fair Skin: Skin Whitening, Indian Women and Public Health, San Francisco State University Department of Health Education (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of colorism in India can be seen in the cosmetic industry, where "fairness" creams meant to lighten skin are popular,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fairandlovely.in|title=header test|website=fairandlovely-in}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Bollywood]] industry, where the majority of [[actor]]s and [[actress]]es hired are light-skinned, and actresses are often [[photoshop]]ped to look lighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/aug/14/indias-dark-obsession-fair-skin|title=India's unfair obsession with lighter skin|first=Monisha|last=Rajesh|date=14 August 2013|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in the state of [[Maharashtra]], a group of young tribal{{When defined as|date=September 2019}} girls trained to be flight crew through a government scholarship program that aimed to empower women. The majority of girls were denied employment due to their darker skin tone. A few of those women obtained jobs, but only as out-of-sight ground crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Impact of Colorism on the Career Aspirations and Career Opportunities of Women in India|journal=[[Advances in Developing Human Resources]]|volume=18|issue=I|pages=38–53|doi=10.1177/1523422315616339|year=2015 | last1 = Sims | first1 = Cynthia | last2 = Hirudayaraj | first2 = Malar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pakistan ====
Pakistan is largely known for their attention and susceptibility to colorism. It is considered extremely normal to use skin whitening creams as they are very popular among the people of Pakistan, especially the women. The media is a big influence on how they view themselves and have come about favoring lighter skin over darker. Between being exposed to constant ads for skin whitening creams (such as [[Fair &amp; Lovely (cosmetics)|Fair and Lovely]]), to seeing Bollywood actors with light skin portrayed as good role models and dark skinned actors as poor models, many people from Pakistan have been heavily affected into achieving a fair complexion, which includes staying out of the sunlight as much as possible. Although Pakistan isn't the only country that faces these challenges, this is just one way that colorism can affect cultures and whole communities' perspectives upon themselves and their self-worth, especially when it results in serious divisions within families with different skin complexions.

==== Sri Lanka ====
Fair skin is a beauty ideal in contemporary Sri Lankan society but has its roots in ancient Sri Lankan beauty ideals. Fairness products and other products that include whitening agents are commonly sold in Sri Lanka and are popular among females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Fair-skin-obsession-An-inferiority-complex-that-needs-treatment-123403.html|title=Fair skin obsession: An inferiority complex that needs treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fair skinned actors and actresses feature prominently in [[Bollywood]] films and [[Korean drama]]s both of which are widely popular and influential in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://djedpress.com/2018/07/31/unfairandlovely-in-sri-lanka/|title=When Fair isn't fair and Lovely isn't lovely in Sri Lanka - Djed|date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== China and Japan ====
Hiroshi Wagatsuma writes in [[Daedalus (journal)|''Daedalus'']] that Japanese culture has long associated [[Human skin color|skin color]] with other physical characteristics that signify degrees of spiritual refinement or of primitiveness.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The scholar repeats an old Japanese proverb: "white skin makes up for seven defects."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; More specifically for a woman, very light skin allows people to overlook her lack of other desired physical characteristics.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Skin color has and continues to influence attractiveness and socioeconomic status and capability.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

People in the western hemisphere have long characterised east Asians, specifically Chinese and Japanese people, as "yellow", but the Chinese and Japanese seldom describe their skin color in that way.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The Japanese traditionally used the word ''shiroi'' – meaning "white" – to describe the lighter shades of skin in their society.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The court ladies of Japan during the [[Nara period]] from 710 to 793 AD applied a large amount of white powder to the face and added red rosy cheeks.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Many references to plump women with [[White Skin|white skin]] appear in both drawings and writings from 794–1186 AD.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In literature, note for example ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' (written {{circa}} 1000–1012) by [[Murasaki Shikibu|Lady Murasaki]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==== Malaysia ====
A survey concluded that three quarters of Malaysian men thought their partners would be more attractive if they had lighter skin complexions.&lt;ref name="Skin Deep: Dying to be White" /&gt;

In certain Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, a common beauty ideal is the "[[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian look]]" known locally in Malaysia as the "pan-Asian look" is an ideal that stems from the beauty ideal of fair skin, which Eurasians tend to naturally possess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1053286/miss-universe-malaysia-pageant-contestants-look-too-western|title=Miss Universe Malaysia pageant contestants 'look too western'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overuse of pan-Asian faces on billboards and on television screens has been a controversial issue in the country. The issue was highlighted in 2009 when [[Zainuddin Maidin]], a Malaysian politician, called for the reduction of pan-Asian faces which he claimed dominate TV and billboards and instead increase the number of Malay, Chinese and Indian faces on local television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2007-02/09/content_805345.htm|title=Malaysian ads move triggers industry row}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the controversy surrounding the preference for Malaysians who are of mixed Asian (Malay, Chinese or Indian) and European descent who possess features such as fair skin, some experts in the industry have said the use of pan-Asian faces can be used to promote the racial diversity of Malaysians. They can also be used to promote a product towards a diverse racial demographic because of their mixed appearance, which the Minister of Information had suggested in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqIzh1StFiwC&amp;pg=PA153|title=Buying and Believing: Sri Lankan Advertising and Consumers in a Transnational World|first=Steven|last=Kemper|date=1 May 2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=153|isbn=9780226430409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Africa ==
In many parts of Africa, women with lighter skin are thought to be more beautiful and likely to find more success than women of darker skin tones.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-20444798 | title=Africa: Where black is not really beautiful| work=BBC News| date=January 2013| last1=Fihlani| first1=Pumza}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often this barrier leads to women turning to skin lightening treatments, many of which are harmful to the body.

Historically, the cause of skin lightening goes back to colonialism, where individuals with lighter skin received greater privilege than those of darker tones.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.4081/jphia.2016.552| pmid=28299156| pmc=5345401|title = Fifty shades of African lightness: A bio-psychosocial review of the global phenomenon of skin lightening practices| journal=Journal of Public Health in Africa| volume=7| issue=2| pages=552|year = 2016|last1 = Jacobs|first1 = Meagan| last2=Levine| first2=Susan| last3=Abney| first3=Kate| last4=Davids| first4=Lester}}&lt;/ref&gt; This built a racial hierarchy and color ranking within colonized African nations, leaving psychological effects on many of the darker skinned individuals.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

Colorism affects both women and men in African countries, but it has taken hold of the beauty standards associated with a woman's ability to find success and marriage. The number of women across African countries using bleaching products have gone up with 77% of [[Nigeria]]n women, 52% of [[Senegal]]ese women, and 25% of [[Mali]]an women using lightening products.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

=== Chile ===
In Chile, there is a wide range of diversity from other cultures and ethnic backgrounds. The diversity in Chile sees colorism through social-economic status, accommodating the preexisting notion that darker skin complexions are less valued. A 2016 study found that [[Chile]]an schoolteachers had lower expectations of their dark-skinned students (''morenos'') than their light-skinned students (''blancos'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ceppe.uc.cl/index.php/ceppe-en-la-prensa/591-estudio-revela-que-alumnos-de-piel-morena-son-considerados-como-menos-competentes-en-los-colegios-chilenos|title=Estudio revela que alumnos de piel morena son considerados como 'menos competentes' en los colegios chilenos|website=Centro de Estudios de Políticas y Prácticas en Educación CEPPE de la U.

Current studies have been finding that many Chileans favor to be lighter in pigmentation and even perceive themselves to be White despite a mixture of skin tones.

==United States ==
===History===
[[European colonialism]] created a system of [[white supremacy|racial hierarchy]] and race-based [[ideology]], which had led to a structure of domination that privileged whites over blacks. Biological differences in skin color were used as a justification for the enslavement and oppression of Africans and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]; developing a social hierarchy that placed whites at the top and blacks at the bottom. Slaves with lighter complexion were allowed to engage in less strenuous tasks, like domestic duties, while the darker slaves participated in hard labor, which was more than likely outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hill | first1 = Mark E | year = 2002 | title = Skin Color and the Perception of Attractiveness Among African Americans: Does Gender Make a Difference? | url = | journal = Social Psychology Quarterly | volume = 65 | issue = 1| pages = 77–91 | doi=10.2307/3090169| jstor = 3090169 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

African-Americans with a partial white heritage were seen to be smarter and superior to dark-skinned blacks, giving them broader opportunities for education and the acquisition of land and property.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, K., Wilson, M., &amp; Hall, R. (1993). The color complex: The politics of skin color among African Americans. New York: Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Colorism was a device used by the white colonist in order to create a division between the Africans and further the idea that being as close to white as possible was the ideal image. One of the first forms of colorism was the white slave owners deciding that only the light skinned slaves would work in the house while the darker ones were subjected to the harsh conditions of the fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fultz|first=Lauren|date=Summer 2017|title=THE PSYCHO-SOCIAL IMPACT OF COLORISM AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN: CROSSING THE DIVIDE|url=http://corescholar.libraries.wright.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1909&amp;context=etd_all|journal=Psychology Commons|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a clear division between the slaves There were tests to determine who was light enough to work in the house and sometimes get special privileges. One of these tests was the [[Brown Paper Bag Test|brown paper bag test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ferris.edu/HTMLS/news/jimcrow/question/2014/february.htm|title=Brown Paper Bag Test - 2014 - Question of the Month - Jim Crow Museum - Ferris State University|website=ferris.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person's skin was darker than a brown paper bag, they were deemed too dark to work in the house. The skin tests were not just used by white people trying to differentiate between black people, but also by the black people themselves. In addition to the bag test, the comb test and the door test were also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://askmeaboutmyhair.com/testing-blackness/|title=Testing Blackness - Ask Me About My Hair (.com)|date=2014-02-10|work=Ask Me About My Hair (.com)|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524194026/http://askmeaboutmyhair.com/testing-blackness/|archive-date=2015-05-24|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comb test was used to measure the kinkiness of the persons hair. The objective was for the comb to be able to pass through the hair without stopping. The door test was popular at some African American clubs and churches. The people in charge would paint the door a certain shade of brown, similar to the bag test, and if you were darker than the door, you were not allowed admittance into the establishment. These tests were used to measure what level of "blackness" was and was not acceptable for the world. Because the lighter slaves were allowed to work in the house, they were more likely to be educated than the darker slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Keith|first1=Verna M.|last2=Herring|first2=Cedric|date=1991|title=Skin Tone and Stratification in the Black Community|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=97|issue=3|pages=760–764|language=en|jstor=2781783|doi=10.1086/229819}}&lt;/ref&gt; This birthed the stereotype that dark people were stupid and ignorant.

The matrix has four components, the mixed race will help fix racial issues, it serves as a sign of racial progress, it suggest racism as a phenomenon and also suggest that focus on race is racist due to the lack of racial neutrality.&lt;ref name="scholarship.law.berkeley.edu"/&gt;

Analysis of more than 20 million traffic stops in North Carolina showed that blacks were more than twice as likely as whites to be pulled over by police for traffic stops, and that blacks were more likely to be searched following the stop. There were no significant difference in the likelihood that Hispanics would be pulled over, but Hispanics were much more likely to be searched following a traffic stop than whites. When the study controlled for searches in high-crime areas, it still found that police disproportionately targeted black individuals. These racial disparities were particularly pronounced for young men.

The phrase "brown paper bag test," also known as a [[paper bag party]], along with the "ruler test" refers to a ritual once practiced by certain African-American sororities and fraternities who would not let anyone into the group whose skin tone was darker than a paper bag.&lt;ref name="Kerr"&gt;Kerr, A.

A 2013 study used [[spectrophotometer]] readings to quantify skin color of respondents. White women experience discrimination in education, with those having darker skin graduating from college at lower rates than those with lighter skin.

A 2017 paper by Troesken and Walsh found that pre-20th century cities "created and sustained residential segregation through private norms and vigilante activity." However, "when these private arrangements began to break down during the early 1900s" whites started "lobbying municipal governments for segregation ordinances."

===Media===
A 2017 report by Travis L. Dixon (of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) found that major media outlets tended to portray black families as dysfunctional and dependent while white families were portrayed as stable. These portrayals may give the impression that poverty and welfare are primarily black issues. According to Dixon, this can reduce public support for social safety programs and lead to stricter welfare requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/13/news-media-offers-consistently-warped-portrayals-of-black-families-study-finds/|title=News media offers consistently warped portrayals of black families, study finds|last=Jan|first=Tracy|date=2017-12-13|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://colorofchange.org/dangerousdistortion/|title=Report: A Dangerous Distortion of our Families|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 study found that media portrayals of Muslims were substantially more negative than for other religious groups (even when controlling for relevant factors).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Media portrayals of Muslims: a comparative sentiment analysis of American newspapers, 1996–2015|journal=Politics, Groups, and Identities|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/21565503.2018.1531770|year = 2018|last1 = Bleich|first1 = Erik|last2=Van Der Veen|first2=A.

African Americans possessing lighter skin complexion and "European features," such as lighter eyes, and smaller noses and lips have more opportunities in the media industry. For example, film producers hire lighter-skinned African Americans more often, television producers choose lighter skinned cast members, and magazine editors choose African American models that resemble European features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodard | first1 = K | year = 2000 | title = Traumatic Shame: Toni Morrison, Televisual Culture, and the Cultural Politics of the Emotions | url = | journal = Cultural Critique | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 210–240 | doi=10.2307/1354414| jstor = 1354414 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A content analysis conducted by Scott and Neptune (1997) shows that less than one percent of advertisements in major magazines featured African American models. When African Americans did appear in advertisements they were mainly portrayed as athletes, entertainers or unskilled laborers.

Animal print reinforces the stereotypes that African Americans are animalistic in nature, sexually active, less educated, have lower income, and extremely concerned with personal appearances.&lt;ref name=Pious&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pious | first1 = Scott | last2 = Neptune | first2 = Dominique | year = 1997 | title = Racial and Gender Biases in Magazine Advertising: A Content-Analytic Study | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 627–644 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00135.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning African American males in the media, darker skinned men are more likely to be portrayed as violent or more threatening, influencing the public perception of African American men.

Colorism was and still is very much evident in the media. An example of this is shown in the [[minstrel show]]s that were popular during and after slavery. Minstrel shows were a very popular form of theater that involved white and black people in black face portraying black people while doing demeaning things. The actors painted their faces with black paint to and over lined their lips with bright red lipstick to exaggerate and make fun of black people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/jackson/minstrel/minstrel.html|title=The Minstrel Show|website=chnm.gmu.edu|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; When minstrel shows died out and television became popular, black actors were rarely hired and when they were, they had very specific roles. These roles included being servants, slaves, idiots, and criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Punyanunt|first=Narissa|date=|title=The Perceived Realism of African American Portrayals on Television|url=|journal=The Howard Journal of Communications|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; White people wanted to keep this narrative going that black people were forever in debt to them because they essentially rescued blacks from themselves and made them humans instead of savages. This is seen in the "mammy" role that black women often played. The highlights of this role included black women being the loyal servant to the master and taking care of and loving his kids more than her own. Even though black people were allowed to be on TV, they still couldn't be too black. They had to pass the color tests and if they were dark, they were usually playing a humiliating role. That trend is something that follows into present day especially for women.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} There is a huge absence of dark black women in the media and when they are shown, they are typically portraying the angry black woman stereotype but have a light skinned character to balance them out. Darker women are rarely the protagonist that isn't troubled by drugs, or caught up in the legal system.

Some research suggests that white voters' voting behavior is motivated by racial threat. A 2016 study, for instance, found that white Chicago voters' turnout decreased when public housing was reconstructed and 25,000 African Americans displaced. This suggest that white voters' turnout decreased due to not living in proximity to African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enos|first=Ryan D.|date=2016-01-01|title=What the Demolition of Public Housing Teaches Us about the Impact of Racial Threat on Political Behavior |journal=American Journal of Political Science|language=en|volume=60|issue=1|pages=123–142|doi=10.1111/ajps.12156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Voter ID laws in the United States|Voter ID laws]] have brought on accusations of racial discrimination. In a 2014 review by the [[Government Accountability Office]] of the academic literature, three studies out of five found that voter ID laws reduced minority turnout whereas two studies found no significant impact.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-14-634|title=Elections: Issues Related to State Voter Identification Laws [Reissued on February 27, 2015]|website=www.gao.gov|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disparate impact may also be reflected in access to information about voter ID laws. A 2015 experimental study found that election officials queried about voter ID laws are more likely to respond to emails from a non-Latino white name (70.5% response rate) than a Latino name (64.8% response rate), though response accuracy was similar across groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Ariel R.|last2=Nathan|first2=Noah L.|last3=Faller|first3=Julie K.|date=2015-02-01|title=What Do I Need to Vote?

A 2012 study in the city of Boston found that black and Hispanic voters were more likely to be asked for ID during the 2008 election. According to exit polls, 23% of whites, 33% of blacks, and 38% of Hispanics were asked for ID, though this effect is partially attributed to black and Hispanics preferring non-peak voting hours when election officials inspected a greater portion of IDs.

Research by University of Oxford economist Evan Soltas and Stanford political scientist David Broockman suggests that voters act upon racially discriminatory tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soltas|first=Evan|last2=Broockman|first2=David E.|date=2017-02-23|title=Taste-Based Discrimination Against Nonwhite Political Candidates: Evidence from a Natural Experiment|ssrn=2920729}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 study in ''[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]'' found that whites, in particular those who had racial resentment, largely attributed Obama's success among African-Americans to his race, and not his characteristics as a candidate and the political preferences of African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=David C.|last2=Davis|first2=Darren W.|title=The Racial Double Standardattributing Racial Motivations in Voting Behavior|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=82|pages=63–86|language=en|doi=10.1093/poq/nfx050|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 study in the journal ''[[American Politics Research]]'' found that white voters tended to misperceive political candidates from racial minorities as being more ideologically extreme than objective indicators would suggest; this adversely affected the electoral chances for those candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018|title=Too Liberal to Win?

A 2018 study found evidence of racial-motivated reasoning as voters assessed President [[Barack Obama]]'s economic performance. The study found that "Whites attributed more responsibility to Obama under negative economic conditions (i.e., blame) than positive economic conditions (i.e., credit)... Whites attributed equal responsibility to the President and governors for negative economic conditions, but gave more responsibility to governors than Obama for positive conditions. Whites also gave governors more responsibility for state improvements than they gave Obama for national ones."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=David C.|last2=Davis|first2=Darren W.|date=2018|title=Appraisals of President Obama's economic performance: Racial resentment and attributional responsibility|journal=Electoral Studies|volume=55|pages=62–72|doi=10.1016/j.electstud.2018.08.002|issn=0261-3794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study examining "all 24 African American challengers (non-incumbents) from 2000 to 2014 to white challengers from the same party running in the same state for the same office around the same time" found "that white challengers are about three times more likely to win and receive about 13 percentage points more support among white voters.

An analysis by MIT political scientist Regina Bateson found that Americans engage in strategic discrimination against racial minority candidates out of a belief that they are less electable than white male candidates: "In the abstract, Americans consider white men more "electable" than equally qualified black and female candidates. Additionally, concerns about winning the votes of white men can cause voters to rate black and female Democratic candidates as less capable of beating Donald Trump in 2020."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bateson|first=Regina|date=2019-06-30|title=Strategic Discrimination|language=en|location=Rochester, NY|ssrn=3412626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beauty===
{{see also|Sexual racism}}
Studies have shown that due to societal influences, people associate beauty with lighter skin. This is especially evident in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naacpldf.org/brown-at-60-the-doll-test|title=Brown at 60: The Doll Test {{!}} NAACP LDF|website=www.naacpldf.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913054647/http://www.naacpldf.org/brown-at-60-the-doll-test|archive-date=2018-09-13|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief has led dark-skinned children to feel inadequate in who they are and inferior when compared to people with lighter skin. African American women believe they would have better [[luck]] [[dating]] if they were of lighter skin especially when dating African American men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Fultz |first=Lauren A. |title=Psycho-Social Impact of Colorism Among African American Women: Crossing the Divide |year=2014 |type=PsyD |publisher=Wright State University |url=https://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=wsupsych1375225026 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the time that African Americans were forced into slavery, slave owners would use the "paper bag test," it compared their skin color to a paper bag to distinguish whether their complexion was too dark to work inside of the house&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://racism.org/index.php/articles/law-and-justice/citizenship-rights/116-slavery-to-reparations/racial-reentrenchment/1707-colorism001|title='Color Struck': Intragroup and Cross-racial Color Discrimination|last=Ware|first=Leland|website=Race, Racism and the Law|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.Skin color has been a significant aspect of society’s perception of beauty and social status for decades. African Americans' desire for lighter complexions and European features goes back to slavery. Slaves that had a lighter complexion would have the privilege to work indoors while slaves with darker skin were required to work outside in the fields. The complexions of African American Slaves reflected how they got treated and the severity of their punishments if they didn’t comply to their lifestyle that they were forced into.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Margaret|date=2007|title=The Persistent Problem of Colorism: Skin Tone, Status, and Inequality|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-9020.2007.00006.x|journal=Sociology Compass|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=237–254|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9020.2007.00006.x|issn=1751-9020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European beauty standards continue to have an long lasting impact with today's society and not only limited to African American women, children, and men. But also on those from different nations. In an article written by Susan L. Bryant, she mentions a study by Kenneth and Mamie Clark referred to as the "Doll Test" which became more widely known because of the Supreme Court Case: Brown v. Board of Education. In her article, Bryant states that the European beauty standard is "the notion that the more closely associated a person is with European features, the more attractive he or she is considered; these standards deem attributes that are most closely related to whiteness, such as lighter skin, straight hair, a thin nose and lips, and light colored eyes, as beautiful."  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bryant|first=Susan L.|date=2013|title=The Beauty Ideal: The Effects Of European Standards Of Beauty On Black Women|url=https://doi.org/10.7916/D8DF6PQ6|language=en|volume=4|issue=1|pages=80–91|doi=10.7916/D8DF6PQ6}}&lt;/ref&gt;The study was an experiment where 253 black children of ages three to seven where shown two identical dolls, one black and one white in a nursery and public school located in Arkansas and Massachusetts. Two-thirds of the children had indicated that they liked the white dolls better in spite of those children being black.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Clark Doll experiments|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZryE2bqwdk|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, the experiment had been repeated and still results in a clear preference to the lighter skin doll and an internalization of self-hate among black children because of unaddressed European beauty standards. It also found that a child's environment and family life can serve as the biggest influence on their ideals of what is acceptable or unacceptable as to what they define in terms of beauty. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Townsend|first=Tiffany G.|last2=Neilands|first2=Torsten B.|last3=Thomas|first3=Anita Jones|last4=Jackson|first4=Tiffany R.|date=2010-08-02|title=I'm No Jezebel; I am Young, Gifted, and Black: Identity, Sexuality, and Black Girls|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-6402.2010.01574.x|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume=34|issue=3|pages=273–285|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2010.01574.x|issn=0361-6843}}&lt;/ref&gt;
