There seems to be an implicit calculus behind this belief that makes the goodness of the individual inversely related to the darkness of his/her skin.

The '''brown paper bag test''' was a ritual once practiced by certain [[African-American]] [[sorority|sororities]] and [[fraternity|fraternities]] who discriminated against people who were "too black". That is, these groups would not let anyone into the sorority or fraternity whose skin tone was darker than a paper bag. [[Spike Lee]]'s film ''[[School Daze]]'' satirizes this practice.
