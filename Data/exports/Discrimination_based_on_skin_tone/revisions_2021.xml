'''Discrimination based on skin color''', also known as '''colorism''', or '''shadeism''', is a form of [[prejudice]] and/or [[discrimination]] in which people who share similar [[ethnicity]] traits or perceived [[Race (human categorization)|race]] are treated differently based on the social implications that come with the cultural meanings that are attached to [[Human skin color|skin color]].&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = Trina | year = 2001 | title = Shades of Brown: The Law of Skin Color | url = http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&amp;context=dlj| journal = Duke Law Journal | volume = 49 | issue = 1487 | doi = 10.2139/ssrn.233850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found extensive evidence of discrimination based on skin color in [[criminal justice]], [[business]], the [[Economic discrimination|economy]], [[housing]], [[health care]], [[Mass media|media]], and [[politics]] in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. While colorism as a term includes all skin tones, most examples of colorist behavior are directed towards those with darker skin than the offender. Those with darker skin tones subjected to face more discrimination in a multitude of countries around the globe. Due to the desire to experience less prejudice and racial terrorism, some individuals bleach their skin. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) warns that the intentional inclusion of  [[mercury salts]] (which inhibit the production of [[melanin]]) and the chemical [[hydroquinone]], along with and frequent manufacturer and supplier evasion of regulations surrounding these harmful ingredients, poses an acute public health risk.&lt;ref name="WHO2019"&gt;{{cite report|year=2019|title=Preventing Disease Through Healthy Environments: Mercury in Skin Lightening Products|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health|id=WHO/CED/PHE/EPE/19.13|url=https://www.who.int/publications-detail-redirect/WHO-CED-PHE-EPE-19.13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200613223122/https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1262414/retrieve|archive-date=2020-06-13|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BackhausOkunmwendia"&gt;{{cite web|surname=Backhaus|given=Anne|surname2=Okunmwendia|given2=Ella|title=Skin Bleaching in Ghana: "When You Are Light-Skinned, You Earn More"|department=Global Societies|website=[[Spiegel International]]|publisher=[[Der Spiegel (news website)|Der Spiegel]]|date=2020-06-16|url=https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/skin-bleaching-in-ghana-when-you-are-light-skinned-you-earn-more-a-3a46c628-23b2-4d05-9d32-6cb6deeb4a5a-amp|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201001234949/https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/skin-bleaching-in-ghana-when-you-are-light-skinned-you-earn-more-a-3a46c628-23b2-4d05-9d32-6cb6deeb4a5a-amp|archive-date=2020-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clobetasol propionate]] is another ingredient of concern.&lt;ref name="GbetohAmyot"&gt;{{cite journal|surname=Gbetoh|given=Mètogbé Honoré|author-link=scholar:Mètogbé Honoré Gbetoh|surname2=Amyot|given2=Marc|author-link2=scholar:Marc Amyot|title=Mercury, hydroquinone and clobetasol propionate in skin lightening products in West Africa and Canada|date=October 2016|journal=[[Environmental Research]]|volume=150|pages=403–410|issn=0013-9351|doi=10.1016/j.envres.2016.06.030|pmid=27372064|bibcode=2016ER....150..403G|hdl=1866/19006|oclc=1137329629|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of [[skin whitening]] in East Asia dates far back to ancient times. In the ancient dynastic eras, to be light in an environment in which the sun was harsh implied wealth and nobility because those individuals were able to remain indoors while servants had to labor outside.&lt;ref name="Skin Deep: Dying to be White"/&gt; Ancient Asian cultures also associated light skin with feminine beauty. "Jade" white skin in Korea is known to have been the ideal as far back as the [[Gojoseon|Gojoseon era]].&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; Japan's [[Edo period]] saw the start of a trend of women whitening their faces with rice powder as a "moral duty".&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; Chinese women valued a "milk white" complexion and swallowed powdered pearls towards that end.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; Four out of ten women surveyed in [[Hong Kong]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], and South Korea use a skin whitening cream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2009-03-30/skin-whitening-big-business-asia|title=Skin whitening big business in Asia|date=30 March 2009|publisher=Public Radio International|access-date=18 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190618001509/https://www.pri.org/stories/2009-03-30/skin-whitening-big-business-asia|archive-date=18 June 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many Asian cultures, colorism is taught to children in the form of fairy tales - Asian mythological protagonists are typically fair and depict virtue, purity, and goodness. A light complexion is equated with feminine beauty, racial superiority, and power, and continues to have strong influences on marital prospects, employment, status, and income.&lt;ref name="Verma2011"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Verma, Harsh| title=Skin 'fairness'-Culturally Embedded Meaning and Branding Implications| journal=Global Business Review| volume=12| issue=2| year=2011| pages=193–211| doi=10.1177/097215091101200202| s2cid=145725139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalized East Asia still retains these biases, but they are compounded by the influence of Westernized beauty ideals and media that equate whiteness with modern and urban wealth and success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Framing the Bride: Globalizing Beauty and Romance in Taiwan's Bridal Industry|last=Adrian|first=Bonnie|publisher=University of California Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-520-23833-6|pages=147–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== China and Japan ====
Hiroshi Wagatsuma writes in [[Daedalus (journal)|''Daedalus'']] that Japanese culture has long associated [[Human skin color|skin color]] with other physical characteristics that signify degrees of spiritual refinement or of primitiveness.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;
{{Cite journal|last=Wagatsuma|first=Hiroshi|year=1967|title=The Social Perception of Skin Color in Japan|journal=Daedalus|volume=96|issue=2|pages=407–443}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholar repeats an old Japanese proverb: "white skin makes up for seven defects."&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt; More specifically for a woman, very light skin allows people to overlook her lack of other desired physical characteristics.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt; Skin color has and continues to influence attractiveness and socioeconomic status and capability.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;

People in the western hemisphere have long characterised east Asians, specifically Chinese and Japanese people, as "yellow", but the Chinese and Japanese seldom describe their skin color in that way.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt; The Japanese traditionally used the word ''shiroi'' – meaning "white" – to describe the lighter shades of skin in their society.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;

The court ladies of Japan during the [[Nara period]] from 710 to 793 AD applied a large amount of white powder to the face and added red rosy cheeks.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt; Many references to plump women with [[White Skin|white skin]] appear in both drawings and writings from 794 to 1186 AD.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt; In literature, note for example ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' (written {{circa}} 1000–1012) by [[Murasaki Shikibu|Lady Murasaki]].&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;

==== Malaysia ====
A survey concluded that three quarters of Malaysian men thought their partners would be more attractive if they had lighter skin complexions.&lt;ref name="Skin Deep: Dying to be White"/&gt;

In certain Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, a common beauty ideal is the "[[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian look]]" known locally in Malaysia as the "pan-Asian look" is an ideal that stems from the beauty ideal of fair skin, which Eurasians tend to naturally possess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miss Universe Malaysia pageant contestants 'look too western'|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1053286/miss-universe-malaysia-pageant-contestants-look-too-western}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overuse of pan-Asian faces on billboards and on television screens has been a controversial issue in the country. The issue was highlighted in 2009 when [[Zainuddin Maidin]], a Malaysian politician, called for the reduction of pan-Asian faces which he claimed dominate TV and billboards and instead increase the number of Malay, Chinese and Indian faces on local television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaysian ads move triggers industry row|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2007-02/09/content_805345.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the controversy surrounding the preference for Malaysians who are of mixed Asian (Malay, Chinese or Indian) and European descent who possess features such as fair skin, some experts in the industry have said the use of pan-Asian faces can be used to promote the racial diversity of Malaysians. They can also be used to promote a product towards a diverse racial demographic because of their mixed appearance, which the Minister of Information had suggested in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kemper|first=Steven|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqIzh1StFiwC&amp;pg=PA153|title=Buying and Believing: Sri Lankan Advertising and Consumers in a Transnational World|date=1 May 2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226430409|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
The implications of colorism in India have been apparent since the nation's conception. The legacies of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]], Northern and European colonial rule on the [[Indian subcontinent]] have influenced the modern relations between light skin and power dynamics.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; Multiple studies have concluded that preferences for lighter skin in India were historically linked to both the [[Caste system in India|Indian caste system]] and the rule of [[Persia]]n, Mughal and [[Colonial India|European powers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shankar|first=Ravi|date=2007|title=Fair Skin in South Asia: an obsession?|url=http://jpad.com.pk/index.php/jpad/article/viewFile/695/668|journal=Journal of Pakistan Association of Dermatologists|volume=17|pages=100–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mishra|first=Neha|title=India and Colorism: The Finer Nuances|url=https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1553&amp;context=law_globalstudies|journal=Washington University Global Studies Law Review|volume=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism's influence also must be considered. The Hindu social hierarchy emphasized that those belonging to higher castes typically bore lighter skin tones than those in lower castes. Therefore, they are aligned advantageously in society. Colorism in India was also fueled by the attitudes of Europeans towards Indians, who favored the lighter-skinned [[Northern India|Northern Indians]] compared to the darker-skinned people of the [[Deccan]] for administrative positions and other prominent social positions; in turn, power was conceptually intertwined with lighter skin color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thappa|title=Skin color matters in India|url=https://www.pigmentinternational.com/article.asp?issn=2349-5847;year=2014;volume=1;issue=1;spage=2;epage=4;aulast=Thappa|access-date=2021-10-15|journal=Pigment International|year=2014|volume=1|page=2|doi=10.4103/2349-5847.135419|s2cid=178991050}}&lt;/ref&gt; It turns out further that, even in [[South India]], rich people often tend to be light-skinned. This was often influenced by the [[Indo-Aryan migrations#"Aryan invasion"|"Aryan invasion"]] theory, which was a theory which postulated that Northern Indians were actual [[Aryan race|Aryans]] who had migrated to the subcontinent and conquered it thousands of years ago. These Aryans attempted to establish a social hierarchy in order to preserve the differences they held between themselves and the original Indians who inhabited the subcontinent. Additionally, individuals were evaluated based on the occupations they held in society, and being born into a lineage of, say, farmers, would typically render an individual unable to leave said lineage. Job migration across varying occupations was uncommon, and despite the caste system's legality being altered in 1948, the practice is often still found implemented in many regions of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Indervir|date=2012|title=Social Norms and Occupational Choice: The Case of Caste Systems in India|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313397025_SOCIAL_NORMS_AND_OCCUPATIONAL_CHOICE_THE_CASE_OF_CASTE_SYSTEM_IN_INDIA|journal=Indian Journal of Economics and Business|volume=11|issue=2|pages=431-454}}&lt;/ref&gt; As these factors generated the caste system, it grew to encompass economic standing in addition to societal positioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jayawardene|first=Sureshi|date=December 2016|title=Racialized Casteism: Exposing the Relationship Between Race, Caste, and Colorism Through the Experiences of Africana People in India and Sri Lanka|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44508183|journal=Journal of African-American Studies|volume=20|issue=3/4|pages=323–345|doi=10.1007/s12111-016-9333-5|jstor=44508183|s2cid=152002116}}&lt;/ref&gt; European officials were also influenced by existing prejudices, as many Northern Indians looked down upon Southern Indians and held them with disdain.&lt;ref&gt;Savita Malik, The Domination of Fair Skin: Skin Whitening, Indian Women and Public Health, San Francisco State University Department of Health Education (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; 

This sentiment continues to remain. A majority of South Indians hail from the Dravidian ethnolinguistic group, who typically display darker skin tones than [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryans]]. There are societal implications to colorism, many of which severely debilitate the socioeconomic mobility of darker-skinned individuals in India. These can play out in gender stereotyping and regional discrimination. Studies of the Melanin Index (MI) in individuals across regions show that there are variations in skin color, which contribute to the level of discriminations darker-skinned individuals face in these respective regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Iliescu|first1=Florin Mircea|last2=Chaplin|first2=George|last3=Rai|first3=Niraj|last4=Jacobs|first4=Guy S.|last5=Mallick|first5=Chandana Basu|last6=Mishra|first6=Anshuman|last7=Thangaraj|first7=Kumarasamy|last8=Jablonski|first8=Nina G.|date=2018|title=The influences of genes, the environment, and social factors on the evolution of skin color diversity in India|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajhb.23170|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|language=en|volume=30|issue=5|pages=e23170|doi=10.1002/ajhb.23170|pmid=30099804|hdl=20.500.11820/435c03a5-a3ca-4046-aa50-c81c38d08645|s2cid=51966049|issn=1520-6300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jensen|first=Kari B.|date=2020|title=Colorism in Bangladeshi Society|url=https://doi.org/10.21690/foge/2020.63.2f|journal=FOCUS on Geography|volume=63|doi=10.21690/foge/2020.63.2f}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in North India, dark-skinned individuals are often viewed as "dirty" and of a lower status than their lighter-skinned counterparts; this is not exclusive to North India, but is especially prevalent regionally. In the state of [[Maharashtra]], a group of young tribal{{When defined as|date=September 2019}} girls trained to be flight crew through a government scholarship program that aimed to empower women; however, the program seems to have actually disempowered darker-skinned women.

This typically affects Indian women more than men; this notion is backed by gender rights in India, which are not particularly progressive and often limit individuals based on gender in both professional settings and social lives. This is an example of two cleavages which fuel one another (see [[Intersectionality]]) within the nation's borders. Men with darker skin tones are often able to, in a societally-accepted manner, marry women of lighter skin tones.

==== Pakistan ====
Pakistan is largely known for their attention and susceptibility to colorism. It is considered extremely normal to use skin whitening creams as they are very popular among the people of Pakistan, especially the women.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} The media is a big influence on how they view themselves and have come about favoring lighter skin over darker.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Between being exposed to constant ads for skin whitening creams (such as [[Fair &amp; Lovely (cosmetics)|Fair and Lovely]]), to seeing [[Bollywood]] actors with light skin portrayed as good role models and dark skinned actors as poor models, many people from Pakistan have been heavily affected into achieving a fair complexion, which includes staying out of the sunlight as much as possible.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}The popular YouTube web series, Conversations with Kanwal, produced by [[Kanwal Ahmed]], covered colorism and its effect on women and their marital prospects in season 1, episode 7.

Fair skin is a beauty ideal in contemporary Sri Lankan society but has its roots in ancient Sri Lankan beauty ideals. Fairness products and other products that include whitening agents are commonly sold in Sri Lanka and are popular among females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Fair-skin-obsession-An-inferiority-complex-that-needs-treatment-123403.html|title=Fair skin obsession: An inferiority complex that needs treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fair skinned actors and actresses feature prominently in Bollywood films and [[Korean drama]]s both of which are widely popular and influential in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.hrpub.org/journals/article_info.php?aid=1850|title=How the Korean Soap Opera Influence Sri lankan's Life|first=Shyama|last=Jinasena|date=1 September 2014|journal=International Journal of Human Movement and Sports Sciences|volume=2|issue=5|pages=85–90|doi=10.13189/saj.2014.020502}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://djedpress.com/2018/07/31/unfairandlovely-in-sri-lanka/|title=When Fair isn't fair and Lovely isn't lovely in Sri Lanka - Djed|date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Africa ==
In some parts of [[Africa]], women with lighter skin are thought to be more beautiful and likely to find more success than women with darker skin tones.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-20444798 | title=Africa: Where black is not really beautiful| work=BBC News| date=January 2013| last1=Fihlani| first1=Pumza}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often this barrier leads to women turning to [[skin lightening]] treatments, many of which are harmful to the body.&lt;ref name="BackhausOkunmwendia"/&gt;

Historically, the cause of skin lightening dates back to European colonialism, where individuals with lighter skin received greater privilege than those of darker tones.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.4081/jphia.2016.552| pmid=28299156| pmc=5345401|title = Fifty shades of African lightness: A bio-psychosocial review of the global phenomenon of skin lightening practices| journal=Journal of Public Health in Africa| volume=7| issue=2| page=552|year = 2016|last1 = Jacobs|first1 = Meagan| last2=Levine| first2=Susan| last3=Abney| first3=Kate| last4=Davids| first4=Lester}}&lt;/ref&gt; This built a racial hierarchy and color ranking within colonized African nations, leaving psychological effects on many of the darker skinned individuals.&lt;ref name=":21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BackhausOkunmwendia"/&gt;

Colorism affects both women and men in African countries, but it has taken hold of the beauty standards associated with a woman's ability to find success and marriage. The number of women across African countries using bleaching products have gone up with 77% of [[Nigeria]]n women, 52% of [[Senegal]]ese women, and 25% of [[Mali]]an women using lightening products.&lt;ref name=":20"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":21"/&gt; ''[[Der Spiegel (news website)|Der Spiegel]]'' reports that in Ghana, "When You Are Light-Skinned, You Earn More" and that, "Some pregnant women take tablets in the hopes that it will lead their child to be born with fair skin. Some apply bleaching lotion... to their babies, in the hopes that it will improve their child's chances."&lt;ref name="BackhausOkunmwendia"/&gt;

A 2016 study found that [[Chile]]an schoolteachers had lower expectations of their dark-skinned students (''morenos'') than their light-skinned students (''blancos'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ceppe.uc.cl/index.php/ceppe-en-la-prensa/591-estudio-revela-que-alumnos-de-piel-morena-son-considerados-como-menos-competentes-en-los-colegios-chilenos|title=Estudio revela que alumnos de piel morena son considerados como 'menos competentes' en los colegios chilenos|website=Centro de Estudios de Políticas y Prácticas en Educación CEPPE de la U. Católica y Ediciones UC|language=es|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even differences between being dark and being tanned carry different types of statuses, whereas being tanned means more money as they have time to go to the beach or buy tanning products, while the history of colonization automatically attributes darker skin as being lower class. Current studies have been finding that many Chileans favor to be lighter in pigmentation and even perceive themselves to be White despite a mixture of skin tones.

=== Mexico ===
A 2017 study revealed a 45% gap in educational achievement between the darkest- and lightest-skinned [[White Mexicans]] and that wealth in the country similarly correlated to skin color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/study-reveals-racial-inequality-in-mexico-disproving-its-race-blind-rhetoric-87661|title=Study reveals racial inequality in Mexico, disproving its 'race-blind' rhetoric|website=The Conversation|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
===History===
[[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] created a system of [[white supremacy|racial hierarchy]] and a race-based [[ideology]], which led to a structure of oppression that privileged whites over blacks. Biological differences in skin color were used to justify the [[Slavery in the United States|enslavement]] and [[oppression]] of [[African Americans|Africans]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], leading to the development of a social hierarchy that placed whites at the top and blacks at the bottom. Slaves with a lighter complexion, usually resulting from whites raping blacks, were allowed to engage in less strenuous tasks, like domestic duties, while darker-skinned slaves participated in hard labor, which was more than likely done outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hill | first1 = Mark E | year = 2002 | title = Skin Color and the Perception of Attractiveness Among African Americans: Does Gender Make a Difference? | journal = Social Psychology Quarterly | volume = 65 | issue = 1| pages = 77–91 | doi=10.2307/3090169| jstor = 3090169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African-Americans with a partial white heritage were seen to be smarter and superior to dark-skinned blacks, and as a result, they were given broader opportunities for education and the acquisition of land and property.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, K., Wilson, M., &amp; Hall, R. (1993). The color complex: The politics of skin color among African Americans. New York: Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Colorism was a device used in order to create a division between the Africans and further the idea that being as close to white as possible was the ideal image. One of the first forms of colorism was the white slave owners deciding that only the light-skinned slaves would work in the house while the darker ones were subjected to the harsh conditions of the fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fultz|first=Lauren|date=Summer 2017|title=THE PSYCHO-SOCIAL IMPACT OF COLORISM AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN: CROSSING THE DIVIDE|url=http://corescholar.libraries.wright.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1909&amp;context=etd_all|journal=Psychology Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a clear division between the slaves, undermining solidarity against the slave owners.

A variety of specific cutoff tests for skin color emerged, the most famous of being the [[Brown Paper Bag Test|brown paper bag test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ferris.edu/HTMLS/news/jimcrow/question/2014/february.htm|title=Brown Paper Bag Test - 2014 - Question of the Month - Jim Crow Museum - Ferris State University|website=ferris.edu|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; If people's skins were darker than a brown paper bag, they were deemed "too dark".  While the origin of this test is unclear, it is best attested in 20th-century Black culture.

In addition to the bag test, the comb test and the door test were also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://askmeaboutmyhair.com/testing-blackness/|title=Testing Blackness - Ask Me About My Hair (.com)|date=2014-02-10|work=Ask Me About My Hair (.com)|access-date=2017-11-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524194026/http://askmeaboutmyhair.com/testing-blackness/|archive-date=2015-05-24|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The comb test was used to measure the kinkiness of a person's hair. The objective was for the comb to be able to pass through the hair without stopping. The door test was popular in some African American clubs and churches. The people who were in charge of those clubs and churches would paint their doors a certain shade of brown, similar to the bag test, and if people were darker than the doors, they were not admitted into the establishments. These tests were used to measure what level of "blackness" was and was not acceptable in the world. Because the lighter-skinned slaves were allowed to work in the house, they were more likely to be educated than the darker slaves were.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Keith|first1=Verna M.|last2=Herring|first2=Cedric|date=1991|title=Skin Tone and Stratification in the Black Community|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=97|issue=3|pages=760–764|jstor=2781783|doi=10.1086/229819|s2cid=145588099}}&lt;/ref&gt; This birthed the stereotype that dark people were stupid and ignorant. Scholars predict that in the future, the preferred color of beauty will not be black or white, but mixed.&lt;ref name="scholarship.law.berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harris|first1=Angela|title=From Color Line to Color Chart: Racism and Colorism in the New Century|date=January 2008|volume=10|issue=1|page=53|url=https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.bing.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1085&amp;context=bjalp|access-date=March 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars also predict that the United States will adopt a "multicultural matrix" which will help bridge the racial gap in efforts to achieve racial harmony, termed by some a coming "[[Browning of America]]". The matrix has four components, the mixed race will help fix racial issues, it serves as a sign of racial progress, it suggests that racism is a phenomenon and it also suggests that the focus on race is racist due to the lack of racial neutrality.&lt;ref name="scholarship.law.berkeley.edu"/&gt; At the same time, some Americans view this "browning" as a racist conspiracy theory of [[great replacement|demographic replacement]], which has led to anxiety among the American white people believing that their identity and culture are under attack and will be displaced without changes to the US immigration system. [[Eric Kaufmann|Eric Peter Kaufmann]] explored these views among American whites and internationally in the 2018 book ''Whiteshift: Populism, Immigration and the Future of White Majorities''.

A parallel but opposite critique of this theory is made by black scholars, who state that the problem is not racial neutrality but the negative way some races are unfairly perceived. As such, racial "browning" would just be another way to erase dark skin without correcting the bad way it is perceived. From this point of view, racial harmonization is not a valid response to racism at all. In his 2008 book ''The Browning of America and the Evasion of Social Justice'', Ronald R. Sundstrom writes,&lt;ref name="Sundstrom"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sundstrom|first1=Ronald Robles|year=2008|chapter=Introduction|editor1-last=Bernasconi|editor1-first=Robert|editor1-link=Robert Bernasconi|editor2-last=Sharpley-Whiting|editor2-first=Tracy Denean|editor2-link=Tracy Denean Sharpley-Whiting|title=The Browning of America and the Evasion of Social Justice|url=https://repository.usfca.edu/read_books/55/|series=Philosophy and Race|publisher=State University of New York Press|page=2|isbn=9780791475850|oclc=187300169}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|...African American intellectual elites and public figures, as well as other liberals and progressives &lt;nowiki&gt;[perceive]&lt;/nowiki&gt; the browning of America to be a threat to long-existing, or even traditional, claims of [[social justice]] by Native Americans and especially African Americans. Moreover, not only are their claims somehow threatened, but the very meaning of the legal principles, such as "[[civil rights]]," upon which their claims are based, is also experiencing transformation. For those who harbor such fears, the browning of America brings with it yet another opportunity for the nation to evade social justice.}}

A 2019 study, which made use of a dataset of the racial makeup of every U.S. sheriff over a 25-year period, found that "ratio of Black-to-White arrests is significantly higher under White sheriffs" and that the effects appear to be "driven by arrests for less-serious offenses and by targeting Black crime types."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bulman|first=George|s2cid=3616622|title=Law Enforcement Leaders and the Racial Composition of Arrests|journal=Economic Inquiry|issue=4|pages=1842–1858|doi=10.1111/ecin.12800|issn=1465-7295|year=2019|volume=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of more than 20 million traffic stops in North Carolina showed that blacks were more than twice as likely as whites to be pulled over by police for traffic stops, and that blacks were more likely to be searched following the stop. There were no significant difference in the likelihood that Hispanics would be pulled over, but Hispanics were much more likely to be searched following a traffic stop than whites. When the study controlled for searches in high-crime areas, it still found that police disproportionately targeted black individuals. These racial disparities were particularly pronounced for young men.

====Charging decisions====
A 2018 study in the ''[[Journal of Empirical Legal Studies]]'' found that law enforcement officers in Texas who could charge shoplifters with two types of crimes (one more serious, one less so) due to a vaguely worded statute were more likely to charge blacks and Hispanics with the more serious crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Braun|first1=Michael|last2=Rosenthal|first2=Jeremy|last3=Therrian|first3=Kyle|date=2018|title=Police Discretion and Racial Disparity in Organized Retail Theft Arrests: Evidence from Texas|journal=Journal of Empirical Legal Studies|volume=15|issue=4|pages=916–950|doi=10.1111/jels.12201|s2cid=158361514|issn=1740-1461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study in the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]'' found that [[bail]] judges in Miami and Philadelphia were racially biased against black defendants, as white defendants had higher rates of pretrial misconduct than black defendants.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Arnold|first1=David|last2=Dobbie|first2=Will|last3=Yang|first3=Crystal S.|s2cid=13703268|title=Racial Bias in Bail Decisions|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=133|issue=4|pages=1885–1932|doi=10.1093/qje/qjy012|year=2018|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w23421.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study found that "(i) juries formed from all-white jury pools convict black defendants significantly (16 percentage points) more often than white defendants, and (ii) this gap in conviction rates is entirely eliminated when the jury pool includes at least one black member."&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

A 2018 National Bureau of Economic Research experiment found that law students, economics students and practicing lawyers who watched 3D Virtual Reality videos of court trials (where the researchers altered the race of the defendants) showed a racial bias against minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bielen|first1=Samantha|last2=Marneffe|first2=Wim|last3=Mocan|first3=Naci H|date=2018|title=Racial Bias and In-group Bias in Judicial Decisions: Evidence from Virtual Reality Courtrooms|doi=10.3386/w25355|s2cid=53629979|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w25355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sentencing====
Research has found evidence of in-group bias, where "black (white) juveniles who are randomly assigned to black (white) judges are more likely to get incarcerated (as opposed to being placed on probation), and they receive longer sentences."&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

A 2018 study in the ''American Economic Journal: Applied Economics'' found that judges gave longer sentences, in particular to black defendants, after their favorite team lost a home game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Eren|first1=Ozkan|last2=Mocan|first2=Naci|date=2018|title=Emotional Judges and Unlucky Juveniles|journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|volume=10|issue=3|pages=171–205|doi=10.1257/app.20160390|issn=1945-7782|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study in the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'' found that 9% of the black-white gap in sentencing could not be accounted for.&lt;ref name=":19"/&gt; The elimination of unexplained sentencing disparities would reduce "the level of black men in federal prison by 8,000–11,000 men [out of black male prison population of 95,000] and save $230–$320 million per year in direct costs."&lt;ref name=":19"/&gt; The majority of the unexplained sentencing disparity appears to occur at the point when prosecutors decide to bring charges carrying "mandatory minimum" sentences.&lt;ref name=":19"/&gt; A 2018 paper by Alma Cohen and Crystal Yang of [[Harvard Law School]] found that "that Republican-appointed judges give substantially longer prison sentences to black offenders versus observably similar non-black offenders compared to Democratic-appointed judges within the same district court."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Alma|last2=Yang|first2=Crystal|date=2018|title=Judicial Politics and Sentencing Decisions|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w24615|doi=10.3386/w24615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In criminal sentencing, medium to dark-skinned African Americans are likely to receive sentences 2.6 years longer than those of whites or light-skinned African Americans. When a white victim is involved, those with more "black" features are likely to receive a much more severe punishment.&lt;ref name="Hochschild, Jennifer L 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hochschild | first1 = Jennifer L | year = 2007 | title = The Skin Color Paradox and the American Racial Order | journal = Social Forces | volume = 86 | issue = 2| pages = 643–670 | doi=10.1093/sf/86.2.643| s2cid = 145637304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 report by the ''[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]'' found that Florida judges sentence black defendants to far longer prison sentences than whites with the same background.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://projects.heraldtribune.com/bias/sentencing/|title=Same background. Same crime. Different race. Different sentence.|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the same drug possession crimes, blacks were sentenced to double the time of whites.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt; Blacks were given longer sentences in 60 percent of felony cases, 68 percent of the most serious first-degree crimes, 45 percent of burglary cases and 30 percent of battery cases.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt; For third-degree felonies (the least serious types of felonies in Florida), white judges sentenced blacks to twenty percent more time than whites, whereas black judges gave more balanced sentences.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt;

A 2017 report by the [[United States Sentencing Commission]] (USSC) found, "after controlling for a wide variety of sentencing factors" (such as age, education, citizenship, weapon possession and prior criminal history), that "black male offenders received sentences on average 19.1 percent longer than similarly situated White male offenders."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/16/black-men-sentenced-to-more-time-for-committing-the-exact-same-crime-as-a-white-person-study-finds/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116220952/https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/16/black-men-sentenced-to-more-time-for-committing-the-exact-same-crime-as-a-white-person-study-finds/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-11-16|title=Black men sentenced to more time for committing the exact same crime as a white person, study finds|website=washingtonpost.com|access-date=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ussc.gov/research/research-reports/demographic-differences-sentencing|title=Demographic Differences in Sentencing|date=2017-11-13|work=United States Sentencing Commission|access-date=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study on the application of the death penalty in Connecticut over the period 1973–2007 found "that minority defendants who kill white victims are capitally charged at substantially higher rates than minority defendants who kill minorities... There is also strong and statistically significant evidence that minority defendants who kill whites are more likely to end up with capital sentences than comparable cases with white defendants."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donohue|first=John J.|s2cid=39548863|date=2014-10-28|title=An Empirical Evaluation of the Connecticut Death Penalty System Since 1973: Are There Unlawful Racial, Gender, and Geographic Disparities?|journal=Journal of Empirical Legal Studies|volume=11|issue=4|pages=637–696|doi=10.1111/jels.12052|issn=1740-1453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prison system, parole, and pardons====
A 2016 analysis by the ''New York Times'' "of tens of thousands of disciplinary cases against inmates in 2015, hundreds of pages of internal reports and three years of parole decisions found that racial disparities were embedded in the prison experience in New York."&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/03/nyregion/new-york-state-prisons-inmates-racial-bias.html|title=The Scourge of Racial Bias in New York State's Prisons|last1=Winerip|first1=Michael Schwirtz, Michael|date=2016-12-03|last2=Gebeloff|first2=Robert|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blacks and Latinos were sent more frequently to solitary and held there for longer durations than whites.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; The ''New York Times'' analysis found that the disparities were the greatest for violations where the prison guards had much discretion, such as disobeying orders, but smaller for violations that required physical evidence, such as possessing contraband.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;

According to a 2011 ''[[ProPublica]]'' analysis, "whites are nearly four times as likely as minorities to win a pardon, even when the type of crime and severity of sentence are taken into account."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/shades-of-mercy-presidential-forgiveness-heavily-favors-whites|title=Presidential Pardons Heavily Favor Whites|date=2011-12-03|website=ProPublica|first1=Dafna|last1=Linzer|first2=Jennifer|last2=LaFleur|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) that [[Desegregation|integrated]], equal schools be accessible to all children unbiased to skin color. Currently in the United States, not all state funded schools are equally funded.&amp;nbsp; Schools are funded by the "federal, state, and local governments" while "states play a large and increasing role in education funding."&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.edcentral.org/edcyclopedia/school-finance/|title=School Finance - EdCentral|newspaper=EdCentral|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Property tax]]es support most of the funding that local government provides for education."&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt; Schools located in lower income areas receive a lower level of funding and schools located in higher income areas receiving greater funding for education all based on property taxes.&amp;nbsp; The [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] reports that "many high-poverty schools receive less than their fair share of state and local funding, leaving students in high-poverty schools with fewer resources than schools attended by their wealthier peers."&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/more-40-low-income-schools-dont-get-fair-share-state-and-local-funds-department-|title=More Than 40% of Low-Income Schools Don't Get a Fair Share of State and Local Funds, Department of Education Research Finds {{!}} U.S. Department of Education|website=ed.gov|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Department of Education also reports this fact affects "more than 40% of low-income schools".&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; Children of color are much more likely to suffer from poverty than white children.

A 2016 study in the journal ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]]'' found that blacks and Hispanics were systemically underrepresented in education programs for [[Intellectual giftedness|gifted children]] where teachers and parents referred students to those programs; when a universal screening program based on IQ was used to refer students, the disparity was reduced significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Card|first1=David|last2=Giuliano|first2=Laura|date=2016-11-29|title=Universal screening increases the representation of low-income and minority students in gifted education|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=113|issue=48|pages=13678–13683|doi=10.1073/pnas.1605043113|issn=0027-8424|pmc=5137751|pmid=27856741|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "brown paper bag test", also known as a [[paper bag party]], along with the "ruler test" refers to a ritual once practiced by certain African-American sororities and fraternities who would not let anyone into the group whose skin tone was darker than a paper bag.&lt;ref name="Kerr"&gt;Kerr, A.

A 2013 study used [[spectrophotometer]] readings to quantify skin color of respondents. White women experience discrimination in education, with those having darker skin graduating from college at lower rates than those with lighter skin. This precise and repeatable test of skin color revealed that white women experience skin color discrimination in education at levels consistent with African-Americans.

A 2018 ProPublica analysis found that African Americans and Native Americans were underrepresented in clinical trials for new drugs. Fewer than 5% of patients were African-American, even though they make up 13.4% of the total US population.

Moreover, agents' marketing efforts increase with asking price for white, but not for black, customers; blacks are more likely than whites to see houses in suburban, integrated areas ([[Racial steering|steering]]); and the houses agents show are more likely to deviate from the initial request when the customer is black than when the customer is white.

However, "when these private arrangements began to break down during the early 1900s" whites started "lobbying municipal governments for segregation ordinances".

===Media===
Colorism in movies, print, and music can take place in several forms. It can be the representation of people of color in an ill light, the hiring of actors based on their skin color, the use of colors in costumes with the intention to differentiate good and evil characters, or simply failing to represent people of color at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Colorism In Media – The West Georgian|url=http://thewestgeorgian.com/colorism-in-media/|access-date=2021-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 report by Travis L. Dixon (of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) found that major media outlets tended to portray black families as dysfunctional and dependent while white families were portrayed as stable. These portrayals may give the impression that poverty and welfare are primarily black issues. According to Dixon, this can reduce public support for social safety programs and lead to stricter welfare requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/13/news-media-offers-consistently-warped-portrayals-of-black-families-study-finds/|title=News media offers consistently warped portrayals of black families, study finds|last=Jan|first=Tracy|date=2017-12-13|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-12-14|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://colorofchange.org/dangerousdistortion/|title=Report: A Dangerous Distortion of our Families|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 study found that media portrayals of Muslims were substantially more negative than for other religious groups (even when controlling for relevant factors).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Media portrayals of Muslims: a comparative sentiment analysis of American newspapers, 1996–2015|journal=Politics, Groups, and Identities|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/21565503.2018.1531770|year = 2018|last1 = Bleich|first1 = Erik|last2=Van Der Veen|first2=A.

African Americans possessing lighter skin complexion and "European features", such as lighter eyes, and smaller noses and lips have more opportunities in the media industry. For example, film producers hire lighter-skinned African Americans more often, television producers choose lighter-skinned cast members, and magazine editors choose African American models that resemble European features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodard | first1 = K | year = 2000 | title = Traumatic Shame: Toni Morrison, Televisual Culture, and the Cultural Politics of the Emotions | journal = Cultural Critique | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 210–240 | doi=10.2307/1354414| jstor = 1354414}}&lt;/ref&gt; A content analysis conducted by Scott and Neptune (1997) shows that less than one percent of advertisements in major magazines featured African American models.

Colorism was, and still is, very much evident in the media. An example of this is shown in the [[minstrel show]]s that were popular during and after slavery. Minstrel shows were a very popular form of theater that involved white and black people in black face portraying black people while doing demeaning things. The actors painted their faces with black paint to and over lined their lips with bright red lipstick to exaggerate and make fun of black people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/jackson/minstrel/minstrel.html|title=The Minstrel Show|website=chnm.gmu.edu|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; When minstrel shows died out and television became popular, black actors were rarely hired and when they were, they had very specific roles.

Some research suggests that white voters' voting behavior is motivated by racial threat. A 2016 study, for instance, found that white Chicago voters' turnout decreased when public housing was reconstructed and 25,000 African Americans displaced. This suggest that white voters' turnout decreased due to not living in proximity to African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enos|first=Ryan D.|s2cid=51895998|date=2016-01-01|title=What the Demolition of Public Housing Teaches Us about the Impact of Racial Threat on Political Behavior |journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=60|issue=1|pages=123–142|doi=10.1111/ajps.12156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Voter ID laws in the United States|Voter ID laws]] have brought on accusations of racial discrimination.

A 2015 experimental study found that election officials queried about voter ID laws are more likely to respond to emails from a non-Latino white name (70.5% response rate) than a Latino name (64.8% response rate), though response accuracy was similar across groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=White|first1=Ariel R.|last2=Nathan|first2=Noah L.|last3=Faller|first3=Julie K.|date=2015-02-01|title=What Do I Need to Vote?

A 2012 study in the city of Boston found that black and Hispanic voters were more likely to be asked for ID during the 2008 election. According to exit polls, 23% of whites, 33% of blacks, and 38% of Hispanics were asked for ID, though this effect is partially attributed to black and Hispanics preferring non-peak voting hours when election officials inspected a greater portion of IDs.

A 2019 study found that whites are less supportive of welfare when they are told that blacks are the majority of recipients (as opposed to whites).&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Shifting Stereotypes of Welfare Recipients Can Reverse Racial Biases in Support for Wealth Redistribution|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|volume=10|issue=8|pages=1065–1074|date=2019|doi=10.1177/1948550619829062|last1 = Cooley|first1 = Erin|last2=Brown-Iannuzzi|first2=Jazmin L.|last3=Boudreau|first3=Caroline|s2cid=150926190}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when informed that most welfare recipients eventually gain jobs and leave the welfare program, this racial bias disappears.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

An analysis by MIT political scientist Regina Bateson found that Americans engage in strategic discrimination against racial minority candidates out of a belief that they are less electable than white male candidates: "In the abstract, Americans consider white men more "electable" than equally qualified black and female candidates. Additionally, concerns about winning the votes of white men can cause voters to rate black and female Democratic candidates as less capable of beating Donald Trump in 2020."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bateson|first=Regina|date=2019-06-30|title=Strategic Discrimination|location=Rochester, NY|ssrn=3412626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beauty===
{{see also|Sexual racism|Skin whitening}}

Studies have shown that due to societal influences, many people associate beauty with lighter skin. This is especially evident in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naacpldf.org/brown-at-60-the-doll-test|title=Brown at 60: The Doll Test {{!}} NAACP LDF|website=naacpldf.org|access-date=2017-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913054647/http://www.naacpldf.org/brown-at-60-the-doll-test|archive-date=2018-09-13|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief has led dark-skinned children to feel inadequate in who they are and inferior when compared to people with lighter skin. African American women believe they would have better luck dating if they were of lighter skin, especially when dating African American men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Fultz |first=Lauren A. |title=Psycho-Social Impact of Colorism Among African American Women: Crossing the Divide |year=2014 |type=PsyD |publisher=Wright State University |url=https://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=wsupsych1375225026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time that African Americans were forced into slavery, slave owners would use the "paper bag test", which compared their skin color to a paper bag to distinguish whether their complexion was too dark to work inside of the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://racism.org/index.php/articles/law-and-justice/citizenship-rights/116-slavery-to-reparations/racial-reentrenchment/1707-colorism001|title='Color Struck': Intragroup and Cross-racial Color Discrimination|last=Ware|first=Leland|website=Race, Racism and the Law|access-date=2019-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; African Americans' desire for lighter complexions and European features goes back to slavery. Slaves that had a lighter complexion would have the privilege to work indoors while slaves with darker skin were required to work outside in the fields. The complexions of African American slaves reflected how they got treated and the severity of their punishments if they did not comply to the lifestyle that they were forced into.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Margaret|s2cid=11960841|date=2007|title=The Persistent Problem of Colorism: Skin Tone, Status, and Inequality|journal=Sociology Compass|volume=1|issue=1|pages=237–254|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9020.2007.00006.x|issn=1751-9020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The access to and resources to purchase [[skincare]] products or services impacted the notions of colorism among African American women, since enslaved and impoverished black women were more limited in their grooming, which affected the way they were treated by their masters. For example, more light-skinned black women were marketed as "Negroes fit for domestic service" in their masters' homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lindsey |first1=Treva B |title=Black no more: Skin bleaching and the emergence of new negro womanhood beauty culture |journal=Journal of Pan African Studies 4 |date=2011 |volume=no. 4 |pages=97–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European beauty standards continue to have a long lasting impact within American society — and not only limited to African American women, children, and men, but also on those from different nations. In an article written by Susan L. Bryant, she mentions a study by Kenneth and Mamie Clark referred to as the "Doll Test" which became more widely known because of the Supreme Court Case ''Brown v. Board of Education''. In her article, Bryant states that the European beauty standard is "the notion that the more closely associated a person is with European features, the more attractive he or she is considered; these standards deem attributes that are most closely related to whiteness, such as lighter skin, straight hair, a thin nose and lips, and light colored eyes, as beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bryant|first=Susan L.|date=2013|title=The Beauty Ideal: The Effects Of European Standards Of Beauty On Black Women|volume=4|issue=1|pages=80–91|doi=10.7916/D8DF6PQ6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study was an experiment where 253 black children of ages three to seven were shown two identical dolls, one black and one white, in a nursery and public school located in Arkansas and Massachusetts. Two-thirds of the children indicated that they liked the white dolls better in spite of those children being black.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Clark Doll experiments|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZryE2bqwdk|access-date=2019-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, the experiment has been repeated and still results in a clear preference for the lighter-skin doll and an internalization of self-hate among black children because of unaddressed European beauty standards. It also found that a child's environment and family life can serve as the biggest influence on their ideals of what is acceptable or unacceptable as to what they define in terms of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Townsend|first1=Tiffany G.|last2=Neilands|first2=Torsten B.|last3=Thomas|first3=Anita Jones|last4=Jackson|first4=Tiffany R.|date=2010-08-02|title=I'm No Jezebel; I am Young, Gifted, and Black: Identity, Sexuality, and Black Girls|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume=34|issue=3|pages=273–285|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2010.01574.x|s2cid=145313044|issn=0361-6843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2020 report found that football commentators were more likely to praise white players for their intelligence and leadership qualities, while criticizing black players for lacking those attributes.
