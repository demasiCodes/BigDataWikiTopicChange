{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''Discrimination based on skin color''', or '''colorism''', is a form of [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]] in which human beings are treated differently based on the social meanings attached to skin color.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;Jones, Trina (2001), ''Shades of Brown: The Law of Skin Color''. Duke Law Journal, Issue 49, No. 1487. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=233850 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.233850&lt;/ref&gt;

''Colorism'', a term coined by [[Alice Walker]] in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Alice: "If the Present Looks Like the Past, What Does the Future Look Like?" (1982), in ''[[In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens]]'' 290, 290-91 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; is not a synonym of ''racism''. "Race" depends on multiple factors (including ancestry); therefore, racial categorization does not solely rely on skin color. Skin color is only one mechanism used to assign individuals to a racial category, but race is the set of beliefs and assumptions assigned to that category. Racism is the dependence of social status on the social meaning attached to race; colorism is the dependence of social status on skin color ''alone''. In order for a form of discrimination to be considered colorism, differential treatment must not result from racial categorization, but from the social values associated with skin color.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt;

Colorism can be found specifically in parts of Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft-Hinchey, T. (2001, April 18).

Throughout the numerous pigmentocracies across the world, the lightest-skinned peoples have the highest social status, followed by the brown-skinned, and finally the black-skinned who are at the bottom of the social hierarchy. This form of prejudice often results in reduced opportunities for those who are discriminated against on the basis of skin color.&lt;ref name=Lynn&gt;Lynn, Richard.

==Africa==
Skin bleaching is popular in Senegal and all across West Africa, especially among women.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=6625808&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberia===
In Liberia, descendants of African-American settlers (renamed [[Americo-Liberians]]) in part defined social class and standing by raising people with lighter skin above those with dark skin. The first Americo-Liberian presidents such as [[Joseph Jenkins Roberts]], [[James Spriggs Payne]], and [[Alfred Francis Russell]] had considerable proportions of European ancestry.  Most may have been only one-quarter or one-eighth African American. Other aspects of their rising to power, however, likely related to their chances for having obtained education and work that provided good livings.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

[[Edward James Roye]] was the first representative of dark-skinned African-American settlers in [[Liberia]]. The light-skinned party was the [[Republican Party (Liberia)]] and the dark-skinned party was the [[True Whig Party]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In addition to rivalries among descendants of African Americans, the Americans held themselves above the native Africans in Liberia. Thus, descendants of Americans held and kept power out of proportion to their representation in the population of the entire country, so there was a larger issue than color at work.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===South Africa===
[[Coloured]] people consist of three mixed race populations in South Africa who were given more social privilege than other, unmixed, indigenous African groups. During the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid era]], in order to keep divisions and maintain a [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]-focused society, the government used the term ''Coloured'' to describe one of the four main racial groups identified by law: Blacks, [[White South African|Whites]], Coloureds and [[Indian South Africans|Indians]]. (All four terms were capitalised in apartheid-era law.) Many Griqua began to self-identify as "Coloureds" during the apartheid era. There were certain advantages in becoming classified as "Coloured". For example, Coloureds did not have to carry a ''[[dompas]]'' (an identity document designed to limit the movements of the non-white populace), while the Griqua, who were seen as another indigenous African group, did.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Sudan===
A popular phrase in [[North]]ern [[Sudan]] is ''al-Husnu ahmar'' (beauty is red). Whiteness is the ideal color in most Arab societies. The second ranking is ''asmar'' (light tan), followed by ''dhahabi'' (golden), ''gamhi'' (wheatish), ''khamri'' (the color of wine), ''akhdar'' (light black/green).  ''Akhdhar'' is used as a polite alternative to 'black' in describing the color of a dark-skinned Arab. The early Arabs used the word ''akhdar'' (green) to describe people of known Arab nobility and lineage whose color was black. Last and least is ''azraq'', literally "blue", used interchangeably with ''aswad'' to mean "black" — although in the past it referred to whiteness or light skin.&lt;ref name=colorism_Arabs&gt;{{Cite book|last=Al-Baqr al-Affif Mukhtar|title=The Crisis of Identity in Northern Sudan: The Dilemma of a Black People with a White Culture|publisher=in Fluehr-Lobban and Rhodes, Race and Identity in the Nile Valley|pages= 213–24.|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==
In Asia a preference for lighter skin remains prevalent and [[skin whitening]] cosmetic products are popular.&lt;ref name="Skin Deep: Dying to be White"/&gt; Four out of ten women surveyed in [[Hong Kong]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]] and [[South Korea]] used a skin whitening cream, and more than 60 companies globally compete for Asia's estimated $18 billion market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2009-03-30/skin-whitening-big-business-asia |title=Skin whitening big business in Asia |publisher=Public Radio International |date=30 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skin whitening in Asia has a long history and stems back to Ancient China and Japan. To these cultures to be fair in an environment where the sun is harsh, meant that one was upper class and rich enough to stay indoors and leave the outdoor work to servants.&lt;ref name="Skin Deep: Dying to be White" /&gt; In many Asian cultures colorism is taught to children in the form of fairy tales, just like the Grimm fairy tales with the fair skinned white princess or maiden, Asian mythological protagonists are typically fair and depict virtue, purity, and goodness. Fairness is equated with feminine beauty, racial superiority, and power and has strong influences on marital  prospects, employment, status, and income.&lt;ref name="Verma2011"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Verma, Harsh| title=Skin 'fairness'-Culturally Embedded Meaning and Branding Implications| journal=Global Business Review| volume=12| issue=2| year=2011| pages=193–211| url=http://gbr.sagepub.com/content/12/2/193.abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With globalization the obsession with whiteness has become even more prevalent in Asia’s newfound hypercommercialism and consumer culture. In metropolises such as Hong Kong "get white" messages are inescapable, with fair skinned Asian models covering billboards, magazine covers and counter spaces at the department stores. Some two thirds of men surveyed in Hong Kong said they prefer fairer skinned women and almost half of young Asian adults have admitted to use skin whiteners in attempts to achieve a lighter complexion. There have been issues of mercury poisoning in consumers of certain bleaching products in Asia, with some products reported to contain up to 60,000 times the acceptable dose.&lt;ref name="Skin Deep: Dying to be White" /&gt;

Individuals in South Asia have tended to see whiter skin as more beautiful. This was most visible in [[British India]],{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} where skin color served as a signal of high status for British. Thus, those individuals with fairer skin color enjoyed more privileges and opportunities than those with dark skin. Anglo-Indians with more European features were often more upwardly mobile and were considered{{Who|date=May 2010}} to have a more affluent status. These individuals gained preferences{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} in education and in employment. Darker skinned individuals were socially and economically disadvantaged due to their appearance. (Beyond the South Asian subcontinent,
persons who were dark-skinned, "black" or "colored" faced a disadvantage in most European-held colonies.)
Most Indian actors and actresses have light skin.&lt;ref name="Blackout"/&gt;

There are many advertisements in reference to a skin bleaching product, [[Fair and Lovely]], which is targeted directly towards mostly women have darker skin. These advertisements appear on billboards throughout South Asian cities, on television advertisements, and Internet advertisements as well. The subject of the majority of the advertisements depicts a darker skinned woman needing a solution to her "problem" of not being chosen for marriage or a job. The solution suggests that by using Fair and Lovely, her skin tone can be lightened and she can enjoy the privileges associated with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=India's unfair obsession with lighter skin |first=Monisha |last=Rajesh |newspaper=Guardian |date=14 August 2013 |url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/aug/14/indias-dark-obsession-fair-skin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin America==
[[Brazil]] has the largest population of African descendants (living outside of Africa) in the world.  This large number was a result of the African Slave trade. In [[Brazil]], skin color plays a large role in differences among the races. Individuals with lighter skin and who are racially mixed generally have higher rates of [[social mobility]].&lt;ref name="Hernandez1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hernandez |first=Tanya K.|year=2006 |title=Bringing Clarity to Race Relations in Brazil

Those with dark skin and frizzy hair tend to be among the region's poorest and most disenfranchised. Nevertheless, many Brazilians disregard straightening on afro-textured hair as an attitude of shame of their own ethnic and racial origins, and say that persons of African descent should accept themselves as such rather than trying to be "whiter", i.&amp;nbsp;e., fitting in with the colourist beauty standards of Latin America. If this reflects colourism, or rather, greater politicization with respect to race relations and racism, varies greatly with the person.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==United States==
Within the United States, colorism can be observed among all races.  Although it occurs most notably among African Americans, it also occurs among Latinos, Asian Americans, Indian Americans, Native Americans, and even among European Americans.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt;

===African Americans===

====History====
[[European colonialism]] created a system of [[white supremacy]] and racist [[ideology]], which led to a structure of domination that privileged whiteness over blackness. Biological differences in skin color were used as a justification for the enslavement and oppression of Africans, developing a social hierarchy that placed whites at the top and blacks at the bottom. The desire to rise out of this lower position ultimately caused internalized divisions among African Americans.&lt;ref name=Lake&gt;Lake, O. (2003).  Blue veins and kinky hair: Naming and color consciousness in African America. Westport, CT: Praeger&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Miscegenation]], the mixing of different racial groups  (commonly through the sexual exploitation of black female slaves by white male slave owners) resulted in a large number of mixed race individuals with both African and European ancestry. Terminology was also developed to distinguish various levels of African ancestry. The terms [[mulatto]], [[quadroon]] and [[octoroon]] were used to identify a black person with one-half, one-fourth and one-eighth of African ancestry, respectively.&lt;ref name=Keith&gt;Keith, V. M., &amp; Herring, C. (1991). Skin tone and stratification in the black community. American Journal of Sociology, 97(3), 760-778&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves with lighter complexion were allowed to engage in less strenuous tasks, like domestic duties, while the darker slaves participated in hard labor, which was more than likely outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Mark E. "Skin Color and the Perception of Attractiveness Among African Americans: Does Gender Make a Difference?" Social Psychology Quarterly 65.1 (2002): 77-91&lt;/ref&gt; A partial white heritage also gave light-skinned blacks more economic value and caused them to be viewed as smarter and superior to dark-skinned blacks, allowing more advantages in a white-dominated society, such as broader opportunities for education and the acquisition of land and property.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, K., Wilson, M., &amp; Hall, R. (1993). The color complex: The politics of skin color among African Americans. New York: Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent any confusion in regard to racial classification and to prohibit blacks with white ancestry from gaining the same legal status as full-blooded whites, the rule of hypo-descent, or the "[[one-drop rule]]" was mandated. According to the “one-drop rule," even the smallest amount of African ancestry (or a drop of African blood) legally defined a person as black.&lt;ref name=Omi&gt;Omi, M., &amp; Winant, H. (1986). Racial formation in the United States: From the 1960s to the 1980s. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; After the abolition of slavery in 1865, however, colorism created an internalized structure of hierarchy and division within the black community, as lighter-skinned blacks began to set themselves apart by socializing, marrying and procreating with one another. Around the beginning of the twentieth century, separatist standards, such as the brown paper bag, comb, pencil, and flashlight tests began to be implemented. Also, [[Paper bag party|exclusionary social clubs and societies]] were developed to create color divisions within black America that would shape socially constructed ideas about skin color.&lt;ref name=Kerr&gt;Kerr, A. E. (2006). The paper bag principle: Class, colorism, and rumor in the case of black Washington, DC. Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples of African American colorism====

=====Brown paper bag test=====
The phrase “brown paper bag test” has traditionally been used by African Americans throughout the twentieth and twenty-first century with reference to a ritual once practiced by certain African-American sororities and fraternities who would not let anyone into the group whose skin tone was darker than a paper bag. Also known as a [[paper bag party]], these lighter-skinned social circles reflected an idea of exclusion and exclusiveness.  The notion of the “paper bag” has carried a complex and obscure meaning in black communities for many decades. The reason for the usage of the "paper bag" is because the color of the paper bag is considered to be the "center" marker of blackness that distinguishes “light skin” from “dark skin” on a continuum stretching infinitely from black to white. Also, the brown paper bag is believed to act as a benchmark for certain levels of acceptance and inclusion.&lt;ref name=Kerr /&gt; [[Spike Lee]]'s film ''[[School Daze]]'' satirized this practice at historically black colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;Spike Lee, “School Daze,”  40 Acres &amp; A Mule Filmworks, Columbia Pictures Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with the "paper bag test," guidelines for acceptance among the lighter ranks included the "comb test" and “pencil test,” which tested the coarseness of one's hair, and the "flashlight test," which tested a person's profile to make sure their features measured up or were close enough to those of the Caucasian race.&lt;ref name=Kerr /&gt;

=====The bleaching syndrome=====
A phenomenon known as "The bleaching syndrome," which refers to the process of attempting to lighten one’s skin, has made a significant impact on the commercial industry and the lives of African Americans since the beginning of the 21st century.&lt;ref name=bleaching&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=161243|title=Bleaching Creams: Fade to Beautiful?|publisher=Northwestern University|date=03-10-2010|accessdate=03-08-2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=August 2013|date=August 2013}} The roots of the skin bleaching phenomenon stem from African Americans internalizing dominant cultural ideas, without the possibility of full assimilation into American society.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitz,  H. (1978). Race relations in the urban South. New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  A psychological conflict is thus created, causing African Americans to develop a disdain for dark skin as it counters dominant cultural ideals.  In an attempt to simultaneously reduce this conflict and enable assimilation, many African Americans developed the bleaching syndrome.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;Hall, R. (1995). The bleaching syndrome: African American's response to cultural domination vis-A-vis skin color. Journal of Black Studies, 26, 172-184&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the degree of assimilation correlates with skin color based on dominant cultural standards, light skin is crucial relative to the degree of assimilation in the United States. Coincidentally, lighter skin is thought to be an ideal point of reference for attractiveness and marital partner selection among African Americans. The practice of applying light skin as a point of reference, however, is considered to be culturally self-destructive. Ultimately, the bleaching syndrome is a manifestation of the conflicting circumstances regarding the assimilation of African Americans into dominant cultural values.&lt;ref name=Reuter&gt;Reuter,  E. (1969). The mulatto in the United States. New York: Haskell House&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skin Color Paradox===
The Skin Color Paradox refers to the fact that no matter how differently African Americans are treated based on their skin color, their political and cultural attitudes about "blackness" as a form of identity and their feelings of relatedness and solidarity with other blacks tend to remain consistent. Although light-skinned African Americans receive many socioeconomic advantages over dark-skinned African Americans, who have much more punitive relationships with the criminal justice system and greatly diminished prestige, and although African Americans are aware of this disparity in treatment and status, both light-skinned and dark-skinned African Americans have similar political attitudes towards discrimination and race solidarity.&lt;ref name="Hochschild, Jennifer L 2007"/&gt;

Political scientists would suggest that skin color is a characteristic perhaps as equally important as religion, income, and education, which is why this paradox is so surprising, but studies show that skin color has no real bearing on actual political preference. Affirmative action is another example of the paradox between colorism on the one hand and political preference on the other. Studies show that most African Americans that benefit from Affirmative action come from families that are better educated and more well off, and historically this means that the lighter-skinned portion of the black race is receiving the majority of the aid, making it appear as if the race as a whole is being benefited. Yet beneficiaries of this special treatment tend to hold on to their political identification with "blackness." &lt;ref name="Hochschild, Jennifer L 2007"/&gt;

===Stereotypes===
{{see also|Stereotypes of African Americans}}
The light to dark hierarchy within the African American race is one that has existed since the time of slavery, but its problems and consequences are still very evident and lead to various stereotypes.  Darker skinned blacks are more likely to have negative relationships with the police, less likely to have higher education or income levels, and less likely to hold public office.  Darker skinned people are also considered less intelligent, less desirable in women mostly, and are overall seen as inferior to lighter-skinned people.&lt;ref name="Hochschild, Jennifer L 2007"&gt;Hochschild, Jennifer L. "The Skin Color Paradox and the American Racial Order." Social Forces 86.2 (2007): 643-670.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that when measuring education and family income, there is a positive sloping curve as the skin of families gets lighter. This does not prove that darker skinned people are discriminated against, but it provides insight as to why these statistics are recurring.  Lighter skinned people tend to have higher social standing, more positive social networks, and more opportunities to succeed than those of a darker persuasion. Scientists believe this advantage is due to not only to their ancestors' benefits, but also to skin color. In criminal sentencing, medium to dark-skinned African Americans are likely to receive sentences 2.6 years longer than those of whites or light-skinned African Americans, and when a white victim is involved, those with more "black" features are likely to receive a much more severe punishment, reinforcing the idea that those of lighter complexion are of more "value."&lt;ref name="Hochschild, Jennifer L 2007"/&gt;

The perception of beauty can be influenced by racial stereotypes about skin color; the African American journalist [[Jill Nelson]] wrote that "to be both prettiest and black was impossible"&lt;ref name=tws6nov14/&gt; and elaborated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As a girl and young woman, hair, body, and color were society's trinity in determining female beauty and identity, the cultural and value-laden gang of three that formed the boundaries and determined the extent of women's visibility, influence, and importance. For the most part, they still are. We learn as girls that in ways both subtle and obvious, personal and political, our value as females is largely determined by how we look. As we enter womanhood, the pervasive power of this trinity is demonstrated again and again in how we are treated by the men we meet, the men we work for, the men who wield power, how we treat each other and, most of all, ourselves. For black women, the domination of physical aspects of beauty in women's definition and value render us invisible, partially erased, or obsessed, sometimes for a lifetime, since most of us lack the major talismans of Western beauty. Black women find themselves involved in a lifelong effort to self-define in a culture that provides them no positive reflection.&lt;ref name=tws6nov14&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Asian Americans===

In 2003 researchers at the University of California Santa Barbara conducted a survey of 99 Asian Americans on the issue of colorism in their communities. The ethnicities surveyed included Filipino, Japanese, Cambodian, Korean, and Chinese individuals. The respondents answered a number of questions varying from skin color preference, eye shape, face shape, etc. Certain themes emerged from the survey that indicated that colorism is also a part of the Asian American communities and the consensus was that light-skinned people were more beautiful than dark people. One theme that was consistent was that “beauty is light" and another was to "not be romantically linked with or marry dark people". Many respondents reported that a member in their family had openly discouraged dating a dark-skinned Asian American. Similar to African American communities, Asian American women are more likely to be held to the lighter skin standard than Asian American men. This gender difference is due to the fact that the culture, family, and ideologies are strongly based in patriarchy where a woman submits to the man's "ideal of beauty". The preference for lighter skin in Asian communities dates back to traditional Asian standards of beauty brought over by immigrants, however exposure to images of Western ideal beauty in the media has also reinforced Asian American women's desires form lighter skin.&lt;ref name="Rondilla2007"&gt;{{cite book |authors=Rondilla, Joanne L, and Spickard, Paul |title=Is Lighter Better?: Skin-tone Discrimination Among Asian Americans |publisher=Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers |year=2007 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books/about/Is_Lighter_Better.html?id=t-JLtPfRjnEC&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in African American and Latino communities, various skin bleaching creams and treatments are offered in the Asian communities, promoted by  advertisements featuring light, almost pale, skin toned Asian models.&lt;ref name="Verma2011" /&gt;

===Media and Public Perception===
The media is responsible for influencing beliefs regarding ideas of beauty in the African American community.  Mass media productions often perpetuate discrimination based on skin color. African Americans possessing lighter skin complexion and “European features,” such as lighter eyes, and smaller noses and lips have more opportunities in the media industry.&lt;ref name=Hodge&gt;Hodge, C (2011) Coping with and contesting colorism in contemporary African American communities. California State University&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, film producers hire lighter-skinned African Americans more often, television producers choose lighter skinned cast members, and magazine editors choose African American models that resemble European features.&lt;ref&gt;Woodard, K (2000). Traumatic Shame: Toni Morrison, Televisual Culture, and the Cultural Politics of the Emotions. Cultural Critique. 46(1), 210-240.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the media industry sends the messages that African Americans with Eurocentric features are more likely to be accepted, diminishing the status of darker-skinned African Americans.&lt;ref name=Hodge /&gt;

In regards to the magazine industry, African American women are rarely showcased in the most popular magazines.  Therefore, African American girls have difficultly identifying with the models showcased in these magazines, because they do not represent the type of women that they come into contact with in their own communities. There are also biases towards Caucasians in the advertisements used in these magazines.&lt;ref name=Hodge /&gt;  Recent studies have indicated that the number of racially biased advertisements in magazines have increased over the years.  A content analysis conducted by Scott and Neptune (1997) shows that less than one percent of advertisements in major magazines featured African American models. When African Americans did appear in advertisements they were mainly portrayed as athletes, entertainers or unskilled laborers. In addition, seventy percent of the advertisements that features animal print included African American women. Animal print reinforces the stereotypes that African Americans are animalistic in nature, sexually active, less educated, have lower income, and extremely concerned with personal appearances.&lt;ref name=Pious&gt;Pious,  Scott, and Dominique  Neptune  (1997),  "Racial  and Gender Biases  in Magazine  Advertising:  A Content-Analytic Study," Psychology of Women Quarterly, 21 (4), 627-644.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning African American males in the media, darker skinned men are more likely to be portrayed as violent or more threatening, influencing the public perception of African American men. Since dark-skinned males are more likely to be linked to crime and misconduct, many people develop preconceived notions about the characteristics of black men.&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt;  Through extreme gangster rap music, reality crime shows, and newscasts, crime has been defined by contemporary media and given a black face despite statistics that paint a different picture. For example, cocaine use has been found to be higher among whites, but African Americans are the dominant figures seen on crime shows such as ''[[Cops (1989 TV series)|Cops]]''.&lt;ref name=Rome&gt;Rome, D. (2004). Black demons: The media’s depiction of the African American male stereotype. Westport, CT: Praeger Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The negative public perception of darker-skinned African American places them at a disadvantage in other aspects of society, such as the workforce. Skin color plays a significant role in the acceptance of African Americans in the workforce and can even hold more importance than an individual's credentials and ability. For example, hiring managers generally have a different perception of a light-skinned African American female applicant, compared to a dark-skinned female applicant. Light-skinned African American women were found to have higher salaries than dark-skinned women, and light-skinned women were more satisfied with their jobs in regards to pay and advancement opportunities.&lt;ref name=Hunter&gt;Hunter, Margaret. 2002. “‘If You’re Light You’re Alright’: Light Skin Color as Social Capital for Women of Color.” Gender and Society 16:175–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have also termed dark-skinned women as being in a “triple-jeopardy” situation because all three aspects of their identity—their gender, race and skin-tone—can have negative and harmful implications on occupational opportunities and overall feelings of competency.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Maxine S. and Verna M. Keith. 2001. “The Blacker the Berry: Gender, Skin Tone, Self-Esteem, and Self-Efficacy.” Gender &amp; Society 15(3):336–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite exclusion and bias, the media has made an attempt to correct some of the negative images of African Americans. Examples of shows in which African Americans have been positively portrayed in the past include ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]''{{Dubious|date=August 2012}} and ''[[A Different World (TV series)|A Different World]]''. In addition, new television specials such as ''Black Girl's Rock'' and ''My Black is Beautiful'' highlight African American men and women for their contributions to society. Overall, these media changes have helped to provide a unique and more accurate representation of black culture in the twenty-first century. Television networks such as ''Centric'' and ''TV One'' and magazines such as ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'' and ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' play a major role in portraying African Americans in a more positive light than they have been portrayed in the past.&lt;ref name=Hodge /&gt;

==Globalization==

The issue of colorism has gone global especially with the rise of globalization and advancing technologies. Through globalization multinational media conglomerates export U.S. culture, products, and cultural imperialism, including cultural images of race and color preference.&lt;ref name="Hunter2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hunter, Margaret |title=The Persistent Problem of Colorism: Skin Tone, Status, and Inequality |journal=Sociology Compass volume=1 |issue=1 |year=2007 |pages=237–254 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-9020.2007.00006.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; The global media implications are that Eurocentric physical features which are less aligned with native ancestry are found to be more attractive.&lt;ref name="Harrison2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harrison, Matthew S. |title=Colorism:The Often Undiscussed "ism" in America's Work Force |journal=The Jury Expert |year=2010  |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=67–77 |url=http://www.thejuryexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/HarrisonTJEJan2010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. exports images of the good life, white beauty and affluence which many people in other poorer countries yearn for. The Philippines is a good example of this due to the fact that the country is  an intersection of internalized colonial values and a culture of new global viewing. Just as in other Third World countries, the Philippines contemporary culture valorizes American culture and places high value on white beauty. In Korea, women pay high sums of money for eyelid surgery and skin bleaching products to achieve Westernized white beauty. Plastic surgery and skin bleaching are both derived from the globalization of U.S. dominant views of fair beauty and images of lighter-skinned celebrities are widely valued in the global market place. This is the reason as to why colorism is so difficult to battle, because it is so pervasive with images supporting this system of inequality reaching all over the globe. The advancement of television, film, print ads, and internet featuring lighter skin as a cultural ideal influences Third World and modernizing countries, informing them that to be of lighter skin color is not only a way to live the “good life” but is also culturally imperative.&lt;ref name="Hunter2007" /&gt;

===Skin Bleaching===

Skin bleaching has long since been one of the oldest forms of achieving fair skin and has become a multibillion dollar industry.&lt;ref name="Hunter2007" /&gt; This obsession with whiteness has not faded over time; a survey concluded that three quarters of Malaysian men thought their partners would be more attractive if they had lighter skin complexions.&lt;ref name="Skin Deep: Dying to be White" /&gt; Women in countries such as South Korea, India, China, Saudi Arabia, and Uganda, use toxic skin bleaching creams to achieve a lighter skin complexion. Especially with the increase in globalization, many post colonial and Third World nations have seen a rise in the purchasing of skin lightening creams to achieve a Eurocentric appearance. Skin bleachers, which are marketed as ‘beauty products’ go by many names: skin lighteners, skin whiteners, skin-toning creams, skin fading gels, etc., however, the promises are all the same: that the product will help to reduce melanin in its consumers. In countries throughout Asia, these skin bleachers can be purchased in malls, drug stores, and even on the internet.&lt;ref name="Hunter2007" /&gt; These markets thrive on the vulnerabilities, fears, and taps into the cultural beliefs of countries that believe light-skinned is more valued. In the India, the highest selling brand of skin lightening bleach cream, Fair &amp; Lovely, promotes that the product produces dignity and that to be fair skinned is aspirational.&lt;ref name="Verma2011" /&gt; There are many reasons for the increasing global phenomenon of skin lighteners, from one’s skin being too dark, to attracting romantic prospects, to be popular and fashionable, or to ensure one’s skin is brown and not black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Charles, Christopher A. D. |title=Skin Bleaching and the Prestige Complexion of Sexual Attraction |journal=Sexuality &amp; Culture |volume=15 |issue=4 |year=2011 |pages=375–390 |url=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12119-011-9107-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these skin bleaching products usually contain three harmful ingredients: mercury, hydroquinone, and/or corticosteroids. All of these chemicals can be extremely dangerous and fatal, and most of the products are made outside the U.S. and Europe and are therefore less subject to strict regulation.&lt;ref name="Hunter2007" /&gt;

===Tanning===
In the 20th century there has been a shift towards a preference for darker, tanned skin in white communities. The beginning of this change has been attributed to Frenchwoman [[Coco Chanel]] making tanned skin seem fashionable, luxurious and healthy in Paris in the 1920's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Art Deco of the Palm Beaches|last = Koskoff|first = Sharon|publisher = Arcadia Publishing|year = 2007|location = Chicago|pages = 2|url = http://books.google.com.au/books?id=RHdeo6uvlfYC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=%22Coco+Chanel%22+%22Josephine+Baker%22+tan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tBSLUu7cGMyrlQWbpYHIDg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Coco%20Chanel%22%20%22Josephine%20Baker%22%20tan&amp;f=false}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Tanned skin has become associated with the increased leisure time and sportiness of wealth and social status while pale skin is associated with indoor office work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2001/03/01/249992.htm?site=science/greatmomentsinscience|title = Skin Colour 1|website = ABC Science|publisher = Australian Broadcasting Commission|date = 1 March 2001|last = Kruszelnicki|first = Karl|accessdate = 19 November 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have found tanned skin is regarded as both more attractive and healthier than pale skin,&lt;ref name="pediatrics.aappublications.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Use of Sunscreen, Sunburning Rates, and Tanning Bed Use Among More Than 10 000 US Children and Adolescents|publisher=pediatrics.aappublications.org|date=2002-06-06 (PEDIATRICS Vol. 109 No. 6)|accessdate=2010-09-14|pages=1009–1014|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/109/6/1009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="interscience.wiley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119318887/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 |title=Effects of Suntan on Judgements of Healthiness and Attractiveness by Adolescents – Broadstock – 2006 – Journal of Applied Social Psychology – Wiley Online Library |publisher=.interscience.wiley.com |date=2006-07-31 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="interscience.wiley.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119292742/abstract |title=The Social Psychology of Tanning and Sunscreen Use: Self-Presentational Motives as a Predictor of Health Risk – Leary – 2006 – Journal of Applied Social Psychology – Wiley Online Library |publisher=.interscience.wiley.com |date=2006-07-31 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="physorg.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news78679968.html |title=Tan is 'In': Study Finds Light Brown More Attractive than Pale or Dark Skin |publisher=Physorg.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a direct correlation between the degree of tanning and perceived attractiveness especially in young woman.&lt;ref name="Pp"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Leary |first1=Mark R. |last2=Jones |first2=Jody L. |title=The Social Psychology of Tanning and Sunscreen Use: Self-Presentational Motives as a Predictor of Health Risk |journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |volume=23 |pages=1390–406 |year=1993 |doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1993.tb01039.x |issue=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fact or wishful thinking?
