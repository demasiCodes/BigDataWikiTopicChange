'''Discrimination based on skin color''', or '''colorism''', is a form of [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]] in which people are treated differently based on the social meanings attached to skin color.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = Trina | year = 2001 | title = Shades of Brown: The Law of Skin Color | url = | journal = Duke Law Journal | volume = 49 | issue = 1487 | pages = | doi = 10.2139/ssrn.233850 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Colorism'', a term coined by [[Alice Walker]] in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walker | first1 = Alice | year = 1983 | title = If the Present Looks Like the Past, What Does the Future Look Like?" (1982) | url = | journal = [[In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens]] | volume = 290 | issue = | pages = 290–91 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is not a synonym of ''[[racism]]''. "Race" depends on multiple factors (including ancestry); therefore, racial categorization does not solely rely on skin color. Skin color is only one mechanism used to assign individuals to a racial category, but race is the set of beliefs and assumptions assigned to that category. Racism is the dependence of social status on the social meaning attached to race; colorism is the dependence of social status on skin color ''alone''. In order for a form of discrimination to be considered colorism, differential treatment must not result from racial categorization, but from the social values associated with skin color.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt; A 2015 study, for example, finds that among African Americans, skin color differences are associated with perceptions of discrimination from whites and other African Americans.&lt;ref name="Monk 396–444"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Monk|first=Ellis P.|date=2015-09-01|title=The Cost of Color: Skin Color, Discrimination, and Health among African-Americans|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/682162|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=121|issue=2|pages=396–444|doi=10.1086/682162|issn=0002-9602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century there has been a shift towards a preference for darker, tanned skin in white communities. The beginning of this change has been attributed to Frenchwoman [[Coco Chanel]] making tanned skin seem fashionable, luxurious and healthy in Paris in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Art Deco of the Palm Beaches|last = Koskoff|first = Sharon|publisher = Arcadia Publishing|year = 2007|location = Chicago|pages = 2|URL = https://books.google.com/?id=RHdeo6uvlfYC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=%22Coco+Chanel%22+%22Josephine+Baker%22+tan#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Coco%20Chanel%22%20%22Josephine%20Baker%22%20tan&amp;f=false|isbn = 9780738544151}}

==Africa==

===Liberia===
{{disputed|section|date=July 2015}}
{{POV|section|date=July 2015}}
In Liberia, descendants of African-American settlers (renamed [[Americo-Liberians]]) in part defined social class and standing by raising people with lighter skin above those with dark skin. The first Americo-Liberian presidents such as [[Joseph Jenkins Roberts]], [[James Spriggs Payne]], and [[Alfred Francis Russell]] had considerable proportions of European ancestry.  Most may have been only one-quarter or one-eighth African American. Other aspects of their rising to power, however, likely related to their chances for having obtained education and work that provided good livings.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In addition to rivalries among descendants of African Americans, the Americans held themselves above the native Africans in Liberia. Thus, descendants of Americans held and kept power out of proportion to their representation in the population of the entire country, so there was a larger issue than color at work.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===South Africa===
[[Coloured|Colored]] people consist of three mixed race populations in South Africa who were given more social privilege than other, unmixed, indigenous African groups. During the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid era]], in order to keep divisions and maintain a [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]-focused society, the government used the term ''Coloured'' to describe one of the four main racial groups identified by law: Blacks, [[White South African|Whites]], Coloureds and [[Indian South Africans|Indians]]. (All four terms were capitalised in apartheid-era law.) Many [[Griqua people|Griqua]] began to self-identify as "Coloureds" during the apartheid era. There were certain advantages in becoming classified as "Coloured". For example, Coloureds did not have to carry a ''[[dompas]]'' (an identity document designed to limit the movements of the non-white populace), while the Griqua, who were seen as another indigenous African group, did.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Sudan===
A popular phrase in [[Sudan]] is ''al-Husnu ahmar'' (Arabic: الحسن أحمر)  meaning "beauty is red", although the whiteness is the ideal color in most Arab societies. The following rankings of beauty in descending order are:  ''asmar'' (Arabic: أسمر) meaning light tan, literally "brown",  ''dhahabi'' (Arabic: ذهبي) meaning "golden", ''gamhi'' (Arabic: قمحي) meaning wheatish, ''khamri'' (Arabic: خمري) meaning wine colored, and lastly ''akhdar'' meaning "light black" – literally, "green".  ''Akhdhar'' is the polite alternative descriptive term for "black" meaning a dark-skinned Arab. Lastly, ''azraq'' (Arabic: أزرق) meaning "blue" is used interchangeably with ''aswad'' (Arabic: أسود) meaning "black"; however, in the past ''aswad'' has referred to white, light skin.&lt;ref name=colorism_Arabs&gt;{{Cite book|last=Al-Baqr al-Affif Mukhtar|title=The Crisis of Identity in Northern Sudan: The Dilemma of a Black People with a White Culture|publisher=in Fluehr-Lobban and Rhodes, Race and Identity in the Nile Valley|pages= 213–24.|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==
[[File:Skin_lightening_ad.jpg|thumb|Skin lightening billboard advertisement in Bangladesh]]
In Asia a preference for lighter skin remains prevalent.&lt;ref name="Skin Deep: Dying to be White"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/east/05/13/asia.whitening/|title=Skin Deep: Dying to be White|date=2002-05-15|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2010-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Asian cultures associated light skin with feminine beauty in particular. "Jade" white skin in Korea is known to have been the ideal as far back as the [[Gojoseon|Gojoseon era]]. Japan's [[Edo period]] saw the start of a trend of women whitening their faces with rice powder as a "moral duty". Chinese women valued a "milk white" complexion and swallowed powdered pearls towards that end.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=P.H.|first=Li, Eric|last2=Jeong|first2=Min, Hyun|last3=W.|first3=Belk, Russell|date=2008-01-01|title=Skin Lightening and Beauty in Four Asian Cultures|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/13415/volumes/v35/NA-35|journal=NA - Advances in Consumer Research Volume 35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four out of ten women surveyed in [[Hong Kong]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]] and [[South Korea]] used a skin whitening cream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2009-03-30/skin-whitening-big-business-asia |title=Skin whitening big business in Asia |publisher=Public Radio International |date=30 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of skin whitening in Asia dates far back to ancient China, India and Japan. In the ancient dynastic eras, to be light in an environment in which the sun was harsh meant implied wealth and nobility remaining indoors with servants to labor outside.&lt;ref name="Skin Deep: Dying to be White" /&gt; In many Asian cultures, colorism is taught to children in the form of fairy tales, just as the Grimms' fairy tales featured light-skinned princesses or maidens; Asian mythological protagonists are typically fair and depict virtue, purity, and goodness. A light complexion is equated with feminine beauty, racial superiority, and power, and continues to have strong influences on marital  prospects, employment, status, and income.&lt;ref name="Verma2011"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Verma, Harsh| title=Skin 'fairness'-Culturally Embedded Meaning and Branding Implications| journal=Global Business Review| volume=12| issue=2| year=2011| pages=193–211| url=http://gbr.sagepub.com/content/12/2/193.abstract| doi=10.1177/097215091101200202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalized Asia still retains these biases, but they are compounded by the influence of Westernized beauty ideals and media that equates whiteness with modern and urban wealth and success. The legacies of European colonialism also influence the modern relations between light skin and power.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===India===

Discrimination based on skin color was most visible in British India, where skin color served as a signal of high status for the foreign British who actively promoted the idea.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The caste system in India too involves complications of skin color. In Indian culture, "black" is associated with the underprivileged caste. "Black" symbolizes "dark", "evil" , "dirty", etc in India. On the opposite side, "white" has been a symbol of "purity", "fairness", cleanliness", and "beauty", proving itself to be a symbol of power and [[White privilege|privilege]]. Aspects of Hindu mythology reinforce this idea with the goddess Kali. Kali is a dark-skinned goddess known for destruction and a symbol of ugliness. Kali's appearance and character traits visually demonstrate the negative association Indian culture gives to dark complexioned women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=P.H.|first=Li, Eric|last2=Jeong|first2=Min, Hyun|last3=W.|first3=Belk, Russell|date=2008-01-01|title=Skin Lightening and Beauty in Four Asian Cultures|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/13415/volumes/v35/NA-35|journal=NA - Advances in Consumer Research Volume 35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British historians observed that since the upper castes were not involved in tedious labor and weren't as exposed to the sun as the lower castes, they used to stay indoors and thus possessed lighter brown skin.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} The lower castes on the other hand had higher melanin concentration in their skin cells due to continued exposure to sun from working in agricultural fields and outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;Savita Malik, The Domination of Fair Skin: Skin Whitening, Indian Women and Public Health, San Francisco State University Department of Health Education (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Indians prefer their matrimonial partners to be light-skinned.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} The deep-rooted color bias has ensured that there is extensive discrimination in the labor market, as people with [[light skin]] are generally preferred.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

For example in the state of Maharashta  a group of young tribal girls trained to be flight crew through a government scholarship program that aimed to empower women. The majority of girls were denied employment due to their darker skin-tone. A few of those women landed jobs, but only as out of sight ground crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Impact of Colorism on the Career Aspirations and Career Opportunities of Women in India|journal=Advances In Developing Human Resources|volume=18(I) 38-53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malaysia ===
A survey concluded that three quarters of Malaysian men thought their partners would be more attractive if they had lighter skin complexions.&lt;ref name="Skin Deep: Dying to be White" /&gt;

In certain Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, a common beauty ideal is the "[[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian look]]" known locally in Malaysia as the "pan-Asian look" is an ideal that stems from the beauty ideal of fair skin – which Eurasians tend to naturally possess.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1053286/miss-universe-malaysia-pageant-contestants-look-too-western Miss Universe Malaysia pageant contestants 'look too western']&lt;/ref&gt; The overuse of Pan-Asian faces on billboards and on television screens has been a controversial issue in the country. The issue was highlighted in 2009 when [[Zainuddin Maidin]], a Malaysian politician, called for the reduction of pan-Asian faces which he claimed dominate TV and billboards and instead increase the number of Malay, Chinese and Indian faces on local television.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2007-02/09/content_805345.htm Malaysian ads move triggers industry row]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the controversy surrounding the preference for Malaysians who are of mixed Asian (Malay, Chinese or Indian) and European descent who possess features such as fair skin, some experts in the industry have said the use of pan-Asian faces can be used to promote the racial diversity of Malaysians. They can also be used to promote a product towards a diverse racial demographic because of their mixed appearance which the Minister of Information had suggested in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=QqIzh1StFiwC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=Buying+and+Believing:+Sri+Lankan+Advertising+and+Consumers+in+a+.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e3Eamcy4gt&amp;sig=GPDW-L4JPavmkk9Z2ifZzvrokSc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5usyCh-vNAhXLND4KHd1xBRIQ6AEINDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Pan-Asian&amp;f=false Buying and Believing: Sri Lankan Advertising and Consumers in a Transnational World]&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
[[European colonialism]] created a system of [[white supremacy]] and racist [[ideology]], which led to a structure of domination that privileged whiteness over blackness. Biological differences in skin color were used as a justification for the enslavement and oppression of Africans, developing a social hierarchy that placed whites at the top and blacks at the bottom. Slaves with lighter complexion were allowed to engage in less strenuous tasks, like domestic duties, while the darker slaves participated in hard labor, which was more than likely outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Mark E. "Skin Color and the Perception of Attractiveness Among African Americans: Does Gender Make a Difference?" Social Psychology Quarterly 65.1 (2002): 77-91&lt;/ref&gt; African American with a partial white heritage were seen to be smarter and superior to dark-skinned blacks, giving them broader opportunities for education and the acquisition of land and property.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, K., Wilson, M., &amp; Hall, R.

Being "too black" has recently been acknowledged by the U.S. Federal courts in an employment discrimination case under Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. In ''Etienne v.

The phrase "brown paper bag test", also known as a [[paper bag party]], along with the "ruler test" refers to a ritual once practiced by certain African-American sororities and fraternities who would not let anyone into the group whose skin tone was darker than a paper bag.&lt;ref name="Kerr"&gt;Kerr, A.

Moreover, agents' marketing efforts increase with asking price for white, but not for black, customers; blacks are more likely than whites to see houses in suburban, integrated areas ([[Racial steering|steering]]); and the houses agents show are more likely to deviate from the initial request when the customer is black than when the customer is white. These three findings are consistent with the possibility that agents act upon the belief that some types of transactions are relatively unlikely for black customers (statistical discrimination)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ondrich|first=Jan|last2=Ross|first2=Stephen|last3=Yinger|first3=John|date=2003-11-01|title=Now You See It, Now You Don't: Why Do Real Estate Agents Withhold Available Houses from Black Customers?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/003465303772815772|journal=Review of Economics and Statistics|volume=85|issue=4|pages=854–873|doi=10.1162/003465303772815772|issn=0034-6535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that light-skinned African American women have higher salaries and greater job satisfaction than dark-skinned women.&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hunter | first1 = Margaret | year = 2002 | title = 'If You're Light You're Alright': Light Skin Color as Social Capital for Women of Color | url = | journal = Gender and Society | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 175–93 | doi=10.1177/08912430222104895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Media====
The media is responsible for influencing beliefs regarding ideas of beauty in the African American community. Mass media productions often perpetuate discrimination based on skin color. African Americans possessing lighter skin complexion and "European features", such as lighter eyes, and smaller noses and lips have more opportunities in the media industry. For example, film producers hire lighter-skinned African Americans more often, television producers choose lighter skinned cast members, and magazine editors choose African American models that resemble European features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodard | first1 = K | year = 2000 | title = Traumatic Shame: Toni Morrison, Televisual Culture, and the Cultural Politics of the Emotions | url = | journal = Cultural Critique | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 210–240 | doi=10.2307/1354414}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the media industry sends the messages that African Americans with Eurocentric features are more likely to be accepted, diminishing the status of darker-skinned African Americans.

In regards to the magazine industry, African American women are rarely showcased in the most popular magazines. Therefore, African American girls have difficultly identifying with the models showcased in these magazines, because they do not represent the type of women that they come into contact with in their own communities. Recent studies have indicated that the number of racially biased advertisements in magazines have increased over the years. A content analysis conducted by Scott and Neptune (1997) shows that less than one percent of advertisements in major magazines featured African American models. When African Americans did appear in advertisements they were mainly portrayed as athletes, entertainers or unskilled laborers. In addition, seventy percent of the advertisements that features animal print included African American women. Animal print reinforces the stereotypes that African Americans are animalistic in nature, sexually active, less educated, have lower income, and extremely concerned with personal appearances.&lt;ref name=Pious&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pious | first1 = Scott | last2 = Neptune | first2 = Dominique | year = 1997 | title = Racial and Gender Biases in Magazine Advertising: A Content-Analytic Study | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 627–644 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00135.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning African American males in the media, darker skinned men are more likely to be portrayed as violent or more threatening, influencing the public perception of African American men. Since dark-skinned males are more likely to be linked to crime and misconduct, many people develop preconceived notions about the characteristics of black men.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1995|title=The bleaching syndrome: African American's response to cultural domination vis-A-vis skin color|url=|journal=Journal of Black Studies|volume=26|issue=|pages=172–184|doi=10.1177/002193479502600205|last1=Hall|first1=R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Politics ====
A 2011 study found that white state legislators of both political parties were less likely to respond to constituents with African-American names.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=Daniel M.|last2=Broockman|first2=David E.|date=2011-07-01|title=Do Politicians Racially Discriminate Against Constituents?

Black legislators thus appear substantially more intrinsically motivated to advance blacks' interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Broockman|first=David E.|date=2013-07-01|title=Black Politicians Are More Intrinsically Motivated to Advance Blacks' Interests: A Field Experiment Manipulating Political Incentives|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12018/abstract|journal=American Journal of Political Science|language=en|volume=57|issue=3|pages=521–536|doi=10.1111/ajps.12018|issn=1540-5907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research suggests that white voters' voting behavior is motivated by racial threat. A 2016 study, for instance, found that white Chicago voters' turnout decreased when public housing was reconstructed and 25,000 African Americans displaced. This suggest that white voters' turnout decreased due to not living in proximity to African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enos|first=Ryan D.|date=2016-01-01|title=What the Demolition of Public Housing Teaches Us about the Impact of Racial Threat on Political Behavior|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12156/abstract|journal=American Journal of Political Science|language=en|volume=60|issue=1|pages=123–142|doi=10.1111/ajps.12156|issn=1540-5907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Voter ID laws in the United States|Voter ID laws]] have brought on accusations of racial discrimination. In a 2014 review by the [[Government Accountability Office]] of the academic literature, three studies out of five found that voter ID laws reduced minority turnout whereas two studies found no significant impact.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-14-634|title=Elections: Issues Related to State Voter Identification Laws [Reissued on February 27, 2015]|website=www.gao.gov|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disparate impact may also be reflected in access to information about voter ID laws. A 2015 experimental study found that election officials queried about voter ID laws are more likely to respond to emails from a non-Latino white name (70.5% response rate) than a Latino name (64.8% response rate), though response accuracy was similar across groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Ariel R.|last2=Nathan|first2=Noah L.|last3=Faller|first3=Julie K.|date=2015-02-01|title=What Do I Need to Vote?

A 2012 study in the city of Boston found that black and Hispanic voters were more likely to be asked for ID during the 2008 election. According to exit polls, 23% of whites, 33% of blacks, and 38% of Hispanics were asked for ID, though this effect is partially attributed to black and Hispanics preferring non-peak voting hours when election officials inspected a greater portion of IDs. Precinct differences also confound the data as black and Hispanic voters tended to vote at black and Hispanic-majority precincts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cobb|first=Rachael V.|last2=Greiner|last3=James|first3=D.|last4=Quinn|first4=Kevin M.|date=2010-06-14|title=Can Voter ID Laws Be Administered in a Race-Neutral Manner?
