{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''Colorism''' refers to a form of [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]] in which human beings are treated differently based on the social meanings attached to skin color.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;Jones, Trina, Shades of Brown: The Law of Skin Color. Duke Law Journal, Issue 49, No. 1487. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=233850 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.233850&lt;/ref&gt;  

Coined by Alice Walker in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Alice, If the Present Looks Like the Past, What Does the Future Look Like? (1982),  in IN  SEARCH OF  OUR  MOTHER’S  GARDENS 290, 290-91 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; colorism, although often overshadowed by racism, is not the same as racism.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt;  Multiple factors are used to indicate race (e.g. skin color or ancestry); therefore, racial categorization does not solely rely on skin color.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt;  Skin color is only one mechanism used to assign individuals to a racial category, but race is the set of beliefs and assumptions assigned to that category.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt;  With racism, it is the social meaning attached to an individuals race that determines social status.  With colorism it is the social meaning attached to an individuals skin color that determines social status.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt;  In order for a form of discrimination to be considered colorism, differential treatment must not result from racial categorization, but from the social values associated with skin color.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt;

Colorism can be found across the world, specifically in the United States,&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt; Latin America,&lt;ref&gt;Bonilla-Silva, Eduardo. (2009). “The Latin Americanization of US Race Relations: A New Pigmentocracy”, in Shades of Difference, edited by Evelyn Nakano Glenn, Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Asia,&lt;ref&gt;Rondilla, Joanne L. and Paul Spickard. 2007.

Growing trend in Africa: women try to become white. Retrieved February 20, 2012 from http://english.pravda.ru/main/2001/04/18/3748.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The abundance of colorism is a result of the global prevalence of “pigmentocracy,” a term recently adopted by social scientists to describe societies in which wealth and social status are determined by skin color.&lt;ref name=Lynn&gt;Lynn, Richard. "PIGMENTOCRACY: RACIAL HIERARCHIES IN THE CARIBBEAN AND LATIN AMERICA."The Occidental Quarterly 8, no. 2 (2008): 25-44.&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the numerous pigmentocracies across the world, each are characteristic of a society in which the lightest-skinned peoples have the highest social status, followed by the brown-skinned, and finally the black-skinned who are at the bottom of the social hierarchy.&lt;ref name=Lynn /&gt;  This form of prejudice often results in reduced opportunities for those who are discriminated against on the basis of skin color.&lt;ref name=Lynn /&gt;

==In the United States==
Within the United States, colorism can be observed among all races.  Although it occurs most notably among African Americans, it also occurs among Latinos, Indian immigrants, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and even among European Americans.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt;

===African Americans===
====History====
[[European colonialism]] created a system of [[white supremacy]] and racist [[ideology]], which led to a structure of domination that privileged whiteness over blackness.&lt;ref name=Lake&gt;Lake, O. (2003).  Blue veins and kinky hair: Naming and color consciousness in African America. Westport, CT: Praeger&lt;/ref&gt;  Biological differences in skin color were used as a justification for the enslavement and oppression of Africans, developing a social hierarchy that placed whites at the top and blacks at the bottom.&lt;ref name=Lake /&gt;  The desire to rise out of this lower position ultimately caused internalized divisions among African Americans.&lt;ref name=Lake /&gt;

[[Miscegenation]], the mixing of different racial groups  (commonly through the sexual exploitation of black female slaves by white male slave owners) resulted in a large number of mixed race individuals with both African and European ancestry.&lt;ref name=Keith&gt;Keith, V. M., &amp; Herring, C. (1991). Skin tone and stratification in the black community. American Journal of Sociology, 97(3), 760-778&lt;/ref&gt;  Terminology was also developed to distinguish various levels of African ancestry.&lt;ref name=Keith /&gt;  The terms [[mulatto]], [[quadroon]] and [[octoroon]] were used to identify a black person with one-half, one-fourth and one-eighth of African ancestry, respectively.&lt;ref name=Keith /&gt;  Slaves with lighter complexion were allowed to engage in less strenuous tasks, like domestic duties, while the darker slaves participated in hard labor, which was more than likely outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Mark E. "Skin Color and the Perception of Attractiveness Among African Americans: Does Gender Make a Difference?" Social Psychology Quarterly 65.1 (2002): 77-91&lt;/ref&gt; A partial white heritage also gave light-skinned blacks more economic value and caused them to be viewed as smarter and superior to dark-skinned blacks, allowing more advantages in a white-dominated society, such as broader opportunities for education and the acquisition of land and property &lt;ref&gt;Russell, K., Wilson, M., &amp; Hall, R. (1993). The color complex: The politics of skin color among African Americans. New York: Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  

To prevent any confusion in regard to racial classification and to prohibit blacks with white ancestry from gaining the same legal status as full-blooded whites, the rule of hypo-descent, or the "[[one-drop rule]]" was mandated.&lt;ref name=Omi&gt;Omi, M., &amp; Winant, H. (1986). Racial formation in the United States: From the 1960s to the 1980s. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the “one-drop rule," even the smallest amount of African ancestry (or a drop of African blood) legally defined a person as black.&lt;ref name=Omi /&gt; After the abolition of slavery in 1865, however, colorism created an internalized structure of hierarchy and division within the black community, as lighter-skinned blacks began to set themselves apart by socializing, marrying and procreating with one another.&lt;ref name=Kerr&gt;Kerr, A. E. (2006). The paper bag principle: Class, colorism, and rumor in the case of black Washington, DC. Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Around the beginning of the twentieth century, separatist standards, such as the brown paper bag, comb, pencil, and flashlight tests began to be implemented.&lt;ref name=Kerr /&gt;  Also, exclusionary social clubs and societies were developed to create color divisions within black America that would shape socially constructed ideas about skin color.&lt;ref name=Kerr /&gt;

====Examples of African American Colorism====
=====Brown paper bag test=====
The phrase “brown paper bag test” has traditionally been used by African Americans throughout the twentieth and twenty-first century with reference to a ritual once practiced by certain African-American sororities and fraternities who would not let anyone into the group whose skin tone was darker than a paper bag.&lt;ref name=Kerr /&gt;  Also known as a [[paper bag party]], these lighter-skinned social circles reflected an idea of exclusion and exclusiveness.  The notion of the “paper bag” has carried a complex and obscure meaning in black communities for many decades.&lt;ref name=Kerr /&gt;  The reason for the usage of the "paper bag" is because the color of the paper bag is considered to be the "center" marker of blackness that distinguishes “light skin” from “dark skin” on a continuum stretching infinitely from black to white.&lt;ref name=Kerr /&gt;  Also, the brown paper bag is believed to act as a benchmark for certain levels of acceptance and inclusion.&lt;ref name=Kerr /&gt;  [[Spike Lee]]'s film ''[[School Daze]]'' satirized this practice at historically black colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;Spike Lee, “School Daze,”  40 Acres &amp; A Mule Filmworks, Columbia Pictures Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with the "paper bag test," guidelines for acceptance among the lighter ranks included the "comb test" and “pencil test,” which tested the coarseness of one's hair, and the "flashlight test," which tested a person's profile to make sure their features measured up or were close enough to those of the Caucasian race.&lt;ref name=Kerr /&gt;

=====The Bleaching Syndrome=====
A phenomenon known as “The bleaching syndrome,” which refers to the process of attempting to lighten one’s skin, has made a significant impact on the commercial industry and the lives of African Americans since the beginning of the 21st century.&lt;ref name=bleaching&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=161243|title=Bleaching Creams: Fade to Beautiful?|publisher=Northwestern University|date=03-10-2010|accessdate=03-08-2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The roots of the skin bleaching phenomenon stem from African Americans internalizing dominant cultural ideas, without the possibility of full assimilation into American society.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitz,  H. (1978). Race relations in the urban South. New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  A psychological conflict is thus created, causing African Americans to develop a disdain for dark skin as it counters dominant cultural ideals.  In an attempt to simultaneously reduce this conflict and enable assimilation, many African Americans developed the bleaching syndrome.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;Hall, R. (1995). The bleaching syndrome: African American's response to cultural domination vis-A-vis skin color. Journal of Black Studies, 26, 172-184&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the degree of assimilation correlates with skin color based on dominant cultural standards, light skin is crucial relative to the degree of assimilation in the United States.&lt;ref name=Reuter&gt;Reuter,  E. (1969). The mulatto in the United States. New York: Haskell House&lt;/ref&gt;  Coincidentally, lighter skin is thought to be an ideal point of reference for attractiveness and marital partner selection among African Americans.&lt;ref name=Reuter /&gt;  The practice of applying light skin as a point of reference, however, is considered to be culturally self-destructive.&lt;ref name=Reuter /&gt;  Ultimately, the bleaching syndrome is a manifestation of the conflicting circumstances regarding the assimilation of African Americans into dominant cultural values.&lt;ref name=Reuter /&gt;

===Skin Color Paradox===
The Skin Color Paradox refers to the fact that no matter how differently African Americans are treated based on their skin color, their political and cultural attitudes about "blackness" as a form of identity and their feelings of relatedness and solidarity with other blacks tend to remain consistent. Although light-skinned blacks receive many socioeconomic advantages over dark-skinned blacks, who have much more punitive relationships with the criminal justice system and greatly diminished prestige, and although blacks are aware of this disparity in treatment and status, both light-skinned and dark-skinned blacks have similar political attitudes towards discrimination and race solidarity.&lt;ref name="Hochschild, Jennifer L 2007"/&gt;

Political scientists would suggest that skin color is a characteristic perhaps as equally important as religion, income, and education, which is why this paradox is so surprising, but studies show that skin color has no real bearing on actual political preference. Affirmative action is another example of the paradox between colorism on the one hand and political preference on the other. Studies show that most African Americans that benefit from Affirmative action come from families that are better educated and more well off, and historically this means that the lighter-skinned portion of the black race is receiving the majority of the aid, making it appear as if the race as a whole is being benefited. Yet beneficiaries of this special treatment tend to hold on to their political identification with "blackness." &lt;ref name="Hochschild, Jennifer L 2007"/&gt;

===Stereotypes===
The light to dark hierarchy within the African American race is one that has existed since the time of slavery, but its problems and consequences are still very evident and lead to various stereotypes.  Darker skinned blacks are more likely to have negative relationships with the police, less likely to have higher education or income levels, and less likely to hold public office.  Darker skinned people are also considered less intelligent, less desirable in women mostly, and are overall seen as inferior to lighter-skinned people.&lt;ref name="Hochschild, Jennifer L 2007"&gt;Hochschild, Jennifer L. "The Skin Color Paradox and the American Racial Order." Social Forces 86.2 (2007): 643-670.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that when measuring education and family income, there is a positive sloping curve as the skin of families gets lighter. This does not prove that darker skinned people are discriminated against, but it provides insight as to why these statistics are recurring.  Lighter skinned people tend to have higher social standing, more positive social networks, and more opportunities to succeed than those of a darker persuasion. Scientists believe this advantage is due to not only to their ancestors' benefits, but also to skin color. In criminal sentencing, medium to dark-skinned African Americans are likely to receive sentences 2.6 years longer than those of whites or light-skinned African Americans, and when a white victim is involved, those with more "black" features are likely to receive a much more severe punishment, reinforcing the idea that those of lighter complexion are of more "value."&lt;ref name="Hochschild, Jennifer L 2007"/&gt;

The perception of beauty can be influenced by racial stereotypes about skin color; the African American journalist [[Jill Nelson]] wrote that "to be both prettiest and black was impossible"&lt;ref name=tws6nov14/&gt; and elaborated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As a girl and young woman, hair, body, and color were society's trinity in determining female beauty and identity, the cultural and value-laden gang of three that formed the boundaries and determined the extent of women's visibility, influence, and importance. For the most part, they still are. We learn as girls that in ways both subtle and obvious, personal and political, our value as females is largely determined by how we look. As we enter womanhood, the pervasive power of this trinity is demonstrated again and again in how we are treated by the men we meet, the men we work for, the men who wield power, how we treat each other and, most of all, ourselves. For black women, the domination of physical aspects of beauty in women's definition and value render us invisible, partially erased, or obsessed, sometimes for a lifetime, since most of us lack the major talismans of Western beauty. Black women find themselves involved in a lifelong effort to self-define in a culture that provides them no positive reflection.&lt;ref name=tws6nov14&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Media and Public Perception===
The media is responsible for influencing beliefs regarding ideas of beauty in the African American community.  Mass media productions often perpetuate discrimination based on skin color.&lt;ref name=Hodge&gt;Hodge, C (2011) Coping with and contesting colorism in contemporary African American communities. California State University&lt;/ref&gt;  African Americans possessing lighter skin complexion and “European features,” such as lighter eyes, and smaller noses and lips have more opportunities in the media industry.&lt;ref name=Hodge /&gt;  For example, film producers hire lighter-skinned African Americans more often, television producers choose lighter skinned cast members, and magazine editors choose African American models that resemble European features.&lt;ref&gt;Woodard, K (2000). Traumatic Shame: Toni Morrison, Televisual Culture, and the Cultural Politics of the Emotions. Cultural Critique. 46(1), 210-240.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the media industry sends the messages that African Americans with Eurocentric features are more likely to be accepted, diminishing the status of darker-skinned African Americans.&lt;ref name=Hodge /&gt;

In regards to the magazine industry, African American women are rarely showcased in the most popular magazines.&lt;ref name=Hodge /&gt;  Therefore, African American girls have difficultly identifying with the models showcased in these magazines, because they do not represent the type of women that they come into contact with in their own communities.&lt;ref name=Hodge /&gt;  There are also biases towards Caucasians in the advertisements used in these magazines.&lt;ref name=Hodge /&gt;  Recent studies have indicated that the number of racially biased advertisements in magazines have increased over the years.  A content analysis conducted by Scott and Neptune (1997) shows that less than one percent of advertisements in major magazines featured African American models.&lt;ref name=Pious&gt;Pious,  Scott, and Dominique  Neptune  (1997),  "Racial  and Gender Biases  in Magazine  Advertising:  A Content-Analytic Study," Psychology of Women Quarterly, 21 (4), 627-644.&lt;/ref&gt;  When African Americans did appear in advertisements they were mainly portrayed as athletes, entertainers or unskilled laborers.&lt;ref name=Pious /&gt;  In addition, seventy percent of the advertisements that features animal print included African American women.&lt;ref name=Pious /&gt;  Animal print reinforces the stereotypes that African Americans are animalistic in nature, sexually active, less educated, have lower income, and extremely concerned with personal appearances.&lt;ref name=Pious /&gt;

Concerning African American males in the media, darker skinned men are more likely to be portrayed as violent or more threatening, influencing the public perception of African American men.&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt;  Since dark-skinned males are more likely to be linked to crime and misconduct, many people develop preconceived notions about the characteristics of black men.&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt;  Through extreme gangster rap music, reality crime shows, and newscasts, crime has been defined by contemporary media and given a black face despite statistics that paint a different picture.&lt;ref name=Rome&gt;Rome, D. (2004). Black demons: The media’s depiction of the African American male stereotype. Westport, CT: Praeger Press&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, cocaine use has been found to be higher among whites, but African Americans are the dominant figures seen on crime shows such as ''[[Cops (TV series)|Cops]]''.&lt;ref name=Rome /&gt;

The negative public perception of darker-skinned African American places them at a disadvantage in other aspects of society, such as the workforce.&lt;ref name=Hunter&gt;Hunter, Margaret. 2002. “‘If You’re Light You’re Alright’: Light Skin Color as Social Capital for Women of Color.” Gender and Society 16:175–93.&lt;/ref&gt;  Skin color plays a significant role in the acceptance of African Americans in the workforce and can even hold more importance than an individual's credentials and ability.&lt;ref name=Hunter /&gt;  For example, hiring managers generally have a different perception of a light-skinned African American female applicant, compared to a dark-skinned female applicant.&lt;ref name=Hunter /&gt;   Light-skinned African American women were found to have higher salaries than dark-skinned women, and light-skinned women were more satisfied with their jobs in regards to pay and advancement opportunities.&lt;ref name=Hunter /&gt;  Researchers have also termed dark-skinned women as being in a “triple-jeopardy” situation because all three aspects of their identity—their gender, race and skin-tone—can have negative and harmful implications on occupational opportunities and overall feelings of competency.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Maxine S. and Verna M. Keith. 2001. “The Blacker the Berry: Gender, Skin Tone, Self-Esteem, and Self-Efficacy.” Gender &amp; Society 15(3):336–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite exclusion and bias, the media has made an attempt to correct some of the negative images of African Americans.&lt;ref name=Hodge /&gt; Examples of shows in which African Americans have been positively portrayed in the past include ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]''{{Dubious|date=August 2012}} and ''[[A Different World (TV series)|A Different World]]''.&lt;ref name=Hodge /&gt;   In addition, new television specials such as ''Black Girl's Rock'' and ''My Black is Beautiful'' highlight African American men and women for their contributions to society.&lt;ref name=Hodge /&gt;   Overall, these media changes have helped to provide a unique and more accurate representation of black culture in the twenty-first century.&lt;ref name=Hodge /&gt;    Television networks such as ''Centric'' and ''TV One'' and magazines such as ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'' and ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' play a major role in portraying African Americans in a more positive light than they have been portrayed in the past.&lt;ref name=Hodge /&gt;

==In Latin America==
[[Brazil]] has the largest population of African descendants (living outside of Africa) in the world.  This large number was a result of the African Slave trade. In [[Brazil]], skin color plays a large role in differences among the races. Individuals with lighter skin and who are racially mixed generally have higher rates of [[social mobility]].&lt;ref name="Hernandez1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hernandez |first=Tanya K.|year=2006 |title=Bringing Clarity to Race Relations in Brazil
|journal=Diverse: Issues in Higher Education |volume=23|issue=18 |pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a disproportionate number of mostly European descent elites than those of visible African descent. There are large health, education and income disparities between the races in [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name="Santana1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Santana, Almeida-Filho, Roberts, Cooper|first=Vilma, Naomar, Robert, Sharon P.|year=2007|title=Skin Color, Perception of Racism and Depression among Adolescents in Urban Brazil|journal=Child &amp; Adolescent Mental Health |volume=12|issue=3 |pages=125–131|doi=10.1111/j.1475-3588.2007.00447.x |last2=Almeida-Filho |first2=Naomar |last3=Roberts |first3=Robert |last4=Cooper |first4=Sharon P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Latin America, light skin is seen as more attractive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06360/748295-51.stm|title=Documentary, Studies Renew Debate About Skin Color's Impact|publisher=Pittsburg Post Gazette|date=12-26-2006|accessdate=09-08-2010|first=L.A.|last=Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mexico and in Brazil, light skin represents power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/race/2009/02/in-many-different-cultures-and-countries-around-the-world-skin-color-plays-a-huge-role-in-the-concept-of-beauty-lighter-ski/comments/page/2/|title=Is Light Skin Still Preferable to Dark?|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=02-26-2010|accessdate=09-08-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dark skinned person is more likely to be discriminated against in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/multimedia/news/afrolatin/part5/index.html|title=Racism Takes Many Hues|publisher=Miami Herald|date=08-24-2007|accessdate=09-08-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Latin American (particularly South American) actors and actresses have mostly European features - [[blond hair]], light or light-mixed eyes, protruding narrow noses, straight hair and/or pale skin; the same situation happens in Hispanic media of the United States. A light skinned person was considered to be more privileged and have a higher social status. A person with light skin is considered beautiful and it means that the person has more wealth. Those with dark skin and frizzy hair tend to be among the region's poorest and most disenfranchised. Nevertheless, many Brazilians disregard straightening on afro-textured hair as an attitude of shame of their own ethnic and racial origins, and say that persons of African descent should accept themselves as such rather than trying to be "whiter" i.e. fitting in the colourist beauty standards of Latin America. If this reflects more colourism (some Brazilians perceive straightened afro-textured hair as ridiculous in a risible way, especially in a man, which is often labeled as ''[[Homophobic violence in Brazil|viadagem]]'', or a greater politicization with respect to race relations and racism, varies greatly with the person.

==In South Asia==
Even prior to any interactions between [[Europe]]ans and [[South Asia]]ns, colorism has been an issue for South Asian cultures. According to Communist revisionist historians (source needed), color prejudice was introduced due to Aryans from Central Asia invading India in ancient times and subjugating the "dark" indigenous Indians. This form of negationist historical revisionism was part of the British colonial ideology. Much of these theories were simply conjecture fueled by European imperialism. This styling of an Aryan invasion by British colonial fantasies of racial supremacy was incorporated by Communist revisionists as part of waging a [[Trotskyist]] [[permanent revolution]] in India between perceived "whites" and "darks", and has no basis in genetic or anthropological studies of South Asian populations. More recent studies have also debunked the British claims that so-called "Aryans" and "Dravidians" have a "racial divide". A study conducted by the [[Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology]] in 2009 (in collaboration with [[Harvard Medical School]], [[Harvard School of Public Health]] and the Broad Institute of Harvard and [[MIT]]) analyzed half a million genetic markers across the genomes of 132 individuals from 25 ethnic groups from 13 states in India across multiple caste groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/scitech/report_indians-are-one-people-descended-from-two-tribes_1292864 Indians are one people descended from two tribes]&lt;/ref&gt; The study establishes, based on the impossibility of identifying any genetic indicators across caste lines, that castes in South Asia grew out of traditional tribal organizations during the formation of Indian society, and was not the product of any mythical "Aryan Invasion" and "subjugation" of Dravidian people, unlike what British racial-[[revanchist]] and [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] claims would have one believe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/news/india/Aryan-Dravidian-divide-a-myth-Study/articleshow/5053274.cms Aryan-Dravidian divide a myth: Study], [[Times of India]]&lt;/ref&gt;  

The study does go on to state that there were two different populations that originally settled India. They were the [[Ancestral North Indian]] (ANI) in the north and the [[Ancestral South Indian]] (ASI) in the south. Over time these groups mixed together.

Traditionally, Hinduism has never shown a preference for skin color and dark skinned people can be found in all castes of Hindu society. In the [[Mahabharata]], the character known as Krishna was of dark complexion but was an epitome of beauty. The incarnation of Vishnu, [[Krishna]] himself (widely revered by [[Vaishnavites]]), was said to be "as black as a full raincloud".

Individuals in South Asia have tended to see whiter skin as more beautiful. This was most clearly visible in [[British India]], where skin color served as a signal of high status for British. Thus, those individuals with fairer skin color enjoyed more privileges and opportunities than those with dark skin. Anglo-Indians with more European features were often more upwardly mobile and were considered{{Who|date=May 2010}} to have a more affluent status. These individuals gained preferences{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} in education and in employment. Darker skinned individuals were socially and economically disadvantaged due to their appearance. (Beyond the South Asian subcontinent,
persons who were dark-skinned, "black" or "colored" faced a disadvantage in most European-held colonies.)
Most Indian actors and actresses have light skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2008/07/02/blackout.html|title=Blackout|publisher=Newsweek|date=07-03-2008|accessdate=09-08-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary entitled [http://www.vimeo.com/16210769 Shadeism] looks closer at how skin color effects the mindset of women.

==In East Asia==
In eastern parts of Asia, including [[Southeast Asia]], a preference for lighter skin remains prevalent. In ancient China and Japan, for example, pale skin can be traced back to ancient drawings depicting women and goddesses with fair skin tones. In ancient China, Japan, and Southeast Asia, pale skin was seen as a sign of wealth.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Thus, [[skin whitening]] cosmetic products are popular in East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/east/05/13/asia.whitening/|title=Skin Deep: Dying to be White|publisher=CNN|date=05-15-2002|accessdate=09-08-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4 out of 10 women surveyed in [[Hong Kong]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]] and [[South Korea]] used a skin-whitening cream, and more than 60 companies globally compete for Asia's estimated $18 billion market.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pri.org/world/asia/skin-whitening-big-business-asia.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Arab world==
Arab culture beautifies the white color.&lt;ref name=colorism_Arabs&gt;{{Cite book|last=Al-Baqr al-Affif Mukhtar|title=The Crisis of Identity in Northern Sudan: The Dilemma of a Black People with a White Culture|publisher=in Fluehr-Lobban and Rhodes, Race and Identity in the Nile Valley|pages= 213–24.|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular phrase in [[North]]ern [[Sudan]] is "al-Husnu ahmar" (beauty is red)&lt;ref name=colorism_Arabs/&gt; whiteness is the ultimate standard color in most Arab societies.

"Akhdhar" is used as a polite alternative of the word "black" in describing the color of a dark-skinned Arab. The early Arabs used the word "akhdar" (green) to describe people of known Arab nobility and lineage whose color was black. Last and least is azraq.&lt;ref name=colorism_Arabs/&gt;  which literally means "blue", but it is used interchangeably with aswad to mean "black" In the past, however it referred to whiteness or light skin.

==In Africa==
Skin bleaching is popular in Senegal and all across West Africa, especially among women.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=6625808&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americo Liberians===
In Liberia, descendants of African-American settlers (renamed [[Americo-Liberians]]) in part defined social class and standing by raising people with lighter skin above those with dark skin. The first Americo-Liberian presidents such as [[Joseph Jenkins Roberts]], [[James Spriggs-Payne]], and [[Alfred Francis Russell]] had considerable proportions of European ancestry.  Most may have been only one-quarter or one-eighth African American. Other aspects of their rising to power, however, likely related to their chances for having obtained education and work that provided good livings.

[[Edward Roye]] was the first representative of dark-skinned African-American settlers in [[Liberia]]. The light-skinned party was the [[Republican Party (Liberia)]] and the dark-skinned party was the [[True Whig Party]].

In addition to rivalries among descendants of African Americans, the Americans held themselves above the native Africans in Liberia. Thus, descendants of Americans held and kept power out of proportion to their representation in the population of the entire country, so there was a larger issue than color at work.

===Coloureds of South Africa===
[[Coloured]] people consist of three mixed race populations in South Africa who were given more social privilege than other, unmixed, indigenous African groups. During the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid era]], in order to keep divisions and maintain a [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]-focused society, the government used the term ''Coloured'' to describe one of the four main racial groups identified by law: Blacks, [[White South African|Whites]], Coloureds and [[Indian South Africans|Indians]]. (All four terms were capitalised in apartheid-era law.) Many Griqua began to self-identify as "Coloureds" during the apartheid era. There were certain advantages in becoming classified as "Coloured". For example, Coloureds did not have to carry a ''[[dompas]]'' (an identity document designed to limit the movements of the non-white populace), while the Griqua, who were seen as another indigenous African group, did.
