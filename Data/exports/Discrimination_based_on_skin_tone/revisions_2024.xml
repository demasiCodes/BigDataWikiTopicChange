'''Discrimination based on skin tone''', also known as '''colorism''' or '''shadeism''', is a form of [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]] in which people of certain [[ethnic group]]s, or people who are perceived as belonging to a different-skinned [[Race (human categorization)|racial group]], are treated differently based on their different [[Human skin tone|skin tone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jones |first=Trina |date=2000-01-01 |title=Shades of Brown: The Law of Skin Color |url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/faculty_scholarship/72 |journal=[[Duke Law Journal]] |volume=49 |pages=1487–1557 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.233850}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zizumbo-Colunga"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Zizumbo-Colunga |first=Daniel |date=2017-12-13 |title=Study reveals racial inequality in Mexico, disproving its 'race-blind' rhetoric |url=http://theconversation.com/study-reveals-racial-inequality-in-mexico-disproving-its-race-blind-rhetoric-87661 |access-date=2024-04-20 |website=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colorism focuses on how [[racism]] is expressed in the psychology of a people and how it affects their concepts of beauty, wealth, and privilege. A key difference between racism and colorism is that while racism deals with the subjugation of one group by another or the belief in racial supremacy, colorism deals with in-group discrimination in addition to between-group discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sanz Espinar |first=Gemma |date=2022 |title=Hacia un nuevo MCER.

Research has uncovered extensive evidence of [[discrimination]] based on skin color in [[criminal justice]], [[business]], the [[Economic discrimination|economy]], [[housing]], [[health care]], the [[Mass media|media]], and [[politics]] in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. In addition, there has been research that evidently shows biases based on skin color in the educational system. Students of color are facing higher education costs and inequalities in advanced programs and are targeted by their teachers or peers from other marginalized groups. In addition to this issue being documented in the United States, lighter skin tones have been considered preferable in many countries in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], and [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jablonski |first=Nina G. |date=2021 |title=Skin color and race |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=175 |issue=2 |pages=437–447 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.24200 |issn=0002-9483 |pmc=8247429 |pmid=33372701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although less historically significant, prejudice within groups can also be applied toward lighter-skinned people. This is referred to as '''reverse colorism'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hall |first1=Ronald |title=Being light-skinned can lead to 'reverse colorism' in many parts of the world |url=https://theconversation.com/being-light-skinned-can-lead-to-reverse-colorism-in-many-parts-of-the-world-190189 |website=The Conversation |date=8 November 2022 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia ===
In [[South Asia]], a preference for lighter skin is prevalent.&lt;ref name="Skin Deep: Dying to be White"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/east/05/13/asia.whitening/|title=Skin Deep: Dying to be White|date=2002-05-15|publisher=CNN|access-date=2010-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[East Asian]] countries tend to embrace their natural skin tone.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=P.H.|first1=Li, Eric|last2=Jeong|first2=Min, Hyun|last3=W.|first3=Belk, Russell|date=2008-01-01|title=Skin Lightening and Beauty in Four Asian Cultures|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/13415/volumes/v35/NA-35|journal=NA – Advances in Consumer Research|volume=35|access-date=2016-10-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190618001443/http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/13415/volumes/v35/NA-35|archive-date=2019-06-18|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/feminism/2016/01/dark-what-behind-india-s-obsession-skin-whitening|title=In the dark: what is behind India's obsession with skin whitening?|access-date=2017-03-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190618001507/https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/feminism/2016/01/dark-what-behind-india-s-obsession-skin-whitening|archive-date=2019-06-18|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newyorker"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Purnell |first=Newley|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/currency/2013/11/images-spark-racism-debate-in-thailand.html|title=Images Spark Racism Debate in Thailand|magazine=The New Yorker|date=2013-10-31|access-date=2021-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of [[skin whitening]] in East Asia dates back to ancient times. In the ancient dynastic eras, to be light in an area where the sun was harsh implied wealth and nobility, because those privileged persons could stay indoors while servants had to labor outside.&lt;ref name="Skin Deep: Dying to be White"/&gt;

The historical preference for light-skinned women in East Asia is quite different from more recent Western culture, where women of tan and brown complexions are preferred. But color preferences were again associated with privilege: tanning was associated with people who had the leisure for vacations and time to tan. Bonnie Adrian writes that American culture makes white women feel inferior for having pale complexions and reddish features, and that she risked skin cancer and wrinkles trying to darken her pale skin.&lt;ref name="Adrian 2003 p. 165"&gt;{{cite book | last=Adrian | first=B. | title=Framing the Bride: Globalizing Beauty and Romance in Taiwan's Bridal Industry | publisher=University of California Press | year=2003 | isbn=978-0-520-23834-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=saYwDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA165 | access-date=2023-08-04 | page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 21st-century research, women in [[China]] have recently asserted tan skin as the new female beauty ideal, which they view as healthier and more attractive. According to Tai Wei Lim, Chinese women in the media now sport bronze complexions, and this is viewed as a reclamation of women's autonomy from the fading Chinese patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lim |first1=Tai Wei |title=Women Hold Up Half The Sky: The Political-economic And Socioeconomic Narratives Of Women In China |date=22 February 2021 |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=978-981-12-2620-5 |pages=47–48 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F2MhEAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Racism in Japan|Light skin in Japanese culture}}
Hiroshi Wagatsuma writes in [[Daedalus (journal)|''Daedalus'']] that [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]] has long associated [[Human skin color|skin color]] with other physical characteristics that signify degrees of spiritual refinement or degrees of primitiveness.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, there is considerable discrimination and stigma against the skin color of white [[Europe]]an women. Japanese women commonly state that white women's skin is too pale, or that it is rough, [[wrinkle]]d, or has too many spots.&lt;ref name="AminaMire"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mire |first1=Amina |title=Wellness in Whiteness: Biomedicalization and the Promotion of Whiteness and Youth among Women |date=4 September 2019 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-351-23412-2 |page=114 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TKtDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=white+skin+japan+symbolizes&amp;pg=PT114 |language=en |quote=My informants, mainly women insisted that Japanese skin was superior to Caucasian skin.

==== Southeast Asia ====
In certain Southeast Asian countries such as [[Malaysia]], a common beauty ideal is the "[[Eurasian]] look". Locally known as the "pan-Asian look", in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miss Universe Malaysia pageant contestants 'look too western'|date=4 October 2012 |url=http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1053286/miss-universe-malaysia-pageant-contestants-look-too-western}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overuse of pan-Asian faces on billboards and on television screens has been a controversial issue in the country. The issue was highlighted in 2009 when [[Zainuddin Maidin]], a Malaysian politician, called for the reduction of pan-Asian faces, which he claimed dominated TV and billboards, and instead to increase the number of Malay, Chinese, and Indian faces on local television.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2007-02/09/content_805345.htm|title=Malaysian ads move triggers industry row – Chinadaily.com.cn|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indonesia, the 'Eurasian look' can be traced to beauty ideals established by white male colonists from [[the Netherlands]]. White [[Dutch people|Dutch]] male colonists were enamored by the brown skin color and [[black hair]] of Indonesian women. They considered Eurasian Indonesian women's darker complexions as more beautiful than the pale-skinned, [[Blond|blond-haired]] complexions of white Dutch women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gouda |first1=Frances |title=Dutch Culture Overseas: Colonial Practice in the Netherlands Indies, 1900-1942 |date=2008 |publisher=Equinox Publishing |isbn=978-979-3780-62-7 |page=167 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nN6G-lMk_DEC&amp;pg=PA167 |language=en}} "Du Bois seemed unaware of the prurience implicit in his report to the

Women whose complexion possessed a soft sienna incandescence and whose hair was shiny black comprised a particularly handsome "specimen" of womanhood, he insinuated,  which male-defined aesthetic norms ranked higher than pallid, anemic "samples" of European femininity."&lt;/ref&gt; The frequency at which young Dutch men married Indo women was considered an embarrassment for the conservative element of Dutch society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gouda|2008|p=167|ps=: "Half-caste women in the Dutch East Indies are fine physical specimens, varying in skin color from golden brown to nearly white, the constant characteristics being lustrous black eyes and wavy hair. To the average man, the young half-caste is physically more attractive than the pure-blooded Dutch woman. This is born out by the fact that young Dutch bachelors marry half-caste girls with a frequency embarrassing to the conservative Dutch element."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legacy of this 'Eurasian' beauty ideal continues to be reflected in local literature, as it was written in a popular novel that "a golden colored skin is the greatest gift Allah can
bestow upon a woman", in reference to a blonde-haired girl who did not inherit her grandmother's complexion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gouda|2008|p=167|ps=: "In her heart-rending  novel, The Moon on the Water,  Elvire Spier recently described the sorrow experienced by a little blond-haired girl, born in to an old Indies family in the Praenger, whose lily-white skin no longer exuded the bronzed radiance of  her mother's or grandmother's complexion. Her Sundanese great-grandmother commiserated with her anguish about her rosy-colored cheeks, because a koelit langsep, "a golden colored skin is the greatest gift Allah can bestow upon a woman"."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the controversy surrounding the preference for Malaysians who are of mixed Asian (Malay, Chinese, or Indian) and European descent and possess features such as fair skin, some other experts in the industry have said that the use of pan-Asian faces can be used to promote the racial diversity of Malaysians. As the Minister of Information had suggested in 1993, such faces can also be used to promote a product to a diverse racial demographic because of their mixed appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kemper|first=Steven|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqIzh1StFiwC&amp;pg=PA153|title=Buying and Believing: Sri Lankan Advertising and Consumers in a Transnational World|date=1 May 2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226430409|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colorism in India was also fed by the attitudes of Europeans, who favored lighter-skinned people for administrative positions and other prominent social positions, so power was conceptually intertwined with light skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thappa|title=Skin color matters in India|url=https://www.pigmentinternational.com/article.asp?issn=2349-5847;year=2014;volume=1;issue=1;spage=2;epage=4;aulast=Thappa|access-date=2021-10-15|journal=Pigment International|year=2014|volume=1|page=2|doi=10.4103/2349-5847.135419|s2cid=178991050 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rich Indians often tend to be light-skinned due to less exposure to the sun. Also, individuals were judged by their occupation. Being born into a lineage of farmers, for example, would typically make one unable to leave said lineage. Migration between occupations was rare, and though the caste system's legality was altered in 1948, it is still influential and practiced in many parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Indervir|date=2012|title=Social Norms and Occupational Choice: The Case of Caste Systems in India|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313397025|journal=Indian Journal of Economics and Business|volume=11|issue=2|pages=431–454}}&lt;/ref&gt; As these factors generated the caste system, it grew to include both economic standing and societal positioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jayawardene|first=Sureshi|date=December 2016|title=Racialized Casteism: Exposing the Relationship Between Race, Caste, and Colorism Through the Experiences of Africana People in India and Sri Lanka|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44508183|journal=Journal of African American Studies|volume=20|issue=3/4|pages=323–345|doi=10.1007/s12111-016-9333-5|jstor=44508183|s2cid=152002116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existing prejudices also influenced European officials. This sentiment remains.

Colorism has societal implications, many of which severely harm the socioeconomic mobility of darker-skinned Indians. These can manifest in gender stereotyping and regional discrimination. Studies of melanin index (MI) in individuals across regions show that there are variations in skin color, which contribute to the level of discrimination darker-skinned individuals face in these respective regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Iliescu|first1=Florin Mircea|last2=Chaplin|first2=George|last3=Rai|first3=Niraj|last4=Jacobs|first4=Guy S.|last5=Mallick|first5=Chandana Basu|last6=Mishra|first6=Anshuman|last7=Thangaraj|first7=Kumarasamy|last8=Jablonski|first8=Nina G.|date=2018|title=The influences of genes, the environment, and social factors on the evolution of skin color diversity in India|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajhb.23170|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|language=en|volume=30|issue=5|pages=e23170|doi=10.1002/ajhb.23170|pmid=30099804|hdl=20.500.11820/435c03a5-a3ca-4046-aa50-c81c38d08645|s2cid=51966049|issn=1520-6300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jensen|first=Kari B.|date=2020|title=Colorism in Bangladeshi Society|url=https://doi.org/10.21690/foge/2020.63.2f|journal=Focus on Geography|volume=63|doi=10.21690/foge/2020.63.2f|s2cid=216266145}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some regions of India, dark-skinned people are often seen as "dirty" and of lower status than lighter-skinned ones.

=== Chile ===
{{main|Racism in Chile}}

In Chile, there is a wide range of diversity from other cultures and ethnic backgrounds. The diversity in Chile sees colorism through social-economic status, accommodating the preexisting notion that darker skin complexions are less valued. A 2016 study found that [[Chile]]an schoolteachers expected less from their dark-skinned students (''morenos'') than they expected from their light-skinned students (''blancos'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ceppe.uc.cl/index.php/ceppe-en-la-prensa/591-estudio-revela-que-alumnos-de-piel-morena-son-considerados-como-menos-competentes-en-los-colegios-chilenos|title=Estudio revela que alumnos de piel morena son considerados como 'menos competentes' en los colegios chilenos|website=Centro de Estudios de Políticas y Prácticas en Educación CEPPE de la U. Católica y Ediciones UC|language=es|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the differences between being dark and being tanned carry different types of status: being tanned means that people have enough money to go to the beach and buy tanning products. Due to the history of colonization, being darker-skinned (and likely descended from enslaved Africans) means that people are automatically considered members of the lower classes. Current studies have revealed that many Chileans want to have lighter pigmentation. Whiteness is also associated with economic standing; a mixed-race person may be considered "white" if they are obviously educated and successful.

=== Mexico ===
{{main|Racism in Mexico}}

A 2017 study revealed a 45% gap in educational achievement between the darkest- and lightest-skinned [[White Mexicans]] and that wealth in the country similarly correlated to skin color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/study-reveals-racial-inequality-in-mexico-disproving-its-race-blind-rhetoric-87661|title=Study reveals racial inequality in Mexico, disproving its 'race-blind' rhetoric|website=The Conversation|date=13 December 2017 |access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colorism in Mexico is an ongoing problem that strongly affects people of darker skin tones there. Color can affect Mexican citizens' daily lives, their ability to get jobs, and their  basic self-esteem. Mexicans have a long history of ancestry from sources other than indigenous peoples: Spanish, African, German, and other Europeans. The number of Mexicans who identify as mixed race increased from 3 million in 2010 to more than 20 million in 2020 as more individuals began to acknowledge mixed race. Skin color for Mexicans can range from white to black; more than half of Mexican citizens identify as [[mestizo]] or mixed race.&lt;ref name="Zizumbo-Colunga" /&gt;

A study by [[Vanderbilt University]] found that darker skin is strongly associated with decreased wealth and less education. According to Mexico's National Statistics and Geography Institute, the darker the skin tone, the less upward mobility a Mexican citizen may have. This study revealed that Mexicans with the darkest skin tones were the least likely to have finished elementary school. Simultaneously, those with lighter skin tones were more likely to have a university degree. Some of these differences are also attributed to economic differences between people's families of origin, which create gaps between groups.

These findings also indicate that skin tone appears to be associated with educational achievement. Mexicans with the lightest skin tones complete an average of 11 years of schooling, while dark-skinned Mexicans finish an average of 5.3 years of school. A maximal change in skin tone, from lightest to darkest, is associated with a decrease of almost 6 years of schooling, a 51.8% reduction in education.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;Zizumbo-Colunga, Daniel, and Ivan Flores Martinez. “Is Mexico a Post-Racial Country?

The average Mexican is located within the 3rd and 4th wealth quintiles, while Mexicans with darker skin tones are averaged below the 2nd wealth quintile. A maximal change in skin tone in Mexico, from lightest to darkest, is associated with a 51.5% decrease in material wealth.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt; This study also found that while 2.5 percent of white Mexicans surveyed by Vanderbilt's pollsters don't have running water, upward of 11 percent of dark-skinned citizens said they lack this basic necessity. Similarly, 7.5 percent of white Mexicans reported lacking an in-home bathroom, while 20 percent of dark-skinned Mexicans lacked such convenience.&lt;ref name="Zizumbo-Colunga" /&gt; Researchers concluded that not only does the color of one's skin in Mexico negatively predict economic and educational outcomes, but it is also among the strongest factors found in this study.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;

Mexico had traditionally celebrated its "''raza mestiza''", or mixed-race society. For example, in 2017, President [[Enrique Peña Nieto]] declared "''el mestizaje''" (mixed race) "the future of humanity." Although more than half of Mexico's population identifies as mixed race, race and skin color have a greater effect on Mexicans' human development and [[capital accumulation]] than any other variable. Vanderbilt's results show that the skin color gap in Mexico is two times the achievement gap between northern and southern Mexicans, something that is often referred to in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Zizumbo-Colunga" /&gt; Vanderbilt's study shows that the skin color gap is five times greater than the urban/rural divide in Mexico. It has a significantly greater effect on wealth and education than ethnicity (indigenous versus white or mixed) does.&lt;ref name="Zizumbo-Colunga" /&gt;

When Aeromexico recruited new employees in 2013, they specified "''nadie moreno''", or no dark-skinned people. This type of colorism and racism in Mexico is often ignored or explained by cultural divides. Because Mexico consists of ethnic, cultural, and linguistic diversity, many Mexicans argue that darker-skinned citizens tend to live in historically disadvantaged and highly indigenous areas.&lt;ref name="Zizumbo-Colunga" /&gt;

===History===

[[European colonization of the Americas|European colonizers]] created a [[white supremacy|racial hierarchy]] and a race-based [[ideology]], which led to the formation of a structural system of oppression that benefited individuals of European descent over individuals of African descent. Biological differences in skin color were used to justify the [[Slavery in the United States|enslavement]] and [[oppression]] of [[African Americans|Africans]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], leading to the development of a social hierarchy that placed people of European descent at the top and people of African descent at the bottom. Enslaved people with lighter complexions (usually stemming from the [[sexual assault]] of enslaved African women) were allowed to perform less strenuous tasks, like domestic duties, while darker-skinned enslaved people were forced to engage in hard labor, which they usually performed outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hill | first1 = Mark E | year = 2002 | title = Skin Color and the Perception of Attractiveness Among African Americans: Does Gender Make a Difference? | journal = Social Psychology Quarterly | volume = 65 | issue = 1| pages = 77–91 | doi=10.2307/3090169| jstor = 3090169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African-Americans with greater European ancestry and a lighter skin color were considered smarter than and therefore superior to their darker-skinned counterparts. As a result, they were given greater opportunities for education and the acquisition of land and property.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, K., Wilson, M., &amp; Hall, R. (1993). The color complex: The politics of skin color among African Americans. New York: Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Colorism was a device used by European colonists to create division between enslaved Africans and further the idea that being as close to white as possible was the ideal image. One of the first forms of colorism was slave owners deciding that only light-skinned enslaved people would work in the house while the darker-skinned ones were subjected to the harsh conditions of the fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fultz|first=Lauren|date=Summer 2017|title=The Psycho-Social Impact of Colorism Among African American Women: Crossing the Divide|url=http://corescholar.libraries.wright.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1909&amp;context=etd_all|journal=Psychology Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice led to a clear division between the slaves, undermining their solidarity against the slave owners.

A variety of specific cutoff tests for skin color emerged; the most famous one was the [[brown paper bag test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ferris.edu/HTMLS/news/jimcrow/question/2014/february.htm|title=Brown Paper Bag Test – 2014 – Question of the Month – Jim Crow Museum – Ferris State University|website=ferris.edu|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; If people's skins were darker than the color of a brown paper bag, they were considered "too dark". While the origin of this test is unclear, it is best attested to in 20th-century [[African-American culture|black culture]]. During the time when African Americans were forced into slavery, slave owners would use the "paper bag test", which compared their skin color to a paper bag, to distinguish whether their complexion was too dark to work inside the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Ware|first=Leland|title='Color Struck': Intragroup and Cross-racial Color Discrimination|url=https://racism.org/index.php/articles/law-and-justice/citizenship-rights/116-slavery-to-reparations/racial-reentrenchment/1707-colorism001|access-date=2019-10-28|website=Race, Racism and the Law|archive-date=2020-09-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200924122449/https://racism.org/index.php/articles/law-and-justice/citizenship-rights/116-slavery-to-reparations/racial-reentrenchment/1707-colorism001|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; African Americans' desire for lighter complexions and European features goes back to slavery. Enslaved people with lighter complexions would have the privilege of working indoors, while enslaved people with darker skin were required to work outside in the fields. The complexions of African American slaves reflected how they were treated and the severity of their punishments if they did not comply with the lifestyle that they were forced into.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Margaret|date=2007|title=The Persistent Problem of Colorism: Skin Tone, Status, and Inequality|journal=Sociology Compass|volume=1|issue=1|pages=237–254|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9020.2007.00006.x|issn=1751-9020|s2cid=11960841}}&lt;/ref&gt; The access to and resources to purchase [[skincare]] products or services impacted the notions of colorism among African American women, since enslaved and impoverished black women were more limited in their grooming, which affected the way they were treated by their masters. For example, light-skinned black women were marketed as "Negroes fit for domestic service" in their masters' homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lindsey|first1=Treva B|date=2011|title=Black no more: Skin bleaching and the emergence of new negro womanhood beauty culture|journal=Journal of Pan African Studies |volume=4 |pages=97–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the bag test, the comb test and the door test were also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://askmeaboutmyhair.com/testing-blackness/|title=Testing Blackness – Ask Me About My Hair (.com)|date=2014-02-10|work=Ask Me About My Hair (.com)|access-date=2017-11-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524194026/http://askmeaboutmyhair.com/testing-blackness/|archive-date=2015-05-24|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The comb test was used to measure the kinkiness of a person's hair. The objective was for the comb to be able to pass through the hair without stopping. The door test was popular in some African American clubs and churches. The people who were in charge of those clubs and churches would paint their doors a certain shade of brown, similar to the brown paper bag test, and if people's skins were darker than the color of the doors, they were not admitted into the establishments. These tests were used to measure what level of "blackness" was and was not acceptable in the world. Due to lighter-skinned slaves being allowed to work in the house, they were more likely to be educated than darker slaves were.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Keith|first1=Verna M.|last2=Herring|first2=Cedric|date=1991|title=Skin Tone and Stratification in the Black Community|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=97|issue=3|pages=760–764|jstor=2781783|doi=10.1086/229819|s2cid=145588099}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the stereotype that dark people are stupid and ignorant. Scholars predict that in the future, the preferred color of beauty will not be black or white but mixed.&lt;ref name="scholarship.law.berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harris|first1=Angela|title=From Color Line to Color Chart: Racism and Colorism in the New Century |journal=Berkeley Journal of African-American Law &amp; Policy |date=January 2008|volume=10|issue=1|page=53 |doi=10.15779/Z380C9X |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars also predict that the United States will adopt a "multicultural matrix", which will help bridge the racial gap in efforts to achieve racial harmony, termed by some a "[[browning of America]]". The matrix has four components: the mixed race will help fix racial issues; it serves as a sign of racial progress; it suggests that racism is a thing; and it also suggests that the focus on race is racist due to the lack of racial neutrality.&lt;ref name="scholarship.law.berkeley.edu"/&gt; At the same time, some Americans view this "browning" as a sort of [[great replacement|demographic replacement]], which has led to anxiety among some white Americans who feel that their identity and culture are under attack and will be displaced without changes to the US immigration system. [[Eric Kaufmann|Eric Peter Kaufmann]] explored these views among American whites and internationally in the 2018 book ''Whiteshift: Populism, Immigration and the Future of White Majorities''.

A parallel as well as an opposite critique of this theory is made by black scholars, who state that racial neutrality will not eliminate discrimination based on skin color as long as some [[Race (human categorization)|races]] continue to be negatively perceived and unfairly treated. As such, racial "browning" would just be another way to erase dark skin without correcting the bad way in which it is perceived. From this point of view, racial harmonization is not a valid response to racism at all. In his 2008 book ''The Browning of America and the Evasion of Social Justice'', Ronald R. Sundstrom writes:&lt;ref name="Sundstrom"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sundstrom|first1=Ronald Robles|year=2008|chapter=Introduction|editor1-last=Bernasconi|editor1-first=Robert|editor1-link=Robert Bernasconi|editor2-last=Sharpley-Whiting|editor2-first=Tracy Denean|editor2-link=Tracy Denean Sharpley-Whiting|title=The Browning of America and the Evasion of Social Justice|url=https://repository.usfca.edu/read_books/55/|series=Philosophy and Race|publisher=State University of New York Press|page=2|isbn=9780791475850|oclc=187300169}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{blockquote|...African American intellectual elites and public figures, as well as other liberals and progressives &lt;nowiki&gt;[perceive]&lt;/nowiki&gt; the browning of America to be a threat to long-existing, or even traditional, claims of [[social justice]] by Native Americans and especially African Americans. Moreover, not only are their claims somehow threatened, but the very meaning of the legal principles, such as "[[civil rights]]," upon which their claims are based, is also experiencing transformation. For those who harbor such fears, the browning of America brings with it yet another opportunity for the nation to evade social justice.}}

Several authors have noted that a kind of reverse-colorism began to form within the [[African-American]] community after the end of slavery. Lighter-skinned African-Americans were seen by some darker-skinned people as being inauthentic, privileged, or even "poisoned" by whiteness. According to Greg Carter, this attitude was held by many prominent black nationalists, including [[W.E.B. Du Bois]] and [[Marcus Garvey]].&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carter |first1=Greg |title=The United States of the United Races: A Utopian History of Racial Mixing |date=22 April 2013 |publisher=NYU Press |isbn=978-0-8147-7251-5 |page=133 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0O2S-uVHVBsC&amp;dq=%22reverse+colorism%22&amp;pg=PA133 |language=en |quote= "Du Bois, Garvey and their peers had not invented this rhetoric, but they did rearticulate minority antipathy toward racial mixing during the twentieth century into a sort of reverse colorism that held light-skinned kin as privileged, suspect, and poisoned by whiteness."}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibram X. Kendi]] wrote that colorism is a "collection of racist policies [...] substantiated by racist ideas about Light and Dark people".&lt;ref name="Klotz"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klotz |first1=Kelsey |title=Dave Brubeck and the Performance of Whiteness |date=7 February 2023 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-752507-4 |page=194 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y_ujEAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=%22reverse+colorism%22&amp;pg=PA194 |language=en |quote="This may have been an implicit form of reverse colorism.

Ibram X. Kendi, ''How to Be an Antiracist'' *New York, One World, 2019), 110."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronald Hall argues that a form of reverse-colorism may have emerged in the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], where mixed-indigenous ethnic groups have sometimes been rejected as inauthentic or even stigmatized as degenerate, and where varying shades of brown skin have been valued over light skin.&lt;ref name="HallMelanin"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hall |first1=Ronald E. |title=The Melanin Millennium: Skin Color as 21st Century International Discourse |date=11 September 2012 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-94-007-4607-7 |page=103 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ja08r-2GADwC&amp;dq=colorism+reverse&amp;pg=PA103 |language=en |quote="While the process of Americanization of Guahan has resulted in the valuation of color consistent with colorism, the more recent historical experiences of Chamorus and others on Guahan have resulted in a shift from the desirability of a lighter skin color the varying shades of brown skin...This decolonizing experience has interrupted the process of colorism on Guahan and, in some cases, led to a reverse colorism."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], reverse colorism has acted against white women, whose complexions are stigmatized as too pale or "spotted" in comparison to local Asian women.&lt;ref name="AminaMire" /&gt; In [[Southeast Asia]], beauty ideals created by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] white male colonists placed brown-skinned Asian women above white women in the [[feminine beauty ideal|female beauty standard]], leading to the lower socioeconomic status of [[blond]], light-skinned women in [[Indonesia]].{{sfn|Gouda|2008|p=167}}

For example, 62% of darker-skinned Latinos feel that skin color shapes daily life, while 57% of lighter-skinned Latinos feel the same. Colorism can also affect how Hispanic Americans relate to one another. According to the Pew study, nearly half of Hispanic adults say they have often or sometimes heard a Hispanic friend or family member make comments about other Hispanics that might be considered racist or racially insensitive. About half of Latinos feel that discrimination based on race or skin color is a very big problem.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

A 2019 study, which made use of a dataset of the racial makeup of every U.S. sheriff over a 25-year period, found that "the ratio of Black-to-White arrests is significantly higher under White sheriffs" and that the effects appear to be "driven by arrests for less-serious offenses and by targeting Black crime types."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bulman|first=George|s2cid=3616622|title=Law Enforcement Leaders and the Racial Composition of Arrests|journal=Economic Inquiry|issue=4|pages=1842–1858|doi=10.1111/ecin.12800|issn=1465-7295|year=2019|volume=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In-group bias has also been observed when it comes to traffic citations, as black and white cops are more likely to cite out-groups.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Jeremy |last=West |date=February 2018 |title=Racial Bias in Police Investigations |journal=Working Paper |url=https://people.ucsc.edu/~jwest1/articles/West_RacialBiasPolice.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2019 study by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] found that facial-recognition systems were substantially more likely to misidentify the faces of racial minorities.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/19/federal-study-confirms-racial-bias-many-facial-recognition-systems-casts-doubt-their-expanding-use/|title=Federal study confirms racial bias of many facial-recognition systems, casts doubt on their expanding use|date=2019|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ethnic groups, such as Asian-Americans and African-Americans, were up to 100 times more likely to be misidentified than white men.&lt;ref name=":18"/&gt;

A 2018 study in the journal ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' found that tall young black men are especially likely to receive unjustified attention by law enforcement.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hester|first1=Neil|last2=Gray|first2=Kurt|date=2018-02-21|title=For Black men, being tall increases threat stereotyping and police stops |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=115|issue=11|pages=2711–2715|doi=10.1073/pnas.1714454115|pmid=29483263|pmc=5856523|bibcode=2018PNAS..115.2711H |issn=0027-8424|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors furthermore found a "causal link between perceptions of height and perceptions of threat for Black men, particularly for perceivers who endorse stereotypes that Black people are more threatening than White people."&lt;ref name=":17"/&gt;

Analysis of more than 20 million traffic stops in North Carolina showed that blacks were more than twice as likely as whites to be pulled over by police for traffic stops and that blacks were more likely to be searched following the stop. There was no significant difference in the likelihood that Hispanics would be pulled over, but Hispanics were much more likely to be searched following a traffic stop than whites. When the study controlled for searches in high-crime areas, it still found that police disproportionately targeted black individuals. These racial disparities were particularly pronounced for young men. The study found that whites who were searched were more likely to carry contraband than blacks and Hispanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/07/17/what-data-on-20-million-traffic-stops-can-tell-us-about-driving-while-black/|title=Analysis {{!}} What data on 20 million traffic stops can tell us about 'driving while black'|newspaper=Washington Post|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Suspect Citizens|last1=Baumgartner|first1=Frank R.|last2=Epp|first2=Derek A.|last3=Shoub|first3=Kelsey|s2cid=158379135|date=2018-07-10|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781108553599|doi=10.1017/9781108553599}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2020 study in the journal ''Nature'' found that black drivers were stopped more often than white drivers and that the threshold by which police decided to search black and Hispanic drivers was lower than that for whites (judging by the rate at which contraband was found in searches).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pierson|first1=Emma|last2=Simoiu|first2=Camelia|last3=Overgoor|first3=Jan|last4=Corbett-Davies|first4=Sam|last5=Jenson|first5=Daniel|last6=Shoemaker|first6=Amy|last7=Ramachandran|first7=Vignesh|last8=Barghouty|first8=Phoebe|last9=Phillips|first9=Cheryl|last10=Shroff|first10=Ravi|last11=Goel|first11=Sharad|date=2020-05-04|title=A large-scale analysis of racial disparities in police stops across the United States|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|volume=4|issue=7|pages=736–745|doi=10.1038/s41562-020-0858-1|pmid=32367028|issn=2397-3374|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2021 study in the ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' found similar results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Feigenberg|first1=Benjamin|last2=Miller|first2=Conrad|date=2021|title=Would Eliminating Racial Disparities in Motor Vehicle Searches Have Efficiency Costs?*|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjab018|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=137|pages=49–113|doi=10.1093/qje/qjab018|issn=0033-5533}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2021 study in the ''American Economic Review'' found that minorities were significantly less likely to receive discounts on their traffic tickets than white drivers; the study estimated that 42% of [[Florida Highway Patrol]] officers practiced racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Goncalves|first1=Felipe|last2=Mello|first2=Steven|date=2021|title=A Few Bad Apples?

====Police killings and use of force====
[[File:Black Lives Matter.jpg|thumb|"Black Lives Matter" protests]]
Racism is also present in policing. For instance, the United Kingdom's "stop and search" laws have been disproportionately used against black people, specifically black men. Excessive force against black people is also common in the United States. Police in the United States disproportionately killed unarmed black Americans compared to unarmed white Americans.&lt;ref name=":26"/&gt; These discrepancies led to the creation of the [[Black Lives Matter]] (BLM) movement. The movement began in the US in 2012, after the [[killing of Trayvon Martin]], a 17-year-old unarmed African-American, by [[George Zimmerman]]. Zimmerman claimed self-defense and was acquitted of murder at trial. The movement skyrocketed after many high-profile killings of unarmed African Americans by the police, including the [[murder of George Floyd]].&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; However, BLM also faces criticism, and the "[[All Lives Matter]]" (ALM) movement emerged as a response. Thus, there is an ongoing debate on the motifs of the ALM. Former US President [[Donald Trump]] and some other Republicans{{which|date=October 2023}} declared the BLM as racist and the ALM as more inclusive and color-blind.&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;

A 2016 study by [[Roland G. Fryer, Jr.]], of the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] ({{abbr|NBER|National Bureau of Economic Research}}) found that while overall "blacks are 21 percent more likely than whites to be involved in an interaction with police in which at least a weapon is drawn" and that in the raw data from [[Stop-and-frisk in New York City|New York City's Stop and Frisk program]], "[[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|blacks and Hispanics]] are more than fifty percent more likely to have an interaction with police which involves any use of force" after "[p]artitioning the data in myriad ways, we find no evidence of racial discrimination in officer-involved shootings."{{refn|name=fryer1|{{cite journal |surname=Fryer|given=Roland Gerhard|author-link=Roland G.

After the NBER study was published in the [[peer review]]ed ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'', a comment on it by [[Steven Durlauf]] and [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] recipient [[James Heckman]] of the [[Harris School of Public Policy Studies]] at the [[University of Chicago]] said, "[i]n our judgment, this paper does ''not'' establish credible evidence on the presence or absence of discrimination against African Americans in police shootings."&lt;ref name="fryer1_com"&gt;{{cite journal|surname=Durlauf|given=Steven Neil|author-link=Steven Durlauf|surname2=Heckman|given2=James Joseph|author-link2=James Heckman|title=An Empirical Analysis of Racial Differences in Police Use of Force: A Comment|journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]]|date=2020-07-21|volume=128|number=10|pages=3998–4002|publisher=[[University of Chicago]]|doi=10.1086/710976|doi-access=free|oclc=8672021465|issn=0022-3808}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NBER study's author, [[Roland G.

====Sentencing====
Research has found evidence of in-group bias, where "black (white) juveniles who are randomly assigned to black (white) judges are more likely to get incarcerated (as opposed to being placed on probation), and they receive longer sentences."&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

A 2018 study in the ''American Economic Journal: Applied Economics'' found that judges gave longer sentences, in particular to black defendants, after their favorite team lost a home game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Eren|first1=Ozkan|last2=Mocan|first2=Naci|date=2018|title=Emotional Judges and Unlucky Juveniles|journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|volume=10|issue=3|pages=171–205|doi=10.1257/app.20160390|issn=1945-7782|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study in the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'' found that 9% of the black-white gap in sentencing could not be accounted for.&lt;ref name=":19"/&gt; The elimination of unexplained sentencing disparities would reduce "the steady-state level of black men in federal prison by 8,000–11,000 men [out of the black male prison population of 95,000] and save $230–$320 million per year in direct costs."&lt;ref name=":19"/&gt; The majority of the unexplained sentencing disparity appears to occur at the point when prosecutors decide to bring charges carrying "mandatory minimum" sentences.&lt;ref name=":19"/&gt; A 2018 paper by Alma Cohen and Crystal Yang of [[Harvard Law School]] found that "Republican-appointed judges give substantially longer prison sentences to black offenders versus observably similar non-black offenders compared to Democratic-appointed judges within the same district court."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Cohen|first1=Alma|last2=Yang|first2=Crystal|date=2018|title=Judicial Politics and Sentencing Decisions |website=National Bureau of Economic Research |series=Working Paper Series |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w24615|doi=10.3386/w24615 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In criminal sentencing, medium- to dark-skinned African Americans are likely to receive sentences 2.6 years longer than those of whites or light-skinned African Americans. When a white victim is involved, those with more "black" features are likely to receive a much more severe punishment.&lt;ref name="Hochschild, Jennifer L 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hochschild | first1 = Jennifer L | year = 2007 | title = The Skin Color Paradox and the American Racial Order | journal = Social Forces | volume = 86 | issue = 2| pages = 643–670 | doi=10.1093/sf/86.2.643| s2cid = 145637304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 report by the ''[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]'' found that Florida judges sentence black defendants to far longer prison sentences than whites with the same background.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://projects.heraldtribune.com/bias/sentencing/|title=Same background. Same crime. Different race. Different sentence.|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the same drug possession crimes, blacks were sentenced to double the time of whites.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt; Blacks were given longer sentences in 60 percent of felony cases, 68 percent of the most serious first-degree crimes, 45 percent of burglary cases, and 30 percent of battery cases.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt; For third-degree felonies (the least serious types of felonies in Florida), white judges sentenced blacks to twenty percent more time than whites, whereas black judges gave more balanced sentences.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt;

A 2017 report by the [[United States Sentencing Commission]] (USSC) found, "after controlling for a wide variety of sentencing factors" (such as age, education, citizenship, weapon possession, and prior criminal history), that "Black male offenders received sentences on average 19.1 percent longer than similarly situated White male offenders".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/16/black-men-sentenced-to-more-time-for-committing-the-exact-same-crime-as-a-white-person-study-finds/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116220952/https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/16/black-men-sentenced-to-more-time-for-committing-the-exact-same-crime-as-a-white-person-study-finds/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-11-16|title=Black men sentenced to more time for committing the exact same crime as a white person, study finds|website=washingtonpost.com|access-date=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ussc.gov/research/research-reports/demographic-differences-sentencing|title=Demographic Differences in Sentencing|date=2017-11-13|work=United States Sentencing Commission|access-date=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study on the application of the death penalty in Connecticut over the period 1973–2007 found "that minority defendants who kill white victims are capitally charged at substantially higher rates than minority defendants who kill minorities... There is also strong and statistically significant evidence that minority defendants who kill whites are more likely to end up with capital sentences than comparable cases with white defendants."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donohue|first=John J.|s2cid=39548863|date=2014-10-28|title=An Empirical Evaluation of the Connecticut Death Penalty System Since 1973: Are There Unlawful Racial, Gender, and Geographic Disparities?|journal=Journal of Empirical Legal Studies|volume=11|issue=4|pages=637–696|doi=10.1111/jels.12052|issn=1740-1453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prison system, parole, and pardons====
A 2016 analysis by the ''New York Times'' found that "tens of thousands of disciplinary cases against inmates in 2015, hundreds of pages of internal reports and three years of parole decisions found that racial disparities were embedded in the prison experience in New York."&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/03/nyregion/new-york-state-prisons-inmates-racial-bias.html|title=The Scourge of Racial Bias in New York State's Prisons|last1=Winerip|first1=Michael Schwirtz, Michael|date=2016-12-03|last2=Gebeloff|first2=Robert|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blacks and Latinos were sent more frequently to solitary and held there for longer durations than whites.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; The ''New York Times'' analysis found that the disparities were greatest for violations where the prison guards had much discretion, such as disobeying orders, but smaller for violations that required physical evidence, such as possessing contraband.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;

According to a 2011 ''[[ProPublica]]'' analysis, "whites are nearly four times as likely as minorities to win a pardon, even when the type of crime and severity of sentence are taken into account."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/shades-of-mercy-presidential-forgiveness-heavily-favors-whites|title=Presidential Pardons Heavily Favor Whites|date=2011-12-03|website=ProPublica|first1=Dafna|last1=Linzer|first2=Jennifer|last2=LaFleur|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) that [[Desegregation|integrated]], equal schools should be accessible to all children unbiased to skin color. Currently, in the United States, not all state-funded schools are equally funded. Schools are funded by "federal, state, and local governments", while "states play a large and increasing role in education funding."&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.edcentral.org/edcyclopedia/school-finance/|title=School Finance – EdCentral|newspaper=EdCentral|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Property tax]]es support most of the funding that the local government provides for education."&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt; Schools in lower-income areas get less funding than schools in higher-income areas because all funding for education is based on property taxes. The [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] reports that "many high-poverty schools receive less than their fair share of state and local funding, leaving students in high-poverty schools with fewer resources than schools which are attended by their wealthier peers."&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/more-40-low-income-schools-dont-get-fair-share-state-and-local-funds-department-|title=More Than 40% of Low-Income Schools Don't Get a Fair Share of State and Local Funds, Department of Education Research Finds {{!}} U.S. Department of Education|website=ed.gov|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Department of Education also says this fact affects "more than 40% of low-income schools".&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Children of color are much more likely to suffer from poverty than white children. Furthermore, an article from 2015 informs that since black students finance their education through debt, the chances of them receiving a college degree worsen.&lt;ref name="College Opp"&gt;{{Cite report |url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED571120 |title=The State of Higher Education in California: Blacks |last=Valliani |first=Nadia |date=May 2015 |publisher=Campaign for College Opportunity |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; And because education does not lead to economic equality for black employees, the excessive deficit that black students are taking on to pay for their education is widening the wealth disparity between races.&lt;ref name="College Opp" /&gt; The statistics from the article show the average white college graduate has more than seven times as much wealth as the average black graduate.&lt;ref name="College Opp" /&gt; Therefore, students of color are more likely to have lower educational outcomes because of the wealth differences.

A 2015 study that used correspondence tests "found that when they are considering requests from prospective students who are seeking mentoring in the future, faculty were significantly more responsive to White males than they were to all other categories of students, collectively, particularly in higher-paying disciplines and private institutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Milkman|first1=Katherine L.|author-link=Katy Milkman|last2=Akinola|first2=Modupe|author-link2=Modupe Akinola|last3=Chugh|first3=Dolly|date=2015-11-01|title=What happens before?

A 2016 study in the journal ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]]'' found that blacks and Hispanics were systemically underrepresented in education programs for [[Intellectual giftedness|gifted children]] where teachers and parents referred students to those programs; when a universal screening program based on IQ was used to refer students, the disparity was significantly reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Card|first1=David|last2=Giuliano|first2=Laura|date=2016-11-29|title=Universal screening increases the representation of low-income and minority students in gifted education|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=113|issue=48|pages=13678–13683|doi=10.1073/pnas.1605043113|issn=0027-8424|pmc=5137751|pmid=27856741|bibcode=2016PNAS..11313678C |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An article from 2000 mentions the inequalities students of color have when accessing advanced classes or programs for gifted students.

The phrase "brown paper bag test", or [[paper bag party]], along with the "ruler test", refers to a ritual that was once done by certain African-American sororities and fraternities that would not let anyone into the group if his or her skin was darker than a brown paper bag.&lt;ref name="Kerr"&gt;Kerr, A. E. (2006). The paper bag principle: Class, colorism, and rumor in the case of black Washington, DC. Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spike Lee]]'s film ''[[School Daze]]'' satirized this practice at historically black colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;Spike Lee, "School Daze," 40 Acres &amp; A Mule Filmworks, Columbia Pictures Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the "paper bag test", guidelines for acceptance among the lighter ranks included the "comb test" and the "pencil test", which tested the coarseness of one's hair, and the "flashlight test", which tested a person's profile in order to make sure that their features measured up or were close enough to those of the Caucasian race.&lt;ref name="Kerr"/&gt;

A 2013 study used [[spectrophotometer]] readings to quantify the skin color of respondents. White women experience discrimination in education, with those women with darker skin graduating from college at lower rates than those with lighter skin. This precise and repeatable test of skin color revealed that white women experience skin color discrimination in education at levels that are consistent with the levels of skin color discrimination experienced by African-Americans. White men are not affected in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Branigan|first1=Amelia|last2=Freese|first2=Jeremy|last3=Patir|first3=Assaf|last4=McDade|first4=Thomas|last5=Liu|first5=Kiang|last6=Kiefe|first6=Catarina|title=Skin color, sex, and educational attainment in the post-civil rights era|journal=Social Science Research|date=November 2013|volume=42|issue=6|pages=1659–1674|pmid=24090859|doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2013.07.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Housing discrimination in the United States}}

Moreover, agents' marketing efforts increase with asking price for white, but not for black, customers; blacks are more likely than whites to see houses in suburban, integrated areas ([[Racial steering|steering]]); and the houses agents show are more likely to deviate from the initial request when the customer is black than when the customer is white.

A 2017 paper by Troesken and Walsh found that pre-20th century cities "created and sustained residential segregation through private norms and vigilante activity." However, "when these private arrangements began to break down during the early 1900s", whites started "lobbying municipal governments for segregation ordinances". As a result, cities passed ordinances that "prohibited members of the majority racial group on a given city block from selling or renting property to members of another racial group" between 1909 and 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Walsh|first1=Randall|last2=Troesken|first2=Werner|title=Collective Action, White Flight, and the Origins of Racial Zoning Laws|journal=The Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization|volume=35|issue=2|pages=289–318|doi=10.1093/jleo/ewz006|year=2019|hdl=10.1093/jleo/ewz006|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
Colorism in movies, print, and music can take several forms. It can be the representation of people of color in an ill light, the hiring of actors based on their skin color, the use of colors in costumes with the intention to differentiate between good and evil characters, or simply failing to represent people of color at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Colorism In Media – The West Georgian|date=14 September 2018 |url=http://thewestgeorgian.com/colorism-in-media/|access-date=2021-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African Americans with lighter skin tone and "European features", such as lighter eyes and smaller noses and lips, have more opportunities in the media industry. For example, film producers hire lighter-skinned African Americans more often, television producers choose lighter-skinned cast members, and magazine editors choose African American models that resemble European features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodard | first1 = K | year = 2000 | title = Traumatic Shame: Toni Morrison, Televisual Culture, and the Cultural Politics of the Emotions | journal = Cultural Critique | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 210–240 | doi=10.2307/1354414| jstor = 1354414}}&lt;/ref&gt; A content analysis conducted by Scott and Neptune (1997) shows that less than one percent of advertisements in major magazines featured African American models. When African Americans did appear in advertisements, they were mainly portrayed as athletes, entertainers, or unskilled laborers. In addition, seventy percent of the advertisements that featured animal print included African American women. Animal print reinforces the stereotypes that African Americans are animalistic in nature, sexually active, less educated, have lower income, and are extremely concerned with their personal appearances.&lt;ref name="Pious"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pious | first1 = Scott | last2 = Neptune | first2 = Dominique | year = 1997 | title = Racial and Gender Biases in Magazine Advertising: A Content-Analytic Study | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 627–644 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00135.x| s2cid = 12155745}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning African American males in the media, darker-skinned men are more likely to be portrayed as violent or more threatening, influencing the public perception of African American men. Since dark-skinned males are more likely to be linked to crime and misconduct, many people develop preconceived notions about the characteristics of black men.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1995|title=The bleaching syndrome: African American's response to cultural domination vis-A-vis skin color|journal=Journal of Black Studies|volume=26|issue=2|pages=172–184|doi=10.1177/002193479502600205|last1=Hall|first1=R|s2cid=143934823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colorism was, and still is, very evident in the media. An example of this is the [[minstrel show]]s that were popular during and after slavery. Minstrel shows were a very popular form of theater that involved white and black people in blackface, portraying black people while doing demeaning things. The actors painted their faces with black paint and overlined their lips with bright red lipstick to exaggerate and make fun of black people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/jackson/minstrel/minstrel.html|title=The Minstrel Show|website=chnm.gmu.edu|access-date=2017-11-14|archive-date=2017-11-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171128092832/http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/jackson/minstrel/minstrel.html|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; When minstrel shows died out and television became popular, black actors were rarely hired, and when they were, they had very specific roles. These roles included being servants, slaves, idiots, and criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Punyanunt|first=Narissa|title=The Perceived Realism of African American Portrayals on Television|journal=The Howard Journal of Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research suggests that white voters' voting behavior is motivated by racial threat. A 2016 study, for instance, found that white Chicago voters' turnout decreased when public housing was reconstructed and 25,000 African Americans were displaced. This suggests that white voters' turnout decreased due to not living in proximity to African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enos|first=Ryan D.|s2cid=51895998|date=2016-01-01|title=What the Demolition of Public Housing Teaches Us about the Impact of Racial Threat on Political Behavior |journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=60|issue=1|pages=123–142|doi=10.1111/ajps.12156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Voter ID laws in the United States|Voter ID laws]] have brought on accusations of racial discrimination. In a 2014 review by the [[Government Accountability Office]] of the academic literature, three studies out of five found that voter ID laws reduced minority turnout, whereas two studies found no significant impact.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-14-634|title=Elections: Issues Related to State Voter Identification Laws [Reissued on February 27, 2015]|website=gao.gov|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disparate impact may also be reflected in access to information about voter ID laws. A 2015 experimental study found that election officials queried about voter ID laws are more likely to respond to emails from a non-Latino white name (70.5% response rate) than a Latino name (64.8% response rate), though response accuracy was similar across groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=White|first1=Ariel R.|last2=Nathan|first2=Noah L.|last3=Faller|first3=Julie K.|date=2015-02-01|title=What Do I Need to Vote?

A 2012 study in the city of Boston found that black and Hispanic voters were more likely to be asked for ID during the 2008 election. According to exit polls, 23% of whites, 33% of blacks, and 38% of Hispanics were asked for ID, though this effect is partially attributed to blacks and Hispanics preferring non-peak voting hours when election officials inspected a greater portion of IDs.

A 2018 study found evidence of racial-motivated reasoning as voters assessed President [[Barack Obama]]'s economic performance. The study found that "Whites attributed more responsibility to Obama under negative economic conditions (i.e., blame) than positive economic conditions (i.e., credit).

===Beauty===

Susan L.

However, an actual study that sought to test this hypothesis found no evidence of a "Eurocentric beauty standard" for women.
