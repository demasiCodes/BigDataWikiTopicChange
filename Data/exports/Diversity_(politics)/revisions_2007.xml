In the political arena, the term '''diversity''' (or diverse) is used to describe political entities (neighborhoods, cities, nations, student bodies, etc.) with members who have identifiable differences (racial, religious, generational, etc.) in their backgrounds or lifestyles.  Political [[creed]]s which support the idea diversity is valuable and desirable hold that recognizing and promoting these diverse cultures may aid [[communication]] between people of different backgrounds and lifestyles, leading to greater knowledge, understanding, and peaceful coexistence.{{Fact|date=August 2007}} For example, "Respect for Diversity" is one of the six principles of the [[Global Greens Charter]], a [[manifesto]] subscribed to by [[Green party|Green parties]] from all over the world. In contrast to diversity, some political creeds promote [[cultural assimilation]] as the process to lead to these ends.

'''Diversity''' frequently encompasses differences in racial or [[ethnic group|ethnic classifications]], age, [[gender]], [[religion]], philosophy, [[disability|physical abilities]], [[socioeconomic]] background, [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[intelligence]], [[mental health]], physical [[health]], [[genetic]] attributes, [[behavior]], [[attractiveness]], cultural values and politics. 

This use of '''diversity''' in this sense also extends to American [[academia]], wherein an attempt to create a "diverse student body" typically supports the [[recruitment]] of [[students]] from historically excluded populations, such as students of [[African-American]] or [[latino|Latina/o]] background as well as women in such historically underrepresented fields as the [[sciences]].
