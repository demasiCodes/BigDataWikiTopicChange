'''Diversity'''  as seen in [[sociology]] and [[political studies]] is the degree of differences in identifying features among the members of a purposefully defined group, such as any group differences in racial or [[ethnic group|ethnic classifications]], age, [[gender]], [[religion]], philosophy, [[disability|physical abilities]], [[socioeconomic]] background, [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[intelligence]], [[mental health]], physical [[health]], [[Genetics|genetic]] attributes, [[personality]], [[behavior]] or [[attractiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.qcc.cuny.edu/|title=Queensborough Community College|website=www.qcc.cuny.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When measuring human diversity, a [[diversity index]] exemplifies the likelihood that two randomly selected residents have different ethnicities. If all residents are of the same ethnic group it is zero by definition. If half are from one group and half from another, it is 50. The diversity index does not take into account the willingness of individuals to cooperate with those of other ethnicities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.latimes.com/mapping-la/neighborhoods/diversity/neighborhood/list/ "Mapping L.A..," ''Los Angeles Times'' website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International human rights==
The [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] affirms to "respect difference and acceptance of persons with disabilities as human diversity and [[human nature|humanity]]" for protection of human rights of persons with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], Article 3 "General Principles", (c)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
{{Main|Diversity ideologies|New Left|Multiculturalism}}
Political [[creed]]s which support the idea that diversity is valuable and desirable hold that recognizing and promoting these diverse cultures may aid [[communication]] between people of different backgrounds and lifestyles, leading to greater knowledge, understanding, and peaceful coexistence.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} For example, "Respect for Diversity" is one of the six principles of the [[Global Greens Charter]], a [[manifesto]] subscribed to by [[Green party|Green parties]] from all over the world. In contrast to diversity, some political creeds promote [[cultural assimilation]] as the process to lead to these ends.

===Use in American academy===
This use of ''diversity'' in this sense also extends to American [[academy]], where in an attempt to create a "diverse student body" typically supports the [[recruitment]] of [[students]] from historically excluded populations, such as students of [[African-American]] or [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] background as well as women in such historically underrepresented fields as the [[sciences]].

== Business and workplace ==
Corporations make commitments to diversity in their personnel both for reasons of brand halo and competitive advantage, but progress is slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rsmdiscovery/2018/08/22/why-workplace-diversity-is-so-important-and-why-its-so-hard-to-achieve/|title=Why Workplace Diversity Is So Important, And Why It's So Hard To Achieve|last=Discovery|first=R.
