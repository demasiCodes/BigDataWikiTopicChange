'''Diversity''' within groups is a key concept in [[sociology]] and [[political science]] that refers to the degree of difference along socially significant identifying features among the members of a purposefully defined group, such as any group differences in [[Race (human categorization)|racial]] or [[Ethnicity|ethnic classifications]], [[Ageing|age]], [[gender]], [[religion]], [[philosophy]], [[Disability|physical abilities]], [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic background]], [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[intelligence]], [[Health|physical health]], [[mental health]], [[Genetics|genetic attributes]], [[personality]], [[behavior]], or [[Physical attractiveness|attractiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.qcc.cuny.edu/|title=Queensborough Community College|website=www.qcc.cuny.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When measuring human diversity, a [[diversity index]] exemplifies the likelihood that two randomly selected residents have different ethnicities. If all residents are of the same ethnic group it is zero by definition. If half are from one group and half from another, it is 50. The diversity index does not take into account the willingness of individuals to cooperate with those of other ethnicities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.latimes.com/mapping-la/neighborhoods/diversity/neighborhood/list/ "Mapping L.A..," ''Los Angeles Times'' website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International human rights==
{{Further|Inclusion (disability rights)}}
The [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] affirms to "respect difference and acceptance of persons with disabilities as human diversity and [[human nature|humanity]]" for protection of human rights of persons with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], Article 3 "General Principles", (c)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
{{Main|Diversity ideologies|New Left|Multiculturalism}}
Political [[creed]]s which support the idea that diversity is valuable and desirable hold that recognizing and promoting these {{Which?|date=December 2021}} diverse cultures may aid [[communication]] between people of different backgrounds and lifestyles, leading to greater knowledge, understanding, and peaceful coexistence.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} For example, "Respect for Diversity" is one of the six principles of the [[Global Greens Charter]], a [[manifesto]] subscribed to by [[Green party|green parties]] from all over the world. In contrast to diversity, some political creeds promote [[cultural assimilation]] as the process to lead to these ends.

===Use in American academy===
This use of ''diversity'' in this sense {{Which?|date=December 2021}} also extends to American [[academy]], where in an attempt to create a "diverse student body" typically supports the [[recruitment]] of [[students]] from historically excluded populations, such as students of [[African Americans|African American]] or [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] background as well as women in such historically underrepresented fields as the [[sciences]].{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}

==Business and workplace==
Corporations make commitments to diversity in their personnel both for reasons of brand halo and competitive advantage, but progress is slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rsmdiscovery/2018/08/22/why-workplace-diversity-is-so-important-and-why-its-so-hard-to-achieve/|title=Why Workplace Diversity Is So Important, And Why It's So Hard To Achieve|last=Discovery|first=R.

==Gender in Politics==
Historically, women have been underrepresented in politics compared to men. Women's rights movements, such as [[feminism]], have addressed the marginalization of women in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Celis|first=Karen|date=2013-11-01|title=Representativity in times of diversity: The political representation of women|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277539513001283|journal=Women's Studies International Forum|series=Pregnant politicians and sexy fathers?

===United Kingdom===
Among the 61 Prime Ministers of the U.K. (Kingdom of Great Britain until 1801) there have been 3 women: [[Margaret Thatcher]] (1979&amp;ndash;1990), [[Theresa May]] (2016&amp;ndash;2019), [[Liz Truss]] (2022).

==Race in politics==
===United Kingdom===
[[Rishi Sunak]] (since 2022) is the first non-white Prime Minister of the U.K.
===United States===
In American politics, white men have often been represented more compared to people of color. There has only been one black president, [[Barack Obama]]. All of the other 44 U.S. presidents have been white men. In other sections of U.S. politics, the number of people of color represented has gradually increased each year since the 20th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Uberoi|first=Elise|last2=Burton|first2=Matthew|date=September 30, 2022|title=Ethnic diversity in politics and public life|url=https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn01156/|access-date=November 5, 2022|website=The House of Commons Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;
