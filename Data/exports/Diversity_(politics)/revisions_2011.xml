In the political arena, the term '''diversity''' (or ''diverse'') is used to describe political entities (neighborhoods, student bodies, etc) with members who have identifiable differences in their backgrounds or lifestyles.  

The term describes differences in racial or [[ethnic group|ethnic classifications]], age, [[gender]], [[religion]], philosophy, [[disability|physical abilities]], [[socioeconomic]] background, [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[intelligence]], [[mental health]], physical [[health]], [[Genetics|genetic]] attributes, [[behavior]], [[attractiveness]], or other identifying features. 

In measuring human diversity, a [[diversity index]] measures the probability that any two residents, chosen at random, would be of different ethnicities. If all residents are of the same ethnic group it's zero. If half are from one group and half from another it's .50.&lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.latimes.com/mapping-la/neighborhoods/diversity/neighborhood/list/ "Mapping L.A..," ''Los Angeles Times'' website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
{{Main|New Left|Multiculturalism}}
Political [[creed]]s which support the idea that diversity is valuable and desirable hold that recognizing and promoting these diverse cultures may aid [[communication]] between people of different backgrounds and lifestyles, leading to greater knowledge, understanding, and peaceful coexistence.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} For example, "Respect for Diversity" is one of the six principles of the [[Global Greens Charter]], a [[manifesto]] subscribed to by [[Green party|Green parties]] from all over the world. In contrast to diversity, some political creeds promote [[cultural assimilation]] as the process to lead to these ends.

===Use in American academia===
This use of ''diversity'' in this sense also extends to American [[academia]], where in an attempt to create a "diverse student body" typically supports the [[recruitment]] of [[students]] from historically excluded populations, such as students of [[African-American]] or [[Latino]] background as well as women in such historically underrepresented fields as the [[sciences]].
