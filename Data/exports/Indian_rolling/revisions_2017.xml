'''Indian rolling''' (or '''Injun rollin'''')&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;Nieves, Evelyn. ''[http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2006/09/02/navajo In Navajo country, racism rides again.]'' salon.com 2 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lisa_d"&gt;Donaldson, Lisa Weber. ''"Indian rolling": White violence against Native Americans in Farmington, New Mexico.'' Dissertation (Publication 3220935). University of New Mexico, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; is the assault, and in some cases murder, of [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Apache people|Apache]], often of homeless individuals,&lt;ref&gt;Linthicum, Leslie. [http://www.abqjournal.com/upfront/19225059upfront07-19-09.htm ''Dirty Secrets Emerge After 'Indian Rolling'.''] Albuquerque Journal. 19 July 2009. Accessed 2011-03-26.&lt;/ref&gt; committed by non-Indians in the [[Southwestern United States]], particularly in the border towns surrounding the [[Navajo Nation]] and [[Jicarilla Apache|Jicarilla lands]].
In her 2006 dissertation, Lisa Donaldson classifies ''Indian rolling'' as a "thrill-seeking hate crime" and traces its roots to the colonization of the Southwest which created a "power differential between groups that led to negative feelings toward minorities among law enforcement and local citizens".&lt;ref name="lisa_d"/&gt;

The assaults, which often target alcoholic men who are comparatively defenseless, are variously described as representing  "rites of passage",&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt; "sport,"&lt;ref name="abjournal"&gt;Linthicum, Leslie. ''[http://www.abqjournal.com/paperboy/text/news/state/168931nm05-01-04.htm Farmington Struggles With Civil Rights Issues.]'' Albuquerque Journal. 1 May 2004. Accessed 2011-03-26.&lt;/ref&gt; and a "recreational pastime"&lt;ref name="lisa_d"/&gt; to the perpetrators. 
Survivors report the act involves being assaulted with rocks, [[pellet gun]]s, bottles, eggs, and baseball bats. Victims claim, furthermore, that law enforcement officials often refuse to intervene.&lt;ref name="homeless"&gt;Banish, Laura. ''Homeless: ‘Indian rolling’ still takes place today.'' The Daily Times. Farmington. 23 April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term first came to public notoriety in the spring of 1974 when three Navajos were beaten and murdered&lt;ref name="abjournal"/&gt; by white teenagers in the city of [[Farmington, New Mexico]], and their mutilated bodies were subsequently found in a nearby canyon.&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt; The perpetrators were not convicted of murder but were sent to a [[reform school]].  Protests by tribal members against this apparent injustice turned into riots when permits to march peacefully were revoked or not granted.&lt;ref name="pluralism"&gt;[http://pluralism.org/reports/view/68 Research Report: Navajo Community and Farmington, New Mexico (2006).] The Pluralism Project at Harvard University. Accessed 2011-03-26.&lt;/ref&gt; The incident triggered a report by the New Mexico Advisory Committee to the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] and inspired the [[true crime]]-novel ''The Broken Circle&amp;mdash;A True Story of Murder and Magic in Indian Country'' by Rodney Barker.&lt;ref name="homeless"/&gt;&lt;ref name="circle"&gt;Barker, Rodney. ''The Broken Circle&amp;mdash;A True Story of Murder and Magic in Indian Country.'' Simon &amp; Schuster. New York: 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns about the practice's revival emerged in the 1970s to 2000s after a resurgence of attacks against Native Americans in the area.&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="den_post"&gt;Draper, Electa. ''Attacks recall racist history of N.M. town.'' Denver Post. 13 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Assaults have allegedly taken place in [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Page, Arizona|Page]] and [[Gallup, New Mexico|Gallup]].&lt;ref name="dirty"&gt;Linthicum, Leslie.
