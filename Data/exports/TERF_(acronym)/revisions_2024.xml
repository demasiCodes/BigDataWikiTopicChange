'''TERF''' ({{IPAc-en|t|ɜːr|f}}) is an [[acronym]] for '''trans-exclusionary radical feminist'''. First recorded in 2008, the term TERF was originally used to distinguish [[transgender]]-inclusive [[feminists]] from a group of [[Radical feminism|radical feminists]] who reject the position that [[trans women]] are [[women]], reject the inclusion of trans women in [[women's spaces]], and oppose [[Transgender rights movement|transgender rights]] legislation. Trans-inclusive feminists assert that these ideas and positions are [[transphobic]] and [[Discrimination|discriminatory]] towards [[Transgender|transgender people]]. The use of the term TERF has since broadened to include reference to people with trans-exclusionary views who are not necessarily involved with [[radical feminism]].&lt;ref name="Stryker TSQ" /&gt;{{R|Lewis 2019|Miller 2018}} In the 2020s, the term "trans-exclusionary radical feminism" is used synonymously with or overlaps with "[[gender-critical feminism]]".

Though TERF was created to be a "deliberately technically neutral description", the term is now considered a [[pejorative]],&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Marshall |first=Alex |date=2024-08-08 |title=A Play About J.K.

Trans-inclusive radical feminist [[blog]]ger Viv Smythe has been credited with creating and popularizing the term&lt;ref name="Miller 2018"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theoutline.com/post/6536/british-feminists-media-transphobic |title=Why Is British Media So Transphobic? |last1=Miller |first1=Edie |date=5 November 2018 |publisher=[[The Outline (website)|The Outline]] |language=en |access-date=3 May 2019 |quote=The truth is, while the British conservative right would almost certainly be more than happy to whip up a frenzy of transphobia, they simply haven't needed to, because some sections of the left over here are doing their hate-peddling for them.

In the blog post, Smythe wrote that she rejected the alignment of all radical feminists with "trans-exclusionary radfem (TERF) activists".&lt;ref name="Smythe 2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smythe |first1=Viv |title=I'm credited with having coined the word 'Terf'.

== Usage == 
Smythe initially used TERF to refer to a particular type of feminist whom she characterized as "unwilling to recognise trans women as sisters". She also notes that the term has taken on additional connotations and that it has been "weaponised at times" by both inclusionary and exclusionary groups.&lt;ref name="Smythe 2018" /&gt; The term has since become an established part of the contemporary feminist language, but its usage is contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hines |first1=Sally |author-link=Sally Hines |title=The feminist frontier: on trans and feminism |journal=[[Journal of Gender Studies]] |date=17 February 2019 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=145–157 |doi=10.1080/09589236.2017.1411791 |s2cid=149145967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several writers have observed that TERF can be used in broader senses to refer to trans-exclusionary feminists who are not radical, people with a certain kind of trans-exclusionary politics regardless of whether they are radical feminists or even things that are culturally associated with [[second-wave feminism]] in general.&lt;ref name="Lewis 2019" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller 2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson 2018"&gt;{{cite web |website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |url=https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/08/lesbian-history-terfs-and-queer-culture-do-queer-women-have-to-reject-all-second-wave-feminism-to-be-inclusive.html |title=Do I Have to Give Up Lesbian History to Participate in Queer Culture? |last=Wilson |first=Lena |date=16 August 2018 |quote=TERF, as an insult, has become so far removed from its original activist intentions (rightly criticizing trans exclusion in feminism) that, at this point, it's also a word for anything that queer millennials deem uncool.

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED) added an entry for TERF (noun) in June 2022, which states that although the term was first intended as a neutral descriptor, it is "now typically regarded as derogatory".&lt;ref name="TerfOED"&gt;{{Cite OED|term=TERF|id=98002894|access-date=14 July 2022|date=June 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; OED editor Fiona McPherson explained that because "there is a little bit more nuance behind its usage{{snds}}it's not always just a straight-out insult", the dictionary's editors opted to explain this rather than simply label the term "derogatory" or "chiefly derogatory".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=22 June 2022 |title="Terf", "pangender" and "vaxxer" included in the OED new words list |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2022/06/oed-new-words-list-terf-pangender-vaxxer-included |access-date=15 July 2022 |magazine=[[New Statesman]] |language=en-US |archive-date=12 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220712001431/https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2022/06/oed-new-words-list-terf-pangender-vaxxer-included |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2023, the ''[[AP Stylebook]]'' advised journalists to avoid the term, deeming it "vague and politicized."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.advocate.com/media/associated-press-dont-say-terf|title=Don't Use 'TERF,' AP Stylebook Advises|website=www.advocate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her main criticism is that the term "trans-exclusionary radical feminist" is inaccurate, preferring the term "anti-trans activists" instead. Firstly because many people so-labelled are not at all radical feminists (citing [[J. K. Rowling]] as an example) and secondly that the term embeds the idea that radical feminists could work to "harm the interests of marginalized women".&lt;ref name="Saul 2020"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Saul |first=Jennifer |author-link=Jennifer Saul |date=5 March 2020 |title=Why the words we use matter when describing anti-trans activists |work=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |url=https://theconversation.com/why-the-words-we-use-matter-when-describing-anti-trans-activists-130990 |access-date=3 October 2021 |archive-date=9 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210909210036/https://theconversation.com/why-the-words-we-use-matter-when-describing-anti-trans-activists-130990 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist philosopher Talia Mae Bettcher argued that, regardless of whether the term was accurately classified as a slur, it "has at least become offensive to those designated by the term", which suggested it might be best to avoid "in case one wants to have a conversation across deep difference".&lt;ref name="Bettcher 2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bettcher |first1=Talia Mae |title=Trans Feminism: Recent Philosophical Developments. |journal=Philosophy Compass |date=November 2017 |volume=12 |issue=17 |page=7 |doi=10.1111/phc3.12438|quote=Part of the issue, however, concerns whether the expression continues to be used as a mere abbreviation for a description of a position (i.e., Trans-Exclusive Radical Feminist) as it was originally coined or whether it has also acquired a derogatory use.
