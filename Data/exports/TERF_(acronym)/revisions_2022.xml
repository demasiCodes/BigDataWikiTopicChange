'''TERF''' ({{IPAc-en|t|ɜːr|f}}) is an [[acronym]] for '''trans-exclusionary radical feminist'''. First recorded in 2008, the term was originally used to distinguish trans-inclusive [[feminists]] from a group of [[Radical feminism|radical feminists]] who reject the assertion that [[trans women]] are [[women]], the inclusion of trans women in [[women's spaces]], and [[transgender rights]] legislation. Trans-inclusive feminists assert that these ideas are [[transphobic]]. Use of the term TERF has since broadened to include reference to people with trans-exclusionary views who are not necessarily involved with [[radical feminism]].&lt;ref name="Stryker TSQ" /&gt;{{R|Lewis 2019|Miller 2018}}

Though it was created as a deliberately neutral descriptor, ''TERF'' is now typically considered [[derogatory]].{{R|TerfOED}} Those called TERFs often reject the label, and instead describe their beliefs as ''[[gender critical]]''.{{R|Vasquez 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1163/9789004506725_137 |chapter=Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminists (TERFs) |title=Encyclopedia of Queer Studies in Education |year=2021 |pages=695–698 |isbn=978-90-04-50672-5 |s2cid=246690677 |first1=Justin A. |last1=Gutzwa |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GCFeEAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA695 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In academic discourse, there is no consensus on whether ''TERF'' constitutes a slur. Critics of the word have pointed to its usage alongside insulting or abusive rhetoric, and described it as a "bullying tool",{{R|BennettBullies|Heuchan 2017|Allen et al.|Flaherty 2018}} while other academics have argued that this alone does not make the term a slur.{{R|Allen et al.|Flaherty 2018|McKinnon2018}}

==Origin==
Trans-inclusive [[cisgender]] radical feminist [[blogger]] Viv Smythe has been credited with popularizing the term&lt;ref name="Miller 2018"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theoutline.com/post/6536/british-feminists-media-transphobic |title=Why Is British Media So Transphobic? |last1=Miller |first1=Edie |date=5 November 2018 |publisher=[[The Outline (website)|The Outline]] |language=en |access-date=3 May 2019|quote=The truth is, while the British conservative right would almost certainly be more than happy to whip up a frenzy of transphobia, they simply haven't needed to, because some sections of the left over here are doing their hate-peddling for them.

Smythe has been credited with having coined the term ''TERF'', due to a blog post she wrote reacting to the [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]]'s [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival#"Womyn-born womyn" policy|policy]] of denying admittance to trans women. She wrote that she rejected the alignment of all radical feminists with "trans-exclusionary radfem (TERF) activists".&lt;ref name="Smythe 2018" /&gt; In a 2014 interview with ''The TransAdvocate'', Smythe said:

{{quote|It was meant to be a deliberately technically neutral description of an activist grouping. We wanted a way to distinguish TERFs from other RadFems with whom we engaged who were [[wikt:trans*|trans*]]-positive/neutral, because we had several years of history of engaging productively/substantively with non-TERF RadFems.&lt;ref name="Williams 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=Cristan |title=Radical Inclusion |journal=TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly |date=1 May 2016 |volume=3 |issue=1–2 |pages=254–258 |doi=10.1215/23289252-3334463 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Usage==
Smythe initially used ''TERF'' to refer to a particular type of feminist whom she characterized as "unwilling to recognise trans women as sisters" but notes that the term has taken on additional connotations and that it has been "weaponised at times" by both inclusionary and exclusionary groups.&lt;ref name="Smythe 2018" /&gt; The term has since become an established part of contemporary feminist language but its usage is contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hines |first1=Sally |author-link=Sally Hines |title=The feminist frontier: on trans and feminism |journal=Journal of Gender Studies |date=17 February 2019 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=145–157 |doi=10.1080/09589236.2017.1411791 |s2cid=149145967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several writers have observed that "TERF" can be used in broader senses to refer to trans-exclusionary feminists who are not radical, people with a certain kind of trans-exclusionary politics regardless of whether they are radical feminists, or even things that are culturally associated with [[second-wave feminism]] in general.&lt;ref name="Lewis 2019"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller 2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson 2018"&gt;{{cite web|website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|url=https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/08/lesbian-history-terfs-and-queer-culture-do-queer-women-have-to-reject-all-second-wave-feminism-to-be-inclusive.html|title=Do I Have to Give Up Lesbian History to Participate in Queer Culture?|last=Wilson|first=Lena|date=16 August 2018|quote=TERF, as an insult, has become so far removed from its original activist intentions (rightly criticizing trans exclusion in feminism) that, at this point, it's also a word for anything that queer millennials deem uncool. Things I've seen called "TERFy" on Twitter and Tumblr include tampon ads, the word "female," the non-word "womxn," Janelle Monae's "Pynk," the Venus symbol, bangs, Jill Stein, Cardi B, and&amp;nbsp;... trans women.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED) added an entry for ''TERF'' in June 2022, which states that although the term was first intended as a neutral descriptor, it is "now typically regarded as derogatory".&lt;ref name="TerfOED"&gt;{{Cite OED|term=TERF|id=98002894|access-date=14 July 2022|date=June 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; OED editor Fiona McPherson explained that because "there is a little bit more nuance behind its usage—it's not always just a straight-out insult", the dictionary's editors opted to explain this rather than simply label the term "derogatory" or "chiefly derogatory".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=22 June 2022 |title="Terf", "pangender" and "vaxxer" included in the OED new words list |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2022/06/oed-new-words-list-terf-pangender-vaxxer-included |access-date=15 July 2022 |website=New Statesman |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slur debate===
Those that have the word ''TERF'' directed at them often characterize it as a [[pejorative|slur]] or [[hate speech]].&lt;ref name="Vasquez 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Compton 2019"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Compton |first1=Julie |title='Pro-lesbian' or 'trans-exclusionary'?

The term can be useful for making a distinction with radical feminists who do not share the same position, but those at whom it is directed consider it a slur.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a July 2018 solicitation of essays regarding "transgender identities", British magazine ''[[The Economist]]'' required writers to "avoid all slurs, including TERF", stating that the word was used to try to silence opinions and sometimes incite violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Transgender identities: a series of invited essays |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=29 June 2018 |url=https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/06/29/transgender-identities-a-series-of-invited-essays |access-date=19 March 2019 |quote=In the interests of fostering open debate we have set ground rules, both for essays and reader comments: use the pronouns people want you to use, and avoid all slurs, including TERF (trans-exclusionary radical feminist), which may have started as a descriptive term but is now used to try to silence a vast swathe of opinions on trans issues, and sometimes to incite violence against women.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, seven British philosophers wrote on the website ''[[Daily Nous]]'' that two articles by [[Veronica Ivy]]&lt;ref name="McKinnon2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McKinnon |first1=Rachel |author-link=Veronica Ivy |title=The Epistemology of Propaganda |journal=[[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]] |date=7 March 2018 |volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=483–489 |doi=10.1111/phpr.12429 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/MCKTEO-19 |quote=many contemporary TERFs accuse trans women of coining the phrase/term—and, ludicrously, claim that 'TERF' is a misogynistic slur. ...

However, this is an absurd, nonsensical view of the nature of slurs.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jason Stanley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stanley |first1=Jason |author-link=Jason Stanley |title=Replies |journal=[[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]] |date=7 March 2018 |volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=497–511 |doi=10.1111/phpr.12427 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the journal ''[[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]]'' normalized the term. They described the term as "at worst a slur and at best derogatory", and argued that it had been used to denigrate those "who disagree with the dominant narrative on trans issues".&lt;ref name="Allen et al."&gt;{{cite document |last1=Allen |first1=Sophie R. |last2=Finneron-Burns |first2=Elizabeth |last3=Leng |first3=Mary |authorlink3=Mary Leng |last4=Lawford-Smith |first4=Holly |last5=Jones |first5=Jane Clare |last6=Reilly-Cooper |first6=Rebecca |last7=Simpson |first7=R.

[[Transgender rights]] activists generally but not always disagree that the term is a slur. Transgender author [[Andrea Long Chu]] described the claim that ''TERF'' was a slur as "a grievance that would be beneath contempt if it weren't also true, in the sense that all bywords for bigots are intended to be defamatory."&lt;ref name="Chu 2018"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Chu|first=Andrea Long |author-link=Andrea Long Chu|title=On Liking Women|magazine=[[n+1]]|url=https://nplusonemag.com/issue-30/essays/on-liking-women/|issue=30|date=Winter 2018|quote=They also don't much like the name TERF, which they take to be a slur—a grievance that would be beneath contempt if it weren't also true, in the sense that all bywords for bigots are intended to be defamatory.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists and philosophers of language have been skeptical of the idea that the term ''TERF'' is a slur. [[Transgender rights]] activist&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/46453958 |title=Transgender women in sport: Are they really a 'threat' to female sport? |last=Magowan |first=Alistair |date=18 December 2018 |work=BBC Sport |access-date=5 June 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[philosophy of language]] professor Veronica Ivy argues that just because the word could be used pejoratively, it did not mean it was a slur in general.&lt;ref name="McKinnon2018"/&gt; In a 2020 paper published in the philosophy journal ''[[Grazer Philosophische Studien]]'', linguists Christopher Davis and [[Elin McCready]] argued that three properties could make a term a slur: it had to be derogatory towards a particular group, used to subordinate them within some structure of power relations, and that the derogated group must be defined by an intrinsic property. Davis and McCready wrote that the term ''TERF'' satisfied the first condition, but failed the third condition, and that the second condition was contentious, in that it depended upon how each group saw itself in relation to the other group.&lt;ref name="Davis and McCready"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Instability of Slurs |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |date=4 March 2020 |last1=Davis |first1=Christopher |last2=McCready |first2=Elin |authorlink2=Elin McCready |journal = [[Grazer Philosophische Studien]] |volume=97 |pages=63–85 |doi=10.1163/18756735-09701005 |s2cid=216218536 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy of language professor [[Jennifer Saul]] disagreed with categorizing "TERF" as a slur, arguing that a term does not necessarily become a slur when coupled with violent or abusive rhetoric. However, she argued that the term is not accurate because not all people described as TERFs could reasonably be considered feminists, preferring the term "anti-trans activists" instead.&lt;ref name="Saul 2020"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Saul|first=Jennifer|author-link=Jennifer Saul|date=5 March 2020|title=Why the words we use matter when describing anti-trans activists|work=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]|url=https://theconversation.com/why-the-words-we-use-matter-when-describing-anti-trans-activists-130990|access-date=3 October 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other feminist philosophers have differing opinions on the term. Feminist philosopher Talia Mae Bettcher argued that, regardless of whether the term was accurately classified as a slur, it "has at least become offensive to those designated by the term", which suggested it might be best to avoid "in case one wants to have a conversation across deep difference".&lt;ref name="Bettcher 2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bettcher |first1=Talia Mae |title=Trans Feminism: Recent Philosophical Developments. |journal=Philosophy Compass |date=November 2017 |volume=12 |issue=17 |page=7 |doi=10.1111/phc3.12438|quote=Part of the issue, however, concerns whether the expression continues to be used as a mere abbreviation for a description of a position (i.e., Trans-Exclusive Radical Feminist) as it was originally coined or whether it has also acquired a derogatory use. The issues here are delicate ... it seems that caution should at least be deployed in case one wants to have a conversation across deep difference. This seems particularly important since much of trans politics is deeply committed to the importance of self-naming and respect for self-identities.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist philosopher [[Judith Butler]] disputed that the term "TERF" was a slur in an interview with ''[[New Statesman]]'', saying "I wonder what name self-declared feminists who wish to exclude trans women from women's spaces would be called? If they do favour exclusion, why not call them exclusionary? If they understand themselves as belonging to that strain of radical feminism that opposes gender reassignment, why not call them radical feminists?"&lt;ref name="Butler New Statesman"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.newstatesman.com/international/2020/09/judith-butler-culture-wars-jk-rowling-and-living-anti-intellectual-times | date=22 September 2020 | last=Ferber | first=Alona | title=Judith Butler on the culture wars, JK Rowling and living in 'anti-intellectual times'|work=[[New Statesman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2015 article, American feminist scholar [[Bonnie J.

My charge to every responsible editor, journalist, feminist scholar, and LGBT historian is to please stop recycling the acronym TERF; it is defamatory.}} [http://www.glreview.org/wp-content/uploads/DigitalEditions/mtdownload7894_2015.07.01_11.55/files/assets/common/downloads/page0013.pdf p. 13] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200507003514/https://www.glreview.org/wp-content/uploads/DigitalEditions/mtdownload7894_2015.07.01_11.55/files/assets/common/downloads/page0013.pdf |date=7 May 2020 }}, [http://www.glreview.org/wp-content/uploads/DigitalEditions/mtdownload7894_2015.07.01_11.55/files/assets/common/downloads/page0014.pdf p. 14] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200507045107/https://www.glreview.org/wp-content/uploads/DigitalEditions/mtdownload7894_2015.07.01_11.55/files/assets/common/downloads/page0014.pdf |date=7 May 2020 }}, [http://www.glreview.org/wp-content/uploads/DigitalEditions/mtdownload7894_2015.07.01_11.55/files/assets/common/downloads/page0015.pdf p. 15] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200507213322/https://www.glreview.org/wp-content/uploads/DigitalEditions/mtdownload7894_2015.07.01_11.55/files/assets/common/downloads/page0015.pdf |date=7 May 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2018, UK [[All-party parliamentary group|All Party Parliamentary Group]] (APPG) on Hate Crime received several submissions that indicated a high degree of tension between trans activists and feminist groups opposed to transgender rights legislation, with both sides detailing incidents of extreme or abusive language. The report noted that some women had submitted reports which argued that "women who object to the inclusion of trans women as female are being attacked both online and, in the street, with the term 'trans-exclusionary radical feminist' or (TERF) being used as a term of abuse."&lt;ref name=APPG2019&gt;{{cite web|author=All Party Parliamentary Group on Hate Crime|title=How Do We Build Community Cohesion When Hate Crime Is On The Rise?|url=http://www.appghatecrime.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/APPG%20on%20Hate%20Crime%20Report%20Hate%20Crime%20and%20Community%20Cohesion.pdf|publisher=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]]|date=2019|access-date=2 November 2019|pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people who have been called "trans-exclusionary radical feminists" say that "trans-exclusionary" is an inaccurate label, as they are inclusive of [[transgender men]], who have a female [[sex assignment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Flaherty |first1=Colleen |date=29 August 2018 |title='TERF' War – Philosophers object to a journal's publication 'TERF,' in reference to some feminists.
