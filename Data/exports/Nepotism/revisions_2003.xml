For instance, a manager in a firm is generally expected to promote the most competent persons, in order that the firm may succeed. For that manager to promote an incompetent relative over a more-qualified employee is nepotism.

The word ''nepotism'' comes from the Latin word for ''nephew''.

Some biologists have suggested that a tendency towards nepotism is instinctual, a form of [[kin selection]].

Nepotism is a common accusation in politics when the relative of a powerful figure ascends to similar power seemingly without appropriate qualifications. Politically powerful families such as the [[Kennedy family]] and [[Bush family]] in American politics are sometimes accused of nepotism by critics.
