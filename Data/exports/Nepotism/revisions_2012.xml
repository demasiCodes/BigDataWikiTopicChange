'''Nepotism''' is [[favoritism]] granted to [[relatives]] regardless of [[:wikt:merit|merit]].&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;Modern Language Association (MLA):"nepotism." The American Heritage New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy, Third Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2005. 10 Aug. 2009. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nepotism Dictionary.com].&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''nepotism'' is from the Latin word ''nepos'', ''nepotis'' (''m.'' "nephew"), from which modern Romanian ''[[wikt:nepot#Romanian|nepot]]'' and Italian ''[[wikt:nipote#Italian|nipote]]'' and Catalan ''[[wikt:nebot#Catalan|nebot]]'', "nephew" or "grandchild" are [[Cognate|also descended]].

==Origins==
{{Main|Cardinal-nephew}}
Nepotism gained its name after the church practice in the [[Middle Ages]], when some [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[pope]]s and [[bishop]]s, who had taken vows of [[chastity]], and therefore usually had no children of their own, gave their nephews such positions of preference as were often accorded by fathers to son.&lt;ref name="Article Nepotism"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Several popes [[Cardinal-nephew|elevated nephews]] and other relatives to the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinalate]]. Often, such appointments were a means of continuing a papal "dynasty".{{fact|date=June 2012}}

For instance, [[Pope Callixtus III]], head of the [[House of Borgia|Borgia]] family, made two of his nephews cardinals; one of them, Rodrigo, later used his position as a cardinal as a stepping stone to the papacy, becoming [[Pope Alexander VI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander then elevated Alessandro Farnese, his mistress's brother, to cardinal; Farnese would later go on to become [[Pope Paul III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul also engaged in nepotism, appointing, for instance, two nephews, aged 14 and 16, as cardinals. The practice was finally ended when [[Pope Innocent XII]] issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Romanum decet Pontificem]]'', in 1692.&lt;ref name="Article Nepotism"/&gt; The papal bull prohibited popes in all times from bestowing estates, offices, or revenues on any relative, with the exception that one qualified relative (at most) could be made a cardinal.{{fact|date=June 2012}}

Coincidentally, the [[Church of the East]] from the 16th to the 19th centuries made the Patriarch a hereditary title, being passed down from Patriarch-uncle to nephew; however, this move was initiated in the face of Timur's destruction of Nestorian Monasteries throughout Asia (monks being the key source of priests and patriarchs for the Church), in an attempt to guarantee the existence of a patriarch. This proved to be a catalyst for the schism that exists today between Chaldean Catholics and Assyrian "Nestorians".{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}
== Types of nepotism ==
=== Political ===
{{Refimprove|date=October 2009}}
Nepotism is a common accusation in politics when the relative of a powerful figure ascends to similar power seemingly without appropriate qualifications. The [[British English]] expression "[[Bob's your uncle]]" is thought to have originated when [[Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury]], promoted his nephew, [[Arthur Balfour]], to the esteemed post of [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]] in what was widely seen as an act of nepotism.&lt;ref name=Trahair&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=K0zrsHO27-wC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72 ''From Aristotelian to Reaganomics: A Dictionary of Eponyms With Biographies in the Social Science''], by R. C. S. Trahair, [[Greenwood Publishing Group]], 1994, page 72. Retrieved online from [[Google Books]], Jul 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anna Bligh]], who won the 2009 Queensland State election, has been accused of nepotism by giving her husband Greg Withers a position in the bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="houghton"&gt;Houghton, Des (2008-06-28).

==== Belgium ====
Over the past decade, criticism has been growing over the creation of political dynasties in Belgium, in which all of the traditional political parties have been involved. This phenomenon has been explained by the fact that prominent party members control the ranking of candidates on party lists for elections and a candidate's place on a list determines whether or not he or she is elected. Another justification for the phenomenon is the importance of name recognition for collecting votes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/buitenland/3376470/__Politiek_Belgie_is_familiezaak__.html?p=7,1 |title=Politiek België is familiezaak - Buitenland - Telegraaf.nl [24 uur actueel, ook mobiel&amp;#93; [buitenland&amp;#93; |publisher=Telegraaf.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Jacques De Gucht]], the son of former minister and current European Commissioner for Trade Policy [[Karel De Gucht]], was placed at the top of the electoral list for the Flemish Liberals in the 2007 federal elections for the East Flanders region and subsequently appointed to the Senate at age 27.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nieuws.be/nieuws/“Zonder_zijn_naam_had_Jean-Jacques_De_Gucht_nooit_op_de_lijst_gestaan”_29a8f63c.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freya Van den Bossche]], the daughter of  former minister [[Luc Van den Bossche]], a member of the Flemish socialists, was, at age 28, appointed the youngest minister in Belgian history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/europe/gender/story.html | work=Time | title=Can women enter the final bastion -- the all-male boardroom | date=2003-09-22 | accessdate=2010-05-20}} {{Dead link|date=September 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melchior Wathelet, Jr., the son of [[Melchior Wathelet|Melchior Wathelet, Sr.]] who was minister in several Belgian and Walloon governments and the mayor of Verviers, is currently the junior minister of budget, asylum and immigration, and family policy, and became, at age 26, the leader of the French-speaking Christian Democrat fraction in the Belgian parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://premier.fgov.be/minister/melchior-wathelet ]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruno Tobback]], the son of former minister and mayor of Leuven [[Louis Tobback]], a member of the Flemish socialists, became the Belgian federal government's minister for the environment at 34. In 2011, he succeeded Caroline Gennez as head of the Flemish socialist party, SPA.{{fact|date=June 2012}}

Mathias De Clerq is the grandson of former minister [[Willy De Clercq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Auteur: Karel Van Keymeulen |url=http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=9I1CG2BI |title=De Standaard Online - Willy De Clercq is zijn geheugen kwijt |publisher=Standaard.be |date= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre Sarkozy]], first son of then President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], asked [http://fr.wikipedia.org/SCPP SCPP] for a financial help in September 2009 of around €10000 towards an (€80000) artistic project. Because he was not a SCPP member, the request was automatically rejected.

=== In entertainment ===
Outside of national politics, accusations of "nepotism" are made in instances of ''[[prima facie]]'' favoritism to relatives, in such cases as:
* [[Peaches Geldof]]'s role as magazine editor in an [[MTV]] reality show - produced by a company owned by her father [[Bob Geldof]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/showbiz/showbiznews/2008/03/16/peaches-geldof-bags-tv-reality-show-as-magazine-editor-98487-20353319/ |title=Peaches Geldof bags TV reality show as magazine editor |publisher=Sundaymirror.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a sketch of ''[[The Kevin Bishop Show]]'', which frequently has less-than-flattering fake perfume adverts for celebrities, there was one for Peaches Geldof: "Nepotism, the smell of Peaches Geldof."

* Hollywood's [[Coppola family tree|The Coppola family]] includes many distinguished filmmakers and actors.

=== In business ===
One-time ''Guardian'' contributor Max Gogarty has also been accused of taking advantage of family connections to achieve success disproportionate to his ability; his father, Paul Gogarty, is a frequent travel writer for the newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/blog/2008/feb/14/skinsblog | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Max | last=Gogarty | title=Max, 19, hits the road | date=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference between nepotism and cronyism==
Nepotism differs from [[cronyism]] primarily as nepotism refers to partiality to family whereas cronyism refers to partiality to [[friend|friends]] or [[acquaintance|acquaintances]]. Forced cronyism may be due to political promises whereas nepotism under due recess is generally due to social pressure.
