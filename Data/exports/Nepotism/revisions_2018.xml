'''Nepotism''' is based on favour granted to [[Kinship|relatives]] in various fields, including business, politics, entertainment, sports, religion and other activities. The term originated with the assignment of nephews to important positions by [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[pope]]s and [[bishop]]s. [[Corruption in Lithuania#Nepotism|Trading parliamentary employment for favors]] is a modern-day example of nepotism. Criticism of nepotism, however, can be found in [[ancient India]]n texts such as the [[Tirukkural|Kural literature]].

== Origins ==

The term comes from the Italian word ''nepotismo'',&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nepotism "Nepotism."] Dictionary.com. Retrieved 20 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  |accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Middle Ages]] and until the late 17th century, some [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[pope]]s and [[bishop]]s, who had taken vows of [[chastity]], and therefore usually had no legitimate offspring of their own, gave their nephews such positions of preference as were often accorded by fathers to son.&lt;ref name="Article Nepotism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Article Nepotism |work=New Catholic Dictionary |url=http://catholic-forum.com/saints/ncd05726.htm |accessdate=12 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224025607/http://www.catholic-forum.com/Saints/ncd05726.htm |archivedate=24 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several popes [[Cardinal-nephew|elevated nephews]] and other relatives to the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinalate]]. Often, such appointments were a means of continuing a papal "dynasty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gianvittorio Signorotto|author2=Maria Antonietta Visceglia|title=Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492–1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2W1tc-wf5DQC&amp;pg=PA114|accessdate=20 June 2013|date=21 March 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43141-5|pages=114–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Pope Callixtus III]], head of the [[House of Borgia|Borgia]] family, made two of his nephews cardinals; one of them, Rodrigo, later used his position as a cardinal as a stepping stone to the papacy, becoming [[Pope Alexander VI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  |accessdate=12 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul III also engaged in nepotism, appointing, for instance, two nephews, aged 14 and 16, as cardinals. The practice was finally limited when [[Pope Innocent XII]] issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Romanum decet Pontificem]]'', in 1692.&lt;ref name="Article Nepotism" /&gt; The papal bull prohibited popes in all times from bestowing estates, offices, or revenues on any relative, with the exception that one qualified relative (at most) could be made a cardinal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anura Gurugé|title=The Next Pope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B5JVthemvvwC&amp;pg=PA115|accessdate=20 June 2013|date=16 February 2010|publisher=Anura Guruge|isbn=978-0-615-35372-2|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Ancient Indian philosophy|ancient Indian philosopher]] [[Valluvar]], nepotism is both evil and unwise.&lt;ref name="PSSundaram_Kural"&gt;{{cite book

== Types ==
=== Political ===
Nepotism is a common accusation in politics when the relative of a powerful figure ascends to similar power seemingly without appropriate qualifications. The [[British English]] expression "[[Bob's your uncle]]" is thought to have originated when [[Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury]], promoted his nephew, [[Arthur Balfour]], to the esteemed post of [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], which was widely seen as an act of nepotism.&lt;ref name=Trahair&gt;{{cite book

=== Organizational ===
Nepotism can also occur within organizations when a person is employed due to familial ties. It is generally seen as unethical, both on the part of the employer and employee.

==== In employment ====
Nepotism at work can mean increased opportunity at a job, attaining the job or being paid more than other similarly situated people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safeworkers.co.uk/nepotismatwork.html |title=Nepotism at Work |publisher=Safeworkers.co.uk |date=20 April 2013 |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments are made both for and against employment granted due to a family connection, which is most common in small, family run businesses. On one hand, nepotism can provide stability and continuity. Critics cite studies that demonstrate decreased morale and commitment from non-related employees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/contributors.asp?id=1625 |title=Family Ties: Handling Nepotism Within Your Business&amp;nbsp;– Perspectives&amp;nbsp;– Inside INdiana Business with Gerry Dick |publisher=Insideindianabusiness.com |date=9 November 2010 |accessdate=20 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514022519/http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/contributors.asp?id=1625 |archivedate=14 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and a generally negative attitude towards superior positions filled through nepotism. An article from ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine stated "there is no ladder to climb when the top rung is reserved for people with a certain name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/06/19/ceo-executive-hiring-ceonewtork-leadership-nepotism.html |title=Is Nepotism So Bad? |publisher=Forbes |date= |accessdate=20 June 2013 |first=Klaus |last=Kneale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some businesses forbid nepotism as an ethical matter, considering it too troublesome and disruptive.

==== In entertainment ====
Outside of national politics, accusations of nepotism are made in instances of ''[[prima facie]]'' favoritism to relatives, in such cases as:
* [[Peaches Geldof]]'s role as magazine editor in an [[MTV]] reality show&amp;nbsp;– produced by a company owned by her father, [[Bob Geldof]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/showbiz/showbiznews/2008/03/16/peaches-geldof-bags-tv-reality-show-as-magazine-editor-98487-20353319/ |title=Peaches Geldof bags TV reality show as magazine editor |work=[[Sunday Mirror]] |access-date=6 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524020700/http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/showbiz/showbiznews/2008/03/16/peaches-geldof-bags-tv-reality-show-as-magazine-editor-98487-20353319/ |archive-date=24 May 2008 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tori Spelling]]'s breakout role on [[Beverly Hills, 90210]] as a result of her father [[Aaron Spelling]]'s involvement with the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/30/arts/television/on-so-notorious-tori-spelling-mocks-herself-before-you-can.html|title=On 'So Notorious,' Tori Spelling Mocks Herself Before You Can|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/style/celebrity/celebrity-news/tori-spelling-admits-getting-shannon-doherty-fired-from-beverly-hills-90210-and-lending-her-dress-stained-with-virgin-blood-for-photoshoot-31580540.html|title=Tori Spelling admits getting Shannon Doherty fired from Beverly Hills 90210 and lending her dress stained with 'virgin blood' for photoshoot&amp;nbsp;– Independent.ie|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
* Hollywood's [[Coppola family tree|Coppola family]] includes many distinguished filmmakers and actors. The careers of [[Sofia Coppola]], [[Nicolas Cage]], and [[Jason Schwartzman]] have been attributed to aid by director [[Francis Ford Coppola]], who cast his daughter Sofia in ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/EXTRA_Nepotism_in_the_Directors_Chair/312221 |title=EXTRA: Nepotism in the Director's Chair at |publisher=Hollywood.com |date=21 April 2000 |accessdate=6 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006085336/http://www.hollywood.com/news/EXTRA_Nepotism_in_the_Directors_Chair/312221|archivedate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spiritof1976.livejournal.com/338603.html |title=Nothing is true, everything is permitted&amp;nbsp;– Coppola nepotism hate |publisher=Spiritof1976.livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cage changed his last name in order to distance himself from such charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/20/nicolas-cage-frozen-ground |title=Nicolas Cage: 'People think I'm not in on the joke' |last=Brockes |first=Emma |date=20 July 2013 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of partiality ==
Nepotism refers to partiality to family whereas [[cronyism]] refers to partiality to a partner or [[friend]].  [[In-group favoritism|Favoritism]], the broadest of the terms, refers to partiality based upon being part of a favored group, rather than job performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scu.edu/ethics/practicing/focusareas/government_ethics/introduction/cronyism.html | title=Favoritism, Cronyism, and Nepotism | publisher=Santa Clara University | accessdate=20 June 2013 | author=Judy Nadler and Miriam Schulman}}&lt;/ref&gt;
