'''Nepotism''' is the act of granting an [[In-group favoritism|advantage]], privilege, or position to [[Kinship|relatives]] or friends in an occupation or field - for instance business, politics, academia, entertainment, religion or [[health care]]. In concept it is similar to [[cronyism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |entry-url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/nepotism |entry=nepotism |dictionary=Cambridge Dictionary |access-date=23 July 2021 |title=NEPOTISM &amp;#124; meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary |archive-date=12 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112042128/https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/nepotism |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |entry-url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/nepotism |entry=nepotism | title=Dictionary.com |access-date=23 July 2021  |archive-date=16 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210516040552/https://www.dictionary.com/browse/nepotism |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term originated with the assignment of nephews, sons, or other relatives to important positions by Catholic popes and bishops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic-forum.com/Saints/ncd05726.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224025607/http://www.catholic-forum.com/Saints/ncd05726.htm |archive-date=24 February 2007 |website=New Catholic Dictionary |title=nepotism}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has often been witnessed in [[Autocracy|autocracies]], whereby [[Aristocracy|traditional aristocracies]] usually contested amongst themselves in order to obtain leverage, status, etc.

Nepotism has been criticized since [[ancient history]] by philosophers including [[Aristotle]], [[Thiruvalluvar|Valluvar]], and [[Confucius]], condemning it as both evil and unwise.&lt;ref name="PSSundaram_Kural"&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Middle Ages]] and until the late 17th century, some [[Catholicism|Catholic]] popes and bishops – who had taken vows of [[chastity]] and, therefore, usually had no legitimate offspring of their own – gave their nephews such positions of preference as were often accorded by fathers to sons.&lt;ref name="Article Nepotism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Article Nepotism |work=New Catholic Dictionary |url=http://catholic-forum.com/saints/ncd05726.htm |access-date=12 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224025607/http://www.catholic-forum.com/Saints/ncd05726.htm |archive-date=24 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They would also do the same with children who were the illegitimate result of broken celibacy vows, and who were claimed to be "nephews" instead of sons.&lt;ref name="Papal Crimes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Papal Crimes|work=Church and State|date=9 February 2024 |url=https://churchandstate.org.uk/2024/02/the-papal-crimes-that-reveal-medieval-vatican/|access-date=5 September 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several popes [[Cardinal-nephew|elevated nephews]] and other relatives to the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinalate]]. Often, such appointments were a means of continuing a papal "dynasty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gianvittorio Signorotto|author2=Maria Antonietta Visceglia|title=Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492–1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2W1tc-wf5DQC&amp;pg=PA114|access-date=20 June 2013|date=21 March 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43141-5|pages=114–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Pope Callixtus III]], head of the [[House of Borgia|Borgia]] family, made two of his nephews cardinals; one of them, Rodrigo, later used his position as a cardinal as a stepping stone to the papacy, becoming [[Pope Alexander VI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul III also engaged in nepotism, appointing, for instance, two nephews, aged 14 and 16, as cardinals. The practice was finally limited when [[Pope Innocent XII]] issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Romanum decet Pontificem]]'', in 1692.&lt;ref name="Article Nepotism" /&gt; The papal bull prohibited popes in all times from bestowing estates, offices, or revenues on any relative, with the exception that one qualified relative (at most) could be made a cardinal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anura Gurugé|title=The Next Pope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B5JVthemvvwC&amp;pg=PA115|access-date=20 June 2013|date=16 February 2010|publisher=Anura Guruge|isbn=978-0-615-35372-2|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mention in ancient literature===
In the [[Book of Porul|second book]] of the [[Tirukkural|Kural literature]], which forms a manual for governments and corporations, [[Valluvar]] suggests about nepotism and favouritism thus: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;If you choose an unfit person for your job just because you love and you like him, he will lead you to endless follies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/rediscovering-a-management-and-leadership-manual-in-ancient-indian-literature/ |title=Rediscovering a Management and Leadership Manual in Ancient Indian Literature – Knowledge@Wharton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=4 February 2023 |archive-date=17 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221117054622/https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/rediscovering-a-management-and-leadership-manual-in-ancient-indian-literature/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to him, nepotism is both evil and unwise.&lt;ref name="PSSundaram_Kural"/&gt;

== Types ==
=== Political ===
Nepotism is a common accusation in politics when the relative of a powerful figure ascends to similar power seemingly without appropriate qualifications. The [[British English]] expression "[[Bob's your uncle]]" is thought to have originated when [[Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury]], promoted his nephew, [[Arthur Balfour]], to the esteemed post of [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], which was widely seen as an act of nepotism.&lt;ref name=Trahair&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=K0zrsHO27-wC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72 ''From Aristotelian to Reaganomics: A Dictionary of Eponyms With Biographies in the Social Science''], by R. C. S. Trahair, [[Greenwood Publishing Group]], 1994, p. 72. Retrieved online from [[Google Books]], 30 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
[[Inheritance]] has been viewed by some as a form of nepotism.&lt;ref name="e543"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Pérez-González | first=Francisco | title=Inherited Control and Firm Performance | journal=American Economic Review | volume=96 | issue=5 | date=1 November 2006 | issn=0002-8282 | doi=10.1257/aer.96.5.1559 | pages=1559–1588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organizational ===
Nepotism in organizations leads to [[monopolization]] of power because when members involved in institutional [[decision-making]] are related, decisions made within institutions risk favoring a group of closely connected people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Teixeira da Silva |first1=Jaime A. |last2=Katavić |first2=Vedran |last3=Dobránszki |first3=Judit |last4=Al-Khatib |first4=Aceil |last5=Bornemann-Cimenti |first5=Helmar |date=2019 |title=Establishing Rules for Ethicists and Ethics Organizations in Academic Publishing to Avoid Conflicts of Interest, Favoritism, Cronyism and Nepotism |url=http://komejournal.com/files/KOME_MS_rulesethicists.pdf |journal=KOME |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=110–125 |doi=10.17646/KOME.75698.87 |s2cid=182521936 |access-date=4 February 2023 |archive-date=17 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221217020813/http://komejournal.com/files/KOME_MS_rulesethicists.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nepotism can also occur within organizations, when a person is employed due to their familial ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hotho|first1=Jasper|last2=Minbaeva|first2=Dana|last3=Muratbekova-Touron|first3=Maral|last4=Rabbiosi|first4=Larissa|date=1 September 2020|title=Coping with Favoritism in Recruitment and Selection: A Communal Perspective|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|language=en|volume=165|issue=4|pages=659–679|doi=10.1007/s10551-018-4094-9|issn=1573-0697|doi-access=free|hdl=10398/5ae2f89e-4e7b-4852-937b-909c79132a15|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally seen as unethical, both on the part of the employer and employee.&lt;ref&gt;"Richard Utz, "Beyond Consanguinity," ''[https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2010/03/24/beyond-consanguinity Inside Higher Ed] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221015131350/https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2010/03/24/beyond-consanguinity |date=15 October 2022 }}'', 24 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the consequences of nepotism in an organization is the creation of a limitation in the organization's network of contacts, reducing the opportunities for negotiation with other social circles, which can lead to a reduction in the success and duration of organizations in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The handbook of business and corruption: cross-sectoral experiences |date=2017 |editor=Michael S. Aßländer |editor2=Sarah Hudson |isbn=978-1-78635-445-7 |location=Bingley, UK |oclc=1003263368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In employment ====
Nepotism at work can mean increased opportunity at a job, attaining a job or being paid more than other similarly situated people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.safeworkers.co.uk/nepotismatwork.html |title=Nepotism at Work |publisher=Safeworkers.co.uk |date=20 April 2013 |access-date=20 June 2013 |archive-date=4 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404005247/http://www.safeworkers.co.uk/NepotismAtWork.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments are made both for and against employment granted due to a family connection, which is most common in small, [[family business|family run businesses]]. On one hand, nepotism can provide stability and continuity. Critics cite studies that demonstrate decreased morale and commitment from non-related employees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/contributors.asp?id=1625 |title=Family Ties: Handling Nepotism Within Your Business – Perspectives – Inside INdiana Business with Gerry Dick |publisher=Insideindianabusiness.com |date=9 November 2010 |access-date=20 June 2013 |archive-date=14 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514022519/http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/contributors.asp?id=1625 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a generally negative attitude towards superior positions filled through nepotism. An article from ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine stated "there is no ladder to climb when the top rung is reserved for people with a certain name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.forbes.com/2009/06/19/ceo-executive-hiring-ceonewtork-leadership-nepotism.html |title=Is Nepotism So Bad? |work=Forbes |access-date=20 June 2013 |first=Klaus |last=Kneale |archive-date=9 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191009125614/https://www.forbes.com/2009/06/19/ceo-executive-hiring-ceonewtork-leadership-nepotism.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Employing intimate people favors perpetuating the ideas or goals of those who employ them, knowing that the people around them will face up to them. However, it can lead to a lack of competent staff or a reduction in [[productivity]] because even if the employees are not the best options for their functions, they will be protected by those who employ them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Safina |first=Dinara |date=2015 |title=Favouritism and Nepotism in an Organization: Causes and Effects |journal=Procedia Economics and Finance |language=en |volume=23 |pages=630–634 |doi=10.1016/S2212-5671(15)00416-5 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some businesses forbid nepotism as an ethical matter, considering it too troublesome and disruptive. Most Companies' Codes of Conduct include severe disciplinary sanction for [[Conflicts of Interest]]. However, in Nepotistic practices, these are rarely observed or implemented. {{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

Nepotism is in academia where it is common for professors to have their partners, and sometimes children, hired by the same faculty in which they work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nepotism in the Academy Raises Serious Questions |url=https://www.diverseeducation.com/latest-news/article/15103475/nepotism-in-the-academy-raises-serious-questions |website=Diverse: Issues In Higher Education |access-date=15 August 2022 |language=en-us |date=19 October 2018 |archive-date=5 August 2022 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20220805222945/https://www.diverseeducation.com/latest-news/article/15103475/nepotism-in-the-academy-raises-serious-questions |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the 20th century, in the United States at least, this was far less frequent as universities typically held very strict anti-nepotism policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Past US Anti-nepotism Rules |url= https://history.nih.gov/display/history/Stadtman+Anti-Nepotism+Rules |website=Diverse: Issues In Higher Education | publisher= National Institutes of Health| place= US |access-date=15 September 2023 |archive-date=8 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230908065048/https://history.nih.gov/display/history/Stadtman+Anti-Nepotism+Rules |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Countries with high levels of corruption and higher education systems with low competition between universities are generally have higher levels of corruption in academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abramo |first1=Giovanni |last2=D'Angelo |first2=Ciriaco Andrea |last3=Rosati |first3=Francesco |title=Relatives in the same university faculty: nepotism or merit? |journal=Scientometrics |date=October 2014 |volume=101 |issue=1 |pages=737–749 |doi=10.1007/s11192-014-1273-z|arxiv=1810.13234 |s2cid=6285408 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy has been noted for having particularly high levels of nepotism in its academic system, when compared to other developed nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allesina |first1=Stefano |title=Measuring Nepotism through Shared Last Names: The Case of Italian Academia |journal=PLOS ONE |date=3 August 2011 |volume=6 |issue=8 |pages=e21160 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0021160|pmid=21826195 |pmc=3149595 |bibcode=2011PLoSO...621160A |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grilli |first1=Jacopo |last2=Allesina |first2=Stefano |title=Last name analysis of mobility, gender imbalance, and nepotism across academic systems |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=18 July 2017 |volume=114 |issue=29 |pages=7600–7605 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1703513114|pmid=28673985 |pmc=5530677 |bibcode=2017PNAS..114.7600G |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nepotism is often praised for favoring female employment in academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anti-nepotism policies and practices |date=31 December 1971 |url=https://www.academia.edu/47861504 |last1=Dunkle |first1=Margaret |access-date=15 September 2023 |archive-date=11 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240711041642/https://www.academia.edu/47861504 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selected examples by country ==
=== Argentina ===
In [[Argentina]], nepotism is a common practice. Although there have been various attempts at reducing it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://amp.dw.com/es/nepotismo-el-sue%C3%B1o-argentino/a-42374086 |title= AM – Nepotismo: el "sueño argentino" |work= Deutsche Welle |date= 30 January 2018 |access-date= 20 April 2021 |archive-date= 20 April 2021 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210420154722/https://amp.dw.com/es/nepotismo-el-sue%C3%B1o-argentino/a-42374086 |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is difficult in a country where state jobs are used as a token of gratitude or party favoritism.

Former president [[Mauricio Macri]] has been investigated for nepotism after allegedly extending a tax amnesty to his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/argentine-president-probed-nepotism-tax-amnesty-201053073.html|title=Argentine president probed for nepotism in tax amnesty|publisher=Yahoo News|date=13 December 2006|access-date=12 October 2021|archive-date=27 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211027181525/https://news.yahoo.com/argentine-president-probed-nepotism-tax-amnesty-201053073.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nonetheless, in 2018, the government of Mauricio Macri set a limit on nepotism through Decree 93/2018&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://servicios.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/305000-309999/306423/norma.htm|title=Decreto 93/2018.

The spouse and the Cohabitant Union are included. "

The [[Kirchnerist]] movement has been openly accused that it believes in nepotism, treating meritocracy as a pejorative concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Martin |first1=Nicholas |title=Argentina moves to stamp out nepotism |url=https://www.dw.com/en/argentinas-mauricio-macri-targets-nepotism-in-fight-against-corruption/a-42408286 |access-date=5 September 2024 |publisher=DW |date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Soltys |first1=Michael |title=All in the family |url=https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/opinion-and-analysis/all-in-the-family.phtml |access-date=5 September 2024 |publisher=Buenos Aires Times |date=22 June 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government's ministries and secretariats are reportedly plagued with friends, family and supporters of the current party leaders, many of whom have been criticized for being incompetent at their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clarin.com/politica/polemicas-designaciones-gobierno-alberto-fernandez-siguen-aumento_0_vlFxQlFA.amp.html |title= Denuncias de nepotismo y falta de experiencia para ocupar cargos públicos |publisher= Clarin |date= 25 January 2020 |access-date= 20 April 2021 |archive-date= 20 April 2021 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210420154722/https://www.clarin.com/politica/polemicas-designaciones-gobierno-alberto-fernandez-siguen-aumento_0_vlFxQlFA.amp.html |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 10, 2023, the libertarian president [[Javier Milei]] takes office - who campaigned criticizing the political "caste", an entelechy built to denigrate traditional political parties and among whose characteristics is that of appointing friends and family to public positions on a discretionary basis - and in one of his first measures he modifies the Mauricio Macri's Decree 93/2018 to be able to grant his sister, [[Karina Milei]], the position of General Secretary of the Presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ambito.com/politica/javier-milei-modifico-un-decreto-mauricio-macri-que-impedia-nombrar-familiares-cargos-publicos-n5896057|title=Para que pueda asumir su hermana Karina, Javier Milei modificó un decreto de Mauricio Macri que impedía nombrar familiares en cargos públicos|publisher=ambito.com|date=1 February 2024|access-date=2 February 2024|archive-date=2 February 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240202130902/https://www.ambito.com/politica/javier-milei-modifico-un-decreto-mauricio-macri-que-impedia-nombrar-familiares-cargos-publicos-n5896057|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than two months later, Francisco Adorni, the brother of the government spokesperson [[Manuel Adorni]], took a position as an advisor in the Ministry of Defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clarin.com/politica/nombraron-asesor-defensa-hermano-vocero-presidencial-cobrara-millones-pesos-mes_0_gyqdrpAtOC.html|title=Nombraron como asesor en Defensa al hermano del vocero presidencial: cobraría más de dos millones de pesos por mes|publisher=ambito.com|date=1 February 2024|access-date=2 February 2024|archive-date=11 July 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240711041642/https://www.clarin.com/politica/nombraron-asesor-defensa-hermano-vocero-presidencial-cobrara-millones-pesos-mes_0_gyqdrpAtOC.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
Shortly after his appointment as the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney in 2001, [[Peter Jensen (bishop)|Peter Jensen]] was accused, in an Australian Broadcasting Corporation interview, of nepotism after nominating his brother [[Phillip Jensen]] as Dean of Sydney and appointing his wife Christine Jensen to an official position in the Sydney diocese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=18 November 2002 |title=AM – Archbishop Jensen accused of nepotism |url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/stories/s728866.htm |access-date=22 June 2012 |work=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |archive-date=18 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218073022/http://www.abc.net.au/am/stories/s728866.htm |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anna Bligh]], who won the 2009 Queensland State election, has been accused of nepotism by giving her husband Greg Withers a position as the Office of Climate Change head.&lt;ref name="houghton"&gt;Houghton, Des (28 June 2008).

[[Football Federation Australia]] was led by [[Frank Lowy]] from its inception in 2004 until his [[term limit]] exit in 2015. His son, [[Steven Lowy]], who had little direct involvement in high level sports governance was nominated as his replacement by Frank, and was elected unopposed by a board strongly loyal to Frank. Steven's introduction exacerbated existing governance issues, with factional opposition led by [[City Football Group]] causing [[FIFA]] intervention to be threatened. Eventually governance reforms were forced through despite opposition from the Lowy family, and it ended with Steven Lowy resigning from the role. Lowy had also been accused of nepotism regarding his sons in his corporate dealings as founder of [[Westfield Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/frank-lowys-successor-at-ffa-likely-to-be-his-son-20141218-12a3qk.html | title=Frank Lowy's successor at FFA likely to be his son | date=19 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.afr.com/companies/corporate-nepotism-19970411-k7eak | title=Corporate nepotism | date=11 April 1997 | access-date=2 November 2023 | archive-date=2 November 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231102103708/https://www.afr.com/companies/corporate-nepotism-19970411-k7eak | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 February 2017, [[President of Azerbaijan]] [[Ilham Aliyev]] created the position of [[Vice President of Azerbaijan]], then appointed his wife [[Mehriban Aliyeva]] to the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meeting of Security Council held under chairmanship of President Ilham Aliyev VIDEO|url=http://azertag.az/en/xeber/1037089|access-date=11 March 2017|agency=Azertag|date=21 February 2017|language=en|archive-date=27 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227044801/http://azertag.az/en/xeber/1037089|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1993, the presidency of Azerbaijan has always been in the hands of a member of the Aliyev family: in 1993, [[Heydar Aliyev]] was elected president of Azerbaijan, and after his death in a United States hospital in 2003, his son Ilham Aliyev became president and has been since then.

=== Belgium ===
Over the past decade, criticism has been growing over the creation of political dynasties in Belgium. This phenomenon has been explained by the fact that prominent party members control the ranking of candidates on party lists for elections and a candidate's place on a list determines who is elected. Another justification for the phenomenon is the importance of name recognition for collecting votes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/buitenland/3376470/__Politiek_Belgie_is_familiezaak__.html?p=7,1 |title=Politiek België is familiezaak – Buitenland – Telegraaf.nl [24 uur actueel, ook mobiel&amp;#93; [buitenland&amp;#93; |publisher=Telegraaf.nl |access-date=6 March 2011 |archive-date=8 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608050210/http://www.telegraaf.nl/buitenland/3376470/__Politiek_Belgie_is_familiezaak__.html?p=7,1 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims of nepotism have been made against [[Bruno Tobback]], the son of senator and former minister [[Louis Tobback]], a member of the Flemish socialists, became the Belgian federal government's minister for the pensions and environment at 35 in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ipe.com/magazine/tobback-making-his-mark_17630.php#.UcPF2ZzgUoI | archive-url=https://archive.today/20130624202437/http://www.ipe.com/magazine/tobback-making-his-mark_17630.php%23.UcPF2ZzgUoI | url-status=dead | archive-date=24 June 2013 | title=Tobback: making his mark | publisher=IPE International Publishers Limited | work=Investment &amp; Pensions Europe | date=1 March 2005 | access-date=20 June 2013 | author=Martin Hurst }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander De Croo]], the son of former speaker of the Belgian parliament Herman De Croo, ran for the leadership of his father's party Open VLD at age 33.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gva.be/nieuws/binnenland/aid874229/alexander-de-croo-wil-voorzitter-open-vld-worden.aspx?cmt=all |title=Alexander De Croo wil voorzitter Open Vld worden |date=27 October 2009 |publisher=Gva.be |access-date=6 March 2011 |archive-date=11 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511132817/http://www.gva.be/nieuws/binnenland/aid874229/alexander-de-croo-wil-voorzitter-open-vld-worden.aspx?cmt=all |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally there is the example of [[Maya Detiège]], the daughter of former mayor of the city of [[Antwerp]] Leona Detiège, who herself is the daughter of the former mayor of [[Antwerp]] Frans Detiège.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
Among other examples are former minister [[Freya Van den Bossche|Freya Van Den Bossche]] and senator [[Jean-Jacques De Gucht]], being the daughter and son of respectively former minister [[Luc Van den Bossche|Luc Vandenbossche]] and former minister [[Karel De Gucht]].

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, nepotism heavily affects the integrity of public institutions, including [[Tribunal de Contas da União|audit bodies]] responsible for overseeing executive decisions. Studies indicate that around 30% of audit judges are directly related to other politicians, creating a network of familial ties that can lead to conflicts of interest and reduce the effectiveness of independent oversight (Transparency International, 2023).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2024-01-30 |title=Brazil |url=https://www.transparency.org/en/countries/brazil |access-date=2024-10-29 |website=Transparency.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This high rate of nepotism often results in biased audit outcomes, eroding public trust and obstructing fair governance. The presence of such familial networks within regulatory bodies not only compromises transparency but also perpetuates inefficiency and corruption, limiting reform efforts across Brazil’s political landscape (Instituto Não Aceito Corrupção, 2022).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Inac {{!}} Instituto Não Aceito Corrupção {{!}} São Paulo |url=https://www.naoaceitocorrupcao.org.br/ |access-date=2024-10-29 |website=INAC |language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cambodia ===
[[Prime Minister of Cambodia|Prime Minister]] [[Hun Sen]] and senior members of [[Parliament of Cambodia|Parliament]] are known for their hand in getting family members into government positions. In the [[2013 Cambodian general election|2013 Cambodian parliamentary elections]], at least eight candidates were sons of high-ranking [[Cambodian People's Party]] officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/2013050665421/National/sons-of-the-party-anointed.html |title=Sons of the party anointed |publisher=Meas Sokchea |date=6 May 2013 |access-date=6 May 2013 |archive-date=3 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603215514/http://www.phnompenhpost.com/2013050665421/National/sons-of-the-party-anointed.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; All sons of the ruling party lost but were eventually appointed into high-ranking government positions.

For the past 3,000 years, nepotism has been common in China's clan and extended family-based culture. [[Confucius]] wrote about the importance of balancing "filial piety with merit". The [[clan]]-based [[feudal society|feudal system]] collapsed during Confucius' lifetime, yet nepotism has continued through the modern age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1548234/high-level-officials-monopolise-party-promotion-mechanism-study-finds|title=High-level officials monopolise party promotion mechanism, study finds|date=6 July 2014|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=4 February 2023|archive-date=10 July 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220710113519/https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1548234/high-level-officials-monopolise-party-promotion-mechanism-study-finds|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Bellow|title=In Praise of Nepotism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z8wSCZG9O6AC&amp;pg=PA89|access-date=21 June 2013|date=13 July 2004|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4000-7902-5|pages=89–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Nepotism in Indian politics}}
Since the 1980s, Indian politics has become dynastic, possibly due to the absence of elected party organization, independent civil society associations that mobilize support for a party, and centralized financing of elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1= Chhibber|first1=Pradeep|title=Dynastic parties Organization, finance and impact| journal=Party Politics |date=March 2013|volume=19|issue=2|pages=277–295 |doi= 10.1177/1354068811406995|s2cid=144781444}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of dynastic politics has been the [[Nehru–Gandhi family]] which produced [[List of prime ministers of India|three]] Indian prime ministers.

===Indonesia===
[[Suharto]], Indonesia's second president, is involved in nepotism, alongside corruption and [[collusion]] (together, they are known as the ''KKN'' in {{langx|id|korupsi, kolusi, dan nepotisme}}). Companies belonging to Suharto's children, particularly Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana ("Tutut"), Hutomo Mandala Putra ("Tommy"), and Bambang Trihatmodjo, were given lucrative government contracts and protected from market competition by monopolies. Examples include the toll-expressway company [[:id:Jasamarga|Jasamarga]] (monopolized by Tutut), the national car project [[Timor]] (monopolized by Bambang and Tommy), and the cinema market (monopolized by [[:id:21 Cineplex|21 Cineplex]], which is owned by Suharto's cousin Sudwikatmono). The family is said to control about {{Cvt|36000|km2}} of real estate in Indonesia, including {{Cvt|100000|m2}} of prime office space in Jakarta and nearly 40% of the land in [[East Timor]]. Additionally, Suharto's family members received free shares in 1,251 of Indonesia's most lucrative domestic companies (mostly run by Suharto's ethnic-Chinese cronies), while foreign-owned companies were encouraged to establish "strategic partnerships" with the former Indonesian president's family companies.&lt;ref name="BBC_20040325"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3567745.stm | title=Suharto tops corruption rankings | work=BBC News | date=25 March 2004 | access-date=4 February 2006 | archive-date=13 November 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201113042444/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3567745.stm | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Global Corruption Report"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transparency.org/content/download/4459/26786/file/Introduction_to_political_corruption.pdf |title=Global Corruption Report |publisher=Transparency International |access-date=6 August 2009 |archive-date=4 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704093500/http://www.transparency.org/content/download/4459/26786/file/Introduction_to_political_corruption.pdf |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Corruption in Mauritius}}
Nepotism is common in [[Politics of Mauritius|Mauritian politics]], with many relatives and friends of high-ranking politicians being appointed high-ranking positions and associated companies being granted government contracts.

Since the [[1948 Mauritian general election|first democratic elections in 1948]], the field of politics in Mauritius has been marked by a handful of families who have controlled the four major political parties which exist to this day. They are often referred to as the "modern dynasties" of Mauritian politics such as the Duval, Bérenger, Curé, Uteem, Mohamed, Boolell, Ramgoolam and Jugnauth families. The Boolell family's involvement in politics started with [[Satcam Boolell]] in 1955, paving the way for his son [[Arvin Boolell]], nephews Satish Boolell, Anil Gayan, and Sanjay Bhuckory, and son-in-law Sushil Kushiram to enter politics.
