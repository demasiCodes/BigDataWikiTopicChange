'''Nepotism''' is [[favoritism]] granted in politics or business to [[Kinship|relatives]]. The term originated with the assignment of nephews to cardinal positions by [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[pope]]s and [[bishop]]s. Nepotism is found in the fields of politics, entertainment, business and religion.

&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Middle Ages]] and until the late 17th century, some [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[pope]]s and [[bishop]]s, who had taken vows of [[chastity]], and therefore usually had no legitimate offspring of their own, gave their nephews such positions of preference as were often accorded by fathers to son.&lt;ref name="Article Nepotism"&gt;{{cite web

Several popes [[Cardinal-nephew|elevated nephews]] and other relatives to the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinalate]]. Often, such appointments were a means of continuing a papal "dynasty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gianvittorio Signorotto|author2=Maria Antonietta Visceglia|title=Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2W1tc-wf5DQC&amp;pg=PA114|accessdate=20 June 2013|date=21 March 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43141-5|pages=114–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Pope Callixtus III]], head of the [[House of Borgia|Borgia]] family, made two of his nephews cardinals; one of them, Rodrigo, later used his position as a cardinal as a stepping stone to the papacy, becoming [[Pope Alexander VI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Paul also engaged in nepotism, appointing, for instance, two nephews, aged 14 and 16, as cardinals. The practice was finally ended when [[Pope Innocent XII]] issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Romanum decet Pontificem]]'', in 1692.&lt;ref name="Article Nepotism"/&gt; The papal bull prohibited popes in all times from bestowing estates, offices, or revenues on any relative, with the exception that one qualified relative (at most) could be made a cardinal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anura Gurugé|title=The Next Pope|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=B5JVthemvvwC&amp;pg=PA115|accessdate=20 June 2013|date=16 February 2010|publisher=Anura Guruge|isbn=978-0-615-35372-2|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of nepotism ==

=== Political ===
Nepotism is a common accusation in politics when the relative of a powerful figure ascends to similar power seemingly without appropriate qualifications. The [[British English]] expression "[[Bob's your uncle]]" is thought to have originated when [[Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury]], promoted his nephew, [[Arthur Balfour]], to the esteemed post of [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], which was widely seen as an act of nepotism.&lt;ref name=Trahair&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=K0zrsHO27-wC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72 ''From Aristotelian to Reaganomics: A Dictionary of Eponyms With Biographies in the Social Science''], by R. C. S. Trahair, [[Greenwood Publishing Group]], 1994, page 72. Retrieved online from [[Google Books]], Jul 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organizational ===
Nepotism can also occur within organizations, when a person is employed due to their familial ties. It is generally seen as unethical, both on the part of the employer and employee. 

===By Country===
==== Australia ====
[[Anna Bligh]], who won the 2009 Queensland State election, has been accused of nepotism by giving her husband Greg Withers a position as the Office of Climate Change head.&lt;ref name="houghton"&gt;Houghton, Des (2008-06-28).

Shortly after his appointment as the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney in 2001, [[Peter Jensen (bishop)|Peter Jensen]] was accused, in an Australian Broadcasting Corporation interview, of nepotism after nominating his brother [[Phillip Jensen]] as Dean of Sydney and appointing his wife Christine Jensen to an official position in the Sydney diocese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/stories/s728866.htm |title=AM - Archbishop Jensen accused of nepotism |work=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2002-11-18 |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Belgium ====
Over the past decade, criticism has been growing over the creation of political dynasties in Belgium, in which all of the traditional political parties have been involved. This phenomenon has been explained by the fact that prominent party members control the ranking of candidates on party lists for elections and a candidate's place on a list determines whether or not he or she is elected. Another justification for the phenomenon is the importance of name recognition for collecting votes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/buitenland/3376470/__Politiek_Belgie_is_familiezaak__.html?p=7,1 |title=Politiek België is familiezaak - Buitenland - Telegraaf.nl [24 uur actueel, ook mobiel&amp;#93; [buitenland&amp;#93; |publisher=Telegraaf.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims of nepotism have been made against [[Bruno Tobback]], the son of senator and former minister [[Louis Tobback]], a member of the Flemish socialists, became the Belgian federal government's minister for the pensions and environment at 35 in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ipe.com/magazine/tobback-making-his-mark_17630.php#.UcPF2ZzgUoI | title=Tobback: making his mark | publisher=IPE International Publishers Limited | work=Investment &amp; Pensions Europe | date=1 Mar 2005 | accessdate=20 June 2013 | author=Martin Hurst}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alexander De Croo]], the son of former speaker of the Belgian parliament Herman De Croo, ran for the leadership of his father's party Open VLD at age 33.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gva.be/nieuws/binnenland/aid874229/alexander-de-croo-wil-voorzitter-open-vld-worden.aspx?cmt=all |title=Alexander De Croo wil voorzitter Open Vld worden |publisher=Gva.be |date= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally there is the example of [[Maya Detiège]], the daughter of former mayor of the city of [[Antwerp]] Leona Detiège, who herself is the daughter of the former mayor of [[Antwerp]] Frans Detiège.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==== Cambodia ====
Prime Minister [[Hun Sen]] and senior members of [[Parliament of Cambodia|Parliament]], are also known for their hand in getting family members into government positions. In the [[Cambodian parliamentary election, 2013|2013 Cambodian parliamentary elections]], at least eight candidates standing in the upcoming July election are sons of high-ranking [[Cambodian People’s Party]] officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/2013050665421/National/sons-of-the-party-anointed.html |title=Sons of the party anointed |publisher= Meas Sokchea |date=2013-05-06 |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; All ruling party sons lost, but were appointed into high government positions.

==== China ====
For the past 3,000 years, nepotism has been common in China's clan and extended family based culture. Confucius wrote about the importance of balancing "filial piety with merit". The [[clan]]-based [[feudal society|feudal system]] collapsed during [[Confucius]]' lifetime, yet nepotism has continued through the modern age.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1548234/high-level-officials-monopolise-party-promotion-mechanism-study-finds&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Bellow|title=In Praise of Nepotism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=z8wSCZG9O6AC&amp;pg=PA89|accessdate=21 June 2013|date=13 July 2004|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4000-7902-5|pages=89–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[:zh:张辉|Zhang Hui]], was believed to have his career "expedited" through the intervention of his uncle, [[Li Jianguo]], Vice Chairman and Secretary General of the [[National People’s Congress]]. Hui was made the youngest member and secretary of Jining's Municipal Standing Committee at the age of 32.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/china-news/politburo-member-accused-of-nepotism-325972.html | title=Chinese Politburo Member Accused of Nepotism | work=The Epoch Times | date=18 December 2012 | accessdate=21 June 2013 | author=Fang Xiao}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because he was not a SCPP member, the request was automatically rejected. Sarkozy then went to the [[Élysée]] which lead to an Élysée counsel contacting the SCPP, and SCPP president [[Marc Guez]] assuring the issue would soon be favorably resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electronlibre.info/+Nepotisme-et-Sarkozysme-acte-II,02317+ |title=Népotisme et Sarkozysme, acte II (màj) |publisher=Electronlibre.info |date= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rue89.com/2009/11/07/apres-jean-un-coup-de-pouce-de-lelysee-pour-pierre-sarkozy-125100 |title=Après Jean, un coup de pouce de l'Elysée pour Pierre Sarkozy |publisher=Rue89.com |date=2011-01-19 |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[:fr:Abeille Musique|Abeille Music]] president and SCPP member Yves Riesel, however, this would not happen as SCPP's financial help has been restricted to members only for months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/politiques/0101601841-apres-jean-l-elysee-se-met-au-service-de-pierre-sarkozy |title=Après Jean, l'Elysée se met au service de Pierre Sarkozy |publisher=Liberation.fr |date= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== India ====
Corruption goes hand in hand with nepotism in India. It goes on in government and private jobs both. Nepotism is common in politics and in the movie industry. It goes on even in religious circles, arts, industry, and other types of organizations. Many members of parliament and the Legislative Assembly have a generations-long legacy of nepotic allocation of constituencies to their relatives.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The Khan families, Kapoor families, the Bachan family,{{Clarify|date=April 2014}} and many other Indian movie actors have brought their children into the movie industry with their endorsements. Moreover, dynasty in politics remains. [[Rahul Gandhi]], Vice-President of the [[Indian National Congress]] party, is a descendent of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Indira Gandhi]] &amp; [[Rajiv Gandhi]], and . Cricket is also affected with nepotism in the form of Stuart Binny and Rohan Gavaskar. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/12/world/asia/12iht-letter12.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/comment/nepotism-the-way-they-do-politics-in-india-20140327-zqnpg.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pakistan ====
Nepotism has a long history in Indian subcontinent, including [[Pakistan]], where it has been the cause of much [[controversy]]. The [[Bhutto_family|Bhutto Family]] have long been targets of allegations of nepotism. [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]], a [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]] was executed by [[General Zia-ul-Haq]]. After ten years of dictatorship under Zia, Pakistan returned to democracy under Bhutto's daughter, [[Benazir Bhutto]]. After her assassination, her husband [[Asif Ali Zardari]] took the office of prime minister. Their son [[Bilawal Bhutto Zardari]] is also an active politician and a possible future candidate for prime minister. As of August 2014, [[politicians]] [[Imran Khan]] and Dr. Tahirul Qadri are leading mass rallies calling for the end of "monarchy" in Pakistan, triggered by the fact that the [[Prime Minister]] [[Nawaz Sharif]] is the brother of the [[Chief Minister]] [[Shahbaz Sharif]] of Pakistan's largest province [[Punjab]].
Nepotism is at peak with current Prime Ministry having more than 20 family members in government and higher post. Moreover after family the 2nd best options for Nawaz Sharif is to go with his caste.

President [[Robert Mugabe]] is reported to be preparing his wife [[Grace Mugabe]] to be the next president of Zimbabwe once he steps down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Thornycroft | first=Peta  |last2=Blair |first2=David | title=Mugabe accused of 'bedroom coup' as he prepares his wife for presidency | publisher=The Telegraph | date=31 October 2014 | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/zimbabwe/11201716/Mugabe-accused-of-bedroom-coup-as-he-prepares-his-wife-for-presidency.html | format=Web | accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vice President [[Joice Mujuru]] was previously considered to be the favored successor to Mugabe. It is thus fair to say Grace Mugabe is taking advantage of her husbands political position which can therefore be termed as 'the birth of nepotism in Zimbabwean politics.&lt;ref&gt;JR ASAP BEATZ,ASAP PRESS&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In entertainment ===
Outside of national politics, accusations of "nepotism" are made in instances of ''[[prima facie]]'' favoritism to relatives, in such cases as:
* [[Peaches Geldof]]'s role as magazine editor in an [[MTV]] reality show – produced by a company owned by her father [[Bob Geldof]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/showbiz/showbiznews/2008/03/16/peaches-geldof-bags-tv-reality-show-as-magazine-editor-98487-20353319/ |title=Peaches Geldof bags TV reality show as magazine editor |publisher=Sundaymirror.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}{{dead link|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hollywood's [[Coppola family tree|Coppola family]] includes many distinguished filmmakers and actors. The careers of [[Sofia Coppola]], [[Nicolas Cage]], and [[Jason Schwartzman]] have been attributed to aid by director [[Francis Ford Coppola]], who cast his daughter Sofia in ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/EXTRA_Nepotism_in_the_Directors_Chair/312221 |title=EXTRA: Nepotism in the Director's Chair at |publisher=Hollywood.com |date=2000-04-21 |accessdate=2011-03-06|archiveurl=http://archive.is/H7YpF|archivedate=2013-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spiritof1976.livejournal.com/338603.html |title=Nothing is true, everything is permitted - Coppola nepotism hate |publisher=Spiritof1976.livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cage changed his last name in order to distance himself from such charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115/bio Nicolas Cage - imdb biography&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The main cast for the [[HBO]] series ''[[Girls (TV series)|Girls]]'' is made up entirely of daughters from notable figures in entertainment, such as [[Brian Williams]] and [[David Mamet]].

=== In employment ===
Nepotism at work can mean increased opportunity at a job, attaining the job or being paid more than other similarly situated people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safeworkers.co.uk/nepotismatwork.html |title=Nepotism at Work |publisher=Safeworkers.co.uk |date=2013-04-20 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments are made both for and against employment granted due to a family connection, which is most common in small, family run businesses. On one hand, nepotism can provide stability and continuity. Critics cite studies that demonstrate decreased morale and commitment from non-related employees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/contributors.asp?id=1625 |title=Family Ties: Handling Nepotism Within Your Business - Perspectives - Inside INdiana Business with Gerry Dick |publisher=Insideindianabusiness.com |date=2010-11-09 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and a generally negative attitude towards superior positions filled through nepotism. An article from ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine stated "there is no ladder to climb when the top rung is reserved for people with a certain name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2009/06/19/ceo-executive-hiring-ceonewtork-leadership-nepotism.html |title=Is Nepotism So Bad? |publisher=Forbes |date= |accessdate=2013-06-20 |first=Klaus |last=Kneale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some businesses forbid nepotism as an ethical matter, considering it too troublesome and disruptive.

== Types of partiality ==
Nepotism refers to partiality to family whereas [[cronyism]] refers to partiality to an associate or [[friend]].  [[Favoritism]], the broadest of the terms, refers to partiality based upon being part of a favored group, rather than job performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scu.edu/ethics/practicing/focusareas/government_ethics/introduction/cronyism.html | title=Favoritism, Cronyism, and Nepotism | publisher=Santa Clara University | accessdate=June 20, 2013 | author=Judy Nadler and Miriam Schulman}}&lt;/ref&gt;
