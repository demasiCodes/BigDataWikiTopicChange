'''Nepotism''' is [[In-group favoritism|favoritism]] that is granted to [[Kinship|relatives]] or [[friend]]s in various fields, including business, politics, entertainment, sports, religion and other activities. The term originated with the assignment of nephews to important positions by [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[pope]]s and [[bishop]]s.

Nepotism has been criticized since the ancient times by several philosophers, including [[Aristotle]], [[Valluvar]], and [[Confucius]]. For instance, the ancient Indian philosopher Valluvar condemned nepotism as both evil and unwise.&lt;ref name="PSSundaram_Kural"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Middle Ages]] and until the late 17th century, some [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[pope]]s and [[bishop]]s – who had taken vows of [[chastity]] and, therefore, usually had no legitimate offspring of their own – gave their nephews such positions of preference as were often accorded by fathers to sons.&lt;ref name="Article Nepotism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Article Nepotism |work=New Catholic Dictionary |url=http://catholic-forum.com/saints/ncd05726.htm |accessdate=12 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224025607/http://www.catholic-forum.com/Saints/ncd05726.htm |archivedate=24 February 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Several popes [[Cardinal-nephew|elevated nephews]] and other relatives to the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinalate]]. Often, such appointments were a means of continuing a papal "dynasty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gianvittorio Signorotto|author2=Maria Antonietta Visceglia|title=Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2W1tc-wf5DQC&amp;pg=PA114|accessdate=20 June 2013|date=21 March 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43141-5|pages=114–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Pope Callixtus III]], head of the [[House of Borgia|Borgia]] family, made two of his nephews cardinals; one of them, Rodrigo, later used his position as a cardinal as a stepping stone to the papacy, becoming [[Pope Alexander VI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander then elevated Alessandro Farnese, his mistress's brother, to cardinal; Farnese would later go on to become [[Pope Paul III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul III also engaged in nepotism, appointing, for instance, two nephews, aged 14 and 16, as cardinals. The practice was finally limited when [[Pope Innocent XII]] issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Romanum decet Pontificem]]'', in 1692.&lt;ref name="Article Nepotism"/&gt; The papal bull prohibited popes in all times from bestowing estates, offices, or revenues on any relative, with the exception that one qualified relative (at most) could be made a cardinal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anura Gurugé|title=The Next Pope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B5JVthemvvwC&amp;pg=PA115|accessdate=20 June 2013|date=16 February 2010|publisher=Anura Guruge|isbn=978-0-615-35372-2|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mention in ancient literature===
In the [[Book of Porul|second book]] of the [[Tirukkural|Kural literature]], which forms a manual for governments and corporations, [[Valluvar]] suggests about nepotism and favouritism thus: "If you choose an unfit person for your job just because you love and you like him, he will lead you to endless follies."&lt;ref&gt;[https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/rediscovering-a-management-and-leadership-manual-in-ancient-indian-literature/ Rediscovering a Management and Leadership Manual in Ancient Indian Literature - Knowledge@Wharton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, nepotism is both evil and unwise.&lt;ref name="PSSundaram_Kural"/&gt;

== Types ==

=== Political ===
Nepotism is a common accusation in politics when the relative of a powerful figure ascends to similar power seemingly without appropriate qualifications. The [[British English]] expression "[[Bob's your uncle]]" is thought to have originated when [[Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury]], promoted his nephew, [[Arthur Balfour]], to the esteemed post of [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], which was widely seen as an act of nepotism.&lt;ref name=Trahair&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=K0zrsHO27-wC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72 ''From Aristotelian to Reaganomics: A Dictionary of Eponyms With Biographies in the Social Science''], by R. C. S. Trahair, [[Greenwood Publishing Group]], 1994, p. 72. Retrieved online from [[Google Books]], 30 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organizational ===
Nepotism can also occur within organizations, when a person is employed due to their familial ties. It is generally seen as unethical, both on the part of the employer and employee.&lt;ref&gt;"Richard Utz, "Beyond Consanguinity," ''[https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2010/03/24/beyond-consanguinity Inside Higher Ed]'', 24 March, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In employment ====
Nepotism at work can mean increased opportunity at a job, attaining the job or being paid more than other similarly situated people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safeworkers.co.uk/nepotismatwork.html |title=Nepotism at Work |publisher=Safeworkers.co.uk |date=20 April 2013 |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments are made both for and against employment granted due to a family connection, which is most common in small, family run businesses. On one hand, nepotism can provide stability and continuity. Critics cite studies that demonstrate decreased morale and commitment from non-related employees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/contributors.asp?id=1625 |title=Family Ties: Handling Nepotism Within Your Business - Perspectives - Inside INdiana Business with Gerry Dick |publisher=Insideindianabusiness.com |date=9 November 2010 |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and a generally negative attitude towards superior positions filled through nepotism. An article from ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine stated "there is no ladder to climb when the top rung is reserved for people with a certain name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2009/06/19/ceo-executive-hiring-ceonewtork-leadership-nepotism.html |title=Is Nepotism So Bad? |work=Forbes |date= |accessdate=20 June 2013 |first=Klaus |last=Kneale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some businesses forbid nepotism as an ethical matter, considering it too troublesome and disruptive.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

====In entertainment====
Outside of national politics, accusations of "nepotism" are made in instances of ''[[prima facie]]'' favoritism to relatives, in such cases as:
* [[Peaches Geldof]]'s role as magazine editor in an [[MTV]] reality show&amp;nbsp;– produced by a company owned by her father [[Bob Geldof]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/showbiz/showbiznews/2008/03/16/peaches-geldof-bags-tv-reality-show-as-magazine-editor-98487-20353319/ |title=Peaches Geldof bags TV reality show as magazine editor |publisher=Sundaymirror.co.uk |date= |accessdate=6 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524020700/http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/showbiz/showbiznews/2008/03/16/peaches-geldof-bags-tv-reality-show-as-magazine-editor-98487-20353319/ |archivedate=24 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Hollywood's [[Coppola family tree|Coppola family]] includes many distinguished filmmakers and actors. The careers of [[Sofia Coppola]], [[Nicolas Cage]], and [[Jason Schwartzman]] have been attributed to aid by director [[Francis Ford Coppola]], who cast his daughter Sofia in ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/EXTRA_Nepotism_in_the_Directors_Chair/312221 |title=EXTRA: Nepotism in the Director's Chair at |publisher=Hollywood.com |date=21 April 2000 |accessdate=6 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006085336/http://www.hollywood.com/news/EXTRA_Nepotism_in_the_Directors_Chair/312221|archivedate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spiritof1976.livejournal.com/338603.html |title=Nothing is true, everything is permitted - Coppola nepotism hate |publisher=Spiritof1976.livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cage changed his last name in order to distance himself from such charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115/bio Nicolas Cage - imdb biography&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
[[Anna Bligh]], who won the 2009 Queensland State election, has been accused of nepotism by giving her husband Greg Withers a position as the Office of Climate Change head.&lt;ref name="houghton"&gt;Houghton, Des (28 June 2008).

Shortly after his appointment as the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney in 2001, [[Peter Jensen (bishop)|Peter Jensen]] was accused, in an Australian Broadcasting Corporation interview, of nepotism after nominating his brother [[Phillip Jensen]] as Dean of Sydney and appointing his wife Christine Jensen to an official position in the Sydney diocese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/stories/s728866.htm |title=AM - Archbishop Jensen accused of nepotism |work=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=18 November 2002 |accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
In Greece it is common practice for family members of current or former party leaders to be party members and get appointed as ministers when the party is in government.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lifo.gr/now/politics/255152/to-fainomeno-tis-oikogeneiokratias-sti-voyli-apo-ti-metapoliteysi-mexri-simera&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there have been 3 Prime ministers from the [[List of political families in Greece#P|Papandreou family]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/13/business/global/papandreou-family-shapes-history-in-greece.html&lt;/ref&gt;, 2 from the [[List of political families in Greece#M|Mitsotakis family ]](1 currently serving)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-48902766&lt;/ref&gt;, 2 from the [[List of political families in Greece#K|Karamanlis family ]](a 3rd one is currently serving as Minister of transportation).

=== Azerbaijan ===

=== Belgium ===
Over the past decade, criticism has been growing over the creation of political dynasties in Belgium, in which all of the traditional political parties have been involved. This phenomenon has been explained by the fact that prominent party members control the ranking of candidates on party lists for elections and a candidate's place on a list determines whether or not he or she is elected. Another justification for the phenomenon is the importance of name recognition for collecting votes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/buitenland/3376470/__Politiek_Belgie_is_familiezaak__.html?p=7,1 |title=Politiek België is familiezaak - Buitenland - Telegraaf.nl [24 uur actueel, ook mobiel&amp;#93; [buitenland&amp;#93; |publisher=Telegraaf.nl |date= |accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims of nepotism have been made against [[Bruno Tobback]], the son of senator and former minister [[Louis Tobback]], a member of the Flemish socialists, became the Belgian federal government's minister for the pensions and environment at 35 in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ipe.com/magazine/tobback-making-his-mark_17630.php#.UcPF2ZzgUoI | title=Tobback: making his mark | publisher=IPE International Publishers Limited | work=Investment &amp; Pensions Europe | date=1 March 2005 | accessdate=20 June 2013 | author=Martin Hurst}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alexander De Croo]], the son of former speaker of the Belgian parliament Herman De Croo, ran for the leadership of his father's party Open VLD at age 33.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gva.be/nieuws/binnenland/aid874229/alexander-de-croo-wil-voorzitter-open-vld-worden.aspx?cmt=all |title=Alexander De Croo wil voorzitter Open Vld worden |publisher=Gva.be |date= |accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally there is the example of [[Maya Detiège]], the daughter of former mayor of the city of [[Antwerp]] Leona Detiège, who herself is the daughter of the former mayor of [[Antwerp]] Frans Detiège.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

=== Cambodia ===
Prime Minister [[Hun Sen]] and senior members of [[Parliament of Cambodia|Parliament]], are also known for their hand in getting family members into government positions. In the [[Cambodian parliamentary election, 2013|2013 Cambodian parliamentary elections]], at least eight candidates standing in the upcoming July election are sons of high-ranking [[Cambodian People’s Party]] officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/2013050665421/National/sons-of-the-party-anointed.html |title=Sons of the party anointed |publisher= Meas Sokchea |date=6 May 2013 |accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; All ruling party sons lost, but were appointed into high government positions.

=== Mauritius ===
Since the first democratic [[1948 Mauritian general election|elections of 1948]] and subsequent elections, the field of politics in Mauritius has been marked by a handful of families who have controlled the four major political parties which exist to this day. They are often referred to as the "modern dynasties" of Mauritian politics such as the Duval, Bérenger, Curé, Uteem, Mohamed, Boolell, Ramgoolam and Jugnauth families.For instance the Boolell family's involvement in politics started with [[Satcam Boolell]] in 1955 and he paved the way for his son [[Arvin Boolell]], nephews Satish Boolell, Anil Gayan, Sanjay Bhuckory and son-in-law Sushil Kushiram. The Duval dynasty started with ex-Lord Mayor and minister Gaetan Duval, followed by his sons Xavier and Richard as well as grand-son Adrien. Lall Jugnauth was the first of his clan to enter politics in the 1950s and he was followed by his cousins Aneerood and Ashock as well as nephew Pravind. Abdool Razack Mohamed who migrated from India in the 1930s became Lord Mayor and minister and his son Yousuf and grand-son Shakeel were also elected and served as ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hilbert |first1=Patrick |title=Ces dynasties qui règnent sur la politique |url=https://defimedia.info/ces-dynasties-qui-regnent-sur-la-politique |website=defimedia.info |publisher=Defimedia Group |accessdate=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the electoral defeat of the Labour Party in 2014 ex-Prime Minister [[Navin Ramgoolam]] was arrested on suspicions of money laundering and conspiracy. A police raid of his house exposed several safes containing brand new bank notes to the value of Rs 220 Million rupees, exclusive credit cards and prescription medication tablets. His girlfriend Nandanee Oogarah-Soornack, accompanied by the ex Prime Minister's daughter Xara, had escaped Mauritius to her castle in Parmes, Italy a day before the proclamation of election results with an estimated Rs 800 Million rupees.

After the December 2014 elections the new government instigated criminal proceedings to recover about 1,000 acres (1,150 arpents) of state-owned land which had been allocated to the activists and allies of the ex-PM [[Navin Ramgoolam]] under his [[Labour Party (Mauritius)|Labour]] government since 2005. The legal documentation was lodged with the State Law Office (SLO) and Central Criminal Investigation Department (CCID) is also involved in the inquiry. The principal recipients of the various lots of Crown land were Arya Samaj activist and Labour Party activist Suryadeo Sungkur (beachfront land for his restaurant Ritum Coffee at Trou Aux Biches), Lekram Nunlall (Tarisa Resort), Navin Unoop (Voice of Hindu and Vijay Om Hamara)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Terres de l'Etat: la VoH chassée de La Vigie |url=https://www.lexpress.mu/article/259309/terres-letat-voh-chassee-vigie |website=lexpress.mu |publisher=L'Express |accessdate=2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Corporate Hotel Ltd (30 arpents since 2009), British American Investment (BAI) Dawood Rawat's subsidiary Tucson Ltd (20 arpents), Dhanjay Callikan (4 arpents in Balaclava for the brother of Dan Callikan, Navin Ramgoolam's former adviser and former head of Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation (MBC)), Sandranee Ramjoorawon (also known as "Sandy" the cousin of Navin Ramgoolam who received 7.3 arpents in Palmar for an apartment complex via company Dream Spa &amp; Resorts Limited).

Tommy Ah-Teck received 19.7 arpents at Albion Beach for the constrution of a brand new hotel through his company Insignia Leisure Resorts Ltd. Ah-Teck's company Gamma renovated and extended the house owned by Nandanee Oogarah-Soornack, the girlfriend of ex-Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam. Another of Ah-Teck's company (Lottotech) was granted its gambling-house permit by Navin Ramgoolam. Labour Party Treasurer Deva Virahsawmy's company Midas Acropolis was also granted 31 arpents of Crown land at St-Félix after the Labour government cancelled the development permit previously awarded to a businessmean from Reunion Island.  Prior to the December 2014 elections the ministry held by Deva Virahsawmy awarded approved the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) for land clearing of the 31 arpents in preparation of the development of a new hotel. Within the harbour precinct state land was granted to Beta Cement which is a subsidiary of Betonix which is owned by Veekram Bhunjun, who is the brother of ex-minister Rajesh Jeetah's wife. Bhunjun was also awarded 12.5 arpents at Petite-Rivière-Noire via his company Western Marina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Terres de l'Etat: ces proches du PTr ciblés par le gouvernement |url=https://www.lexpress.mu/article/259340/terres-letat-proches-ptr-cibles-gouvernement |website=lexpress.mu |publisher=L'Express |accessdate=2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 when the Labour Party was in office and under [[Navin Ramgoolam]]'s rule a new private company called Pride Bridge Limited was formed by the father of [[Navin Ramgoolam]]'s girlfriend and his associates. The directors were Habeemanoo Soornack (Nandanee's father), Anishta Gooljaury (ex-wife of Rakesh Goolajaury), Surya Foolee and Lubine Holdings.
