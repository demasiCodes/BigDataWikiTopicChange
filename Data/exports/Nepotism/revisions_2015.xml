'''Nepotism''' is [[favoritism]] granted to [[Kinship|relatives]]. The term originated with the assignment of nephews to cardinal positions by [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[pope]]s and [[bishop]]s. Nepotism can occur in various fields including: politics, entertainment, business, and religion.&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary"&gt;{{cite web | title = Nepotism | publisher = The Free Dictionary | url = http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nepotism | accessdate = September 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nepotism "Nepotism."] Dictionary.com.

&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Middle Ages]] and until the late 17th century, some [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[pope]]s and [[bishop]]s, who had taken vows of [[chastity]], and therefore usually had no legitimate offspring of their own, gave their nephews such positions of preference as were often accorded by fathers to son.&lt;ref name="Article Nepotism"&gt;{{cite web

Several popes [[Cardinal-nephew|elevated nephews]] and other relatives to the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinalate]]. Often, such appointments were a means of continuing a papal "dynasty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gianvittorio Signorotto|author2=Maria Antonietta Visceglia|title=Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2W1tc-wf5DQC&amp;pg=PA114|accessdate=20 June 2013|date=21 March 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43141-5|pages=114–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Pope Callixtus III]], head of the [[House of Borgia|Borgia]] family, made two of his nephews cardinals; one of them, Rodrigo, later used his position as a cardinal as a stepping stone to the papacy, becoming [[Pope Alexander VI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander then elevated Alessandro Farnese, his mistress's brother, to cardinal; Farnese would later go on to become [[Pope Paul III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul III also engaged in nepotism, appointing, for instance, two nephews, aged 14 and 16, as cardinals. The practice was finally ended when [[Pope Innocent XII]] issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Romanum decet Pontificem]]'', in 1692.&lt;ref name="Article Nepotism"/&gt; The papal bull prohibited popes in all times from bestowing estates, offices, or revenues on any relative, with the exception that one qualified relative (at most) could be made a cardinal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anura Gurugé|title=The Next Pope|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=B5JVthemvvwC&amp;pg=PA115|accessdate=20 June 2013|date=16 February 2010|publisher=Anura Guruge|isbn=978-0-615-35372-2|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of nepotism ==

=== Political ===
Nepotism is a common accusation in politics when the relative of a powerful figure ascends to similar power seemingly without appropriate qualifications. The [[British English]] expression "[[Bob's your uncle]]" is thought to have originated when [[Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury]], promoted his nephew, [[Arthur Balfour]], to the esteemed post of [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], which was widely seen as an act of nepotism.&lt;ref name=Trahair&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=K0zrsHO27-wC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72 ''From Aristotelian to Reaganomics: A Dictionary of Eponyms With Biographies in the Social Science''], by R. C. S. Trahair, [[Greenwood Publishing Group]], 1994, page 72. Retrieved online from [[Google Books]], Jul 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organizational ===
Nepotism can also occur within organizations, when a person is employed due to their familial ties. It is generally seen as unethical, both on the part of the employer and employee. 

=== In employment ===
Nepotism at work can mean increased opportunity at a job, attaining the job or being paid more than other similarly situated people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safeworkers.co.uk/nepotismatwork.html |title=Nepotism at Work |publisher=Safeworkers.co.uk |date=2013-04-20 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments are made both for and against employment granted due to a family connection, which is most common in small, family run businesses. On one hand, nepotism can provide stability and continuity. Critics cite studies that demonstrate decreased morale and commitment from non-related employees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/contributors.asp?id=1625 |title=Family Ties: Handling Nepotism Within Your Business - Perspectives - Inside INdiana Business with Gerry Dick |publisher=Insideindianabusiness.com |date=2010-11-09 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and a generally negative attitude towards superior positions filled through nepotism. An article from ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine stated "there is no ladder to climb when the top rung is reserved for people with a certain name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2009/06/19/ceo-executive-hiring-ceonewtork-leadership-nepotism.html |title=Is Nepotism So Bad? |publisher=Forbes |date= |accessdate=2013-06-20 |first=Klaus |last=Kneale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some businesses forbid nepotism as an ethical matter, considering it too troublesome and disruptive.

== Types of partiality ==
Nepotism refers to partiality to family whereas [[cronyism]] refers to partiality to an associate or [[friend]].  [[Favoritism]], the broadest of the terms, refers to partiality based upon being part of a favored group, rather than job performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scu.edu/ethics/practicing/focusareas/government_ethics/introduction/cronyism.html | title=Favoritism, Cronyism, and Nepotism | publisher=Santa Clara University | accessdate=June 20, 2013 | author=Judy Nadler and Miriam Schulman}}&lt;/ref&gt;
