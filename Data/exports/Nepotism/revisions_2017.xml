'''Nepotism''' is based on favour granted to [[Kinship|relatives]] in various fields, including business, politics, entertainment, sports, religion and other activities.

The term originated with the assignment of nephews to important positions by [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[pope]]s and [[bishop]]s.

==Origins==
{{Main|Cardinal-nephew}}
The term comes from Italian word ''nepotismo'',&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nepotism "Nepotism."] Dictionary.com. Retrieved 20 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Middle Ages]] and until the late 17th century, some [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[pope]]s and [[bishop]]s, who had taken vows of [[chastity]], and therefore usually had no legitimate offspring of their own, gave their nephews such positions of preference as were often accorded by fathers to son.&lt;ref name="Article Nepotism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Article Nepotism |work=New Catholic Dictionary |url=http://catholic-forum.com/saints/ncd05726.htm |accessdate=2007-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224025607/http://www.catholic-forum.com/Saints/ncd05726.htm |archivedate=February 24, 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Several popes [[Cardinal-nephew|elevated nephews]] and other relatives to the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinalate]]. Often, such appointments were a means of continuing a papal "dynasty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gianvittorio Signorotto|author2=Maria Antonietta Visceglia|title=Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2W1tc-wf5DQC&amp;pg=PA114|accessdate=20 June 2013|date=21 March 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43141-5|pages=114–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Pope Callixtus III]], head of the [[House of Borgia|Borgia]] family, made two of his nephews cardinals; one of them, Rodrigo, later used his position as a cardinal as a stepping stone to the papacy, becoming [[Pope Alexander VI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul III also engaged in nepotism, appointing, for instance, two nephews, aged 14 and 16, as cardinals. The practice was finally limited when [[Pope Innocent XII]] issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Romanum decet Pontificem]]'', in 1692.&lt;ref name="Article Nepotism"/&gt; The papal bull prohibited popes in all times from bestowing estates, offices, or revenues on any relative, with the exception that one qualified relative (at most) could be made a cardinal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anura Gurugé|title=The Next Pope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B5JVthemvvwC&amp;pg=PA115|accessdate=20 June 2013|date=16 February 2010|publisher=Anura Guruge|isbn=978-0-615-35372-2|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

=== Political ===
Nepotism is a common accusation in politics when the relative of a powerful figure ascends to similar power seemingly without appropriate qualifications. The [[British English]] expression "[[Bob's your uncle]]" is thought to have originated when [[Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury]], promoted his nephew, [[Arthur Balfour]], to the esteemed post of [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], which was widely seen as an act of nepotism.&lt;ref name=Trahair&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=K0zrsHO27-wC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72 ''From Aristotelian to Reaganomics: A Dictionary of Eponyms With Biographies in the Social Science''], by R. C. S. Trahair, [[Greenwood Publishing Group]], 1994, page 72. Retrieved online from [[Google Books]], Jul 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organizational ===
Nepotism can also occur within organizations, when a person is employed due to their familial ties. It is generally seen as unethical, both on the part of the employer and employee.

==== In employment ====
Nepotism at work can mean increased opportunity at a job, attaining the job or being paid more than other similarly situated people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safeworkers.co.uk/nepotismatwork.html |title=Nepotism at Work |publisher=Safeworkers.co.uk |date=2013-04-20 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments are made both for and against employment granted due to a family connection, which is most common in small, family run businesses. On one hand, nepotism can provide stability and continuity. Critics cite studies that demonstrate decreased morale and commitment from non-related employees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/contributors.asp?id=1625 |title=Family Ties: Handling Nepotism Within Your Business - Perspectives - Inside INdiana Business with Gerry Dick |publisher=Insideindianabusiness.com |date=2010-11-09 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and a generally negative attitude towards superior positions filled through nepotism. An article from ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine stated "there is no ladder to climb when the top rung is reserved for people with a certain name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/06/19/ceo-executive-hiring-ceonewtork-leadership-nepotism.html |title=Is Nepotism So Bad? |publisher=Forbes |date= |accessdate=2013-06-20 |first=Klaus |last=Kneale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some businesses forbid nepotism as an ethical matter, considering it too troublesome and disruptive.

====In entertainment====
Outside of national politics, accusations of "nepotism" are made in instances of ''[[prima facie]]'' favoritism to relatives, in such cases as:
* [[Peaches Geldof]]'s role as magazine editor in an [[MTV]] reality show&amp;nbsp;– produced by a company owned by her father [[Bob Geldof]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/showbiz/showbiznews/2008/03/16/peaches-geldof-bags-tv-reality-show-as-magazine-editor-98487-20353319/ |title=Peaches Geldof bags TV reality show as magazine editor |publisher=Sundaymirror.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524020700/http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/showbiz/showbiznews/2008/03/16/peaches-geldof-bags-tv-reality-show-as-magazine-editor-98487-20353319/ |archivedate=May 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anna Bligh]], who won the 2009 Queensland State election, has been accused of nepotism by giving her husband Greg Withers a position as the Office of Climate Change head.&lt;ref name="houghton"&gt;Houghton, Des (2008-06-28).

Shortly after his appointment as the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney in 2001, [[Peter Jensen (bishop)|Peter Jensen]] was accused, in an Australian Broadcasting Corporation interview, of nepotism after nominating his brother [[Phillip Jensen]] as Dean of Sydney and appointing his wife Christine Jensen to an official position in the Sydney diocese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/stories/s728866.htm |title=AM - Archbishop Jensen accused of nepotism |work=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2002-11-18 |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Azerbaijan ===
On 21 February 2017, [[President of Azerbaijan]] [[Ilham Aliyev]] appointed his wife [[Mehriban Aliyeva]] to be [[Vice President of Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meeting of Security Council held under chairmanship of President Ilham Aliyev VIDEO|url=http://azertag.az/en/xeber/1037089|accessdate=11 March 2017|agency=Azertag|date=21 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belgium ===
Over the past decade, criticism has been growing over the creation of political dynasties in Belgium, in which all of the traditional political parties have been involved. This phenomenon has been explained by the fact that prominent party members control the ranking of candidates on party lists for elections and a candidate's place on a list determines whether or not he or she is elected. Another justification for the phenomenon is the importance of name recognition for collecting votes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/buitenland/3376470/__Politiek_Belgie_is_familiezaak__.html?p=7,1 |title=Politiek België is familiezaak - Buitenland - Telegraaf.nl [24 uur actueel, ook mobiel&amp;#93; [buitenland&amp;#93; |publisher=Telegraaf.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims of nepotism have been made against [[Bruno Tobback]], the son of senator and former minister [[Louis Tobback]], a member of the Flemish socialists, became the Belgian federal government's minister for the pensions and environment at 35 in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ipe.com/magazine/tobback-making-his-mark_17630.php#.UcPF2ZzgUoI | title=Tobback: making his mark | publisher=IPE International Publishers Limited | work=Investment &amp; Pensions Europe | date=1 Mar 2005 | accessdate=20 June 2013 | author=Martin Hurst}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alexander De Croo]], the son of former speaker of the Belgian parliament Herman De Croo, ran for the leadership of his father's party Open VLD at age 33.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gva.be/nieuws/binnenland/aid874229/alexander-de-croo-wil-voorzitter-open-vld-worden.aspx?cmt=all |title=Alexander De Croo wil voorzitter Open Vld worden |publisher=Gva.be |date= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally there is the example of [[Maya Detiège]], the daughter of former mayor of the city of [[Antwerp]] Leona Detiège, who herself is the daughter of the former mayor of [[Antwerp]] Frans Detiège.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
Among other examples are former minister Freya Vandenbossche and senator Jean Jacques De Gucht, being the daughter and son of respectively former minister Luc Vandenbossche and former minister Karel De Gucht.

=== Cambodia ===
Prime Minister [[Hun Sen]] and senior members of [[Parliament of Cambodia|Parliament]], are also known for their hand in getting family members into government positions. In the [[Cambodian parliamentary election, 2013|2013 Cambodian parliamentary elections]], at least eight candidates standing in the upcoming July election are sons of high-ranking [[Cambodian People’s Party]] officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/2013050665421/National/sons-of-the-party-anointed.html |title=Sons of the party anointed |publisher= Meas Sokchea |date=2013-05-06 |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; All ruling party sons lost, but were appointed into high government positions.

=== India ===
Corruption goes hand in hand with nepotism in India. It goes on in government and private jobs both. Nepotism is common in politics, business and in the movie industry. It goes on even in religious circles, arts, industry, and other types of organizations. Many members of parliament and the Legislative Assembly have a generations-long legacy of nepotic allocation of constituencies to their relatives. The [[Bajaj Group|Bajaj]] family is related to the [[Birla family]] which itself is related to the [[Kishore Biyani|Biyani]] family by marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.ndtv.com/photos/business/the-family-connections-of-india-inc-14191|title=The family connections of India Inc|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kapoor family|Kapoor families]], and many other Indian movie actors have brought their children into the movie industry with their endorsement. The successful actress Priyanka Chopra (now international) said in an interview that she was kicked out of a movie (which was originally offered to her) because of nepotism. Moreover, dynasty in politics remains. [[Rahul Gandhi]], Vice-President of the [[Indian National Congress]] party, is a descendent of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Indira Gandhi]] &amp; [[Rajiv Gandhi]]. Cricket is also affected with nepotism in the form of [[Stuart Binny]] and [[Rohan Gavaskar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/12/world/asia/12iht-letter12.html|title=Across India, Nepotism as a Way of Life|date=12 April 2012|work=International Herald Tribune|via=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/nepotism-the-way-they-do-politics-in-india-20140327-zqnpg.html|title=Nepotism: the way they do politics in India|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The president's brother, [[Gotabhaya Rajapaksa]], was given the post of [[Ministry of Defence (Sri Lanka)|Defence Secretary]]. He also controlled the armed forces, the police and the Coast Guard, and was responsible for immigration and emigration. Rajapaksa appointed his brother [[Basil Rajapaksa]] as minister of [[Ministry of Youth Empowerment and Socio Economic Development (Sri Lanka)|Economic Development]]. Together, the Rajapaksa brothers controlled over 70% of Sri Lanka's public budget.
