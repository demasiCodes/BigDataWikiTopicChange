'''Nepotism''' is the granting of jobs to one's  [[Kinship|relatives]] or [[Friendship|friends]] in various fields, including [[business]], [[politics]], [[entertainment]], [[sports]], [[religion]] and other activities. Nepotism is the act of using one's power to secure better jobs or unfair advantages for a family member when they may not have the right skill, experience or motivation compared to others. The term originated with the assignment of nephews to important positions by [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[pope]]s and [[bishop]]s. [[Corruption in Lithuania#Nepotism|Trading parliamentary employment for favors]] is a modern-day example of nepotism.{{fact|date=January 2019}} 

Nepotism refers to partiality to family whereas [[cronyism]] refers to partiality to a partner or [[Friendship|friend]]. [[In-group favoritism|Favoritism]], the broadest of the terms, refers to partiality based upon being part of a favored group, rather than job performance. Favoritism is a part of any human society and the two branches of favoritism are cronyism and nepotism.  Situations of nepotism refer to when a politician’s son gets a similar political position in a country, and situations when relatives of high ranking officers get easy positions in their career. This happens despite the relatives lacking the necessary qualifications. Situations of cronyism refer to where someone might get a position in a company since he is a friend of the company CEO. Nepotism and cronyism have negative consequences because the truly qualified and talented people have to face injustices and it eventually leads to corruption and brain drains. Moreover, these three are unethical practices that create [[social discrimination]].

Nepotism has been criticized since the ancient times by several philosophers, including [[Aristotle]], [[Valluvar]], and [[Confucius]]. For instance, the ancient Indian philosopher Valluvar condemned nepotism as both evil and unwise.&lt;ref name="PSSundaram_Kural"&gt;{{cite book

== Origin of the modern concept and etymology ==
{{Main|Cardinal-nephew}}
Borrowed from the French term 'Nepotisme', which in turn was derived from Italian 'Nepotismo' and the Latin 'nepōs' (nephews), nepotism refers to the practice of popes appointing relatives during the Middle Age and Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nepotism&lt;/ref&gt; The term comes from the Italian word ''nepotismo'',&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nepotism "Nepotism."] Dictionary.com.

Since the [[Middle Ages]] and until the late 17th century, some [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[pope]]s and [[bishop]]s, who had taken vows of [[chastity]] and therefore usually had no legitimate offspring of their own, gave their nephews such positions of preference as were often accorded by fathers to sons.&lt;ref name="Article Nepotism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Article Nepotism |work=New Catholic Dictionary |url=http://catholic-forum.com/saints/ncd05726.htm |accessdate=12 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224025607/http://www.catholic-forum.com/Saints/ncd05726.htm |archivedate=24 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several popes [[Cardinal-nephew|elevated nephews]] and other relatives to the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinalate]]. Often, such appointments were a means of continuing a papal "dynasty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gianvittorio Signorotto|author2=Maria Antonietta Visceglia|title=Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492–1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2W1tc-wf5DQC&amp;pg=PA114|accessdate=20 June 2013|date=21 March 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43141-5|pages=114–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Pope Callixtus III]], head of the [[House of Borgia|Borgia]] family, made two of his nephews cardinals; one of them, Rodrigo, later used his position as a cardinal as a stepping stone to the papacy, becoming [[Pope Alexander VI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=12 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul III also engaged in nepotism, appointing, for instance, two nephews, aged 14 and 16, as cardinals, as well as making efforts to increase the territories of his illegitimate son [[Pier Luigi Farnese, Duke of Parma|Pier Luigi Farnese]]. The practice was finally limited when [[Pope Innocent XII]] issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Romanum decet pontificem|Romanum decet Pontificem]]'', in 1692.&lt;ref name="Article Nepotism" /&gt; The papal bull prohibited popes in all times from bestowing estates, offices, or revenues on any relative, with the exception that one qualified relative (at most) could be made a cardinal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anura Gurugé|title=The Next Pope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B5JVthemvvwC&amp;pg=PA115|accessdate=20 June 2013|date=16 February 2010|publisher=Anura Guruge|isbn=978-0-615-35372-2|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In ancient literature==
===Kural literature===
In the [[Book of Porul|second book]] of the [[Tirukkural|Kural literature]], which forms a manual for governments and corporations, [[Valluvar]] suggests about nepotism and favouritism thus: "If you choose an unfit person for your job just because you love and you like him, he will lead you to endless follies."&lt;ref&gt;https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/rediscovering-a-management-and-leadership-manual-in-ancient-indian-literature/&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, nepotism is both evil and unwise.&lt;ref name="PSSundaram_Kural"/&gt;

It is a common accusation in politics when the relative of a powerful figure ascends to similar power seemingly without appropriate qualifications. The [[British English]] expression "[[Bob's your uncle]]" is thought to have originated when [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury]], promoted his nephew, [[Arthur Balfour]], to the esteemed post of [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], which was widely seen as an act of nepotism.&lt;ref name=Trahair&gt;{{cite book

One other recent example is the current Portuguese government which counts no less than 50 nominations within family ties.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rtp.pt/noticias/politica/o-nepotismo-e-o-governo-mais-de-duas-dezenas-de-parentescos_v1131035&lt;/ref&gt; Another more recent example can be found in the political activity in South Carolina, particularly in relation to Governor McMaster, who initially gained his position after becoming the first high level state official to endorse current President Donald Trump and subsequently rose from lieutenant governor to governor of the state when President Trump appointed Nikki Haley to be the United States ambassador to the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/01/27/trump-picks-up-endorsement-from-s-c-lt-gov-henry-mcmaster/|title=Trump picks up endorsement from S.C.

=== Organizational ===
Nepotism can also occur within organizations when a person is employed due to familial ties. It is generally seen as unethical, both on the part of the employer and employee.

==== In employment ====
Nepotism at work can mean increased opportunity at a job, attaining the job or being paid more than other similarly situated people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safeworkers.co.uk/nepotismatwork.html |title=Nepotism at Work |publisher=Safeworkers.co.uk |date=20 April 2013 |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments are made both for and against employment granted due to a family connection, which is most common in small, family run businesses. On one hand, nepotism can provide stability and continuity. Critics cite studies that demonstrate decreased morale and commitment from non-related employees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/contributors.asp?id=1625 |title=Family Ties: Handling Nepotism Within Your Business&amp;nbsp;– Perspectives&amp;nbsp;– Inside INdiana Business with Gerry Dick |publisher=Insideindianabusiness.com |date=9 November 2010 |accessdate=20 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514022519/http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/contributors.asp?id=1625 |archivedate=14 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a generally negative attitude towards superior positions filled through nepotism. An article from ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine stated "there is no ladder to climb when the top rung is reserved for people with a certain name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/06/19/ceo-executive-hiring-ceonewtork-leadership-nepotism.html |title=Is Nepotism So Bad? |work=Forbes |date= |accessdate=20 June 2013 |first=Klaus |last=Kneale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some businesses forbid nepotism as an ethical matter, considering it too troublesome and disruptive. According to an article published in [http://scienceimpactpub.com/ojs2/index.php/jei/article/view/4/6 Journal of Economic impact] "Financially strong families can easily influence on the hiring process for obtaining a job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khaliq|first=Muhammad Tanveer|last2=Imran|first2=Muhammad Ali|last3=Ullah|first3=Sammi|last4=Bakhsh|first4=Allah|last5=Aslam|first5=Manan|last6=Tahir|first6=Nimra|last7=Yasin|first7=Mudassar|date=2019-03-25|title=The Impact of Nepotism on Employment Status in Public Sector Institutions: An Evidence from Fresh Graduates of Pakistan|url=http://scienceimpactpub.com/ojs2/index.php/jei/article/view/4|journal=Journal of Economic Impact|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=07–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In entertainment ====
Outside of national politics, accusations of nepotism are made in instances of ''[[prima facie]]'' favoritism to relatives, in such cases as:
