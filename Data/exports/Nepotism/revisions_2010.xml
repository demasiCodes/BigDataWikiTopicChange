'''Nepotism''' is [[favoritism]] granted to [[relatives]] or friends regardless of [[merit]].&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;Modern Language Association (MLA):"nepotism." The American Heritage New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy, Third Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2005. 10 Aug. 2009. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nepotism Dictionary.com].&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''nepotism'' is from the Latin word ''[[wikt:nepos#Latin|nepos]]'' (meaning "nephew" or "grandchild").

== Types of nepotism ==
=== Papal ===
{{Main|Cardinal-nephew}}
Nepotism gained its name after the church practice in the [[Middle Ages]], when some [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[pope]]s and [[bishop]]s, who had taken vows of [[chastity]], and therefore usually had no children of their own, gave their nephews such positions of preference as were often accorded by fathers to son.&lt;ref name="Article Nepotism"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Several popes elevated nephews and other relatives to the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinalate]]. Often, such appointments were a means of continuing a papal "dynasty."

For instance, [[Pope Callixtus III]], head of the [[Borgia]] family, made two of his nephews cardinals; one of them, Rodrigo, later used his position as a cardinal as a stepping stone to the papacy, becoming [[Pope Alexander VI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander then elevated Alessandro Farnese, his mistress's brother, to cardinal; Farnese would later go on to become [[Pope Paul III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul also engaged in nepotism, appointing, for instance, two nephews, aged 14 and 16, as cardinals. The practice was finally ended when [[Pope Innocent XII]] issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Romanum decet Pontificem]]'', in 1692.&lt;ref name="Article Nepotism"/&gt; The papal bull prohibited popes in all times from bestowing estates, offices, or revenues on any relative, with the exception that one qualified relative (at most) could be made a cardinal.

Coincidentally, the [[Church of the East]] from the 16th to the 19th centuries made the Patriarch a hereditary title, being passed down from Patriarch-uncle to nephew; however, this move was initiated in the face of Timur's destruction of Nestorian Monasteries throughout Asia (monks being the key source of priests and patriarchs for the Church), in an attempt to guarantee the existence of a patriarch. This proved to be a catalyst for the schism that exists today between Chaldean Catholics and Assyrian "Nestorians."{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

=== Political ===
Nepotism is a common accusation in politics when the relative of a powerful figure ascends to similar power seemingly without appropriate qualifications. The [[British English]] expression "[[Bob's your uncle]]" is thought to have originated when [[Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury]], promoted his nephew, [[Arthur Balfour]], to the esteemed post of [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]] in what was widely seen as an act of nepotism.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===== [[Belgium]] =====
Over the past decade, criticism has been growing over the creation of political dynasties in Belgium, in which all of the traditional political parties have been involved. This phenomenon has been explained by the fact that prominent party members control the ranking of candidates on party lists for elections and a candidate's place on a list determines whether or not he or she is elected. Another justification for the phenomenon is the importance of name recognition for collecting votes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.telegraaf.nl/buitenland/3376470/__Politiek_Belgie_is_familiezaak__.html?p=7,1 Politiek België is familiezaak - Buitenland - Telegraaf.nl [24 uur actueel, ook mobiel&amp;#93; [buitenland&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Pierre Sarkozy]], first son of President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], asked [http://fr.wikipedia.org/SCPP SCPP] for a financial help in September 2009 of around €10000 towards an (€80000) artistic project.

===== [[India]] =====
* The [[Nehru-Gandhi family]] has shown a strong tendency for nepotism, as manifested through ''dynastic politics'': A recent example is the rise of [[Rahul Gandhi]], son of former prime minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]] and current congressional president [[Sonia Gandhi]] and grandson of former prime minister [[Indira Gandhi]]. In his defense, however, it's not as if the reins of power were directly handed to him: His father and grandmother were both assassinated, and at the 2006 convention of the Indian National Congress, thousands of members sought for him to take a leadership role.

=== In entertainment ===
Outside of national politics, accusations of "nepotism" are made in instances of prima facie favoritism to relatives, in such cases as:
* The casting of [[Tori Spelling]] as Donna Martin in ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' received much criticism. Her father [[Aaron Spelling]] was the executive producer.
* [[Peaches Geldof]]'s role as magazine editor in an [[MTV]] reality show - produced by a company owned by her father [[Bob Geldof]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/showbiz/showbiznews/2008/03/16/peaches-geldof-bags-tv-reality-show-as-magazine-editor-98487-20353319/ Peaches Geldof bags TV reality show as magazine editor]&lt;/ref&gt; In a sketch of ''[[The Kevin Bishop Show]],'' which frequently has less-than-flattering fake perfume adverts for celebrities, there was one for Peaches Geldof: "Nepotism, the smell of Peaches Geldof." Before this, a mock voice said "I'm a fashion model, a TV presenter, and I'm a journalist as well .... Did I mention my dad's Bob Geldof?"{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
* Hollywood's [[Coppola family tree|The Coppola family]] includes many distinguished filmmakers and actors. The careers of [[Sofia Coppola]], [[Nicolas Cage]] and [[Jason Schwartzman]] have been attributed to aid by director [[Francis Ford Coppola]] who cast his daughter Sofia in ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywood.com/news/EXTRA_Nepotism_in_the_Directors_Chair/312221 EXTRA: Nepotism in the Director's Chair at Hollywood.com&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spiritof1976.livejournal.com/338603.html Nothing is true, everything is permitted - Coppola nepotism hate&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Cage changed his last name in order to distance himself from such charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115/bio Nicolas Cage - imdb biography&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jaden Smith]] played the lead role in the remake of ''[[The Karate Kid (2010 film)|The Karate Kid]].'' His parents, movie stars [[Will Smith]] and [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] were co-producers of the movie. His breakout role was in 2006's ''[[The Pursuit of Happyness]]'', where he played the son of [[Will Smith]]'s character. The proud father was one of the producers of the film.
* In 2010, film student [[Cody Gifford]] got a dream summer intern job, reviewing movies for [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Today Show]],'' co-hosted by his mother, [[Kathie Lee Gifford]].
* Many reality television stars became celebrities because of their family connections: [[Paris Hilton]], [[Kim Kardashian]], [[Brooke Hogan]], [[Nicole Richie]], [[Kelly Osbourne]], and [[Brody Jenner]] just to name a few.
* In ''[[According to Jim]],'' the star [[Jim Belushi]] uses his kids in the show.

=== In business ===
*On 13 February 2003, [[James Murdoch (media executive)|James Murdoch]] became a director of [[British Sky Broadcasting|BSkyB]]. Later that year, he controversially became CEO of BSkyB, in which News Corporation owns a controlling minority stake. His appointment sparked accusations of nepotism, with some commentators and shareholders feeling that the job had not been opened to outsiders and that Murdoch was too young and inexperienced to run a UK news agency.
* One-time ''Guardian'' contributor Max Gogarty has also been accused of taking advantage of family connections to achieve success disproportionate to his ability; his father Paul Gogarty is a frequent travel writer for the newspaper.[citation needed]
*Successful Indian steel executive [[O. P. Jindal]]'s sons Prithviraj Jindal, Sajjan Jindal, Rattan Jindal, and Naveen Jindal, now run his empire.
*[[Donald Trump]]'s children, [[Donald Trump, Jr.]], [[Ivanka Trump]] and [[Eric Trump]] are Executive Vice Presidents of Development &amp; Acquisition in their father's company.

=== In popular culture ===
* In the TV series ''[[Parenthood (2010 TV series)|Parenthood]],'' Sarah Braverman mentions nepotism because her brother got her a job at his company.
* In the US version of ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]],'' there was an episode devoted to nepotism.

== Social and economic effects ==
{{Section OR|date=August 2009}}
Nepotism and cronyism can have short- and long-term effects on a society, depending on the extent of the take-up and social acceptability of these practices.

Areas in which, it is believed{{Weasel-inline|date=April 2010}}, nepotism has negative societal effects:
* the [[civil service]]
* intergovernmental relations (ambassadors, civil-service attached personnel)

Also, since a politician or movie star-producer can have more than one child, there is also the related situation of a remaining, resentful, "passed over" child. India's [[M. Karunanidhi|Karunanidhi]] family also illustrates this examples:  Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers [[M.K. Azhagiri]], M. Karunanidhi's second son, was passed over in favor of [[M. K. Stalin]] for the deputy chief minister role. This caused a political rift between the supporters of Azhagiri and Stalin.

== Internal resistance to nepotistic pressure ==
[[M. Karunanidhi|Karunanidhi]] family also has the example of a child that is not interested in the family "business" despite his parents' encouragement and significant advantages. [[M.K. Muthu]], the eldest son, was the first child his father tried unsuccessfully to groom into politics: He is now an actor.
