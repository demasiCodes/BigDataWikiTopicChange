{{Wiktionary}}

'''Empowerment''' refers to increasing the spiritual, political, social, or economic strength of individuals and communities. It often involves the empowered developing confidence in their own capacities.

==Definitions==
The term empowerment covers a vast landscape of meanings, interpretations, definitions and disciplines ranging from psychology and philosophy to the highly commercialized self-help industry and motivational sciences. 

Sociological empowerment often addresses members of groups that social discrimination processes have excluded from  decision-making processes through - for example - discrimination based on disability, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], ethnicity, religion, or gender. Empowerment as a methodology is often associated with [[feminism]]: see [[consciousness-raising]].

==Marginalization and empowerment==
{{Unreferenced|date=July 2007}}
"Marginalized" refers to the overt or covert trends within societies whereby those perceived as lacking desirable traits or deviating from the group norms tend to be excluded by wider society and ostracized as undesirables.

Sometimes groups are marginalized by society at large, but governments are often unwitting or enthusiastic participants. For example, the U.S. government marginalized cultural minorities, particularly blacks, prior to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. This Act made it illegal to restrict access to schools and public places based on race. [[Equal opportunity]] laws which actively oppose such marginalization, allow increased empowerment to occur. They are also a symptom of minorities' and women's empowerment through lobbying.

Marginalized people who have no opportunities for self-sufficiency become, at a minimum, dependent on charity or welfare.  They lose their self-confidence because they cannot be fully self-supporting.  The opportunities denied them also deprive them of the pride of accomplishment which others, who have those opportunities, can develop for themselves. This in turn can lead to psychological, social and even mental health problems.

Empowerment is then the process of obtaining these basic opportunities for marginalized people, either directly by those people, or through the help of non-marginalized others who share their own access to these opportunities. It also includes actively thwarting attempts to deny those opportunities. Empowerment also includes encouraging, and developing the skills for, self-sufficiency, with a focus on eliminating the future need for charity or welfare in the individuals of the group. This process can be difficult to start and to implement effectively, but there are many examples of empowerment projects which have succeeded. {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

One empowerment strategy is to assist marginalized people to create their own nonprofit organization, using the rationale that only the marginalized people, themselves, can know what their own people need most, and that control of the organization by outsiders can actually help to further entrench marginalization. Charitable organizations lead from outside of the community, for example, can disempower the community by entrenching a dependence on charity or welfare. A nonprofit organization can target strategies that cause structural changes, reducing the need for ongoing dependence. [[Red Cross]], for example, can focus on improving the health of indigenous people, but does not have authority in its charter to install water-delivery and purification systems, even though the lack of such a system profoundly, directly and negatively impacts health. A nonprofit composed of the indigenous people, however, could insure their own organization does have such authority and could set their own agendas, make their own plans, seek the needed resources, do as much of the work as they can, and take responsibility - and credit - for the success of their projects (or the consequences, should they fail).

Numerous critical perspectives exist that propose that an empowerment paradigm is present, Clark (2008) showed that whilst there was a degree of autonomy provided by empowerment, it also made way for extended surveillance and control, hence the contradiction perspective (Fardini, 2001).

==The process of empowerment==

The process which enables individuals/groups to fully access personal/collective power, authority and influence, and to employ that strength when engaging with other people, institutions or society. 

In other words, 
“Empowerment is not giving people power, people already have plenty of power, in the wealth of their knowledge and motivation, to do their jobs magnificently. We    
define empowerment as letting this power out (Blanchard, K)."  It encourages people to gain the skills and knowledge that will allow them to overcome obstacles in life or work environment and ultimately, help them develop within themselves or in the society. 

Empowerment includes the following, or similar, capabilities:-
* The ability to make decisions about personal/collective circumstances
* The ability to access information and resources for decision-making 
* Ability to consider a range of options from which to choose (not just yes/no, either/or.) 
* Ability to exercise assertiveness in collective decision making 
* Having positive-thinking about the ability to make change 
* Ability to learn and access skills for improving personal/collective circumstance. 
* Ability to inform others’ perceptions though exchange, education and engagement. 
* Involving in the growth process and changes that is never ending and self-initiated
* Increasing one's positive self-image and overcoming stigma
* Increasing one's ability in discreet thinking to sort out right and wrong

==Workplace empowerment==
One account of the history of workplace empowerment in the [[United States of America|United States]] recalls the clash of management styles in railroad construction in the [[American West]] in the mid-19th century, where "traditional" hierarchical East-Coast models of control encountered individualistic pioneer workers, strongly supplemented by methods of [[efficiency (economics)|efficiency]]-oriented "worker [[Social responsibility|responsibility]]" brought to the scene by [[Chinese American|Chinese]] [[coolie|laborer]]s. In this case, empowerment at the level of work [[team]]s or brigades achieved a notable (but short-lived) demonstrated superiority&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motivation-tools.com/workplace/history.htm views of Robert L. Webb]&lt;/ref&gt;

Empowerment in the workplace is regarded by critics as more a [[pseudo]]-empowerment exercise, the idea of which is to change the attitudes of workers, so as to make them work harder rather than giving them any real power, and Wilkinson (1998) refers to this as "attitudinal shaping". However, recent research suggests that the opportunity to exercise personal discretion/choice (and complete meaningful work) is an important element contributing to [[employee engagement]] and well-being. There is evidence &lt;ref&gt;Thomas and Velthouse, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; that initiative and motivation are increased when people have a more positive attributional style. This influences self-belief, resilience when faced with setbacks, and the ability to visualize oneself overcoming problems. The implication is that 'empowerment' suits some more than others, and should be positioned in the broader and wider context of an 'enabling' work environment.

Empowerment to employees in the work place provides them with opportunities penda to make their own decisions with regards to their tasks. Now-a-days more and more bosses and managers are practicing the concept of empowerment among their subordinates to provide them with better opportunities.

In Management: 

In the book Empowerment Takes More Than a Minute, the authors, Ken Blanchard, John P. Carlos, and Alan Randolph, illustrate three simple keys that organizations can use to effectively open the knowledge, experience, and motivation power that people already have. The three keys are that managers must use to empower their employees are: share information with everyone, create autonomy through boundaries and replace the old hierarchy with self-managed teams. 

Share information with everyone – this is the first key to empowering people within an organization. By sharing information with everyone, you are giving them a clear picture of the company and its current situation. Another strong point that this brings is trust; by allowing all of the employees to view the company information, it helps to build that trust between employer and employee. Create autonomy through boundaries – this is the second key to empowerment which also builds upon the previous one. By opening communication through sharing information, it opens up the feedback about what is holding them back from being empowered. Replace the old hierarchy with self-managed teams – this is the third and final key to empowerment which ties them all together. By replacing the old hierarchy with self-managed teams, more responsibility is placed upon unique and self-managed teams which create better communication and productivity. &lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, Kenneth H., John P. Carlos, and Alan Randolph. Empowerment Takes More than a Minute. San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics and empowerment==
In [[economic development]], the empowerment approach focuses on mobilizing the [[self-help]] efforts of the poor, rather than providing them with [[social welfare]]. Economic empowerment is also the empowering of previously disadvantaged sections of the population, for example, in many previously colonized African countries&lt;ref&gt;www.microempowering.org&lt;/ref&gt;.
