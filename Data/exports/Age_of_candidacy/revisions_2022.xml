{{Youth rights sidebar}}{{Discrimination sidebar|state=collapsed}}
'''Age of candidacy''' is the minimum age at which a person can [[Law|legally]] hold certain elected government offices. In many cases, it also determines the age at which a person may be [[nomination rules|eligible to stand]] for an election or be granted [[ballot access]].

The first known example of a law enforcing age of candidacy was the ''[[Lex Villia Annalis]]'', a Roman law enacted in 180 BCE which set the minimum ages for senatorial [[Roman Magistrates|magistrates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Magistrates of the Roman Republic|first=Thomas|last=Broughton|author2=Marcia Patterson|publisher=American Philological Association|year=1951|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
[[File:Jenness for President pin.jpg|thumb|right|In 1972, [[Linda Jenness]] ran for president of the United States, although she was 31 at the time.]]
Many [[youth rights]] groups view current age of candidacy requirements as unjustified [[Ageism|age discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BYC Youth Manifesto |publisher=British Youth Council |year=2008 |url=http://www.byc.org.uk/asset_store/documents/amd5a_youth_manifesto_(annual_meeting_version).pdf |access-date=28 July 2008 |quote=Young people believe that the age to stand as candidates for local, regional, national and European elections should be 16, as should the age to become a trustee of a charity. Young people have significant responsibilities to society at the age of 16 and can have significant responsibilities in the private sector as company directors; this inconsistency should be rectified. Young people have lots to offer and the decision of their appointment to positions of political authority or governance of organisations should be in the hands of the electorate or membership respectfully. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306185939/http://www.byc.org.uk/asset_store/documents/amd5a_youth_manifesto_%28annual_meeting_version%29.pdf |archive-date=6 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally people who are younger than the minimum age will run for an office in protest of the requirement or because they do not know that the requirement exists. On extremely rare occasions, young people have been elected to offices they do not qualify for and have been deemed ineligible to assume the office.

In 1934, [[Rush Holt Sr.|Rush Holt]] of West Virginia was elected to the [[Senate of the United States]] at the age of 29. Since the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] requires senators to be at least 30, Holt was forced to wait until his 30th birthday, six months after the start of the session, before being sworn in.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070310232816/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,930751,00.html Unsworn Senators]". ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' (14 January 1935).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, [[Richard Fulton]] won election to the [[Tennessee Senate]]. Shortly after being sworn in, Fulton was ousted from office because he was 27 years old at the time. The [[Tennessee State Constitution]] required that senators be at least 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dick|last=Battle|author2=Tom Flake|title=Senate Vote Ousts Fulton|work=Nashville Banner|date=5 January 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than hold a new election, the previous incumbent, [[Clifford Allen]], was allowed to resume his office for another term. Fulton went on to win the next State Senate election in 1956 and was later elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] where he served for 10 years.

In 1964, [[Jed Johnson Jr.|Congressman Jed Johnson Jr.]] of Oklahoma was elected to the [[89th United States Congress|89th Congress]] in the 1964 election while still aged 24 years. However, he became [[Passive suffrage|eligible]] for the House after turning 25 on his birthday, 27 December 1964, seven days before his swearing in, making him the youngest ''legally'' elected and seated member of the United States Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress - Retro Member details|url=https://bioguideretro.congress.gov/Home/MemberDetails?memIndex=J000151|access-date=25 June 2020|website=bioguideretro.congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
                                                                                                                                                                    
In South Carolina, two Senators aged 24 were elected, but were too young according to the State Constitution: Mike Laughlin in 1969 and [[William Jennings Bryan Dorn|Bryan Dorn]] (later a U.S. congressman) in 1941. They were seated anyway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Brian |first=Jack |title=Senate To Have Ineligible Man |newspaper=Spartanburg Herald |location=Spartanburg, SC |date=11 January 1969 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19690111&amp;id=lHssAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zswEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5135,1580539 |access-date=15 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On several occasions, the [[Socialist Workers Party (USA)]] has nominated candidates too young to qualify for the offices they were running for. In 1972, [[Linda Jenness]] ran as the SWP presidential candidate, although she was 31 at the time. Since the U.S. Constitution requires that the President and Vice President be at least 35 years old, Jenness was not able to receive [[ballot access]] in several states in which she otherwise qualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jo|last=Freeman|title=We Will Be Heard: Women's Struggles for Political Power in the United States|url=https://archive.org/details/wewillbeheardwom0000free|url-access=registration|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2008|quote=Only 31, Linda Jenness did not meet the Constitutional age requirement to hold the office of President, but the SWP was on the ballot in 25 states — six more than in 1968.|page=[https://archive.org/details/wewillbeheardwom0000free/page/91 91]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this handicap, Jenness still received 83,380 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1972 Presidential General Election Results|work=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1972&amp;minper=0|access-date=28 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the SWP nominated [[Arrin Hawkins]] as the party's vice-presidential candidate, although she was 28 at the time. Hawkins was also unable to receive ballot access in several states due to her age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presidency 2004 |url=http://www.politics1.com/swp04.htm |work=Politics1.com |access-date=16 October 2007 |quote=Since they weren't going to be elected anyways, the Socialist Workers Party didn't care that they nominated a ticket entirely ineligible to be elected. Why? Because Róger Calero is both foreign born and also not a US citizen; and Arrin Hawkins is too young. To avoid [[ballot access]] problems for the SWP, as the constitutional ineligibility may also render them unable to be listed on the ballot in some states, the 2000 SWP ticket of James Harris for President and Margaret Trowe for Vice President are being used in states that will not permit the Calero-Hawkins slate to be listed. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730141140/http://www.politics1.com/swp04.htm |archive-date=30 July 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reform efforts==
In the United States, many groups have attempted to lower age of candidacy requirements in various states. In 1994, [[South Dakota]] voters rejected a ballot measure that would have lowered the age requirements to serve as a State Senator or State Representative from 25 to 18. In 1998, however, they approved a similar [[ballot]] measure that reduced the age requirements for those offices from 25 to 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=South Dakota Age Qualifications for Elected Officials, Amendment H (1998) |url=https://ballotpedia.org/South_Dakota_Age_Qualifications_for_Elected_Officials,_Amendment_H_(1998) |website=Ballotpedia |access-date=24 June 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, [[Oregon]] voters rejected a ballot measure that would have reduced the age requirement to serve as a State Representative from 21 to 18.

During the early 2000s, the [[British Youth Council]] and other groups successfully campaigned to lower age of candidacy requirements in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="byc"&gt;{{cite press release|title=How old is old enough? |publisher=British Youth Council |date=October 2003 |url=http://www.byc.org.uk/downloads/Campaigns/HowOldIsOldEnough.pdf |access-date=16 July 2008 |quote=BYC believes that at the age of 18 a person may hold elected office.

==International standards==
International electoral standards which are defined in the International Public Human Rights Law, allow restricting candidacy on the basis of age. The interpretation of the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights offered by the United Nations Human Rights Committee in the General Comment 25 states "Any conditions which apply to the exercise of the rights protected by article 25 (of the ICCPR) should be based on objective and reasonable criteria. For example, it may be reasonable to require a higher age for election or appointment to particular offices than for exercising the right to vote, which should be available to every adult citizen."&lt;ref&gt;[http://docstore.ohchr.org/SelfServices/FilesHandler.ashx?enc=6QkG1d%2fPPRiCAqhKb7yhsjYoiCfMKoIRv2FVaVzRkMjTnjRO%2bfud3cPVrcM9YR0iue72QY8oFMq1RR28eUM15L6J1AOT2xcs2D4FgEfOt2liQW2PD1ZsA%2b80ZwK8QWtFzkUhNMfDhFSjgtoCvezhWA%3d%3d] OHCHR General Comment 25&lt;/ref&gt;
