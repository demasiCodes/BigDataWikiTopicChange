In many cases, it also determines the age at which a person may be granted [[ballot access]] for an election.

==Controversy surrounding age requirements==

Many [[youth rights]] groups view age of candidacy requirements as unjustified [[Ageism|age discrimination]]. Occasionally people who are younger than the minimum age will run for an office in protest of the requirement (or because they don't know that the requirement exists). On extremely rare occasions, young people have been elected to offices they do not qualify for and have been deemed ineligible to assume the office.

In 1954, [[Richard Fulton]] won election to the [[Tennessee Senate]]. Shortly after being sworn in, Fulton was ousted from office because he was only 27 years old at the time. The [[Tennessee State Constitution]] required that senators be at least 30 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dick|last=Battle|coauthors=Tom Flake|title=Senate Vote Ousts Fulton|work=Nashville Banner|date=January 5, 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than hold a new election, the incumbent, [[Clifford Allen]], was allowed to stay in office for another term. Fulton went on to win the next State Senate election in 1956 and was later elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|US House of Representatives]] where he served for 10 years.

In 2004, [[Arrin Hawkins]] was the vice-presidential candidate of the [[Socialist Workers Party (USA)|Socialist Workers Party]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|U.S. presidential election]]. Because she was younger than 35 years old, she was not able to receive ballot access in several states in which she otherwise qualified.

==Reform efforts==

In the United States many groups have attempted to lower age of candidacy requirements in various states.

In 1994, [[South Dakota]] voters rejected a ballot measure that would have lowered the age requirements to serve as a State Senator or State Congressperson from 25 to 18. In 1998, however, they approved a similar ballot measure that reduced the age requirements for those offices from 25 to 21.

In 2002, [[Oregon]] voters rejected a ballot measure that would have reduced the age requirement to serve as a State Congressperson from 21 to 18.

This age requirement also applies in elections to any individual elective public office; the main example is that of an [[Elected mayors in the United Kingdom|elected mayor]], whether of [[Mayor of London|London]] or a [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local authority]]. There are no higher age requirements for particular positions in public office.
Candidates are required to be aged eighteen on both the day of nomination and the day of the poll.
The age of candidacy was reduced from 21 to 18 in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]] on [[1 January]] [[2007]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2006/20063412.htm The Electoral Administration Act 2006 (Commencement No. 2, Transitional and Savings Provisions) Order 2006], article 3 and Schedule 1(14)(d).&lt;/ref&gt; when [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/60022--f.htm#17 section 17] of the [[Electoral Administration Act|Electoral Administration Act 2006]] entered into force.  The reduction applies to elections to be held on or after [[3 May]] 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, article 6 and Schedule 2(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

Some states have a minimum age requirement to hold any elected office (usually 21 or 18). Most states will not allow ballot access to people who do not meet the age requirement of the office they are running for.
