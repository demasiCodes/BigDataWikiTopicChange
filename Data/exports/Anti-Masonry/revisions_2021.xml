{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''Anti-Masonry''' (alternatively called '''anti-Freemasonry''') is "avowed opposition to [[Freemasonry]]",&lt;ref name= "antimasonrydef"&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' (1979 ed.), p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt; which in some countries and religious groups has led to suppression. However, there is no homogeneous anti-Masonic movement. Anti-Masonry consists of radically differing criticisms from sometimes incompatible groups who are hostile to Freemasonry in some form.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=August 2021}}

==Early anti-Masonic documents==
The earliest&lt;ref&gt;Morris, S. Brent; ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Freemasonry'', Alpha books, 2006, p,203&lt;/ref&gt; anti-Masonic document was a leaflet printed in 1698 by a Presbyterian minister named Winter. It reads:&lt;ref&gt;As quoted by Morris, S. Brent; ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Freemasonry'', Alpha Books, 2006, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Additional information on this pamphlet is available in ''Ars Quatuor Coronatorum'' 55 (1942)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;TO ALL GODLY PEOPLE, In the Citie of London.
Having thought it needful to warn you of the Mischiefs and Evils practiced in the Sight of God by those called Freed Masons, I say take Care lest their Ceremonies and secret Swearings take hold of you; and be wary that none cause you to err from Godliness. For this devilish Sect of Men are Meeters in secret which swear against all without ther Following. They are the Anti Christ which was to come leading Men from Fear of God. For how should Men meet in secret Places and with secret Signs taking Care that none observed them to do the Work of GOD; are not these the Ways of Evil-doers?

Knowing how that God observeth privilly them that sit in Darkness they shall be smitten and the Secrets of their Hearts layed bare. Mingle not among this corrupt People lest you be found so at the World's Conflagration.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Political anti-Masonry ==
Freemasonry has been alleged to hold back its members from fully committing to their nation.&lt;ref name= "cathencpat"&gt;"Another characteristic of Masonic law is that "treason" and "rebellion" against civil authority are declared only political crimes, which affect the good standing of a Brother no more than heresy, and furnish no ground for a Masonic trial." [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09771a.htm Masonry (Freemasonry)] from the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', partially quoting Mackey, ''Jurisprudence'', 509.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics claim that compared to [[Operative Masonry]]'s clear denunciations of treachery,&lt;ref name= "GLE"&gt;"2nd &amp;ndash; You shall be true liegemen to the King of England without any treason or falsehood, and if you know of any that you amend it privily, if you may, or else warn the King and his Council of it by declaring it to his officers."&lt;/ref&gt; Speculative Masonry (Freemasonry after 1723) was far more ambiguous.&lt;ref name="charges"&gt;[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/history/anderson/charges.html II. Of the CIVIL MAGISTRATES supreme and subordinate] "A Mason is a peaceable Subject to the Civil Powers, wherever he resides or works, and is never to be concern'd in Plots and Conspiracies against the Peace and Welfare of the Nation, nor to behave himself undutifully to inferior Magistrates; for as Masonry hath been always injured by War, Bloodshed, and Confusion, so ancient Kings and Princes have been much dispos'd to encourage the Craftsmen, because of their Peaceableness and Loyalty, whereby they practically answer'd the Cavils of their Adversaries, and promoted the Honour of the Fraternity, who ever flourish'd in Times of Peace. So that if a Brother should be a Rebel against the State he is not to be countenanc'd in his Rebellion, however he may be pitied as an unhappy Man; and, if convicted of no other Crime though the loyal Brotherhood must and ought to disown his Rebellion, and give no Umbrage or Ground of political Jealousy to the Government for the time being; they cannot expel him from the Lodge, and his Relation to it remains indefeasible."&lt;/ref&gt; The old ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' alleges that Masonic disapproval of treachery is not on moral grounds but on the grounds of inconvenience to other Masons.&lt;ref name="inconv"&gt;"The brotherhood ought to disown the rebellion, but only in order to preserve the fraternity from annoyance by the civil authorities." from the article [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09771a.htm Masonry (Freemasonry)] in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt; It also argues&lt;ref name="CEFMCh"&gt;"Such language would equally suit every anarchistic movement." [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09771a.htm Masonry (Freemasonry)] in the ''Catholic Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; that the adage "Loyalty to freedom overrides all other considerations"&lt;ref name="FMch"&gt;"If we were to assert that under no circumstances had a Mason been found willing to take arms against a bad government, we should only be declaring that, in trying moments, when duty, in the masonic sense, to state means antagonism to the Government, they had failed in the highest and most sacred duty of a citizen. Rebellion in some cases is a sacred duty, and none, but a bigot or a fool, will say, that our countrymen were in the wrong, when they took arms against King James II. Loyalty to freedom in a case of this kind overrides all other considerations, and when to rebel means to be free or to perish, it would be idle to urge that a man must remember obligations which were never intended to rob him of his status of a human being and a citizen." "Freemason's Chronicle" 1875, I, 81, quoted as footnote [89] in [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09771a.htm Masonry (Freemasonry)] in the ''Catholic Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; justifies treason, and quotes [[Albert Mackey]], who said "... if treason or rebellion were masonic crimes, almost every mason in the United Colonies (America), in 1776, would have been subject to expulsion and every Lodge to a forfeiture of its warrant by the Grand Lodges of England and Scotland, under whose jurisdiction they were at the time".&lt;ref name= "cathencpat"/&gt;

Freemasonry, however, charges its members that: "In the state you are to be a quiet and peaceful subject, true to your government and just to your country; You are not to countenence disloyalty or rebellion, but patiently submit to legal authority and conform with cheerfulness to the government of the country in which you live."&lt;ref&gt;Webb, Thomas Smith; [https://books.google.com/books?id=7FrMR3dtgDwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Freemasonry+Webb&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U12X8JycSas2h1UcDzwniKTT6se1A#PPA43,M1 ''Freemason's Monitor Or Illustrations of Freemasonry''] – Charge at initiation into the first degree, p. 43 (originally published 1818... republished by Kessinger Publishing, 1995 {{ISBN|1-56459-553-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-56459-553-9}})&lt;/ref&gt;

With this charge in mind, American Freemasons are consistent advocates of the US Constitution, including the [[separation of church and state]],&lt;ref name="sepchustate"&gt;"Freemasonry Does Not Support any particular political position. It has long stood for separation of Church and State, and has been a champion of Free Public Education." From a [http://www.arkmason.com/didknow.htm speech given by Bill Jones] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215084757/http://www.arkmason.com/didknow.htm |date=2006-02-15}} Grand Master of Arkansas, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; which was seen by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as a veiled attack on the Church's place in public life.&lt;ref name="etsi4"&gt;[[Pope Leo XIII]] [http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/L13ITL.HTM ''Etsi Nos'' (On Conditions in Italy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|William Morgan (anti-Mason)|Anti-Masonic Party}}
In 1826, [[William Morgan (anti-Mason)|William Morgan]] disappeared from the small town of Batavia, New York. He was presumed to be kidnapped by Freemasons&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, Jasper;''The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society'', pp. 180-181 (Arcade Publishing 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; and murdered after threatening to expose Freemasonry's "secrets" by publishing its rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Finney, Charles Grandison; [http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupid?key=olbp33154 ''The Character, Claims, and Practical Workings of Freemasonry''].&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan's disappearance sparked a series of protests and suspicion against Freemasonry, which eventually spread to the political realm. Under the leadership of anti-Masonic [[Thurlow Weed]], an Anti-Jacksonist movement became (since [[Andrew Jackson|Jackson]] was a Mason) the [[Anti-Masonic Party]]. This political Party ran presidential candidates in 1828 and 1832, but by 1835 the party had disbanded everywhere except [[Pennsylvania]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[William A. Palmer]] of Vermont and [[Joseph Ritner]] of Pennsylvania were both elected governor of their respective states on anti-Masonic platforms.

[[John Quincy Adams]], President of the United States during the Morgan affair, later declared, objecting to the oath of secrecy, in particular to keeping undefined secrets, and to the penalties for breaking the oath, "Masonry ought forever to be abolished. It is wrong - essentially wrong - a seed of evil which can never produce any good."&lt;ref&gt;Adams, John Quincy [https://archive.org/details/lettersonmasoni00adamgoog Letters on the Masonic Institution], p. 68-71, 1847

In 1938, a Japanese representative to the [[Ulrich Fleischhauer|''Welt-Dienst'' / ''World-Service'']] congress hosted by [[Ulrich Fleischhauer]] stated, on behalf of [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], that "[[Judeo-Masonry]] is forcing the Chinese to turn [[Republic of China (1912–49)|China]] into a spearhead for an attack on Japan, and thereby forcing Japan to defend itself against this threat.

==== Fascist Italy ====
[[Benito Mussolini]] decreed in 1924 that every member of his [[Fascist Party]] who was a Mason must abandon either one or the other organization, and in 1925, he dissolved Freemasonry in Italy, claiming that it was a political organization. One of the most prominent Fascists, General [[Luigi Capello|Capello]], who had also been Deputy Grand Master of the Grande Oriente, Italy's leading [[Grand Lodge]], gave up his membership in the Fascist Party rather than in Masonry. He was later arrested on false charges and sentenced to 30 years in jail.&lt;ref name="TTISTF"&gt;'The Truth Is Stranger Than Fiction', Alphonse Cerza, published by the Masonic Service Association, September 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the dictatorship of the proletariat, leaders of the counter-revolution such as [[Miklós Horthy]] blamed the Hungarian freemasons for their First World War defeat and for the revolution. Masonry was outlawed by a decree in 1920. This marked the start of raids by army officers on Masonic lodges&lt;ref name="L. Nagy Zsuzsa"&gt;L.

Several Masonic buildings were seized and used for anti-Masonic exhibitions. The masonic documents were archived, preserved and may still be used for research.

In post-war Hungary, lodges were re-established, but after five years,&lt;ref name="L. Nagy Zsuzsa"/&gt; the government described them as "meeting places of the enemies of the people's democratic republic, of capitalistic elements, and of the adherents of Western imperialism".

Freemasons are consistently considered an ideological foe of [[Nazism]] in their world perception (''[[Weltauffassung]]''). The Nazis claimed that high-degree Masons were willing members of the Jewish conspiracy and that Freemasonry was one of the causes of Germany's defeat in [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Art DeHoyos and S.

He continued, "The general pacifistic paralysis of the national instinct of self-preservation begun by Freemasonry" is then transmitted to the masses of society by the press.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adolf Hitler]], ''Mein Kampf'', pages 315 and 320.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933 [[Hermann Göring]], the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] President and one of the key figures in the process of ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' ("[[synchronising|synchronization]]"), stated "in National Socialist Germany, there is no place for Freemasonry".&lt;ref name="mercury" /&gt;

The [[Enabling Act]] (''Ermächtigungsgesetz'' in [[German language|German]]) was passed by Germany's parliament (the Reichstag) on March 23, 1933. Using the Act, on January 8, 1934, the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Ministry of the Interior]] ordered the disbandment of Freemasonry, and confiscation of the property of all Lodges; stating that those who had been members of Lodges when Hitler came to power, in January 1933, were prohibited from holding office in the [[Nazi party]] or its [[paramilitary]] arms, and were ineligible for appointment in public service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalsozialismus.de/index.php?

During the war, Freemasonry was banned by edict in all countries that were either allied with the Nazis or under Nazi control, including [[Norway]] and [[France]]. Anti-Masonic exhibitions were held in many occupied countries.

In 1943, the Propaganda Abteilung, a delegation of Nazi Germany's propaganda ministry within [[occupied France]], commissioned the propaganda film ''[[Forces occultes]]''. The film virulently denounces Freemasonry, parliamentarianism and Jews as part of Vichy's drive against them and seeks to prove a Jewish-Masonic plot. The Freemasons was accused of conspiring with Jews and Anglo-American nations to encourage France into a war with Germany.

It is claimed that the dictator [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] ordered the abolition of Freemasonry in Spain.&lt;ref name="primo"&gt;

Following the military coup of 1936, many Freemasons trapped in areas under Nationalist control were arrested and summarily killed in the [[White Terror (Spain)]], along with members of left wing parties and trade unionists. It was reported that Masons were tortured, [[garrote]]d, shot, and murdered by organized death squads in every town in Spain. At this time one of the most rabid opponents of Freemasonry, Father [[Juan Tusquets Terrats]], began to work for the Nationalists with the task of exposing masons. One of his close associates was Franco's personal chaplain, and over the next two years, these two men assembled a huge index of 80,000 suspected masons, even though there were little more than 5,000 masons in Spain. The lodge building in Cordoba was burnt, the [[Masonic Temple of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] in the [[Canary Islands]] was confiscated and transformed into the headquarters of the Falange, and another was shelled by artillery. In Salamanca thirty members of one lodge were shot, including a priest. Similar atrocities occurred across the country: fifteen masons were shot in Logrono, seventeen in Ceuta, thirty-three in Algeciras, and thirty in Valladolid, among them the Civil Governor. Few towns escaped the carnage as Freemasons in Lugo, Zamora, Cadiz and Granada were brutally rounded up and shot, and in Seville, the entire membership of several lodges were butchered. The slightest suspicion of being a mason was often enough to earn a place in a firing squad, and the blood-letting was so fierce that, reportedly, some masons were even hurled into working engines of steam trains. By 16 December 1937, according to the annual masonic assembly held in Madrid, all masons that had not escaped from the areas under nationalist control had been murdered.&lt;ref name="freemasonrytoday.com"/&gt;

After the victory of dictator General [[Francisco Franco]], Freemasonry was officially outlawed in Spain on 2 March 1940.

Freemasonry was formally outlawed in the Law for the Repression of Freemasonry and Communism.&lt;ref name="Ruiz, Julius p. 25"&gt;Ruiz, Julius, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sNk61qkjop0C&amp;dq Franco's justice: repression in Madrid after the Spanish Civil War], p. 25 Oxford Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt; After Franco's decree outlawing masonry, Franco's supporters were given two months to resign from any lodge they might be a member. Many masons chose to go into exile instead, including prominent monarchists who had whole-heartedly supported the Nationalist rebellion in 1936. The common components in Spanish Masonry seems to have been upper or middle class conservative liberalism and strong anti-clericism.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Thomas, The Spanish Civil War, Penguin, 1965 p. 47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law for the Repression of Freemasonry and Communism was not abrogated until 1963.&lt;ref name="Ruiz, Julius p. 25"/&gt; References to a "Judeo-Masonic plot" are a standard component of Francoist speeches and propaganda and reveal the intense and paranoid obsession of the dictator with masonry. Franco produced at least 49 pseudonymous anti-masonic magazine articles and an anti-masonic book during his lifetime. According to Franco:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;
:The whole secret of the campaigns unleashed against Spain can be explained in two words: masonry and communism... we have to extirpate these two evils from our land.

It was the [[Unlawful Societies Act]] of 1799 that saw the first statute "for the more effectual suppression of societies established for seditious and treasonable purposes"; once enacted it affected all societies whose members were required to take an oath not authorised by law, shall be deemed "unlawful combinations." It was as a result of the intervention of the Grand Master of the Antients, The 4th Duke of Atholl, and the Acting Grand Master of the Moderns, the earl of Moira that a special exempting clause was inserted into this legislation in favour of societies "held under the Denomination of Lodges of Freemasons" provided that they had been "usually held before the Act" and their names, places and times of meeting and the names of the members were annually registered with the local Clerk to the Justices of the Peace. This continued on until 1967 when this Act was repealed by a section of the Criminal Justice Act which meant that the annual returns of all the Lodges to the authorities ceased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/prescott15.html Pietre Stones] The Unlawful Societies Act of 1799, Dr Andrew Prescott, retrieved 13th July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries with a significant Muslim population do not allow Masonic establishments within their jurisdictions. After [[World War II]], while under the [[Mandatory Iraq|British Mandate]], Iraq used to have several lodges. This all changed with the [[14 July Revolution]] in 1958, however, with the abolition of the [[Hashemite]] [[Monarchy]] and Iraq's declaration as a republic. The licenses permitting lodges to meet were rescinded, and later, laws were introduced banning any further meetings. This position was later reinforced under [[Saddam Hussein]]. In 1980, the Iraqi legal and penal code was changed, making it a [[felony]] to "promote or acclaim [[Zionism|Zionist]] principles, including freemasonry, or who associate [themselves] with Zionist organizations."&lt;ref name="freemasonryinSHIraq"&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/jul/1/20040701-120129-6565r/?page=all "Saddam to be formally charged"], ''The Washington Times'', July 1, 2004.

=== Christian anti-Masonry ===
{{Main|Opposition to Freemasonry within Christianity}}
One of the first highly vocal Christian critics of freemasonry was [[Charles Finney]]. In his book ''The Character, Claims, and Practical Workings of Freemasonry'', Finney not only ridicules the masons but also explains why he viewed leaving the society as an essential act three years after entering seminary.

A number of [[Protestant]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] denominations discourage their congregants from joining Masonic lodges, although this differs in intensity according to the denomination. Some simply express mild concern as to whether Freemasonry is compatible with Christianity while, at the other extreme, some accuse the fraternity of outright [[devil worship]], by quoting the writings of [[Leo Taxil]] and [[Abel Clarin de la Rive]].&lt;ref&gt;Is It True What They Say About Freemasonry? Authors: de Hoyos, Arturo and Morris, S. Brent, 1988, 2nd edition, p. 27-36, Leo Taxil: The Hoax of Luciferian Masonry {{ISBN|1590771532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] has, since 1738, prohibited membership in Masonic organizations, citing both political and religious reasons. Until 1983 the penalty for Catholics who joined the fraternity was [[excommunication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05678a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Excommunication|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time the punishment has been an [[interdict]], barring the offender from [[Holy Communion]]. Although the canonical penalty changed in 1983, the prohibition on membership has not.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, Prefect. [https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19831126_declaration-masonic_en.html ''Declaration on Masonic Associations''] Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, 26 November 1983. Accessed 2011-10-09. "Therefore the Church's negative judgment in regard to Masonic association[s] remains unchanged since their principles have always been considered irreconcilable with the doctrine of the Church and therefore membership in them remains forbidden. The faithful who enrol in Masonic associations are in a state of grave sin and may not receive Holy Communion. It is not within the competence of local ecclesiastical authorities to give a judgment on the nature of Masonic associations which would imply a derogation from what has been decided above..."&lt;/ref&gt;
