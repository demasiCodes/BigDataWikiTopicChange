Anti-Masonry consists of radically differing criticisms from sometimes incompatible groups who are hostile to Freemasonry in some form.

==Origin==
Matthias Pöhlmann of the Protestant Centre for Religious and Ideological Issues of the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] refers&lt;ref name="EZW"&gt;Matthias Pöhlmann: ''Verschwiegene Männer'', Protestant Centre for Religious and Ideological Issues of the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]]&lt;/ref&gt; to the political scientist [[:de:Armin Pfahl-Traughber|prof. Dr. Armin Pfahl-Traughber]]&lt;ref name="Pfahl-Traughber"&gt;prof. Dr. Pfahl-Traughber: ''Der antisemitisch-antifreimaurerische Verschwörungsmythos''&lt;/ref&gt; that the first Anti-Masonic conspiracy myth was brought up in Germany.&lt;ref name="Pöhlmann"&gt;Matthias Pöhlmann referring to [[:de:Armin Pfahl-Traughber|Dr. Armin Pfahl-Traughber]]&lt;ref name="Pfahl-Traughber" /&gt;: „Der Freimaurer-Verschwörungsmythos wurde in Deutschland aufgebracht.“&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pöhlmann, an anonymous written book in 1786 called ''Enthüllungen des Systems der Weltbürger-Politik'' (“Disclosure of the System of Cosmopolitan Politics”) was published. Its author was an employee of the Weimar city government, Ernst August von Göchhausen (1740–1824)&lt;ref name="Pfahl-Traughber" /&gt;. He described a horrorful image of a cosmopolitan conspiracy of Freemasons, Illuminati and Jesuits and predicts unavoidable revolutions to the world&lt;ref name="EZW" /&gt;. This was three years before the French Revolution and seemed to confirm his prophecies, so the Anti-Masonic conspiracy became a powerful weapon of propaganda&lt;ref name="EZW" /&gt;. Freemasons were accused to be the driving force of the destruction of the social system and the alliance between Throne and church&lt;ref name="EZW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Biberstein"&gt;Dr. Johannes Rogalla von Biberstein, historian and librarian of the University of Bielefeld: ''Die These von der Verschwörung 1776–1945. Philosophen, Freimaurer, Juden, Liberale und Sozialisten gegen die Sozialordnung'', Flensburg 1992&lt;/ref&gt;. Supporters of the Anti-Masonic conspiracy theories were especially christian counterrevolutionaries&lt;ref name="EZW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Biberstein" /&gt; who saw Freemasons behind every force against the social system.&lt;ref name="EZW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Biberstein" /&gt; Their main goal of the defamation campaign against Freemasonry was the expansion of Liberalism and Socialism, religious tolerance and the enlightening rationalism.&lt;ref name="EZW" /&gt; Until the 19th century this affect dominated the Anti-Masonic publications.

==Political Anti-Masonry==
===American Political Anti-Masonry (1830s-1850s)===
{{main|William Morgan (anti-Mason)|Anti-Masonic Party}}

In 1826, [[William Morgan (anti-Mason)|William Morgan]] disappeared from the small town of Batavia, New York, after threatening to expose Freemasonry's "secrets" by publishing its rituals.  His disappearance caused some Anti-masons to claim that he had been kidnapped, and murdered, by Masons. Morgan's disappearance sparked a series of protests against Freemasonry, which eventually spread to the political realm.  Under the leadership of anti-Masonic [[Thurlow Weed]], an [[Andrew Jackson|Anti-Jacksonist]] movement became (since Jackson was a Mason) the  [[Anti-Masonic Party]]. This political Party ran presidential candidates in [[1828]] and [[1832]], but by [[1835]] the party had disbanded everywhere except [[Pennsylvania]].

===British Political Anti-Masonry (1990s-current)===
Since 1997, several members of the British Government have attempted to pass laws requiring Freemasons who join the police or judiciary.&lt;ref name="Newjudgesmustdeclaremasonicmembership"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk/politics/57381.stm "New judges must declare masonic membership"], BBC, March 5, 1998, retrieved Feb 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; to declare their membership publicly to the government amid accusations of Freemasons performing acts of mutual advancement and favor-swapping. This movement was initially led by [[Jack Straw (politician)|Jack Straw]], [[Home Secretary]] from 1997 until 2001.&lt;ref name="Newjudgesmustdeclaremasonicmembership" /&gt; In 1999, the [[Welsh Assembly]] became the only body in the United Kingdom to place a legal requirement on membership declaration for Freemasons.&lt;ref name="Freemasonpolicyreviewdue"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/1699189.stm "Freemason policy review due
"], BBC, Dec 8, 2001, retrieved Feb 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, existing members of the police and judiciary in England are asked to voluntarily admit to being Freemasons.&lt;ref name="HouseofCommonsresponce"&gt; [http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050721/text/50721w69.htm "House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 21 Jul 2005 (pt 69) "], UK House of Commons, July 21, 2005, retrieved Feb 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; However, all first time successful judiciary candidates "must declare their freemasonry status" before appointment.&lt;ref name="HouseofCommonsresponce" /&gt; Conversely, new members of the police are not required to declare their status.&lt;ref name="HouseofCommonsresponce" /&gt;

In 2004, [[Rhodri Morgan]], the [[First Minister of Wales|First Minister of the Welsh Assembly]], said that he blocked Gerard Elias' appointment to counsel general because of links to hunting and freemasonry&lt;ref name="Morgancriticisedoverjobblocking"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/3557279.stm "Morgan criticised over job blocking"], BBC, March 22, 2004, retrieved Feb 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;, although it was claimed by non-Labour politicians that the real reason was in order to have a Labour supporter, Malcolm Bishop, in the role.&lt;ref name="mbishop"&gt;"Mr Morgan wanted another QC, Malcolm Bishop, who has stood as a Labour candidate and is a close associate of former Lord Chancellor Derry Irvine." [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/3530987.stm Morgan 'blocked' QC appointment]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persecution and Holocaust under Totalitarian Regimes===
{{main|Freemasonry under Totalitarian Regimes}}
{{see also|Freemasonry|Holocaust}}

In the [[twentieth century]] [[totalitarian]] regimes, both [[Fascist]] and [[Communist]], have treated Freemasonry as a potential source of opposition. Masonic writers state that the language used by the totalitarian regimes is similar to that used by some modern critics of Freemasonry.&lt;ref name="bessel.tolalitarian"&gt;Bigotry and the Murder of Freemasonry, Paul M. Bessel, 1994, [http://bessel.org/naziartl.htm 'Bigotry and the Murder of Freemasonry'] - "These people who attack Masonry with exaggerated language, and without accepting reasonable explanations of what Freemasonry really is, would probably say that their use of language about Masonry that is strikingly similar to that which was used by the Nazis and other vicious attackers of Freemasonry in the past does not mean that they are following in the footsteps of the Nazis."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[image:Red_Triangle.png|right|60px]]
Consistently considered an ideological foe of [[Nazism]] in their world perception (''Weltauffassung''), Freemasonic Concentration Camp inmates were graded as “Political” prisoners, and wore an inverted (point down) ''[[Nazi concentration camp badges|red triangle]]''. &lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of the Holocaust'', volume 2, page 531, citing Katz, ''Jews and Freemasons in Europe''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The number of Freemasons from Nazi occupied countries who were killed is not accurately known, &lt;ref name="HMD home"/&gt; but it is estimated that between 80,000 and 200,000 Freemasons perished under the Nazi regime. &lt;ref name="holocaust"&gt;Freemasons for Dummies, by [http://members.aol.com/brlodge/whymasons.html Christopher Hodapp], Wiley Publishing Inc., Indianapolis, 2005, p.85, sec. ''Hitler and the Nazi''&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[United Kingdom]] Government established [[Holocaust Memorial Day (UK)|Holocaust Memorial Day]] &lt;ref name="HMD home"/&gt; to recognise all groups who were targets of the Nazi regime, and counter [[Holocaust denial]].

===Iraqi Baathist Anti-Masonry===
In 1980, the Iraqi legal and penal code was changed by [[Saddam Hussein]] and the ruling [[Ba'ath Party]], thereby making it a felony to "promote or acclaim Zionist principles, including freemasonry, or who associate [themselves] with Zionist organizations."&lt;ref name="freemasonryinSHIraq"&gt;[http://washingtontimes.com/world/20040701-120129-6565r.htm "Saddam to be formally charged"], The Washington Times, 2004, retrieved March 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freemasonry and Patriotism===
Freemasonry is often alleged to hold back its members from fully committing to their nation&lt;ref name"cathencpat"&gt;"Another characteristic of Masonic law is that "treason" and "rebellion" against civil authority are declared only political crimes, which affect the good standing of a Brother no more than heresy, and furnish no ground for a Masonic trial." [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09771a.htm Masonry (Freemasonry)] from the Catholic Encyclopedia, partially quoting Mackey, "Jurisprudence", 509.&lt;/ref&gt;. Critics claim that compared to Operative Masonry's clear denunciations of treachery&lt;ref name="GLE"&gt;"2nd -- You shall be true liegemen to the King of England without any treason or falsehood, and if you know of any that you amend it privily, if you may, or else warn the King and his Council of it by declaring it to his officers."&lt;/ref&gt; Masonry after 1723 (Speculative masonry) was far more ambiguous&lt;ref name="charges"&gt;[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/history/anderson/charges.html II. Of the CIVIL MAGISTRATES supreme and subordinate] "A Mason is a peaceable Subject to the Civil Powers, wherever he resides or works, and is never to be concern'd in Plots and Conspiracies against the Peace and Welfare of the Nation, nor to behave himself undutifully to inferior Magistrates; for as Masonry hath been always injured by War, Bloodshed, and Confusion, so ancient Kings and Princes have been much dispos'd to encourage the Craftsmen, because of their Peaceableness and Loyalty, whereby they practically answer'd the Cavils of their Adversaries, and promoted the Honour of the Fraternity, who ever flourish'd in Times of Peace. So that if a Brother should be a Rebel against the State he is not to be countenanc'd in his Rebellion, however he may be pitied as an unhappy Man; and, if convicted of no other Crime though the loyal Brotherhood must and ought to disown his Rebellion, and give no Umbrage or Ground of political Jealousy to the Government for the time being; they cannot expel him from the Lodge, and his Relation to it remains indefeasible."&lt;/ref&gt;. It is alleged in the Catholic Encyclopedia that Masonic disapproval of treachery is not on moral grounds but on the grounds of inconvenience to other Masons.&lt;ref name="inconv"&gt;"The brotherhood ought to disown the rebellion, but only in order to preserve the fraternity from annoyance by the civil authorities." from the article [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09771a.htm Masonry (Freemasonry)] in the Catholic Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' argues&lt;ref name="CEFMCh"&gt;"Such language would equally suit every anarchistic movement." [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09771a.htm Masonry (Freemasonry)] in the Catholic Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; that the adage "Loyalty to freedom overrides all other considerations" &lt;ref name="FMch"&gt;"If we were to assert that under no circumstances had a Mason been found willing to take arms against a bad government, we should only be declaring that, in trying moments, when duty, in the masonic sense, to state means antagonism to the Government, they had failed in the highest and most sacred duty of a citizen. Rebellion in some cases is a sacred duty, and none, but a bigot or a fool, will say, that our countrymen were in the wrong, when they took arms against King James II. Loyalty to freedom in a case of this kind overrides all other considerations, and when to rebel means to be free or to perish, it would be idle to urge that a man must remember obligations which were never intended to rob him of his status of a human being and a citizen. ", "Freemason's Chronicle" 1875, I, 81, quoted as footnote [89] in [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09771a.htm Masonry (Freemasonry)] in the Catholic Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; justifies treason.

American Freemasons are consistent advocates of the US Constitution in [[separation of church and state]]&lt;ref name="sepchustate"&gt;"Freemasonry Does Not Support any particular political position. It has long stood for separation of Church and State, and has been a champion of Free Public Education." From a [http://www.arkmason.com/didknow.htm speech given by Bill Jones] Grand Master of Arkansas, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;, which was seen especially by the Catholic church as a veiled attack on the Church's place in public life.&lt;ref name="etsi4"&gt;[[Pope Leo XIII]] [http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/L13ITL.HTM ETSI NOS (On Conditions in Italy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern conspiracy theories==
{{main|Masonic conspiracy theories}}
Due to its secretive nature Freemasonry has long been a target of [[Conspiracy theories (a collection)|conspiracy theories]] in which it is either bent on world domination or already secretly in control of world politics.

Historically, complaints have been made that the Masons have secretly plotted to create a society based on the revolutionary ideals of [[liberty]], [[social equality|equality]], [[Brotherhood|fraternity]], [[separation of church and state]] and (in Nazi Germany) a Jewish plot for [[Religious toleration|religious tolerance]].&lt;ref name="hitler.religioustolerance"&gt;Mein Kampf, Adolf Hitler, Volume One - A Reckoning 
Chapter XI: Nation and Race , 1924, Translated 1943, [http://www.adolfhitler.ws/lib/books/43kampf/kampf43.htm 'Mein Kampf'] - "Finally, the Jewish influence on economic affairs grows with terrifying speed through the stock exchange. He becomes the owner, or at least the controller, of the national labor force. To strengthen his political position he tries to tear down the racial and civil barriers which for a time continue to restrain him at every step. To this end he fights with all the tenacity innate in him for religious tolerance-and in Freemasonry, which has succumbed to him completely, he has an excellent instrument with which to fight for his aims and put them across. The governing circles and the higher strata of the political and economic bourgeoisie are brought into his nets by the strings of Freemasonry, and never need to suspect what is happening."&lt;/ref&gt; However, in post-[[Age of Enlightenment |Enlightenment]] societies, many people{{fact}} have by now accepted these core Masonic values{{fact}} as a set of overall social values bereft of any Masonic connection.

===Claims that Freemasonry is a Zionist conspiracy===
Some Anti-Masons have been known to claim that Freemasonry is a Jewish front for world domination, or is at least controlled by Jews for this goal. An example of this is the notorious (and fraudulent) [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]. Hitler outlawed Freemasonry partially for this reason.&lt;ref name="hitler.jewscontrolfreemasonry"&gt;Mein Kampf, Adolf Hitler, Volume Two - The National Socialist Movement 
Chapter XIII: German Alliance Policy after the War, 1924, Translated 1943, [http://www.adolfhitler.ws/lib/books/43kampf/kampf43.htm 'Mein Kampf'] - "The fight which Fascist Italy waged against Jewry's three principal weapons, the profound reasons for which may not have been consciously understood (though I do not believe this myself) furnishes the best proof that the poison fangs of that Power which transcends all State boundaries are being drawn, even though in an indirect way. The prohibition of Freemasonry and secret societies, the suppression of the supernational Press and the definite abolition of Marxism, together with the steadily increasing consolidation of the Fascist concept of the State – all this will enable the Italian Government, in the course of some years, to advance more and more the interests of the Italian people without paying any attention to the hissing of the Jewish world-hydra. "&lt;/ref&gt; The covenant of the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas claims that Freemasonry is a "secret society" founded as part of a Zionist plot to control the world.&lt;ref name="Hamas"&gt;[http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/hamas.htm 'The Covenant of the Islamic Resistance Movement (HAMAS)-Palestine'], articles seventeen, twenty-two and twenty-eight, 18 Aug 1988. Retrieved 29 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other conspiracy theories===

*Freemasonry is the [[Illuminati]] or [[New World Order]], and secretly controls all aspects of society and government.&lt;ref name="freedomdomain"&gt;[http://www.freedomdomain.com/freemason.html Freemasons at Freedomdomain.com] and [http://www.freedomdomain.com/neworder.htm New World Order at Freedomdomain.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was satirized in a ''[[Simpsons]]'' episode, "[[Homer the Great]]", featuring an order called the Stonecutters who keep "the Martians under wraps" and "Atlantis off the maps".
*The [[United States]] was founded by Freemasons who have interwoven Masonic symbols into American society, particularly in [[Great Seal of the United States#Significance|national seals]], streets in [[Washington DC]], [[architecture]], and the [[Dollar Bill]].&lt;ref name="watch pair"&gt;[http://watch.pair.com/GW.html This page at watchpair.com] and [http://watch.pair.com/mason.html This other page at watchpair.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=forbidden"&gt;[http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/masonic_symbols_washington.htm Masonic Symbols in Washington]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "seal"&gt;[http://www.geocities.com/endtimedeception/seal.htm The Seal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="secretsocietyindex"&gt; [http://web.archive.org/web/20021201104732/http://www.geocities.com/lord_visionary/secretsocietyindex.htm Secret Society Index]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of how this theory forms has entered popular culture is the blockbuster film thriller [[National Treasure (film)|National Treasure]].
*Modern day politicians are or were once Freemasons, particularly [[George H. W. Bush]].&lt;ref name="famous freemasons"&gt;[http://www.geocities.com/endtimedeception/famous.htm endtimedeception] - it should be noted that, in fact, neither President George H.W. Bush nor President George W. Bush are Masons.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Various figures in popular culture are Freemasons,{{fact}} including movie producers such as [[James Cameron]].&lt;ref name="cameron"&gt;[http://www.mt.net/~watcher/jamescameronconspiracy.html James Cameron Conspiracy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cameron2"&gt;[http://www.geocities.com/mansuedotcom/rspnseml030198a.html The James Cameron Conspiracy Theory]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jack the Ripper]] was a Freemason whose murders resembled Masonic initiation rituals. This is the subject of [[Alan Moore]]'s graphic novel ''[[From Hell]]'', who references various works by other authors with similar claims.
*The September 11 attacks were astrological in nature, as part of a hidden war between Masonry (as descendants of the Knights Templar) and Islam.&lt;ref name="nineeleven"&gt;[http://www.enterprisemission.com/tower2.htm enterprisemission.com/tower2]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The Freemasons were involved in the JFK assassination.  Some conspiracy theorists say that Freemasons had JFK killed,&lt;ref name="JFK"&gt;[http://www.revisionisthistory.org/kingkill33.html JFK]&lt;/ref&gt; others that he was killed for being a Mason (he wasn't one).{{fact}} 
*The Denver airport contains a Freemason symbol and keypad, of unknown purpose.&lt;ref name="dever"&gt;[http://www.geocities.com/baja/5692/ Denver Airport - Expose of Bizzare Influence] and [http://www.masonicinfo.com/denver.htm A page about this theory at masonicinfo.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Freemasonry is responsible for crop circles.&lt;ref name="cropcirc"&gt;[http://www.mt.net/~watcher/telescopecropcircle.html Crop Circles]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Freemasons intertwine various symbols and [[numerology]] into modern culture, such as corporate logos.&lt;ref name="forbidden2"&gt;[http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/13_33_freemason_sig.htm Corporate Logos]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Most Freemasons are unaware of hidden or secretive ruling bodies that govern their organization, conduct occult ritual, or control various positions of power. This is an example of a secret society within a secret society.&lt;ref name="conspiracy"&gt;[http://www.meta-religion.com/Secret_societies/Groups/Masonry/freemansonry_conspiracy_within.htm Freemasonry -Conspiracy Within]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[KKK]],&lt;ref name="kkk"&gt;[http://www.freedomdomain.com/freemason.html Freedomdomain.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Skull and Bones]],&lt;ref name="trosch"&gt;[http://www.trosch.org/bks/msnc/masonry-exposed.html Trosch - Masonry exposed]&lt;/ref&gt; and other organizations&lt;ref name="trosch"&gt;[http://www.trosch.org/bks/msnc/masonry-exposed.html Trosch - Masonry exposed]&lt;/ref&gt; are intimately tied to Freemasonry.
*If a Mason wishes to leave the organization he is killed to prevent the secrets of the brotherhood being revealed.{{fact}}

==Social Anti-Masonry==
===Allegations of cronyism===
Another criticism&lt;ref name"CEnc"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09771a.htm Masonry (Freemasonry)] Catholic Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; is that Freemasons practice [[cronyism]], granting favors to fellow members. For example, many people{{fact}} have the impression that one increases chances for employment or improves one's business by joining the Masons.&lt;ref name="Gypsy"&gt;This is alluded to in the movie ''[[Gypsy: A Musical Fable|Gypsy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Architect Sketch"&gt;Also alluded to in a Monty Python sketch in which an inferior design for a block of flats is selected because the architect is a Mason. [http://www.jumpstation.ca/recroom/comedy/python/arch.html Architect Sketch]&lt;/ref&gt; This allegation, however, is not particular to Masonry; it has been applied to many types of organizations or [[secret society]].{{fact}}

===Criticisms based on the moral faults of known Masons===
Masonry, like any institution with moral overtones,{{fact}} has been criticized for the moral faults of some of their members. Though Masons are generally more hospitable to other Masons, this does not mean that they are above helping unrelated individuals.{{fact}} Some critics also argue that the Freemasons are primarily a social club.{{fact}} Masons respond to these criticisms by pointing out that there are many programs and initiatives sponsored by lodges that do give back to the community at large.&lt;ref name="charities"&gt;Examples include blood drives, child identification programs, and other charitable funds. Neither the [[Shriners Hospitals for Children]] nor the [[Scottish Rite]] Learning Centers are restricted to Masons, and they provide their services free of charge to those who need them. Also, though their numbers are dwindling, there are Masonic Children's Homes throughout the United States. For instance, the Grand Lodge of Georgia directly supports the Masonic Children's Home of Georgia, which offers its services to children free of charge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious Anti-Masonry==
===Christian Anti-Masonry===
{{main|Christianity and Freemasonry}}
{{main|Catholicism and Freemasonry}}

A number of Protestant and Eastern Orthodox denominations discourage their congregants from joining Masonic lodges, although this differs in intensity according to the denomination.  The [[Roman Catholic Church]] has often been seen to be in conflict with Freemasonry, which it sees as tending to [[anticlericalism]] and [[deism]]. The Church [[Catholicism_and_Freemasonry#Ban_on_Membership|forbids]] [[Catholics]] from becoming Freemasons - on pain of [[excommunication]]. Freemasonry allows Roman Catholics to become members.
