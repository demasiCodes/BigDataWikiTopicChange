[[Allen Jones]]' sculptures ''Hat Stand'' and ''Table Sculpture'', made in [[1969]], which show semi-naked women in the roles of furniture, are clear examples of the depiction of the fantasy of sexual objectification. (This particular interest, a form of [[sexual bondage]] that involves making furniture designed to incorporate a bound person, is also known as "[[forniphilia]]".) 

Some [[feminist]]s have long argued that [[traditional attitudes to women]] in many societies constitute non-consensual sexual objectification of women. 

A desire to be objectified occurs in many men and women's [[masochistic]] sexual fantasies.
Objectification for fetishistic purposes may provide [[erotic humiliation]] for the person so regarded, whether male or female. As with most sexual activities, it is generally viewed as abusive if it is not part of a consensual arrangement, such as in [[BDSM]] play.
