'''Sexual objectification''' is the act of treating a person as a mere [[Object (philosophy)|object]] of [[sexual desire]]. [[Objectification]] more broadly means treating a person as a [[commodity]] or an object without regard to their [[personality]] or [[dignity]]. Objectification is most commonly examined at the level of a society, but can also refer to the behavior of individuals and is a type of [[dehumanization]].

Although both males and females can be sexually objectified, the objectification of [[woman|women]] is an important idea in many [[feminism|feminist]] theories and psychological theories derived from them. Sexual objectification of girls and women contributes to [[gender inequality]], and many psychologists associate objectification with a host of physical and mental health risks in women.

The objection to the objectification of women is not a recent phenomenon. In the French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], for example, there was a debate as to whether a woman's breasts were merely a sensual enticement or rather a natural gift. In [[Alexandre Guillaume Mouslier de Moissy]]'s 1771 play ''The True Mother'' (''La Vraie Mère''), the title character rebukes her husband for treating her as merely an object for his sexual gratification: "Are your senses so gross as to look on these breasts &amp;ndash; the respectable treasures of nature &amp;ndash; as merely an embellishment, destined to ornament the chest of women?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schama |first=Simon |author-link=Simon Schama |contribution=The cultural construction of a citizen: II Casting roles: children of nature |editor-last=Schama |editor-first=Simon |editor-link=Simon Schama |title=Citizens: a chronicle of the French Revolution |publisher=Knopf Distributed by Random House |location=New York |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-394-55948-3|title-link=Citizens. A Chronicle of the French Revolution }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issues concerning sexual objectification became first [[problematization|problemized]] during the 1970s by feminist groups. Since then, it has been argued that the phenomenon of female sexual objectification has increased drastically since its problematization in all levels of life, and has resulted in negative consequences for women, especially in the political sphere. However, a rising form of new third-waver feminist groups have also taken the increased objectification of women as an opportunity to use the female body as a mode of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Heldman | first = Caroline | title = Sexualizing Sarah Palin: the social and political context of the sexual objectification of female candidates | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 65 | issue = 3 | pages = 156&amp;ndash;164 | doi = 10.1007/s11199-011-9984-6 | date = August 2011 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that the feminist movement itself has contributed to the problem of the sexual objectification of women by promoting  "free" love (i.e. men and women choosing to have non-reproductive sex outside of marriage and for their own pleasure).&lt;ref name=fredrickson2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Abrams |first1=Dominic |last2=Hogg |first2=Michael A. |contribution=Collective identity: group membership and self-conception |editor-last1=Brewer |editor-first1=Marilynn B. |editor-last2=Hewstone |editor-first2=Miles |editor-link1=Marilynn B.

===Female self-objectification===

[[Ariel Levy (journalist)|Ariel Levy]] contends that Western women who exploit their sexuality by, for example, wearing revealing clothing and engaging in lewd behavior, engage in female self-objectification, meaning they objectify themselves. While some women see such behaviour as a form of [[empowerment]], Levy contends that it has led to greater emphasis on a physical criterion or [[sexualization]] for women's perceived self-worth, which Levy calls "[[Raunch aesthetics|raunch culture]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy |first=Ariel |author-link=Ariel Levy (journalist) |title=Female chauvinist pigs: women and the rise of raunch culture |publisher=Pocket Books |location=London |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-4165-2638-4|title-link=Female Chauvinist Pigs }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levy discusses this phenomenon in ''[[Female Chauvinist Pigs]]: Women and the Rise of Raunch Culture''. Levy followed the camera crew from the ''[[Girls Gone Wild (franchise)|Girls Gone Wild]]'' video series, and argues that contemporary America's sexualized culture not only objectifies women, it encourages women to objectify themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/article2523264.ece |work=The Times |location=London |title=Yes we are bovvered |first=Ginny |last=Dougary |date=25 September 2007 |accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In today's culture, Levy writes, the idea of a woman participating in a wet T-shirt contest or being comfortable watching explicit [[pornography]] has become a symbol of feminist strength.

[[Jordan Peterson]] has asked why women need to wear make-up or high-heels in the workplace, that a double standard exists for sexual harassment and females who self-objectify themselves in society.&lt;ref&gt;https://studybreaks.com/news-politics/jordan-peterson-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual objectification of men==
===General===
Male sexual objectification involves a man being viewed primarily as an object of sexual desire, rather than as a whole person. [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] and [[Naomi Wolf]] write that women's sexual liberation led women to a [[role reversal]], whereby they viewed men as sex objects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last=Sommers |first=Christina |author-link=Sommers, Christina Hoff |contribution=The gender wardens |title-link=Who Stole Feminism?

=== Media ===
Men's bodies have become more objectified than they previously were. It is known as "Six-pack Advertising," where men are seen as sexual objects. Because of society's established gaze on the objectification of women, the newfound objectification of men is not as widespread. Even with this increase of male objectification, males are still seen as the dominant figures and so the focus is still primarily on women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Tortajada-Giménez |first1= Iolanda |last2= Araüna-Baró |first2= Núria | last3 = Martínez-Martínez | first3 = Inmaculada José | title = Advertising stereotypes and gender representation in social networking sites | journal = Comunicar | volume = 21 | issue = 41 | pages = 177&amp;ndash;186 | date = 2013 | url = https://www.revistacomunicar.com/indice-en/articulo.php?numero=41-2013-17 | ref = harv |doi= 10.3916/C41-2013-17 }} [https://doi.org/10.3916/C41-2013-17 Original Spanish article.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Male sexual objectification has been found in 37% of advertisements featuring men's body parts to showcase a product.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davidson | first1 = M.

Similar to the issues of sexual objectification in women, it is common for said objectification to lead men to body shaming, eating disorders, and a drive for perfection. The continued exposure of these "ideal" men subject society to expect all men to fit this role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Buchbinder | first = David | author-link = David Buchbinder | title = Object or ground?

Male actors featured in TV shows and movies are oftentimes in excellent shape and have the "ideal" bodies. These men often fill the leading roles. When society is subjected to men who do not have ideal bodies, we typically see them as the comic relief. It is rare to see an out of shape man have a leading role. "There are temporal, cultural and geographical ‘norms’ of gender and other aspects of identity, which are often incorrectly considered to be inherent or natural."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dawson | first = Leanne | title = Passing and policing: controlling compassion, bodies and boundaries in ''Boys Don't Cry'' and ''Unveiled/Fremde Haut'' | journal = Studies in European Cinema | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 205&amp;ndash;228 | doi = 10.1080/17411548.2015.1094258 | date = 2015 | ref = harv | url = https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/22121834/Dawson_SEC_2015_Passing_and_Policing.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the media, the ideal version of a man is seen as a strong, toned man. The idealized version of a woman is thin (Aubrey, pg. 7). The concept of body evaluation is more common in criticizing women. However, body evaluation revolves more towards nonverbal cues for men. It is more common in women because sexual, sometimes offensive, verbal remarks are directed towards women. Men, on the other hand, experience more body evaluation through gazing and other nonverbal cues. Gazing is simply the way in which depict men from an idealized perspective. Men tend to experience this from other men, whereas women experience it from both sexes.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The Interpersonal Sexual Objectification Scale (ISOS) is a scale that shows sexual objectification of respondents, both men and women. While experiencing sexual objectification it creates the need to constantly maintain and critique one's physical appearance. This leads to other things like eating disorders, body shaming, and anxiety. The ISOS scale can be related to objectification theory and sexism.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Self-objectification, which is the way in which we evaluate ourselves, is concentrated more on women.  Men typically experience it through media display.  The difference is that men typically do not experience the negative effects to the extent that women do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stevens Aubrey | first = Jennifer |title=Investigating the role of self-objectification in the relationship between media exposure and sexual self-perceptions | url = http://www.icahdq.org/page/PastFuture | date = 27 May 2003 }} Paper presented at the annual meeting of the [[International Communication Association]], Marriott Hotel, San Diego, CA, May 27, 2003.

==Views on sexual objectification==
{{see also|Gaze}}
While the concept of sexual objectification is important within feminist theory, ideas vary widely on what constitutes sexual objectification and what are the ethical implications of such objectification. Some feminists such as [[Naomi Wolf]] find the concept of [[physical attractiveness]] itself to be problematic,&lt;ref name=beautymyth&gt;{{cite book |last=Wolf |first=Naomi |author-link=Naomi Wolf |title=The beauty myth: how images of beauty are used against women |publisher=Perennial |location=New York |year=2002 |origyear=1992 |isbn=978-0-06-051218-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/beautymyth00naom }}&lt;/ref&gt; with some [[radical feminists]]  being opposed to any evaluation of another person's sexual attractiveness based on physical characteristics.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs references to reliable sources|date=September 2015}} [[John Stoltenberg]] goes so far as to condemn as wrongfully objectifying any sexual fantasy that involves the visualization of a woman.&lt;ref name=stoltenberg&gt;{{cite book |last=Stoltenberg |first=John |author-link=John Stoltenberg | chapter = Sexual objectification and male supremacy |chapter-url=http://www.feministes-radicales.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Stoltenberg-Refusing-to-be-a-Man.pdf |title=Refusing to be a man: essays on sex and justice |publisher=UCL Press |location=London New York | page = 38 |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-84142-041-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical feminists view objectification as playing a central role in reducing women to what they refer to as the "oppressed sex [[Social class|class]]".{{Cite quote|date=September 2015}} While some feminists view mass media in societies that they argue are [[patriarchal]] to be objectifying, they often focus on [[pornography]] as playing an egregious role in habituating men to objectify women.&lt;ref name='MacKinnon "Only Words"'&gt;{{cite book |last=MacKinnon |first=Catharine |author-link=Catharine MacKinnon |title=Only words |url=https://archive.org/details/onlywords00mack |url-access=registration |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-674-63934-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[social conservatives]] have taken up aspects of the [[feminist]] critique of sexual objectification. In their view however, the increase in the sexual objectification of both sexes in Western culture is one of the negative legacies of the [[sexual revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dr. James Dobson |url=http://www.theinterim.com/issues/society-culture/dr-james-dobson-6 |work=The Interim: Canada's life and family newspaper |location=[[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada |publisher=via [[True Media]] |date=12 January 1997 |accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shalit1&gt;{{cite book |last=Shalit |first=Wendy |author-link=Wendy Shalit |title=A return to modesty: discovering the lost virtue |publisher=Touchstone |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-684-86317-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/returntomodestyd00shal }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reisman |first=Judith A. |author-link=Judith Reisman |title="Soft porn" plays hardball: its tragic effects on women, children, and the family |url=https://archive.org/details/softpornplayshar00reis |url-access=registration |publisher=Huntington House Publishers |location=[[Lafayette, Louisiana]] |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-910311-92-2 |pages=32–46, 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Holz |first=Adam R. |title=Is average the new ugly? |url=http://www.pluggedin.com/familyroom/articles/2007/isaveragethenewugly.aspx |work=[[Plugged In|Plugged In Online]] |publisher=[[Focus on the Family]] |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=National Coalition for the Protection of Children &amp; Families |url=http://pureintimacy.org/piArticles/A000000551.cfm |title=Subtle Dangers of Pornography (special report by the National Coalition for the Protection of Children &amp; Families) |work=Pure Intimacy (website) |publisher=[[Focus on the Family]] |date=July 1997 |accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics, notably [[Wendy Shalit]], advocate a return to pre-sexual revolution standards of [[sexual morality]], which Shalit refers to as a "return to [[modesty]]", as an antidote to sexual objectification.&lt;ref name=shalit1/&gt;&lt;ref name=shalit2&gt;{{cite web |last=Shalit |first=Wendy |author-link=Wendy Shalit |title=Modesty revisited |url=http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles/ShalitModesty.php |website=orthodoxytoday.org |publisher=[[Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America|Fr.

Others contest feminist claims about the objectification of women. [[Camille Paglia]] holds that "[t]urning people into sex objects is one of the specialties of our species." In her view, objectification is closely tied to (and may even be identical with) the highest human faculties toward conceptualization and [[aesthetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paglia |first=Camille |author-link=Camille Paglia |title=Sexual personae: art and decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-679-73579-3|title-link=Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Individualist feminist]] [[Wendy McElroy]] says, given that  'objectification' of women means to make women into sexual objects; it is meaningless because, 'sexual objects', taken literally, means nothing because inanimate objects do not have sexuality. She continues that women are their bodies as well as their minds and souls, and so focusing on a single aspect should not be "degrading".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McElroy |first=Wendy |author-link=Wendy McElroy |title=A feminist overview of pornography, ending in a defense thereof |url=http://www.wendymcelroy.com/freeinqu.htm |website=WendyMcElroy.com |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectification theory==
{{expert needed|Feminism|ex2=Gender Studies|section|reason=The prose is jargon-filled, repetitive and nearly impenetrable to laypeople. The structure needs improvement|date=January 2015}}
Objectification theory is a framework for understanding the experiences of women in cultures that sexual objectify them, proposed by [[Barbara Fredrickson]] and Tomi-Ann Roberts in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Fredrickson|first1 = B. L.|authorlink1 = Barbara Fredrickson|last2 = Roberts|first2 = T.-A.|year = 1997|title = Objectification Theory|journal = [[Psychology of Women Quarterly]]|volume = 21|issue = 2|pages = 173–206|doi = 10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00108.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this framework, Fredrickson and Roberts draw conclusions about women's experiences. This theory states that, because of sexual objectification, women learn to internalize an outsider's view of their bodies as the primary view of themselves. Women, they explain, begin to view their bodies as objects separate from their person. This internalization has been termed self-objectification. This theory does not seek to prove the existence of sexual objectification; the theory assumes its existence in culture. This self-objectification then, according to objectification theory, leads to increased habitual body monitoring. With this framework in mind, Fredrickson and Roberts suggest explanations for consequences they believe are the result of sexual objectification. The consequences suggested are: increased feelings of shame, increased feelings of anxiety, decreased peak motivational state, and decreased awareness of internal bodily states.

Sexual objectification has been studied based on the proposition that girls and women develop their primary view of their physical selves from observing others. These observations can take place in the media or through personal experience.&lt;ref name=bartky&gt;{{cite book |last=Bartky |first=Sandra Lee |authorlink=Sandra Bartky |chapter=On Psychological Oppression |title=Femininity and Domination: Studies in the Phenomenology of Oppression |page=22-32 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=New York |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-415-90186-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f842YFos8UwC&amp;pg=PA22 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}} Through a blend of expected and actual exposure, women are socialized to objectify their own physical characteristics from a [[Grammatical person|third-person]] perception, which is identified as self-objectification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaschak |first=Ellyn |authorlink=Ellyn Kaschak |title=Engendered Lives: A New Psychology of Women's Experience |url=https://archive.org/details/engenderedlivesn00kascrich |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/engenderedlivesn00kascrich/page/12 12] |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |location=New York, New York |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-465-01349-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women and girls develop an expected physical appearance for themselves, based on observations of others; and are aware that others are likely to observe as well. The sexual objectification and self-objectification of women is believed to influence social [[gender roles]] and inequalities between the sexes.&lt;ref name=Goldenberg&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goldenberg |first1=Jamie L. |last2=Roberts |first2=Tomi-Ann |chapter=The Beast within the Beauty: An Existential Perspective on the Objectification and Condemnation of Women |editor-last1=Greenberg |editor-first1=Jeff |editorlink1=Jeff Greenberg |editor-last2=Koole |editor-first2=Sander L. |editor-last3=Pyszczynski |editor-first3=Thomas A. |editorlink3=Tom Pyszczynski |title=Handbook of Experimental Existential Psychology |pages=71–85 |publisher=[[Guilford Press]] |location=New York |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-59385-040-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j_KMRe9wK2MC&amp;pg=PA71 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-objectification===

[[Self-objectification]] can increase in situations which heighten the awareness of an individual's physical appearance.&lt;ref name=frederickson1.82&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Fredrickson |first1=Barbara L. |last2=Harrison |first2=Kristen |authorlink1=Barbara Fredrickson |title=Throwing like a Girl: Self-Objectification Predicts Adolescent Girls' Motor Performance |journal=[[Journal of Sport and Social Issues]] |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=79–101 |doi=10.1177/0193723504269878 |year=2005 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}} Here, the presence of a [[third-person (video games)|third-person]] observer is enhanced. Therefore, when individuals know others are looking at them, or will be looking at them, they are more likely to care about their physical appearance. Examples of the enhanced presence of an observer include the presence of an audience, camera, or other known observer.

===Women, girls, and self-objectification===
Primarily, objectification theory describes how women and girls are influenced as a result of expected social and [[gender roles]].&lt;ref name=bartky/&gt; Research indicates not all women are influenced equally, due to the [[anatomical]], [[hormonal]], and [[Genetics|genetic]] differences of the female body; however, women's bodies are often objectified and evaluated more frequently.&lt;ref name=frederickson1.82 /&gt;{{rp|90–95}} Self-objectification in girls tends to stem from two main causes: the internalization of traditional beauty standards as translated through media as well as any instances of sexual objectification that they might encounter in their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McKay |first=Tajare' |title=Female self-objectification: causes, consequences and prevention |journal=[[McNair Scholars Research Journal]] |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=53–70 |year=2013 |issn=2166-109X |url=http://commons.emich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1065&amp;context=mcnair |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not uncommon for women to translate their anxieties over their constant sense of objectification into obsessive self-surveillance. This, in turn, can lead to many serious problems in women and girls, including "body shame, anxiety, negative attitudes toward menstruation, a disrupted flow of consciousness, diminished awareness of internal bodily states, depression, sexual dysfunction, and disordered eating."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Calogero |first1=Rachel M. |last2=Davis |first2=William N. |last3=Thompson |first3=J. Kevin |title=The Role of Self-Objectification in the Experience of Women with Eating Disorders |journal=[[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=43–50 |doi=10.1007/s11199-005-1192-9 |year=2005 |url=http://brown.uk.com/eatingdisorders/calogero.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.413.8397 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual objectification occurs when a person is identified by their sexual body parts or sexual function. In essence, an individual loses their identity, and is recognized solely by the physical characteristics of their body.&lt;ref name=bartky/&gt; The purpose of this recognition is to bring enjoyment to others, or to serve as a sexual object for society.&lt;ref name=LeMoncheck /&gt; Sexual objectification can occur as a [[social construct]] among individuals.

===Psychological consequences===
Objectification theory suggests both direct and indirect consequences of objectification to women. Indirect consequences include [[self consciousness]] in terms that a woman is consistently checking or rearranging her clothes or appearance to ensure that she is presentable. More direct consequences are related to sexual victimization. Rape and sexual harassment are examples of this.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2 /&gt; Doob (2012) states that sexual harassment is one of the challenges faced by women in workplace. This may constitute sexual jokes or comments, most of which are degrading.&lt;ref name="Doob"&gt;{{cite book |last=Doob |first=Christopher B. |title=Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society |publisher=[[Pearson Education, Inc.]] |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-205-79241-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research indicates that objectification theory is valuable to understanding how repeated visual images in the media are socialized and translated into [[mental health]] problems, including psychological consequences on the individual and societal level.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2 /&gt; These include increased self-consciousness, increased body anxiety, heightened mental health threats ([[Clinical depression|depression]], [[anorexia nervosa]], [[bulimia]], and [[sexual dysfunction]]), and increased body shame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Moradi |first1=Bonnie |last2=Huang |first2=Yu-Ping |title=Objectification Theory and Psychology of Women: A Decade of Advances and Future Directions |journal=[[Psychology of Women Quarterly]] |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=377–398 |doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2008.00452.x |year=2008 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the theory has been used to explore an array of dependent variables including [[disordered eating]], [[mental health]], [[Clinical depression|depression]], motor performance, [[body image]], idealized body type, [[stereotype]] formation, sexual perception and sexual typing.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2/&gt;&lt;ref name=frederickson1.82/&gt; Body shame is a byproduct of the concept of an idealized body type adopted by most Western cultures that depicts a thin, model-type figure. Thus, women will engage in actions meant to change their body such as dieting, exercise, eating disorders, [[cosmetic surgery]], etc.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2 /&gt; Effects of objectification theory are identified on both the individual and societal levels.

===Causes of depression===
[[Learned helplessness]] theory posits that because human bodies are only alterable to a certain point, people develop a sense of body shame and anxiety from which they create a feeling of helplessness in relation to correcting their physical appearance and helplessness in being able to control the way in which others perceive their appearance. This lack of control often results in depression.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2 /&gt; In relating to a lack of motivation, objectification theory states that women have less control in relationships and the work environment because they have to depend on the evaluation of another who is typically basing their evaluation on physical appearance. Since the dependence on another's evaluation limits a woman's ability to create her own positive experiences and motivation, it adversely increases her likelihood for depression.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2 /&gt; Furthermore, sexual victimization may be a cause. Specifically, victimization within the workplace degrades women. Harassment experienced every day wears on a woman, and sometimes this results in a state of depression.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Doob"/&gt;
