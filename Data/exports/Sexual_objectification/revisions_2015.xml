'''Sexual objectification''' is the act of treating a person as an instrument of [[sexual pleasure]]. [[Objectification]] more broadly means treating a person as a [[commodity]] or an object without regard to their personality or [[dignity]]. Objectification is most commonly examined at the level of a society, but can also refer to the behavior of individuals.

The concept of sexual objectification and, in particular, the objectification of women, is an important idea in feminist theory and psychological theories derived from feminism. Many feminists regard sexual objectification as deplorable and as playing an important role in gender inequality. However, some social commentators argue that some modern women objectify themselves as an expression of their empowerment.

==Sexual objectification of women==
Female sexual objectification by a male involves a woman being viewed primarily as an object of male sexual desire, rather than as a whole person.&lt;ref name=Barry&gt;{{citation | last = Barry | first = Kathleen | contribution = Pornography: the ideoloy of cultural sadism | editor-last = Barry | editor-first = Kathleen | title = Female sexual slavery | page = 247 | publisher = NYU Press | location = New York London | year = 1984 | isbn = 9780814710692 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LeMoncheck&gt;{{citation | last = LeMoncheck | first = Linda | contribution = I only do it for the money: pornography, prostitution, and the business of sex | editor-last = LeMoncheck | editor-first = Linda | title = Loose women, lecherous men a feminist philosophy of sex | page = 133 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York, New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780195105568 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Szymanski | first1 = Dawn M. | last2 = Moffitt | first2 = Lauren B. | last3 = Carr | first3 = Erika R. | title = Sexual objectification of women: advances to theory and research | journal = [[The Counseling Psychologist]] | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 6–38 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0011000010378402 | date = January 2011 | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0011000010378402 | ref = harv| postscript = .}} [http://www.apa.org/education/ce/sexual-objectification.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Although opinions differ as to which situations are objectionable, some feminists&lt;ref name=Jhally&gt;{{cite AV media | last = Jhally | first = Sut (director) | author-link = Sut Jhally | date = 1997 | title = Dreamworlds II: desire, sex, power in music | medium= Documentary | location= USA | publisher= [[Media Education Foundation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; see objectification of women taking place in the sexually oriented depictions of women in advertising and media, women being portrayed as weak or submissive through [[pornography]], images in more mainstream [[Published media|media]] such as [[advertising]] and [[art]], [[Striptease|stripping]] and [[prostitution]], men brazenly evaluating or judging women sexually or aesthetically in public spaces and events, such as beauty contests, and the presumed need for [[cosmetic surgery]], particularly breast enlargement and [[labiaplasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Yeung | first = Peter | title=  The female artists reclaiming their bodies | url = http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/22316/1/the-female-artists-reclaiming-their-bodies | work = Dazed | publisher = Dazed Digital | date = December 2014 | quote = It is through this prism of patriarchal control that much exploitation of women has been enacted: commonly phallocentric portraiture has been used to permeate the rest of society...The fetishisation of womens’ bodies and their regular reduction to breasts is something that New York artist Cindy Hinant is acutely aware of.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pro-feminist cultural critics such as [[Robert Jensen]] and [[Sut Jhally]] accuse [[mass media]] and advertising of promoting the objectification of women to help promote goods and services.&lt;ref name=Jhally /&gt;&lt;ref name= Jensen&gt;{{citation | last = Jensen | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Jensen | contribution = Using pornography | editor-last1 = Dines | editor-first1 = Gail | editor-last2 = Jensen | editor-first2 = Robert | editor-last3 = Russo | editor-first3 = Ann | editor-link1 = Gail Dines | editor-link2 = Robert Jensen | title = Pornography: the production and consumption of inequality | page = 133 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York, New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780195105568 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frith&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Frith | first1 = Katherine | last2 = Shaw | first2 = Ping | last3 = Cheng | first3 = Hong | title = The construction of beauty: a cross-cultural analysis of women's magazine advertising | journal = [[Journal of Communication]] | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 56–70 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1460-2466.2005.tb02658.x | date = March 2005 | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2005.tb02658.x | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objection to the objectification of women is not a recent phenomenon. In the French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], for example, there was a debate as to whether a woman's breasts were merely a sensual enticement or rather a natural gift. In [[Alexandre Guillaume Mouslier de Moissy]]'s 1771 play ''The True Mother'' (''La Vraie Mère''), the title character rebukes her husband for treating her as merely an object for his sexual gratification: "Are your senses so gross as to look on these breasts &amp;ndash; the respectable treasures of nature &amp;ndash; as merely an embellishment, destined to ornament the chest of women?"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Schama | first = Simon | author-link = Simon Schama | contribution = The cultural construction of a citizen: II Casting roles: children of nature | editor-last = Schama | editor-first = Simon | editor-link = Simon Schama | title = [[Citizens.

===Female self-objectification===
[[Ariel Levy]] contends that Western women who exploit their sexuality by, for example, wearing revealing clothing and engaging in lewd behavior, engage in female self-objectification, meaning they objectify themselves. While some women see such behaviour as a form of [[empowerment]], Levy contends that it has led to greater emphasis on a physical criterion or [[sexualization]] for women's perceived self-worth, which Levy calls "raunch culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Levy | first = Ariel | author-link = Ariel Levy | title = [[Female Chauvinist Pigs|Female chauvinist pigs: women and the rise of raunch culture]] | publisher = Pocket Books | location = London | year = 2006 }} ISBN 9781416526384&lt;/ref&gt;

Levy discusses this phenomenon in ''[[Female Chauvinist Pigs|Female Chauvinist Pigs: Women and the Rise of Raunch Culture]]''. Levy followed the camera crew from the ''[[Girls Gone Wild (franchise)|Girls Gone Wild]]'' video series, and argues that contemporary America's sexualized culture not only objectifies women, it encourages women to objectify themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/article2523264.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Yes we are bovvered | first=Ginny | last=Dougary | date= 25 September 2007 | accessdate= 23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In today's culture, Levy writes, the idea of a woman participating in a wet T-shirt contest or being comfortable watching explicit [[pornography]] has become a symbol of feminist strength; she says that she was surprised at how many people, both men and women, working for programs such as ''Girls Gone Wild'' told her that this new "raunchy" culture marked not the ''downfall'' of feminism but its ''triumph'', because it proved that U.S. women have become strong enough to express their sexuality publicly.

== Views on sexual objectification ==
{{related|[[Gaze]]}}
While the concept of sexual objectification is important within feminist theory, ideas vary widely on what constitutes sexual objectification and what are the ethical implications of such objectification. Some feminists such as [[Naomi Wolf]] find the concept of [[physical attractiveness]] itself to be problematic,&lt;ref name=beautymyth&gt;{{cite book | last = Wolf | first = Naomi | author-link = Naomi Wolf | title = The beauty myth: how images of beauty are used against women | publisher = Perennial | location = New York | year = 2002 | origyear = 1992 | isbn = 9780060512187 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with some [[radical feminists]]{{Who|date=September 2015}} being opposed to any evaluation of another person's sexual attractiveness based on physical characteristics.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs references to reliable sources|date=September 2015}} [[John Stoltenberg]] goes so far as to condemn as wrongfully objectifying any sexual fantasy that involves visualization of a woman.&lt;ref name=stoltenberg&gt;{{cite book | last = Stoltenberg | first = John | author-link = John Stoltenberg | title = Refusing to be a man: essays on sex and justice | publisher = UCL Press | location = London New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9781841420417 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical feminists view objectification as playing a central role in reducing women to what they refer to as the "oppressed sex [[Social class|class]]".{{Cite quote|date=September 2015}} While some feminists view mass media in societies that they argue are [[patriarchal]] to be objectifying, they often focus on [[pornography]] as playing an egregious role in habituating men to objectify women.&lt;ref name='MacKinnon "Only Words"'&gt;{{cite book|last=MacKinnon|first=Catharine | author-link = Catharine MacKinnon | title = Only words | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1993 | isbn = 9780674639348 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other feminists, particularly those identified with [[sex-positive feminism]], take a different view of sexual objectification and see it as a problem when it is not counterbalanced by women's sense of their own sexual subjectivity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Some [[social conservatives]] have taken up aspects of the [[feminist]] critique of sexual objectification. In their view however, the increase in the sexual objectification of both sexes in Western culture is one of the negative legacies of the [[sexual revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Dr. James Dobson | url = http://www.theinterim.com/issues/society-culture/dr-james-dobson-6 | work = The Interim: Canada's life and family newspaper | location = [[Toronto|Toronto, Canada]] | publisher = via [[True Media]] | date = 12 January 1997 | accessdate = 1 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shalit1&gt;{{cite book | last = Shalit | first = Wendy | author-link = Wendy Shalit | title = A return to modesty: discovering the lost virtue | publisher = Touchstone | location = New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780684863177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Reisman | first = Judith A. | author-link = Judith Reisman | title = "Soft porn" plays hardball: its tragic effects on women, children, and the family | publisher = Huntington House Publishers | location = [[Lafayette, Louisiana]] | year = 1991 | isbn = 9780910311922 }} (pp. 32-46, p. 173)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Holz | first = Adam R. | title = Is average the new ugly? | url = http://www.pluggedin.com/familyroom/articles/2007/isaveragethenewugly.aspx | work = [[Plugged In|Plugged In Online]] | publisher = [[Focus on the Family]] | date = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=National Coalition for the Protection of Children &amp; Families |url=http://pureintimacy.org/piArticles/A000000551.cfm |title=Subtle dangers of pornogaphy (special report by the National Coalition for the Protection of Children &amp; Families) |work =Pure Intimacy (website) | publisher = [[Focus on the Family]] | date = July 1997 |accessdate= 1 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics, notably [[Wendy Shalit]], advocate a return to pre-sexual revolution standards of [[sexual morality]], which Shalit refers to as a "return to [[modesty]]", as an antidote to sexual objectification.&lt;ref name=shalit1/&gt;&lt;ref name=shalit2&gt;{{cite web | last = Shalit | first = Wendy | author-link = Wendy Shalit | title = Modesty revisited | url = http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles/ShalitModesty.php | website = orthodoxytoday.org | publisher = [[Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America|Fr. Johannes Jacobse]] | date =2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others contest feminist claims about the objectification of women. [[Camille Paglia]] holds that "Turning people into sex objects is one of the specialties of our species." In her view, objectification is closely tied to (and may even be identical with) the highest human faculties toward conceptualization and [[aesthetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Paglia | first = Camille | author-link = Camille Paglia | title = [[Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson|Sexual personae: art and decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson]] | publisher = Vintage Books | location = New York | year = 1991 }} ISBN 9780679735793&lt;/ref&gt; [[Individualist feminist]] [[Wendy McElroy]] says, given that  'objectification' of women means to make women into sexual objects; it is meaningless because, 'sexual objects', taken literally, means nothing because inanimate objects do not have sexuality. She continues that women are their bodies as well as their minds and souls, and so focusing on a single aspect should not be "degrading".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = McElroy | first = Wendy | author-link = Wendy McElroy | title = A feminist overview of pornography, ending in a defense thereof | url = http://www.wendymcelroy.com/freeinqu.htm | website = WendyMcElroy.com | date = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectification theory ==
{{expert-subject|Feminism|ex2=Gender Studies|section|reason=The prose is jargon-filled, repetitive and nearly impenetrable to laypeople. The structure needs improvement|date=January 2015}}
Sexual objectification has been studied based on the proposition that girls and women develop their primary view of their physical selves from observing others. These observations can take place in the media or through personal experience.&lt;ref name=bartky&gt;{{citation | last = Bartky | first = Sandra Lee | author-link = Sandra Bartky | contribution = On psychological oppression | editor-last = Bartky | editor-first = Sandra Lee | editor-link = Sandra Bartky | title = Femininity and domination: studies in the phenomenology of oppression | page = 26 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780415901864 | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through a blend of expected and actual exposure, women are socialized to objectify their own physical characteristics from a [[Grammatical person|third person]] perception, which is identified as self-objectification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kaschak | first = Ellyn | author-link = Ellyn Kaschak | title = Engendered lives: a new psychology of women's experience | page = 12 | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York, New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780465013494 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women and girls develop an expected physical appearance for themselves, based on observations of others; and are aware that others are likely to observe as well. The sexual objectification and self-objectification of women is believed to influence social [[gender roles]] and inequalities between the sexes.&lt;ref name=Goldenberg&gt;{{citation | last1 = Goldenberg | first1 = Jamie L. | last2 = Roberts | first2 = Tomi-Ann | contribution = The beast within the beauty: an existential perspective on the objectification and condemnation of women | editor-last1 = Greenberg | editor-first1 = Jeff | editor-last2 = Koole | editor-first2 = Sander L. | editor-last3 = Pyszczynski | editor-first3 = Tom | title = Handbook of experimental existential psychology | pages = 71–85 | publisher = Guilford Press | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781593850401 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-objectification ===
Self-objectification can increase in situations which heighten the awareness of an individual’s physical appearance.&lt;ref name=frederickson1.82&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fredrickson | first1 = Barbara L. | last2 = Harrison | first2 = Kristen | author-link1 = Barbara Fredrickson | title = Throwing like a girl: self-objectification predicts adolescent girls’ motor performance | journal = [[Journal of Sport and Social Issues]] | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 79–101 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0193723504269878 | date = February 2005 | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0193723504269878 | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}} Here, the presence of a [[third person (video games)|third person]] observer is enhanced. Therefore, when individuals know others are looking at them, or will be looking at them, they are more likely to care about their physical appearance. Examples of the enhanced presence of an observer include the presence of an audience, camera, or other known observer.

=== Women, girls, and self-objectification ===
Primarily, objectification theory describes how women and girls are influenced as a result of expected social and [[gender roles]].&lt;ref name=bartky/&gt; Research indicates not all women are influenced equally, due to the [[anatomical]], [[hormonal]], and [[Genetics|genetic]] differences of the female body; however, women’s bodies are often objectified and evaluated more frequently.&lt;ref name=frederickson1.82 /&gt;{{rp|90–95}} Self-objectification in girls tends to stem from two main causes: the internalization of traditional beauty standards as translated through media as well as any instances of sexual objectification that they might encounter in their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = McKay | first = Tajare' | title = Female self-objectification: causes, consequences and prevention | journal = McNair Scholars Research Journal | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 53–70 | publisher = [[Ronald E.

This, in turn, can lead to many serious problems in women and girls, including "body shame, anxiety, negative attitudes toward menstruation, a disrupted flow of consciousness, diminished awareness of internal bodily states, depression, sexual dysfunction, and disordered eating."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Calogero | first1 = Rachel M. | last2 = Davis | first2 = William N. | last3 = Thompson | first3 = J.

Sexual objectification occurs when a person is identified by their sexual body parts or sexual function. In essence, an individual loses their identity, and is recognized solely by the physical characteristics of their body.&lt;ref name=bartky/&gt; The purpose of this recognition is to bring enjoyment to others, or to serve as a sexual object for society.&lt;ref name=LeMoncheck /&gt; Sexual objectification can occur as a social construct among individuals.

=== Psychological consequences ===
Objectification theory suggests both direct and indirect consequences of objectification to women. Indirect consequences include [[self consciousness]] in terms that a woman is consistently checking or rearranging her clothes or appearance to ensure that she is presentable. More direct consequences are related to sexual victimization. Rape and sexual harassment are examples of this.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2 /&gt; Doob (2012) states that sexual harassment is one of the challenges faced by women in workplace. This may constitute sexual jokes or comments, most of which are degrading.&lt;ref name="Doob"&gt;{{cite book | last = Doob | first = Christopher B. | title = Social inequality and social stratification in US society | publisher = Pearson Education, Inc. | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | year = 2013 | isbn = 9780205792412 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research indicates that objectification theory is valuable to understanding how repeated visual images in the media are socialized and translated into [[mental health]] problems, including psychological consequences on the individual and societal level.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2 /&gt; These include increased self-consciousness, increased body anxiety, heightened mental health threats ([[Clinical depression|depression]], [[anorexia nervosa]], [[bulimia]], and [[sexual dysfunction]]), and increased body shame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Moradi | first1 = Bonnie | last2 = Huang | first2 = Yu-Ping | title = Objectification theory and psychology of women: a decade of advances and future directions | journal = [[Psychology of Women Quarterly]] | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 377–398 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-6402.2008.00452.x | date = December 2008 | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-6402.2008.00452.x | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the theory has been used to explore an array of dependent variables including [[disordered eating]], [[mental health]], [[Clinical depression|depression]], motor performance, [[body image]], idealized body type, [[stereotype]] formation, sexual perception and sexual typing.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2/&gt;&lt;ref name=frederickson1.82/&gt; Body shame is a byproduct of the concept of an idealized body type adopted by most Western cultures that depicts a thin, model-type figure. Thus, women will engage in actions meant to change their body such as dieting, exercise, eating disorders, [[cosmetic surgery]], etc.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2 /&gt; Effects of objectification theory are identified on both the individual and societal levels.

===Causes of depression===
[[Learned helplessness]] theory posits that because human bodies are only alterable to a certain point, people develop a sense of body shame and anxiety from which they create a feeling of helplessness in relation to correcting their physical appearance and helplessness in being able to control the way in which others perceive their appearance. This lack of control often results in depression.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2 /&gt; In relating to a lack of motivation, objectification theory states that women have less control in relationships and the work environment because they have to depend on the evaluation of another who is typically basing their evaluation on physical appearance. Since the dependence on another's evaluation limits a woman's ability to create her own positive experiences and motivation, it adversely increases her likelihood for depression.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2 /&gt; Furthermore, sexual victimization may be a cause. Specifically, victimization within the workplace degrades women. Harassment experienced every day wears on a woman, and sometimes results in a state of depression.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Doob"/&gt;

== Sexual fetishism ==
[[Sexual fetishism]] can be considered sexual objectification when a person is assigned or adopts the status of the fetish object. In [[BDSM]] activities, even though it is consensual, subjecting a submissive to [[erotic humiliation]] can be regarded as sexual objectification.{{Citation needed|reason=Very conflicting statement.|date=June 2014}} [[Human furniture]] is a form of fetishism and sexual objectification. [[Allen Jones (sculptor)|Allen Jones]]' [[Hatstand, Table and Chair|''Hatstand'', ''Table'' and ''Chair'']] sculptures incorporates semi-naked women into furniture, in a show of exaggerated sexual objectification.
