[[Mass media]], [[advertisement]] and lately [[reality TV]] are often accused of relying heavily on such basis in order to produce their different materials.

== Objectification ==

Many [[actors]] and famous people are considered [[sex object]]s or "[[sex symbol]]s" (such as [[Pamela Anderson]], [[Tom Cruise]], [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Jessica Simpson]]). This new reality does not follow either the traditional [[conservative gender roles]] or the [[feminist movement]].
[[Marilyn Monroe]] might be considered a fore-runner in portraying this [[archetype]].
Some feminists have long argued that traditional attitudes to women in many societies constitute non-consensual sexual objectification of women. [[Masculist]]s and other critics of [[feminism]] often contest these claims. In the years since the feminist movement, sexual objectification of men has greatly increased. Some critics of feminism regard the equality of sexual objectification as being amongst the most prominent legacies of feminism.

== Fetishism ==
 
In some circumstances, sexual objectification is also the [[Fetishism|fetishistic]] act of regarding a person as an object for erotic purposes. [[Allen Jones (sculptor)|Allen Jones]]' sculptures Hat Stand and Table Sculpture, made in [[1969]], which show semi-naked women in the roles of furniture, are clear examples of the depiction of the [[fantasy]] of sexual objectification. (This particular interest, a form of [[Bondage (BDSM)|sexual bondage]] that involves making furniture designed to incorporate a bound person, is also known as "[[forniphilia]]".)
A desire to be objectified occurs in many men and women's sexual fantasies. Objectification for fetishistic purposes may for example provide [[erotic humiliation]] for the person so regarded, whether male or female. As with most sexual activities, it is generally viewed as abusive if it is not part of a consensual arrangement, such as in [[BDSM]] play.
