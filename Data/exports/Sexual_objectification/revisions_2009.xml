'''Sexual objectification''' is [[objectification]] of a person. It occurs when a person is seen as a sexual object when their sexual attributes and [[physical attractiveness]] are separated from the rest of their personality and existence as an individual{{Clarify me|date=April 2009}}, and reduced to instruments of pleasure for another person.&lt;ref name=Bartky/&gt;&lt;ref name=LeMoncheck&gt;LeMoncheck, Linda, ''Loose Women, Lecherous Men: A Feminist Philosophy of Sex'' (Oxford University press, 1997), ISBN 9780195105559, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of sexual objectification and, in particular, the objectification of [[women]], is an important idea in [[feminist]] theory and psychological theories derived from feminism.&lt;ref name=Barry&gt;Barry, Kathleen, ''Female Sexual Slavery'' (NYU Press, 1994), ISBN 9780814710697, p.247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldenberg&gt; Goldenberg, Jamie L., and Tomi-Ann Roberts, 'The Beast within the Beauty: An Existential Perspective on the Objectification and Condemnation of Women' in Jeff Greenberg, Sander Leon Koole, Thomas A.

== Sexual objectification of women  ==
Feminist scholars say that the [[objectification]] of women involves disregarding personal and intellectual abilities and capabilities, and women's reduction to instruments of sexual pleasure for men.&lt;ref name=LeMoncheck/&gt;&lt;ref name=Barry/&gt;  Examples of phenomena seen by some feminists as objectifying women include depictions of women in advertising and media, images of women in [[pornography]], as well as images in more mainstream [[Published media|media]] such as [[advertising]] and [[art]], [[stripping]] and [[prostitution]], men evaluating women sexually in public spaces, and [[cosmetic surgery]], particularly [[breast enlargement]].{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

Historically, feminists believe women have often been valued for their physical attributes. Some feminists and psychologists argue that such sexual objectification can lead to negative psychological effects including [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[hope]]lessness, and can give women negative [[self-image]]s because of the belief that their intelligence and competence are not being acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Such claims include: girls' understanding of the importance of appearance in society may contribute to feelings of [[fear]], [[shame]], and [[disgust]] that some experience during the transition from girlhood to womanhood because they sense that they are becoming more visible to society as sexual objects;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Janet. 1994.

Pro-feminist cultural critics such as [[Robert Jensen]] and [[Sut Jhally]] accuse [[mass media]] and advertising of promoting the objectification of women to help promote goods and services.&lt;ref name= Jensen&gt; Jensen, Robert, 'Using Pornography' in Dines, Gail, Robert Jensen and Ann Russo (eds) ''Pornography: The Production and Consumption of Inequality'' (Routledge, 1998), ISBN 9780415918138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jhally&gt; Jhally, Sut (dir) ''Dreamworlds II: Desire, Sex, Power in Music'' (Media Education Foundation, USA, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frith&gt; Frith, Katherine, Ping Shaw and Hong Cheng 'The Construction of Beauty: A Cross-Cultural Analysis of Women's Magazine Advertising' in ''Journal of Communication'' 55 (1), 2005, pp.56–70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual self-objectification===
Feminists such as [[Ariel Levy]] contend that Western women have begun to sexually objectify themselves by choice, by wearing increasingly revealing clothing and engaging in lewd behavior. While these women see their own objectification as a form of [[empowerment]], critics of this behavior contend that it has led to greater emphasis on a physical criterion for women's perceived self worth.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/2008/06/30/2008-06-30_save_the_males_ho_culture_lights_fuses_b.html 'Save the males': Ho culture lights fuses, but confuses], By KATHLEEN PARKER, NY Daily News, June 30th 2008. Based on "Save the Males" by Kathleen Parker, Copyright  2008, Random House, an imprint of Random House Publishing Group. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Levy discusses this phenomenon in her 2005 book ''[[Female Chauvinist Pigs|Female Chauvinist Pigs: Women and the Rise of Raunch Culture]]''. Levy followed the camera crew from the ''[[Girls Gone Wild]]'' video series, and argues that contemporary America's sexualized culture not only objectifies women, it encourages women to objectify themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/article2523264.ece Yes, we are bovvered - Times Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In today's culture, Levy writes, the idea of a woman participating in a wet T-shirt contest or being comfortable watching explicit [[pornography]] has become a symbol of feminist strength; she says that she was surprised at how many people, both men and women, working for programs such as ''Girls Gone Wild'' told her that this new "raunchy" culture marked not the ''downfall'' of feminism but its ''triumph'', because it proved that U.S. women have become strong enough to express their sexuality publicly.

== Sexual objectification of men ==

[[Feminist]] authors [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] and [[Naomi Wolf]] write that women's sexual liberation has led many women to view men as sex objects.&lt;ref&gt;Sommers, Christina Hoff. 1994. ''Who Stole Feminism: How Women Have Betrayed Women''. New York. Simon and Schuster (pp.264-265), ISBN 0-671-7924-8 (hc), ISBN 0-684-80156-6 (pb)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Naomi. 1994. ''Fire With Fire: The New Female Power and How to Use It''. New York: Fawcett Columbine (pp.225-228), ISBN 0-449-90951-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friend,Tad. ''Yes (feminist women who like sex)'' Esquire. February 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Research has suggested that the psychological effects of objectification on men are similar to those of women, leading to negative [[body image]] among men.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}

Instances where men are being presented as sex objects include [[movies]] and [[television shows]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShirtlessScene Shirtless Scene]&lt;/ref&gt; [[beefcake calendars]],  women's magazines, male [[striptease|strip shows]], and [[clothed female nude male]] (CFNM) events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sensations4women.com/sportsIni/index.html Sports, Gym Classes, Team Initiations and Events]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, more women are purchasing and consuming [[pornography]] (especially, adult videos).&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, Wendy. 1995. ''XXX: A Woman's Right to Pornography''. New York: St. Martin's Press (p.36)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/article2355510.ece 66% of women watch porn]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also gay pornograpic magazines such as ''[[Blueboy]]'', ''Honcho'' and ''Manscape'' and [[beefcake magazines|physique magazines]] including ''Men's Workout'', ''Men's Workout'' and ''Men's Exercise'' which appeal to the gay male [[demographic]]. [[Gay pornography|Gay male pornography]] makes up 1/3 of the [[adult film]] [[industry]]. Some male strip clubs cater to a gay male clientele.

== Views on sexual objectification ==
{{related|[[Gaze#Gaze_and_feminist_theory|The gaze]]}}
While the concept of sexual objectification is important within feminist and masculist theory, ideas vary widely on what constitutes sexual objectification and what are the ethical implications of such objectification. Some feminists such as [[Naomi Wolf]] find the concept of physical [[attractiveness]] itself to be problematic,&lt;ref name=beautymyth&gt;Wolf, Naomi. (1992). ''The Beauty Myth: How Images of Beauty Are Used Against Women''. New York: William Morrow and Co. (Reprinted, 2002. New York: Harper Perennial) ISBN 0060512180&lt;/ref&gt; with some [[radical feminists]] being opposed to any evaluation of another person's sexual attractiveness based on physical characteristics. [[John Stoltenberg]] goes so far as to condemn as wrongfully objectifying any sexual fantasy that involves visualization of a woman.&lt;ref name=stoltenberg&gt; Stoltenberg, John. 1989. Refusing to be a man: Essays on sex and justice. Portland, OR: Breitenbush Books. (Reprinted, 2000. Oxford: Routledge) ISBN 1841420417&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical feminists view objectification as playing a central role in reducing women to what they refer to as the "sex [[Social class|class]]". While some feminists view mass media in societies that they argue are [[patriarchal]] to be objectifying, they often focus on [[pornography]] as playing an egregious role in habituating men to objectify women.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}  Other feminists, particularly those identified with [[sex-positive feminism]], take a different view of sexual objectification and see it as a problem when it is not counterbalanced by women's sense of their own sexual subjectivity.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

Some [[social conservatives]] have taken up aspects of the [[feminist]] critique of sexual objectification. In their view however, the increase in the sexual objectification of both genders in Western culture is one of the negative legacies of the [[sexual revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;National Coalition for the Protection of Children and Families. 1997. [http://www.pureintimacy.org/gr/intimacy/understanding/a0000121.cfm Subtle dangers of pornography]. ''NCPCF in Action Special Report'', July 1997. (Archived at ''Pure Intimacy'' (website).)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shalit1&gt;Shalit, Wendy. 1999. ''A Return To Modesty: Discovering the Lost Virtue''. New York: Free Press. ISBN 0684843161 (hc), ISBN 0684863170 (pb).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riesman, Judith A. 1991. ''Soft Porn Plays Hardball: Its Tragic Effects on Women, Children and the Family.'' Lafayette, LA.  Huntington House Publishers. ( pp.32-46, p.173) ISBN 0-910311-92-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holz, Adam R. 2007.   [http://www.pluggedin.com/en/FamilyRoom/articles/2007/IsAveragetheNewUgly.aspx Is Average the New Ugly?] ''[[Plugged In Online]]''&lt;/ref&gt;These critics, notably [[Wendy Shalit]], advocate a return to pre-sexual revolution standards of [[sexual morality]], which Shalit refers to as a "return to [[modesty]]", as an antidote to sexual objectification.&lt;ref name=shalit1/&gt;&lt;ref name=shalit2&gt;Shalit, Wendy. 2000.

Other feminists contest feminist claims about the objectification of women. [[Camille Paglia]] holds that "Turning people into sex objects is one of the specialties of our species." In her view, objectification is closely tied to (and may even be identical with) the highest human faculties toward conceptualization and [[aesthetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Individualist feminist]] [[Wendy McElroy]] holds that the label "sex object" means nothing because inanimate objects are not sexual. She continues that women are their bodies as well as their minds and souls.&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, Wendy. 2006. [http://www.wendymcelroy.com/freeinqu.htm A feminist overview of pornography, ending in a defense thereof.] ''WendyMcElroy.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectification and sexual fetishism ==

Sexual objectification may also be considered a means of realizing a [[sexual fetish]]; in which a person is assigned, or adopts the status of a fetish object. This may provide [[erotic humiliation]] for the person so regarded. As with most [[BDSM]]-related activities, it is not considered abusive when engaged in consensually. [[Allen Jones (sculptor)|Allen Jones]]' "Hat Stand and Table Sculpture", which show semi-naked women in the roles of furniture, are clear examples of the depiction of the fantasy of sexual objectification.
