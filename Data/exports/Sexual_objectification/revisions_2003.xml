This may provide [[erotic humiliation]] for the person so regarded.

As with most sexual activities, it is generally viewed as abusive if it is not part of a consensual arrangement, such as in [[BDSM]] play.

[[Feminist]]s have long complained that traditional attitudes to women in many societies constitute non-consensual sexual objectification of women.
