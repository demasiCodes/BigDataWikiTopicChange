'''White flight''' is a term for the [[demographics|demographic]] trend where [[working class|working-]] and [[middle-class]] [[white people]] move away from increasingly racial-minority inner-city neighborhoods to white [[suburbs]] and [[Commuter town|exurbs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=58&amp;aid=111344 The Best Story of Our Lives]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=3461488 ABC News: Increasing Diversity]''&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon was first named in the [[United States]], but has occurred in other countries as well.  Some scholars have noted the impact of [[redlining]], [[mortgage discrimination]], and racially restrictive covenants on white flight:  these factors denied or increased the cost of services, such as banking and insurance, to residents in minority [[inner-city]] neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i8043.html White Flight: Atlanta and the Making of Modern Conservatism]'' by Kevin M. Kruse. ISBN 9780691133867&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=TWo8OFJpFtAC How East New York Became a Ghetto]'' by Walter Thabit. ISBN 0814782671. Page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Some social scientists suggest that the historical processes of [[suburbanization]] and decentralization are instances of [[White privilege (sociology)|white privilege]] that have contributed to contemporary patterns of [[environmental racism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Rethinking Environmental Racism: White Privilege and Urban Development in Southern California'' Laura Pulido
Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Vol. 90, No. 1 (Mar., 2000), pp. 12-40&lt;/ref&gt; In some of the largest cities in the [[United States]], the trend started to reverse itself in the 1990s through a process sometimes called  [[gentrification]]. 

==White flight in the United States==
White flight has taken place in nearly every major [[List of American cities|American city]],&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/20/AR2006082000629.html Growing diversity of American cities]'' By Anushka Asthana, Washington Post. Monday, August 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; especially since the end of [[World-War II]] and the ensuing economic and [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]]s.  A variety of factors during this period allowed for the explosive growth of suburbs and demographic change in cities, including the creation of high-speed highways and suburban parkways, which greatly reduced the travel time between suburbs and downtowns and bypassed some city neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="crabgrass"&gt;''Crabgrass Frontier: The Suburbanization of the United States'' by Kenneth T. Jackson. ISBN 0195036107&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of the phenomenon have been significant, particularly in the cities of [[Atlanta]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[Washington DC]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Cleveland]], [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] and [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], all of which lost more than half of their white populations; but it has affected every [[United States metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] in the United States.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}&lt;!--needs reference for "loss of half their white populations" for all cities on the list--&gt; The residential and social segregation of whites from blacks in the United States creates a socialization process that limits whites' chances for developing meaningful relationships with blacks and other minorities. The segregation experienced by whites from blacks fosters segregated lifestyles and leads them to develop positive views about themselves and negative views about blacks.&lt;ref&gt;''"Every Place Has a Ghetto...": The Significance of Whites' Social and Residential Segregation''  Eduardo Bonilla-Silva and  David G. Embrick ''Symbolic Interaction'' Summer 2007, Vol. 30, No. 3, Pages 323-345 &lt;/ref&gt; 

Today, many whites are willing, and are able, to pay a premium to live in a predominantly white neighborhood. Equivalent housing in white areas commands a higher rent.&lt;ref&gt;Kiel, K. A. and J. E. Zabel. "Housing Price Differentials in U.S. Cities: Household and Neighborhood Racial Effects." Journal of Housing Economics 5, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  By bidding up the price of housing, many white neighborhoods again effectively shut out blacks, because blacks are unwilling, or unable, to pay the premium to buy entry into white neighborhoods. Through the 1990s, residential segregation remained at its extreme and has been called "hypersegregation" by some sociologists or "American Apartheid"&lt;ref&gt;Massey, D. S. and N. A. Denton. American Apartheid. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1993. &lt;/ref&gt;
 
===History===
In the years after World War II, many [[white American]]s began to move away from inner cities to newer [[suburb]]an communities. Major cities had experienced tight housing markets during the war years along with an influx of blacks seeking war work. Racism, economic and social pressure as well as the popularity of the automobile all contributed to white flight. Whites also left the city because they thought that suburban communities, with their new housing stock and open spaces, were more desirable places to live, and due to economic conditions or racial discrimination, blacks were frequently unable to follow.&lt;ref name="crabgrass"&gt;..&lt;ref&gt; 

Discriminatory practices, especially those intended to "preserve" white neighborhoods, restricted the ability of non-whites to move from inner-cities to suburbs, even when they were economically able to afford it.  In contrast to this, the same period in history marked a massive suburban expansion available primarily to whites of both wealthy and working class backgrounds, facilitated through highway construction and the availability of federally subsidized home mortgages (VA, FHA, HOLC) which made it easier for families to buy new homes in the suburbs — but not to rent apartments in cities.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.public.asu.edu/~wplotkin/DeedsWeb/fha38.html "Racial" Provisions of FHA Underwriting Manual, 1938]'' &lt;blockquote&gt;Recommended restrictions should include provision for:
prohibition of the occupancy of properties '''except by the race for which they are intended''' …Schools should be appropriate to the needs of the new community and they should not be attended in large numbers by '''inharmonious racial groups'''. [[Federal Housing Administration]], Underwriting Manual: Underwriting and Valuation Procedure Under Title II of the [[National Housing Act]] With Revisions to February, 1938 (Washington, D.C.), Part II, Section 9, Rating of Location.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; White flight was made easier by state and federal governments paying for highways to carry suburbanites to work in cities where the jobs remained (the National Defense and Interstate Highway Act and its successors).&lt;ref&gt;''Locational Dimensions of Urban Highway Impact: An Empirical Analysis'' James O. Wheeler Geografiska Annaler. Series B, Human Geography, Vol. 58, No. 2 (1976), pp. 67-78&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of these highways in some cases divided and isolated black neighborhoods from goods and services, many times within industrial corridors. For example Birmingham’s interstate highway system attempted to maintain the racial boundaries that had been established by the city’s 1926 racial zoning law. The construction of interstate highways through black neighborhoods in the city led to significant population loss in those neighborhoods and is associated with an increase in neighborhood racial segregation.&lt;ref&gt;''From Racial Zoning to Community Empowerment: The Interstate Highway System and the African American Community in Birmingham, Alabama'' Charles E. Connerly Journal of Planning Education and Research, Vol. 22, No. 2, 99-114 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Blockbusting====
{{main|Blockbusting}}
Another important aspect of this migration was the phenomenon of "blockbusting." [[Real estate]] agents would facilitate the sale of a house in a white neighborhood to a black family by subterfuge, often buying the house themselves, or using a white proxy and reselling, perhaps at a reduced price, to the black family. A panic, fanned by the real estate agents and the media, would then ensue among some white homeowners, who feared that their property values would drop — which of course they did as soon as they began selling in large numbers, generating large commissions for the agents. The real estate agents would then sell at higher prices to the incoming black families, reaping the profits of the price difference as well as the sales commissions. It was not uncommon for the racial makeup of a neighborhood to be completely changed in the space of a few years by this process.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/147.html Blockbusting]'' - Encyclopedia of Chicago History&lt;/ref&gt;

====Urban decay====
{{main|Urban decay}}
[[Image:BrokenPromises_JohnFekner.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Broken Promises:[[John Fekner]] © 1980 Charlotte Street Stencils [[South Bronx]], New York. Though, it has since been revitalized the South Bronx became a famous example of urban decay and abandonment in the 70s and 80s.]]

Urban decay is a process by which a [[city]], or a part of a city, falls into a state of disrepair. It may be accelerated by white flight. It is characterized by [[depopulation]], property abandonment, high [[unemployment]], fragmented families, political [[disenfranchisement]], [[crime]], and desolate and unfriendly urban landscapes. Urban decay was associated with Western cities, especially [[North America]] and parts of [[Europe]] during the [[1970s]] and [[1980s]]. During this time period major changes in global economies, [[transportation]], and government policies created conditions that fostered urban decay&lt;ref&gt;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=uf0vS1A-0dkC Urban Sores: On the Interaction Between Segregation, Urban Decay, and Deprived Neighbourhoods]'' By Hans Skifter Andersen. ISBN 0754633055. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;. Many North American cities have experienced an outflux of population to city [[suburbs]] or [[Commuter town|exurbs]], as in the case of white flight.&lt;ref name="crabgrass"&gt;''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0195049837 Crabgrass Frontier: The Suburbanization of the United States]'' by Professor Kenneth T Jackson (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Other trends====
Several poorer predominantly white communities also face conditions similar to those of areas that have experienced white flight. The cities of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] in [[New York]] serve as prime examples. The 1960s saw significant white flight from the inner city of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] and smaller Ohio metropolitan areas, such as [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]] and [[Springfield, Ohio|Springfield]]. In these areas, manufacturing jobs were once dominant but have now largely disappeared, resulting in urban decay.

===Governmental aspects of white flight===
Due to the nature of American local governmental structure, white flight enabled people who moved into the suburbs to create new municipalities outside the jurisdiction of the original city, without any [[legacy costs]] of maintaining existing infrastructure. However, this was balanced by the need to enhance the suburban infrastructure to support the larger population. For instance, new schools, roads, water and sewer lines, and firehouses had to be built.

By the enactment of restrictive [[zoning]], these new entities could ensure that few poor (or in some cases middle-class) emigrants could afford to move into their enclaves. Such municipalities were incorporated by the hundreds on the peripheries of cities. The details, of course, varied according to state statutes and local politics. Milwaukee, for example, was able to annex parts of surrounding [[political subdivisions of Wisconsin|towns]], including the former [[Granville, Wisconsin|Town of Granville]] and thus expand to a greater extent than many landlocked cities (then-Mayor [[Frank P. Zeidler]] inveighed against the destructive effect of the "Iron Ring" of new municipalities incorporated in the post-World War II decade.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=459264 Mayor served 'the public welfare': Longtime city icon known for integrity, energy, principles]'' By ALAN J. BORSUK. Journal Sentinel. July 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;); at the same time, many semi-rural areas such as [[Oak Creek, Wisconsin|Oak Creek]], [[South Milwaukee, Wisconsin|South Milwaukee]] and [[Franklin, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Franklin]] incorporated to escape annexation during this era, after state laws were changed to allow such incorporation by non-urban regions near Milwaukee which did not fit the traditional minimum standards for incorporation.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Rast, "Governing the Regimeless City: The Frank Zeidler Administration in Milwaukee, 1948–1960," ''Urban Affairs Review'', Vol. 42, No. 1, 81-112 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald J. Curran, "Infra-Metropolitan Competition," ''Land Economics'', Vol. 40, No. 1 (Feb., 1964), pp. 94-99&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schools and busing===
{{main|Desegregation busing}}
White flight has also affected education. The landmark 1954 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' ordered the desegregation of schools. American cities affected by white flight also witnessed growing disparities in the quality of education. The Supreme Court subsequently mandated in the 1971 decision of ''[[Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education]]'' the institution of [[Forced busing|busing]] of black students to mainly formerly all-white schools in the suburbs, and vice versa.  Starting in the mid-1970s, some minority students (especially blacks) were transported miles from poorer core cities to newer affluent suburbs. As [[Justice William Douglas]] observed in his dissent in ''[[Milliken v. Bradley]]'' (1974), "The inner core of Detroit is now rather solidly black; and the blacks, we know, in many instances are likely to be poorer…" A similar 1977 Federal decision, ''Penick v The Columbus Board of Education,'' accelerated white flight from [[Columbus, Ohio]] to its suburbs. According to [[sociologist]] Cardell K. Jacobson, opposition to integration was strongest among people who did not themselves have children in public schools, and in particular among those who already had children in parochial schools.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, Cardell K., Desegregation Rulings and Public Attitude Changes: White Resistance or Resignation?, ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]'', v. 84 n. 3, pp. 698-705.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/09/09/BAIFS1GE4.DTL C.W. Nevius: Racism alive and well in S.F. schools - here's proof]&lt;/ref&gt;

Busing and desegregation orders in education had also in some cases led to a further, non-geographical white flight: out of the public school systems, which are subject to desegregation orders, and into private schools, which are not. For instance, in [[1970]], when a [[United States District Court for the Central District of California|federal court]] ordered desegregation of the public schools of the [[Pasadena Unified School District]] (in [[Pasadena, California]]), the proportion of white students in those schools reflected the proportion of whites in the community, 54 percent and 53 percent, respectively. After desegregation began, a large number of whites in the upper and middle classes could afford private schooling and so pulled their children from mixed public schools. As a result, by [[2004]] Pasadena was home to sixty-three private schools, which educated one-third of all school-aged children in the city, and the proportion of white students in the public schools had fallen to 16 percent. The superintendent of Pasadena USD characterized them as being to whites "like the bogey-man" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penfamilies.org/www/pen/Files/LA%20Daily%20Journal%20Article%20on%20Pasadena%20School%20Reform.doc]&lt;/ref&gt; and mounted policy changes and a publicity drive to induce affluent whites to put their children back into the public schools.

===White flight in recent decades===
Some parts of the [[New York]] and [[Los Angeles]] metropolitan areas with emerging [[Latin American]] and [[Asian]] populations are experiencing a new phenomenon where "white flight" neighborhoods that became mostly black in population are now experiencing a [[black flight]] by blacks as new immigrants move in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,2036580,00.html Diversity is our strenght]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackamericaweb.com/site.aspx/bawnews/stateof/hutchinson105 Rainbow Coalition]&lt;/ref&gt; A few noted parts of the [[New York City]] area experiencing this are much of [[the Bronx]] and some sections of the 3 cities on its northern border ([[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]], [[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon]], and [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]]), urban areas in [[Union County, New Jersey]] such as [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]], and (though only on the periphery of the area), parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] in [[Connecticut]]. 

In southern California, eastern [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], the eastern [[San Fernando Valley]], sections of the [[San Gabriel Valley]], sections of the [[Antelope Valley]] and sections of [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] and the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]] have been affected by white flight due to Latin American immigration.{{Fact|date=November 2007}} In [[Florida]] and [[Texas]], as in [[California]], the immigrant influx is creating a
[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic future]]. Since most of the [[White Americans]] leaving California have tended to be politically conservative&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002-10-28-gop-west-1acover_x.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] has historically been considered to be in a far stronger position among [[Latin American]] and [[Asian American|Asian]] immigrants, the large-scale immigration and white flight have helped to transform California into a stronghold of the Democratic Party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2007-06-27-hispanics-dems-cover_N.htm Hispanics turning back to Democrats for 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaldef.org/article.php?article_id=213 Exit Poll of 4,600 Asian American Voters Reveals Robust Support for Democratic Candidates in Key Congressional and State Races]&lt;/ref&gt;

====White flight in Southern California====
The forces and groups involved in white flight in Southern California are distinct from those in other areas due to the region's demography and history.  Many whites once lived in urban neighborhoods in Los Angeles before departing the city in large numbers after the [[1965]] [[Watts Riots]]. This trend actually began before the riots but it accelerated in their wake. The major [[12th Street Riot]] in Detroit in [[1967]] and during the following year, after the assassination of civil rights leader [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]], contributed to white flight in that city. Now, the city of Detroit is over 80% black whereas a majority of its neighboring suburbs, such as [[Livonia, Michigan|Livonia]], [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]], and [[Warren, Michigan|Warren]], are predominantly white.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/08/13/national/main306205.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;. Similarly, after the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]], large numbers of white Californians left Southern California or left the state entirely. The phenomenon has affected not only the central city basin, but also the suburban regions of the [[San Fernando Valley]] and the [[San Gabriel Valley]] in [[Southern California]], where many [[working class|working-class]] Latin Americans and lower to upper-middle class [[Asians]] have moved during much of the 1980s and 1990s.{{Fact|date=November 2007}} 

In addition, during the 1990s and 2000s, many blacks ([[black flight]]) have continued to move out of the historically African American communities such as [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] and [[Compton, California|Compton]] to inland communities such as [[Fontana, California|Fontana]], [[Rialto, California|Rialto]], [[Palmdale, California|Palmdale]], [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], and [[Ventura County]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollard-Terry, Gayle. "Where It's Booming: Watts." ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', October 16, 2005. Page E1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of white flight is also taking place in many parts of [[Northern California]], such as the western suburbs of [[San Jose, California]]. White flight, though taking place at a slower pace, is also affecting high-income upper-class neighborhoods that are becoming increasingly [[Asian American]].&lt;ref&gt;http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB113236377590902105-lMyQjAxMDE1MzEyOTMxNjkzWj.html&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, however, the white flight does not result in socio-economic problems for the affected communities. The influx of non-whites whose socio-economic status is at least as high, if not higher, than that of previous white residents compensates for the loss in white population. Furthermore this trend tends to affect upscale enclaves such as [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]], [[Saratoga, California|Saratoga]] or, in Southern California [[San Marino, California|San Marino]]. These cities are expected to have income grow significantly and become more upper-class than they are today.

==White flight outside the United States==
===South Africa===
The phenomenon is also found in [[South Africa]]n cities, most notably [[Johannesburg]], [[Pretoria]] and [[Durban]], which saw a mass influx of Black African people into the inner cities during the final years of [[apartheid]], and from which white people fled in great numbers to the suburbs (or out of the country altogether).{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

===New Zealand===
In some areas of [[New Zealand]], there has been a gradual process of white flight, in response to mass urbanisation of [[Māori]] and arrivals of [[Pacific Islander]] guest workers between the 1950s and 1970s, though in [[Auckland]] the process has largely been in reverse since the 1980s, with [[European New Zealander]]s moving to previously Māori and Pacific Islander neighbourhoods such as Ponsonby, Grey Lynn and Kingsland. Similar gentrification trends have occurred in [[Wellington]] inner city suburbs like Thorndon, Newtown, and Aro Valley. White flight has also significantly affected many areas of [[Rotorua]], with the phenomenon being blamed for the cities' slide into proverbial "Third World" conditions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzherald.co.nz/specialreport/story.cfm?c_id=1501094&amp;objectid=10392647&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zimbabwe===
In [[Zimbabwe]], after the introduction of "land redistribution" property seizure schemes and a wave of government-sponsored anti-white violence in 1999 and 2000, the majority of the country's white population abandoned the nation. The redistributed land was given to self-styled "war veterans" claiming relation to the 1965-1979 "war" for the country's independence.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

The redistribution plan has been an unqualified disaster; almost all of the country's commercial farms were seized and parceled into smaller plots for individual farmers, which reduced the land space available for farming (farmers had to erect home structures on each portion); this also disrupted irrigation and fertilization patterns. Most of the new farmers have no experience at the craft and lack the tools necessary for commercial farming, and as a result the country, which once counted agricultural products as its largest source of income, has experienced severe famine as arable farmland shifted into subsistence farming for the individual families.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], particularly [[England]], there is evidence of simultaneous ethnic minority dispersal and segregation: in the 1980s and 1990s, minority groups grew rapidly (in percentage terms) in many suburban neighbourhoods and smaller towns that were formerly almost devoid of non-whites, but minorities also grew strongly (in numerical terms) in the inner urban districts of first immigrant settlement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/02/10/nmig10.xml Whites leaving cities]&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, white populations in many of these urban centers declined, either because of [[counter urbanisation]] or, in some parts of the country, general regional decline.&lt;ref&gt;http://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/dps/case/CBCB/census2_part1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--how is this "white flight"?--&gt;

While many skilled [[working class]]/ [[lower middle class]] whites have moved out of the less desirable areas of east, southeast and west [[London]] to suburban communities in (respectively) [[Essex]], [[Kent]] and [[Surrey]], this has been tempered in central London by rapid gentrification. However, in outlying industrial areas such as [[London Borough of Newham|Newham]], [[Woolwich]] and [[Hounslow]], which are not seen as attractive to young professionals, demographics have been skewed to the extent that white people are in some cases a minority. This is a new phenomenon in urban Britain.

Industrial towns and cities with large south Asian populations such as [[Oldham]], [[Rochdale]], [[Nelson, Lancashire|Nelson]], [[Blackburn]] and [[Burnley]] in [[Lancashire]], [[Bradford]], [[Dewsbury]] and [[Keighley]] in [[West Yorkshire]], [[Slough]] in the [[South East England|South East]], and [[Leicester]] in the [[Midlands]] also show evidence of white flight. Ethnic minorities in these areas have experienced strong demographic growth (a result of young age structure, the high fertility of some minority groups, and continued immigration),&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4706862.stm Thousands in UK citizenship queue]&lt;/ref&gt; gradually expanding to new districts adjacent to their areas of first settlement. Meanwhile, white communities have been moving away from these older, less attractive urban centres to suburbs and small towns. However, whether segregation is increasing has been open to debate, with some arguing that as well as white families moving out of predominantly Asian areas, Asians themselves have started to move away as they become more established and affluent themselves.&lt;ref&gt; Dominic Casciani, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5304276.stm So who's right over segregation?], [[BBC News]] Magazine, 4 September 2006, accessed 21 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], comparable trends have taken place around the areas of Australia's greatest immigration inflows, particularly [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]]. In Sydney, [[Anglo-Celtic Australian]]s have left the [[South-western Sydney|south-western]] suburbs in response to growing concentrations of Asian immigrants, and have relocated to outer suburban areas, notably [[Penrith, New South Wales|Penrith]] and the northern coastal area of [[Gosford-Wyong]]. These growth areas have remained predominantly Anglo-Celtic.&lt;ref&gt;Birrell, Bob, and Seol, Byung-Soo. [http://elecpress.monash.edu.au/pnp/free/pnpv6n3/BirrSeol1.htm 'Sydney's Ethnic Underclass'], ''People and Place'', vol. 6, no. 3, September 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gentrification==
{{Main|Gentrification}}
The opposing social trend of wealthy social groups moving into an inner city area and displacing the existing residents is called [[gentrification]]. In [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], as reported on ''[[Newshour with Jim Lehrer]]'' on [[PBS]] in 2003, wealthy [[homosexual]] couples have purchased and restored homes in formerly predominantly black neighborhoods. This study echoed an earlier Ohio documentary titled Flag Wars,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbs.org/pov/pov2003/flagwars/special_gentrification.html&lt;/ref&gt; detailing similar black vs. gay (homophobia vs. racism) themes in the old silk stocking district of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. In [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], restoration in houses of a neglected neighborhood, pioneered by middle-income couples but followed by wealthier cohorts as property values and prices soar, has made the [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee|Brewers Hill]] district a byword for gentrification.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.jsonline.com/news/metro/may01/hill27052601a.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aux.uwm.edu/nho/in_the_news/news_articles/04.04.24Making_brewershill_afford.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, some inner city areas may witness a renaissance as a home for artists, which happens to be the case with the [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]] neighborhood of Los Angeles and (to a lesser extent) the [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee|Riverwest]] neighborhood of Milwaukee and the bohemian sections of the [[Ninth Ward of New Orleans|9th Ward]] of New Orleans.
