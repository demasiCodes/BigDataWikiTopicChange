'''''White flight''''' is the sociologic and [[Demographics|demographic]] term denoting the trend wherein [[white people]] flee [[desegregation|desegregated]] [[Urban area|urban]] communities, and move to other places like [[commuter town]]s;&lt;ref&gt;David J.

In the [[United States|U.S.]] the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] — ordering the ''[[de jure]]'' [[racial desegregation]] of public schools in the United States — was and remains a major factor propelling white flight from mixed-race cities.&lt;ref&gt;Charles T.

The business practices of [[redlining]], [[mortgage discrimination]], and racially-restrictive [[covenant]]s accelerated white flight to the suburbs.

White flight has occurred, and occurs, in most every U.S. city,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/20/AR2006082000629.html Growing diversity of American cities]'' By Anushka Asthana, Washington Post.

===History===
{{See also|Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration (African American)}}
After World War II, to avoid racial integration and cohabiting with [[Black American]]s, many [[White American]]s began fleeing the cities to racially-restricted new [[suburb]]s. In the cities, the housing shortages consequent to the influx of rural black workers for war-effort employment were aggravated by existing socio-economic inequalities and the automobile. Those social conditions propitiated white flight from town to country, which they believed was a better residence than the city. A condition moreover guaranteed via [[Covenants#Exclusionary_covenants|exclusionary covenants]] in title deeds and real estate neighborhood redlining&lt;ref&gt; [http://bellwether.metapress.com/content/h128812346540080/ Crossney and Bartelt 2005 Urban Geography][http://www.mi.vt.edu/data/files/hpd%20vol.16%20issues%203%20and%204/articles/hpd6(3,4)%20crossney.pdf Crossney and Bartelt 2006 Housing Policy Debate]&lt;/ref&gt; — explicit, legal racism and discriminatory lending–selling practices; thus Black Americans were economically disbarred from pursuing the [[American Dream]] in the suburbs, even when they could afford it.&lt;ref name="crabgrass" /&gt; Suburban expansion was mostly available to middle-class and working-class white people, and facilitated by their increased wages and federally-guaranteed mortgages (VA, FHA, HOLC) available only for white people to buy new houses, not rent apartments.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.public.asu.edu/~wplotkin/DeedsWeb/fha38.html "Racial" Provisions of FHA Underwriting Manual, 1938]'' &lt;blockquote&gt; Recommended restrictions should include provisions for: prohibition of the occupancy of properties '''except by the race for which they are intended''' . . . Schools should be appropriate to the needs of the new community, and they should not be attended in large numbers by '''inharmonious racial groups'''. [[Federal Housing Administration]], Underwriting Manual: Underwriting and Valuation Procedure Under Title II of the [[National Housing Act of 1934|National Housing Act]] With Revisions to February, 1938 (Washington, D.C.), Part II, Section 9, Rating of Location.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The roads built via the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956|National Interstate and Defense Highways Act]] (1956) and its successors, built to transport suburbanites to their city jobs, much aided white flight, and proportionately reduced the city’s supporting tax base, thus, consequently, beginning [[urban decay]].&lt;ref&gt;''Locational Dimensions of Urban Highway Impact: An Empirical Analysis'', by James O. Wheeler, “Geografiska Annaler”. Series-B, Human Geography, Vol. 58, No. 2 (1976) pp.67-78&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as in the [[Southern United States]], local governments used highway road constructions to deliberately divide and isolate [[black neighborhood]]s from goods and services, often within industrial corridors. In [[Birmingham, Alabama]], the local government used the post–World War II interstate highway system to perpetuate the racial residence-boundaries the city established with a 1926 racial zoning law. Constructing interstate highways through majority-black neighborhoods eventually reduced the populations to the poorest proportion of people financially unable to leave their destroyed community.&lt;ref&gt;''From Racial Zoning to Community Empowerment: The Interstate Highway System and the African American Community in Birmingham, Alabama'' Charles E. Connerly Journal of Planning Education and Research, Vol. 22, No. 2, pp.99-114 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Blockbusting====
{{Main|Blockbusting}}

The [[real estate]] business practice of “blockbusting” was a very important means of controlling non-white migration and aiding white flight for profit. By subterfuge, real estate agents would facilitate black people buying a house in a white neighborhood; either buying the house themselves, or via a white proxy buyer, and then re-selling it over-priced to the black family. The consequent racist panic among the remaining white inhabitants (aggravated by real estate agents and the local newsmedia fear-mongering)&lt;ref&gt;[Ford, Richard T. ''The race card : how bluffing about bias makes race relations worse''; New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2008; pp. 290-291]&lt;/ref&gt;, would psychologically coerce the remaining white inhabitants, fearing devalued residential property, to quickly sell, usually at a loss — a self-fulfilling prophecy realized when they began selling ''en masse'' — thus generating great sales commissions for the agents. In turn, the real estate agents would then sell at higher-than-market prices to the incoming black families, profiting from price [[arbitrage]] and the sales commissions from both the black and white victims of such [[fraud]]. Thereby, the racial composition of a neighborhood populace often changed completely in a few years.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/147.html Blockbusting]'' - Encyclopedia of Chicago History&lt;/ref&gt;

====Urban decay====
{{Main|Urban decay}}
[[Image:BrokenPromises JohnFekner.jpg|thumb|250px|right|&lt;small&gt;'''Urban decay in the US:'''&lt;/small&gt; the South Bronx, New York City, was exemplar of the federal and local governments’ abandonment of the cities in the 1970s and 1980s; the Spanish sign reads “FALSE PROMISES”, the English sign reads “BROKEN PROMISES”.]]

Urban decay is the sociological process whereby a city, or part of a city, falls into disrepair and decrepitude — [[depopulation]], [[economic restructuring]], abandoned buildings, high local [[unemployment]], fragmented families, political [[disenfranchisement]], [[crime]], and a desolate, inhospitable city landscape, white flight’s draining of a city’s tax base is one cause.

In the 1970s and 1980s, urban decay was associated with Western cities, especially in [[North America]] and parts of [[Europe]]. In that time, major structural changes in global economies, [[transportation]], and government policy created the economic, then social, conditions resulting in urban decay.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=uf0vS1A-0dkC Urban Sores: On the Interaction Between Segregation, Urban Decay, and Deprived Neighbourhoods]'', by Hans Skifter Andersen. ISBN 0754633055. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Urban decay contradicts the urban development of most of Europe and North America, in countries beyond, urban decay is manifest in the peripheral [[slum]]s at the outskirts of a metropolis, while the city center and the inner city retain high real estate values and sustain a steadily increasing population.&lt;ref name="crabgrass"&gt;''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0195049837 Crabgrass Frontier: The Suburbanization of the United States]'' by Professor Kenneth T Jackson (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

North American cities suffered white flight to the suburbs and exurb commuter towns, which &lt;ref name="crabgrass"/&gt; started to reverse in the 1990s, when the rich suburbanites returned to the city via gentrification of the decayed urban neighborhoods by over-paying for (and over-pricing) the real estate and so economically expelling the original poor inhabitants. [[Blight (urban)|Blight]] is another characteristic of urban decay — the visual, psychological, and physical effects of living among empty lots, and buildings and houses labelled “THIS PROPERTY IS CONDEMNED”. Such desolate properties are socially dangerous to the community because they attract criminals and [[street gang]]s, thus contributing to the volume of crime. Urban decay has no single cause; it results from combinations of inter-related socio-economic conditions — including the city’s [[urban planning]] decisions, strictly-enforced [[rent control]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} the [[poverty]] of the local populace, the construction of neighborhood-excluding [[freeway#effects and controversy|freeway]] roads and rail road lines,&lt;ref name="power"&gt;''[[The Power Broker]]: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York'', by [[Robert Caro]], p.522.&lt;blockquote&gt;The construction of the [[Gowanus Parkway]], laying a concrete slab on top of lively, bustling Third Avenue, buried the avenue in shadow, and when the parkway was completed, the avenue was cast forever into darkness and gloom, and its bustle and life were forever gone.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; depopulation by suburbanization of peripheral lands, real estate neighborhood redlining,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=TWo8OFJpFtAC How East New York Became a Ghetto] by Walter Thabit.

===Government-aided white flight===
The organization of municipal government in the U.S. facilitated white flight from racially diverse cities by establishing new municipalities beyond the abandoned city’s jurisdiction to avoid the [[legacy costs]] of maintaining city infrastructures, instead spending said taxes establishing the suburban infrastructures. The federal government contributed to white flight and the early decay of non-white city neighborhoods by withholding maintenance capital mortgages, thus making it difficult for the communities to either retain or attract middle-class residents.&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;''[[When Work Disappears]]: The World of the New Urban Poor'', by William Julius Wilson (1996) ISBN 0679724176&lt;/ref&gt;

The new suburban communities limited the emigration of poor and non-white residents from the city with restrictive [[zoning]], thus few lower middle-class people could afford a house in the suburbs. In the event, many all-white suburbs were incorporated to the cities they had fled. Milwaukee, Wisconsin, partially incorporated [[Political subdivisions of Wisconsin|towns]] such as [[Granville, Wisconsin]]; the (then) Mayor, [[Frank P. Zeidler]] complained about the societal destructive "Iron Ring" of new municipalities incorporated in the post–World War II decade.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=459264 Mayor served 'the public welfare': Longtime city icon known for integrity, energy, principles]'', by Alan J. Borsuk. “Journal Sentinel”, 8 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Analogously, semi-rural communities, such as [[Oak Creek, Wisconsin|Oak Creek]], [[South Milwaukee, Wisconsin|South Milwaukee]], and [[Franklin, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Franklin]], formally incorporated as discrete entities, to escape urban incorporation when Wisconsin state law allowed Milwaukee’s incorporation of such rural and sub-urban regions, that did not qualify for discrete incorporation, per the legal incorporation standards.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Rast, "Governing the Regimeless City: The Frank Zeidler Administration in Milwaukee, 1948–1960", ''Urban Affairs Review'', Vol. 42, No. 1, 81-112 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald J. Curran, "Infra-Metropolitan Competition", ''Land Economics'', Vol. 40, No. 1 (Feb., 1964), pp. 94-99&lt;/ref&gt;

===Desegregation: public schools and student busing===
{{Main|Desegregation busing}}

The post–World War II racial desegregation of U.S. society — especially of the public schools — catalyzed white flight from the cities to the suburbs. In 1954, the US Supreme Court ordered the ''de jure'' termination of the “separate, but equal” legal racism established with the ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896) case in the nineteenth century, thus, with the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) case, the Supreme Court ordered the racial desegregation of public schools, because the unequal funding of majority-black and majority-white public schools ensured that black people received an inferior public education despite paying taxes for it. In 1971, in the case of ''[[Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education]]'' (1971), the Supreme Court ordered the forced busing of poor black students to suburban white schools, and wealthy white students to poor schools in the city. In the case of ''[[Milliken v. Bradley]]'' (1974), the dissenting [[Justice William Douglas]] observed that “the inner core of Detroit is now rather solidly black; and the blacks, we know, in many instances are likely to be poorer. . . .” Like-wise, in 1977, the Federal decision in ''Penick v. The Columbus Board of Education'' (1977) accelerated white flight from Columbus, Ohio. The racial desegregation of schools and the racial integration of U.S. society were most opposed by white people whose children attended private schools, yet, the most vehement opponents of racial integration were white people whose children attended private, religious schools.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, Cardell K., “Desegregation Rulings and Public Attitude Changes: White Resistance or Resignation?”, ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]'', v.84 n.3, pp.698–705.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/09/09/BAIFS1GE4.DTL C.W. Nevius: Racism alive and well in S.F. schools - here's proof]&lt;/ref&gt;

A secondary, non-geographic consequence, of school desegregation and busing was ''cultural'' white flight: withdrawing white children from the mixed-race public school system and matriculating them to private schools unaffected by U.S. federal anti-racist laws. In 1970, when the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] ordered the [[Pasadena Unified School District]] desegregated, the white-student proportion (54%) of the schools approximately reflected the school district’s proportional white populace (53%).

Once the federally-ordered school desegregation occurred, whites who could afford private schools withdrew their children from the racially diverse [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] public school system. In result, by 2004, Pasadena had 63 private schools educating some 33% of schoolchildren, while white students made up only 16% of the public school populace. The Pasadena Unified School District superintendent characterized public schools as “like the bogey-man” to whites and implemented policies meant to persuade white parents to matriculate their children to the racially diverse Pasadena public school district.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penfamilies.org/www/pen/Files/LA%20Daily%20Journal%20Article%20on%20Pasadena%20School%20Reform.doc Tackling Local Resistance to Public Schools] By John Ryan&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, white flight rapidly altered the racial composition of public school systems; upon desegregation, in Baltimore, Maryland, the Clifton Park Junior High School had 2,023 white students and 34 black students; 10 years later, it had 12 white students and 2,037 black students. In northwest Baltimore, Garrison Junior High School’s student body declined from 2,504 whites and 12 blacks to 297 whites and 1,263 blacks in that period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcps.k12.md.us/About/History/From_the_Oldorder1.asp Reasons and Results 1957-1997&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent decades===
The New York City and Los Angeles metropolises now experience [[black flight]] consequent to the growing [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] and [[Asian American|Asian]] populations settling in traditionally Black American communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,2036580,00.html Diversity is our strength]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackamericaweb.com/site.aspx/bawnews/stateof/hutchinson105 Rainbow Coalition]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, the [[12th Street Riot]] of Detroit, Michigan, contributed to white flight, leaving contemporary Detroit more than 80 percent black, and most of its suburbs, including [[Livonia, Michigan|Livonia]], [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]], and [[Warren, Michigan|Warren]], predominantly white.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/08/13/national/main306205.shtml Most Racially Uniform Cities, - CBS News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of "White flight" in the United States took place in [[Miami]]. Indeed, the [[Mariel Boatlift]] of 1980 brought 150,000 Cubans (mostly poor "non-white hispanics") to Miami, the largest in US civilian history. During this time, many of the middle class non-Hispanic whites in the community left the city. As a consequence, while in 1960 Miami was 90% non-Hispanic white, by 1990 it was only about 10% non-Hispanic white.&lt;ref&gt;[[Miami, Florida]] Wikipedia article, retrieved January 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Southern California====
{{Citations missing|date=February 2008}}

In [[Southern California]], white flight from [[Los Angeles]] was occurring before the racial [[Watts Riots]] in 1965, the violence of which aggravated the matter of residence. Like-wise, the [[Los Angeles riots of 1992]] provoked [[black flight]] ''and'' white flight from the governmentally-neglected city. Moreover, in [[California]], and in the [[Western United States|western U.S.]], Americans of Latin American descent are the greatest racial minority, thus, as their populace increased so increased the white flight to the suburbs comprehended by [[Metropolitan area|metropolitan]] Los Angeles. During the 1990s and early 2000s, Black Americans continued emigrating from the historically black communities of [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]], [[Compton, California|Compton]], which now have mostly Latino populaces, especially to [[Inland Empire, California]] communities such as [[Fontana, California|Fontana]], [[Rialto, California|Rialto]], [[Moreno Valley, California|Moreno Valley]], [[Palmdale, California|Palmdale]], [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], and [[Ventura County]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollard-Terry, Gayle. “Where It's Booming: Watts”, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 16 October 2005. p.E-1.&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[black flight]].)

In [[San Diego]], the white flight of the 1950s caused many white people who lived in southern parts of the city such as (South San Diego, East Side San Diego, and [[South East San Diego]]) to move up to neighborhoods in the norther part of [[San Diego County]]. As a result of this the majority of the neighborhoods south of the [[I-8]] are predominantly [[Latino]], [[African-American]], or [[Filipino people|Filipino]].

====Northern California====
{{Citations missing|date=February 2008}}
Since 1980, in the states west of Texas, [[San Francisco]] and [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] are the only major U.S. cities whose white populations increased — despite Oakland having the largest Black populace (30% versus 50% per the 1980 census); thus, after sixty years of having been a predominantly Black American city, the [[gentrification]] begun in the 1990s changed the demographic composition of Oakland. Most of the Asian American populace of the San Francisco bay area live in [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]], San Jose, Santa Clara, the [[east Bay]], [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma]], and [[Napa Valley]], not the city proper. The non-white proportions — 20 percent black and 40 percent Latino — of the [[Social conservative|socially conservative]] capital city of Sacramento (38% white) are greater than the comparable proportions of [[Social liberal|socially liberal]] San Francisco.

==White flight world-wide==
===Australia===
In [[Australia]], white flight occurred in the cities where most immigrants, usually Asian, settled, especially [[Sydney]], from where [[Anglo-Celtic Australian]]s have fled from the [[South-Western Sydney]] suburbs, because of the increased non-white populace, and have moved to peripheral metropolitan suburbs, notably [[Penrith, New South Wales]] and the northern coast of [[Gosford]]–[[Wyong]]. These white flight destination suburbs remain predominantly white (Anglo-Celtic).&lt;ref&gt;Birrell, Bob, and Seol, Byung-Soo.

===Ireland===
Non-white immigration to [[Ireland]] at the twentieth century’s end provoked white flight from [[Dublin]] to the island's interior and peripheral suburbs, which an economist described as “unprecedented white flight”. In 2006, the Central Statistic Office forecast that white flight would continue.&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2006/03/26/story12901.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Also, international and Irish news media reported an emerging pattern of indigenous Irish self-segregation centered upon Gaeilge ([[Irish language]]) schools in reaction against the increased percentages of non-white and foreign immigrant pupils matriculated to Dublin schools.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/19/europe/EU-GEN-Ireland-White-Flight.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1853128,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Netherlands===
Since 2004, and especially after the Muslim assassination of the artist [[Theo van Gogh]], many Dutch people are fleeing [[the Netherlands]], and emigrating to Australia, New Zealand, and [[Canada]]. Aggravating the high-population density stresses, the rise of inter-ethnic violence and crime between the indigenous Dutch people and non-white immigrants are cited as motives for white flight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/12/11/wneth11.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/12/11/ixworld.html Dutch desert their changing country]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/27/international/europe/27dutch.html?_r=1&amp;ex=1110171600&amp;en=d6582f891be6b650&amp;ei=5070 More Dutch Plan to Emigrate as Muslim Influx Tips Scales]&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
From the 1950s to the 1970s, white flight in areas of [[New Zealand]] was a gradual reaction to the mass urbanization of [[Māori]] natives and Pacific island guest workers. In [[Auckland]], white flight mostly has reversed since the 1980s, with [[European New Zealander]]s residing in neighborhoods that previously had non-white (Māori and Pacific Islander) populaces such as Ponsonby, Grey Lynn, and Kingsland. Contemporarily, those previously non-white city neighborhoods and the CBD are amongst the most expensive, desirable real estate in Auckland and New Zealand. Similar [[gentrification]] has occurred in [[Wellington]] inner city neighborhoods of Thorndon, Newtown, and Aro Valley.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

===South Africa===
South African white flight, notably from the cities of [[Johannesburg]], [[Pretoria]], and [[Durban]], was a reaction to the interior immigration of Black South Africans to the cities as the legal racism of [[apartheid]] ended. In the event, [[White South African]]s fled either to the suburbs, or emigrated from racially [[integration|integrated]] [[South Africa]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

===United Kingdom===
[[Trevor Phillips]], head of the UK [[Commission for Equalities and Human Rights]], and Mike Poulsen, an Australian academic, have claimed that [[White British|White Britons]] and non-white Britons are becoming more segregated, however, researchers Ceri Peach, Danny Dorling, and Ludi Simpson have argued that segregation in the UK is either stable or declining.&lt;ref&gt; Dominic Casciani, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5304276.stm So who's right over segregation?], [[BBC News]] Magazine, 4 September 2006, accessed 21 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Demographic data indicate trends of simultaneous ethnic minority dispersal and segregation.

In his opinion, these trends indicate [[counter urbanization]] rather than white flight.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccsr.ac.uk/research/mrpd/RaceMigBook.html Simpson, L.
