This article features the history of the representation of [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]] and [[queer]] ([[LGBTQ]]) characters in animated productions under [[The Walt Disney Company]], including films from the studios [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] and [[Pixar]], and programming from the [[Disney Branded Television]] channels as well as the streaming service [[Disney+]]. 
From 1983 onward, Disney struggled with LGBTQ representation in their animated series, and their content often included [[LGBT stereotypes|LGBTQ stereotypes]]&lt;ref name="craig2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="insidersnydes" /&gt; or the content was censored in series which aired on [[Toon Disney]] such as ''[[Blazing Dragons]]''.&lt;ref name="short2021" /&gt; Some creators have also criticized [[Disney Entertainment|Disney studio]] executives of cutting LGBTQ scenes from their shows in the past,&lt;ref name="bitchmedia.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bitchmag2021" /&gt; or criticized that their shows were not seen as part of the "Disney brand", like ''[[The Owl House]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zogbi|first=Emily|url=https://www.cbr.com/owl-house-creator-disney-exec-brand-fit/|title=Owl House Was Canceled Due To Exec Deciding It Didn't Fit the Disney Brand|website=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=October 5, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211005225255/https://www.cbr.com/owl-house-creator-disney-exec-brand-fit/|archive-date=October 5, 2021|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deja supervised animation for those characters, with some noting the [[campy]] value of these characters.&lt;ref name="kunze2022" /&gt; The fact that Deja had also worked on [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]] in ''[[The Lion King]]'' and the titular character in ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'', for example, has been discussed as an influence on the development of some Disney characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=Gail | last1=Dines | first2=Jean | last2=McMahon Humez | title=Gender, Race, and Class in Media: A Text-reader | page=[https://archive.org/details/genderraceclassi0000unse/page/209 209] | date=August 2002 | publisher=Sage Publications | isbn=978-0-7619-2261-2 | url=https://archive.org/details/genderraceclassi0000unse/page/209 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Peter | last=Schweizer | title=The Mouse Betrayed | page=[https://archive.org/details/disneymousebetra00schw/page/148 148] | publisher=Regnery Publishing | date=September 1998 | isbn=0-89526-387-4 | url=https://archive.org/details/disneymousebetra00schw/page/148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a June 1994 article in [[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]], an executive producer of ''The Lion King'', [[Thomas Schumacher]], a gay man, argued that there were "a lot of gay people at every level" of Disney, and called it a "very supportive environment". He noted that he brought his partner, Matt White, to an annual company beach party and long company retreats and that while some executives were uncomfortable with Schumacher bringing his partner, higher executives didn't give him any trouble. Schumacher also said that while he regretted handing over reins of the film to [[Don Hahn]], he was proud of songs by [[Tim Rice]], a lyricist, and [[Elton John]] in the film. ''The Advocate'' noted that even if there aren't any openly gay or lesbian characters in the film, there is sensitivity to LGBTQ issues in the upper echelon of Disney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Tom | last=Provenzano | title=The Lion in Summer | journal=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] | pages=64–71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L2MEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA71 |date=June 28, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This queer coding had its disadvantages, with networks not wanting to show overt representation. [[Rebecca Sugar]] argued that it is really heavy for a kid to only exist as a villain or a joke in an animated series.&lt;ref name="insidersnydes" /&gt; In 2011, Deja told [[news.com.au]] Disney would have a "family that has two dads or two mums" if they find the "right kind of story with that kind of concept."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Daniela | last=Elser | title=Gay families in Disney movies only a matter of time, says Lion King animator Andreas Deja | url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/mickey-has-two-dads/story-e6frfmvr-1226015944009 | date=March 4, 2011 | journal=[[news.com.au]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807101046/http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/mickey-has-two-dads/story-e6frfmvr-1226015944009|archive-date=August 7, 2011|url-status=live|access-date=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other critics criticized such queer-coded villains as contributing to homophobic discourse and equating queerness with evil itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gates |first1=Meggie |title=Once Again, Disney Attempts to Co-opt Pride Month |url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/disney-rebrands-pride-no-lgbtq-support |website=[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]] |access-date=September 28, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210712054914/https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/disney-rebrands-pride-no-lgbtq-support |archive-date=July 12, 2021 |date=July 18, 2021 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weir |first1=John |title=FILM; Gay-Bashing, Villainy and the Oscars |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/29/movies/film-gay-bashing-villainy-and-the-oscars.html |website=[[New York Times]] |access-date=September 29, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210122220051/https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/29/movies/film-gay-bashing-villainy-and-the-oscars.html |archive-date=January 22, 2021 |date=March 29, 1992 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Peter C. Kunze argued that Ashman was recruited by Disney from [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], saying that while working with [[Alan Menken]], he crafted songs in ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989), ''Beauty and the Beast'' and ''Aladdin''. Kunze noted that Ashman and animators on ''The Little Mermaid'' were inspired by [[gay culture]] and [[gay icons]]. He also pointed out that Ashman was supported by [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] after coming out as [[HIV-positive people|HIV-Positive]], with the company even creating a production unit near his home so he could receive treatment in [[New York City]] rather than traveling to [[Burbank, California]], with ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' dedicated to him. Kunze further noted that Albert Tavares, a gay man, [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)#Casting|oversaw casting]] on ''The Little Mermaid''.&lt;ref name="kunze2022" /&gt;

In 2006, ''[[Brother Bear II]],'' directed by [[Benjamin Gluck]], who is openly gay, explores themes of diversity and personal transformation. The film portrays Nita’s transformation into a bear, which is met with unconditional support from her father, who affirms, “I will love you no matter what you choose,” highlighting the importance of acceptance and love across differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/Animation_Magazine_September_2006/page/20/mode/2up | title=Animation Magazine September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melissa Etheridge]], inspired by the film, wrote three original songs for the soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hometheaterforum.com/community/threads/htf-review-brother-bear-2-honestly-recommended.239003/ {{Bare URL inline|date=August 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2021, [[Kelly Marie Tran]], the voice actress of Raya in the film ''[[Raya and the Last Dragon]]'', argued that Raya is queer, stating that she believed there were "some romantic feelings" between Raya and Namaari in the story. She later made clear that this isn't the official Disney position and hoped for a Disney warrior that is "openly in the LGBTQ community" in the future, perhaps even a person who is [[disabled]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Robinson |first1=Joanna |title=Raya and the Last Dragon's Kelly Marie Tran Thinks Her Disney Princess Is Gay |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/03/raya-and-the-last-dragon-kelly-marie-tran-gay-namaari-raya |website=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |access-date=March 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210307025741/https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/03/raya-and-the-last-dragon-kelly-marie-tran-gay-namaari-raya |archive-date=March 7, 2021 |date=March 5, 2021 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In June 2021, ''[[Luca (2021 film)|Luca]]'' was released on [[Disney+]].

In April 2022, Peter C. Kunze, a historian at [[Tulane University]] argued that there is a "long history of LGBTQ audiences and employees supporting, even saving, the company from veritable demise." He also said that Disney relied on LGBTQ people to "revamp its animated films", taking the example of [[Howard Ashman]], an openly gay man who was the lyricist for ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' and ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''. Kunze argued that Disney CEO [[Bob Chapek]] should remember the company's history and "understand the invaluable contributions LGBTQ communities have made to the company he leads."&lt;ref name="kunze2022"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kunze|first=Peter|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/04/22/lbgtq-audiences-artists-helped-save-disney/|title=LBGTQ audiences and artists helped save Disney|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=April 22, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220422110450/https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/04/22/lbgtq-audiences-artists-helped-save-disney/|archive-date=April 22, 2022|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Censorship===
Disney executives did not always receive LGBTQ characters and relationships positively. They, for instance, axed a proposed lesbian relationship in ''[[Gravity Falls]]'', at the same time that ''[[The Amazing World of Gumball]]'', a series on Disney's competitor [[Cartoon Network]], was censored for supposed "homosexual overtones" by various countries. The former [[National Expert Commission of Ukraine on the Protection of Public Morality]]  advised in 2012 the banning of [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]] on the grounds that it promoted homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Manzella"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Manzella |first1=Sam |title=9 Cartoons That Were Censored For Being Too Gay |url=http://www.newnownext.com/gay-cartoons-censored/02/2018/ |website=[[Logo TV]] |access-date=March 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200318042826/http://www.newnownext.com/gay-cartoons-censored/02/2018/ |archive-date=March 18, 2020 |date=February 27, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2021, David Levine, a former Disney executive who oversaw kids programming for 16 years, said that "a lot of conservative opinion" driving depictions of characters of the [[Disney Channel]], [[Cartoon Network]], and [[Nickelodeon]], with no hope for LGBTQ representation, saying he still has similar conversations to this day.&lt;ref name="whiteinsider2021"/&gt;

A show created by [[Terry Jones]] and [[Gavin Scott]], ''[[Blazing Dragons]]'', aired on [[Teletoon]] in Canada, [[Spacetoon]] in [[Arab countries]], and [[Canal+ (French TV channel)|Canal+]] in France from 1996 to 1998. In the series, Sir Blaze is a member of the Square Table, and is flamboyant and effeminate. Throughout the series, he is implied to be gay.

The episode from the original ''[[The Proud Family|Proud Family]]'' series "[[List of The Proud Family episodes#ep51|Who You Calling a Sissy]]" was pulled from the network after its initial airing on August 12, 2005, as a result of regarding Michael's sexual orientation while frequently being called a "sissy" at the time. The ban was lifted in 2020 as the episode is available to stream on Disney+. In February 2021, [[Ralph Farquhar]] revealed that in ''[[The Proud Family]]'', which aired on the [[Disney Channel]] from 2001 to 2005, they had to use "code to talk about if Michael was gay, to talk about sexuality" and to be "sort of underhanded about it." He said this changed with ''[[The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder]]'' with the biggest changes to the show were "gender identity, obviously racial identity and quote-unquote wokeness," and said that sexuality can be "sort of in your face with it a lot more," manifesting itself in the storytelling. [[Bruce W.

After ''Lightyear'' performed poorly at the box office, Pixar was alleged to have attributed the financial failure to the same-sex kiss. This resulted in modifications being enforced during production of ''[[Inside Out 2]]'' to make the character of Riley seem "less gay", to the point of making modifications to lighting in scenes in which she is seen interacting with her friend Val, despite Riley having not been intended to be gay in the first place.

Several crew members, like storyboarder Derrick Malick Johnson, asserted on [[social media]] that Disney decided not to air the episode because of "which party that won the recent election" which likely referred to the victory of [[Donald Trump]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in the [[2024 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|url=https://www.polygon.com/news/479614/disney-reportedly-pulls-marvels-moon-girl-and-dinosaur-episode-over-trans-athlete-story|title=Disney reportedly pulls Marvel's Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur episode over trans athlete story|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=November 15, 2024|access-date=November 15, 2024|archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/FfoSa|archive-date=November 15, 2024|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bsky.app/profile/aworkersignited.bsky.social/post/3lax2ijxcrk2y|title=Disappointing is an understatement.

On October 5, 2021, in an [[r/IAmA|AMA]] on [[Reddit]], Dana Terrace, the creator of ''[[The Owl House]]'', explained the show was cancelled not because of [[Television content rating system#United States|ratings]] or the [[Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on The Walt Disney Company|COVID-19 pandemic]], but rather because business people at Disney believed it did not fit "into the Disney brand." She stated that this was the case due to the serialized nature of the show and an audience which "skews older," rather than due to its LGBTQ+ representation, saying she wouldn't "assume bad faith" against those she works within [[Los Angeles]]. She also noted that due to the pandemic, budgets were constrained, episodes were cut, and noted that she wasn't allowed to present a case for a fourth season, and said she believed there was a future for the show if [[Disney Television Studios]] had "different people in charge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zogbi|first=Emily|url=https://www.cbr.com/owl-house-creator-disney-exec-brand-fit/|title=Owl House Was Canceled Due To Exec Deciding It Didn't Fit the Disney Brand|website=[[Comic Book Resources|CBR]]|date=October 5, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211005225255/https://www.cbr.com/owl-house-creator-disney-exec-brand-fit/|archive-date=October 5, 2021|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
