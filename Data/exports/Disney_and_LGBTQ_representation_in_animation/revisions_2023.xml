The [[Disney Channel]], which launched in 1983, [[Disney XD]], which began in 2009, [[Disney Junior]], which launched in 2011, and shows on [[Disney+]], along with the short-lived [[Toon Disney]], have all occasionally featured [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) characters in their programming.

From 1983 onward, Disney struggled with LGBTQ representation in their animated series, and their content often included [[LGBT stereotypes]]&lt;ref name="craig2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="insidersnydes" /&gt; or the content was censored in series such as ''[[Blazing Dragons]]''.&lt;ref name="short2021" /&gt; Some reviewers have argued that when Disney and [[Cartoon Network]] are compared in terms of [[Cartoon Network and LGBT representation|such representation]], it is "easy to see who actually cares about LGBT representation."&lt;ref name="Sampey"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sampey|first1=Mori|date=March 30, 2020|title=The rise of queer representation in LGBT cartoons|url=https://www.thevermilion.com/opinion/disneys-first-lgbt-character-is-a-fluke-cartoon-network-prevails-in-representation/article_f9c85bd4-6976-11ea-bb90-a7ca875b5209.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200402225554/https://www.thevermilion.com/opinion/disneys-first-lgbt-character-is-a-fluke-cartoon-network-prevails-in-representation/article_f9c85bd4-6976-11ea-bb90-a7ca875b5209.html|archive-date=April 2, 2020|access-date=August 24, 2020|website=The Vermillion|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some creators have also criticized Disney studio executives of cutting LGBTQ scenes from their shows in the past,&lt;ref name="bitchmedia.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bitchmag2021" /&gt; or criticized that their shows were not seen as part of the "Disney brand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zogbi|first=Emily|url=https://www.cbr.com/owl-house-creator-disney-exec-brand-fit/|title=Owl House Was Canceled Due To Exec Deciding It Didn't Fit the Disney Brand|website=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=October 5, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211005225255/https://www.cbr.com/owl-house-creator-disney-exec-brand-fit/|archive-date=October 5, 2021|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He noted that he brought his partner, Matt White, to an annual company beach party and long company retreats and that while some executives were uncomfortable with Schumacher bringing his partner, higher executives didn't give him any trouble. Schumacher also said that while he regretted handing over reins of the film to [[Don Hahn]], he was proud of songs by [[Tim Rice]], a lyricist, and [[Elton John]] in the film. ''The Advocate'' noted that even if there aren't any openly gay or lesbian characters in the film, there is sensitivity to LGBTQ issues in the upper echelon of Disney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Tom | last=Provenzano | title=The Lion in Summer | journal=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] | pages=64–71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L2MEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA71 |date=June 28, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This queer coding had its disadvantages, with networks not wanting to show overt representation. [[Rebecca Sugar]] argued that it is really heavy for a kid to only exist as a villain or a joke in an animated series.&lt;ref name="insidersnydes" /&gt; In 2011, Deja told [[news.com.au]] Disney would have a "family that has two dads or two mums" if they find the "right kind of story with that kind of concept."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Daniela | last=Elser | title=Gay families in Disney movies only a matter of time, says Lion King animator Andreas Deja | url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/mickey-has-two-dads/story-e6frfmvr-1226015944009 | date=March 4, 2011 | journal=[[news.com.au]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807101046/http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/mickey-has-two-dads/story-e6frfmvr-1226015944009|archive-date=August 7, 2011|url-status=live|access-date=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other critics criticized such queer-coded villains as contributing to homophobic discourse and equating queerness with evil itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gates |first1=Meggie |title=Once Again, Disney Attempts to Co-opt Pride Month |url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/disney-rebrands-pride-no-lgbtq-support |website=[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]] |access-date=September 28, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210712054914/https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/disney-rebrands-pride-no-lgbtq-support |archive-date=July 12, 2021 |date=July 18, 2021 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weir |first1=John |title=FILM; Gay-Bashing, Villainy and the Oscars |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/29/movies/film-gay-bashing-villainy-and-the-oscars.html |website=[[New York Times]] |access-date=September 29, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210122220051/https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/29/movies/film-gay-bashing-villainy-and-the-oscars.html |archive-date=January 22, 2021 |date=March 29, 1992 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Peter C. Kunze argued that Ashman was recruited by Disney from [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], saying that while working with [[Alan Menken]], he crafted songs in ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989), ''Beauty and the Beast'' and ''Aladdin''. Kunze noted that Ashman and animators on ''The Little Mermaid'' were inspired by [[gay culture]] and [[gay icons]]. He also pointed out that Ashman was supported by [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] after coming out as [[HIV-positive people|HIV-Positive]], with the company even creating a production unit near his home so he could receive treatment in [[New York City]] rather than traveling to [[Burbank, California]], with ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' dedicated to him.

A show created by [[Terry Jones]] and [[Gavin Scott]], ''[[Blazing Dragons]]'', aired on [[Teletoon]] in Canada, [[Spacetoon]] in [[Arab countries]], and [[Canal+]] in France from 1996 to 1998. In the series, Sir Blaze is a member of the Square Table, and is flamboyant and effeminate. Throughout the series, he is implied to be gay.

Shang Li was not included in the 2020 [[Mulan (2020 film)|live-action remake]] of ''Mulan''.

The episode from the original ''[[The Proud Family|Proud Family]]'' series "[[List of The Proud Family episodes#ep51|Who You Calling a Sissy]]" was pulled from the network after its initial airing on August 12, 2005, as a result of regarding Michael's sexual orientation while frequently being called a "sissy" at the time. The ban was lifted in 2020 as the episode is available to stream on Disney+. [[Ralph Farquhar]] revealed that in ''[[The Proud Family]]'', which aired on the [[Disney Channel]] from 2001 to 2005, they had to use "code to talk about if Michael was gay, to talk about sexuality" and to be "sort of underhanded about it." He said this changed with ''[[The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder]]'' with the biggest changes to the show were "gender identity, obviously racial identity and quote-unquote wokeness," and said that sexuality can be "sort of in your face with it a lot more," manifesting itself in the storytelling. [[Bruce W. Smith]] also said that the show has more than "just one gay person...representing the entire LGBTQ+ spectrum" and said that it is "not fair" to only have one LGBTQ character in the series.&lt;ref name="Wolfe"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfe|first=Jennifer|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/the-proud-family-returns-to-screens-louder-prouder-even-more-authentic/|title='The Proud Family' Returns to Screens Louder, Prouder &amp; Even More Authentic!|website=[[Animation Magazine]]|date=February 4, 2022|access-date=February 4, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220204183522/https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/the-proud-family-returns-to-screens-louder-prouder-even-more-authentic/|archive-date=February 4, 2022|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barry and Randell kiss in the episode "Father Figures".

In his tweet, which was retweeted thousands of times he urged people to "mercilessly" spam the executives by saying there is "room for everyone under the rainbow" if the executives claim LGBTQ+ characters are not "Disney appropriate."&lt;ref name="bitchmedia.org"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gates |first1=Meggie |title=Making Waves: In "Luca" and "Wolfwalkers," Monstrousness Is a Queer Metaphor |url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/luca-wolfwalkers-animated-childrens-films-explore-queerness |website=[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]] |access-date=September 28, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210728185954/https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/luca-wolfwalkers-animated-childrens-films-explore-queerness |archive-date=July 28, 2021 |date=July 28, 2021 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bitchmag2021"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gates |first1=Meggie |title=Once Again, Disney Attempts to Co-opt Pride Month |url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/disney-rebrands-pride-no-lgbtq-support |website=[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]] |access-date=September 28, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210712054914/https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/disney-rebrands-pride-no-lgbtq-support |archive-date=July 12, 2021 |date=June 18, 2021 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2021, ''[[Luca (2021 film)|Luca]]'' was released on [[Disney+]]. Some argued that the film felt "gay" even if not "explicitly queer," and more ambiguous, comparing it to the 2017 live-action film ''[[Call Me by Your Name (film)|Call Me by Your Name]]'' and the 2020 animated film ''[[Wolfwalkers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Nick|last=Romano|date=April 28, 2021|access-date=April 23, 2022|title=Is 'Luca' Pixar's 'Call Me by Your Name'?

On July 10, 2021, ''The Owl House'' episode "Through the Looking Glass Ruins" premiered on the Disney Channel. One reviewer, Mey Rude said that the episode pushes forward the relationship between Luz and Amity, with Amity putting her job as a [[librarian]] in jeopardy to help Luz, while the latter goes through trials to get Amity her job back, and Amity kissing Luz on the cheek.&lt;ref name="rudeout2021"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rude|first=Mey|url=https://www.out.com/television/2021/7/12/owl-houses-luz-amity-just-had-their-gayest-episode-yet|title=The Owl House's Luz &amp; Amity Just Had Their Gayest Episode Yet|website=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]|date=July 12, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210712220742/https://www.out.com/television/2021/7/12/owl-houses-luz-amity-just-had-their-gayest-episode-yet|archive-date=July 12, 2021|access-date=July 12, 2021|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rude also noted that the LGBTQ characters in the show are "fleshed-out characters," pointed out the episode, directed by Bo Coburn, was co-written by [[Molly Ostertag]] and Terrace, with the former writing "[[Enchanting Grom Fright]]" and "Wing It Like Witches." That episode was co-written by Rachel Vine. Another reviewer described the episode as delivering a "definitive message that love transcends gender even in the world of children's animation."&lt;ref name="kinjad2021"/&gt; The same reviewer also said that fans shouldn't look to "giant corporations for continual queer representation" and expressed their frustration at the end of ''The Owl House'' after its third season airs.

On October 3, 2021, one of the creators of ''[[The Ghost and Molly McGee]]'', Bob Roth, said there is LGBTQ representation in the show, which starts small and later includes main characters, and urged fans to "let it unfold naturally."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet |last=Roth |first=Bob |user=automaticgravy |number=1444708477520072705 |date=October 3, 2021 |title=Anyway, yes, it'll take a while.

On October 5, 2021, in an [[r/IAmA|AMA]] on [[Reddit]], Dana Terrace, the creator of ''[[The Owl House]]'', explained the show was cancelled not because of [[Television content rating system#United States|ratings]] or [[Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on The Walt Disney Company|COVID-19 pandemic]] but rather because business people at Disney believed it did not fit "into the Disney brand." She stated that this was the case due to the serialized nature of the show and an audience which "skews older," rather than due to its LGBTQ+ representation, saying she wouldn't "assume bad faith" against those she works within [[Los Angeles]]. She also noted that due to the pandemic, budgets were constrained, episodes were cut, and noted that she wasn't allowed to present a case for a fourth season, and said she believed there was a future for the show if [[Disney Television Studios|Disney Television]] had "different people in charge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zogbi|first=Emily|url=https://www.cbr.com/owl-house-creator-disney-exec-brand-fit/|title=Owl House Was Canceled Due To Exec Deciding It Didn't Fit the Disney Brand|website=[[Comic Book Resources|CBR]]|date=October 5, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211005225255/https://www.cbr.com/owl-house-creator-disney-exec-brand-fit/|archive-date=October 5, 2021|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and expanded representation==
Disney executives did not always receive LGBTQ characters and relationships positively. They, for instance, axed a proposed lesbian relationship in ''[[Gravity Falls]]'', at the same time that ''Gumball'' was censored for supposed "homosexual overtones" by various countries, and the [[National Expert Commission of Ukraine on the Protection of Public Morality]] in Ukraine advised the banning of [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]] on the grounds that it promoted homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Manzella"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Manzella |first1=Sam |title=9 Cartoons That Were Censored For Being Too Gay |url=http://www.newnownext.com/gay-cartoons-censored/02/2018/ |website=[[Logo TV]] |access-date=March 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200318042826/http://www.newnownext.com/gay-cartoons-censored/02/2018/ |archive-date=March 18, 2020 |date=February 27, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkinson"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Atkinson |first1=Sophia |title=The Complete History of Queer Characters in Cartoon Shows |url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/2015/11/09/queer-cartoons-history/ |website=[[Highsnobiety]] |publisher=TITEL MEDIA GMBH |access-date=March 28, 2020 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200328182444/https://www.highsnobiety.com/2015/11/09/queer-cartoons-history/ |archive-date=March 28, 2020 |date=November 5, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Disney has been criticized for its approach to LGBTQ representation as compared to [[Cartoon Network]].&lt;ref name="Sampey" /&gt; In June 2021, David Levine, a former Disney executive who oversaw kids programming for 16 years, said that "a lot of conservative opinion" driving depictions of characters of the [[Disney Channel]], [[Cartoon Network]], and [[Nickelodeon]], with no hope for LGBTQ representation, saying he still has similar conversations to this day.&lt;ref name="whiteinsider2021"/&gt;

In April 2022, Peter C. Kunze, a historian at [[Tulane University]] argued that there is a "long history of LGBTQ audiences and employees supporting, even saving, the company from veritable demise." He also said that Disney relied on LGBTQ people to "revamp its animated films", taking the example of [[Howard Ashman]], an openly gay man who was the lyricist for ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' and ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''. Kunze argued that Disney CEO [[Bob Chapek]] should remember the company's history and "understand the invaluable contributions LGBTQ communities have made to the company he leads."&lt;ref name="kunze2022"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kunze|first=Peter|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/04/22/lbgtq-audiences-artists-helped-save-disney/|title=LBGTQ audiences and artists helped save Disney|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=April 22, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220422110450/https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/04/22/lbgtq-audiences-artists-helped-save-disney/|archive-date=April 22, 2022|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social conservatism|Conservatives]] have criticized Disney for being a part of a "modern revolt against traditional views of marriage, sex, gender, and family".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disney goes for broke on woke|url=https://albertmohler.com/2022/04/30/disney-goes-for-broke-on-woke-the-entertainment-giant-pulls-back-the-curtain-on-its-enthusiastic-embrace-of-all-things-lgbtq}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Congressman]] [[Scott Perry (politician)|Scott Perry]] stated that Disney's opposition to the Florida Parental Rights in Education Act "exposes its disturbing effort to push the radical left's toxic '[[woke]]' agenda on our country's most vulnerable, our young children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Republicans pile on criticism of 'woke' Disney's 'indoctrination' of children|url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/republicans-criticize-woke-disney-indoctrination-children}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative film critic Sebastian James stated that Disney films imbued with sexual complexity are going to perplex children leaving them "lost and confused". He added that Disney should go back to "producing great content, family films which champion what is good, true, beautiful, and universal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Woke Disney Company is turning its back on family values|url=https://mercatornet.com/the-woke-disney-company-is-turning-its-back-on-family-values/80299/|author=Sebastian James}}&lt;/ref&gt;
