'''Social conservatism''' is the belief that society is built upon a fragile network of relationships which need to be upheld through duty, traditional values and established institutions.{{sfn|Heywood|2017|p=69}} This can include [[morality|moral]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ngcgV7nUBdQC&amp;pg=PA166|title=Social Resilience in the Neoliberal Era|last=Hall|first=Peter A.|last2=Lamont|first2=Michèle|date=22 April 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781107034976|location=|page=166|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social conservatism is generally skeptical of [[social change]], and believes in maintaining the [[status quo]] concerning social issues such as [[familialism|family life]], sexual relations, and patriotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dahms|first1=Harry F.|title=Mediations of Social Life in the 21st Century|date=2014|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|isbn=9781784412227|page=101|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=C5V1BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social conservatism encompasses a range of what may be thought of as [[reactionary]] positions on social issues.&lt;ref name="Farney"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farney|first1=James Harold|title=Social Conservatives and Party Politics in Canada and the United States|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9781442612600|page=|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=odcZbJnUN3cC&amp;pg=PA13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It developed as a reaction to what was perceived as dangerous tendencies within the [[liberalism|liberal]] movements toward [[political radicalism]] and a wholesale rejection of "traditional values".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservatism - By Branch / Doctrine - The Basics of Philosophy|url=http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_conservatism.html|website=www.philosophybasics.com|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, since the mid to late 20th century, social conservatism arose as a response to federal action on social issues—such as [[civil rights movement|civil rights]], the abolition of the [[death penalty]], [[LGBT rights]] and [[abortion]]—which members perceived as a threat to conservative values and societal order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Riley|first1=Jim|title=Liberalism &amp; Conservatism|url=http://academic.regis.edu/jriley/libcons.htm|website=academic.regis.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Farney"/&gt; Social conservatives also value the influence of religion in the public sphere, thus supporting [[Christian state|state Churches]] or [[accommodationism]], while opposing secularism and [[state atheism]].&lt;ref name="Dean2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dean|first=John W.|title=Conservatives Without Conscience|date=11 July 2006|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|language=English|isbn=9781101201374|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WaldCalhoun-Brown2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wald|first1=Kenneth D.|last2=Calhoun-Brown|first2=Allison|title=Religion and Politics in the United States|year=2007|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|language=English|isbn=9780742540415|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social conservatism and other ideological views ==
There is no necessary link between social and [[fiscal conservatism]];{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} some social conservatives such as [[George W. Bush]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3184 |title="Conservative" Bush Spends More than "Liberal" Presidents Clinton, Carter |authors=Veronique de Rugy and Tad DeHaven |publisher=Cato.org |date=31 July 2003 |accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael Gerson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/29/AR2008012902212.html |title=Michael Gerson - Compassionate to the End |work=Washington Post|date= 30 January 2008|accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; are otherwise [[apolitical]], [[Centrism|centrist]] or [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] on economic and fiscal issues. Social conservatives may sometimes support [[Economic interventionism|economic intervention]] where the intervention serves moral or cultural aims. Many social conservatives support a balance between [[fair trade]] and a [[free market]]. This concern for material welfare, like advocacy of traditional [[mores]], will often have a basis in religion. Examples include the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]], the [[Family First Party]] and [[Katter's Australian Party]], and the [[Communitarianism|communitarian]] movement in the United States.

There is more overlap between social conservatism and [[paleoconservatism]], in that they both have respect for traditional social forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rowland|first1=Howard S.|title=Things to Think About|date=2010|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=9781453571286|page=171|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NFi3g3qSfsAC&amp;pg=PA171|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

Social conservatism is not to be confused with [[Economic interventionism|economically interventionist]] conservatism, where conservative ideas are combined with [[Keynesian]] economics and a [[welfare state]], which is practised by some European conservatives, e.g. [[one-nation conservatism]] in Britain or [[Gaullism]] in France.

==Social conservatism in different countries==

===Islamic world===
{{Further|Sharia|Conservatism in Islam}}
Most Muslim countries are socially and morally conservative (such as [[Sudan]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Gambia]]) due to their interpretation of Islamic law also known as Shariah.

'''Arab world'''
{{Further|Arab world|Islam|Censorship}}
The Arab world has been historically conservative in social and moral issues due to the strong influence of Islam. All Arab countries have strong censorship laws against illicit and immoral content.

'''Arab States of the Persian Gulf'''
{{Further|Gulf Cooperation Council|House of Saud|House of Thani|House of Khalifa|House of Sabah|Al Said|Al Nahyan family}}
Saudi Arabia is the home of Islam and its two holy shrines, the king's ([[Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]]) title is "[[Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques]]". Saudi Arabia's role in the [[Islamic world]] enforces it to adhere to strict interpretation of Islam, of which it follows the most strict [[madhab]] of Islamic jurisprudence imam [[Hanbal]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===India===

'''Hindu social conservatism'''
{{Further|Shiv Sena|Bharatiya Janata Party|Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|Hindu nationalism|Hindutva}}
Hindu social conservatism in India in the twenty first century has developed into an influential movement. Represented in the political arena by the [[Right-wing politics|right-leaning]] [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] and [[Far-right politics|far-right wing]] [[Shiv Sena]]. Hindu social conservatism, also known as the [[Hindutva]] movement, is spearheaded by the voluntary non-governmental organisation [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]]. The core philosophy of this ideology is [[nativism (politics)|nativism]] and sees [[Hinduism]] as a national identity rather than a religious one. Due to an inclination towards [[nativism (politics)|nativism]], much of its platform is based on the belief that Islamic and Christian denominations in India are the result of occupations, and therefore these groups should not receive concessions from the state.&lt;ref name=bunch&gt;M S Golwalkar (1966), Bunch of thoughts, Publishers: Sahitya Sindhu Prakashana&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of political positions, Hindu social conservatives in India seek to institutionalise a [[Uniform civil code of India|Uniform Civil Code]] (which is also a directive under Article 44 of the [[Constitution of India]]) for members of all religions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Press Trust of India |url=http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=23591 |title=Muslim leaders oppose uniform civil code |publisher=Express India |date=2 August 2003 |accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; over the current scheme of different personal laws for different religions. For instance, [[polygamy]] is legal for Muslims in India but not Hindus.

'''Muslim social conservatism'''
{{Further|Lakshar-e-Taiba}}
There are several socially conservative Muslim organisations in India, ranging from groups such as the [[Indian Union Muslim League]] which aim to promote the preservation of Indian Muslim culture as a part of the nation's identity and history.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

===Canada===
{{Main|Social conservatism in Canada}}

In Canada, social conservatism, though widespread, is not as prominent in the public sphere as [[social conservatism in the United States|in the United States]]. It is prevalent in all areas of the country but is seen as being more prominent in [[rural]] areas. It is also a significant influence on the ideological and political culture of the provinces of [[Saskatchewan]], [[Alberta]], and [[British Columbia]] as they were largely settled by American immigrants in the 19th century.

Compared to [[social conservatism in the United States]], social conservatism has not been as influential in Canada. The main reason is that the [[neoliberal]] or [[neoconservative]] style of politics as promoted by leaders such as former Liberal Party of Canada Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]] and Former Conservative Party of Canada Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] have focused on economic conservatism, with little or no emphasis on moral or social conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;John Middlemist Herrick and Paul H. Stuart, eds. ''Encyclopedia of social welfare history in North America'' (2005) p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Without a specific, large political party behind them, social conservatives have divided their votes and can be found in all political parties.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Haskell, ''Through a lens darkly: how the news media perceive and portray evangelicals'' (2009) p 57&lt;/ref&gt;

Social conservatives often felt that they were being sidelined by officials in the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] and its leadership of so-called "[[Red Tories]]" for the last half of the twentieth century and therefore many eventually made their political home with parties such as the [[Social Credit Party of Canada]] and the [[Reform Party of Canada]]. Despite the Reform Party being dominated by social conservatives, leader [[Preston Manning]], seeking greater national support for the party, was reluctant for the party to wholly embrace socially conservative values. This led to his deposition as leader of the party (now called [[Canadian Alliance]]) in favor of social conservative [[Stockwell Day]].&lt;ref&gt;Murray Dobbin, ''Preston Manning and the Reform Party'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; The party's successor, the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], despite having a number of socially conservative members and cabinet ministers, has chosen so far not to focus on socially conservative issues in its platform. This was most recently exemplified on two occasions in 2012 when the current [[Conservative Party of Canada]] declared they had no intention to repeal [[same-sex marriage]] or [[abortion]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/01/13/same-sex-marriages-declared-legal-and-valid-by-justice-minister-rob-nicholson/|title=Same-sex marriages declared legal and valid by federal justice minister Rob Nicholson|date=13 January 2012|work=National Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===

Social conservatism had a huge place in [[Apartheid]] South Africa ruled by the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]]. [[Television in South Africa]] was not introduced until 1976 out of fear that it would reduce the influence of Afrikaans.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  Pornography,&lt;ref&gt;JCW Van Rooyen, Censorship in South Africa (Cape Town: Juta and Co., 1987),&lt;/ref&gt; gambling&lt;ref&gt;Bet and board in the new South Africa.

Despite the legalisation of same-sex marriage and polygamy, in modern-day South Africa, the population remains socially conservative on issues such as homosexuality with 80% of the population against homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sacsis.org.za/site/article/440.1|title=South Africa's Social Conservatism: A Real and Present Danger|author=Dale T. McKinley|work=SACSIS.org.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
{{Main|Social conservatism in the United States}}

Social conservatism in the [[United States]] is a [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] political ideology that opposes [[progressivism|social progressivism]]. It is centered on the preservation of what adherents often call 'traditional' or '[[family values]]', though the accepted aims of the movement often vary amongst the organisations it comprises, making it hard to generalise about ideological preferences. There are, however, a number of general principles to which at least a majority of social conservatives adhere, such as [[Anti-abortion movements|opposition to abortion]] and opposition to [[same-sex marriage]].

The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] is the largest political party with socially conservative ideals incorporated into its platform. Other socially conservative parties include the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]] and the [[Prohibition Party]].

Social conservatives are strongest in the South, where they are a mainstream political force with aspirations to translate those ideals using the party platform nationally. In recent decades, the supporters of social conservatism played a major role in the political coalitions of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;Darren Dochuk, ''From Bible Belt to Sun Belt: Plain-Folk Religion, Grassroots Politics, and the Rise of Evangelical Conservatism'' (W.W. Norton &amp; Company; 2010) shows how migrants to Southern California from Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas provided evangelical support for social conservatism.&lt;/ref&gt;
