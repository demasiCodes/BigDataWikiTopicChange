{{conservatism }}

'''Social conservatism''' is a political or moral ideology that believes the government has a role in encouraging or enforcing traditional values or behaviors based on the belief that these are what keep people civilized and decent. However, the accepted meaning of traditional morality often differs from group to group within social conservatism. Thus, there are really no policies or positions that could be considered universal among social conservatives. There are, however, a number of principles to which at least a majority of social conservatives adhere.

A second meaning of the term has developed in the [[Nordic countries]] and [[Continental Europe]]. Here it refers to [[liberal conservatism|liberal conservatives]] supporting modern European [[welfare state]]s. 

__TOC__
Social conservatism is distinct from [[cultural conservatism]] which focuses on cultural aspects of the issues, such as protecting one's culture. Although there are some overlaps. 

Social conservatives in many countries generally:
* favor the [[pro-life]] position in the [[abortion controversy]]
* oppose expansion of [[civil marriage]] and [[child adoption]] rights to couples in homosexual relationships
* promote [[public morality]] and traditional [[family values]]
* promote the [[nuclear family]] model as society's foundational unit
* oppose [[secularism]] and privatization of religious belief

== Social conservatism and economic systems ==
There is no necessary link between social and [[fiscal conservative|fiscal conservatism]]. In fact, some social conservatives are otherwise apolitical or even [[left-wing]] on fiscal issues. For example, social conservatives may also support a degree of government intervention in the economy, and as such will tend to support the concept [[economic intervention]] to further this aim. This concern for material welfare, like advocacy of traditional [[mores]], will often have a basis in the religion of the social conservatives in question.  Examples include the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]], the [[Family First]] and [[Democratic Labor Party]] of [[Australia]], and the [[Communitarian]] movement in the United States.

There is more overlap between social conservatism and [[Paleoconservative|paleoconservatism]] in that they both have respect for traditional social forms. However, paleoconservatism has a strong [[cultural conservatism|cultural conservative]] strain which social conservatism, in and of itself, is not necessarily allied with. For example, John Burger, writing in ''[[Crisis Magazine]]'' in 2005, said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''The presence of a significant population of culturally Catholic immigrants offers hope that their culture will permeate a decadent American society and contribute to the re-evangelization of native-born Catholics. . . Abortion is still illegal in most [[Latin America]]n countries. And in most areas, it’s not even part of a person’s consciousness''." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.crisismagazine.com/julaug2005/burger.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Social conservatism and confessionalism ==
Many [[Christian Democracy|Christian Democratic Parties]] and [[Islamic party|Muslim parties]] around the world are socially conservative.

== Social conservatism and nationalism ==
In Europe, some social conservative parties also support [[nationalism]], [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalism]] and to a certain extent [[xenophobia]], based on ideas according to which the national wealth and the traditional values would lose from free [[immigration]] and [[free trade]]. 

However, these positions are contradictory with Christian religious beliefs and repetitively criticized by representatives of Catholic and Protestant churches. Dominant conservative parties, also called ''moderate right'' parties refrain from nationalism, trying to integrate citizens from ethnic minorities.
