{{conservatism }}
'''Social conservatism''' is a political or moral ideology that believes government and/or society have a role in encouraging or enforcing traditional values or behaviors based on the belief that these are what keep people civilized and decent. A second meaning of the term ''social conservatism'' developed in the [[Nordic countries]] and [[continental Europe]]. There it refers to [[liberal conservatism|liberal conservatives]] supporting modern European [[welfare state]]s. Social conservatism is distinct from [[cultural conservatism]] which focuses on cultural aspects of the issues, such as protecting one's culture, although there are some overlaps. 

The accepted meaning of traditional morality often differs from group to group within social [[conservatism]]. Thus, there are really no policies or positions that could be considered universal among social conservatives. There are, however, a number of principles to which at least a majority of social conservatives adhere. Social conservatives in many countries generally: favor the [[pro-life]] position in the [[abortion controversy]] and oppose [[embryonic stem cell]] research; support the [[death penalty]] for murder; oppose [[same-sex marriage]] and other marriages social conservatives consider the establishment of to be contrary to traditional marriage; and the [[nuclear family]] model as society's foundational unit; oppose expansion of [[civil marriage]] and [[child adoption]] rights to couples in [[same-sex relationship]]s; promote [[public morality]] and traditional [[family values]]; oppose [[secularism]] and privatization of religious belief; support the prohibition of [[Prohibition (drugs)|drugs]], [[prostitution]], [[premarital sex]],  [[extramarital sex|non-marital sex]] and [[euthanasia]]; and support the [[censorship]] of [[pornography]] and what they consider to be [[obscenity]] or [[indecency]].

Most [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] parties around the world are socially conservative.

==Social conservatism and economics==
There is no necessary link between social and [[fiscal conservatism]]; some social conservatives{{Who|date=August 2009}} are otherwise apolitical, centrist or even arguably [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] on economic and fiscal issues. Social conservatives may support a degree of [[economic intervention]]. Many Social Conservatives support the fair market i.e. a free market with labour, social and environmental considerations. This concern for material welfare, like advocacy of traditional [[mores]], will often have a basis in religion. Examples include the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]], the [[Family First Party]] and [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] of [[Australia]], and the [[Communitarianism|communitarian]] movement in the United States.

There is more overlap between social conservatism and [[Paleoconservative|paleoconservatism]], in that they both have respect for traditional social forms. However, paleoconservatism has a strong [[Cultural conservatism|cultural conservative]] strain which social conservatism, in and of itself, is not necessarily allied with. John Burger, wrote in ''[[Crisis (magazine)|Crisis]]'' magazine in 2005: "The presence of a significant population of culturally Catholic immigrants offers hope that their culture will permeate a decadent American society and contribute to the re-evangelization of native-born Catholics... Abortion is still illegal in most [[Latin America]]n countries. And in most areas, it's not even part of a person’s consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crisismagazine.com/julaug2005/burger.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
