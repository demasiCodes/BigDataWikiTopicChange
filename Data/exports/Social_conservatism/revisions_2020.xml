'''Social conservatism''' is a [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] political ideology which places emphasis on traditional power structures over [[Cultural pluralism|social pluralism]], and seeks to "reverse or stem the direction of change".&lt;ref name="Wiener 1973"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiener|first=Jonathan|author-link=Jon Wiener|date=Spring 1973|title=Review: ''The Politics of Unreason: Right-Wing Extremism in America, 1790-1970''|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/202704|journal=The Journal of Interdisciplinary History|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|volume=3|issue=4|pages=791{{ndash}}793|doi=10.2307/202704|jstor=202704|via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social conservatism in North America rose in the late 1900s as a reaction to the economic insecurity of lower-class [[Protestant]] Americans, [[McCarthyism]] and other [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigration]] ideologies, and the organisation and politicisation of social issues.&lt;ref name="Wiener 1973" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Riley|first1=Jim|title=Liberalism &amp; Conservatism|url=http://academic.regis.edu/jriley/libcons.htm|website=academic.regis.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farney|first1=James Harold|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=odcZbJnUN3cC&amp;pg=PA13|title=Social Conservatives and Party Politics in Canada and the United States|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9781442612600|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sociologist [[Harry F. Dahms]] suggests that social conservatism relates to a "commitment" to traditional values concerned with [[familialism|family structures]], [[sexual relations]], [[patriotism]], [[gun ownership]] and [[Military invasion|military invasions]], describing Christian doctrinal conservatives ([[Anti-abortion movement|anti-abortion]], [[List of Christian denominational positions on homosexuality|anti-gay marriage]]) and gun-use conservatives (pro-[[NRA]]) as the two domains of ideology within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-first=Robert B. |author-last=Smith |title=Social Conservatism, Distractors, and Authoritarianism: Axiological versus instrumental rationality |editor=Harry F.

== Social conservatism and other ideological views ==
Some social conservatives such as [[George W. Bush]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3184 |title="Conservative" Bush Spends More than "Liberal" Presidents Clinton, Carter |authors=Veronique de Rugy and Tad DeHaven |publisher=Cato.org |date=31 July 2003 |accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael Gerson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/29/AR2008012902212.html |title=Michael Gerson - Compassionate to the End |work=Washington Post|date= 30 January 2008|accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; are otherwise [[apolitical]], [[Centrism|centrist]] or [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] on economic and fiscal issues. Social conservatives may sometimes support [[Economic interventionism|economic intervention]] where the intervention serves moral or cultural aims. Historian [[Jon Wiener]] has described social conservatism as historically the result of an appeal from "[[Elite|elitist preservationists]]" to lower-class workers to 'protect' wealth from immigration.&lt;ref name="Wiener 1973" /&gt; Many social conservatives support a balance between [[protectionism]] and a [[free market]]. This concern for material welfare, like advocacy of traditional [[mores]], will often have a basis in religion. Examples include the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]], the [[Family First Party]] and [[Katter's Australian Party]], and the [[Communitarianism|communitarian]] movement in the United States.

There is more overlap between social conservatism and [[paleoconservatism]], in that they both have respect for traditional social forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rowland|first1=Howard S.|title=Things to Think About|date=2010|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=9781453571286|page=171|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NFi3g3qSfsAC&amp;pg=PA171|language=en}}{{self-published source|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

Social conservatism is not to be confused with [[Economic interventionism|economically interventionist]] conservatism, where conservative ideas are combined with [[Keynesian]] economics and a [[welfare state]], which is practised by some European conservatives, e.g. [[one-nation conservatism|one-nation conservatives]] in Britain or [[Gaullism|Gaullists]] in France.

==Social conservatism by country ==
{{More citations needed section|date=January 2013}}

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Social conservatism in Canada}}

In Canada, social conservatism, though widespread, is not as prominent in the public sphere as [[social conservatism in the United States|in the United States]]. It is prevalent in all areas of the country but is seen as being more prominent in [[rural]] areas. It is also a significant influence on the ideological and political culture of the western provinces of [[Manitoba]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Alberta]], and [[British Columbia]].{{cn|date=October 2020}}

Compared to [[social conservatism in the United States]], social conservatism has not been as influential in Canada. The main reason is that the [[neoliberal]] or [[neoconservative]] style of politics as promoted by leaders such as former Liberal Party of Canada Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]] and Former Conservative Party of Canada Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] have focused on [[fiscal conservatism]], with little or no emphasis on moral or social conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;John Middlemist Herrick and Paul H. Stuart, eds. ''Encyclopedia of social welfare history in North America'' (2005) p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Without a specific, large political party behind them, social conservatives have divided their votes and can be found in all political parties.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Haskell, ''Through a lens darkly: how the news media perceive and portray evangelicals'' (2009) p 57&lt;/ref&gt;

Social conservatives often felt that they were being sidelined by officials in the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] and its leadership of so-called "[[Red Tories]]" for the last half of the twentieth century and therefore many eventually made their political home with parties such as the [[Social Credit Party of Canada]] and the [[Reform Party of Canada]]. Despite the Reform Party being dominated by social conservatives, leader [[Preston Manning]], seeking greater national support for the party, was reluctant for the party to wholly embrace socially conservative values. This led to his deposition as leader of the party (now called [[Canadian Alliance]]) in favor of social conservative [[Stockwell Day]].&lt;ref&gt;Murray Dobbin, ''Preston Manning and the Reform Party'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; The party's successor, the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], despite having a number of socially conservative members and cabinet ministers, has chosen so far not to focus on socially conservative issues in its platform. This was most recently exemplified on two occasions in 2012 when the current [[Conservative Party of Canada]] declared they had no intention to repeal [[same-sex marriage]] or [[abortion]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/01/13/same-sex-marriages-declared-legal-and-valid-by-justice-minister-rob-nicholson/|title=Same-sex marriages declared legal and valid by federal justice minister Rob Nicholson|date=13 January 2012|work=National Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic world===
{{Further|Sharia|Conservatism in Islam}}
Most Muslim countries are somewhat more socially conservative (such as [[Sudan]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Gambia]]) than neighbouring countries that are not Muslim. However, due to their interpretation of Islamic law also known as Shariah, they differ from social conservatism as understood in Western nations.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

==== Arab world ====
{{Further|Arab world|Islam|Censorship}}
The Arab world has recently been more conservative in social and moral issues due to the rising influence of Western liberalism.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

===India===
==== Hindu social conservatism ====
{{Further|Shiv Sena|Bharatiya Janata Party|Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|Hindu nationalism|Hindutva}}
Hindu social conservatism in India in the twenty first century has developed into an influential movement. Represented in the political arena by the [[Right-wing politics|right-leaning]] [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]. Hindu social conservatism, also known as the [[Hindutva]] movement, is spearheaded by the voluntary non-governmental organisation [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]]. The core philosophy of this ideology is [[nativism (politics)|nativism]] and sees [[Hinduism]] as a national identity rather than a religious one. Due to an inclination towards [[nativism (politics)|nativism]], much of its platform is based on the belief that Islamic and Christian denominations in India are the result of occupations, and therefore these groups should not receive concessions from the state.&lt;ref name=bunch&gt;M S Golwalkar (1966), Bunch of thoughts, Publishers: Sahitya Sindhu Prakashana&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of political positions, Hindu social conservatives in India seek to institutionalise a [[Uniform civil code of India|Uniform Civil Code]] (which is also a directive under Article 44 of the [[Constitution of India]]) for members of all religions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Press Trust of India |url=http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=23591 |title=Muslim leaders oppose uniform civil code |publisher=Express India |date=2 August 2003 |accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; over the current scheme of different personal laws for different religions. For instance, [[polygamy]] is legal for Muslims in India but not Hindus.

==== Muslim social conservatism ====
{{Further|Lakshar-e-Taiba}}
There are several socially conservative Muslim organisations in India, ranging from groups such as the [[Indian Union Muslim League]] which aim to promote the preservation of Indian Muslim culture as a part of the nation's identity and history.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

=== South Africa ===

McKinley|work=SACSIS.org.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
{{Main|Social conservatism in the United States}}

Social conservatism in the [[United States]] is a [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] political ideology that opposes [[progressivism|social progressivism]]. It is centered on the preservation of what adherents often call 'traditional' or '[[family values]]', though the accepted aims of the movement often vary amongst the organisations it comprises, making it hard to generalise about ideological preferences. There are, however, a number of general principles to which at least a majority of social conservatives adhere, such as [[Anti-abortion movements|opposition to abortion]] and opposition to [[same-sex marriage]].

The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] is the largest political party with socially conservative ideals incorporated into its platform. Other socially conservative parties include the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]] and the [[Prohibition Party]].

Social conservatives are strongest in the South, where they are a mainstream political force with aspirations to translate those ideals using the party platform nationally. In recent decades, the supporters of social conservatism played a major role in the political coalitions of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;Darren Dochuk, ''From Bible Belt to Sun Belt: Plain-Folk Religion, Grassroots Politics, and the Rise of Evangelical Conservatism'' (W.W. Norton &amp; Company; 2010) shows how migrants to Southern California from Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas provided evangelical support for social conservatism.&lt;/ref&gt;
