{{conservatism }}
'''Social conservatism''' is a political or moral ideology that believes government and/or society have a role in encouraging or enforcing what they consider traditional values or behaviors. A second meaning of the term ''social conservatism'' developed in the [[Nordic countries]] and [[continental Europe]]. There it refers to [[liberal conservatism|liberal conservatives]] supporting modern European [[welfare state]]s. Social conservatism is distinct from [[cultural conservatism]] which focuses on cultural aspects of the issues, such as protecting one's culture, although there are some overlaps. 

The accepted meaning of traditional morality often differs from group to group within social [[conservatism]]. Thus, there are really no policies or positions that could be considered universal among social conservatives. There are, however, a number of principles to which at least a majority of social conservatives adhere. Social conservatives in many countries generally: favor the [[pro-life]] position in the [[abortion controversy]]; oppose all forms of and wish to ban [[embryonic stem cell research]] ; oppose both [[Eugenics]] (inheritable genetic modification) and [[human enhancement]] ([[Transhumanism]]) while supporting [[Bioconservatism]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utne.com/2005-01-01/TheNextDigitalDivide.aspx?page=2 The Next Digital Divide] (utne article)&lt;/ref&gt;; support a traditional definition of marriage as being one man and one woman; view the [[nuclear family]] model as society's foundational unit; oppose expansion of [[civil marriage]] and [[child adoption]] rights to couples in [[same-sex relationship]]s; promote [[public morality]] and traditional [[family values]]; oppose [[secularism]] and privatization of religious belief; support the prohibition of [[Prohibition (drugs)|drugs]], [[prostitution]], [[premarital sex]],  [[extramarital sex|non-marital sex]] and [[euthanasia]]; and support the [[censorship]] of [[pornography]] and what they consider to be [[obscenity]] or [[indecency]].

==Social conservatism and other ideological views==
There is no necessary link between social and [[fiscal conservatism]]; some social conservatives{{Who|date=August 2009}} are otherwise apolitical, centrist or [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] on economic and fiscal issues. Social conservatives may support a degree of [[economic intervention]]. Many Social Conservatives support the fair market i.e. a free market with labour, social and environmental considerations. This concern for material welfare, like advocacy of traditional [[mores]], will often have a basis in religion. Examples include the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]], the [[Family First Party]] and [[National Party of Australia]], and the [[Communitarianism|communitarian]] movement in the United States.

There is more overlap between social conservatism and [[Paleoconservative|paleoconservatism]], in that they both have respect for traditional social forms. However, paleoconservatism has a strong [[Cultural conservatism|cultural conservative]] strain which social conservatism, in and of itself, is not necessarily allied with.

==Social conservatism and American political parties==
In American politics, the [[Republican Party (United States)]] is the largest political party with socially conservative ideals incorporated into its platform.  Voters who are concerned with socially conservative issues often support the Republican Party, although there are also socially-[[Conservative Democrat]]s who break ranks with the party platform.  Despite this, there have been instances where the Republican Party's Nominee has been considered too socially progressive by social conservatives.  This has led to the support of third party candidates whose philosophies more closely parallel that of Social Conservatism. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/29/sarah-palin-republican-bi_n_337782.html/ huffingtonpost news story on NY23]&lt;/ref&gt;  While many social conservatives see third parties as a viable option in such a situation, some high-profile social conservatives see the excessive support of them as dangerous.  This fear arises from the possibility of [[vote splitting]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/03/09/romney-to-tea-party-dont-split-conservative-vote/ Romney tells Tea Party not to split vote]&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this would be if a Republican who is moderately socially-conservative is considered too progressive on social issues to be supported.  A third party candidate (such as [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]]), who is more socially conservative, would then be backed by a faction of the social conservatives.  In the resulting general election, the social-conservatives split the conservative voting bloc between the center-right Republican and third-party candidate, thus allowing the socially progressive Democrat to attain the relative majority (plurality) of the popular vote.  Social Conservatives, like any other interest-group, usually must find a balance between pragmatic electability and ideological principles when supporting candidates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/02/14/politics/main3829928.shtml?source=RSSattr=HOME_3829928/ Third Party Alternative to McCain] (Although no third party siphoned any significant percentage from McCain, such voter sentiment truly existed during the campaign)&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentator Randall Hoven of ''The American Thinker'' has remarked, "Using the ''National Journal''s ratings of Senators in 2007, the correlation coefficient between "economic" scores and "social" scores is 90%. That means they almost always go together; financial conservatives are social conservatives and ''vice versa''".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanthinker.com/2008/11/a_libertarian_defense_of_socia.html&lt;/ref&gt;
