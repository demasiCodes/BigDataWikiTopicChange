{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''Xenophobia''' is the fear and distrust of that which is perceived to be foreign or strange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/xenophobia?q=xenophobia |title=Xenophobia – definition of xenophobia in English from the Oxford dictionary |work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/xenophobia |title=Xenophobia – Define Xenophobia at Dictionary.com |work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophobia can involve [[perception]]s of an [[ingroup]] towards an [[Outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]] and can manifest itself in suspicion of the activities of others, and a desire to eliminate their presence to secure a presumed purity and may relate to a fear of losing national, ethnic or racial identity.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Guido Bolaffi. ''Dictionary of race, ethnicity and culture''. SAGE Publications Ltd., 2003. Pp. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophobia is a political term and not a recognized medical [[phobia]].{{Needs citation|date=September 2018}}

Xenophobia can also be exhibited in the form of an "uncritical exaltation of another culture" in which a culture is ascribed "an unreal, stereotyped and exotic quality".&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; The terms xenophobia and [[racism]] are sometimes confused and used interchangeably because people who share a national origin may also belong to the same [[race (human classification)|race]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO – Xenophobia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/international-migration/glossary/xenophobia/ |title=Xenophobia |publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, xenophobia is usually distinguished by opposition to foreign culture.&lt;ref name="UNESCO – Xenophobia" /&gt;

== Definitions ==
Dictionary definitions of ''xenophobia'' include: "deep-rooted fear towards foreigners" (Oxford English Dictionary; OED), and "fear of the unfamiliar" (Webster's).&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary, Dorset and Baber, Simon &amp; Schuster&lt;/ref&gt; The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] words ξένος (''xenos''), meaning "strange", "foreigner", and φόβος (''phobos''), meaning "fear".&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Standard English Dictionary' (OED). Oxford Press, 2004, CDROM version.&lt;/ref&gt;

A scholarly definition of xenophobia, according to Andreas Wimmer, is "an element of a political struggle about who has the right to be cared for by the state and society: a fight for the collective goods of the modern state." In other words, xenophobia arises when people feel that their rights to benefit from the government is being subverted by other people's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wimmer |first=Andreas |year=1997 |title=Explaining xenophobia and racism: A critical review of current research approaches |journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies |volume=20 |issue=1 |page=17 |doi=10.1080/01419870.1997.9993946 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
An early example of xenophobic sentiment in [[Western culture]] is the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] denigration of foreigners as "[[barbarian]]s", the belief that the Greek people and culture were superior to all others, and the subsequent conclusion that barbarians were naturally meant to be enslaved.&lt;ref name="GreeksBarbarians"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.ke/books?id=z3VmQB99c5YC |title=Greeks and Barbarians |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |author=Harrison, Thomas |year=2002 |page=3 |isbn=978-0-415-93959-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.medindia.net/patients/patientinfo/xenophobia-examples.htm |title=Xenophobia – Examples in World History |work=Medindia |access-date=2017-12-06 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]] also held notions of superiority over all other peoples, such as in a speech attributed to [[Manius Acilius Glabrio (consul 191 BC)|Manius Acilius]], "There, as you know, there were Macedonians and Thracians and Illyrians, all most warlike nations, here Syrians and Asiatic Greeks, the most worthless peoples among mankind and born for [[slavery]]."&lt;ref name="Invention Racism"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.ke/books?id=jfylyRawl8EC |title=The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity |publisher=Princeton University Press |author=Isaac, Benjamin H. |year=2006 |page=317 |isbn=978-0-691-12598-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muslim]] and [[Sikhism in Canada|Sikh Canadian]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s have faced [[racism]] and [[discrimination]] within recent years, especially after 2001, and the spill over effect of the United States’ [[War on Terror]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2011/09/11/911-muslim-women-discrimination_n_957305.html |title=9/11: Women In The Fight Against Discrimination |website=HuffPost |access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 survey from The Environics Institute, which was a follow-up to a study conducted 10 years prior that there may be discriminating attitudes that may be a residual of the effects of the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Environics Institute: Survey of Muslims in Canada |url=http://www.environicsinstitute.org/uploads/institute-projects/survey%20of%20muslims%20in%20canada%202016%20-%20final%20report.pdf |publisher=The Environics Institute |accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it comes to opinions on both Sikh's and Muslims, a poll done by [[Maclean's]] revealed that only 28% of Canadians view [[Islam]] favourably, and only 30% viewed the Sikh religion favourably. 45% of respondents believed Islam encourages violence.

When a Mexican of a darker-skinned tone marries one of a lighter skinned-tone, it is common for them say that they are " 'making the race better' (''mejorando la raza'')." This can be interpreted as a self-attack on their ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/article_2081.shtml Racism in Mexico?]", The Final Call, June 23, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Despite improving economic and social conditions of Indigenous Mexicans, discrimination against Indigenous Mexicans continues to this day and there are few laws to protect Indigenous Mexicans from discrimination.

When the [[Venezuelan War of Independence]] started, the Spanish enlisted the [[Llanero]]s, playing on their dislike of the ''[[Criollo (people)|criollos]]'' of the independence movement. José Tomás Boves led an army of llaneros which routinely killed white Venezuelans. After several more years of war, which killed half of [[Venezuela]]'s white population, the country achieved independence from Spain in 1821.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalpr.org/knowledge/businessguides/prlandscape-venezuela.pdf |title=globalpr.org |accessdate=17 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617124314/http://www.globalpr.org/knowledge/businessguides/prlandscape-venezuela.pdf |archivedate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/1491 |title=A First-Hand Impression of the Venezuelan Opposition |accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concern over Japanese ethnic and immigrant groups during the Second World War prompted the Canadian and U.S. governments to intern most of their ethnically Japanese populations in the western portions of North America. As in most countries, many people in the U.S. continue to be xenophobic against other races. In the view of a network of scores of US civil rights and human rights organizations, "Discrimination permeates all aspects of life in the United States, and extends to all communities of color." Discrimination against racial, ethnic, and religious minorities, especially when it comes to [[African Americans]], is widely acknowledged. Members of every major American ethnic and religious minority have perceived discrimination in their dealings with other minority racial and religious groups. Philosopher [[Cornel West]] has stated that "racism is an integral element within the very fabric of American culture and society. It is embedded in the country's first collective definition, enunciated in its subsequent laws, and imbued in its dominant way of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=West |first1=Cornel |title=Prophesy Deliverance!: An Afro-American Revolutionary Christianity |date=2002 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Donald Trump]] took presidential office in 2017, he repeatedly attempted to enact a [[Executive Order 13769|travel ban]] on originally seven countries ([[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], [[Yemen]], [[Syria]] and [[Libya]]) which were listed as "countries of concern" by [[Secretary of Homeland Security]] [[Jeh Johnson]] under the [[Obama administration]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=Department of Homeland Security |url=https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/02/18/dhs-announces-further-travel-restrictions-visa-waiver-program |date=February 18, 2016 |title=DHS Announces Further Travel Restrictions for the Visa Waiver Program |access-date=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/158/text |title=H.R.158 – Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 |year=2015 |publisher=Congress.gov |access-date=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later changed to six in a revision that removed Iraq in part due to criticism that the original order overlooked the country’s role in fighting [[Islamic terrorism]] and barred entry even to the Iraqi interpreters who had been embedded with US forces in the region.&lt;ref name="Siddiqui" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38798588 |title=US travel ban: Why these seven countries? |date=January 30, 2017 |publisher=BBC News |last1=Goodman |first1=Jack |accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Khizr and Ghazala Khan|Khizr Khan]], the father of [[United States Army]] Captain [[Humayun Khan (soldier)|Humayun Khan]], described it in a CNN interview as a continuation of what he called "Trump's xenophobic rhetoric"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trump's ban is disguise for xenophobia |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/29/opinions/trump-ban-xenophobia-disguise-amanullah/index.html |accessdate=6 September 2017 |date=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the order was described as xenophobic by [[Amnesty International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=xenophobic inhumane and just plain stupid |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/03/xenophobic-inhumane-and-just-plain-stupid/ |accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was also criticized for [[Islamophobia|targeting exclusively Muslim majority countries]].&lt;ref name="Siddiqui"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/06/new-trump-travel-ban-muslim-majority-countries-refugees |title=Trump travel ban: new order targeting six Muslim-majority countries signed |last=Siddiqui |first=Sabrina |date=2017-03-06 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2017-08-01 |last2=York |first2=Lauren Gambino Oliver Laughland in New |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of discriminatory laws against [[Chinese Indonesian#Post-independence and New Order Era|Chinese Indonesians]] were enacted by the government of [[Indonesia]]. In 1959, President [[Sukarno]] approved [[PP 10/1959]] that forced Chinese Indonesians to close their businesses in rural areas and relocate into urban areas. Moreover, political pressures in the 1970s and 1980s restricted the role of the Chinese Indonesian in politics, academics, and the military. As a result, they were thereafter constrained professionally to becoming entrepreneurs and professional managers in trade, manufacturing, and banking. In 1998, Indonesia riots over higher food prices and rumors of hoarding by merchants and shopkeepers often degenerated into anti-Chinese attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1998/02/24/qanda.t_2.php|title=Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia|website=www.iht.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(There are no laws within the Kingdom of Thailand which outlaws racial discrimination inclusive of racist cliches known in the Western world. Unlike its neighboring nations which have been under [[colonialism]], Thailand's heritage as an uncolonized state also shaped its existing laws unlike its Westernized counterparts after decolonization. This also includes signage promoting [[racial segregation]] as done in the United States prior to [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|1964]] and South Africa under [[Apartheid]].)

Although Thailand has incorporated certain Western ideals concerning beauty, Asian attitudes regarding skin tones have been around for a long time. The 20 million [[Isan]] population for instance, many of whom are of [[Lao people|Laotian]] and [[Khmer people|Khmer]] descent, traditionally had darker skin and studies show that many view themselves as less desirable than those with lighter skin. [[Skin whitening]] products have proven increasingly popular in most of Asia, including Thailand and are marketed in such a way as to promote light skin as beautiful and desirable.&lt;ref name="int-res"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.int-res.com/articles/esep2013/13/e013p027.pdf |date=6 August 2013 |title=Thailand: beauty and globalized self-identity through cosmetic therapy and skin lightening |author=Napat Chaipraditkul |journal=Ethics in Science and Environmental Politics |volume=13 |pages=27–37 |doi=10.3354/esep00134 |accessdate=2014-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Racism in Germany}}
The period after losing [[World War I]] led to an increased use of anti-Semitism and other racism in political discourse, for example among the right-wing [[Freikorps]], emotions that finally culminated in the ascent of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933. The [[Nazi racial policy]] and the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg Race Laws]] against Jews and other non-Aryans represented the most explicit racist policies in Europe in the twentieth century. These laws deprived all Jews including even half-Jews and quarter-Jews as well as other non-Aryans from German citizenship. Jews official title became "subject of the state". The Nuremberg Race Laws forbid racially mixed sexual relations and marriage between Aryans and at first Jews but was later extended to "Gypsies, Negroes or their bastard offspring".&lt;ref name="Burleigh1991"&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael Burleigh |title=The Racial State: Germany 1933–1945 |date=7 November 1991 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-39802-2 |page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such interracial relations became a criminal and punishable offence under the race laws known as "racial pollution" [[Rassenschande]].&lt;ref name="Burleigh1991" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=S.

As in other European countries, the [[Romani people]] faced disadvantages, including unequal treatment, discrimination, segregation and harassment. Negative stereotypes are often linked to Romani unemployment and reliance on state benefits.&lt;ref name="FRA"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2013-thematic-situation-report-3_en_1.pdf |title=Racism, discrimination, intolerance and extremism: learning from experiences in Greece and Hungary |publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) |date=December 2013 |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 and 2009 nine attacks took place against Romani in Hungary, resulting in six deaths and multiple injuries.

==== Italy ====
{{Main|Racism in Italy}}
[[Anti-Roma]] sentiment exists in [[Italy]] and takes the form of hostility, prejudice, discrimination or racism directed at Romani people. There's no reliable data for the total number of Roma people living in Italy, but estimates put it between 140,000 and 170,000. Many national and local political leaders engaged in rhetoric during 2007 and 2008 that maintained that the extraordinary rise in crime at the time was mainly a result of uncontrolled immigration of people of Roma origin from recent [[European Union]] member state Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hammarberg, "Memorandum following the visit to Italy on 19–20 June 2008," the [[Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights]], CommDH(2008)18, para. 26, 28 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; National and local leaders declared their plans to expel Roma from settlements in and around major cities and to deport illegal immigrants. The mayors of Rome and Milan signed "Security Pacts" in May 2007 that "envisaged the forced eviction of up to 10,000 Romani people."&lt;ref&gt;[[Amnesty International]], The State of the World’s Human Rights 2008: Italy, POL 10/001/2008, June 2008, pp. 171-172&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a May 2008 poll 68% of Italians, wanted to see all of the country's approximately 150,000 Gypsies, many of them Italian citizens, expelled.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/17/italy 68% of Italians want Roma expelled – poll], ''[[The Guardian]]'', Tom Kington, Rome, 17 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The survey, published as mobs in Naples burned down Gypsy camps that month, revealed that the majority also wanted all Gypsy camps in Italy to be demolished.&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;

==== Netherlands ====
{{Further|Antisemitism in the Netherlands}}
In the early 2012 the Dutch right-wing [[Party for Freedom]] established an [[Anti-Slavic sentiment|anti-Slavic]] (predominantly [[Anti-Polish sentiment|anti-Polish]]) and  [[Antiziganism|anti-Romani]] website, where native [[Dutch people]] could air their frustration about losing their job because of cheaper workers from [[Poland]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]] and other non-Germanic [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an countries. This led to commentaries involving [[hate speech]] and other racial prejudice mainly against Poles and Roma, but also aimed at other Central and Eastern European ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/news/115208 Dutch far right opens anti-Polish hotline: ''"Did you lose your job to a Pole, a Bulgarian, a Romanian, or any other Central or Eastern European? We would like to hear about it".'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Netherlands]], antisemitic incidents, from verbal abuse to violence, are reported, allegedly connected with Islamic youth, mostly boys from [[Morocco|Moroccan]] descent. A phrase made popular during football matches against the so-called Jewish football club [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] has been adopted by Muslim youth and is frequently heard at pro-Palestinian demonstrations: "Hamas, Hamas, Jews to the gas!" According to the Centre for Information and Documentation on Israel, a pro-Israel lobby group in the Netherlands, in 2009, the number of anti-Semitic incidents in [[Amsterdam]], the city that is home to most of the approximately 40,000 [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jews]], was said to be doubled compared to 2008.&lt;ref name="nrc.nl"&gt;Berkhout, Karel.

{{Further|Antisemitism in Norway}}
In 2010, the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] after one year of research, revealed that [[anti-semitism]] was common among Norwegian [[Muslim]]s. Teachers at schools with large shares of Muslims revealed that Muslim students often "praise or admire Adolf Hitler for his killing of Jews", that "Jew-hate is legitimate within vast groups of Muslim students," and "Muslims laugh or command [teachers] to stop when trying to educate about the [[Holocaust]]." Additionally that "while some students might protest when some express support for [[terrorism]], none object when students express hate of Jews" and that it says in "the Quran that you shall kill Jews, all true Muslims hate Jews." Most of these students were said to be born and raised in Norway. One [[Jew]]ish father also told that his child after school had been taken by a Muslim mob (though managed to escape), reportedly "to be taken out to the forest and hanged because he was a Jew".&lt;ref name="Jødiske barn blir hetset 2010"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=NRK |title=Nett-TV: Lørdagsrevyen 13.03.10 Jødiske barn blir hetset |date=March 13, 2010 |url=https://www.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317183545/https://www.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057/ |archive-date=March 17, 2010 |dead-url=yes |language=no |access-date=June 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the beginning of the 20th century, most European Jews lived in the so-called [[Pale of Settlement]], the Western frontier of the [[Russian Empire]] consisting generally of the modern-day countries of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus and neighboring regions.  Many pogroms accompanied the [[Russian Revolution|Revolution of 1917]] and the ensuing [[Russian Civil War]], an estimated 70,000 to 250,000 civilian Jews were killed in the atrocities throughout the former [[Russian Empire]]; the number of Jewish orphans exceeded 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-215022/anti-Semitism |title=anti-Semitism |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hilary L Rubinstein, Daniel C Cohn-Sherbok, Abraham J Edelheit, William D Rubinstein, ''The Jews in the Modern World'', Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, Fredrik Sieradzk told ''Die Presse'', an Austrian Internet publication, that Jews are being "harassed and physically attacked" by "people from the Middle East", although he added that only a small number of Malmö's 40,000 Muslims "exhibit hatred of Jews". Sieradzk also stated that approximately 30 Jewish families have emigrated from Malmö to Israel in the past year, specifically to escape from harassment.

In addition to the many victims among the various tribes of the northern and southern regions of the country that have perished in the ongoing conflict, [[White people|white]] foreigners residing or visiting Ivory Coast have also been subjected to violent attacks. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, the Ivory Coast government is guilty of fanning ethnic hatred for its own political ends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/Africa/1932930.stm Ivory Coast "fanning ethnic hatred"] BBC News. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529154708/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1932930.stm |date=2006-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slavery in Mauritania]] persists despite its abolition in 1980 and mostly affects the descendants of black Africans abducted into [[slavery]] who now live in [[Mauritania]] as "black [[Moors]]" or ''[[haratin]]'' and who partially still serve the "white Moors", or ''bidhan'', as slaves. The practice of slavery in Mauritania is most dominant within the traditional upper class of the Moors. For centuries, the ''haratin'' lower class, mostly poor black Africans living in rural areas, have been considered natural slaves by these Moors. Social attitudes have changed among most urban Moors, but in rural areas, the ancient divide remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L18334379.htm |title=Thomson Reuters Foundation |publisher=Thomson Reuters Foundation |accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Immigration Restriction Act 1901]] ([[White Australia policy]]) effectively barred people of non-European descent from [[Immigration to Australia|immigrating to Australia]]. There was never any specific policy titled as such, but the term was invented later to encapsulate a collection of policies that were designed to exclude people from [[Asia]] (particularly [[China]]) and the [[Pacific Islands]] (particularly [[Melanesia]]) from immigrating to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Wendy Lewis]], Simon Balderstone and John Bowan |title=Events That Shaped Australia |page=102 |publisher=New Holland |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-74110-492-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Menzies Government (1949–1966)|Menzies]] and [[Holt Government]]s effectively dismantled the policies between 1949 and 1966 and the [[Whitlam Government]] passed laws to ensure that [[Race (human classification)|race]] would be totally disregarded as a component for immigration to Australia in 1973.&lt;ref name="immi.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.border.gov.au/about/corporate/information/fact-sheets/08abolition |title=Fact Sheet – Abolition of the 'White Australia' Policy |work=Australian Immigration |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia, National Communications Branch, Department of Immigration and Citizenship |accessdate=27 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919131355/http://www.border.gov.au/about/corporate/information/fact-sheets/08abolition# |archive-date=2015-09-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2005 Cronulla riots]] were a series of [[race riots]] and outbreaks of [[mob violence]] in [[Sydney]]'s southern suburb [[Cronulla]] which resulted from strained relations between [[Anglo-Celtic Australian|Anglo-Celtic]] and (predominantly [[Muslim]]) [[Lebanese Australians]]. [[Travel warning]]s for Australia were issued by some countries but were later removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Gender, Race and National Identity: Nations of Flesh and Blood |last=Hogan |first=Jackie |publisher=Routledge |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-134-17406-5 |location= |pages=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 2005, a fight broke out between a group of [[Surf Life Saving Club|volunteer surf lifesavers]] and Lebanese youth.

On 30 May 2009, Indian students protested against what they claimed were racist attacks, blocking streets in central [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]]. Thousands of students gathered outside the [[Royal Melbourne Hospital]] where one of the victims was admitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/indians-abroad/18-Indians-detained-for-breaching-Australia-peace-rally/articleshow/4602328.cms |title=18 Indians detained for breaching Australia peace rally |work=The Times of India |date=June 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of this event, the Australian Government started a [[Helpline]] for Indian students to report such incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Topsfield |first=Jewel |title=Helpline thrown to Indian students |website=The Age |date=May 11, 2009 |url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/helpline-thrown-to-indian-students-20090511-b0mt.html |access-date=June 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]] High Commissioner for Human Rights, [[Navi Pillay]], termed these attacks "disturbing" and called for Australia to investigate the matters further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report_un-asks-australia-to-investigate-root-cause-of-attacks-on-indian_1355539 |title=UN asks Australia to investigate 'root cause' of attacks on Indian |work=dna |accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
