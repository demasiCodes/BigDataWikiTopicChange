A 1997 review article on xenophobia holds that it is "an element of a political struggle about who has the right to be cared for by the state and society: a fight for the collective good of the modern state."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wimmer|first=Andreas|year=1997|title=Explaining xenophobia and racism: A critical review of current research approaches|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=20|issue=1|page=17|doi=10.1080/01419870.1997.9993946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Italian sociologist Guido Bolaffi, xenophobia can also be exhibited as an "uncritical exaltation of another culture" which is ascribed "an unreal, stereotyped and exotic quality".&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

An early example of xenophobic sentiment in [[Western culture]] is the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] denigration of foreigners as "[[barbarian]]s", the belief that the [[Greeks|Greek people]] and [[Culture of Greece|culture]] were superior to all others, and the subsequent conclusion that barbarians were naturally meant to be enslaved.&lt;ref name="GreeksBarbarians"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z3VmQB99c5YC |title=Greeks and Barbarians |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |author=Harrison, Thomas |year=2002 |page=3 |isbn=978-0-415-93959-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.medindia.net/patients/patientinfo/xenophobia-examples.htm |title=Xenophobia – Examples in World History |work=Medindia |access-date=2017-12-06 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]] also held notions of superiority over other peoples.&lt;ref name="Invention Racism"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfylyRawl8EC |title=The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity |publisher=Princeton University Press |author=Isaac, Benjamin H. |year=2006 |page=317 |isbn=978-0-691-12598-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 March 1911 a band of Maderista soldiers entered Torreón, Mexico, and massacred 303 Chinese and five Japanese.

The Chinese were easy to identify in northern cities and were frequent targets especially in Sonora in the 1930s. Systematic persecution resulted from economic, political, and psychological fears of the Chinese, and the government showed little interest in protecting them.&lt;ref&gt;Charles C.

Theresa Alfaro-Velcamp argues that the Porfiriato, 1876-1910 promoted immigration from the Middle East. However the revolution of 1910-20 saw a surge in xenophobia and nationalism based on "mestizaje."

Peter Szok argues that when the United States brought in large numbers of laborers from the Caribbean--called "[[Afro-Panamanians]]"-- to build the [[Panama Canal]] (1905-1914), xenophobia emerged. The local elite in Panama felt its culture was threatened: they cried out, "La Patria es el Recuerdo." ("The Homeland is the Memory") and developed a Hispanophile elitist identity through an artistic literary movement known as "Hispanismo." Another result was the election of the "overtly nationalist and anti-imperialist" [[Arnulfo Arias]] as president in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Szok,  "'La Patria es el Recuerdo', Hispanophile Nationalism in Early Twentieth-Century Panama, 1903-1941."

Members of every major American ethnic and religious minority group have perceived discrimination in their dealings with members of other minority racial and religious groups. Philosopher [[Cornel West]] has stated that "racism is an integral element within the very fabric of American culture and society.

=====Sinophobia=====
{{Main|Anti-Chinese sentiment}}
In the early 20th century, fear of China--"[[Anti-Chinese sentiment|Sinophobia]]" -- was a widespread form of xenophobia, especially in the [[Mass media|popular media]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Frayling, ''[[The Yellow Peril: Dr. Fu Manchu and the Rise of Chinaphobia]]'' (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; 

 China scholar [[Julia Lovell]] argues:&lt;blockquote&gt; Britain buzzed with sinophobia. Respectable middle-class magazines, tabloids and comics alike spread stories of ruthless Chinese ambitions to destroy the west. The Chinese master-criminal (with his “crafty yellow face twisted by a thin-lipped grin”, dreaming of world domination) had become a staple of children’s publications. In 1911, “The Chinese in England: A Growing National Problem” (an article distributed around the Home Office) warned of “a vast and convulsive Armageddon to determine who is to be the master of the world, the white or yellow man”. After the first world war, cinemas, theatres, novels and newspapers broadcast visions of the “Yellow Peril” machinating to corrupt white society.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Lovell, "The Yellow Peril: Dr. Fu Manchu and the Rise of Chinaphobia by
Christopher Frayling" [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/30/yellow-peril-dr-fu-manchu-rise-of-chinaphobia-christopher-frayling-review ''The Guardian'' 30 October 2014]  &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====The Boxers=====
{{Main|Boxer Rebellion}}
The [[Boxer Rebellion]] was a violent anti-foreign,  [[Persecution of Christians#China|anti-Christian]], and [[anti-imperialist]] uprising in China between 1899 and 1901. It was led by a new group the "Militia United in Righteousness' known as ''[[Boxers (group)|Boxers]]'' because many of their members had practised [[Chinese martial arts]], referred to at the time as Chinese Boxing.  After China's defeat in war by Japan in 1895, villagers in North China feared the expansion of [[Spheres of influence#China|foreign spheres of influence]] and resented the extension of privileges to Christian missionaries. In a severe drought, Boxer violence spread across [[Shandong]] and the [[North China Plain]], destroying foreign property, attacking or murdering Christian missionaries and [[Christianity in China|Chinese Christians]]. In June 1900, Boxer fighters, convinced they were invulnerable to foreign weapons, converged on Beijing with the slogan "Support the Qing government and exterminate the foreigners." Diplomats, missionaries, soldiers and some Chinese Christians took refuge in the diplomatic [[Beijing Legation Quarter|Legation Quarter]]. They were besieged for 55 days by the Imperial Army of the Chinese government and the Boxers. George Makari says the Boxers, "promoted a violent hatred of all those from other lands and made no effort to distinguish the beneficient from the rapacious ones.... They were unabashedly xenophobic."&lt;ref&gt; George Makari, ''Of Fear and Strangers: A History of Xenophobia'' (2021), pp 70-71. &lt;/ref&gt; The Boxers were overthrown by an  [[Eight Nation Alliance]] of American, Austro-Hungarian, British, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Russian troops--20,000 in all--that invaded China to lift the siege in August 1900.  The allies imposed the [[Boxer Protocol]] in 1901, with a massive annual cash indemnity to be paid by the Chinese government. The episode generated worldwide attention and denunciation of xenophobia.&lt;ref&gt;Makari, ''Of Fear and Strangers: A History of Xenophobia'' (2021), ch 4, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Cohen, '' History in Three Keys: The Boxers as Event, Experience, and Myth'' (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Both Nationalists and Communists =====
Historian [[Mary C. Wright]] has argued that the combination of xenophobia and nationalism had a major impact on the Chinese worldview in the first half of the 20th century. Examining the bitterness and hatred which existed toward Americans and Europeans in the decades before the Communist takeover in 1949, she argues:&lt;blockquote&gt;The crude fear of the white peril that the [[Qing dynasty|last imperial dynasty]] had been able to exploit in the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 had been submerged but not overcome, and expanding special privileges of foreigners were irritants in increasingly wide spheres of Chinese life. These fears and irritations provided a mass sounding board for what otherwise might have been rather arid denunciations of imperialists. It is well to remember that both Nationalists and Communists have struck this note.&lt;ref&gt;Mary C.  Wright, "Modern China in Transition, 1900-1950." ‘’The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science’’ 321.1 (1959): 1-8, at p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In further support see Donald Gillin, "China and the Foreigner, 1911 to 1950."

==== Indonesia ====
{{Main|Chinese Indonesians}}

A number of discriminatory laws against [[Chinese Indonesian#Post-independence and New Order Era|Chinese Indonesians]] were enacted by the government of [[Indonesia]]. In 1959, President [[Sukarno]] approved [[PP 10/1959]] that forced Chinese Indonesians to close their businesses in rural areas and relocate into urban areas. Moreover, political pressures in the 1970s and 1980s restricted the role of the Chinese Indonesian in politics, academics, and the military. As a result, they were thereafter constrained professionally to becoming entrepreneurs and professional managers in trade, manufacturing, and banking. In 1998, Indonesia riots over higher [[food prices]] and rumors of hoarding by merchants and shopkeepers often degenerated into anti-Chinese attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1998/02/24/qanda.t_2.php|title=Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia|website=www.iht.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gijs Kruijtzer  argues that the roots of modern communalism (the antagonism between “communities” of Hindus and Muslims) first appeared in the 1677-1687 period when the Maratha king [[Shivaji]] introduced the factional strife between the Dedccanis and the Afghans. It has festered ever since, and in the 21st century became a defining characteristic of the government of India.&lt;ref&gt;Gijs Kruijtzer, ''Xenophobia in Seventeenth-Century India'' (Leiden University Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The racial tension between the dominant poor [[Malaysian Malay|Malay Muslims]] and the minority wealthier Chinese has long characterized Malaysia. It was a major factor in the [[History of Singapore|separation of Singapore in 1965]] to become an independent, primarily Chinese nation.  Amy L. Freedman points to the electoral system, the centrality of ethnic parties, gerrymandering, and systematic discrimination against the Chinese in education and jobs as critical factors in xenophobia. Recently the goal of creating a more inclusive national identity has been emphasized.&lt;ref&gt;Amy L. Freedman, "The effect of government policy and institutions on Chinese overseas acculturation: The case of Malaysia." ''Modern Asian Studies'' 35.2 (2001): 411-440. &lt;/ref&gt;

The period after Germany's loss of [[World War I]] led to the increased espousal of [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] and other forms of [[racism]] in the country's political discourse, for example, emotions which were initially expressed by members of the right-wing [[Freikorps]] finally culminated in the ascent of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933. The [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi Party's racial policy]] and the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg Race Laws]] against [[Jews]] and other non-[[Aryan race|Aryans]] represented the most explicit racist policies in twentieth century Europe. These laws deprived all Jews (including half-Jews and quarter-Jews) and all other non-Aryans of German citizenship. The official title of Jews became "subjects of the state". At first, the Nuremberg Race Laws only forbade racially mixed sexual relationships and marriages between Aryans and Jews but later they were extended to "[[Romani people|Gypsies]], [[Black people|Negroes]] or their bastard offspring".&lt;ref name="Burleigh1991"&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Burleigh |title=The Racial State: Germany 1933–1945 |date=7 November 1991 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-39802-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/racialstate00mich/page/49 49] |url=https://archive.org/details/racialstate00mich/page/49 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such interracial relationships were known as "racial pollution" [[Rassenschande]], and they became a criminal and punishable offence under the race laws.&lt;ref name="Burleigh1991" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=S.

As in other European countries, the [[Romani people]] faced disadvantages, including unequal treatment, discrimination, segregation and harassment. Negative stereotypes are often linked to Romani unemployment and reliance on state benefits.&lt;ref name="FRA"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2013-thematic-situation-report-3_en_1.pdf |title=Racism, discrimination, intolerance and extremism: learning from experiences in Greece and Hungary |publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) |date=December 2013 |access-date=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 and 2009 nine attacks took place against Romani in Hungary, resulting in six deaths and multiple injuries. According to the Hungarian curia (supreme court), these murders were motivated by [[Antiziganism|anti-Romani sentiment]] and sentenced the perpetrators to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name="FRA" /&gt;

==== Italy ====
{{Main|Racism in Italy}}

A new party emerged in the 1980s, [[Lega Nord]]. According to Gilda Zazzara, it started with identity-based claims and secessionist proposals for the North to break away from Southern Italy. It shifted to xenophobia and the demand that job priority be accorded to native Italian workers.&lt;ref&gt;Gilda Zazzara, " 'Italians First': Workers on the Right Amidst Old and New Populisms" ''International Labor &amp; Working-Class History'' (2018) Vol. 93, p101-112. &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti-Roma]] sentiment in Italy takes the form of hostility, prejudice, discrimination or racism directed at Romani people. There's no reliable data for the total number of Roma people living in Italy, but estimates put it between 140,000 and 170,000. Many national and local political leaders engaged in rhetoric during 2007 and 2008 that maintained that the extraordinary rise in crime at the time was mainly a result of uncontrolled immigration of people of Roma origin from recent [[European Union]] member state Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hammarberg, "Memorandum following the visit to Italy on 19–20 June 2008," the [[Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights]], CommDH(2008)18, para. 26, 28 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; National and local leaders declared their plans to expel Roma from settlements in and around major cities and to deport illegal immigrants. The mayors of Rome and Milan signed "Security Pacts" in May 2007 that "envisaged the forced eviction of up to 10,000 Romani people."&lt;ref&gt;[[Amnesty International]], The State of the World’s Human Rights 2008: Italy, POL 10/001/2008, June 2008, pp. 171-172&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a May 2008 poll 68% of Italians, wanted to see all of the country's approximately 150,000 Gypsies, many of them Italian citizens, expelled.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/17/italy 68% of Italians want Roma expelled – poll], ''[[The Guardian]]'', Tom Kington, Rome, 17 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The survey, published as mobs in Naples burned down Gypsy camps that month, revealed that the majority also wanted all Gypsy camps in Italy to be demolished.&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;

==== Netherlands ====
{{Further|Antisemitism in the Netherlands}}
In early 2012 the Dutch right-wing [[Party for Freedom]] established an [[Anti-Slavic sentiment|anti-Slavic]] (predominantly [[Anti-Polish sentiment|anti-Polish]]) and [[Antiziganism|anti-Romani]] website, where native [[Dutch people]] could air their frustration about losing their job because of cheaper workers from [[Poland]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]] and other non-Germanic [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an countries. This led to commentaries involving [[hate speech]] and other racial prejudice mainly against Poles and Roma, but also aimed at other Central and Eastern European ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euobserver.com/news/115208|title=Dutch far right opens anti-Polish hotline|website=EUobserver}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2015 report by the [[OECD]] and [[European Commission|EU Commission]], 37% of young people born in the country with immigrant parents say they had experienced discrimination in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/06/23/racism-denmark-an-exchange/|title=Racism in the North: An Exchange|last1=Eakin|first1=Hugh|date=2016-06-23|access-date=2019-12-14|last2=Rose|first2=Flemming|language=en|issn=0028-7504|last3=Mchangama|first3=Jacob|journal=New York Review of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Netherlands]], antisemitic incidents, from verbal abuse to violence, are reported, allegedly connected with Islamic youth, mostly boys of [[Morocco|Moroccan]] descent. A phrase made popular during football matches against the so-called Jewish football club [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] has been adopted by Muslim youth and is frequently heard at pro-Palestinian demonstrations: "Hamas, Hamas, Jews to the gas!" According to the Centre for Information and Documentation on Israel, a pro-Israel lobby group in the Netherlands, in 2009, the number of anti-Semitic incidents in [[Amsterdam]], the city that is home to most of the approximately 40,000 [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jews]], doubled compared to 2008.&lt;ref name="nrc.nl"&gt;Berkhout, Karel.

==== Norway ====
{{Further|Antisemitism in Norway}}
In 2010, the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] after one year of research, revealed that [[antisemitism]] was common among Norwegian [[Muslim]]s. Teachers at schools with large shares of Muslims revealed that Muslim students often "praise or admire Adolf Hitler for his killing of Jews", that "Jew-hate is legitimate within vast groups of Muslim students," and "Muslims laugh or command [teachers] to stop when trying to educate about the [[Holocaust]]." Additionally that "while some students might protest when some express support for [[terrorism]], none object when students express hate of Jews" and that it says in "the Quran that you shall kill Jews, all true Muslims hate Jews." Most of these students were said to be born and raised in Norway. One [[Jew]]ish father also told that his child after school had been taken by a Muslim mob (though managed to escape), reportedly "to be taken out to the forest and hanged because he was a Jew".&lt;ref name="Jødiske barn blir hetset 2010"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=NRK |title=Nett-TV: Lørdagsrevyen 13.03.10 Jødiske barn blir hetset |date=March 13, 2010 |url=https://www.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317183545/https://www.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057/ |archive-date=March 17, 2010 |url-status=dead |language=no |access-date=June 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, especially after nationalistic uprisings in Poland in the 1860s, the government displayed xenophobia in its hostility toward ethnic minorities that did not speak Russian. The decision was to reduce the use of other languages, and insist on Russification.&lt;ref&gt;A. V.

By the beginning of the 20th century, most European Jews lived in the so-called [[Pale of Settlement]], the Western frontier of the [[Russian Empire]] consisting generally of the modern-day countries of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus and neighboring regions.  Many pogroms accompanied the [[Russian Revolution|Revolution of 1917]] and the ensuing [[Russian Civil War]], an estimated 70,000 to 250,000 civilian Jews were killed in the atrocities throughout the former [[Russian Empire]]; the number of Jewish orphans exceeded 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-215022/anti-Semitism |title=anti-Semitism |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilary L.

After World War II official national policy was to bring in students from Communist countries in East Europe and Asia for advanced training in Communist leadership roles .

Sieradzk also stated that approximately 30 Jewish families have emigrated from Malmö to Israel in the past year, specifically to escape from harassment.

The extent and the targets of racist attitudes in the United Kingdom have varied over time. It has resulted in cases of discrimination, riots and [[Hate crime#United Kingdom|racially motivated murder]]s.

==== Mauritania ====
{{Main|Slavery in Mauritania}}

[[Slavery in Mauritania]] persists despite its abolition in 1980 and mostly affects the descendants of black Africans abducted into [[slavery]] who now live in [[Mauritania]] as "black [[Moors]]" or ''[[haratin]]'' and who partially still serve the "white Moors", or ''bidhan'', as slaves. The practice of slavery in Mauritania is most dominant within the traditional upper class of the Moors. For centuries, the ''haratin'' lower class, mostly poor black Africans living in rural areas, have been considered natural slaves by these Moors. Social attitudes have changed among most urban Moors, but in rural areas, the ancient divide remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L18334379.htm |title=Thomson Reuters Foundation |publisher=Thomson Reuters Foundation |access-date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:People's March Anti Xenophobia.jpg|thumb|March against [[xenophobia in South Africa]], Johannesburg, 23 April 2015]]
Xenophobia in [[South Africa]] has been present in both the [[apartheid]] and [[History of South Africa (1994–present)|post–apartheid]] eras. Hostility between the [[British people|British]] and [[Boer]]s exacerbated by the [[Second Boer War]] led to rebellion by poor Afrikaners who looted British-owned shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=blgjhkGD0vgC |title=The Afrikaners: Biography of a People |publisher=C.

This effectively halted Indian immigration. The Township Franchise Ordinance of 1924 was intended to "deprive Indians of municipal franchise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/politics-and-society/anti-indian-legislation-1800s-1959 |title=Anti-Indian Legislation 1800s – 1959 |work=South African History Online |access-date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophobic attitudes toward the Chinese have also been present, sometimes in the form of robberies or hijackings,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/africa/940619/chinese-traders-changed-south-africa-now-theyre-leaving/|title=Chinese migrants have changed the face of South Africa.
