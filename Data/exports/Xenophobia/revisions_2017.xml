'''Xenophobia''' is the fear and distrust of that which is perceived to be foreign or strange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/xenophobia?q=xenophobia|title=Xenophobia - definition of xenophobia in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/xenophobia|title=Xenophobia - Define Xenophobia at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophobia can manifest itself in many ways involving the relations and [[perception]]s of an [[ingroup]] towards an [[Outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]], including a fear of losing identity, suspicion of its activities, aggression, and desire to eliminate its presence to secure a presumed purity.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Guido Bolaffi. ''Dictionary of race, ethnicity and culture''. SAGE Publications Ltd., 2003. Pp. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophobia can also be exhibited in the form of an "uncritical exaltation of another culture" in which a culture is ascribed "an unreal, stereotyped and exotic quality".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The terms xenophobia and [[racism]] are sometimes confused and used interchangeably because people who share a national origin may also belong to the same [[race (human classification)|race]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO - Xenophobia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/international-migration/glossary/xenophobia/ | title=Xenophobia | publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization | accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, xenophobia is usually distinguished by opposition to foreign culture.&lt;ref name="UNESCO - Xenophobia" /&gt; Xenophobia is a political term and not a recognized medical [[phobia]].

==Definitions==
Dictionary definitions of ''xenophobia'' include: "deep-rooted fear towards foreigners" (Oxford English Dictionary; OED), and "fear of the unfamiliar" (Webster's).&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary, Dorset and Baber, Simon &amp; Schuster&lt;/ref&gt; The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] words ξένος (''xenos''), meaning "strange", "foreigner", and φόβος (''phobos''), meaning "fear".&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Standard English Dictionary' (OED). Oxford Press, 2004, CDROM version.&lt;/ref&gt;

A scholarly definition of xenophobia, according to Andreas Wimmer, is "an element of a political struggle about who has the right to be cared for by the state and society: a fight for the collective goods of the modern state". In other words, xenophobia arises when people feel that their rights to benefit from the government is being subverted by other people's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wimmer|first=Andreas|year=1997|title=Explaining xenophobia and racism: A critical review of current research approaches|url=http://www.tandfonline.com.jproxy.nuim.ie/doi/abs/10.1080/01419870.1997.9993946|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=20 |issue=1|pages=17|via=|doi=10.1080/01419870.1997.9993946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
An early example of xenophobic sentiment in [[Western culture]] is the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] denigration of foreigners as "[[barbarian]]s", the belief that the Greek people and culture were superior to all others, and the subsequent conclusion that barbarians were naturally meant to be enslaved.&lt;ref name="GreeksBarbarians"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.ke/books?id=z3VmQB99c5YC | title=Greeks and Barbarians | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | author=Harrison, Thomas | year=2002 | pages=3 | isbn=9780415939591}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]] also held notions of superiority over all other peoples, such as in a speech attributed to [[Manius Acilius Glabrio (consul 191 BC)|Manius Acilius]], "There, as you know, there were Macedonians and Thracians and Illyrians, all most warlike nations, here Syrians and Asiatic Greeks, the most worthless peoples among mankind and born for [[slavery]]."&lt;ref name="Invention Racism"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.ke/books?id=jfylyRawl8EC | title=The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity | publisher=Princeton University Press | author=Isaac, Benjamin H. | year=2006 | pages=317 | isbn=9780691125985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trump signing order January 27.jpg|thumb|U.S. President Donald Trump signing the original travel ban (Executive Order 13769)]]
==== United States of America ==== 
Concern over Japanese ethnic and immigrant groups during the Second World War prompted the Canadian and U.S. governments to intern most of their ethnically Japanese populations in the western portions of North America. 

After [[Donald Trump]] took presidential office in 2017, he repeatedly attempted to enact a [[Executive Order 13769|travel ban]] on originally seven countries, later changed to six. The seven original countries were [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], [[Yemen]], [[Syria]] and [[Libya]] although later Iraq was removed from the list after criticism that the original order overlooked the country’s role in fighting [[Islamic terrorism]] and barred entry even to the Iraqi interpreters who had been embedded with US forces in the region. The policy was criticized for targeting exclusively Muslim majority countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/06/new-trump-travel-ban-muslim-majority-countries-refugees|title=Trump travel ban: new order targeting six Muslim-majority countries signed|last=Siddiqui|first=Sabrina|date=2017-03-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-01|last2=York|first2=Lauren Gambino Oliver Laughland in New|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order was described as xenophobic by Amnesty International&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=xenophobic inhumane and just plain stupid|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/03/xenophobic-inhumane-and-just-plain-stupid/|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Khizr and Ghazala Khan|Khizr Khan]], the father of [[United States Army]] Captain [[Humayun Khan (soldier)|Humayun Khan]], described it in a CNN interview as a continuation of what he called "Trump's xenophobic rhetoric." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump's ban is disguise for xenophobia|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/29/opinions/trump-ban-xenophobia-disguise-amanullah/index.html|accessdate=6 September 2017|date=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the state of [[Penang]] held a referendum that bans foreigners from cooking local cuisines. A well-known local chef, [[Redzuawan Ismail]], criticised this law.&lt;ref&gt;http://ifonlysingaporeans.blogspot.my/2014/10/penang-bans-foreign-cooks-at-hawker.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Xenophobia in [[South Africa]] has been present in both the [[apartheid]] and [[History of South Africa (1994–present)|post–apartheid]] eras. Hostility between the [[British people|British]] and [[Boer]]s exacerbated by the [[Second Boer War]] led to rebellion by poor Afrikaners who looted British-owned shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.ke/books?id=blgjhkGD0vgC | title=The Afrikaners: Biography of a People | publisher=C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers | author=Giliomee, Hermann | year=2003 | pages=383 | isbn=9781850657149}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa also passed numerous acts intended to keep out Indians, such as the Immigrants Regulation Act of 1913, which provided for the exclusion of "undesirables", a group of people that included Indians. This effectively halted Indian immigration. The Township Franchise Ordinance of 1924 was intended to "deprive Indians of municipal franchise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/politics-and-society/anti-indian-legislation-1800s-1959 | title=Anti-Indian Legislation 1800s - 1959 | work=South African History Online | accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 and 1995, gangs of armed youth destroyed the homes of foreign nationals living in [[Johannesburg]], demanding that the police work to repatriate them to their home countries.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/xenophobic-violence-democratic-south-africa | title=Xenophobic violence in democratic South Africa | work=South Africa History Online | accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, a widely documented spate of xenophobic attacks occurred in Johannesburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/20/world/africa/20safrica.html?_r=0 | title=South Afrians Take Out Rage on Immigrants | work=The New York Times | date=20 May 2008 | accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/20/zimbabwe.southafrica | title=Thousands seek sanctuary as South Africans turn on refugees | work=The Guardian | date=20 May 2008 | accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7407914.stm | title=Thousands flee S Africa attacks | work=BBC NEWS | date=19 May 2008 | accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that tens of thousands of migrants were displaced; property, businesses and homes were widely looted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2013-05-28-analysis-the-ugly-truth-behind-sas-xenophobic-violence/ | title=Analysis: The ugly truth behind SA’s xenophobic violence | work=Daily Maverick | date=28 May 2013 | accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death toll after the attack stood at 56.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In 2015, another widely documented series of xenophobic attacks occurred in South Africa, mostly against migrant [[Zimbabwe]]ans.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.chronicle.co.zw/xenophobia-death-toll-climbs-to-7/ | title=Xenophobia death toll climbs to 7 | work=The Chronicle | date=20 April 2015 | accessdate=30 June 2016 | author=Kazunga, Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed remarks by [[Zulu people|Zulu]] King [[Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu]] stating that the migrants should "pack their bags and leave".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/04/deaths-south-africa-mobs-target-foreigners-150415063058933.html | title=Deaths in South Africa as mobs target foreigners | work=Al Jazeera | date=15 April 2015 | accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 20 April 2015, 7 people had died and more than 2000 foreigners had been displaced.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
