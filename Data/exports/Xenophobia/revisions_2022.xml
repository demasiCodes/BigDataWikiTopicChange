A 1997 review article on xenophobia holds that it is "an element of a political struggle about who has the right to be cared for by the state and society: a fight for the collective good of the modern state."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wimmer|first=Andreas|year=1997|title=Explaining xenophobia and racism: A critical review of current research approaches|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=20|issue=1|page=17|doi=10.1080/01419870.1997.9993946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Italian sociologist Guido Bolaffi, xenophobia can also be exhibited as an "''uncritical exaltation of another culture''" which is ascribed "''an unreal, stereotyped and exotic quality''".&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

An early example of xenophobic sentiment in [[Western culture]] is the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] denigration of foreigners as "[[barbarian]]s", the belief that the [[Greeks|Greek people]] and [[Culture of Greece|culture]] were superior to all other peoples and [[culture]]s, and the subsequent conclusion that barbarians were naturally meant to be [[Slavery|enslaved]].&lt;ref name="GreeksBarbarians"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z3VmQB99c5YC |title=Greeks and Barbarians |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |author=Harrison, Thomas |year=2002 |page=3 |isbn=978-0-415-93959-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.medindia.net/patients/patientinfo/xenophobia-examples.htm |title=Xenophobia – Examples in World History |work=Medindia |access-date=6 December 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black Africans were considered especially exotic, and perhaps they were considered threateningly alien, so they are seldom if ever mentioned in Roman literature without some negative connotations. The historian [[Appian]] claims that the military commander [[Marcus Junius Brutus]], before the [[battle of Philippi]] in 42BC, met an 'Ethiopian' outside the gates of his camp: his soldiers instantly hacked the man to pieces, taking his appearance for a bad omen—to the superstitious Roman, black was the colour of death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=of Alexandria |first1=Appian |title=The Civil Wars |page=4.17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 March 1911 a band of [[List of factions in the Mexican Revolution|Maderista]] soldiers entered [[Torreón|Torreón, Mexico]], and [[Torreón massacre|massacred 303 Chinese and five Japanese]]. Historian Larissa Schwartz argues that [[Kang Youwei]] had successfully organized the prosperous Chinese businessmen there, making them a visible target for class antagonism made extreme by xenophobia.&lt;ref&gt;Larissa N.

The Chinese were easy to identify in northern cities and were frequent targets especially in Sonora in the 1930s. Systematic persecution resulted from economic, political, and psychological fears of the Chinese, and the government showed little interest in protecting them.&lt;ref&gt;Charles C.

Theresa Alfaro-Velcamp argues that the Porfiriato, 1876–1910 promoted immigration from the Middle East. However the revolution of 1910–20 saw a surge in xenophobia and nationalism based on "mestizaje." The community divided into the economically prosperous [[Lebanese Mexicans]] who took pride in a distinct Lebanese-Mexican identity, while the downscale remainder often merged into the mestizo community.&lt;ref&gt;Theresa Alfaro-Velcamp, .

Peter Szok argues that when the United States brought in large numbers of laborers from the Caribbean—called "[[Afro-Panamanians]]"—to build the [[Panama Canal]] (1905–1914), xenophobia emerged. The local elite in Panama felt its culture was threatened: they cried out, "La Patria es el Recuerdo." ("The Homeland is the Memory") and developed a Hispanophile elitist identity through an artistic literary movement known as "Hispanismo." Another result was the election of the "overtly nationalist and anti-imperialist" [[Arnulfo Arias]] as president in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Szok,  "'La Patria es el Recuerdo', Hispanophile Nationalism in Early Twentieth-Century Panama, 1903–1941."

Members of every major American ethnic and religious minority group have perceived discrimination in their dealings with members of other minority racial and religious groups.

=====The Boxers=====
{{Main|Boxer Rebellion}}
The [[Boxer Rebellion]] was a violent anti-foreign, [[Persecution of Christians#China|anti-Christian]], and [[anti-imperialist]] uprising which occurred in China between 1899 and 1901. It was led by a new group, the "Militia United in Righteousness', the group was popularly known as the ''[[Boxers (group)|Boxers]]'' because many of its members had practiced [[Chinese martial arts]], at the time, these martial arts were popularly referred to as Chinese Boxing.  After China's defeat in war by Japan in 1895, villagers in North China feared the expansion of [[Spheres of influence#China|foreign spheres of influence]] and resented the extension of privileges to Christian missionaries. In a severe drought, Boxer violence spread across [[Shandong]] and the [[North China Plain]], destroying foreign property, attacking or murdering Christian missionaries and [[Christianity in China|Chinese Christians]]. In June 1900, Boxer fighters, convinced that they were invulnerable to foreign weapons, converged on [[Beijing]], and their slogan was "Support the Qing government and exterminate the foreigners." Diplomats, missionaries, soldiers and some Chinese Christians took refuge in the diplomatic [[Beijing Legation Quarter|Legation Quarter]]. They were besieged for 55 days by the Imperial Army of the Chinese government and the Boxers. George Makari says that the Boxers, "promoted a violent [[hatred]] of all those from other lands and made no effort to distinguish the beneficent from the rapacious ones.... They were unabashedly xenophobic."&lt;ref&gt;George Makari, ''Of Fear and Strangers: A History of Xenophobia'' (2021), pp 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; The Boxers were overthrown by an [[Eight Nation Alliance]] of American, Austro-Hungarian, British, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Russian troops—20,000 in all—that invaded China to lift the siege in August 1900.  The allies imposed the [[Boxer Protocol]] in 1901, with a massive annual cash indemnity to be paid by the Chinese government. The episode generated worldwide attention and denunciation of xenophobia.&lt;ref&gt;Makari, ''Of Fear and Strangers: A History of Xenophobia'' (2021), ch 4, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Cohen, '' History in Three Keys: The Boxers as Event, Experience, and Myth'' (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Chinese nationalism and xenophobia =====
Historian [[Mary C. Wright]] has argued that the combination of [[Chinese nationalism]] and xenophobia had a major impact on the Chinese worldview in the first half of the 20th century. Examining the bitterness and hatred which existed towards [[Americans]] and [[Demographics of Europe|Europeans]] in the decades before the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Communist takeover in 1949]], she argues:&lt;blockquote&gt;The crude fear of the white peril that the [[Qing dynasty|last imperial dynasty]] had been able to exploit in the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 had been submerged but not overcome, and expanding special privileges of foreigners were irritants in increasingly wide spheres of Chinese life. These fears and irritations provided a mass sounding board for what otherwise might have been rather arid denunciations of imperialists. It is well to remember that both Nationalists and Communists have struck this note.&lt;ref&gt;Mary C.  Wright, "Modern China in Transition, 1900–1950." ''The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'' 321.1 (1959): 1–8, at p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In further support see Donald Gillin, "China and the Foreigner, 1911 to 1950."

==== Indonesia ====
{{Main|Racism in Indonesia|Papua conflict|Discrimination against Chinese Indonesians}}

A number of discriminatory laws against [[Chinese Indonesian#Post-independence and New Order Era|Chinese Indonesians]] were enacted by the government of [[Indonesia]]. In 1959, President [[Sukarno]] approved [[PP 10/1959]] that forced Chinese Indonesians to close their businesses in rural areas and relocate into urban areas. Moreover, political pressures in the 1970s and 1980s restricted the role of the Chinese Indonesian in politics, academics, and the military. As a result, they were thereafter constrained professionally to becoming entrepreneurs and professional managers in trade, manufacturing, and banking. In 1998, [[May 1998 riots of Indonesia|Indonesia riots]] over higher food prices and rumors of hoarding by merchants and shopkeepers often degenerated into anti-Chinese attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=25 November 2016 |title=Jakarta's violent identity crisis: behind the vilification of Chinese-Indonesians |url=http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/nov/25/jakarta-chinese-indonesians-governor-ahok |website=[[The Guardian]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Schonhardt |first=Sara |date=26 November 2016 |title=In Indonesia, Fears Rise Among Ethnic Chinese Amid Blasphemy Probe |language=en-US |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/in-indonesia-fears-rise-among-ethnic-chinese-amid-blasphemy-probe-1480161601 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20220213045340/https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-indonesia-fears-rise-among-ethnic-chinese-amid-blasphemy-probe-1480161601 |archive-date=13 February 2022 |issn=0099-9660 |access-date=1 May 2022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The racial tension between the dominant poor [[Malaysian Malays|Malay Muslims]] and the minority wealthier Chinese has long characterized Malaysia. It was a major factor in the [[History of Singapore|separation of Singapore in 1965]] to become an independent, primarily Chinese nation.  Amy L. Freedman points to the electoral system, the centrality of ethnic parties, gerrymandering, and systematic discrimination against the Chinese in education and jobs as critical factors in xenophobia. Recently the goal of creating a more inclusive national identity has been emphasized.&lt;ref&gt;Amy L.

After 2010, xenophobia became increasingly prevalent in the widely used social media. Jiyeon Kang reports a common pattern scapegoating dark-skinned migrants by gender, race and class.

There are no laws within the Kingdom of Thailand which criminalize racial discrimination and the use of racist cliches. Unlike neighboring nations which were [[colonialism|colonized]], Thailand's history as an uncolonized state further shaped its existing laws.

Anti-refugee sentiment has been significant in Thailand, with a 2016 [[Amnesty International]] survey indicating that 74% of surveyed Thais do not believe (to varying degrees) that people should be able to take refuge in other countries to escape war or persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/ACT3041002016ENGLISH.PDF|title=Refugees Welcome Survey 2016|access-date=4 December 2019|archive-date=4 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191204111451/https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/ACT3041002016ENGLISH.PDF|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jordan]] does not allow entry to Jews who have visible signs of Judaism or possess personal religious items. The Jordanian ambassador to Israel replied to a complaint by a religious Jew who was denied entry by stating that security concerns required that travelers who are entering the Hashemite Kingdom should not do so with prayer shawls ([[Tallit]]) and phylacteries ([[Tefillin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jordan denies entry to Israeli with Jewish prayer items |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/jordan-denies-entry-to-israeli-with-jewish-prayer-items-1.279743 |date=10 July 2009 |work=Haaretz |access-date=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordanian authorities state that the policy is to ensure the Jewish tourists' safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Israeli tourists asked to hand over Jewish paraphernalia |url=http://www.eturbonews.com/4337/israeli-tourists-asked-hand-over-jewish-paraphernalia |date=13 August 2008 |publisher=eTurboNews |access-date=23 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211182920/http://www.eturbonews.com/4337/israeli-tourists-asked-hand-over-jewish-paraphernalia |archive-date=11 December 2008 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, six [[Breslov (Hasidic dynasty)|Breslov]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] were deported after attempting to enter Jordan to visit the tomb of [[Aaron]] / Sheikh Harun on [[Mount Hor]], near [[Petra]].

According to the 2004 U.S. State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Israel and the Occupied Territories, the Israeli government had done "little to reduce institutional, legal, and societal discrimination against the country's Arab citizens."&lt;ref name="state.gov-2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41723.htm |title=Israel and the occupied territories |publisher=State.gov |date=28 February 2005 |access-date=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2005 [[US Department of State]] report on Israel wrote: "[T]he government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however, there were problems in some areas, including... institutional, legal, and societal discrimination against the country's [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab citizens]]."&lt;ref name="USDS2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2005/61690.htm |title=Israel and the occupied territories |access-date=1 August 2006 |author=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor |date=8 March 2006 |work=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices – 2005 |publisher=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 U.S. State Department Country Report stated that Israeli law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, and the Israeli government effectively enforced these prohibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154463.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413173255/http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154463.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 April 2011 |title=2010 Human Rights Report: Israel and the occupied territories |publisher=State.gov |date=8 April 2011 |access-date=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Likud]] MK and Minister of Defense [[Moshe Arens]] has criticized the treatment of minorities in Israel, saying that they did not bear the full obligation of Israeli citizenship, nor were they extended the full privileges of citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Cite book |publisher=UPNE |isbn=978-1-58465-327-1 |last=Rebhun |first=Uzi |author2=Chaim Isaac Waxman |title=Jews in Israel: contemporary social and cultural patterns |year=2004 |page=[https://archive.org/details/jewsinisraelcont0000unse/page/472 472] |url=https://archive.org/details/jewsinisraelcont0000unse/page/472 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel]] (ACRI) published reports which documented racism in Israel, and the 2007 report suggested that [[anti-Arab racism]] was increasing in the country.

Al-Manar officials denied broadcasting any antisemitic incitement and they also stated that their group's position is anti-Israeli, not antisemitic. However, Hezbollah has directed strong rhetoric against both Israel and Jews, and it has cooperated in publishing and distributing outright antisemitic literature.

It used the [[Implicit-association test]] (a reaction-based psychological test designed to measure implicit racial bias).

There were recorded well over a hundred antisemitic attacks in [[Belgium]] in 2009. This was a 100% increase from the year before. The perpetrators were usually young males of immigrant background from the Middle East. In 2009, the Belgian city of [[Antwerp]], often referred to as Europe's last [[shtetl]], experienced a surge in antisemitic violence. [[Bloeme Evers-Emden]], an Amsterdam resident and [[Auschwitz]] survivor, was quoted in the newspaper ''[[Aftenposten]]'' in 2010: "The antisemitism now is even worse than before the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. The antisemitism has become more violent.

{{Further|Antisemitism in 21st century Germany}}
The period after Germany's loss of [[World War I]] led to the increased espousal of [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] and other forms of racism in the country's political discourse, for example, emotions which were initially expressed by members of the right-wing [[Freikorps]] finally culminated in the ascent of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933. The [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi Party's racial policy]] and the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg Race Laws]] against Jews and other non-[[Aryan race|Aryans]] represented the most explicit racist policies in twentieth century Europe. These laws deprived all Jews (including half-Jews and quarter-Jews) and all other non-Aryans of German citizenship. The official title of Jews became "subjects of the state". At first, the Nuremberg Race Laws only forbade racially mixed sexual relationships and marriages between Aryans and Jews but later they were extended to "[[Romani people|Gypsies]], [[Black people|Negroes]] or their bastard offspring".&lt;ref name="Burleigh1991"&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Burleigh |title=The Racial State: Germany 1933–1945 |date=7 November 1991 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-39802-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/racialstate00mich/page/49 49] |url=https://archive.org/details/racialstate00mich/page/49 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such interracial relationships were known as "racial pollution" [[Rassenschande]], and they became a criminal and punishable offence under the race laws.&lt;ref name="Burleigh1991" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=S.

Nazi Germany's Directive No.1306 stated: "Polishness equals subhumanity. Poles, Jews and gypsies are on the same inferior level."&lt;ref&gt;From Peace to War: Germany, Soviet Russia, and the World, 1939–1941 (1997), by Sheldon Dick ed. [[Bernd Wegner]], p.50&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1950s the steady arrival of Turkish workers led to xenophobia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to a 2012 survey, 18% of [[Turks in Germany]] believe that Jews are inferior human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Liljeberg Research International: [https://d171.keyingress.de/multimedia/document/228.pdf ''Deutsch-Türkische Lebens und Wertewelten 2012''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011112234/https://d171.keyingress.de/multimedia/document/228.pdf |date=11 October 2012 }}, July/August 2012, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Die Welt]]: [https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article108659406/Tuerkische-Migranten-hoffen-auf-muslimische-Mehrheit.html ''Türkische Migranten hoffen auf muslimische Mehrheit''], 17 August 2012.

As in other European countries, the [[Romani people]] faced disadvantages, including unequal treatment, discrimination, segregation and harassment. Negative stereotypes are often linked to Romani unemployment and reliance on state benefits.&lt;ref name="FRA"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2013-thematic-situation-report-3_en_1.pdf |title=Racism, discrimination, intolerance and extremism: learning from experiences in Greece and Hungary |publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) |date=December 2013 |access-date=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 and 2009 nine attacks took place against Romani in Hungary, resulting in six deaths and multiple injuries. According to the Hungarian curia (supreme court), these murders were motivated by [[Antiziganism|anti-Romani sentiment]] and sentenced the perpetrators to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name="FRA" /&gt;

==== Italy ====
{{Main|Racism in Italy}}

A new party emerged in the 1980s, [[Lega Nord]]. According to Gilda Zazzara, it started with identity-based claims and secessionist proposals for the North to break away from Southern Italy. It shifted to xenophobia and the demand that job priority be accorded to native Italian workers.&lt;ref&gt;Gilda Zazzara, " 'Italians First': Workers on the Right Amidst Old and New Populisms" ''International Labor &amp; Working-Class History'' (2018) Vol. 93, p101-112.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti-Roma]] sentiment in Italy takes the form of hostility, prejudice, discrimination or racism directed at Romani people. There's no reliable data for the total number of Roma people living in Italy, but estimates put it between 140,000 and 170,000. Many national and local political leaders engaged in rhetoric during 2007 and 2008 that maintained that the extraordinary rise in crime at the time was mainly a result of uncontrolled immigration of people of Roma origin from recent [[European Union]] member state Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hammarberg, "Memorandum following the visit to Italy on 19–20 June 2008," the [[Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights]], CommDH(2008)18, para. 26, 28 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; National and local leaders declared their plans to expel Roma from settlements in and around major cities and to deport illegal immigrants. The mayors of Rome and Milan signed "Security Pacts" in May 2007 that "envisaged the forced eviction of up to 10,000 Romani people."&lt;ref&gt;[[Amnesty International]], The State of the World's Human Rights 2008: Italy, POL 10/001/2008, June 2008, pp. 171–172&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a May 2008 poll 68% of Italians, wanted to see all of the country's approximately 150,000 Gypsies, many of them Italian citizens, expelled.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/17/italy 68% of Italians want Roma expelled – poll], ''[[The Guardian]]'', Tom Kington, Rome, 17 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The survey, published as mobs in Naples burned down Gypsy camps that month, revealed that the majority also wanted all Gypsy camps in Italy to be demolished.&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;

In early 2012 the Dutch right-wing [[Party for Freedom]] established an [[Anti-Slavic sentiment|anti-Slavic]] (predominantly [[Anti-Polish sentiment|anti-Polish]]) and [[Antiziganism|anti-Romani]] website, where native [[Dutch people]] could air their frustration about losing their job because of cheaper workers from [[Poland]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]] and other non-Germanic [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an countries. This led to commentaries involving [[hate speech]] and other racial prejudice mainly against Poles and Roma, but also aimed at other Central and Eastern European ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euobserver.com/news/115208|title=Dutch far right opens anti-Polish hotline|website=EUobserver}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2015 report by the [[OECD]] and [[European Commission|EU Commission]], 37% of young people born in the country with immigrant parents say they had experienced discrimination in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/06/23/racism-denmark-an-exchange/|title=Racism in the North: An Exchange|last1=Eakin|first1=Hugh|date=23 June 2016|access-date=14 December 2019|last2=Rose|first2=Flemming|language=en|issn=0028-7504|last3=Mchangama|first3=Jacob|journal=New York Review of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Netherlands]], antisemitic incidents, from verbal abuse to violence, are reported, allegedly connected with Islamic youth, mostly boys of Moroccan descent. A phrase made popular during football matches against the so-called Jewish football club [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] has been adopted by Muslim youth and is frequently heard at pro-Palestinian demonstrations: "Hamas, Hamas, Jews to the gas!" According to the Centre for Information and Documentation on Israel, a pro-Israel lobby group in the Netherlands, in 2009, the number of anti-Semitic incidents in [[Amsterdam]], the city that is home to most of the approximately 40,000 [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jews]], doubled compared to 2008.&lt;ref name="nrc.nl"&gt;Berkhout, Karel.

In 2010, the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] after one year of research, revealed that [[antisemitism]] was common among Norwegian [[Muslim]]s. Teachers at schools with large shares of Muslims revealed that Muslim students often "praise or admire Adolf Hitler for his killing of Jews", that "Jew-hate is legitimate within vast groups of Muslim students," and "Muslims laugh or command [teachers] to stop when trying to educate about the [[Holocaust]]." Additionally that "while some students might protest when some express support for [[terrorism]], none object when students express hate of Jews" and that it says in "the Quran that you shall kill Jews, all true Muslims hate Jews." Most of these students were said to be born and raised in Norway. One Jewish father also told that his child after school had been taken by a Muslim mob (though managed to escape), reportedly "to be taken out to the forest and hanged because he was a Jew".&lt;ref name="Jødiske barn blir hetset 2010"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=NRK |title=Nett-TV: Lørdagsrevyen 13.03.10 Jødiske barn blir hetset |date=13 March 2010 |url=https://www.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317183545/https://www.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057/ |archive-date=17 March 2010 |url-status=dead |language=no |access-date=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, especially after nationalistic uprisings in Poland in the 1860s, the government displayed xenophobia in its hostility toward ethnic minorities that did not speak Russian.

The extent and the targets of racist attitudes in the United Kingdom have varied over time. It has resulted in cases of discrimination, riots and [[Hate crime#United Kingdom|racially motivated murder]]s.

[[Slavery in Mauritania]] persists despite its abolition in 1980 and mostly affects the descendants of black Africans abducted into [[slavery]] who now live in [[Mauritania]] as "black [[Moors]]" or ''[[haratin]]'' and who partially still serve the "white Moors", or ''bidhan'', as slaves. The practice of slavery in Mauritania is most dominant within the traditional upper class of the Moors. For centuries, the ''haratin'' lower class, mostly poor black Africans living in rural areas, have been considered natural slaves by these Moors. Social attitudes have changed among most urban Moors, but in rural areas, the ancient divide remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L18334379.htm |title=Thomson Reuters Foundation |publisher=Thomson Reuters Foundation |access-date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
