{{Discrimination sidebar|Related}}
&lt;!-- Simple definition and simple example --&gt;
'''Intersectionality''' is a [[sociological]] [[Analytic frame|analytical framework]] for understanding how groups' and individuals' [[Social identity|social and political identities]] result in unique combinations of [[discrimination]] and [[Social privilege|privilege]]. Examples of these factors include [[gender]], [[caste]], [[sex]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[Social class|class]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[religion]], [[disability]], [[Human height|height]], [[ageing|age]], and [[Human body weight|weight]].&lt;ref name="Academia.edu"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Deckha, M. |date=November 2008 |url=https://wjlgs.law.wisc.edu/2008/volume-xxiii-no-2/ |title=Intersectionality and posthumanist visions of equality |journal=Wisconsin Journal of Law, Gender &amp; Society |volume=XXIII |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These intersecting and overlapping social identities may be both [[Empowerment|empowering]] and [[Oppression|oppressing]].&lt;ref name="Holley 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holley |first1=Lynn C. |last2=Mendoza |first2=Natasha S. |last3=Del-Colle |first3=Melissa M. |last4=Bernard |first4=Marquita Lynette |title=Heterosexism, racism, and mental illness discrimination: Experiences of people with mental health conditions and their families |journal=Journal of Gay &amp; Lesbian Social Services |date=2 April 2016 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=93–116 |doi=10.1080/10538720.2016.1155520 |s2cid=147454725}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zinn 1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zinn |first1=Maxine Baca |last2=Dill |first2=Bonnie Thornton |title=Theorizing Difference from Multiracial Feminism |journal=Feminist Studies |date=1996 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=321–331 |id={{ProQuest|233181156}} {{Gale|A18800342}} |doi=10.2307/3178416 |jstor=3178416 |url=https://philarchive.org/rec/ZINTDF|hdl=2027/spo.0499697.0022.206 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Relationship to older concepts of feminism; who's included? --&gt;
Intersectionality broadens the scope of the [[First-wave feminism|first]] and [[Second-wave feminism|second]] [[waves of feminism]], which largely focused on the experiences of women who were [[White women|white]], [[Middle class|middle-class]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=bell hooks |title=Ain't I a woman: Black women and feminism |date=2015 |isbn=978-1-138-82148-4 |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |oclc=886381091}}&lt;/ref&gt; to include the different experiences of [[women of color]], [[Poverty and gender|poor women]], [[immigrant women]], and other groups. Intersectional feminism aims to separate itself from [[white feminism]] by acknowledging women's differing experiences and identities.&lt;ref name="IWDA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://iwda.org.au/what-does-intersectional-feminism-actually-mean/ |title=What Does Intersectional Feminism Actually Mean? |date=11 May 2018 |publisher=International Women's Development Agency |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423154503/https://iwda.org.au/what-does-intersectional-feminism-actually-mean/ |archive-date=23 April 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Theory here--&gt;
The term ''intersectionality'' was coined by [[Kimberlé Crenshaw]] in 1989.{{r|Cooper 2016|p=385}} She describes how interlocking systems of [[Power (social and political)|power]] affect those who are most [[Social exclusion|marginalized in society]].{{r|Cooper 2016}} Activists and academics use the framework to promote [[Social equity|social]] and [[political egalitarianism]].&lt;ref name="IWDA" /&gt; Intersectionality opposes analytical systems that treat each axis of oppression in isolation. In this framework, for instance, discrimination against [[black women]] cannot be explained as a simple combination of [[misogyny]] and [[racism]], but as something more complicated.&lt;ref name="Crenshaw 2016a"&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Crenshaw |first1=Kimberlé |title=The urgency of intersectionality |url=https://www.ted.com/talks/kimberle_crenshaw_the_urgency_of_intersectionality/transcript |conference=TEDWomen 2016 |date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intersectionality engages in similar themes as [[triple oppression]], which is the oppression associated with being a poor or immigrant woman of color.

&lt;!--Critics here--&gt;
Criticism includes the framework's tendency to reduce individuals to specific demographic factors,&lt;ref name=Downing2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Downing |first1=Lisa |title=The body politic: Gender, the right wing and 'identity category violations' |journal=French Cultural Studies |date=November 2018 |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=367–377 |doi=10.1177/0957155818791075 |s2cid=165115259 |url=http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/53670526/Downing_August_Pre_Pub_Body_politic_article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its use as an ideological tool against other [[feminist theories]].&lt;ref name="intersectionality993"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tomlinson |first=Barbara |title=To Tell the Truth and Not Get Trapped: Desire, Distance, and Intersectionality at the Scene of Argument |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=993–1017 |doi=10.1086/669571 |date=Summer 2013 |s2cid=144641071}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have characterized the framework as ambiguous and lacking defined goals. As it is based in [[standpoint theory]], critics say the focus on subjective experiences can lead to contradictions and the inability to identify common causes of oppression. An analysis of academic articles published through December 2019 found that there are no widely adopted quantitative methods to investigate research questions informed by intersectionality and provided recommendations on analytic best practices for future research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guan |first1=Alice |last2=Thomas |first2=Marilyn |last3=Vittinghoff |first3=Eric |last4=Bowleg |first4=Lisa |last5=Mangurian |first5=Christina |last6=Wesson |first6=Paul |title=An investigation of quantitative methods for assessing intersectionality in health research: A systematic review |journal=SSM - Population Health |date=December 2021 |volume=16 |page=100977 |doi=10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100977|pmid=34869821 |pmc=8626832 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of academic articles published through May 2020 found that intersectionality is frequently misunderstood when bridging theory into quantitative methodology.&lt;ref name="Bauer2021"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bauer |first1=Greta R. |last2=Churchill |first2=Siobhan M. |last3=Mahendran |first3=Mayuri |last4=Walwyn |first4=Chantel |last5=Lizotte |first5=Daniel |last6=Villa-Rueda |first6=Alma Angelica |date=June 2021 |title=Intersectionality in quantitative research: A systematic review of its emergence and applications of theory and methods |journal=SSM - Population Health |language=en |volume=14 |page=100798 |doi=10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100798 |pmc=8095182 |pmid=33997247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of intersectionality was introduced to the field of legal studies by [[black feminist]] scholar [[Kimberlé Crenshaw]],&lt;ref name="Duran 2020"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Duran |first1=Antonio |last2=Jones |first2=Susan R. |editor1-last=Casey |editor1-first=Zachary A. |title=Encyclopedia of Critical Whiteness Studies in Education |date=2020 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-44483-6 |pages=310–320 |chapter=Intersectionality |doi=10.1163/9789004444836_041 |s2cid=242630915}}&lt;/ref&gt; who used the term in a pair of essays&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Crenshaw |first=Kimberle |date=1994 |title=Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence Against Women of Color |url=https://we.riseup.net/assets/139021/versions/1/crenshaw%20intersectionality.pdf }} {{webarchive|format=addlarchive|url1=https://web.archive.org/web/20230418140726/https://we.riseup.net/assets/139021/versions/1/crenshaw%20intersectionality.pdf|date1=18 April 2023|url2=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1229039}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Crenshaw |first=Kimberle |date=1989 |title=Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics |url=https://philpapers.org/archive/CREDTI.pdf }} {{webarchive | format=addlarchive | url1=https://web.archive.org/web/20230421233204/https://philpapers.org/archive/CREDTI.pdf | date1=21 April 2023 | url2=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&amp;context=uclf}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1989 and 1991.&lt;ref name="Cooper 2016"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=Brittney |editor1-last=Disch |editor1-first=Lisa |editor2-first=Mary |editor2-last=Hawkesworth |chapter=Intersectionality |title=The Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theory |year=2016 |pages=385–406 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-932858-1 |doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199328581.013.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before Kimberlé Crenshaw coined this term, several Black feminists had already articulated ideas reflecting intersectional thinking. Scholars like Anna Julia Cooper and [[Maria W. Stewart]] emphasized on the interconnected nature of racial and gender oppressions. In Cooper's publication of "A Voice from the South"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Cooper |first=Anna Julia |title=A Voice from the South |publisher=Aldine Printing House |year=1892 |isbn=9780598556370 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1892) emphasized on the importance of considering the 'whole race' by focusing on the lived experiences of Black women. Cooper highlighted that their oppression was just not racial or gender-based but a complex combination of the two.  

Intersectionality originated in [[critical race studies]] and demonstrates a multifaceted connection between race, gender, and other systems that work together to oppress, while also allowing privilege in other areas. Intersectionality is relative because it displays how race, gender, and other components "intersect" to shape the experiences of individuals. Crenshaw used intersectionality to denote how race, class, gender, and other systems combine to shape the experiences of many by making room for privilege.{{r|Crenshaw 1991}} Crenshaw used intersectionality to display the disadvantages caused by intersecting systems creating structural, political, and representational [[violence and intersectionality|aspects of violence]] against minorities in the workplace and society.{{r|Crenshaw 1991}} Crenshaw explained the dynamics that using gender, race, and other forms of power in politics and academics plays a big role in intersectionality.&lt;ref name="Cho, Crenshaw &amp; McCall 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cho |first1=Sumi |last2=Crenshaw |first2=Kimberlé Williams |last3=McCall |first3=Leslie |title=Toward a Field of Intersectionality Studies: Theory, Applications, and Praxis |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |date=June 2013 |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=785–810 |doi=10.1086/669608 |jstor=10.1086/669608 |s2cid=143982074 |url=https://via.library.depaul.edu/lawfacpubs/705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, long before Crenshaw, [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] theorized that the intersectional paradigms of race, class, and nation might explain specific aspects of the black political economy. [[Patricia Hill Collins]] writes: "Du Bois saw race, class, and nation not primarily as personal identity categories but as social hierarchies that shaped African-American access to status, poverty, and power."{{r|Collins 2000b|p=44}} Du Bois nevertheless omitted gender from his theory and considered it more of a personal identity category. [[Brittney Cooper|Britney Cooper]], in her book Beyond Respectability,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Cooper |first=Brittney C. |title=Beyond Respectability |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=2017 |isbn=9780252099540 |publication-date=May 3, 2017 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; addresses this omission by exploring how early Black female intellectuals such as Anna Julia Cooper and others critiqued and expanded upon these limited frameworks, emphasizing the interconnectedness of race, gender, and class in shaping Black women's experiences and political resistance. Cooper highlights how these early Black feminists established a critical intellectual tradition that prefigured later intersectional theories. In the 1970s, a group of black feminist women organized the [[Combahee River Collective]] in response to what they felt was an alienation from both white feminism and the male-dominated black liberation movement, citing the "interlocking oppressions" of racism, sexism and [[heteronormativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Roots of Intersectionality {{!}} University of Rochester School of Nursing |url=https://son.rochester.edu/newsroom/2022/intersectionality.html |website=son.rochester.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''DeGraffenreid v. General Motors'' (1976), Emma DeGraffenreid and four other black female auto workers alleged compound [[employment discrimination]] against black women as a result of [[General Motors]]' seniority-based system of [[layoff]]s. The courts weighed the allegations of race and gender discrimination separately, finding that the employment of African-American male factory workers disproved racial discrimination, and the employment of white female office workers disproved [[gender discrimination]]. The court declined to consider compound discrimination, and dismissed the case.&lt;ref name="HoSang"&gt;{{cite book |last1=HoSang |first1=Daniel M. |editor1-last=Burgett |editor1-first=Bruce |editor2-last=Hendler |editor2-first=Glenn |title=Keywords for American cultural studies |date=2020 |publisher=New York University Press |isbn=978-1-4798-6745-5 |pages=142–144 |edition=3rd |chapter=Intersectionality |doi=10.18574/9781479867455-038 |doi-broken-date=1 November 2024 |chapter-url=https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/intersectionality/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|Adewunmi}} Crenshaw argued that in cases such as this, the courts have tended to ignore black women's unique experiences by treating them as {{em|only}} women or {{em|only}} black.&lt;ref name="Coaston 2019"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Coaston |first1=Jane |title=The intersectionality wars |url=https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/5/20/18542843/intersectionality-conservatism-law-race-gender-discrimination |work=Vox |date=28 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|Crenshaw 1989|pp=141–143}}

The ideas behind intersectional feminism existed long before the term was coined. For example, [[Sojourner Truth]] exemplified intersectionality in her 1851 "[[Ain't I a Woman?|Ain't I a Woman]]" speech, where she spoke from her racialized position as a formerly enslaved woman to critique essentialist notions of [[femininity]].&lt;ref name="Brah"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brah |first1=Avtar |last2=Phoenix |first2=Ann |date=15 January 2013 |title=Ain't I A Woman? Revisiting Intersectionality |url=https://vc.bridgew.edu/jiws/vol5/iss3/8/ |journal=Journal of International Women's Studies |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=75–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Truth highlighted the differences in how society treated white and Black women, noting that white women are often regarded as emotional and delicate, while Black women were stereotyped as brutish and subjected to both gendered and racialized abuse. However, these observations were largely dismissed by many white feminists of the time, who prioritized the suffrage movement over addressing the intersecting oppressions faced by Black women.&lt;ref name="Truth"&gt;{{cite book |last=Truth |first=Sojourner |title=Available Means: An Anthology Of Women's Rhetoric(s) |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8229-7975-3 |editor1-last=Ritchie |editor1-first=Joy |pages=144–146 |chapter='Speech at the Woman's Rights Convention, Akron, Ohio' (1851) |doi=10.2307/j.ctt5hjqnj.28 |jstor=j.ctt5hjqnj.28 |editor2-last=Ronald |editor2-first=Kate}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Similarly, in her 1892 essay "The Colored Woman's Office," [[Anna J. Cooper|Anna Julia Cooper]] identified Black women as crucial agents of social change, emphasizing their unique understanding of multiple forms of oppression. &lt;ref name="Cooper 1892"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=Anna Julia |title=Social theory: the multicultural, global, and classic readings |publisher=Westview Press |year=2016 |isbn=978-0-8133-5044-8 |editor-last=Lemert |editor-first=Charles |edition=6th |location=Boulder, Colo. |chapter=The colored woman's office |orig-date=1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar [[bell hooks]], in her groundbreaking work "Ain't I a Woman? Black Women and Feminism"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=hooks |first=bell |title=Ain't I a Woman: Black Women and Feminism |publisher=Routledge |year=2014 |isbn=978-1138821514 |edition=2nd |publication-date=October 14, 2014 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1981), further critiqued the exclusion of Black women's experiences from mainstream feminist narratives and underscored the importance of addressing race, gender, and class as intersecting systems of oppression. [[Patricia Hill Collins]] later traced the intellectual roots of intersectionality to Black, [[Chicana feminism|Chicana]], Latina, Indigenous, and Asian American feminists active between 1960s and 1980s. She acknowledged earlier thinkers such as Cooper and [[Ida B. Wells]], as well as influential intellectuals like [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] and Nira Yuval-Davis, who explored similar ideas. By the 1980s, as [[second-wave feminism]] began to recede, scholars of color including [[Audre Lorde]], [[Gloria E. Anzaldúa]] and [[Angela Davis]] brought their lived experiences into academic discussion, shaping what would become known as "intersectionality" within race, class, and gender studies in U.S. academia. &lt;ref name="Collins 2015" /&gt;

As articulated by author [[bell hooks]], &lt;!-- no, that's how she styles herself like e e cummings --&gt; the emergence of intersectionality "challenged the notion that 'gender' was the primary factor determining a woman's fate".&lt;ref name="hooks 2014"&gt;{{cite book |last=hooks |first=bell |title=Feminist Theory: from margin to center |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2014 |orig-date=1984 |edition=3rd |isbn=978-1-138-82166-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical exclusion of black women from the feminist movement in the United States resulted in many black 19th- and 20th-century feminists, such as Anna Julia Cooper, challenging their historical exclusion. This disputed the ideas of earlier feminist movements, which were primarily led by white middle-class women, suggesting that women were a homogeneous category who shared the same life experiences.&lt;ref name="Davis 1983"&gt;{{cite book |last=Davis |first=Angela Y. |author-link=Angela Davis |title=Women, Race &amp; Class |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-394-71351-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once established that the forms of oppression experienced by white middle-class women were different from those experienced by black, poor, or disabled women, feminists began seeking ways to understand how gender, race, and class combine to "determine the female destiny".&lt;ref name="hooks 2014" /&gt;

The concept of intersectionality is intended to illuminate dynamics that have often been overlooked by feminist theory and movements.&lt;ref name="Thompson 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thompson |first1=Becky |title=Multiracial Feminism: Recasting the Chronology of Second Wave Feminism |journal=Feminist Studies |date=2002 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=337–360 |doi=10.2307/3178747 |jstor=3178747 |s2cid=152165042|hdl=2027/spo.0499697.0028.210 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Racial inequality was a factor that was largely ignored by first-wave feminism, which was primarily concerned with gaining political equality between white men and white women. Early women's rights movements often exclusively pertained to the membership, concerns, and struggles of white women.&lt;ref name="Fixmer-Oraiz"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Gendered Lives: Communication, Gender, &amp; Culture |last1=Fixmer-Oraiz |last2=Wood |first1=Natalie |first2=Julia |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-305-28027-4 |location=Boston, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|59–60}} Second-wave feminism worked to dismantle sexism relating to the perceived domestic purpose of women. While feminists during this time achieved success in the United States through the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], [[Title IX]], and ''[[Roe v.

Many recent academics, such as [[Leslie McCall]], have argued that the introduction of the intersectionality theory was vital to sociology and that before the development of the theory, there was little research that specifically addressed the experiences of people who are subjected to multiple forms of oppression within society.&lt;ref name=McCall2005&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCall |first1=Leslie |title=The Complexity of Intersectionality |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |date=March 2005 |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=1771–1800 |doi=10.1086/426800 |jstor=10.1086/426800 |hdl=20.500.12209/1062 |s2cid=16690122}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this idea was championed by [[Iris Marion Young]], arguing that differences must be acknowledged in order to find unifying social justice issues that create coalitions that aid in changing society for the better.&lt;ref name="Carastathis"&gt;{{Cite book |jstor=j.ctt1fzhfz8 |title=Intersectionality: Origins, Contestations, Horizons |last=Carastathis |first=Anna |date=2016 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |doi=10.2307/j.ctt1fzhfz8 |isbn=978-0-8032-8555-2 |editor-last1=Leong |editor-first1=Karen J. |editor-last2=Smith |editor-first2=Andrea}}{{Page needed|date=November 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, this relates to the ideals of the [[National Council of Negro Women]] (NCNW).&lt;ref name="Mueller 1954"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mueller |first1=Ruth Caston |title=The National Council of Negro Women, Inc. |journal=Negro History Bulletin |date=1954 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=27–31 |jstor=44175227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also has historical and theoretical links to the concept of simultaneity, which was advanced during the 1970s by members of the [[Combahee River Collective]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="Wiegman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wiegman |first=Robyn |year=2012 |chapter=Critical kinship (universal aspirations and intersectional judgements) |editor-last=Wiegman |editor-first=Robyn |title=Object lessons |page=244 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham, N.C. |isbn=978-0-8223-5160-3 |doi=10.1515/9780822394945 |s2cid=242615176 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/objectlessons00wieg/page/244/mode/1up |chapter-url-access=registration }} {{block indent |left=2 |Citing: {{cite book |last1=Hull |first1=Gloria T. |last2=Bell-Scott |first2=Patricia |last3=Smith |first3=Barbara |title=All the women are White, all the blacks are men, but some of us are brave: black women's studies |publisher=[[Feminist Press]] |location=Old Westbury, N.Y. |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-912670-92-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/allwomenarewhite00hull/mode/1up |url-access=registration}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneity is the simultaneous influences of race, class, gender, and sexuality, which informed the member's lives and their resistance to oppression.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Amanda Walker |title=Resituating the Crossroads: Theoretical Innovations in Black Feminist Ethnography |journal=Souls |date=2 October 2017 |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=401–415 |doi=10.1080/10999949.2018.1434350 |s2cid=149590053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the women of the Combahee River Collective advanced an understanding of African-American experiences that challenged analyses emerging from black and male-centered social movements, as well as those from mainstream cisgender, white, middle-class, heterosexual feminists.&lt;ref name="Norman 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Norman |first=Brian |title='We' in Redux: The Combahee River Collective's ''black Feminist Statement'' |journal=[[Differences (journal)|differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies]] |volume=18 |issue=2 |page=104 |doi=10.1215/10407391-2007-004 |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Black women leading the way.jpg|thumb|A crowd of people in a [[Black Lives Matter]] protest in 2015. The main focus is four black women, one holding a sign.]]
Since the term was coined, many feminist scholars have emerged with historical support for the intersectional theory. These women include [[Beverly Guy-Sheftall]] and her fellow contributors to ''Words of Fire: An Anthology of African-American Feminist Thought'', a collection of articles describing the multiple oppressions black women in America have experienced from the 1830s to contemporary times. Guy-Sheftall speaks about the constant premises that influence the lives of African-American women, saying, "black women experience a special kind of oppression and suffering in this country which is racist, sexist, and classist because of their dual race and gender identity and their limited access to economic resources."&lt;ref name="Guy-Sheftall"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Guy-Sheftall |first=Beverly |title=Words of fire: an anthology of African-American feminist thought |date=1995 |publisher=New Press |isbn=978-1-56584-256-4 |location=New York |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781565842564/mode/1up |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers and theorists were using intersectional analysis in their work before the term was coined. For example, [[Pauli Murray]] used the phrase "Jane Crow" in 1947 while at Howard University to describe the compounded challenges faced by black women in the Jim Crow south.&lt;ref&gt;"Jane Crow: Pauli

King published the article "Multiple Jeopardy, Multiple Consciousness: The Context of a Black Feminist Ideology" in 1988, just before Crenshaw coined the term ''intersectionality''. In the article, King addresses what soon became the foundation for intersectionality, saying, "black women have long recognized the special circumstances of our lives in the United States: the commonalities that we share with all women, as well as the bonds that connect us to the men of our race."&lt;ref name=King1988/&gt; Additionally, [[Gloria Wekker]] describes how [[Gloria E. Anzaldúa|Gloria Anzaldúa]]'s work as a [[Chicana feminism|Chicana]] feminist theorist exemplifies how "existent categories for identity are strikingly not dealt with in separate or mutually exclusive terms, but are always referred to in relation to one another".&lt;ref name="Buikema 2009"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Doing Gender in Media, Art and Culture: A Comprehensive Guide to Gender Studies |editor1=Buikema, Rosemarie |editor2=van der Tuin, Iris |publisher=Routeledge |location=London |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-415-49383-3 |pages=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist thought==
{{Feminism sidebar}}
In 1989, [[Kimberlé Crenshaw]] coined the term ''intersectionality'' as a way to help explain the oppression of [[African-American women]] in her essay "Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A black Feminist Critique of Anti-discrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics".&lt;ref name="Crenshaw 1989"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crenshaw |first1=Kimberlé |title=Demarginalizing the intersection of race and sex: a black feminist critique of antidiscrimination doctrine, feminist theory and antiracist politics |journal=University of Chicago Legal Forum |date=1989 |volume=1989 |issue=1 |pages=139–167 |url=http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/uclf/vol1989/iss1/8 |issn=0892-5593}} [https://archive.org/details/DemarginalizingTheIntersectionOfRaceAndSexABlackFeminis/mode/1up?view=theater Full text at Archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Crenshaw's term has risen to the forefront of national conversations about racial justice, [[identity politics]], and policing—and over the years has helped shape legal discussions.&lt;ref name="Two Decades"&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--anonymous author; no byline--&gt; |title=Kimberlé Crenshaw on Intersectionality, More than Two Decades Later |date=8 June 2017 |publisher=Columbia Law School |url=https://www.law.columbia.edu/news/archive/kimberle-crenshaw-intersectionality-more-two-decades-later |access-date=14 May 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adewunmi"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Adewunmi |first=Bim |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/lifestyle/2014/04/kimberl-crenshaw-intersectionality-i-wanted-come-everyday-metaphor-anyone-could |title=Kimberlé Crenshaw on intersectionality: 'I wanted to come up with an everyday metaphor that anyone could use' |date=2 April 2014 |work=[[New Statesman]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180518120135/https://www.newstatesman.com/lifestyle/2014/04/kimberl-crenshaw-intersectionality-i-wanted-come-everyday-metaphor-anyone-could |archive-date=18 May 2018 |url-access=limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her work, Crenshaw discusses [[Black feminism]], arguing that the experience of being a black woman cannot be understood in terms independent of either being black or a woman. Rather, it must include interactions between the two identities, which, she adds, should frequently reinforce one another.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2004"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thomas |first1=Sheila |last2=Crenshaw |first2=Kimberlé |title=Intersectionality: the double bind of race and gender |work=Perspectives Magazine |date=Spring 2004 |page=2 |publisher=[[American Bar Association]] |url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/perspectives_magazine/women_perspectives_Spring2004CrenshawPSP.authcheckdam.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118111551/http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/perspectives_magazine/women_perspectives_Spring2004CrenshawPSP.authcheckdam.pdf |archive-date=18 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to show that non-white women have a vastly different experience from white women due to their race and/or class and that their experiences are not easily voiced or amplified, Crenshaw explores two types of male violence against women: [[domestic violence]] and [[rape]]. Through her analysis of these two forms of male violence against women, Crenshaw says that the experiences of non-white women consist of a combination of both racism and sexism.&lt;ref name="Crenshaw 1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crenshaw |first1=Kimberle |title=Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color |journal=Stanford Law Review |date=July 1991 |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=1241–1299 |doi=10.2307/1229039 |jstor=1229039 |citeseerx=10.1.1.695.5934|s2cid=24661090 }} {{block indent |left=2 |Reprinted in: {{cite book |editor1-last=Crenshaw |editor1-first=Kimberlé |editor2-last=Gotanda |editor2-first=Neil |editor3-last=Peller |editor3-first=Gary |editor4-last=Thomas |editor4-first=Kendall |title=Critical Race Theory: The Key Writings that Formed the Movement |year=1995 |location=New York |publisher=The New Press |isbn=978-1-56584-271-7 |pages=357–384 |url=https://archive.org/details/critica_xxx_1995_00_1144/page/357/mode/1up?view=theater |url-access=registration}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; She says that because non-white women are present within discourses that have been designed to address either race or sex—but not both at the same time—non-white women are marginalized within both of these systems of oppression as a result.&lt;ref name="Crenshaw 1991" /&gt;

In her work, Crenshaw identifies three aspects of intersectionality that affect the visibility of non-white women: structural intersectionality, political intersectionality, and representational intersectionality. Structural intersectionality deals with how non-white women experience domestic violence and rape in a manner qualitatively different from white women. Political intersectionality examines how laws and policies intended to increase equality have paradoxically decreased the visibility of violence against non-white women. Finally, representational intersectionality delves into how [[Popular culture|pop culture]] portrayals of non-white women can obscure their own authentic lived experiences.&lt;ref name="Crenshaw 1991" /&gt;

Within Crenshaw's work, she delves into a few legal cases that exhibit the concept of political intersectionality and how anti-discrimination law has been historically limited. These cases include DeGraffenreid v Motors, Moore v Hughes Helicopter Inc., and Payne v Travenol. There are two commonalities, amongst others, that exist between these cases with the first being each respective court's inability to fully understand the multidimensionality of the plaintiff's intersecting identities. Second is the limited ability that the plaintiffs had to argue their case due to restrictions created by the very legislation that exists in opposition to discrimination such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as used against the plaintiffs in the DeGraffenreid v Motors case.&lt;ref&gt;Crenshaw, Kimberle.

The term gained prominence in the 1990s, particularly in the wake of the further development of Crenshaw's work in the writings of sociologist Patricia Hill Collins. Crenshaw's term, Collins says, replaced her own previous coinage "black feminist thought", and "increased the general applicability of her theory from African American women to all women".&lt;ref name="Mann 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Mann |first1=Susan A. |last2=Huffman |first2=Douglas J. |title=The decentering of second wave feminism and the rise of the third wave |journal=[[Science &amp; Society]] |volume=69 |issue=1 |pages=56–91 |jstor=40404229 |date=January 2005 |doi=10.1521/siso.69.1.56.56799}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}} Much like Crenshaw, Collins argues that cultural patterns of oppression are not only interrelated, but are bound together and influenced by the intersectional systems of society, such as race, gender, class, and ethnicity.{{r|Collins 2000b|p=42}} Collins describes this as "interlocking social institutions [that] have relied on multiple forms of segregation... to produce unjust results".&lt;ref name="Collins 2000a"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Collins |first1=Patricia Hill |title=Black feminist thought: knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment |date=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-92484-9 |page=277 |edition=2nd |url=https://archive.org/details/blackfeministtho0000coll/page/277/mode/1up?view=theater |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins sought to create frameworks to think about intersectionality, rather than expanding on the theory itself. She identified three main branches of study within intersectionality. One branch deals with the background, ideas, issues, conflicts, and debates within intersectionality. Another branch seeks to apply intersectionality as an analytical strategy to various [[social institutions]] in order to examine how they might perpetuate social inequality. The final branch formulates intersectionality as a critical praxis to determine how [[social justice]] initiatives can use intersectionality to bring about social change.&lt;ref name="Collins 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Collins |first=Patricia Hill |title=Intersectionality's definitional dilemmas |journal=[[Annual Review of Sociology]] |volume=41 |pages=1–20 |doi=10.1146/annurev-soc-073014-112142 |date=2015 |s2cid=145739525 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2023-10-22 |title=$1 Million Berggruen Philosophy Prize Awarded to Patricia Hill Collins – Berggruen Institute |url=https://www.berggruen.org/news/usd1-million-berggruen-philosophy-prize-awarded-to-patricia-hill-collins |access-date=2024-07-19 |website=www.berggruen.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She criticized mainstream feminism for failing to address the specific experiences of marginalized women, famously stating, "There is not such thing as a single-issue struggle because we do not live single-issue lives." Additionally, Lorde comments in her essay, ''The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house,'' that she lived in "a country where racism, sexism, and homophobia are inseparable,"&lt;ref name="Lorde 1984"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lorde |first=Audre |title=Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches |publisher=Crossing Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-5809-1186-3 |location=Berkeley, Calif. |pages=110–114 |chapter=The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House |orig-date=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; advocating for a collective approach to dismantling these overlapping systems of discrimination.

Though intersectionality began with the exploration of the interplay between gender and race, over time other identities and oppressions were added to the theory. For example, in 1981 [[Cherríe Moraga]] and [[Gloria Anzaldúa]] published the first edition of ''[[This Bridge Called My Back]]''. This anthology explored how classifications of sexual orientation and class also mix with those of race and gender to create even more distinct political categories. Many black, Latina, and Asian writers featured in the collection stress how their sexuality interacts with their race and gender to inform their perspectives. Similarly, poor women of color detail how their socio-economic status adds a layer of nuance to their identities, ignored or misunderstood by middle-class white feminists.&lt;ref name="Moraga"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Moraga |editor1-first=Cherríe |editor2-last=Anzaldúa |editor2-first=Gloria |title=This bridge called my back: writings by radical women of color |date=1983 |publisher=Kitchen Table; Women of Color Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-913175-03-3 |edition=2nd |url=https://archive.org/details/thisbridgecalled00mora/mode/1up?view=theater |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2022}}

[[Asian American]] women often report intersectional experiences that set them apart from other American women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Choi |first1=Jin Young |last2=Smith |first2=Mitzi J. |title=Minoritized Women Reading Race and Ethnicity: Intersectional Approaches to Constructed Identity and Early Christian Texts |date=24 September 2020 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-1-4985-9159-1 |page=112 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwD6DwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=asian+american&amp;pg=PA112 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, several studies have shown that East Asian women are considered more physically attractive than white women, and other women of color. Taken at face value, this may seem like a social advantage. However, if this perception is inspired by stereotypes of Asian women as "hyperfeminine", it can serve to perpetuate racialized stereotypes of Asian women as subordinate or oversexualized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ciurria |first1=Michelle |title=An Intersectional Feminist Theory of Moral Responsibility |date=6 December 2019 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-000-02484-5 |page=274 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6tvBDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=%22intersectional&amp;pg=PT274 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robin Zheng writes that widespread fetishization of East Asian women's physical features leads to "racial depersonalization": the separation of Asian women from their own individual attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hall |first1=Kim Q. |title=The Oxford Handbook of Feminist Philosophy |date=2021 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-062892-5 |page=143 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fl8tEAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=asian+racial+depersonalization&amp;pg=PA143 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to black feminists such as [[Kimberlé Crenshaw|Kimberle Crenshaw]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[bell hooks]], and [[Patricia Hill Collins]], experiences of class, gender, and sexuality cannot be adequately understood unless the influence of racialization is carefully considered. This focus on racialization was highlighted many times by scholar and feminist [[bell hooks]], specifically in her 1981 book ''[[Ain't I a Woman? (book)|Ain't I A Woman: Black Women and Feminism]]''.&lt;ref name="hooks 1981"&gt;{{cite book |author=bell hooks |title=Ain't I a woman: Black women and feminism |date=1981 |publisher=South End Press |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-89608-128-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/aintiwoman00bell/mode/1up?view=theater |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2022}} [[Patricia Hill Collins|Patricia Hill Collins's]] essay "Gender, black feminism, and black political economy" highlights her theory on the sociological crossroads between [[Second-wave feminism|modern]] and [[Post-modern feminism|post-modern feminist thought]].&lt;ref name="Collins 2000b"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Collins |first=Patricia Hill |date=March 2000 |title=Gender, black feminism, and black political economy |journal=[[Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]] |volume=568 |issue=1 |pages=41–53 |doi=10.1177/000271620056800105 |s2cid=146255922}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black feminists argue that an understanding of intersectionality is a vital element of gaining political and social equity and improving the societal structures that oppress individuals.&lt;ref name="Hutchinson 2011"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hutchinson, Janet R. |title=Women in Public Administration: theory and practice |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-7637-7725-8 |editor-last1=D'Agostino |editor-first1=Maria |location=Sudbury, Mass. |page=8 |chapter=Feminist theories and their application to public administration |editor-last2=Levine |editor-first2=Helisse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chiara Bottici]] has argued that criticisms of intersectionality that find it to be incomplete, or argue that it fails to recognize the specificity of women's oppression, can be met with an [[anarcha-feminism]] that recognizes "that there is something ''specific'' about the oppression of women and that in order to fight it you have to fight ''all'' other forms of oppression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bottici |first=Chiara |author-link=Chiara Bottici |title=Bodies in Plural: Towards an Anarcha-feminist Manifesto |journal=[[Thesis Eleven]] |volume=142 |issue=1 |year=2017 |page=95 |doi=10.1177/0725513617727793 |s2cid=148911963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cheryl Townsend Gilkes]] expands on this by pointing out the value of centering on the experiences of black women. Joy James takes things one step further by "using paradigms of intersectionality in interpreting social phenomena". Collins later integrated these three views by examining a black political economy through the centering of black women's experiences and the use of a theoretical framework of intersectionality.{{r|Collins 2000b|p=44}}

Collins uses a [[Marxist feminist]] approach and applies her intersectional principles to what she calls the "work/family nexus and black women's poverty". In her 2000 article "Black Political Economy" she describes how, in her view, the intersections of [[consumer racism]], gender hierarchies, and disadvantages in the labor market can be centered on black women's unique experiences. Considering this from a historical perspective and examining interracial marriage laws and property inheritance laws creates what Collins terms a "distinctive work/family nexus that in turn influences the overall patterns of black political economy".{{r|Collins 2000b|pp=45–46}} For example, [[anti-miscegenation laws]] effectively suppressed the upward economic mobility of black women.

The intersectionality of race and gender has been shown to have a visible impact on the labor market. "Sociological research clearly shows that accounting for education, experience, and skill does not fully explain significant differences in labor market outcomes."&lt;ref name="Browne &amp; Misra 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Browne |first1=Irene |last2=Misra |first2=Joya |title=The Intersection of Gender and Race in the Labor Market |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |date=August 2003 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=487–513 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100016 |jstor=30036977}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|506}} The three main domains in which we see the impact of intersectionality are wages, discrimination, and domestic labor. Those who experience privilege within the social hierarchy in terms of race, gender, and socio-economic status are less likely to receive lower wages, to be subjected to stereotypes and discriminated against, or to be hired for exploitative domestic positions. Studies of the labor market and intersectionality provide a better understanding of economic inequalities and the implications of the multidimensional impact of race and gender on social status within society.&lt;ref name="Browne &amp; Misra 2003"/&gt;{{rp|506–507}}

==Forms: structural, political, representational==
Kimberlé Crenshaw, in "Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence Against Women of Color",&lt;ref name="Crenshaw 1991"/&gt; uses and explains three different forms of intersectionality to describe the violence that women experience. According to Crenshaw, there are three forms of intersectionality: structural, political, and representational intersectionality.

Structural intersectionality is used to describe how different structures work together and create a complex which highlights the differences in the experiences of women of color with domestic violence and rape. Structural intersectionality entails the ways in which classism, sexism, and racism interlock and oppress women of color while molding their experiences in different arenas. Crenshaw's analysis of structural intersectionality was used during her field study of battered women. In this study, Crenshaw uses intersectionality to display the multilayered oppressions that women who are victims of domestic violence face.&lt;ref name=Pedulla2014/&gt;

Political intersectionality highlights two conflicting systems in the political arena, which separates women and women of color into two subordinate groups.&lt;ref name=Pedulla2014/&gt; The experiences of women of color differ from those of white women and men of color due to their race and gender often intersecting. White women suffer from gender bias, and men of color suffer from racial bias; however, both of their experiences differ from that of women of color, because women of color experience both racial and gender bias. According to Crenshaw, a political failure of the antiracist and feminist discourses was the exclusion of the intersection of race and gender that places priority on the interest of "people of color" and "women", thus disregarding one while highlighting the other. Political engagement should reflect support of women of color; a prime example of the exclusion of women of color that shows the difference in the experiences of white women and women of color is the women's suffrage march.&lt;ref name=King1988&gt;{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=Deborah K. |title=Multiple Jeopardy, Multiple Consciousness: The Context of a Black Feminist Ideology |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |date=1 October 1988 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=42–72 |doi=10.1086/494491 |s2cid=143446946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representational intersectionality advocates for the creation of imagery that is supportive of women of color. Representational intersectionality condemns sexist and racist marginalization of women of color in representation. Representational intersectionality also highlights the importance of women of color having representation in media and contemporary settings.

==Key concepts==
===Interlocking matrix of oppression===
Collins refers to the various intersections of social inequality as the [[matrix of domination]]. These are also known as "vectors of oppression and privilege".&lt;ref name="Ritzer 2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ritzer |first1=George |author1-link=George Ritzer |last2=Stepinisky |first2=Jeffrey |title=Contemporary sociological theory and its classical roots: the basics |pages=204–207 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |edition=4th |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-07-802678-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|204}} These terms refer to how differences among people (sexual orientation, class, race, age, etc.) serve as oppressive measures towards women and change the experience of living as a woman in society. Collins, [[Audre Lorde]] (in ''[[Sister Outsider]]''), and [[bell hooks]] point towards either/or thinking as an influence on this oppression and as further intensifying these differences.&lt;ref name="Dudley 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dudley |first=Rachel A. |title=Confronting the concept of intersectionality: the legacy of Audre Lorde and contemporary feminist organizations |journal=McNair Scholars Journal |volume=10 |issue=1 |page=5 |date=2006 |url=https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/mcnair/vol10/iss1/5/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201081159/https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/mcnair/vol10/iss1/5/ |archive-date=1 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Collins refers to this as the construct of dichotomous oppositional difference. This construct is characterized by its focus on differences rather than similarities.&lt;ref name="Collins 1986"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=Patricia Hill |title=Learning from the Outsider Within: The Sociological Significance of Black Feminist Thought |journal=Social Problems |date=October 1986 |volume=33 |issue=6 |pages=S14–S32 |doi=10.2307/800672 |jstor=800672 |s2cid=144491582|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|S20}} Lisa A. Flores suggests, when individuals live in the borders, they "find themselves with a foot in both worlds". The result is "the sense of being neither" exclusively one identity nor another.&lt;ref name="Flores 1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Flores |first1=Lisa A. |title=Creating discursive space through a rhetoric of difference: Chicana feminists craft a homeland |journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech |date=May 1996 |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=142–156 |doi=10.1080/00335639609384147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standpoint epistemology and the outsider within===
Both Collins and [[Dorothy E. Smith|Dorothy Smith]] have been instrumental in providing a sociological definition of [[standpoint theory]]. A standpoint is an individual's world perspective. The theoretical basis of this approach views societal knowledge as being located within an individual's specific geographic location. In turn, knowledge becomes distinct and subjective; it varies depending on the social conditions under which it was produced.&lt;ref name="Mann 1997"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Mann |first1=Susan A. |last2=Kelley |first2=Lori R. |title=Standing at the crossroads of modernist thought: Collins, Smith, and the new feminist epistemologies |journal=[[Gender &amp; Society]] |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=391–408 |doi=10.1177/089124397011004002 |date=August 1997 |s2cid=55757598}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|392}}

The concept of the outsider within refers to a standpoint encompassing the [[Self (sociology)|self]], family, and society.&lt;ref name="Collins 1986"/&gt;{{rp|S14}} This relates to the specific experiences to which people are subjected as they move from a common cultural world (i.e., family) to that of modern society.&lt;ref name="Ritzer 2013" /&gt;{{rp|207}} Therefore, even though a woman—especially a Black woman—may become influential in a particular field, she may feel as though she does not belong. Her personality, behavior, and cultural being overshadow her value as an individual; thus, she becomes the outsider within.&lt;ref name="Collins 1986"/&gt;{{rp|S14}}

===Resisting oppression===
Speaking from a [[critical theory|critical]] standpoint, Collins points out that Brittan and Maynard say that "domination always involves the [[objectification]] of the dominated; all forms of oppression imply the devaluation of the subjectivity of the oppressed".&lt;ref name="Collins 1986"/&gt;{{rp|S18}} She later notes that self-valuation and self-definition are two ways of resisting oppression, and claims the practice of [[self-awareness]] helps to preserve the self-esteem of the group that is being oppressed while allowing them to avoid any [[Dehumanization|dehumanizing]] outside influences.

Marginalized groups often gain a status of being an "other".&lt;ref name="Collins 1986"/&gt;{{rp|S18}} In essence, you are "an other" if you are different from what [[Audre Lorde]] calls the mythical [[Normality (behaviour)|norm]]. [[Gloria Anzaldúa]], scholar of Chicana cultural theory, theorized that the sociological term for this is "[[othering]]", i.e. specifically attempting to establish a person as unacceptable based on a certain, unachieved criterion.&lt;ref name="Ritzer 2013" /&gt;{{rp|205}}

=== Intersectionality and gender ===
Intersectional theories in relation to gender recognize that each person has their own mix of identities which combine to create them, and where these identities "meet in the middle"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=What Is Intersectionality? {{!}} Intersections of Gender |url=https://www.ualberta.ca/intersections-gender/about/about-intersectionality.html#:~:text=Intersectional%20research%20design%20understands%20that,,%20ability,%20indigeneity%20and%20income. |access-date=2023-05-11 |website=www.ualberta.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; therein lies each person's intersectionality. These intersections lie between components such as class, race, religion, ethnicity, ability, income, indignity, and any other part of a person's identity which shapes their life, and the way others treat them. Stephanie A. Shields in her article on intersectionality and gender&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Shields |first=Stephanie |date=18 July 2008 |title=Gender:An Intersectionality Perspective |url=http://www.joycerain.com/uploads/2/3/2/0/23207256/gender_and_intersectionality.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; explains how each part of someones identity "serve as organizing features of social relations, mutually constitute, reinforce, and naturalize one another."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Shields explains how one aspect can not exist individually, rather it "takes its meaning as a category in relation to another category."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Practical applications==
{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=March 2017}}
Intersectionality has been applied in many fields from politics,&lt;ref name="Hancock 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hancock |first=Ange-Marie |title=Intersectionality as a normative and empirical paradigm |journal=[[Politics &amp; Gender]] |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=248–254 |doi=10.1017/S1743923X07000062 |date=June 2007 |s2cid=144145167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holvino 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holvino |first=Evangelina |title=Intersections: The simultaneity of race, gender and class in organization studies |journal=[[Gender, Work &amp; Organization]] |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=248–277 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0432.2008.00400.x |date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; education&lt;ref name=McCall2005/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooper 1892"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=Sandra J. |title=Complex subjectivities: class, ethnicity, and race in women's narratives of upward mobility |journal=[[Journal of Social Issues]] |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=803–820 |doi=10.1046/j.0022-4537.2003.00091.x |date=December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; healthcare,&lt;ref name="Kelly 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kelly |first=Ursula A. |title=Integrating intersectionality and biomedicine in health disparities research |journal=Advances in Nursing Science |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=E42–E56 |doi=10.1097/ANS.0b013e3181a3b3fc |pmid=19461221 |date=April–June 2009 |s2cid=26510963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Viruell-Fuentes et al 2012" /&gt; and employment, to economics.&lt;ref name="Ladson-Billings Tate 1995" /&gt; Today, intersectionality serves as a critical framework in addressing issues such as reproductive justice, where the intersection of race, class, and gender shapes women of color's access to healthcare and family planning resources. For example, the work of [[Loretta Ross]] and the SisterSong Collective&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Sister Song |url=https://www.sistersong.net/ |access-date=2024-10-29 |website=Sister Song |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; has emphasized how policies disproportionately affect Black, Indigenous, and Latina women, highlighting the importance of applying an intersectional lens in policy-making. This ensures that systematic disparities are identified and addressed to create equitable healthcare policies and resources for marginalized communities. However, little good-quality quantitative research has been done to support or undermine the practical uses  of intersectionality, owing to misapplication of theoretical concepts and problems in methodology.&lt;ref name="Bauer2021" /&gt;

For example, within the institution of education, Sandra Jones' research on working-class women in academia takes into consideration meritocracy within all social strata, but argues that it is complicated by race and the external forces that oppress.&lt;ref name="Jones 2003" /&gt; Additionally, people of color often experience differential treatment in the healthcare system. For example, in the period immediately after [[9/11]] researchers noted [[low birth weight]]s and other poor birth outcomes among Muslim and Arab Americans, a result they connected to the increased racial and religious discrimination of the time.&lt;ref name="Lauderdale 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lauderdale |first1=Diane S. |title=Birth Outcomes for Arabic-Named Women in California Before and After September 11 |journal=Demography |date=2006 |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=185–201 |doi=10.1353/dem.2006.0008 |pmid=16579214 |s2cid=12752541 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have also argued that immigration policies can affect health outcomes through mechanisms such as [[Stress (biology)#Overview|stress]], restrictions on access to health care, and the [[social determinants of health]].&lt;ref name="Viruell-Fuentes et al 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Viruell-Fuentes |first1=Edna A. |last2=Miranda |first2=Patricia Y. |last3=Abdulrahim |first3=Sawsan |title=More than culture: Structural racism, intersectionality theory, and immigrant health |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |date=December 2012 |volume=75 |issue=12 |pages=2099–2106 |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.12.037 |pmid=22386617|s2cid=12047435 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Women's Institute for Science, Equity and Race]] advocates for the disaggregation of data in order to highlight intersectional identities in all kinds of research.&lt;ref name="Ryssdal 2020"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ryssdal |first1=Kai |last2=Hollenhorst |first2=Maria |title=How's the economy? vs. how's the economy for each of us? |url=https://www.marketplace.org/2020/06/08/hows-the-economy-vs-hows-the-economy-for-each-of-us/ |work=Marketplace |date=8 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, applications with regard to property and wealth can be traced to the American historical narrative that is filled "with tensions and struggles over property—in its various forms. From the removal of Native Americans (and later [[Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese Americans]]) from the land, to military conquest of the Mexicans, to the construction of Africans as property, the ability to define, possess, and own property has been a central feature of power in America&amp;nbsp;... [and where] social benefits accrue largely to property owners."&lt;ref name="Ladson-Billings Tate 1995"&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.4324/9781315709796-2 |chapter=Toward a Critical Race Theory of Education |title=Critical Race Theory in Education |year=2016 |last1=Ladson-Billings |first1=Gloria |last2=Tate |first2=William F. |pages=10–31 |isbn=978-1-315-70979-6 |s2cid=140276325 |chapter-url=https://www.unco.edu/education-behavioral-sciences/pdf/TowardaCRTEduca.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; One could apply the intersectionality framework analysis to various areas where race, class, gender, sexuality and ability are affected by policies, procedures, practices, and laws in "context-specific inquiries, including, for example, analyzing the multiple ways that race and gender interact with class in the labor market; interrogating the ways that states constitute regulatory regimes of identity, reproduction, and family formation";&lt;ref name="Cho, Crenshaw &amp; McCall 2013"/&gt; and examining the inequities in "the power relations [of the intersectionality] of whiteness&amp;nbsp;...

===Intersectionality in a global context===
[[file:Dyke*Line auf dem Jungfernstieg und neuen Jungfernstieg und auf Booten auf der Binnenalster 002.jpg|thumb|Intersectionality at a Dyke March in Hamburg, Germany, 2020]]
Over the last couple of decades in the [[European Union]] (EU), there has been discussion regarding the intersections of social classifications. Before Crenshaw coined her definition of intersectionality, there was a debate on what these societal categories were. The once definite borders between the categories of gender, race, and class have instead fused into a multidimensional intersection of "race" that now includes religion, sexuality, ethnicities, etc. In the EU and UK, these intersections are referred to as the notion of "multiple discrimination". Although the EU passed a non-discrimination law which addresses these multiple intersections; there is however debate on whether the law is still proactively focusing on the proper inequalities.&lt;ref name="Schiek 2011"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schiek |first1=Dagmar |last2=Lawson |first2=Anna |author2-link= Anna Lawson |title=European Union Non-discrimination Law and Intersectionality: Investigating the Triangle of Racial, Gender and Disability Discrimination |date=2011 |publisher=Ashgate |isbn=978-0-7546-7980-6}}{{page needed|date=July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the EU, intersectional categories have also been considered. In ''Analyzing Gender, Intersectionality, and Multiple Inequalities: Global, Transnational and Local Contexts'', the authors argue: "The impact of patriarchy and traditional assumptions about gender and families are evident in the lives of Chinese migrant workers (Chow, Tong), sex workers and their clients in South Korea (Shin), and Indian widows (Chauhan), but also Ukrainian migrants (Amelina) and Australian men of the new global middle class (Connell)." This text suggests that there are many more intersections of discrimination for people around the globe than Crenshaw originally accounted for in her definition.&lt;ref name="Chow 2011"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chow |first1=Esther Ngan-Ling |last2=Segal |first2=Marcia Texler |last3=Lin |first3=Tan |title=Analyzing Gender, Intersectionality, and Multiple Inequalities: Global-transnational and Local Contexts |date=2011 |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing |isbn=978-0-85724-744-5}}{{page needed|date=March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chandra Mohanty discusses alliances between women throughout the world as intersectionality in a global context. She rejects the western feminist theory, especially when it writes about global women of color and generally associated "third world women". She argues that "third world women" are often thought of as a homogeneous entity, when, in fact, their experience of oppression is informed by their geography, history, and culture. When western feminists write about women in the global South in this way, they dismiss the inherent intersecting identities that are present in the dynamic of feminism in the global South. Mohanty questions the performance of intersectionality and relationality of power structures within the US and colonialism and how to work across identities with this history of colonial power structures.&lt;ref name="Mohanty 1984"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mohanty |first1=Chandra Talpade |title=Under Western Eyes: Feminist Scholarship and Colonial Discourses |journal=Boundary 2 |date=1984 |volume=12/13 |pages=333–358 |id={{INIST|11910852}} |doi=10.2307/302821 |jstor=302821}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of homogeneity and intersecting identities can be seen through [[feminism in India]], which goes over how women in India practice feminism within social structures and the continuing effects of colonization that differ from that of Western and other non-Western countries.

This is elaborated on by Christine Bose, who discusses a global use of intersectionality which works to remove associations of specific inequalities with specific institutions while showing that these systems generate intersectional effects. She uses this approach to develop a framework that can analyze gender inequalities across different nations and differentiates this from an approach (the one that Mohanty was referring to) which, one, paints national-level inequalities as the same and, two, differentiates only between the global North and South. This is manifested through the intersection of global dynamics like economics, migration, or violence, with regional dynamics, like histories of the nation or gendered inequalities in education and property education.&lt;ref name="Bose 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bose |first1=Christine E. |title=Intersectionality and Global Gender Inequality |journal=Gender &amp; Society |date=February 2012 |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=67–72 |doi=10.1177/0891243211426722 |s2cid=145233506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an issue globally with the way the law interacts with intersectionality. For example, the UK's legislation to protect workers' rights has a distinct issue with intersectionality. Under the Equality Act 2010, the things that are listed as 'protected characteristics' are "age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation".&lt;ref name="farrer.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.farrer.co.uk/news-and-insights/blogs/intersectionality-what-is-it-and-why-does-it-matter-for-employers/# |title=Intersectionality: What is it and why does it matter for employers?|date=9 August 2023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Section 14 contains a provision to cover direct discrimination on up to two combined grounds—known as combined or dual discrimination. However, this section has never been brought into effect as the government deemed it too 'complicated and burdensome' for businesses."&lt;ref name="farrer.co.uk"/&gt; This demonstrates systematic neglect of the issues that intersectionality presents, because the UK courts have explicitly decided not to cover intersectional discrimination in their courts.

This neglect of an intersectional framework can often lead to dire consequences. The [[African American Policy Forum]] (AAPF) describes a certain example where immigrant women's lives are threatened by their abusive citizen spouses. In ''A primer on intersectionality'', the authors argue that earlier immigration reform (which required spouses who immigrated to the US to marry American citizens to remain properly married for two years before they were eligible to receive permanent resident status) provided "no exceptions for battered women who often faced the risk of serious injury and death on the one hand, or deportation on the other." They continue to argue that advocates of several kinds hadn't originally considered this particular struggle many immigrant women face, including advocates for fairer immigration policies and advocates for domestic violence survivors.&lt;ref&gt;African American Policy Form. (n.d.). ''A primer on intersectionality''. https://www.aapf.org/_files/ugd/62e126_19f84b6cbf6f4660bac198ace49b9287.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Marie-Claire Belleau argues for "strategic intersectionality" in order to foster cooperation between feminisms of different ethnicities.&lt;ref name="Belleau 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Belleau |first=Marie-Claire |chapter=L'intersectionalité: Feminisms in a divided world; Québec-Canada |editor-last1=Orr |editor-first1=Deborah |title=Feminist Politics: identity, difference, and agency |pages=51–62 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers |location=Lanham, Md. |isbn=978-0-7425-4778-0 |display-editors=etal |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51}} She refers to different ''nat-cult'' (national-cultural) groups that produce different types of feminisms. Using [[Culture of Quebec|Québécois]] nat-cult as an example, Belleau says that many nat-cult groups contain infinite sub-identities within themselves, arguing that there are endless ways in which different feminisms can cooperate by using strategic intersectionality, and that these partnerships can help bridge gaps between "dominant and marginal" groups.&lt;ref name="Belleau 2007"/&gt;{{rp|54}} Belleau argues that, through strategic intersectionality, differences between nat-cult feminisms are neither essentialist nor universal, but should be understood as resulting from socio-cultural contexts. Furthermore, the performances of these nat-cult feminisms are also not essentialist. Instead, they are strategies.&lt;ref name="Belleau 2007"/&gt;

Across diverse cultural and geopolitical contexts, intersectionality has proven to be a versatile framework for analyzing overlapping systems of power and inequality. For instance, in Latin America, [[Maria Lugones]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lugones |first=María |date=2007 |title=Heterosexualism and the Colonial / Modern Gender System |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4640051 |journal=Hypatia |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=186–209 |jstor=4640051 |issn=0887-5367}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the concept of the "coloniality of gender" to explore how colonial histories intersect race, gender, and class, creating unique forms of oppression for Indigenous and Afro-descendant women. Her work reveals the imposition of Eurocentric gender norms during colonial rule, which marginalized non-Western gender identities and social structures. Similarly, in South Asia, Dalit feminists have drawn on intersectional analysis to emphasize the compounded marginalization faced by Dalit women, who experience both caste-based and gender-based discrimination. Scholars such as [[Thenmozhi Soundararajan]] argue in their works like, "The Trauma of Caste"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Soundararajan |first=Thenmozhi |title=The Trauma of Caste |publisher=North Atlantic Books |year=2022 |isbn=9781623177669 |location=United States of America |publication-date=November 15, 2022 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; that mainstream feminist frameworks often neglect these intersecting oppressions, calling for a more nuanced analysis that recognizes caste as a central axis of inequality. These adaptations illustrate, how intersectionality, far from being a static theory, continues to evolve as a powerful tool for addressing region-specific systems of exclusion and privilege. 

===Transnational intersectionality===

About the effect of the state on identity formation, Patil says: "If we continue to neglect cross-border dynamics and fail to problematize the nation and its emergence via transnational processes, our analyses will remain tethered to the spatialities and temporalities of colonial modernity."&lt;ref name="Vrushali"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Patil |first1=Vrushali |title=From Patriarchy to Intersectionality: A Transnational Feminist Assessment of How Far We've Really Come |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |date=1 June 2013 |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=847–867 |doi=10.1086/669560 |jstor=10.1086/669560 |s2cid=144680534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social work===
In the field of [[social work]], proponents of intersectionality hold that unless service providers take intersectionality into account, they will be of less use for various segments of the population, such as those reporting domestic violence or disabled victims of abuse. According to intersectional theory, the practice of [[domestic violence]] counselors in the [[United States]] urging all women to report their abusers to police is of little use to [[women of color]] due to the history of racially motivated [[police brutality]], and those counselors should adapt their counseling for women of color.&lt;ref name="Bent-Goodley et al"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bent-Goodley, Tricia B. |author2=Chase, Lorraine |author3=Circo, Elizabeth A. |author4=Antá Rodgers, Selena T. |chapter=Our survival, our strengths: understanding the experiences of African American women in abusive relationships |editor-last1=Lockhart |editor-first1=Lettie |editor-last2=Danis |editor-first2=Fran S. |title=Domestic violence: intersectionality and culturally competent practice |page=77 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-231-14027-0 |year=2010 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/domesticviolence0000unse_e7x2/page/77/mode/1up |chapter-url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women with disabilities encounter more frequent domestic abuse with a greater number of abusers. Health care workers and personal care attendants perpetrate abuse in these circumstances, and women with disabilities have fewer options for escaping the abusive situation.&lt;ref name="Cramer 2010"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cramer, Elizabeth P. |author2=Plummer, Sara-Beth |chapter=Social work practice with abused persons with disabilities |editor-last1=Lockhart |editor-first1=Lettie |editor-last2=Danis |editor-first2=Fran S. |title=Domestic violence: intersectionality and culturally competent practice |pages=131–134 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-231-14027-0 |year=2010 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/domesticviolence0000unse_e7x2/page/131/mode/1up |chapter-url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a "silence" principle concerning the intersectionality of women and disability, which maintains an overall social denial of the prevalence of abuse among the disabled and leads to this abuse being frequently ignored when encountered.&lt;ref name="Chenoweth"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chenoweth |first=Lesley |title=Violence and women with disabilities: silence and paradox |journal=[[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=391–411 |doi=10.1177/1077801296002004004 |date=December 1996 |s2cid=56939366}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paradox is presented by the overprotection of people with disabilities combined with the expectations of promiscuous behavior of disabled women.&lt;ref name="Cramer 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chenoweth" /&gt; This leads to limited autonomy and social isolation of disabled individuals, which place women with disabilities in situations where further or more frequent abuse can occur.&lt;ref name="Cramer 2010" /&gt;

===Situated intersectionality===
Expanding on Crenshaw's framework, migration researcher Nira Yuval-Davis proposed the concept of situated intersectionality as a theoretical framework that can encompass different types of inequalities, simultaneously (ontologically), but enmeshed (concretely), and based on a dialogical epistemology which can incorporate "differentially located situated gazes" at these inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yuval-Davis |first1=Nira |date=2015|title=Situated Intersectionality and Social Inequality |journal=[[Raisons Politiques]] |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=91–100|doi=10.3917/rai.058.0091 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reilly, Bjørnholt and Tastsoglou note that "Yuval-Davis shares [[Martha Fineman|Fineman's]] critical stance vis-à-vis the fragmentising and essentialising tendencies of identity politics, but without resorting to a universalism that eschews difference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reilly |first1=Niamh |last2=Bjørnholt |first2=Margunn |last3=Tastsoglou |first3=Evangelia |editor1-last=Freedman |editor1-first=Jane |editor2-last=Sahraoui |editor2-first=Nina |editor3-last=Tastsoglou |editor3-first=Evangelia|date=2022 |title=Gender-Based Violence in Migration |isbn=978-3-031-07929-0 |pages=29–56 |chapter=Vulnerability, Precarity and Intersectionality: A Critical Review of Three Key Concepts for Understanding Gender-Based Violence in Migration Contexts|doi= 10.1007/978-3-031-07929-0_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach maintains a critical stance against the fragmentation and essentialism in identity politics, aligning with Fineman's critiques but avoiding a universalist perspective that negates differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rodó-Zárate |first=Maria |date=2019-06-07 |title=Gender, Nation, and Situated Intersectionality: The Case of Catalan Pro-independence Feminism |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s1743923x19000035 |journal=Politics &amp; Gender |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=608–636 |doi=10.1017/s1743923x19000035 |issn=1743-923X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implementation within organizations ===
Practices referred to as intersectionality may be implemented in different ways in different organizations. Within the context of the UK charity sector, Christoffersen identified five different conceptualizations of intersectionality. "Generic intersectionality" was observed in policy areas, where intersectionality was conceptualized as developing policies to be in everyone's universal interest rather than being targeted to particular groups. "Pan equality" was concern for issues that affected most marginalised groups. "Multi-strand intersectionality" attempted to consider different groups when making a decision, but rarely viewed the groups as overlapping or focused on issues for a particular group. "Diversity within" considered one main form of identity, such as gender, as most important while occasionally considering other aspects of identity, with these different forms of identity sometimes seen as detracting from the main identity. "Intersections of equality strands" considered the intersection of identities but no form of identity was seen as more relevant. In this approach it was sometimes felt that if one dealt with the most marginalised identity the system would tend to work for all people. Christoffersen referred to some of these meanings given to intersectionality as "additive" where inequalities are thought to be able to be added to and subtracted from one another. .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Christoffersen |first=Ashlee |date=2021-10-01 |title=The politics of intersectional practice: competing concepts of intersectionality |url=https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/227507791/ChristoffersenA2021PPThePoliticsOfIntersectionalPractice.pdf |journal=Policy &amp; Politics |language=en |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=573–593 |doi=10.1332/030557321X16194316141034 |s2cid=236668880 |issn=1470-8442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Remediation ===
To provide sufficient preventive, redressive and deterrent remedies, judges in courts and others working in [[conflict resolution]] mechanisms take into account intersectional dimensions. &lt;ref name="Nissen 2023"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nissen |first=A. |title=Gender-Transformative Remedies for Women Human Rights Defenders |date=2023 |journal=Business and Human Rights Journal |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=381–384|doi=10.1017/bhj.2023.41 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-and-human-rights-journal/article/gendertransformative-remedies-for-women-human-rights-defenders/2A05A3CBAA5C62794AE194565813CD25 |hdl=1887/3716539 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Lisa Downing argues that intersectionality focuses too much on group identities, which can lead it to ignore the fact that people are individuals, not just members of a class. Ignoring this can cause intersectionality to lead to a simplistic analysis and inaccurate assumptions about how a person's values and attitudes are determined.&lt;ref name="Downing2018" /&gt;

Some conservatives and moderates believe that intersectionality allows people of color and women of color to victimize themselves and let themselves submit to special treatment. Instead, they classify the concept of intersectionality as a hierarchy of oppression determining who will receive better treatment than others. American conservative commentator [[Ben Shapiro]] stated in 2019 that "I would define intersectionality as, at least the way that I've seen it manifest on college campuses, and in a lot of the political left, as a hierarchy of victimhood in which people are considered members of a victim class by virtue of membership in a particular group, and at the intersection of various groups lies the ascent on the hierarchy".{{r|Coaston 2019}}

Barbara Tomlinson, of the Department of Feminist Studies at [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], has been critical of the applications of intersectional theory to attack other ways of feminist thinking.&lt;ref name="intersectionality993" /&gt;

Critics include Marxist historians and sociologists, some of whom claim that the contemporary applications of intersectional theory fail to adequately address economic class and wealth inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Reed, Jr. |first=Adolf |date=2020 |title=Socialism and the Argument against Race Reductionism |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1095796020913869?journalCode=nlfa |journal=New Labor Forum|volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=36–43 |doi=10.1177/1095796020913869 |s2cid=219429466 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Bellows |first=The |date=2020-06-15 |title=A Conversation With Walter Benn Michaels &amp; Adolph Reed Jr. |url=https://www.thebellows.org/walter-benn-michaels-adolph-reed-jr/ |access-date=2023-04-02 |website=The Bellows |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, philosopher [[Tommy J. Curry|Tommy Curry]] published several works charging intersectional feminism with implicitly adopting, and thereby perpetuating, harmful stereotypes of Black men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Tommy J.

Curry specifically points out how Crenshaw's intersectional model depends on second-wave feminist ideas imported from subculture of violence theorists who argue for a view of Black masculinity that is compensatory and sexually predatory. Curry also points out that Crenshaw's conclusions in Mapping the Margins rely on a dangerous gender essentialism that erases Black male victims of intimate partner violence, sexual assault, and lethal violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Curry |first=Tommy |title=The Man-Not: Race, Class, Genre, and the Dilemmas of Black Manhood |publisher=Temple University Press |year=2018 |isbn=978-1-4399-1486-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rekia Jibrin and Sara Salem argue that intersectional theory creates a unified idea of anti-oppression politics that requires a lot out of its adherents, often more than can reasonably be expected, creating difficulties achieving [[Praxis (process)|praxis]]. They also say that intersectional philosophy encourages a focus on the issues inside the group instead of on society at large, and that intersectionality is "a call to complexity and to abandon oversimplification... this has the parallel effect of emphasizing 'internal differences' over hegemonic structures".&lt;ref name="Jibrin 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Jibrin |first1=Rekia |last2=Salem |first2=Sara |date=2015 |title=Revisiting intersectionality: reflections on theory and praxis |url=https://cpb-us-e2.wpmucdn.com/sites.uci.edu/dist/f/1861/files/2014/10/2015_5_salem.pdf |journal=Trans-Scripts|volume=5 |issn=2160-6730}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{crossreference|See [[Hegemony]] and [[Cultural hegemony]].}})

Darren Hutchinson argues that "it is impossible to theorize about or study a group when each person in that group is 'composed of a complex and unique matrix of identities that shift in time, is never fixed, is constantly unstable and forever distinguishable from everyone else in the universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |title=Evidence-Based Best Practice for Discharge Planning: A Policy Review |publisher=University of St. Augustine for Health Sciences Library |first=Marissa |last=Lewis|year=2022 |doi=10.46409/sr.qbwh5074 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brittney Cooper]] approaches Crenshaw's original idea of intersectionality with more nuance. In Mary Hawkesworth and Lisa Disch's ''The Oxford Handbook of feminist theory'', Cooper points to Kimberlé Crenshaw's argument that the "failure to begin with an intersectional frame would always result in insufficient attention to black women's experiences of subordination." Cooper's main issue lies in the converse of Crenshaw's argument, where she feels that Crenshaw does not properly address intersectionality as a framework that is both "an effective tool of accounting for identities at any level beyond the structural," and a framework that would "fully and wholly account for the range or depth of black female experiences."&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Brittney (2016).

=== Methodology ===

[[Kathy Davis (sociologist)|Kathy Davis]] asserts that intersectionality is ambiguous and open-ended, and that its "lack of clear-cut definition or even specific parameters has enabled it to be drawn upon in nearly any context of inquiry".&lt;ref name="Davis 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davis |first1=Kathy |date=1 April 2008 |title=Intersectionality as buzzword: A sociology of science perspective on what makes a feminist theory successful |journal=Feminist Theory |volume=9 |pages=67–85 |doi=10.1177/1464700108086364 |s2cid=145295170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of quantitative studies seeking evidence on intersectional issues published through May 12, 2020 found that many quantitative methods were simplistic and were often misapplied or misinterpreted.&lt;ref name="Bauer2021" /&gt;

== Intersectionality and education ==
{{Essay-like|section|date=March 2023}}

=== Different methods of teaching/accessibility ===
Laura Gonzales and Janine Butler argue that intersectionality can be helpful to provide an open perspective that helps study multiple inclusive learning processes, formalities, and strategies in order to decrease the risk of academic disadvantages/inequity because of anyone's social, economic, or class level. Inclusivity in education is a direct product of intersectionality, as it takes into consideration elements of peoples' identity. Different, more inclusive styles of teaching have gained traction as teachers continue to work towards accessibility for a wider range of students, specifically those affected by disability. These teaching styles also embrace multilingualism, multimodality, and accessibility.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |title=CF 44: Multilingualism, Multimodality, and Accessibility by Laura Gonzales and Janine Butler |url=https://compositionforum.com/issue/44/multilingualism.php |access-date=2023-03-15 |website=compositionforum.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Laura Gonzales and Janine Butler explain in their article, when common language is unable to be reached, students may need to use other methods of communication such as gestures, visuals, or even technology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The research conducted on these students by both authors promote the strengths of bilingual education and disability in writing. Teachers in their classrooms also incorporate pedagogical methods for multimodal composition, which create safe and productive learning environments for students while also promoting intersectional methods of learning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

Both Gonzales and Butler incorporate their social justice movements for inclusion in their own classrooms.

Gonzales explains an introduction writing course to English majors where students were able to compile and film short videos of interviews with Indigenous people and interpreters. The purpose of the project served as a form of representation for an underrepresented group of people. In many instances, such as medical consultations, Indigenous people are not offered interpreters, even when they are supposed to.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Gonzales uses this course as an example and opportunity for community engagement where multiple forms of language were utilized, including digital media, readings, and conversations.

Another example is Butler's pedagogical approach to incorporating intersectionality, focusing on letting her disabled students communicate through a variation of assignments. Examples of these variations are video reflections or an analysis of digital spaces. The video reflections are more geared towards mindful interactions. The students first must consider their own environment and methods of communication and either work with individuals who use the same methods of communication or explore a new genre of communication from a different community. After, the student must create a multimodal and multilingual reflection of the interview in order to interpret and process their own experiences and takeaways.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Next is the analysis of digital spaces, where students must take into consideration how their publications or organizations properly reach their target audience. Students are able to use their own identities as inspiration for picking an organization/publication. Then, they must write an in-depth report on Medium (a social platform) on how the digital platform communicates with their audience, or doesn't.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If published, this creates "an online audience"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; where students and other peers can directly interact and discuss with one another.

Both of these examples are ways Gonzales and Butler incorporate their research into their own classrooms in order to engage with their communities and incorporate intersectionality. &amp;nbsp;

=== Writing programs on race and gender ===
Inclusion of intersectionality is meant to "Trouble the Boundaries" and pave the way for a more diverse writing program in Predominantly White Institutions (PWI). Writing programs are very closely linked by the influence of race and gender. Both of the authors Collin Lamout Craig and Staci Maree write about their experiences in writing program's as administrators in a predominantly white midwestern institution. One big culture shock to them was the underrepresentation of people of color and minorities in the Council of Writing Program Administrators (CWPA) meetings. The CWPA oversee the evolution of the program, introduce revisions, implement university writing standards etc. Therefore, reprogramming and the addressing of issues must first and foremost go through the CWPA.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Craig |first1=Collin Lamont |last2=Perryman-Clark |first2=Staci Maree |date=Spring 2011 |title=Troubling the Boundaries: (De)Constructing WPA Identities at the Intersections of Race and Gender |url=http://associationdatabase.co/archives/34n2/34n2craig-perryman-clark.pdf |journal=Council of Writing Program Administrators |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=37–58 |via=WPA Journal Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is not to say any of the council members are at fault, it is a mere observation to shed light on the issue at hand, power dynamics and how they affect writing programs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Dominant and minority relationships serve as a dimension that pushes for change in order to reach common language. Consequently, a broader composition in understanding helps construct identity politics in order to reach an agreement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Craig then goes on to share her story when a well known professor approaches her and takes on an "It's not my problem"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or "I can't teach these people"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; attitude when he has an issue with another black RA. The professor then goes on to say "He might take constructive criticism better from a pretty woman like you than an old white guy like me."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her example is one of many given in the article that address the issue at hand with power dynamics within writing programs and PWI's. It doesn't allow room for advice or consultation from those of other races or gender. Instead, it simply passes on one problem from one demographic to another.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In these cases taking into consideration intersectionality and how prevalent they are in academia can help set up a system of acknowledgment and understanding.

== Psychology ==
{{Main|Biases|Heuristics in judgment and decision-making}}

Researchers in psychology have incorporated intersection effects since the 1950s.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Samuelson |first1=William |last2=Zeckhauser |first2=Richard |date=1988-03-01 |title=Status quo bias in decision making |journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty |language=en |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=7–59 |doi=10.1007/BF00055564 |s2cid=5641133 |issn=1573-0476}}&lt;/ref&gt; These intersection effects were based on studying the lenses of biases, heuristics, stereotypes, and judgments. Psychologists have extended research in psychological biases to the areas of cognitive and motivational psychology. What is found, is that every human mind has its own biases in judgment and decision-making that tend to preserve the status quo by avoiding change and attention to ideas that exist outside one's personal realm of perception.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Psychological interaction effects span a range of variables, although person-by-situation effects are the most examined category. As a result, psychologists do not construe the interaction effect of demographics such as gender and race as either more noteworthy or less noteworthy than any other interaction effect. In addition, oppression can be regarded as a subjective construct when viewed as an absolute hierarchy.

Even if an objective definition of oppression was reached, person-by-situation effects would make it difficult to deem certain persons or categories of persons as uniformly oppressed. For instance, black men are stereotypically perceived as criminals, which makes it much more difficult for them to get hired for a job than a white man. However, gay black men are perceived as harmless, which increases their chances of getting employed and receiving bonuses, despite the fact that gay males are also socially disadvantaged. The stereotype of gay men as harmless helps black men transcend their reputation for criminality.&lt;ref name=Pedulla2014&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pedulla |first1=David S. |title=The Positive Consequences of Negative Stereotypes: Race, Sexual Orientation, and the Job Application Process |journal=Social Psychology Quarterly |date=March 2014 |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=75–94 |doi=10.1177/0190272513506229 |s2cid=144311164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several psychological studies have likewise shown that possessing multiple oppressed or marginalized identities has effects that are not necessarily additive, or even multiplicative, but rather, interactive in complex ways.&lt;ref name="Remedios 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Remedios |first1=Jessica D. |last2=Chasteen |first2=Alison L. |last3=Rule |first3=Nicholas O. |last4=Plaks |first4=Jason E. |title=Impressions at the intersection of ambiguous and obvious social categories: Does gay+Black=likable? |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |date=November 2011 |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=1312–1315 |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2011.05.015 |hdl=1807/33199 |hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fattoracci 2020"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fattoracci |first1=Elisa S.

One of the main issues that affects the research of intersectionality is the construct problem. Constructs are what scientists use to build blocks of understanding within their field of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Construct {{!}} Psychology, Measurement &amp; Testing {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/construct |access-date=2023-12-07 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important because it gives us something to measure. As mentioned previously, it is incredibly difficult to define oppression and, specifically, the feeling of being oppressed and ways that different kinds of oppression may interact as a construct.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Grabe |first=Shelly |date=2020 |title=Research Methods in the Study of Intersectionality in Psychology: Examples Informed by a Decade of Collaborative Work With Majority World Women's Grassroots Activism |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=11 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2020.494309 |pmid=33192755 |pmc=7658295 |issn=1664-1078 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; As psychology grows and changes its ability to define constructs, this research will likely improve.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Critical animal studies ==
{{Undue weight|section|date=July 2024}}
This intersectional perspective,{{Clarify |date=July 2024}} highlighting similarities between the different forms of oppression and their interlinked nature, is advocated for in [[critical animal studies]] and [[ecofeminist]] literature. Scholars in these related areas have extended the concept to include non-human animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Falcón |first=Sylvanna M. |title=Intersectionality, Global Patriarchy, and the Power of Feminist Performance |date=2023-07-11 |work=The Routledge International Handbook of Intersectionality Studies |pages=113–121 |place=London |publisher=Routledge |doi=10.4324/9781003089520-11 |isbn=978-1-003-08952-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Salter |first=Colin |date=2015-01-01 |title=The animal question and condition: intersectionality and Critical Animal Studies in the Asia-Pacific |url=https://ro.uow.edu.au/asj/vol4/iss1/2 |journal=Animal Studies Journal |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 |issn=2201-3008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How we treat nonhuman animals not only reflects the morals and values of society, but our treatment also has enormous effects on society. Our actions toward farmed animals, in particular, cause immense suffering and devastating impact.&lt;ref name="Fox 2024"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fox |first=Laura |date=2024 |title=The Intersectionality of Environmental Injustice, Other Societal Harms, and Farmed Animal Welfare |journal=Environmental Justice |language=en |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=101–109 |doi=10.1089/env.2021.0125 |issn=1939-4071|doi-access=free }}{{Creative Commons text attribution notice|cc=by4|from this source=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Attribution needed |date=July 2024}}

“It is past time to acknowledge the full harms that the unreformed practices of [animal] farming are inflicting.” With these words, penned by Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] acknowledged that industrialized animal agriculture inflicts injuries that are intersectional and require extensive and expeditious repair. Factory farming is not just an issue of animal welfare or rights; it is also an issue of [[environmental justice]], workers' rights, and public health.{{Attribution needed |date=July 2024}} The relationship of these harms to our treatment of animals makes clear that farmed animal welfare is critical to counter many of the environmental injustices disproportionately impacting marginalized communities and peoples.&lt;ref name="Fox 2024"/&gt;{{Attribution needed |date=July 2024}}

Violence towards animals and violence towards people are often seen in Psychology and [[evidence-based medicine]] as intersectional or interconnected problems, and as such, this phenomenon has been termed the link.{{Clarify |date=July 2024}} Violence towards animals is a strong predictor or precursor that the abuser may inflict violence on people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Jegatheesan |first1=Brinda |last2=Enders-Slegers |first2=Marie-Jose |last3=Ormerod |first3=Elizabeth |last4=Boyden |first4=Paula |date=May 2020 |title=Understanding the Link between Animal Cruelty and Family Violence: The Bioecological Systems Model |journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health |volume=17 |issue=9 |pages=3116 |doi=10.3390/ijerph17093116 |doi-access=free |issn=1661-7827 |pmc=7246522 |pmid=32365760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Magical law ==
Magical law theorists have integrated intersectionality into their analysis of anti-magicality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ettúf |first=Qútb |date=2024 |title=Magical Law |url=https://www.academia.edu/123845129 |journal=Academia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magical identity and practice, either legitimate or falsely alleged, intersect with gender and race, having historically impacted women, Jewish people, and enslaved Africans in unique ways. Women, for example, faced witchcraft accusations in a manner specific to the intersection of female and magical identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Swales |first1=J.
