&lt;!-- Simple definition and simple example --&gt;
'''Intersectionality''' is an [[Analytic frame|analytical framework]] for understanding how aspects of a person's [[Social identity|social and political identities]] combine to create different modes of [[discrimination]] and [[Social privilege|privilege]]. Intersectionality identifies multiple factors of advantage and disadvantage.&lt;ref name="Runyan"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Runyan |first1=Anne Sisson |title=What Is Intersectionality and Why Is It Important? |url=https://www.aaup.org/article/what-intersectionality-and-why-it-important |publisher=American Association of University Professors |date=November–December 2018 |magazine=Academe |volume=104 |issue=6 |issn=2162-5247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of these factors include [[gender]], [[caste]], [[sex]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[Social class|class]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[religion]], [[disability]], [[Human body weight|weight]], and [[Human physical appearance|physical appearance]].&lt;ref name="Tucker"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Tucker |first=Abigail |title=How Much is Being Attractive Worth? |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-much-is-being-attractive-worth-80414787/ |access-date=22 June 2020 |magazine=Smithsonian |date=November 2012 |issn=0037-7333}}&lt;/ref&gt; These intersecting and overlapping social identities may be both [[Empowerment|empowering]] and [[Oppression|oppressing]].&lt;ref name="Holley 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holley |first1=Lynn C. |last2=Mendoza |first2=Natasha S. |last3=Del-Colle |first3=Melissa M. |last4=Bernard |first4=Marquita Lynette |title=Heterosexism, racism, and mental illness discrimination: Experiences of people with mental health conditions and their families |journal=Journal of Gay &amp; Lesbian Social Services |date=2 April 2016 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=93–116 |doi=10.1080/10538720.2016.1155520 |s2cid=147454725}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zinn 1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zinn |first1=Maxine Baca |last2=Dill |first2=Bonnie Thornton |title=Theorizing Difference from Multiracial Feminism |journal=Feminist Studies |date=1996 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=321–331 |id={{ProQuest|233181156}} {{GALE|A18800342}} |doi=10.2307/3178416 |jstor=3178416 |url=https://philarchive.org/rec/ZINTDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Relationship to older concepts of feminism; who's included? --&gt;
Intersectionality broadens the scope of the [[First-wave feminism|first]] and [[Second-wave feminism|second]] [[waves of feminism]], which largely focused on the experiences of women who were [[White women|white]], [[Middle class|middle-class]] and [[cisgender]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=hooks |first=bell |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/886381091 |title=Ain't I a woman : Black women and feminism |date=2015 |isbn=978-1-138-82148-4 |edition=[Second edition] |location=New York |oclc=886381091}}&lt;/ref&gt; to include the different experiences of [[women of color]], [[Poverty and gender|poor women]], [[immigrant women]], and other groups. Intersectional feminism aims to separate itself from [[white feminism]] by acknowledging women's differing experiences and identities.&lt;ref name="IWDA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://iwda.org.au/what-does-intersectional-feminism-actually-mean/ |title=What Does Intersectional Feminsim Actually Mean? |date=11 May 2018 |publisher=International Women's Development Agency |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423154503/https://iwda.org.au/what-does-intersectional-feminism-actually-mean/ |archive-date=23 April 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Theory here--&gt;
The term ''intersectionality'' was coined by [[Kimberlé Crenshaw]] in 1989.{{r|Cooper 2016|p=385}} Intersectionality is a qualitative analytic framework developed in the late 20th century that identifies how interlocking systems of [[Power (social and political)|power]] affect those who are most [[Social exclusion|marginalized in society]].{{r|Cooper 2016}}{{Page range too broad|date=December 2021}} Activists use the framework to promote [[Social equity|social]] and [[political egalitarianism]].&lt;ref name="IWDA" /&gt; Intersectionality opposes analytical systems that treat each axis of oppression in isolation. In this framework, for instance, discrimination against [[black women]] cannot be explained as a simple combination of [[misogyny]] and [[racism]], but as something more complicated.&lt;ref name="Crenshaw 2016a"&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Crenshaw |first1=Kimberlé |title=The urgency of intersectionality |url=https://www.ted.com/talks/kimberle_crenshaw_the_urgency_of_intersectionality/transcript |conference=TEDWomen 2016 |date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intersectionality engages in similar themes as [[triple oppression]], which is the oppression associated with being a poor or immigrant woman of color. Intersectional analysis aligns very closely with [[Anarcha-feminism|anarcha-feminist]] power analysis frameworks.

&lt;!--Critics here--&gt;
Criticism includes the framework's tendency to reduce individuals to specific demographic factors,&lt;ref name=Downing2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Downing |first1=Lisa |title=The body politic: Gender, the right wing and 'identity category violations' |journal=French Cultural Studies |date=November 2018 |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=367–377 |doi=10.1177/0957155818791075 |s2cid=165115259 |url=http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/53670526/Downing_August_Pre_Pub_Body_politic_article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its use as an ideological tool against other [[feminist theories]].&lt;ref name="intersectionality993"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tomlinson |first=Barbara |title=To Tell the Truth and Not Get Trapped: Desire, Distance, and Intersectionality at the Scene of Argument |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=993–1017 |doi=10.1086/669571 |date=Summer 2013 |s2cid=144641071}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have characterized the framework as ambiguous and lacking defined goals. As it is based in [[standpoint theory]], critics say the focus on subjective experiences can lead to contradictions and the inability to identify common causes of oppression.

The concept of intersectionality was introduced to the field of legal studies by [[black feminist]] scholar [[Kimberlé Crenshaw]],&lt;ref name="Duran 2020"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Duran |first1=Antonio |last2=Jones |first2=Susan R. |editor1-last=Casey |editor1-first=Zachary A. |title=Encyclopedia of Critical Whiteness Studies in Education |date=2020 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-44483-6 |pages=310–320 |chapter=Intersectionality |doi=10.1163/9789004444836_041 |s2cid=242630915}}&lt;/ref&gt; who used the term in a pair of essays{{Which|date=November 2022}} published in 1989 and 1991.&lt;ref name="Cooper 2016"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=Brittney |editor1-last=Disch |editor1-first=Lisa |editor2-first=Mary |editor2-last=Hawkesworth |chapter=Intersectionality |title=The Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theory |year=2016 |pages=385–406 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-932858-1 |doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199328581.013.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the theory primarily began as an exploration of the oppression of [[black women]] within society and the ways in which they experience intersecting layers of different forms of oppression, the analysis has expanded to include many more aspects of social identity. Identities most commonly referenced in [[fourth-wave feminism]] include race, gender, sex, sexuality, class, ability, nationality, citizenship, religion, and body type. The term was not adopted widely by feminists until the 2000s and has only grown since that time.{{Citation needed|date=November 2022}}

Intersectionality originated in [[critical race studies]] and entails the interconnection of gender and race (Nash 2008).{{Citation not found|date=November 2022}} Intersectionality demonstrates a multifaced connection between race, gender, and other systems that work together to oppress while allowing privilege. Intersectionality is relative because it displays how race, gender, and other components operate as one to shape the experiences of others. Crenshaw used intersectionality to denote how race, class, gender, and other systems combine to shape the experiences of many by making room for privilege.{{r|Crenshaw 1991}} Crenshaw used intersectionality to display the disadvantages caused by intersecting systems creating structural, political, and representational aspects of violence against minorities in the workplace and society.{{r|Crenshaw 1991}} Crenshaw explained the dynamics that using gender, race, and other forms of power in politics and academics plays a big role in intersectionality.&lt;ref name="Cho, Crenshaw &amp; McCall 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cho |first1=Sumi |last2=Crenshaw |first2=Kimberlé Williams |last3=McCall |first3=Leslie |title=Toward a Field of Intersectionality Studies: Theory, Applications, and Praxis |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |date=June 2013 |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=785–810 |doi=10.1086/669608 |jstor=10.1086/669608 |s2cid=143982074 |url=https://via.library.depaul.edu/lawfacpubs/705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[DeGraffenreid v. General Motors]]'' (1976), Emma DeGraffenreid and four other black female auto workers alleged compound [[employment discrimination]] against black women as a result of [[General Motors]]' seniority-based system of [[layoff]]s. The courts weighed the allegations of race and gender discrimination separately, finding that the employment of African-American male factory workers disproved racial discrimination, and the employment of white female office workers disproved [[gender discrimination]]. The court declined to consider compound discrimination, and dismissed the case.&lt;ref name="HoSang"&gt;{{cite book |last1=HoSang |first1=Daniel M. |editor1-last=Burgett |editor1-first=Bruce |editor2-last=Hendler |editor2-first=Glenn |title=Keywords for American cultural studies |date=2020 |publisher=New York University Press |isbn=978-1-4798-6745-5 |pages=142–144 |edition=3rd |chapter=Intersectionality |doi=10.18574/9781479867455-038 |doi-broken-date=31 July 2022 |chapter-url=https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/intersectionality/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|Adewunmi}} Crenshaw argued that in cases such as this, the courts have tended to ignore black women's unique experiences by treating them as {{em|only}} women or {{em|only}} black.&lt;ref name="Coaston 2019"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Coaston |first1=Jane |title=The intersectionality wars |url=https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/5/20/18542843/intersectionality-conservatism-law-race-gender-discrimination |work=Vox |date=28 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|Crenshaw 1989|pp=141–143}}

The ideas behind intersectional feminism existed long before the term was coined. For example, [[Sojourner Truth]] exemplifies intersectionality in her 1851 "[[Ain't I a Woman?]]" speech, in which she spoke from her racialized position as a former slave to critique essentialist notions of [[femininity]].&lt;ref name="Brah"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brah |first1=Avtar |last2=Phoenix |first2=Ann |title=Ain't I A Woman?

Cooper|Anna Julia Cooper]] identifies black women as the most important actors in social change movements because of their experience with multiple facets of oppression.&lt;ref name="Cooper 1892"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=Anna Julia |orig-year=first published 1892 |chapter=The colored woman's office |editor-last=Lemert |editor-first=Charles |title=Social theory: the multicultural, global, and classic readings |publisher=Westview Press |location=Boulder, Colo. |edition=6th |isbn=978-0-8133-5044-8 |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patricia Hill Collins]] has located the origins of intersectionality among black feminists, [[Chicana feminism|Chicana]] and other Latina feminists, [[indigenous feminists]] and Asian American feminists between the 1960s and 1980s. Collins has noted the existence of intellectuals at other times and in other places who discussed similar ideas about the interaction of different forms of inequality, such as [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] and the [[cultural studies]] movement, [[Nira Yuval-Davis]], Anna Julia Cooper and [[Ida B. Wells]]. She noted that, as [[second-wave feminism]] receded in the 1980s, feminists of color such as [[Audre Lorde]], [[Gloria E. Anzaldúa]] and [[Angela Davis]] entered academic environments and brought their perspectives to their scholarship. During this decade, many of the ideas that would together be labeled as intersectionality coalesced in U.S. academia under the banner of "race, class and gender studies".&lt;ref name="Collins 2015" /&gt;

As articulated by author [[bell hooks]], &lt;!-- no, that's how she styles herself like e e cummings --&gt; the emergence of intersectionality "challenged the notion that 'gender' was the primary factor determining a woman's fate".&lt;ref name="hooks 2014"&gt;{{cite book |last=hooks |first=bell |title=Feminist Theory: from margin to center |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2014 |orig-year=first published 1984 |edition=3rd |isbn=978-1-138-82166-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical exclusion of black women from the feminist movement in the United States resulted in many black 19th- and 20th-century feminists, such as Anna Julia Cooper, challenging their historical exclusion. This disputed the ideas of earlier feminist movements, which were primarily led by white middle-class women, suggesting that women were a homogeneous category who shared the same life experiences.&lt;ref name="Davis 1983"&gt;{{cite book |last=Davis |first=Angela Y. |author-link=Angela Davis |title=Women, Race &amp; Class |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-394-71351-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once established that the forms of oppression experienced by white middle-class women were different from those experienced by black, poor, or disabled women, feminists began seeking ways to understand how gender, race, and class combine to "determine the female destiny".&lt;ref name="hooks 2014" /&gt;

The concept of intersectionality is intended to illuminate dynamics that have often been overlooked by feminist theory and movements.&lt;ref name="Thompson 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thompson |first1=Becky |title=Multiracial Feminism: Recasting the Chronology of Second Wave Feminism |journal=Feminist Studies |date=2002 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=337–360 |doi=10.2307/3178747 |jstor=3178747 |s2cid=152165042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racial inequality was a factor that was largely ignored by first-wave feminism, which was primarily concerned with gaining political equality between white men and white women. Early women's rights movements often exclusively pertained to the membership, concerns, and struggles of white women.&lt;ref name="Fixmer-Oraiz"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Gendered Lives: Communication, Gender, &amp; Culture |last1=Fixmer-Oraiz |last2=Wood |first1=Natalie |first2=Julia |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-305-28027-4 |location=Boston, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|59–60}} Second-wave feminism worked to dismantle sexism relating to the perceived domestic purpose of women. While feminists during this time achieved success in the United States through the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], [[Title IX]], and ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', they largely alienated black women from platforms in the mainstream movement.&lt;ref name="Grady"&gt;{{cite web |title=The waves of feminism, and why people keep fighting over them, explained |last=Grady |first=Constance |date=20 March 2018 |website=Vox |url=https://www.vox.com/2018/3/20/16955588/feminism-waves-explained-first-second-third-fourth |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190405172242/https://www.vox.com/2018/3/20/16955588/feminism-waves-explained-first-second-third-fourth |archive-date=5 April 2019 |url-status=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[third-wave feminism]]—which emerged shortly after the term ''intersectionality'' was coined in the late 1980s—noted the lack of attention to race, class, sexual orientation, and gender identity in early feminist movements, and tried to provide a channel to address political and social disparities.{{r|Fixmer-Oraiz|pp=72–73}} Intersectionality recognizes these issues which were ignored by early social justice movements. Many recent academics, such as [[Leslie McCall]], have argued that the introduction of the intersectionality theory was vital to sociology and that before the development of the theory, there was little research that specifically addressed the experiences of people who are subjected to multiple forms of oppression within society.&lt;ref name=McCall2005&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCall |first1=Leslie |title=The Complexity of Intersectionality |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |date=March 2005 |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=1771–1800 |doi=10.1086/426800 |jstor=10.1086/426800 |hdl=20.500.12209/1062 |s2cid=16690122}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this idea was championed by [[Iris Marion Young]], arguing that differences must be acknowledged in order to find unifying social justice issues that create coalitions that aid in changing society for the better.&lt;ref name="Carastathis"&gt;{{Cite book |jstor=j.ctt1fzhfz8 |title=Intersectionality: Origins, Contestations, Horizons |last=Carastathis |first=Anna |date=2016 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |doi=10.2307/j.ctt1fzhfz8 |isbn=978-0-8032-8555-2 |editor-last1=Leong |editor-first1=Karen J. |editor-last2=Smith |editor-first2=Andrea}}{{Page needed|date=November 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, this relates to the ideals of the [[National Council of Negro Women]] (NCNW).&lt;ref name="Mueller 1954"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mueller |first1=Ruth Caston |title=The National Council of Negro Women, Inc. |journal=Negro History Bulletin |date=1954 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=27–31 |jstor=44175227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also has historical and theoretical links to the concept of simultaneity, which was advanced during the 1970s by members of the [[Combahee River Collective]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="Wiegman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wiegman |first=Robyn |year=2012 |chapter=Critical kinship (universal aspirations and intersectional judgements) |editor-last=Wiegman |editor-first=Robyn |title=Object lessons |page=244 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham, N.C. |isbn=978-0-8223-5160-3 |doi=10.1515/9780822394945 |s2cid=242615176 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/objectlessons00wieg/page/244/mode/1up |chapter-url-access=registration |url-status=unfit}} {{block indent |left=2 |Citing: {{cite book |last1=Hull |first1=Gloria T. |last2=Bell-Scott |first2=Patricia |last3=Smith |first3=Barbara |title=All the women are White, all the blacks are men, but some of us are brave: black women's studies |publisher=[[Feminist Press]] |location=Old Westbury, N.Y. |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-912670-92-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/allwomenarewhite00hull/mode/1up |url-access=registration}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneity is the simultaneous influences of race, class, gender, and sexuality, which informed the member's lives and their resistance to oppression.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Amanda Walker |title=Resituating the Crossroads: Theoretical Innovations in Black Feminist Ethnography |journal=Souls |date=2 October 2017 |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=401–415 |doi=10.1080/10999949.2018.1434350 |s2cid=149590053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the women of the Combahee River Collective advanced an understanding of African-American experiences that challenged analyses emerging from black and male-centered social movements, as well as those from mainstream cisgender, white, middle-class, heterosexual feminists.&lt;ref name="Norman 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Norman |first=Brian |title='We' in Redux: The Combahee River Collective's ''black Feminist Statement'' |journal=[[Differences (journal)|differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies]] |volume=18 |issue=2 |page=104 |doi=10.1215/10407391-2007-004 |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Black women leading the way.jpg|thumb|A crowd of people in a [[Black Lives Matter]] protest in 2015. The main focus is four black women, one holding a sign.]]
Since the term was coined, many feminist scholars have emerged with historical support for the intersectional theory. These women include [[Beverly Guy-Sheftall]] and her fellow contributors to ''Words of Fire: An Anthology of African-American Feminist Thought'', a collection of articles describing the multiple oppressions black women in America have experienced from the 1830s to contemporary times. Guy-Sheftall speaks about the constant premises that influence the lives of African-American women, saying, "black women experience a special kind of oppression and suffering in this country which is racist, sexist, and classist because of their dual race and gender identity and their limited access to economic resources."&lt;ref name="Guy-Sheftall"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Guy-Sheftall |first=Beverly |title=Words of fire : an anthology of African-American feminist thought |date=1995 |publisher=New Press |isbn=978-1-56584-256-4 |location=New York |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781565842564/mode/1up |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers and theorists were using intersectional analysis in their work before the term was coined. For example, Deborah K. King published the article "Multiple Jeopardy, Multiple Consciousness: The Context of a Black Feminist Ideology" in 1988, just before Crenshaw coined the term ''intersectionality''. In the article, King addresses what soon became the foundation for intersectionality, saying, "black women have long recognized the special circumstances of our lives in the United States: the commonalities that we share with all women, as well as the bonds that connect us to the men of our race."&lt;ref name=King1988/&gt; Additionally, [[Gloria Wekker]] describes how [[Gloria E. Anzaldúa|Gloria Anzaldúa]]'s work as a [[Chicana feminism|Chicana]] feminist theorist exemplifies how "existent categories for identity are strikingly not dealt with in separate or mutually exclusive terms, but are always referred to in relation to one another".&lt;ref name="Buikema 2009"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Doing Gender in Media, Art and Culture: A Comprehensive Guide to Gender Studies |editor1=Buikema, Rosemarie |editor2=van der Tuin, Iris |publisher=Routeledge |location=London |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-415-49383-3 |pages=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wekker also points to the words and activism of [[Sojourner Truth]] as an example of an intersectional approach to social justice.&lt;ref name="Buikema 2009" /&gt; In her speech, "[[Ain't I a Woman?]]", Truth identifies the difference between the oppression of white and black women. She says that white women are often treated as emotional and delicate, while black women are subjected to racist abuse. However, this was largely dismissed by white feminists who worried that this would distract from their goal of women's suffrage and instead focused their attention on emancipation.&lt;ref name="Truth"&gt;{{cite book |last=Truth |first=Sojourner |chapter='Speech at the Woman's Rights Convention, Akron, Ohio' (1851) |title=Available Means: An Anthology Of Women's Rhetoric(s) |pages=144–146 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |isbn=978-0-8229-7975-3 |doi=10.2307/j.ctt5hjqnj.28 |jstor=j.ctt5hjqnj.28 |year=2001 |editor1-first=Joy |editor1-last=Ritchie |editor2-first=Kate |editor2-last=Ronald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, [[Kimberlé Crenshaw]] coined the term ''intersectionality'' as a way to help explain the oppression of [[African-American women]] in her essay "Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A black Feminist Critique of Anti-discrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics".&lt;ref name="Crenshaw 1989"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crenshaw |first1=Kimberlé |title=Demarginalizing the intersection of race and sex: a black feminist critique of antidiscrimination doctrine, feminist theory and antiracist politics |journal=University of Chicago Legal Forum |date=1989 |volume=1989 |issue=1 |pages=139–167 |url=http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/uclf/vol1989/iss1/8 |issn=0892-5593}} [https://archive.org/details/DemarginalizingTheIntersectionOfRaceAndSexABlackFeminis/mode/1up?view=theater Full text at Archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Crenshaw's term is now{{When|date=November 2021}} at the forefront of national conversations about racial justice, [[identity politics]], and policing—and over the years has helped shape legal discussions.&lt;ref name="Two Decades"&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--anonymous author; no byline--&gt; |title=Kimberlé Crenshaw on Intersectionality, More than Two Decades Later |date=8 June 2017 |publisher=Columbia Law School |url=https://www.law.columbia.edu/news/archive/kimberle-crenshaw-intersectionality-more-two-decades-later |access-date=14 May 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adewunmi"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Adewunmi |first=Bim |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/lifestyle/2014/04/kimberl-crenshaw-intersectionality-i-wanted-come-everyday-metaphor-anyone-could |title=Kimberlé Crenshaw on intersectionality: 'I wanted to come up with an everyday metaphor that anyone could use' |date=2 April 2014 |work=[[New Statesman]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180518120135/https://www.newstatesman.com/lifestyle/2014/04/kimberl-crenshaw-intersectionality-i-wanted-come-everyday-metaphor-anyone-could |archive-date=18 May 2018 |url-status= |url-access=limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her work, Crenshaw discusses [[Black feminism]], arguing that the experience of being a black woman cannot be understood in terms independent of either being black or a woman. Rather, it must include interactions between the two identities, which, she adds, should frequently reinforce one another.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2004"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thomas |first1=Sheila |last2=Crenshaw |first2=Kimberlé |title=Intersectionality: the double bind of race and gender |work=Perspectives Magazine |date=Spring 2004 |page=2 |publisher=[[American Bar Association]] |url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/perspectives_magazine/women_perspectives_Spring2004CrenshawPSP.authcheckdam.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118111551/http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/perspectives_magazine/women_perspectives_Spring2004CrenshawPSP.authcheckdam.pdf |archive-date=18 January 2012 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to show that non-white women have a vastly different experience from white women due to their race and/or class and that their experiences are not easily voiced or amplified, Crenshaw explores two types of male violence against women: [[domestic violence]] and [[rape]]. Through her analysis of these two forms of male violence against women, Crenshaw says that the experiences of non-white women consist of a combination of both racism and sexism.&lt;ref name="Crenshaw 1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crenshaw |first1=Kimberle |title=Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color |journal=Stanford Law Review |date=July 1991 |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=1241–1299 |doi=10.2307/1229039 |jstor=1229039 |citeseerx=10.1.1.695.5934}} {{block indent |left=2 |Reprinted in: {{cite book |editor1-last=Crenshaw |editor1-first=Kimberlé |editor2-last=Gotanda |editor2-first=Neil |editor3-last=Peller |editor3-first=Gary |editor4-last=Thomas |editor4-first=Kendall |title=Critical Race Theory: The Key Writings that Formed the Movement |year=1995 |location=New York |publisher=The New Press |isbn=978-1-56584-271-7 |pages=357–384 |url=https://archive.org/details/critica_xxx_1995_00_1144/page/357/mode/1up?view=theater |url-access=registration}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; She says that because non-white women are present within discourses that have been designed to address either race or sex—but not both at the same time—non-white women are marginalized within both of these systems of oppression as a result.&lt;ref name="Crenshaw 1991" /&gt;

In her work, Crenshaw identifies three aspects of intersectionality that affect the visibility of non-white women: structural intersectionality, political intersectionality, and representational intersectionality. Structural intersectionality deals with how non-white women experience domestic violence and rape in a manner qualitatively different than that of white women. Political intersectionality examines how laws and policies intended to increase equality have paradoxically decreased the visibility of violence against non-white women. Finally, representational intersectionality delves into how [[Popular culture|pop culture]] portrayals of non-white women can obscure their own authentic lived experiences.&lt;ref name="Crenshaw 1991" /&gt;

The term gained prominence in the 1990s, particularly in the wake of the further development of Crenshaw's work in the writings of sociologist Patricia Hill Collins. Crenshaw's term, Collins says, replaced her own previous coinage "black feminist thought", and "increased the general applicability of her theory from African American women to all women".&lt;ref name="Mann 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Mann |first1=Susan A. |last2=Huffman |first2=Douglas J. |title=The decentering of second wave feminism and the rise of the third wave |journal=[[Science &amp; Society]] |volume=69 |issue=1 |pages=56–91 |jstor=40404229 |date=January 2005 |doi=10.1521/siso.69.1.56.56799}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}} Much like Crenshaw, Collins argues that cultural patterns of oppression are not only interrelated, but are bound together and influenced by the intersectional systems of society, such as race, gender, class, and ethnicity.{{r|Collins 2000b|p=42}} Collins describes this as "interlocking social institutions [that] have relied on multiple forms of segregation... to produce unjust results".&lt;ref name="Collins 2000a"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Collins |first1=Patricia Hill |title=Black feminist thought : knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment |date=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-92484-9 |page=277 |edition=2nd |url=https://archive.org/details/blackfeministtho0000coll/page/277/mode/1up?view=theater |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins sought to create frameworks to think about intersectionality, rather than expanding on the theory itself. She identified three main branches of study within intersectionality. One branch deals with the background, ideas, issues, conflicts, and debates within intersectionality. Another branch seeks to apply intersectionality as an analytical strategy to various [[social institutions]] in order to examine how they might perpetuate social inequality. The final branch formulates intersectionality as a critical praxis to determine how [[social justice]] initiatives can use intersectionality to bring about social change.&lt;ref name="Collins 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Collins |first=Patricia Hill |title=Intersectionality's definitional dilemmas |journal=[[Annual Review of Sociology]] |volume=41 |pages=1–20 |doi=10.1146/annurev-soc-073014-112142 |date=2015 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One writer who focused on intersectionality was [[Audre Lorde]], who was a self-proclaimed "Black, Lesbian, Mother, Warrior, Poet".&lt;ref name="Audre Lorde"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/audre-lorde |title=Audre Lorde |publisher=Poetry Foundation |location=Chicago |access-date=15 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the title she gave herself, Lorde expressed her multifaceted personhood and demonstrated her intersectional struggles with being a black, gay woman. Lorde commented in her essay ''The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house'', that she was living in "a country where racism, sexism, and homophobia are inseparable".&lt;ref name="Lorde 1984"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lorde |first=Audre |chapter=The Master’s Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master’s House |orig-year=first published 1984 |title=Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches |location=Berkeley, Calif. |publisher=Crossing Press |pages=110–114 |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-5809-1186-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, Lorde outlines the importance of intersectionality, while acknowledging that different prejudices are inherently linked.&lt;ref name="Nixon"&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Nixon |first1=Angelique V. |url=http://www.thefeministwire.com/2014/02/the-magic-and-fury-of-audre-lorde-feminist-praxis-and-pedagogy/ |title=The Magic and Fury of Audre Lorde: Feminist Praxis and Pedagogy |date=February 24, 2014 |work=The Feminist Wire |archive-date=October 29, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029064926/http://www.thefeministwire.com/2014/02/the-magic-and-fury-of-audre-lorde-feminist-praxis-and-pedagogy/ |url-status=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorde's formulation of this linkage remains seminal in intersectional feminism.&lt;ref name="Nixon" /&gt;{{efn|For examples, see: {{bulleted list|Nash, Jennifer C.

Though intersectionality began with the exploration of the interplay between gender and race, over time other identities and oppressions were added to the theory. For example, in 1981 [[Cherríe Moraga]] and [[Gloria Anzaldúa]] published the first edition of ''[[This Bridge Called My Back]]''. This anthology explored how classifications of sexual orientation and class also mix with those of race and gender to create even more distinct political categories. Many black, Latina, and Asian writers featured in the collection stress how their sexuality interacts with their race and gender to inform their perspectives. Similarly, poor women of color detail how their socio-economic status adds a layer of nuance to their identities, ignored or misunderstood by middle-class white feminists.&lt;ref name="Moraga"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Moraga |editor1-first=Cherríe |editor2-last=Anzaldúa |editor2-first=Gloria |title=This bridge called my back: writings by radical women of color |date=1983 |publisher=Kitchen Table; Women of Color Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-913175-03-3 |edition=2nd |url=https://archive.org/details/thisbridgecalled00mora/mode/1up?view=theater |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2022}}

According to black feminists, experiences of class, gender, and sexuality cannot be adequately understood unless the influence of racialization is carefully considered. This focus on racialization was highlighted many times by scholar and feminist [[bell hooks]], specifically in her 1981 book ''[[Ain't I a Woman? (book)|Ain't I A Woman: Black Women and Feminism]]''.&lt;ref name="hooks 1981"&gt;{{cite book |last1=hooks |first1=bell |title=Ain't I a woman: Black women and feminism |date=1981 |publisher=South End Press |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-89608-128-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/aintiwoman00bell/mode/1up?view=theater |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2022}} Feminists argue that an understanding of intersectionality is a vital element of gaining political and social equality and improving our democratic system.&lt;ref name="Hutchinson 2011"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hutchinson, Janet R. |chapter=Feminist theories and their application to public administration |editor-last1=D'Agostino |editor-first1=Maria |editor-last2=Levine |editor-first2=Helisse |title=Women in Public Administration: theory and practice |page=8 |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |location=Sudbury, Mass. |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-7637-7725-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collins's theory represents the sociological crossroads between [[second-wave feminism|modern]] and [[Post-modern feminism|post-modern feminist thought]].&lt;ref name="Collins 2000b"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Collins |first=Patricia Hill |title=Gender, black feminism, and black political economy |journal=[[Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]] |volume=568 |issue=1 |pages=41–53 |doi=10.1177/000271620056800105 |date=March 2000 |s2cid=146255922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chiara Bottici]] has argued that criticisms of intersectionality that find it to be incomplete, or argue that it fails to recognise the specificity of women's oppression, can be met with an [[anarcha-feminism]] that recognises "that there is something ''specific'' about the oppression of women and that in order to fight it you have to fight ''all'' other forms of oppression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bottici |first=Chiara |author-link=Chiara Bottici |title=Bodies in Plural: Towards an Anarcha-feminist Manifesto |journal=[[Thesis Eleven]] |volume=142 |issue=1 |year=2017 |page=95 |doi=10.1177/0725513617727793 |s2cid=148911963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxist feminist critical theory===
{{Marxism}}
[[W. E. B. Du Bois]] theorized that the intersectional paradigms of race, class, and nation might explain specific aspects of the black political economy. Collins writes: "Du Bois saw race, class, and nation not primarily as personal identity categories but as social hierarchies that shaped African-American access to status, poverty, and power."{{r|Collins 2000b|p=44}} Du Bois omitted gender from his theory and considered it more of a personal identity category.

[[Cheryl Townsend Gilkes]] expands on this by pointing out the value of centering on the experiences of black women. Joy James takes things one step further by "using paradigms of intersectionality in interpreting social phenomena". Collins later integrated these three views by examining a black political economy through the centering of black women's experiences and the use of a theoretical framework of intersectionality.{{r|Collins 2000b|p=44}}

Collins uses a [[Marxist feminist]] approach and applies her intersectional principles to what she calls the "work/family nexus and black women's poverty". In her 2000 article "Black Political Economy" she describes how, in her view, the intersections of [[consumer racism]], gender hierarchies, and disadvantages in the labor market can be centered on black women's unique experiences. Considering this from a historical perspective and examining interracial marriage laws and property inheritance laws creates what Collins terms a "distinctive work/family nexus that in turn influences the overall patterns of black political economy".{{r|Collins 2000b|pp=45–46}} For example, [[anti-miscegenation laws]] effectively suppressed the upward economic mobility of black women.

The intersectionality of race and gender has been shown to have a visible impact on the labor market. "Sociological research clearly shows that accounting for education, experience, and skill does not fully explain significant differences in labor market outcomes."&lt;ref name="Browne &amp; Misra 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Browne |first1=Irene |last2=Misra |first2=Joya |title=The Intersection of Gender and Race in the Labor Market |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |date=August 2003 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=487–513 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100016 |jstor=30036977}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|506}} The three main domains in which we see the impact of intersectionality are wages, discrimination, and domestic labor. Those who experience privilege within the social hierarchy in terms of race, gender, and socio-economic status are less likely to receive lower wages, to be subjected to stereotypes and discriminated against, or to be hired for exploitative domestic positions. Studies of the labor market and intersectionality provide a better understanding of economic inequalities and the implications of the multidimensional impact of race and gender on social status within society.&lt;ref name="Browne &amp; Misra 2003"/&gt;{{rp|506–507}}

==Forms: structural, political, representational==
Kimberlé Crenshaw, in "Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence Against Women of Color",&lt;ref name="Crenshaw 1991"/&gt; uses and explains three different forms of intersectionality to describe the violence that women experience. According to Crenshaw, there are three forms of intersectionality: structural, political, and representational intersectionality.

Structural intersectionality is used to describe how different structures work together and create a complex which highlights the differences in the experiences of women of color with domestic violence and rape. Structural intersectionality entails the ways in which classism, sexism, and racism interlock and oppress women of color while molding their experiences in different arenas. Crenshaw's analysis of structural intersectionality was used during her field study of battered women. In this study, Crenshaw uses intersectionality to display the multilayered oppressions that women who are victims of domestic violence face.&lt;ref name=Pedulla2014/&gt;

Political intersectionality highlights two conflicting systems in the political arena, which separates women and women of color into two subordinate groups.&lt;ref name=Pedulla2014/&gt; The experiences of women of color differ from those of white women and men of color due to their race and gender often intersecting. White women suffer from gender bias, and men of color suffer from racial bias; however, both of their experiences differ from that of women of color, because women of color experience both racial and gender bias. According to Crenshaw, a political failure of the antiracist and feminist discourses was the exclusion of the intersection of race and gender that places priority on the interest of "people of color" and "women", thus disregarding one while highlighting the other. Political engagement should reflect support of women of color; a prime example of the exclusion of women of color that shows the difference in the experiences of white women and women of color is the women's suffrage march.&lt;ref name=King1988&gt;{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=Deborah K. |title=Multiple Jeopardy, Multiple Consciousness: The Context of a Black Feminist Ideology |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |date=1 October 1988 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=42–72 |doi=10.1086/494491 |s2cid=143446946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representational intersectionality advocates for the creation of imagery that is supportive of women of color. Representational intersectionality condemns sexist and racist marginalization of women of color in representation. Representational intersectionality also highlights the importance of women of color having representation in media and contemporary settings.

==Key concepts==
===Interlocking matrix of oppression===
Collins refers to the various intersections of social inequality as the [[matrix of domination]]. These are also known as "vectors of oppression and privilege".&lt;ref name="Ritzer 2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ritzer |first1=George |author1-link=George Ritzer |last2=Stepinisky |first2=Jeffrey |title=Contemporary sociological theory and its classical roots: the basics |pages=204–207 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |edition=4th |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-07-802678-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|204}} These terms refer to how differences among people (sexual orientation, class, race, age, etc.) serve as oppressive measures towards women and change the experience of living as a woman in society. Collins, [[Audre Lorde]] (in ''[[Sister Outsider]]''), and [[bell hooks]] point towards either/or thinking as an influence on this oppression and as further intensifying these differences.&lt;ref name="Dudley 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dudley |first=Rachel A. |title=Confronting the concept of intersectionality: the legacy of Audre Lorde and contemporary feminist organizations |journal=McNair Scholars Journal |volume=10 |issue=1 |page=5 |date=2006 |url=https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/mcnair/vol10/iss1/5/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201081159/https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/mcnair/vol10/iss1/5/ |archive-date=1 December 2017 |url-status=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Collins refers to this as the construct of dichotomous oppositional difference. This construct is characterized by its focus on differences rather than similarities.&lt;ref name="Collins 1986"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=Patricia Hill |title=Learning from the Outsider Within: The Sociological Significance of Black Feminist Thought |journal=Social Problems |date=October 1986 |volume=33 |issue=6 |pages=S14–S32 |doi=10.2307/800672 |jstor=800672 |s2cid=144491582}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|S20}} Lisa A. Flores suggests, when individuals live in the borders, they "find themselves with a foot in both worlds". The result is "the sense of being neither" exclusively one identity nor another.&lt;ref name="Flores 1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Flores |first1=Lisa A. |title=Creating discursive space through a rhetoric of difference: Chicana feminists craft a homeland |journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech |date=May 1996 |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=142–156 |doi=10.1080/00335639609384147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standpoint epistemology and the outsider within===
Both Collins and [[Dorothy E. Smith|Dorothy Smith]] have been instrumental in providing a sociological definition of [[standpoint theory]]. A standpoint is an individual's world perspective. The theoretical basis of this approach views societal knowledge as being located within an individual's specific geographic location. In turn, knowledge becomes distinct and subjective; it varies depending on the social conditions under which it was produced.&lt;ref name="Mann 1997"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Mann |first1=Susan A. |last2=Kelley |first2=Lori R. |title=Standing at the crossroads of modernist thought: Collins, Smith, and the new feminist epistemologies |journal=[[Gender &amp; Society]] |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=391–408 |doi=10.1177/089124397011004002 |date=August 1997 |s2cid=55757598}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|392}}

The concept of the outsider within refers to a standpoint encompassing the [[Self (sociology)|self]], family, and society.&lt;ref name="Collins 1986"/&gt;{{rp|S14}} This relates to the specific experiences to which people are subjected as they move from a common cultural world (i.e., family) to that of modern society.&lt;ref name="Ritzer 2013" /&gt;{{rp|207}} Therefore, even though a woman—especially a Black woman—may become influential in a particular field, she may feel as though she does not belong. Her personality, behavior, and cultural being overshadow her value as an individual; thus, she becomes the outsider within.&lt;ref name="Collins 1986"/&gt;{{rp|S14}}

===Resisting oppression===
Speaking from a [[critical theory|critical]] standpoint, Collins points out that Brittan and Maynard say that "domination always involves the [[objectification]] of the dominated; all forms of oppression imply the devaluation of the subjectivity of the oppressed".&lt;ref name="Collins 1986"/&gt;{{rp|S18}} She later notes that self-valuation and self-definition are two ways of resisting oppression, and claims the practice of [[self-awareness]] helps to preserve the self-esteem of the group that is being oppressed while allowing them to avoid any [[Dehumanization|dehumanizing]] outside influences.

Marginalized groups often gain a status of being an "other".&lt;ref name="Collins 1986"/&gt;{{rp|S18}} In essence, you are "an other" if you are different from what [[Audre Lorde]] calls the mythical [[Normality (behaviour)|norm]]. [[Gloria Anzaldúa]], scholar of Chicana cultural theory, theorized that the sociological term for this is "[[othering]]", i.e. specifically attempting to establish a person as unacceptable based on a certain, unachieved criterion.&lt;ref name="Ritzer 2013" /&gt;{{rp|205}}

Additionally, applications with regard to property and wealth can be traced to the American historical narrative that is filled "with tensions and struggles over property—in its various forms.

===Intersectionality in a global context===
[[file:Dyke*Line auf dem Jungfernstieg und neuen Jungfernstieg und auf Booten auf der Binnenalster 002.jpg|thumb|Intersectionality at a Dyke March in Hamburg, Germany, 2020]]
Over the last couple of decades in the [[European Union]] (EU), there has been discussion regarding the intersections of social classifications. Before Crenshaw coined her definition of intersectionality, there was a debate on what these societal categories were. The once definite borders between the categories of gender, race, and class have instead fused into a multidimensional intersection of "race" that now includes religion, sexuality, ethnicities, etc. In the EU and UK, these intersections are referred to as the notion of "multiple discrimination". Although the EU passed a non-discrimination law which addresses these multiple intersections; there is however debate on whether the law is still proactively focusing on the proper inequalities.&lt;ref name="Schiek 2011"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schiek |first1=Dagmar |last2=Lawson |first2=Anna |title=European Union Non-discrimination Law and Intersectionality: Investigating the Triangle of Racial, Gender and Disability Discrimination |date=2011 |publisher=Ashgate |isbn=978-0-7546-7980-6}}{{page needed|date=July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the EU, intersectional categories have also been considered. In ''Analyzing Gender, Intersectionality, and Multiple Inequalities: Global, Transnational and Local Contexts'', the authors argue: "The impact of patriarchy and traditional assumptions about gender and families are evident in the lives of Chinese migrant workers (Chow, Tong), sex workers and their clients in South Korea (Shin), and Indian widows (Chauhan), but also Ukrainian migrants (Amelina) and Australian men of the new global middle class (Connell)." This text suggests that there are many more intersections of discrimination for people around the globe than Crenshaw originally accounted for in her definition.&lt;ref name="Chow 2011"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chow |first1=Esther Ngan-Ling |last2=Segal |first2=Marcia Texler |last3=Lin |first3=Tan |title=Analyzing Gender, Intersectionality, and Multiple Inequalities: Global-transnational and Local Contexts |date=2011 |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing |isbn=978-0-85724-744-5}}{{page needed|date=March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chandra Mohanty discusses alliances between women throughout the world as intersectionality in a global context. She rejects the western feminist theory, especially when it writes about global women of color and generally associated "third world women". She argues that "third world women" are often thought of as a homogenous entity, when, in fact, their experience of oppression is informed by their geography, history, and culture. When western feminists write about women in the global South in this way, they dismiss the inherent intersecting identities that are present in the dynamic of feminism in the global South. Mohanty questions the performance of intersectionality and relationality of power structures within the US and colonialism and how to work across identities with this history of colonial power structures.&lt;ref name="Mohanty 1984"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mohanty |first1=Chandra Talpade |title=Under Western Eyes: Feminist Scholarship and Colonial Discourses |journal=Boundary 2 |date=1984 |volume=12/13 |pages=333–358 |id={{INIST|11910852}} |doi=10.2307/302821 |jstor=302821}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of homogeneity and intersecting identities can be seen through [[feminism in India]], which goes over how women in India practice feminism within social structures and the continuing effects of colonization that differ from that of Western and other non-Western countries.

This is elaborated on by Christine Bose, who discusses a global use of intersectionality which works to remove associations of specific inequalities with specific institutions while showing that these systems generate intersectional effects. She uses this approach to develop a framework that can analyze gender inequalities across different nations and differentiates this from an approach (the one that Mohanty was referring to) which, one, paints national-level inequalities as the same and, two, differentiates only between the global North and South. This is manifested through the intersection of global dynamics like economics, migration, or violence, with regional dynamics, like histories of the nation or gendered inequalities in education and property education.&lt;ref name="Bose 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bose |first1=Christine E. |title=Intersectionality and Global Gender Inequality |journal=Gender &amp; Society |date=February 2012 |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=67–72 |doi=10.1177/0891243211426722 |s2cid=145233506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an issue globally with the way the law interacts with intersectionality, for example, the UK's legislation to protect workers' rights has a distinct issue with intersectionality. Under the Equality Act 2010, the things that are listed as 'protected characteristics' are "age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation".&lt;ref name="farrer.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.farrer.co.uk/news-and-insights/blogs/intersectionality-what-is-it-and-why-does-it-matter-for-employers/# |title=Intersectionality: What is it and why does it matter for employers?}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Section 14 contains a provision to cover direct discrimination on up to two combined grounds—known as combined or dual discrimination. However, this section has never been brought into effect as the government deemed it too 'complicated and burdensome' for businesses."&lt;ref name="farrer.co.uk"/&gt; This demonstrates systematic neglect of the issues that intersectionality presents, because the UK courts have explicitly decided not to cover intersectional discrimination in their courts.

Marie-Claire Belleau argues for "strategic intersectionality" in order to foster cooperation between feminisms of different ethnicities.&lt;ref name="Belleau 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Belleau |first=Marie-Claire |chapter=L'intersectionalité: Feminisms in a divided world; Québec-Canada |editor-last1=Orr |editor-first1=Deborah |title=Feminist Politics: identity, difference, and agency |pages=51–62 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers |location=Lanham, Md. |isbn=978-0-7425-4778-0 |display-editors=etal |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51}} She refers to different ''nat-cult'' (national-cultural) groups that produce different types of feminisms. Using [[Culture of Quebec|Québécois]] nat-cult as an example, Belleau says that many nat-cult groups contain infinite sub-identities within themselves, arguing that there are endless ways in which different feminisms can cooperate by using strategic intersectionality, and that these partnerships can help bridge gaps between "dominant and marginal" groups.&lt;ref name="Belleau 2007"/&gt;{{rp|54}} Belleau argues that, through strategic intersectionality, differences between nat-cult feminisms are neither essentialist nor universal, but should be understood as resulting from socio-cultural contexts. Furthermore, the performances of these nat-cult feminisms are also not essentialist. Instead, they are strategies.&lt;ref name="Belleau 2007"/&gt;

===Transnational intersectionality===
[[Postcolonial feminism|Third World feminists]] and [[transnational feminism|transnational feminists]] criticize intersectionality as a concept emanating from [[WEIRD]] (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic)&lt;ref name="WEIRD 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Henrich |first1=J. |last2=Heine |first2=S.

Vrushali Patil argues that intersectionality ought to recognize transborder constructions of racial and cultural hierarchies. About the effect of the state on identity formation, Patil says: "If we continue to neglect cross-border dynamics and fail to problematize the nation and its emergence via transnational processes, our analyses will remain tethered to the spatialities and temporalities of colonial modernity."&lt;ref name="Vrushali"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Patil |first1=Vrushali |title=From Patriarchy to Intersectionality: A Transnational Feminist Assessment of How Far We've Really Come |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |date=1 June 2013 |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=847–867 |doi=10.1086/669560 |jstor=10.1086/669560 |s2cid=144680534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social work===
In the field of [[social work]], proponents of intersectionality hold that unless service providers take intersectionality into account, they will be of less use for various segments of the population, such as those reporting domestic violence or disabled victims of abuse. According to intersectional theory, the practice of [[domestic violence]] counselors in the [[United States]] urging all women to report their abusers to police is of little use to [[women of color]] due to the history of racially motivated [[police brutality]], and those counselors should adapt their counseling for women of color.&lt;ref name="Bent-Goodley et al"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bent-Goodley, Tricia B. |author2=Chase, Lorraine |author3=Circo, Elizabeth A. |author4=Antá Rodgers, Selena T. |chapter=Our survival, our strengths: understanding the experiences of African American women in abusive relationships |editor-last1=Lockhart |editor-first1=Lettie |editor-last2=Danis |editor-first2=Fran S. |title=Domestic violence: intersectionality and culturally competent practice |page=77 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-231-14027-0 |year=2010 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/domesticviolence0000unse_e7x2/page/77/mode/1up |chapter-url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situated intersectionality===
Expanding on Crenshaw's framework, migration researcher Nira Yuval-Davis proposed the concept of situated intersectionality as a theoretical framework that can encompass different types of inequalities, simultaneously (ontologically), but enmeshed (concretely), and based on a dialogical epistemology which can incorporate "differentially located situated gazes" at these inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yuval-Davis |first1=Nira |date=2015|title=Situated Intersectionality and Social Inequality |journal=[[Raisons Politiques]] |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=91–100|doi=10.3917/rai.058.0091 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reilly, Bjørnholt and Tastsoglou note that "Yuval-Davis shares [[Martha Fineman|Fineman’s]] critical stance vis-à-vis the fragmentising and essentialising tendencies of identity politics, but without resorting to a universalism that eschews difference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reilly |first1=Niamh |last2=Bjørnholt |first2=Margunn |last3=Tastsoglou |first3=Evangelia |editor1-last=Freedman |editor1-first=Jane |editor2-last=Sahraoui |editor2-first=Nina |editor3-last=Tastsoglou |editor3-first=Evangelia|date=2022 |title=Gender-Based Violence in Migration |isbn=978-3-031-07929-0 |pages=29–56 |chapter=Vulnerability, Precarity and Intersectionality: A Critical Review of Three Key Concepts for Understanding Gender-Based Violence in Migration Contexts|doi= 10.1007/978-3-031-07929-0_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rekia Jibrin and Sara Salem argue that intersectional theory creates a unified idea of anti-oppression politics that requires a lot out of its adherents, often more than can reasonably be expected, creating difficulties achieving [[Praxis (process)|praxis]]. They also say that intersectional philosophy encourages a focus on the issues inside the group instead of on society at large, and that intersectionality is "a call to complexity and to abandon oversimplification... this has the parallel effect of emphasizing 'internal differences' over hegemonic structures".&lt;ref name="Jibrin 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Jibrin |first1=Rekia |last2=Salem |first2=Sara |title=Revisiting intersectionality: reflections on theory and praxis |journal=Trans-Scripts: An Interdisciplinary Online Journal in the Humanities and Social Sciences |volume=5 |date=2015 |url=https://cpb-us-e2.wpmucdn.com/sites.uci.edu/dist/f/1861/files/2014/10/2015_5_salem.pdf |issn=2160-6730}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{crossref|See [[Hegemony]] and [[Cultural hegemony]].}})

Barbara Tomlinson, of the Department of Feminist Studies at [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], has been critical of the applications of intersectional theory to attack other ways of feminist thinking.&lt;ref name="intersectionality993"/&gt;

Lisa Downing argues that intersectionality focuses too much on group identities, which can lead it to ignore the fact that people are individuals, not just members of a class. Ignoring this can cause intersectionality to lead to a simplistic analysis and inaccurate assumptions about how a person's values and attitudes are determined.&lt;ref name=Downing2018/&gt;

A review of quantitative studies seeking evidence on intersectional issues found statistical methods to be simplistic, and lacking theoretical foundation and methodological rigor, and identified a need for improved methods. &lt;ref name="Bauer2021" /&gt;

===Psychology===
{{Main|Biases|Heuristics in judgment and decision-making}}
Researchers in psychology have incorporated intersection effects since the 1950s{{Example needed|date=September 2018}}. These intersection effects were based on studying the lenses of biases, heuristics, stereotypes, and judgments. Psychologists have extended research in psychological biases to the areas of cognitive and motivational psychology. What is found, is that every human mind has its own biases in judgment and decision-making that tend to preserve the status quo by avoiding change and attention to ideas that exist outside one's personal realm of perception.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} Psychological interaction effects span a range of variables, although person-by-situation effects are the most examined category. As a result, psychologists do not construe the interaction effect of demographics such as gender and race as either more noteworthy or less noteworthy than any other interaction effect. In addition, oppression can be regarded as a subjective construct when viewed as an absolute hierarchy. Even if an objective definition of oppression was reached, person-by-situation effects would make it difficult to deem certain persons or categories of persons as uniformly oppressed. For instance, black men are stereotypically perceived as violent, which may be a disadvantage in police interactions, but also as physically attractive,&lt;ref name="Lewis 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lewis |first=Michael B. |title=A facial attractiveness account of gender asymmetries in interracial marriage |journal=[[PLOS ONE]] |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0031703 |date=9 February 2012 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=e31703 |pmid=22347504 |pmc=3276508 |bibcode=2012PLoSO...731703L |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lewis |first1=Michael B. |title=Who is the fairest of them all?

Psychological studies have shown that possessing multiple ''oppressed'' or ''marginalized identities'' has effects that are not necessarily additive, or even multiplicative, but rather, interactive in complex ways. For instance, black gay men may be more positively evaluated than black heterosexual men, because the "feminine" aspects of gay stereotypes temper the hypermasculine and aggressive aspect of black stereotypes.&lt;ref name=Pedulla2014&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pedulla |first1=David S. |title=The Positive Consequences of Negative Stereotypes: Race, Sexual Orientation, and the Job Application Process |journal=Social Psychology Quarterly |date=March 2014 |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=75–94 |doi=10.1177/0190272513506229 |s2cid=144311164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Remedios 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Remedios |first1=Jessica D. |last2=Chasteen |first2=Alison L. |last3=Rule |first3=Nicholas O. |last4=Plaks |first4=Jason E. |title=Impressions at the intersection of ambiguous and obvious social categories: Does gay+Black=likable? |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |date=November 2011 |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=1312–1315 |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2011.05.015 |hdl=1807/33199 |hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fattoracci 2020"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fattoracci |first1=Elisa S.

===Controversy in France===
In France, intersectionality has been denounced{{By whom|date=December 2021}} as a school of thought imported from the US.&lt;ref name="Faure"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Faure |first1=Valentine |date=21 December 2020 |title=Alain Policar : ' La fixation sur les origines tend à les transformer en destin ' |trans-title=Alain Policar : 'Fixating on the origins turns them into fate' |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2020/12/21/alain-policar-la-fixation-sur-les-origines-tend-a-les-transformer-en-destin_6064047_3232.html |language=fr |work=[[Le Monde]] |access-date=14 January 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French Minister of Education [[Jean-Michel Blanquer]] declared that intersectionality is in conflict with the French republican values. He accused advocates of intersectionality of playing into the hands of Islamism.&lt;ref name="Aeschimann"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Aeschimann |first1=Eric |last2=de La Porte |first2=Xavier |last3=Noyon |first3=Rémi |title=' Thèses intersectionnelles ' : Blanquer vous explique tout, mais n'a rien compris |trans-title='Intersectional Theses': Blanquer explains everything to you, but did not understand anything |language=fr |url=https://www.nouvelobs.com/idees/20201026.OBS35242/theses-intersectionnelles-blanquer-vous-explique-tout-mais-n-a-rien-compris.html |work=L'Obs |date=28 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In turn, ''[[Libération]]'' accused Blanquer of not having a good understanding of the concept of intersectionality and of attacking the concept for political reasons.&lt;ref name="Lagrave"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lagrave |first1=Rose-Marie |date=3 November 2020 |title=Intersectionnalité : Blanquer joue avec le feu |trans-title=Intersectionality: Blanquer is playing with fire |url=https://www.liberation.fr/debats/2020/11/03/intersectionnalite-blanquer-joue-avec-le-feu_1804309 |language=fr |work=[[Libération]] |access-date=14 January 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Murder of Samuel Paty]] supposedly provided a pretext{{According to whom|date=December 2021}} for such attacks on the concept of intersectionality.&lt;ref name="Molénat"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Molénat |first1=Xavier |date=6 November 2020 |title=Feu sur l'intersectionnalité ! |trans-title=Open fire on intersectionality! |url=https://www.alternatives-economiques.fr/feu-lintersectionnalite/00094407 |language=fr |work=[[Alternatives économiques]] |access-date=14 January 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conservatism ===
Conservatives believe that intersectionality allows people of color and women of color to victimize themselves and let themselves submit to special treatment. Instead, they classify the concept of intersectionality as a sort of hierarchy of oppression to see which person will receive more unfair treatment than another person would. American conservative commentator [[Ben Shapiro]] stated in a 2019 that "I would define intersectionality as, at least the way that I’ve seen it manifest on college campuses, and in a lot of the political left, as a hierarchy of victimhood in which people are considered members of a victim class by virtue of membership in a particular group, and at the intersection of various groups lies the ascent on the hierarchy".{{r|Coaston 2019}}
