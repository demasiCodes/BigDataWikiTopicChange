The term '''enemy of the people''' ([[Russian language]]: '''&amp;#1074;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1075; &amp;#1085;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1076;&amp;#1072;''', "vrag naroda") was a fluid designation under the [[Bolshevik]]s' rule in regards to their real or suspected political or class opponents, sometimes including former allies. Similar terms were in use as well: 
*''enemy of the workers'' (&amp;#1074;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1075; &amp;#1090;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1091;&amp;#1076;&amp;#1103;&amp;#1097;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1093;&amp;#1089;&amp;#1103;, "vrag trudyashchikhsya")
*''enemy of the proletariat'' (&amp;#1074;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1075; &amp;#1087;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1083;&amp;#1077;&amp;#1090;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1090;&amp;#1072;, "vrag proletariata")
*''class enemy'' (&amp;#1082;&amp;#1083;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1089;&amp;#1089;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1074;&amp;#1099;&amp;#1081; &amp;#1074;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1075;, "klassovyi vrag"), etc.

In particular, the term "enemy of workers" was formalized in the [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)]].

At various times these terms were applied, in particular, to the [[Royal House]], [[aristocrat]]s, the [[bourgeoisie]], [[cleric]]s, [[intelligentsia]], business entrepreneurs, [[kulak]]s, [[monarchist]]s, [[menshevik]]s, [[SR]]s, [[Bund]]ists, [[Zionism|Zionists]], [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]], [[Bukharin]]ists, the "old Bolsheviks", the army and police, [[emigrant]]s, [[immigrant]]s, [[saboteur]]s (&amp;#1074;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1077;&amp;#1076;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1090;&amp;#1077;&amp;#1083;&amp;#1080;, "vrediteli"), "[[social parasitism|social parasites]]", ''Kavezhedists'' (people who administered and serviced the [[KVZhD]] ([[China Far East Railway]]), particularly the Russian population of [[Harbin]], [[China]]), and members of certain ethnic groups (see [[Population transfer#Soviet Union|Population transfer: Soviet Union]]). 

An "enemy of the people" could be imprisoned, relocated, or executed, and his property could be confiscated. Close relatives of enemies of the people were branded "relatives of an enemy of the people", which effected in restrictions of their rights. They were commonly known as ''lishentsy'' (&amp;#1083;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1096;&amp;#1077;&amp;#1085;&amp;#1094;&amp;#1099;). Any family members of the victim still enjoying their freedom were not allowed to hold positions of importance, and only in exceptional cases would they be tolerated as members of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], the key to advancement in the Soviet hierarchy. Being a friend of an "enemy of the people" automatically placed the person under suspicion.

In 1927, the penal code of the Soviet Union was changed drastically. The update of the penal code turned the country into a police state, full of informants, who were derogatorily called ''stukach'' (&amp;#1089;&amp;#1090;&amp;#1091;&amp;#1082;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1095;, lit. "knocker"). According to [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)]], everyone was obligated to report all "anti-Soviet activity", including any expression of disagreement with the policy of the Party, even in casual jokes. This policy resulted in significant growth of [[Gulag]] camp populations as those who failed to report their relatives or friends were often themselves reported on. State-sponsored [[propaganda]] and mandatory (officially voluntary) participation in the [[Pioneer Movement]] helped to indoctrinate Soviet youth to follow the example of [[Pavlik Morozov]], a young boy who reported his own father, a [[kulak]]. 

One might wonder why there were so many enemies of workers left, seemingly contrary to the initial claims of [[Bolshevik]]s that the opponents of the [[proletariat]] were crushed as a [[class]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. This was handily explained by [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] doctrine, which included the "theory of the aggravation of class struggle". The theory postulated that class struggle grows more intense during the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], thus requiring more extreme measures. Anti-Stalinist Marxists, particularly [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]], reject this idea.

The extreme treatment of opponents is one of numerous reasons why the [[Bolshevik]] regime is often considered [[authoritarian]] or even [[totalitarian]] by its critics.
