The term '''enemy of the people''' is a fluid designation of political or [[Social class|class]] opponents of the group using the term. The term  implies that the "enemies" in question are acting  against society as a whole. It is similar to the notion of "[[enemy of the state]]". The term originated in [[Roman empire|Roman]] times as {{lang-lat|hostis publicus}}, typically translated into English as the "[[public enemy]]". The term in its "enemy of the people" form has been used for centuries in literature (''[[An Enemy of the People]]'', the play by [[Henrik Ibsen]], 1882). Currently this form is  mostly used as a reference to [[Soviet phraseology]].&lt;ref&gt;. [[Benedikt Sarnov]],''Our Soviet Newspeak: A Short Encyclopedia of Real Socialism.'', Moscow: 2002, ISBN 5-85646-059-6 (Наш советский новояз. Маленькая энциклопедия реального социализма.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the expression==
The expression dates back to Roman times; the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] declared emperor [[Nero]] a ''hostis publicus'' in AD 68.

The words ''ennemi du peuple'' were extensively used during the [[French revolution]]. 
On 25 December 1793 [[Robespierre]] stated: "The revolutionary government owes to the good citizen all the protection of the nation; it owes nothing to the Enemies of the People but death".

==Soviet Union==
The [[Soviet Union]] made extensive use of the term ([[Russian language]]: '''враг народа''', ''"vrag naroda"''), as it fit well with the idea that the people were in control.  The term was used by [[Vladimir Lenin]] after coming to power, as early as in the decree of 28 November 1917:

{{quote|all leaders of the [[Constitutional Democratic Party]], a party filled with enemies of the people, are hereby to be considered outlaws, and are to be arrested immediately and brought before the revolutionary court.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, [[Stéphane Courtois]], ''The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression'', [[Harvard University Press]], 1999, hardcover, 858 pages, ISBN 0-674-07608-7&lt;/ref&gt;}}
  
Other similar terms were in use as well:
*''enemy of the labourers'' (враг трудящихся, ''vrag trudyashchikhsya'')
*''enemy of the proletariat'' (враг пролетариата, ''vrag proletariata'')
*''class enemy'' (классовый враг, ''klassovyi vrag''), etc.
In particular, the term "enemy of the workers" was formalized in the [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberussr.com/rus/uk58-e.html#58-1a Article 58], an excerpt online&lt;/ref&gt; and similar articles in the codes of the other [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republics]].

At various times these terms were applied, in particular, to [[Tsar Nicholas II]] and the Imperial family, [[aristocracy|aristocrat]]s, the [[bourgeoisie]], [[cleric]]s, [[Robber baron (industrialist)|business entrepreneurs]], [[anarchism|anarchists]], [[kulak]]s, [[monarchism|monarchists]], [[Mensheviks]], [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Esers]], [[General Jewish Labor Union|Bundists]], [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]], [[Nikolai Bukharin|Bukharin]]ists, the "[[old Bolshevik]]s", the army and police, [[emigrant]]s, [[sabotage|saboteurs]], [[wrecking (Soviet crime)|wreckers]] (вредители, "vrediteli"), "[[parasitism (social offense)|social parasites]]" (тунеядцы, "tuneyadtsy"), ''Kavezhedists'' (people who administered and serviced the [[Chinese Eastern Railway|KVZhD]] (China Far East Railway), particularly the Russian population of [[Harbin]], [[China]]), those considered [[bourgeois nationalism|bourgeois nationalists]] (notably [[Russian nationalism|Russian]], [[Ukrainian nationalism|Ukrainian]], [[Belarusians|Belarusian]], [[Armenian nationalism|Armenian]], [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]], [[Latvians|Latvian]], [[Estonians|Estonian]] nationalists, [[Zionism|Zionists]], [[Basmachi]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?page=article&amp;ArticleID=1929rysakov1&amp;SubjectID=1929sovietization&amp;Year=1929]&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''enemy of the people'' could be imprisoned, expelled or executed, and lose their property to confiscation. Close relatives of enemies of the people were labeled as "[[Order about Family Members of Traitors of the Motherland|traitor of Motherland family members]]" and prosecuted.  They could be sent to [[Gulag]], punished by the [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|involuntary settlement]] in unpopulated areas, or [[Lishenets|stripped of citizen's rights]]. Being a friend of an ''enemy of the people'' automatically placed the person under suspicion.

A significant fraction of the ''enemies of the people'' were given this label not because of their hostile actions against the ''workers' and peasants' state'', but simply because of their social origin or profession before the revolution: those who used hired labor, high-ranking clergy, former policemen, merchants, etc. Some of them were commonly known as ''[[lishenets|lishentsy]]'' (лишенцы, derived from Russian word ''лишение'', deprivation), because by the [[Soviet Constitution]] they were deprived of the right of [[voting]]. This automatically translated into a deprivation of various social benefits; some of them, e.g., [[rationing]], were at times critical for survival.

Since 1927, Article 20 of the Common Part of the penal code that listed possible "measures of social defence" had the following item 20a: "declaration to be an enemy of the workers with deprivation of the union republic citizenship and hence of the USSR citizenship, with obligatory expulsion from its territory". Nevertheless, most "enemies of the people" suffered labor camps, rather than expulsion.

The term returned to the public discourse in late 2000's with a number of nationalist and pro-government politicians (most notably [[Ramzan Kadyrov]]) called for restoration of the Soviet approach to the "enemies of the people" defined as all [[non-system opposition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pravda.info/society/5632.html | title=Опубликован шорт-лист претендентов на звание "враг народа в левом движении" | date=2006 | accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gazeta.ru/politics/news/2016/01/13/n_8111345.shtml | title=Кадыров призвал относиться к внесистемной оппозиции как к врагам народа | date=2015 | accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.znak.com/urfo/news/06-12-14-44/1032579.html | title=На площадке путинского "Народного фронта" предложили вернуть в употребление статус "враг народа" | date=2014 | accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
