The terms '''enemy of the people''' and '''enemy of the nation''' are designations for the political opponents and for the [[social class|social-class]] opponents of the [[Power (social and political)|power group]] within a larger social unit, who, thus identified, can be subjected to political repression.&lt;ref&gt;"Enemies of the people", '' A Dictionary of 20th-century Communism'' (2010) Silvio Pons and Robert Service, Eds. pp. 307–308.&lt;/ref&gt; In political praxis, the term ''enemy of the people'' implies that political opposition to the ruling power group renders the people in opposition into enemies acting against the interests of the greater social unit, e.g. the political party, society, the nation, etc.

In the 20th century, the politics of the [[Soviet Union]] (1922–1991) much featured the term ''enemy of the people'' to discredit any opposition, especially during the régime of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] (r. 1924–1953), when it was often applied to [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trump-and-the-enemies-of-the-people |title=Trump and the Enemies of the People |last=Remnick |first=David |magazine=The New Yorker |date=1 August 2018|access-date=22 August 2019 |language=en |issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Remnick|first=David|date=August 20, 1990|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1990/08/20/trotsky-in-afterlife/a0bcdac2-4f42-4293-b0a4-ddbe9b866344/|title=Trotsky in Afterlife|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|quote=For decades, Soviet reference books referred to him only as an anti-Soviet plotter and "enemy of the people" – if they referred to him at all.

Like the term ''[[enemy of the state]]'', the term ''enemy of the people'' originated and derives from the {{lang-lat|hostis publicus}}, a [[public enemy]] of the [[Roman Empire]]. In literature, the term ''enemy of the people'' features in the title of the stageplay ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' (1882), by [[Henrik Ibsen]], and is a theme in the stageplay ''[[Coriolanus]]'' (1605), by [[William Shakespeare]].

==Origins==
===Rome: the Republic and the Empire===
The expression ''enemy of the people'' dates to [[Imperial Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;see also Jal, Paul (1963) [http://www.persee.fr/doc/rea_0035-2004_1963_num_65_1_3689 ''Hostis (publicus) dans la littérature latine de la fin de la République''], footnotes 1 and 2&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Senate|Senate]] declared Emperor [[Nero]] a ''hostis publicus'' in 68 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Garzetti, Albino (2014) ''From Tiberius to the Antonines: A History of the Roman Empire AD 14–192'', Routledge. p. 220 {{ISBN|978-1317698432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its direct translation is "public enemy". Whereas "public" is currently used in [[English language|English]] to describe something related to collectivity at large, with an implication towards government or the State, the [[Latin]] word "publicus" could, in addition to that meaning, also refer directly to people, making it the equivalent of the [[Genitive case|genitive]] of ''populus'' ("people"), ''populi'' ("popular" or "of the people"). Thus, "public enemy" and "enemy of the people" are, etymologically, near [[synonyms]].

===French Revolution===
The words ''[[:fr:Ennemi du peuple|ennemi du peuple]]'' were used extensively during the [[French Revolution]]. On 25 December 1793 [[Robespierre]] stated: "The revolutionary government owes to the good citizen all the protection of the nation; it owes nothing to the Enemies of the People but death".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robespierre]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=ik2jUBnhZbgC&amp;pg=PA392&amp;lpg=PA39 "Le but du gouvernement constitutionnel est de conserver la République; celui du gouvernement révolutionnaire est de la fonder. &amp;#91;…&amp;#93; Le gouvernement révolutionnaire doit au bon citoyen toute la protection nationale; il ne doit aux Ennemis du Peuple que la mort"] (speech at the [[National Convention]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Law of 22 Prairial]] in 1794 extended the remit of the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]] to punish "enemies of the people", with some political crimes punishable by death, including "spreading false news to divide or trouble the people".&lt;ref name=higgins&gt;Higgins, Andrew (26 February 2017) [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/26/world/europe/trump-enemy-of-the-people-stalin.html "Trump Embraces ‘Enemy of the People,’ a Phrase With a Fraught History"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marxist–Leninist states==
===Soviet Union===
The [[Soviet Union]] made extensive use of the term ({{lang-ru|link=no|враг народа}}, ''vrag naroda'') (literal meaning is the enemy of the people). The term was first used in a speech by [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]], the first chairman of the [[Cheka]], after the [[October Revolution]]. The [[Petrograd Military Revolutionary Committee]] printed lists of "enemies of the people", and [[Vladimir Lenin]] invoked it in his decree of 28 November 1917:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41256361|title=The black book of communism : crimes, terror, repression|date=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press|others=Stéphane Courtois, Mark Kramer|isbn=0-674-07608-7|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=41256361}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|...all leaders of the [[Constitutional Democratic Party]], a party filled with enemies of the people, are hereby to be considered outlaws, and are to be arrested immediately and brought before the revolutionary court.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;Werth, Nicolas; Bartošek, Karel; Panné, Jean-Louis; Margolin, Jean-Louis; Paczkowski, Andrzej; and [[Stéphane Courtois|Courtois, Stéphane]] (1999) ''The [[Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[Harvard University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-674-07608-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other similar terms were in use as well:
*''enemy of the labourers'' (враг трудящихся, ''vrag trudyashchikhsya'')
*''enemy of the proletariat'' (враг пролетариата, ''vrag proletariata'')
*''class enemy'' (классовый враг, ''klassovyi vrag''), etc.

In particular, the term "enemy of the workers" was formalized in the [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberussr.com/rus/uk58-e.html#58-1a "Article 58"], an online excerpt&lt;/ref&gt; and similar articles in the codes of the other [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republics]].

At various times these terms were applied, in particular, to [[Tsar Nicholas II]] and the [[House of Romanov|Imperial family]], [[aristocracy|aristocrat]]s, the [[bourgeoisie]], [[cleric]]s, [[Robber baron (industrialist)|business entrepreneurs]], [[anarchism|anarchists]], [[kulak]]s, [[monarchism|monarchists]], [[Mensheviks]], [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Esers]], [[General Jewish Labor Union|Bundists]], [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]], [[Nikolai Bukharin|Bukharin]]ists, the "[[old Bolshevik]]s", the army and police, [[emigrant]]s, [[sabotage|saboteurs]], [[wrecking (Soviet crime)|wreckers]] (вредители, "vrediteli"), "[[parasitism (social offense)|social parasites]]" (тунеядцы, "tuneyadtsy"), ''Kavezhedists'' (people who administered and serviced the [[Chinese Eastern Railway|KVZhD]] (China Far East Railway), particularly the Russian population of [[Harbin]], China), those considered [[bourgeois nationalism|bourgeois nationalists]] (notably [[Russian nationalism|Russian]], [[Ukrainian nationalism|Ukrainian]], [[Belarusian nationalism|Belarusian]], [[Armenian nationalism|Armenian]], [[Lithuanian nationalism|Lithuanian]], Latvian, [[Estonian nationalism|Estonian nationalists]], [[Zionism|Zionists]], [[Basmachi movement|Basmachi]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?page=article&amp;ArticleID=1929rysakov1&amp;SubjectID=1929sovietization&amp;Year=1929|title=Seventeen Moments in Soviet History}} {{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/4170187 |title=«Объявить всех врагами народа»: Как пропагандистский штамп превратился в страшный приговор |trans-title=To declare everyone the enemy of the people: how a propagandistic cliche turned into a sinister verdict |work=[[Kommersant]] |lang=ru |date=29 November 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An "enemy of the people" could be imprisoned, expelled or executed, and lose their property to confiscation. Close relatives of enemies of the people were labeled as "[[Order about Family Members of Traitors of the Motherland|traitor of Motherland family members]]" and prosecuted. They could be sent to [[Gulag]], punished by the [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|involuntary settlement]] in unpopulated areas, or [[Lishenets|stripped of citizen's rights]]. Being a friend of an ''enemy of the people'' automatically placed the person under suspicion.

A majority of the ''enemies of the people'' were given this label not because of their hostile actions against the ''workers' and peasants' state'', but simply because of their social origin or profession before the revolution{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}: those who used hired labor, high-ranking clergy, former policemen, merchants, etc. Some of them were commonly known as ''[[lishenets|lishentsy]]'' (лишенцы, derived from Russian word ''лишение'', deprivation), because by the [[Soviet Constitution]] they were deprived of the right of [[voting]]. This automatically translated into a deprivation of various social benefits; some of them, e.g., [[rationing]], were at times critical for survival.

Since 1927, Article 20 of the Common Part of the penal code that listed possible "measures of [[social defence]]" had the following item 20a: "declaration to be an enemy of the workers with deprivation of the union republic citizenship and hence of the [[Soviet nationality law|USSR citizenship]], with obligatory expulsion from its territory". Nevertheless, most "enemies of the people" suffered labor camps, rather than expulsion.

====Rejection of the phrase====
On 25 February 1956, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] delivered a speech to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] in which he identified [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] as the author of the phrase and distanced himself from it, saying that it made debate impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Higgins|first=Andrew|date=2017-02-26|title=Trump Embraces 'Enemy of the People,' a Phrase With a Fraught History|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/26/world/europe/trump-enemy-of-the-people-stalin.html|access-date=2020-09-24|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; "This term automatically made it unnecessary that the ideological errors of a man or men engaged in a controversy be proven," Khrushchev said. "It made possible the use of the cruelest repression, violating all norms of [...] legality, against anyone who in any way disagreed with Stalin, against those who were only suspected of hostile intent, against those who had bad reputations ... The formula ‘enemy of the people’ was specifically introduced for the purpose of physically annihilating such individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Khrushchev|first=Nikita|date=2007-04-26|title=The cult of the individual (25 Feb 1956)|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/apr/26/greatspeeches1|access-date=2020-09-24|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Resurgence====
For decades afterwards, the phrase "was so omnipresent, freighted and devastating in its use under Stalin that nobody [in Russia] wanted to touch it. ... except in reference to history and in jokes", according to [[William Taubman]] in his biography of Khrushchev.&lt;ref name="higgins" /&gt;

However, the term returned to Russian public discourse in the late 2000s with a number of nationalist and pro-government politicians (most notably [[Ramzan Kadyrov]]) calling for restoration of the Soviet approach to the "enemies of the people" defined as all [[non-system opposition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff| url=http://www.pravda.info/society/5632.html | title=Опубликован шорт-лист претендентов на звание "враг народа в левом движении" |year=2006 | access-date=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff| url=http://www.gazeta.ru/politics/news/2016/01/13/n_8111345.shtml | title=Кадыров призвал относиться к внесистемной оппозиции как к врагам народа |year=2015 | access-date=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Staff | url=http://www.znak.com/urfo/news/06-12-14-44/1032579.html | title=На площадке путинского "Народного фронта" предложили вернуть в употребление статус "враг народа" | year=2014 | access-date=13 January 2016 | archive-date=15 November 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151115024045/http://www.znak.com/urfo/news/06-12-14-44/1032579.html | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 December 2022, [[Dmitry Medvedev]], Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of Russia, said that Russians who fled Russia after the invasion of Ukraine and are [[2022 anti-war protests in Russia|opposed to the war]] should be labeled "enemies of society" and barred from returning to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Medvedev Calls for Recent Russian Emigres to Be Banned From Returning |url=https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/12/28/medvedev-calls-for-recent-russian-emigres-to-be-banned-from-returning-a79824 |work=[[The Moscow Times]] |date=28 December 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cambodia and China===
According to [[Philip Short]], an author of biographies of [[Mao Zedong]] and Cambodia's [[Khmer Rouge]] leader [[Pol Pot]], in domestic political struggles Chinese and Cambodian communists rarely if ever used the phrase "enemy of the people" as they were very nationalistic and saw it as an alien import.&lt;ref name=higgins /&gt;

In 1957, in the speech and in the essay ''[[On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People]]'', Mao said that: "At the present stage, the period of building socialism, the classes, strata and social groups which favour, support and work for the cause of socialist construction all come within the category of the people, while the social forces and groups which resist the socialist revolution and are hostile to or sabotage socialist construction are all enemies of the people."&lt;ref&gt;Mao Zedong (27 February 1957) [https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch04.htm ''On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People'' pp. 2–3]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albania===
Enemy of the people ([[Albanian language|Alb]]: '''Armiku i popullit''') in Albania were the enemy [[Linguistic typology|typology]] of the [[Communist Albania]]n government used to denounce political or class opponents. The term is today considered [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]], [[derogatory]] and [[hostile]]. There are still some politicians who use the term on political opponents with the intention of dehumanization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Enemies of the People, History, Ideology Behind The … |date=2019 |publisher=Remarks by Head of Presence, Ambassador Bernd Borchardt, at the international scientific conference "The portrait of ‘people’s enemy’ during the dictatorship of proletariat in Albania (1944–1990) 17 May 2019 |url=https://www.osce.org/presence-in-albania/419939?download=true}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the aftermath of [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|the referendum on membership of the European Union]], the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' was criticized for a headline describing judges (in [[R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union|the ''Miller'' case]]) as "Enemies of the People" for ruling that the process for leaving the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|European Union]] (i.e. the triggering of [[Article 50]]) would require the consent of the [[British Parliament]].
