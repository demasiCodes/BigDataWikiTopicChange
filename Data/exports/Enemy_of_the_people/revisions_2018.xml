The term '''enemy of the people''' is a designation for the political or [[Social class|class]] opponents of the subgroup in power within a larger group. The term implies that by opposing the ruling subgroup, the "enemies" in question are acting against the larger group, for example against society as a whole. It is similar to the notion of "[[enemy of the state]]". The term originated in [[Roman empire|Roman]] times as {{lang-lat|hostis publicus}}, typically translated into English as the "[[public enemy]]". The term in its "enemy of the people" form has been used for centuries in literature (see ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'', the play by [[Henrik Ibsen]], 1882; or ''[[Coriolanus]]'', the play by [[William Shakespeare]], c. 1605). Currently this form is mostly used as a reference to [[Soviet phraseology]].&lt;ref&gt;.

==Origins of the expression==
The expression dates back to [[Imperial Rome|Roman times]].&lt;ref&gt;see also Jal, Paul (1963) [http://www.persee.fr/doc/rea_0035-2004_1963_num_65_1_3689 ''Hostis (publicus) dans la littérature latine de la fin de la République], footnotes 1 and 2&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Roman Senate|Senate]] declared emperor [[Nero]] a ''hostis publicus'' in AD 68.&lt;ref&gt;Garzetti, Albino (2014) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Bk3XAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT220 ''From Tiberius to the Antonines: A History of the Roman Empire AD 14-192''], Routledge. p.220 {{ISBN|9781317698432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The words "''[[:fr:Ennemi du peuple|ennemi du peuple]]''" were extensively used during the [[French revolution]]. On 25 December 1793 [[Robespierre]] stated: "The revolutionary government owes to the good citizen all the protection of the nation; it owes nothing to the Enemies of the People but death".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robespierre]][https://books.google.com/books?id=ik2jUBnhZbgC&amp;pg=PA392&amp;lpg=PA39 "Le but du gouvernement constitutionnel est de conserver la République ; celui du gouvernement révolutionnaire est de la fonder. &amp;#91;…&amp;#93; Le gouvernement révolutionnaire doit au bon citoyen toute la protection nationale ; il ne doit aux Ennemis du Peuple que la mort" (speech at the [[National Convention]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Law of 22 Prairial]] in 1794 extended the remit of the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]] to punish "enemies of the people", with some political crimes punishable by death, including "spreading false news to divide or trouble the people".&lt;ref name=higgins&gt;Higgins, Andrew (February 26, 2017) [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/26/world/europe/trump-enemy-of-the-people-stalin.html "Trump Embraces ‘Enemy of the People,’ a Phrase With a Fraught History"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marxist–Leninist states==

===Soviet Union===
The [[Soviet Union]] made extensive use of the term ({{lang-ru|враг народа}}, ''vrag naroda''), as it fit well with the idea that the people were in control. The term was used by [[Vladimir Lenin]] after coming to power, as early as in the decree of 28 November 1917:
{{quote|all leaders of the [[Constitutional Democratic Party]], a party filled with enemies of the people, are hereby to be considered outlaws, and are to be arrested immediately and brought before the revolutionary court.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;Werth, Nicolas; Bartošek, Karel; Panné, Jean-Louis; Margolin, Jean-Louis; Paczkowski, Andrzej; and [[Stéphane Courtois|Courtois, Stéphane]] (1999) ''The [[Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[Harvard University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-674-07608-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other similar terms were in use as well:
*''enemy of the labourers'' (враг трудящихся, ''vrag trudyashchikhsya'')
*''enemy of the proletariat'' (враг пролетариата, ''vrag proletariata'')
*''class enemy'' (классовый враг, ''klassovyi vrag''), etc.

In particular, the term "enemy of the workers" was formalized in the [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberussr.com/rus/uk58-e.html#58-1a "Article 58"], an online excerpt&lt;/ref&gt; and similar articles in the codes of the other [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republics]].

At various times these terms were applied, in particular, to [[Tsar Nicholas II]] and the Imperial family, [[aristocracy|aristocrat]]s, the [[bourgeoisie]], [[cleric]]s, [[Robber baron (industrialist)|business entrepreneurs]], [[anarchism|anarchists]], [[kulak]]s, [[monarchism|monarchists]], [[Mensheviks]], [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Esers]], [[General Jewish Labor Union|Bundists]], [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]], [[Nikolai Bukharin|Bukharin]]ists, the "[[old Bolshevik]]s", the army and police, [[emigrant]]s, [[sabotage|saboteurs]], [[wrecking (Soviet crime)|wreckers]] (вредители, "vrediteli"), "[[parasitism (social offense)|social parasites]]" (тунеядцы, "tuneyadtsy"), ''Kavezhedists'' (people who administered and serviced the [[Chinese Eastern Railway|KVZhD]] (China Far East Railway), particularly the Russian population of [[Harbin]], [[China]]), those considered [[bourgeois nationalism|bourgeois nationalists]] (notably [[Russian nationalism|Russian]], [[Ukrainian nationalism|Ukrainian]], [[Belarusians|Belarusian]], [[Armenian nationalism|Armenian]], [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]], [[Latvians|Latvian]], [[Estonians|Estonian]] nationalists, [[Zionism|Zionists]], [[Basmachi]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?page=article&amp;ArticleID=1929rysakov1&amp;SubjectID=1929sovietization&amp;Year=1929 "Seventeen Moments in Soviet History"]&lt;/ref&gt;

An "enemy of the people" could be imprisoned, expelled or executed, and lose their property to confiscation. Close relatives of enemies of the people were labeled as "[[Order about Family Members of Traitors of the Motherland|traitor of Motherland family members]]" and prosecuted. They could be sent to [[Gulag]], punished by the [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|involuntary settlement]] in unpopulated areas, or [[Lishenets|stripped of citizen's rights]]. Being a friend of an ''enemy of the people'' automatically placed the person under suspicion.

A significant fraction of the ''enemies of the people'' were given this label not because of their hostile actions against the ''workers' and peasants' state'', but simply because of their social origin or profession before the revolution: those who used hired labor, high-ranking clergy, former policemen, merchants, etc. Some of them were commonly known as ''[[lishenets|lishentsy]]'' (лишенцы, derived from Russian word ''лишение'', deprivation), because by the [[Soviet Constitution]] they were deprived of the right of [[voting]]. This automatically translated into a deprivation of various social benefits; some of them, e.g., [[rationing]], were at times critical for survival.

Since 1927, Article 20 of the Common Part of the penal code that listed possible "measures of [[social defence]]" had the following item 20a: "declaration to be an enemy of the workers with deprivation of the union republic citizenship and hence of the USSR citizenship, with obligatory expulsion from its territory". Nevertheless, most "enemies of the people" suffered labor camps, rather than expulsion.

In his 1956 speech denouncing Stalin’s cult of personality, Stalin's successor [[Nikita Khrushchev]] called for an end to the use of the term, stating "the formula 'enemy of the people' was specifically introduced for the purpose of physically annihilating such individuals" who disagreed with Stalin.&lt;ref name=higgins /&gt; For decades afterwards, "It was so omnipresent, freighted and devastating in its use under Stalin that nobody [in Russia] wanted to touch it. ... except in reference to history and in jokes", according to an author of a biography of Khrushchev, William Taubman.&lt;ref name=higgins /&gt;

The term returned to Russian public discourse in the late 2000s with a number of nationalist and pro-government politicians (most notably [[Ramzan Kadyrov]]) calling for restoration of the Soviet approach to the "enemies of the people" defined as all [[non-system opposition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff| url=http://www.pravda.info/society/5632.html | title=Опубликован шорт-лист претендентов на звание "враг народа в левом движении" | date=2006 | accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff| url=http://www.gazeta.ru/politics/news/2016/01/13/n_8111345.shtml | title=Кадыров призвал относиться к внесистемной оппозиции как к врагам народа | date=2015 | accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff| url=http://www.znak.com/urfo/news/06-12-14-44/1032579.html | title=На площадке путинского "Народного фронта" предложили вернуть в употребление статус "враг народа" | date=2014 | accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
In [[Mao Zedong]]'s 1957 speech ''On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People'', he comments that "At the present stage, the period of building socialism, the classes, strata and social groups which favour, support and work for the cause of socialist construction all come within the category of the people, while the social forces and groups which resist the socialist revolution and are hostile to or sabotage socialist construction are all ''enemies of the people''."&lt;ref&gt;Mao Zedong (February 27, 1957) [https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch04.htm ''On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People'' pp.2–3]&lt;/ref&gt; (According to [[Philip Short]], an author of biographies of Mao and Cambodia's [[Khmer Rouge]] leader [[Pol Pot]], in domestic political struggles Chinese and Cambodian communists rarely if ever used the phrase "enemy of the people" as they were very nationalistic, and saw it as an alien import.)&lt;ref name=higgins /&gt;

==Nazi Germany==
Regarding [[Madagascar Plan|the Nazi plan to relocate all Jews to Madagascar]], the Nazi tabloid ''[[Der Stürmer]]'' wrote that "The Jews don't want to go to Madagascar – They cannot bear the climate. Jews are pests and disseminators of diseases. In whatever country they settle and spread themselves out, they produce the same effects as are produced in the human body by germs. ... In former times sane people and sane leaders of the peoples made short shrift of ''enemies of the people''. They had them either expelled or killed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Germ|url=https://www.phdn.org/archives/www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/genocide/antisem14.htm|newspaper=[[Der Stürmer]]|issue=38|date=September 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;
