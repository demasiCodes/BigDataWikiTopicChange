'''Ethnocide''' refers to [[cultural genocide|extermination of national culture]] as a [[genocide]] component.&lt;ref name="Shaw2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoC2-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DelantyKumar2006"/&gt;

Reviewing the legal and academic history of usage of the terms genocide and ethnocide, [[Bartolomé Clavero]] differentiates between them in that "Genocide kills people while ethnocide kills social cultures through the killing of individual souls".&lt;ref name="Clavero2008"/&gt; In addition, "since cultural genocide can only be the cultural dimension ''of'' genocide", the idea of ethnocide is more than just "cultural genocide", but also part of broader genocidal process.&lt;ref name="Shaw2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Shaw|title=What is Genocide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVnl-HgG4QEC&amp;pg=PA65|accessdate=28 February 2013|date=20 March 2007|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-3182-0|pages=65–67|quote=So the idea of ethnocide as 'cultural genocide' distinct from physically violent genocide is misleading, since cultural genocide can only be the cultural dimension ''of'' genocide, something which is integral to every genocidal attack. ... It is better to refer to cultural suppression for pre-genocidal denial of culture, the cultural dimension of genocide for suppression that is part of broader genocidal process, and unintentional group destruction for cases where groups are destroyed by disease and famine that are originally unintended.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because concepts such as [[cultural genocide]] and ethnocide have been used in different contexts, the anthropology of genocide examines their inclusion and exclusion in law and policies.&lt;ref name="BloxhamMoses2010"/&gt;

==Origin of the word==
{{Discrimination sidebar}}
[[Raphael Lemkin]], the linguist and lawyer who coined ''genocide'' in 1943 as the union of "the Greek word ''genos'' (race, tribe) and the Latin ''cide'' (killing)", also suggested ''ethnocide'' as an alternative form representing the same concept, using the Greek ''ethnos'' (nation) in place of ''genos''.&lt;ref name="AutoC2-1"/&gt; However, the term genocide has received much wider adoption than ethnocide.&lt;ref name="Shaw2007"/&gt;

==Usage==
As early as 1933, lawyer Raphael Lemkin proposed a cultural component to genocide, which he called "cultural genocide".&lt;ref name="AutoC2-2"/&gt; The term has since acquired rhetorical value as a phrase that is used to protest against the destruction of cultural heritage. 

===Proposed usage===
{{wikisource|Draft United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples}}
{{wikisource|Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples}}
The drafters of the 1948 [[Genocide Convention]] considered the use of the term, but dropped it from their consideration.&lt;ref name="AutoC2-3"/&gt; The legal definition of [[genocide]] is left unspecific about the exact nature in which genocide is done only that it is destruction with intent to destroy a racial, religious, ethnic or national group as such.&lt;ref name="AutoC2-4"/&gt;

Article 7 of a 1994 draft of the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] uses both the word "ethnocide" and the phrase "cultural genocide" but does not define what they mean.&lt;ref name="AutoC2-5"/&gt; The complete article reads as follows:
:Indigenous peoples have the collective and individual right not to be subjected to ethnocide and [[cultural genocide]], including prevention of and redress for:
::(a) Any action which has the aim or effect of depriving them of their integrity as distinct peoples, or of their cultural values or ethnic identities;
::(b) Any action which has the aim or effect of dispossessing them of their lands, territories or resources;
::(c) Any form of [[population transfer]] which has the aim or effect of violating or undermining any of their rights;
::(d) Any form of [[acculturation|assimilation or integration]] by other cultures or ways of life imposed on them by legislative, administrative or other measures;
::(e) Any form of propaganda directed against them.

The [[United Nations]] Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] during its 62nd session at [[UN Headquarters]] in [[New York City]] on 13 September 2007, but only mentions "genocide", not "cultural genocide", although the article is otherwise unchanged.

==Notions of ethnocide==

===UNESCO===
In [[UNESCO]] "Declaration of San Jose":&lt;ref name="Schabas2000"/&gt;

{{quote|Ethnocide means that an ethnic group is denied the right to enjoy, develop and transmit its own culture and its own language, whether collectively or individually. This involves an extreme form of massive violation of human rights and, in particular, the right of ethnic groups to respect for their cultural identity.}}

===Robert Jaulin===
{{main|Robert Jaulin#The concept of ethnocide}}
The French ethnologist [[Robert Jaulin]] (1928-1996) proposed a redefinition of the concept of ethnocide in 1970, to refer not  the ''means'' but the ''ends'' that define ethnocide.&lt;ref name="AutoC2-6"/&gt; Accordingly, the ethnocide would be the systematic destruction of the thought and the way of life of people different from those who carry out this enterprise of destruction. Whereas the genocide assassinates the people in their body, the ethnocide kills them in their spirit.
