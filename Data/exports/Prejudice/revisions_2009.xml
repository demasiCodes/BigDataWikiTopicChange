[[Image:National Conveniences 1024.jpg|thumbnail|300px|Four-way 18th-century English prejudice]]
A '''prejudice''' is a preconceived belief, opinion, or judgment toward a group of people or a single person because of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[social class]], [[gender]], [[ethnicity]], [[sexual orientation]], [[Ageing|age]], [[disability]], [[political beliefs]] , [[religion]], [[line of work]] or other personal characteristics. It also means [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] beliefs (without knowledge of the facts) and includes "any unreasonable attitude that is unusually resistant to rational influence."&lt;ref&gt;Rosnow, Ralph L.; ''Poultry and Prejudice.'' Psychologist Today, (March, 1972): p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Although positive and negative prejudice both exist, when used negatively, "prejudice" implies fear and [[antipathy]] toward such a group or person.

* '''Cognitive Prejudice''' refers to what people believe to be true: for example, in adherence to a particular [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] or [[methodology|methodological]] philosophy at the expense of other [[philosophy|philosophies]] which may offer a more complete theoretical explanation.
* '''Affective Prejudice''' refers to what people like and dislike: for example, in attitudes toward members of particular [[social class|classes]] such as [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], national origin, or [[creed]].
* '''Conative Prejudice''' refers to how people are inclined to behave.  It is regarded as an attitude because people do not act on their feelings.  An example of conative prejudice may be found in expressions of what should be done if the opportunity presents itself.

These three types of prejudice are correlated, but all need not be present in a particular individual.  Someone may believe that a particular group possesses low levels of [[intelligence]], but harbourlyness no ill feeling towards that group.  A group may be disliked because of intense competition for jobs, but still recognise no differences between groups.

"[[Discrimination]]" is a behaviour (an action), with reference to unequal treatment of people because they are members of a particular group. Farley also put discrimination into three categories:&lt;ref&gt;Farley, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Personal / Individual Discrimination''' is directed toward a specific individual and refers to any act that leads to unequal treatment because of the individual's real or perceived group membership.
* '''Legal Discrimination''' refers to "unequal treatment, on the grounds of group membership, that is upheld by law."&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Apartheid]] is an example of legal discrimination, as are also various post-[[Civil war]] laws in the southern [[United States]] that legally disadvantaged [[negro]]s with respect to property rights, employment rights and the exercise of [[constitutional right]]s.
* '''Institutional Discrimination''' refers to unequal treatment that is entrenched in basic [[social organization|social institutions]] resulting in advantaging one group over another. The [[India]]n [[caste system]] and European feudal system are historical examples of institutional discrimination.

As with prejudice generally, these three types of discrimination are correlated and may be found to varying degrees in individuals and [[society]] at large.  Many forms of discrimination based upon prejudice are outwardly acceptable in most societies.

==Origins of prejudice==
Prejudice has been researched extensively, and psychologists generally take the following approaches: arousal, personality, intergroup interaction and learning. 

=== Arousal approach ===
Following the [[psychodynamic]] perspective, some traditional psychologists described prejudice a result relationship between frustration and aggression.  Critics argue that this theory can only explain limited factors of intergroup aggression.  Moreover, the theory has been criticised on grounds of its [[reductionism]] (Billig, 1976; Brown, 2000; Hogg &amp; Abrams, 1988).

===Intergroup approach===
Some social psychologists explain prejudice as the effect of group interaction. According to [[social identity theory]], when we are identified with a group, we show some general characteristics including [[ethnocentrism]], ingroup favoritism, intergroup differentiation and so on, which contribute to prejudice. Tajfel, Billig, Bundy, and Flament (1971) further devised the [[minimal group paradigm]] to illustrate the necessary condition for group identification, stating that merely categorizing people into group is sufficient to induce the general characteristics. Besides, group interaction would almost inevitably induce intergroup competitions, the [[realistic conflict theory|realistic conflict]] between group could also accentuate the negative [[stereotypes]] on the out-group.
Some empirical data disconfirmed the minimal group paradigm by showing that social categorization is not sufficient for intergroup behaviour (Grieve &amp; Hogg, 1999). Moreover, since many variables are operating in intergroup studies, this approach has also been criticized on being unable to identify causal relationship between group formation and prejudice due to potential [[confounding]] (Dion, 1979; Turner, 1981).

== Contemporary theories ==
Contemporary theories of intergroup bias (prejudice) tend to explain intergroup bias in terms of various social psychological motivations (Miles, Mark &amp; Hazel, 2002). They are [[social identity theory]], [[terror management]] and subjective uncertainty reduction theory.

===Terror management theory===
Solomon, Greenberg and Pyszczynski (1999) in their [[terror management theory]] proposed that people have a need for [[self-preservation]] which is raised and frustrated by their awareness of the inevitability of their own [[death]]. To deal with their mortality, people adopt a cultural [[world view]] that imbues subjective reality with stability and permanence and provides standards of value against which judgments of [[self-esteem]] can be made. According to [[Terror management theory]], people evaluate in-group members positively because similar others are assumed to support, and therefore validate, their own cultural world view; in contrast, they evaluate out-group members negatively because dissimilar others are assumed to threaten their world view. There is extensive evidence that people show greater intergroup bias when they are made aware of their own mortality (Florian &amp; Mikulincer, 1998).

===Subjective uncertainty reduction theory===
Moreover, Hogg (2000) in his subjective uncertainty reduction theory proposed that people are motivated to reduce subjective uncertainty by identifying with social groups, which provide clear [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] prescriptions for behaviours and thus imbues people with a positive valence. Some evidence shows that manipulations of subjective uncertainty influence levels of both in-group identification and intergroup bias. For example, a positive relationship has been found between the [[need for closure]] and both in-group identification and intergroup bias (Shah et al. 1998).

==Sociology==
* [[List of sociologists|Sociologists]] termed prejudice an [[adaptation|adaptive]] behaviour. [[Bias]]ed views might be thought needed at times for survival. There is not always enough time to form a legitimate view about a potential foe before adopting a defensive stance that could save lives. Prejudice is non-adaptive when it interferes with survival or well-being.

==Common misconceptions==
At times, the terms prejudice and [[stereotype]] might be confusing:
* Prejudices are abstract-general preconceptions or abstract-general attitudes towards any type of situation, object, or person.
* [[Stereotype]]s are generalizations of existing characteristics that reduce complexity.
