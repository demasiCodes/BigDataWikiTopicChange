In many countries, laws prohibit employers from discriminating on the basis of [[race]], color, [[sex]], [[religion]], national origin, physical or mental [[disability]], or [[ageing|age]]. There is also a growing body of law preventing or occasionally justifying employment [[discrimination]] based on [[sexual orientation]].  Some jurisdictions within countries implement their own non-discrimination laws.

==Protected categories==
Laws can prohibit discrimination on the basis of:
* Race
* Sex
* Pregnancy
* Religion
* National origin
* Citizenship
* Disability (physical, mental, emotional)
* Age
* Sexual Orientation
* Marital status
* Military discharge status
* Anticipated military deployment

==Unintentional discrimination==
Unintentional discrimination (often termed "statistical discrimination") occurs when neutral selection practices produce a substantial disparity of outcomes between one group and another. Such practices include the use of standardized tests (which may disadvantage minority groups) or height (which may disadvantage women and some ethnic groups) in the hiring process. If the requirements are job-related and a "business necessity", the disparity is irrelevant.

Some laws prohibit unintentional discrimination as well as intentional discrimination, but may have different standards for deciding what is acceptable.  Substantial disparities in outcome are not necessarily illegal, if the practices that produce them are necessary.

==Legal protection from employment discrimination==
Many countries have laws prohibiting employment discrimination.
