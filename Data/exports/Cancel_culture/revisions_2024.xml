'''Cancel culture''' is a cultural phenomenon in which an individual thought to have acted or spoken in an unacceptable manner is [[Ostracism|ostracized]], [[boycott]]ed, [[Shunning|shunned]], [[Dismissal (employment)|fired]] or [[Assault|assaulted]], often aided by social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Munro |first=Ealasaid |date=August 23, 2013 |title=Feminism: A Fourth Wave? |url=https://www.psa.ac.uk/psa/news/feminism-fourth-wave |url-status=live |journal=Political Insight |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=22–25 |doi=10.1111/2041-9066.12021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191210124315/https://www.psa.ac.uk/psa/news/feminism-fourth-wave |archive-date=December 10, 2019 |access-date=April 29, 2020 |s2cid=142990260|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Sills |first1=Sophie |last2=Pickens |first2=Chelsea |last3=Beach |first3=Karishma |last4=Jones |first4=Lloyd |last5=Calder-Dawe |first5=Octavia |last6=Benton-Greig |first6=Paulette |last7=Gavey |first7=Nicola |date=March 23, 2016 |title=Rape culture and social media: young critics and a feminist counterpublic |journal=[[Feminist Media Studies]] |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=935–951 |doi=10.1080/14680777.2015.1137962 |s2cid=147023782|hdl=2292/30994 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bromwich 2018" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Yar |first1=Sanam |last2=Bromwich |first2=Jonah Engel |date=October 31, 2019 |title=Tales From the Teenage Cancel Culture |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/style/cancel-culture.html |url-status=live |access-date=July 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200601235105/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/style/cancel-culture.html |archive-date=June 1, 2020 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shunning may extend to social or professional circles{{mdash}}whether on [[social media]] or in person{{mdash}}with most high-profile incidents involving [[Celebrity|celebrities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McDermott |first=John |date=November 2, 2019 |title=Those People We Tried to Cancel?

==Origins==
The 1981 [[Chic (band)|Chic]] album ''[[Take It Off (album)|Take It Off]]'' includes the song "Your Love Is Cancelled", which compares a breakup to the [[cancellation (broadcasting)|cancellation]] of TV shows. The song was written by [[Nile Rodgers]] following a bad date Rodgers had with a woman who expected him to misuse his celebrity status on her behalf. "Your Love Is Cancelled" inspired [[screenwriter]] [[Barry Michael Cooper]] to include a reference to a woman being canceled in the 1991 film ''[[New Jack City]]''.&lt;ref name="mcgrady" /&gt; This usage introduced the term to [[African-American Vernacular English]], where it became more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Webster |first=Elizabeth N. |date=2021-12-24 |title=Cancel Culture Will Not Be Canceled |url=https://medium.com/afrosapiophile/cancel-culture-will-not-be-canceled-22d46f0829c6 |access-date=2022-03-03 |work=[[AfroSapiophile]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic, philosophical, and legal perspectives ==
An article written by [[Pippa Norris]], a professor at Harvard University, states that the controversies surrounding cancel culture are between those who argue it gives a voice to those in marginalized communities and those who argue that cancel culture is dangerous because it prevents free speech and/or the opportunity for open debate. Norris emphasizes the role of social media in contributing to the rise of cancel culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ng |first=Eve |date=2020-07-26 |title=No Grand Pronouncements Here...: Reflections on Cancel Culture and Digital Media Participation |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1527476420918828 |journal=[[Television &amp; New Media]] |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=621–627 |doi=10.1177/1527476420918828 |s2cid=220853829 |issn=1527-4764|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, online communications studies have demonstrated the intensification of cultural wars through activists that are connected through digital and social networking sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bouvier |first1=Gwen |last2=Machin |first2=David |date=2021-04-15 |title=What gets lost in Twitter 'cancel culture' hashtags?

In the book ''[[The Coddling of the American Mind]]'' (2018), social psychologist [[Jonathan Haidt]] and [[Greg Lukianoff]], president of the [[Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression]], argues that call-out culture arises on college campuses from what they term "safetyism"{{mdash}}a moral culture in which people are unwilling to make tradeoffs demanded by the practical or moral concerns of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haidt |first1=Jonathan |author-link1=Jonathan Haidt |last2=Lukianoff |first2=Greg |author-link2=Greg Lukianoff |title=[[The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure]]  |publisher=[[Penguin Press]] |year=2018 |isbn=978-0-7352-2489-6 |location=New York City |oclc=1007552624 }} For ''safetyism'', see {{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9-o6DwAAQBAJ&amp;q=safetyism+call-out+culture  | title = The Coddling of the American Mind | pages = 30, 158, 235, 268, 329| isbn = 978-0-7352-2490-2 | last1 = Lukianoff | first1 = Greg | last2 = Haidt | first2 = Jonathan | date = September 4, 2018 | publisher =[[Penguin Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Campbell |first1=Bradley|last2= Paresky |first2=Pamela |date=June 1, 2020 |title=Safetyism Isn't the Problem |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/opinion/safetyism-coronavirus-reopening.html |access-date=December 20, 2022 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=June 15, 2020|title=Safetyism Isn't the Problem |url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/safetyism-isnt-the-problem.html |publisher=Association for Psychological Science|access-date=December 20, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Keith Hampton]], professor of media studies at [[Michigan State University]], contends that the practice contributes to [[political polarization in the United States]] but does not lead to changes in opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=[[Agence France Presse]] |date=July 22, 2020 |title=La "cancel culture", nouvelle arme des anonymes et facteur de polarisation |url=https://www.journaldemontreal.com/2020/07/22/la-cancel-culture-nouvelle-arme-des-anonymes-et-facteur-de-polarisation |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727073137/https://www.journaldemontreal.com/2020/07/22/la-cancel-culture-nouvelle-arme-des-anonymes-et-facteur-de-polarisation |archive-date=July 27, 2020 |access-date=July 24, 2020 |work=[[Le Journal de Montréal]] |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cancel culture has been described by media studies scholar Eve Ng as "a collective of typically marginalized voices 'calling out' and emphatically expressing their censure of a powerful figure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ng |first=Eve |date=July 26, 2020 |title=No Grand Pronouncements Here&amp;nbsp;...: Reflections on Cancel Culture and Digital Media Participation |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1527476420918828 |volume=21 |issue=16 |pages=621–627 |doi=10.1177/1527476420918828 |access-date=February 12, 2021 |journal=[[Television and New Media]] |s2cid=220853829|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural studies scholar [[Frances E.

Former US Secretary of Labor [[Eugene Scalia]] wrote in a 2021 ''[[Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy]]'' article that cancel culture is a form of free speech, and is therefore protected under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

Ng defines cancel culture as "the withdrawal of any kind of support (viewership, social media follows, purchases of products endorsed by the person, etc.) for those who are assessed to have said or done something unacceptable or highly problematic, generally from a social justice perspective especially alert to sexism, heterosexism, [[homophobia]], racism, bullying, and related issues."&lt;ref&gt;Ng 2020: 623. Ng, E. 2020. “No Grand Pronouncements Here… Reflections on Cancel Culture and Digital Media Participation.” ''Television &amp; New Media''. 21(6): 621-627.&lt;/ref&gt; There are different perspectives on the morality of cancellations. On the one hand, there is the view that cancel culture imposes punishments that are not proportional to the offenses or alleged offenses.&lt;ref&gt;See Norlock, Kathryn J. 2017. “Online Shaming.” ''Social Philosophy Today'' 33: 187-197.[https://philpapers.org/archive/NOROS.pdf] See also Thomason, Krista. 2021. “The Moral Risks of Online Shaming,” in Carissa Véliz, ed., ''The Oxford Handbook of Digital Ethics''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 145-162. [https://philpapers.org/archive/THOTMR-4.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; This is closely related to [[John Stuart Mill]]'s criticism of public shaming: he argued in ''[[On Liberty]]'' that society "practises a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself."&lt;ref&gt;Mill 1991: 9. Mill, J.S. 1991. ''On Liberty and Other Essays''. Edited by Gray, J. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martha Nussbaum]] similarly says that cancel culture represents the "justice of the mob," but this alleged justice is not "deliberative, impartial or neutral."&lt;ref&gt;See Nussbaum 2004: 234. Nussbaum, Martha. 2004. ''Hiding from Humanity: Disgust, Shame, and the Law'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there are those who defend the value of shaming as constructive, if done right; people who defend this view maintain that cancel culture often shames people counter-productively but that it can be tweaked or altered in order to be a valuable tool for people's improvement.&lt;ref&gt;See Campbell 2023. Campbell, Douglas R. 2023. "Cancel Culture, Then and Now: A Platonic Approach to the Shaming of People and the Exclusion of Ideas," ''Journal of Cyberspace Studies'' 7 (2):147-166.[https://philpapers.org/archive/CAMCCT-2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, holding people accountable for things that they have done wrong can be a powerful way of correcting bad behavior, but it has to be paired with a belief in the possibility of redemption.&lt;ref&gt;See, again, Campbell 2023.&lt;/ref&gt; People who take this approach often agree with [[Plato]] that shame is an important feeling that can lead to moral improvements.&lt;ref&gt;Plato's ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'' is a key text in this case. See Tarnopolsky, C (2010). ''Prudes, Perverts, and Tyrants: Plato’s Gorgias and the Politics of Shame''. Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Everyone in this debate agrees that it is important to avoid what Nussbaum calls a "spoiled identity": to have a spoiled identity is to have the public image of someone who is irredeemable and unwelcome in a community.&lt;ref&gt;See Nussbaum 2004: 230, 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===

In July 2020, former U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] criticized cancel culture and "[[woke]]" mentality on [[social media]], saying: "people who do really good stuff have flaws.

A response letter, "A More Specific Letter on Justice and Open Debate", was signed by over 160 people in academia and media. It criticized the ''Harper's'' letter as a plea to end cancel culture by successful professionals with large platforms who wanted to exclude others who have been "canceled for generations". The writers ultimately stated that the ''Harper's'' letter was intended to further silence already marginalized people. They wrote: "It reads as a caustic reaction to a diversifying industry—one that's starting to challenge diversifying norms that have protected bigotry."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Schuessler |first=Jennifer |date=July 10, 2020 |title=An Open Letter on Free Expression Draws a Counterblast |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/arts/open-letter-debate.html |access-date=July 12, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Roberts |first=Mikenzie |date=July 13, 2020 |title=Harper's letter and response signed by Northwestern academics |url=https://dailynorthwestern.com/2020/07/12/campus/northwestern-academics-clash-with-opposing-letters-on-free-speech-cancel-culture/ |access-date= July 18, 2020 |newspaper=[[The Daily Northwestern]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I can think of a number of people in our own time who are being persecuted by supposedly democratic governments for revealing uncomfortable information."&lt;ref name="Coventry 2020"/&gt;}} Another historian, [[David Olusoga]], made a similar argument, and argued that the phenomenon of cancellation is not limited to the left.&lt;ref name="Olusoga 2021"&gt;{{cite news |last=Olusoga|first=David|date=January 3, 2021 |title='Cancel culture' is not the preserve of the left.

Sarah Manavis wrote for the ''[[New Statesman]]'' magazine that while free speech advocates are more likely to make accusations of ''cancel culture'', criticism is part of free speech and rarely results in consequences for those in power who are criticized. She argues that social media is an extension and reincarnation of a longer tradition of expression in a liberal society, "a new space for historical power structures to be solidified" and that online criticism by people who do not hold actual power in society tends not to affect existing power structures. She adds that most prominent people who criticized public opinion as canceling still have highly profitable businesses.&lt;ref name="Manavis 2020"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/2020/07/cancel-culture-does-not-exist|magazine=[[New Statesman]]|date=July 16, 2020|title='Cancel culture' does not exist|first=Sarah|last=Manavis|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200717045438/https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/2020/07/cancel-culture-does-not-exist|archive-date=July 17, 2020|access-date=December 20, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American public opinion ===
A survey conducted in September 2020 on 10,000 Americans by [[Pew Research Center]] asked a series of different questions in regard to cancel culture, specifically on who has heard of the term cancel culture and how Americans define cancel culture.&lt;ref name="Vogels et al. 2021"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vogels |first1=Emily A. |last2=Monica |last3=Erson |last4=Porteus |first4=Margaret |last5=Baronavski |first5=Chris |last6=Atske |first6=Sara |last7=McClain |first7=Colleen |last8=Auxier |first8=Brooke |last9=Perrin |first9=Andrew |date=May 19, 2021 |title=Americans and 'Cancel Culture': Where Some See Calls for Accountability, Others See Censorship, Punishment |url=https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/05/19/americans-and-cancel-culture-where-some-see-calls-for-accountability-others-see-censorship-punishment/ |access-date=December 20, 2022 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, 44% of Americans said that they have at least heard a fair amount about the new phrase, while 22% have heard a great deal and 32% said they have heard nothing at all.&lt;ref name="Vogels et al. 2021" /&gt; 43% Americans aged 18–29 have heard a great deal about cancel culture, compared to only 12% of Americans over the age of 65 who say they have heard a great deal.&lt;ref name="Vogels et al. 2021" /&gt; Additionally, within that same study, the 44% of Americans who had heard a great deal about cancel culture, were then asked how they defined cancel culture. 49% of those Americans state that it describes actions people take to hold others accountable, 14% describe cancel culture as censorship of speech or history, and 12% define it as mean-spirited actions taken to cause others harm.&lt;ref name="Vogels et al. 2021" /&gt; It was found that men were more likely to have heard or know of cancel culture, and that those who identify with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] (46%) are no more likely to know the term than those in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] (44%).&lt;ref name="Vogels et al. 2021" /&gt;

A poll of American registered voters conducted by [[Morning Consult]] in July 2020 showed that cancel culture, defined as "the practice of withdrawing support for (or canceling) public figures and companies after they have done or said something considered objectionable or offensive", was common: 40% of respondents said they had withdrawn support from public figures and companies, including on social media, because they had done or said something considered objectionable or offensive, with 8% having engaged in this often. Behavior differed according to age, with a majority (55%) of voters 18 to 34 years old saying they have taken part in cancel culture, while only about a third (32%) of voters over 65 said they had joined a social media pile-on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lizza |first=Ryan |date=July 22, 2020 |title=Americans tune in to 'cancel culture' — and don't like what they see |url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/22/americans-cancel-culture-377412 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200723040244/https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/22/americans-cancel-culture-377412 |archive-date=July 23, 2020 |access-date=July 22, 2020 |work=[[Politico]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attitude towards the practice was mixed, with 44% of respondents saying they disapproved of cancel culture, 32% who approved, and 24% who did not know or had no opinion.
