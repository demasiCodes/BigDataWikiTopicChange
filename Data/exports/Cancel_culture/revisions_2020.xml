'''Cancel culture''' (or '''call-out culture''') is a [[Ostracism#Modern usage|modern form of ostracism]] in which someone is thrust out of social or professional circles - either online on [[social media]], in the real world, or both. Those who are subject to this ostracism are said to be "canceled."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=McDermott |first=John |date=November 2, 2019 |title=Those People We Tried to Cancel?

A response letter organized by lecturer Arionne Nettles, "A More Specific Letter on Justice and Open Debate," was signed by over 160 people in academia and media and criticized the ''Harper's'' letter as a plea to end cancel culture by successful professionals with large platforms but to exclude others who have been "cancelled for generations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schuessler|first1=Jennifer|date=July 10, 2020|title=An Open Letter on Free Expression Draws a Counterblast|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/arts/open-letter-debate.html|accessdate=July 12, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Roberts|first=Mikenzie|date=July 13, 2020|title=Harper's letter and response signed by Northwestern academics|url=https://dailynorthwestern.com/2020/07/12/campus/northwestern-academics-clash-with-opposing-letters-on-free-speech-cancel-culture/|access-date=July 18, 2020|website=The Daily Northwestern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American public opinion ===
A poll of American registered voters conducted in July 2020 showed that cancel culture, defined as "the practice of withdrawing support for (or canceling) public figures and companies after they have done or said something considered objectionable or offensive," was common: 40% of respondents said they had withdrawn support from public figures and companies, including on social media, because they had done or said something considered objectionable or offensive, 8% having engaged in this often. Behavior differed according to age, with a majority (55%) of voters 18 to 34 years old saying they have taken part in cancel culture, while only about a third (32%) of voters over 65 said they had joined a social media pile-on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Lizza |first=Ryan |date=July 22, 2020 |title=Americans tune in to 'cancel culture' — and don't like what they see |url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/22/americans-cancel-culture-377412 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200723040244/https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/22/americans-cancel-culture-377412 |archive-date=July 23, 2020 |access-date=July 22, 2020 |website=[[POLITICO]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attitude towards the practice was mixed, with 44% of respondents saying they disapproved of cancel culture, 32% who approved, and 24% who did not know or had no opinion. Furthermore, 46% believed cancel culture had gone too far, with only 10% thinking it had not gone far enough. However, a majority (53%) believed that people should expect social consequences for expressing unpopular opinions in public, especially those that may be construed as deeply offensive to other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Morning Consult |authorlink=Morning Consult |last2=Politico |authorlink2=Politico |date=July 2020 |title=National tracking poll, July 17-19, 2020 |url=https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000173-7326-d36e-abff-7ffe72dc0000 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200722192513/https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000173-7326-d36e-abff-7ffe72dc0000 |archive-date=July 22, 2020 |website=Politico.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some journalists question the validity of cancel culture as an actual phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;2020 Jul. 15. “[https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-07-15/not-cancel-culture-its-finally-holding-privileged-people-accountable Letters to the Editor: It’s not ‘cancel culture.’ It’s finally holding privileged people accountable].” ''LA Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2020 Jul. 15. “[https://theprint.in/opinion/no-cancel-culture-isnt-a-threat-to-civilization/461331/ No, cancel culture isn’t a threat to civilization].” ''ThePrint''.

Historian C. J. Coverntry argues that the term has been incorrectly applied, and that it more accurately reflects the propensity of people to hide historical instances of injustice:

{{quotation|While I agree that the line between debate and suppression is one that occasionally gets crossed by the so-called left wing, it is almost invariably true that the real cancel culture is perpetrated by those who have embraced the term. If you look through Australian history, as well as European and American history, you will find countless examples of people speaking out against injustice and being persecuted in return. I can think of a number of people in our own time who are being persecuted by supposedly democratic governments for revealing uncomfortable information.&lt;ref&gt;C. J.
