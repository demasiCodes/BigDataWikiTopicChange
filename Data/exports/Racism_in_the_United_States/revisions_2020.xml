'''Racism in the United States''' has existed since the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial era]] and involves laws, practices, attitudes and actions which discriminate against various groups based on their [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|race or ethnicity]]. Whilst most [[white Americans]] enjoy legally or socially sanctioned privileges and rights, these same privileges and rights can be denied to members of other races and minority groups. [[European Americans]], particularly affluent [[white Anglo-Saxon Protestants]], are said to have enjoyed advantages in matters of education, [[immigration]], voting rights, citizenship, land acquisition, bankruptcy, and criminal procedure throughout [[History of the United States|American history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Loo|first=Rory|date=2009-01-01|title=A Tale of Two Debtors: Bankruptcy Disparities by Race|url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/490|journal=Albany Law Review|volume=72|pages=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|231}}  

Groups especially impacted by racism included non-[[Protestantism|Protestant]] immigrants from [[Europe]], including the [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Poles]], and [[Italians]], who were often subjected to [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] exclusion and other forms of ethnically-based [[discrimination]] in American society until the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Historically, [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics]] have continuously experienced racism in the United States despite the fact that many of them have European ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2018/10/25/latinos-and-discrimination/l|title= Pew Research Center Hispanic Trends; Latinos and discrimination|access-date=20 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Middle Eastern Americans|Middle Eastern]] groups such as [[Jews]], [[Arabs]], and [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]] continuously face discrimination in the United States, and as a result, some people who belong to these groups do not identify as, and are not perceived to be, white. [[African Americans]] faced restrictions on their political, social, and economic freedoms throughout much of [[History of the United States|United States history]]. [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] experienced [[Genocide of indigenous peoples|genocide]], [[Indian removal|forced removals]], [[List of Indian massacres|massacres]], and discrimination.  In addition, [[Asian Americans|East]], [[South Asian Americans|South]], and [[Asian Americans|Southeast]] Asians along with [[Pacific Islander Americans|Pacific Islanders]] have also been discriminated against.&lt;ref name="McClain1994"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McClain |first1=Charles J. |title=In search of equality: the Chinese struggle against discrimination in 19th-century America |url=https://archive.org/details/insearchofequali0000mccl |url-access=registration |date=1994 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=0-520-08337-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Major racially and ethnically structured institutions and manifestations of racism include [[Genocide of indigenous peoples|genocide]], [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], [[Native American reservations]], [[Native American boarding schools]], immigration and [[naturalization]] laws, and [[internment camps]].{{NoteTag|[[Internment camps]] are particularly associated with [[World War II]], but also existed during [[World War I]]. The most significant being the [[Internment of Japanese Americans|internment]] of 120,000 [[Japanese Americans]] during World War II. Additionally, almost 11,000 [[German Americans]] were [[Internment of German Americans|similarly interned]] during World War II, and some [[Italian Americans]] were [[Internment of Italian Americans|also interned]].}} Formal racial discrimination was largely banned by the mid-20th century and over time, it came to be perceived as being socially and morally unacceptable. Racial politics remains a major phenomenon, and [[racism]] continues to be [[Racial inequality in the United States|reflected in socioeconomic inequality]].{{NoteTag|In his 2009 visit to the US, the [UN] Special Rapporteur on Racism noted that "Socio-economic indicators show that [[poverty]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]] and [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]] continue to overlap in the United States.

Some Americans saw the presidential candidacy of [[Barack Obama]], who served as [[president of the United States]] from 2009 to 2017 and was the nation's first [[Black people|black]] president, as a sign that the nation had entered a new, [[Post-racial America|post-racial era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18489466 |title = A New, 'Post-Racial' Political Era in America |website=NPR.org |access-date=2016-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dawson |first1=Michael C. |last2=Bobo|first2=Lawrence D.|year=2009 |title=One Year Later and the Myth of a Post-Racial Society |url = https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/10347165 |journal=Du Bois Review |volume=6 |issue=2 |page = 247 |doi = 10.1017/S1742058X09990282 |access-date=2016-01-01 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The election of President [[Donald Trump]] in 2016, who was a chief proponent of the racist [[birther movement]] in the US (which argued that Obama was not born in the United States) and ran a racially tinged campaign, has been viewed by some commentators as a [[White backlash|racist backlash]] against the election of Barack Obama.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |url = https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/10/the-first-white-president-ta-nehisi-coates/537909/ |title = The First White President |last=Coates |first=Ta-Nehisi |author-link=Ta-Nehisi Coates |date=October 2017 |journal=The Atlantic |access-date=June 29, 2018 |quote=It is often said that Trump has no real ideology, which is not true—his ideology is white supremacy, in all its truculent and sanctimonious power.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before and after the election, Trump has had a history of speech and actions that have been [[Racial views of Donald Trump|widely viewed as racist or racially charged]].

==Racism==
[[Racism]] is a systematized form of [[oppression]] which is developed by members of one [[Race (human categorization)|race]] in order to [[Persecution|persecute]] members of another race. Prejudicial attitudes existed between races for thousands of years, but systematized racial oppression first arose in the 1600s along with [[History of capitalism|capitalism]]; the confluence of the two, capitalism and racial oppression, was deemed ''[[racial capitalism]]''.  Before this period, racism did not exist and in many [[culture]]s, [[Slavery|slaves]] were usually taken as a result of military conquest. But when [[Europe]]an traders discovered that their superior technology gave them a tremendous advantage in [[Africa]], including their sailing ships and firearms, they began to plunder Africa's wealth and take slaves. Slavers and slave owners both tried to justify the practice of slavery by convincing themselves that before their African slaves were captured and enslaved, they had no previous culture and lived like [[Barbarian|savages]], a totally false assumption. White European Americans who participated in the slave industry tried to justify their economic exploitation of [[black people]] by creating a [[Scientific racism|"scientific" theory of white superiority and black inferiority]].&lt;ref name=Boggs&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=41202851 |title=Uprooting Racism and Racists in the United States |last=Boggs |first=James |author-link=James Boggs (activist) |journal=The Black Scholar |publisher=Paradigm Publishers |date=October 1970 |volume=2 |number=2 |pages=2–5|doi=10.1080/00064246.1970.11431000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One such slave owner was [[Thomas Jefferson]], and it was his call for science to determine the obvious "inferiority" of blacks that is regarded as "an extremely important stage in the evolution of scientific racism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garrod |first1=Joel Z.|title=A Brave Old World: An Analysis of Scientific Racism and BiDil |journal=McGill Journal of Medicine |volume=9|issue=1|pages=54–60|pmc=2687899|year=2006|pmid=19529811}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that blacks were "inferior to the whites in the endowments of body and mind."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Finkelman (November 12, 2012).

Such anti-miscegenation laws existed in many states until 1967, when the [[United States Supreme Court]] unanimously ruled in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' that such laws were [[unconstitutional]].

==Citizenship==
The [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] set the first uniform rules for the granting of [[Citizenship of the United States|United States citizenship]] by [[naturalization]], which limited naturalisation to "free white person[s]”, thus excluding from citizenship [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], [[Indentured servitude|indentured servants]], [[History of slavery|slaves]], [[Free Negro|free blacks]] and later [[Asian Americans|Asians]]. Citizenship and the lack of it had special impact on various legal and political rights, most notably [[Voting rights in the United States|suffrage rights]] at both the federal and state level, as well as the right to hold certain government offices, jury duty, military service, and many other activities, besides access to government assistance and services. The second [[Militia Act of 1792]] also provided for the [[conscription]] of every "free able-bodied white male citizen".&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:United States Statutes at Large/Volume 1/2nd Congress/1st Session/Chapter 33|second Militia Act of 1792]]&lt;/ref&gt; Tennessee's 1834 Constitution included a provision: “the free white men of this State have a right to Keep and bear arms for their common defense.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdm15138.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/tfd/id/495/rec/2 |title=Tennessee Constitution, 1834 |access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]], made under the [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830, allowed those [[Choctaw]] Indians who chose to remain in [[Mississippi]] to gain recognition as US citizens, the first major non-European ethnic group to become entitled to US citizenship.

During the [[American Civil War]], as a war necessity, the [[Militia Act of 1862]], for the first time, allowed African-Americans to serve in the Union militias as soldiers and war laborers. By such enrolment, these blacks and their families were freed from slavery, if their owner was a rebel. However, black members were discriminated against in pay, with black members being paid half of white members. Besides discrimination in pay, colored units were often disproportionately assigned laborer work, rather than combat assignments.&lt;ref name=McPherson&gt;James McPherson, ''"The Negro's Civil War"''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|198}} General [[Daniel Ullman]], commander of the [[United States Colored Troops|Corps d'Afrique]], remarked "I fear that many high officials outside of Washington have no other intention than that these men shall be used as diggers and drudges."&lt;ref&gt;Official Record Ser. III Vol. III p. 1126&lt;/ref&gt; Black members were organised into [[United States Colored Troops|colored regiments]]. By the end of that war, in April 1865, there were 175 colored regiments constituting about one-tenth of the [[Union Army]]. About 20% of colored soldiers died, about 35% higher than that of white Union troops. The 1862 Militia Act, however, did not open military service to all races, only to black Americans. Non-whites were not permitted to serve in the Confederate army, except sometimes for camp labor.

The [[Naturalization Act of 1870]] extended naturalization to black persons, but not to other non-white persons, but revoked the citizenship of naturalized Chinese Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wouYAP1oKDsC&amp;pg=PA31 |title=Forbidden Citizens: Chinese Exclusion and the U.S. Congress: A Legislative History| isbn=9781587332524}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law relied on coded language to exclude "aliens ineligible for citizenship" which primarily applied to [[Chinese American|Chinese]] and [[Japanese American|Japanese]] immigrants.

Native Americans were granted citizenship in a piece-meal manner until the [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]], which unilaterally bestowed on them blanket citizenship status, whether they belonged to a federally recognized tribe or not, though by that date two-thirds of Native Americans had already become US citizens by various means. The Act was not retroactive, so that citizenship did not extend to Native Americans born before the effective date of the 1924 Act, or outside of the United States as an indigenous person. Even Native Americans who gained citizenship under the 1924 Act were not guaranteed [[Native American voting rights|voting rights]] until 1948. According to a survey by the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of Interior]], seven states still refused to grant Indians voting rights in 1938. Discrepancies between federal and state control provided loopholes in the Act's enforcement. States justified discrimination based on state statutes and constitutions. Three main arguments for Indian voting exclusion were Indian exemption from real estate taxes, maintenance of tribal affiliation and the notion that Indians were under guardianship, or lived on lands controlled by federal trusteeship.&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peterson |first=Helen L. |date=May 1957|title=American Indian Political Participation |journal=American Academy of Political and Social Science |volume=311|issue=1|pages=116–121 |doi=10.1177/000271625731100113|s2cid=144617127 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 October 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|121}} By 1947, all states with large Indian populations, except [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]], had extended voting rights to Native Americans who qualified under the 1924 Act. Finally, in 1948, a judicial decision forced the remaining states to withdraw their prohibition on Indian voting.&lt;ref name="Bruyneel"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bruyneel |first=Kevin |year=2004 |title=Challenging American Boundaries: Indigenous People and the 'Gift' of U.S. Citizenship |journal=Studies in American Political Development |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=30–43|doi=10.1017/S0898588X04000021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further changes to racial eligibility for citizenship by naturalization were made after 1940, when eligibility was extended to "descendants of races indigenous to the Western Hemisphere," "Filipino persons or persons of Filipino descent," "Chinese persons or persons of Chinese descent," and "persons of races indigenous to India."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coulson |first1=Doug|title=British Imperialism, the Indian Independence Movement, and the Racial Eligibility Provisions of the Naturalization Act: United States v. Thind Revisited |journal=Georgetown Journal of Law &amp; Modern Critical Race Perspectives |date=2015|issue=7|page=2|ssrn=2610266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]] prohibits racial and gender discrimination in naturalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Daniels|first1=Roger|title=Coming to America, A History of Immigration and Ethnicity in American Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizenship, however, did not guarantee any particular rights, such as the right to vote. Black Americans, for example, who gained formal US citizenship by 1870, were subjected to [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] and were soon [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] in the Southern states by through [[Jim Crow laws]].

=== Pre-Civil War ===
[[Slavery]], as a form of [[Unfree labour|forced labor]], has existed in many [[culture]]s, dating back to [[Cradle of civilization|early human civilizations]]. Slavery is not inherently racial ''per se.'' In the [[United States]], however, [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] became [[Racial hierarchy|racialized]] by the time of the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]] (1775–1783), when slavery was widely institutionalized as a racial [[caste]] system which was based on African ancestry and [[Discrimination based on skin color|skin color]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/life/the_history_of_american_slavery/2015/05/why_america_adopted_race_based_slavery.html |title= The Birth of Race-Based Slavery |last=Wood |first=Peter |date=2003 |journal=Slate |id= (May 19, 2015): Reprinted from "Strange New Land: Africans in Colonial America" by Peter H.

Groups of armed white men, called [[slave patrol]]s, were formed to monitor enslaved African Americans. First established in South Carolina in 1704 and spread to other [[slave states]], their function was to police slaves, especially runaways. Slave owners feared slaves might organize a revolt or rebellion, so state militias were formed to provide a military command structure and discipline within the slave patrols to detect, encounter, and crush any organized slave meetings that might lead to revolt or rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Loewen, James W.

==== Steps toward the abolition of slavery ====
[[File:Whippedslaveedit.jpg|thumb|Scars of a whipped slave, April 2, 1863, [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] ]]
During the 1820s and 1830s, the solution of the [[American Colonization Society]] (ACS) to the presence of [[Free Negro|free blacks]] was to persuade them to emigrate to Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcnl.org/issues/item.php?item_id=731&amp;issue_id=75 |title=Background on conflict in Liberia |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108042234/http://www.fcnl.org/issues/item.php?item_id=731&amp;issue_id=75 |archive-date=January 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1821, the ACS established the colony of [[Liberia]], and persuaded thousands of former slaves and free black people to move there. Some slaves were [[manumitted]] (set free) on condition that they emigrate. The slave states made no secret that they wanted to get rid of free blacks, who they believed threatened their investment, the slaves, encouraging escapes and revolts. The support for the ACS was primarily Southern. The founder of the ACS, [[Henry Clay]] of Kentucky, stated that because of "unconquerable prejudice resulting from their color, they never could amalgamate with the free whites of this country. It was desirable, therefore, as it respected them, and the residue of the population of the country, to drain them off".&lt;ref name=ATH&gt;Maggie Montesinos Sale (1997).

Although the “importation” of [[Slavery in the United States|slaves into the United States]] was outlawed by federal law from 1808, the [[Slavery in the United States#Domestic slave trade and forced migration|domestic trade in slaves]] continued to be a major economic activity.&lt;ref name="CUP"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mhJcsiydNe8C&amp;pg=PA20 |page=20|title=Language, Discourse and Power in African American Culture |isbn=9780521001496 |date=2002-07-04 |last1=Morgan |first1=Marcyliena}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maryland and Virginia, for example, would "export" its surplus slaves to the south.

Enslaved family members could be split up (ie., sold off) never to see or hear of each other again.&lt;ref name="CUP" /&gt; Between 1830 and 1840, nearly 250,000 slaves were taken across state lines.&lt;ref name="CUP" /&gt; In the 1850s, more than 193,000 were transported, and historians estimate nearly one million in total were traded.&lt;ref name="CUP" /&gt; Slavery itself was abolished in the 1860s.

The historian [[Ira Berlin]] called this forced migration of slaves the "Second Middle Passage", because it reproduced many of the same horrors as the [[Middle Passage]] (the name given to the transportation of slaves from Africa to North America). These sales of slaves broke up many families, with Berlin writing that whether slaves were directly uprooted or lived in fear that they or their families would be involuntarily moved, "the massive deportation traumatized black people".&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 161–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals lost their connection to families and clans. Added to the earlier colonists combining slaves from different tribes, many ethnic Africans lost their knowledge of varying tribal origins in Africa.

[[File:Crowe-Slaves Waiting for Sale - Richmond, Virginia.jpg|thumb|left|''Slaves Waiting for Sale: Richmond, Virginia''. 1853]]
[[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]]’s [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which came into effect on January 1, 1863, marked a change in the federal government's position on slavery. (Up to that time, the federal government had never even taken a limited pro-emancipation stance, and it could only do so in 1862 because of the 1861 departure of almost all of the Southern members of Congress). Though the proclamation was welcomed by abolitionists, its application had limitations. It did not apply, for example, to the nearly 500,000 slaves in the slave-holding border states of [[Delaware]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maryland]], [[Missouri]], and the new state of [[West Virginia]], and it also did not apply in those portions of some states which were loyal to the Union, such as [[Virginia]]. In those states, slavery remained legal until abolished by [[U.S. state|state]] action, or by the ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] in December 1865.

Lincoln believed that the federal government did not have the authority to abolish slavery; that would violate [[states' rights]]. But he was also Commander of the Armed Forces. An action against states which were in rebellion, a step towards their defeat, was entirely appropriate. The South interpreted it as a hostile act. This allowed Lincoln to abolish slavery to a limited extent, without igniting resistance from anti-abolitionist forces in the Union. None of the slaves who lived outside the border areas were immediately affected, and it was the invading Northern armies which enforced the prohibition.

While personally opposed to slavery (see [[Abraham Lincoln and slavery]]), Lincoln believed that the Constitution did not give Congress the power to end it, stating in his [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address|first Inaugural Address]] that he "had no objection to [this] being made express and irrevocable" via the [[Corwin Amendment]].&lt;ref name="Walter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghostamendment.com/|title=Ghost Amendment: The Thirteenth Amendment That Never Was |last=Walter |first=Michael |year=2003 |access-date=December 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On social and political rights for blacks, Lincoln stated, "I am not, nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people, I as much as any man am in favor of the superior position assigned to the white race."&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Lincoln, "Speeches and Writings 1832–1858: Speeches, Letters, and Miscellaneous Writings : the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, Volume 1". p. 638. Library of America, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The Emancipation Proclamation did not apply to areas which were loyal to, or controlled by, the Union. Slavery was not actually abolished in the U.S. until the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] which was declared ratified on December 6, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/amend1.htm#13 XIII – Slavery Abolished] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819194412/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/amend1.htm |date=August 19, 2016 }} The Avalon Project&lt;/ref&gt;

About four million [[African American|black]] [[slavery in the United States|slaves]] were freed in 1865. 95% of blacks lived in the South, comprising one third of its total population, while only 5% of blacks lived in the North, comprising only 1% of its total population. Consequently, fears of eventual emancipation were much greater in the South than in the North.&lt;ref&gt;James McPherson, Drawn with the Sword, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of males who were aged 13 to 43 died in the Civil War, including 6% in the North and 18% in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/050155.html |title=The Deadliest War |magazine=Harvardmagazine.com |access-date=2013-02-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225020/http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/050155.html |archive-date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the Thirteenth Amendment formally abolished slavery throughout the United States, some black Americans became subjected to revised forms of involuntary labor, particularly in the South, such as [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] that restricted African Americans' freedom, and compelled them to work for low wages. They were also subject to white supremacist violence, and selective enforcement of statutes.

After the Civil War, the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th amendment]] which was passed in 1865, formally abolishing slavery, was ratified. Furthermore, Congress passed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], which broadened a range of civil rights and granted them to all persons who were born in the United States. Despite this, the emergence of "[[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]]", sanctioned acts of subjugation against blacks, continued to bar African-Americans from exercising their due [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]]. The [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] only granted U.S. citizenship to whites, and in 1868 the effort to broaden civil rights was underscored by the passage of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th amendment]] which granted citizenship to blacks.&lt;ref name="Schultz"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schultz|first=Jeffrey D.|title=Encyclopedia of Minorities in American Politics: African Americans and Asian Americans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDV40aK1T-sC&amp;q=African+Americans+discriminated+by+Naturalization+Act+of+1790&amp;pg=PA284|page=284|year=2002|access-date=2015-09-14|isbn=9781573561488}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]] followed, which was eliminated in a decision that undermined federal power to thwart private racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Estreicher|first=Samuel|title=Federal Power to Regulate Private Discrimination: The Revival of the Enforcement Clauses of the Reconstruction Era Amendments|journal=Columbia Law Review|year=1974|volume=74|issue=3|pages=452–454|jstor=112176|doi=10.2307/1121764}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the last of the [[Reconstruction Era]] amendments, the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th amendment]] promised [[voting rights]] to African-American men (previously only white men of property could vote), and these cumulative federal efforts, African-Americans began taking advantage of enfranchisement. African-Americans began voting, seeking office positions, utilizing [[public education]].

By the end of Reconstruction in the mid 1870s, violent [[white supremacist]]s came to power via [[paramilitary group]]s such as the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] and the [[White League]] and imposed [[Jim Crow laws]] which deprived African-Americans of voting rights by instituting systemic and discriminatory policies of unequal [[racial segregation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klarman|first=Michael|title=The Plessy Era|journal=The Supreme Court Review|volume=1998|year=1998|pages=307–308|jstor=3109701|doi=10.1086/scr.1998.3109701|s2cid=147074451}}&lt;/ref&gt; Segregation, which began with slavery, continued with the passage and enforcement of Jim Crow laws, along with the posting of signs which were used to show blacks where they could legally walk, talk, drink, rest, or eat.&lt;ref name="Leon Litwack 2004"&gt;Leon Litwack, ''Jim Crow Blues'', Magazine of History (OAH Publications, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; For those places that were racially mixed, non-whites had to wait until all white customers were dealt with.&lt;ref name="Leon Litwack 2004"/&gt; Segregated facilities extended from white-only schools to white-only graveyards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38536668 "Barack Obama legacy: Did he improve US race relations?"].

The new century saw a hardening of [[institutionalized racism]] and legal discrimination against citizens of African descent in the United States. Throughout the post Civil War period, [[racial stratification]] was informally and systemically enforced, in order to solidify the pre-existing social order. Although they were technically able to vote, [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], pervasive acts of [[terrorism]] such as [[Lynching in the United States|lynchings]] (often perpetrated by [[hate group]]s such as the reborn [[Ku Klux Klan]], founded in the Reconstruction South), and discriminatory laws such as [[grandfather clauses]] kept black Americans (and many [[Poor White]]s) disenfranchised particularly in the South. Furthermore, the discrimination was extended to state legislation which "allocated vastly unequal financial support" for black and white schools. In addition to this, county officials sometimes redistributed resources which were earmarked for blacks to white schools, further undermining educational opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beck|first=E.M.|author2=Tolnay, Stewart |title=Black Flight: Lethal Violence and the Great Migration, 1900–1930|journal=Social Science History|year=1990|volume=14|issue=3|pages=347–370|doi=10.2307/1171355|jstor=1171355}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to de jure racism, protest and lobbyist groups emerged, most notably, the [[NAACP]] (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Anthony Appiah, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., eds.

This era is sometimes referred to as the [[nadir of American race relations]] because racism, [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], [[racial discrimination]], and expressions of [[white supremacy]] all increased. So did anti-black violence, including [[Mass racial violence in the United States|race riots]] such as the [[Atlanta race riot|Atlanta Race riot]] of 1906 and the [[Tulsa race riot]] of 1921. The Atlanta riot was characterized as a "racial massacre of negroes" by the French newspaper ''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6176609/f3.image "Un lynchage monstre"] (September 24, 1906) ''Le Petit Journal''&lt;/ref&gt; The Charleston ''[[The Post and Courier|News and Courier]]'' wrote in response to the Atlanta riots: "Separation of the races is the only radical solution of the negro problem in this country. There is nothing new about it. It was the Almighty who established the bounds of the habitation of the races. The negroes were brought here by compulsion; they should be induced to leave here by persuasion."&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1906/09/30/101799831.pdf "DEPORTING THE NEGROES"] (September 30, 1906) ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Great Migration ===

In addition, racism, which had been viewed as a problem which primarily existed in the [[Southern United States|Southern states]], burst onto the nation's consciousness following the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], the relocation of millions of African Americans from their roots in the rural Southern states to the industrial centers of the North and West between 1910 and 1970, particularly in cities such as [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], [[New York City]] ([[Harlem]]), [[Los Angeles]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Seattle]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], and [[Denver]]. Within Chicago, for example, between 1910 and 1970, the percentage of African-Americans leapt from 2.0 percent to 32.7 percent.&lt;ref name="Tolnay 2003 209–232"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tolnay|first=Stewart|title=The African American 'Great Migration' and Beyond|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|year=2003|volume=29|pages=209–232|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100009|jstor=30036966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demographic patterns of black migrants and external economic conditions are largely studied stimulants regarding the Great Migration.&lt;ref name="Tolnay 2003 209–232"/&gt; For example, migrating blacks (between 1910 and 1920) were more likely to be literate than blacks who remained in the South.

[[File:We want white tenants.jpg|thumb|left|White tenants seeking to prevent blacks from moving into the [[Public housing in Detroit|housing project]] erected this sign. Detroit, 1942.]]
Southern migrants were often treated in accordance with pre-existing racial stratification. The rapid influx of blacks into the North and West disturbed the racial balance within cities, exacerbating hostility between both black and white residents in the two regions. Stereotypic schemas of Southern blacks were used to attribute issues in urban areas, such as crime and disease, to the presence of African-Americans. Overall, African-Americans in most Northern and Western cities experienced systemic discrimination in a plethora of aspects of life. Within employment, economic opportunities for blacks were routed to the lowest-status and restrictive in potential mobility. In 1900 Reverend Matthew Anderson, speaking at the annual [[Hampton Negro Conference]] in Virginia, said that "...the lines along most of the avenues of wage earning are more rigidly drawn in the North than in the South. There seems to be an apparent effort throughout the North, especially in the cities to debar the colored worker from all the avenues of higher remunerative labor, which makes it more difficult to improve his economic condition even than in the South."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual Report of the Hampton Negro Conference|chapter=The Economic Aspect of the Negro Problem|first=Anderson|last=Matthew|editor1-last=Browne |editor1-first=Hugh |editor2-last=Kruse |editor2-first=Edwina |editor4-last=Moton |editor3-last=Walker |editor3-first=Thomas C. |editor4-first=Robert Russa |editor4-link=Robert Russa Moton |editor5-last=Wheelock |editor5-first=Frederick D. |publisher=Hampton Institute Press|location=[[Hampton, Virginia]]|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gkQ9AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA39|hdl=2027/chi.14025588?urlappend=%3Bseq=43|volume=4|year=1900|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Occupational Changes Among Negroes in Chicago|first=Estelle Hill|last=Scott|publisher=[[Works Progress Administration|Work Projects Administration]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XHQG6Tdfr1QC&amp;pg=PA91|hdl=2027/uiug.30112046302813?urlappend=%3Bseq=137|year=1939|page=91|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/occupationalchan00unit/page/n217/mode/1up|archive-date=2010-05-06| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the housing market, stronger discriminatory measures were used in correlation to the influx, resulting in a mix of "targeted violence, [[restrictive covenants]], [[redlining]] and racial steering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tolnay|first=Stewart|title=The African American 'Great Migration' and Beyond|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|year=2003|volume=29|pages=218–221|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100009|jstor=30036966}}&lt;/ref&gt; A club central to the [[Harlem Renaissance]] in the 1920s, the [[Cotton Club]] in Harlem, New York City, was a whites-only establishment, with black acts allowed to perform, but to a white audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ella Fitzgerald |date=1989 |publisher=Holloway House Publishing |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] have lived on the North American continent for at least 10,000 years and millions of Native Americans were living in what is today the United States at the time European settlers first arrived on it.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Charles C., ''1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus'', Vintage Books, 2006, c.2005, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; During the colonial and independent periods, European settlers waged a long series of conflicts, often with the objective of obtaining the resources of Native Americans. Through [[List of wars|wars]], [[population transfer|forced displacement]] (such as the [[Trail of Tears]]), and the imposition of treaties, land was taken. The loss of land often resulted in hardships for Native Americans. In the early 18th century, the English had enslaved nearly 800 Choctaws.&lt;ref name=brescia_era&gt;{{cite book| last = Brescia | first = William (Bill) | title = Tribal Government, A New Era | publisher = Choctaw Heritage Press | location = Philadelphia, Mississippi | chapter = Chapter 2, French-Choctaw Contact, 1680s–1763 | page = 8 | year = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the creation of the United States, the idea of [[Indian removal]] gained momentum. However, some Native Americans chose to or were allowed to remain and avoided removal and thereafter were subjected to official racism. The Choctaws in [[Mississippi]] described their situation in 1849, "we have had our habitations torn down and burned, our fences destroyed, cattle turned into our fields and we ourselves have been scourged, manacled, fettered and otherwise personally abused, until by such treatment some of our best men have died."&lt;ref name=peterson&gt;{{cite book| last = Walter | first = Williams | title = Southeastern Indians: Since the Removal Era | publisher = University of Georgia Press | location = Athens, Georgia | chapter = Three Efforts at Development among the Choctaws of Mississippi | year = 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph B. Cobb, who moved to Mississippi from Georgia, described the Choctaws as having "no nobility or virtue at all," and in some respect he found blacks, especially native Africans, to be more interesting and admirable, the red man's superior in every way. The Choctaw and Chickasaw, the tribes he knew best, were beneath contempt, that is, even worse than black slaves.&lt;ref name=charles_hudson&gt;{{cite book | last = Hudson | first = Charles | title = Red, White, and Black; Symposium on Indians in the Old South | publisher = University of Georgia Press | chapter = The Ante-Bellum Elite | page = 80 | id = SBN 820303089| year = 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1800s, ideologies such as [[Manifest destiny]], which held the view that the United States was destined to expand from coast to coast on the North American continent, fueled U.S. attacks against, and maltreatment of, Native Americans. In the years leading up to the [[Indian Removal Act |Indian Removal Act of 1830]] there were many armed conflicts between settlers and Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Worlds Together, Worlds Apart, Robert Tignor, Jeremy Adelman, Stephen Aron, Stephen Kotkin, Suzanne Marchand, Gyan Prakash, Michael Tsin, W.W.

An egregious attempt occurred with the [[California gold rush]], the first two years of which saw the death of thousands of Native Americans. Under [[Alta California|Mexican rule in California]], Indians were subjected to ''de facto'' enslavement under a system of [[peon]]age by the white elite.

Native American nations on the plains in the west continued armed conflicts with the U.S. throughout the 19th century, through what were called generally [[American Indian Wars|Indian Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9iQYSQ9y60MC |isbn=978-0-8061-2220-5 |page=48|title=American Indian Holocaust and Survival: A Population History Since 1492 |year=1990 |last1=Thornton |first1=Russell }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable conflicts in this period include the [[Dakota War of 1862|Dakota War]], [[Great Sioux War of 1876|Great Sioux War]], [[Snake War]] and [[Colorado War]]. In the years leading up to the [[Wounded Knee massacre]] the U.S. government had continued to seize [[Lakota people|Lakota]] lands. A [[Ghost Dance]] ritual on the Northern Lakota reservation at Wounded Knee, [[South Dakota]], led to the U.S. Army's attempt to subdue the Lakota. The dance was part of a religion founded by [[Wovoka]] that told of the return of the Messiah to relieve the suffering of Native Americans and promised that if they would live righteous lives and perform the Ghost Dance properly, the European American invaders would vanish, the bison would return, and the living and the dead would be reunited in an Edenic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plains Humanities: Wounded Knee Massacre|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.war.056|access-date=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 29, 1890, at Wounded Knee, gunfire erupted, and U.S. soldiers killed up to 300 Indians, mostly old men, women and children.&lt;ref name="Wounded Knee"&gt;{{cite web|title=Plains Humanities: Wounded Knee Massacre|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.war.056|access-date=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period surrounding the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre, author [[L. Frank Baum]] wrote two editorials about Native Americans. Five days after the killing of the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] [[Sioux]] [[Medicine man|holy man]], [[Sitting Bull]], Baum wrote, "The proud spirit of the original owners of these vast prairies inherited through centuries of fierce and bloody wars for their possession, lingered last in the bosom of Sitting Bull. With his fall the nobility of the [[Redskin]] is extinguished, and what few are left are a pack of whining curs who lick the hand that smites them. The Whites, by the law of conquest, by a justice of civilization, are masters of the American continent, and the best safety of the frontier settlements will be secured by the total annihilation of the few remaining Indians. Why not annihilation? Their glory has fled, their spirit broken, their manhood effaced; better that they die than live the miserable wretches that they are."&lt;ref name="editorials"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northern.edu/hastingw/baumedts.htm |title=L.

Having wronged them for centuries we had better, in order to protect our civilization, follow it up by one more wrong and wipe these untamed and untamable creatures from the face of the earth. In this lies safety for our settlers and the soldiers who are under incompetent commands.

=== Reservation marginalization ===
{{See also|Native American reservations}}
Once their territories were incorporated into the United States, surviving Native Americans were denied equality before the law and often treated as wards of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Many Native Americans were moved to reservations—constituting 4% of U.S. territory. In a number of cases, treaties signed with Native Americans were violated. Tens of thousands of American Indians and Alaska Natives were forced to attend a [[Indian boarding school|residential school system]] which sought to reeducate them in white settler American values, culture and economy.&lt;ref&gt;Ward Churchill, ''Kill the Indian, Save the Man'', 2006. The basis for this theory was that inside every native person, there was a repressed white person screaming to come to the surface. Abuse both physical and psychological was common in these schools, and often their objective of 'compulsory whiteness' was not even ultimately achieved, with many of the Indians who later returned to the reservations afterwards not at all 'becoming white', but instead simply becoming heavy alcoholics and displaying signs of permanent psychological distress, and even [[mental illness]]. Further, these individuals were often either totally unemployable or only marginally employed, as it was sensed by those around them that on the one hand, they had not successfully assimilated into 'white society', nor were they any longer acceptable to the Indian societies from which they had originated.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/world_news_america/9097996.stm | work=BBC News | first1=Franz | last1=Strasser | first2=Sharon | last2=Carpenter | title=Native Americans battle teenage suicide | date=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further dispossession of various kinds continues into the present, although these current dispossessions, especially in terms of land, rarely make major news headlines in the country (e.g., the [[Lenape]] people's recent fiscal troubles and subsequent land grab by the [[State of New Jersey]]), and sometimes even fail to make it to headlines in the localities in which they occur. Through concessions for industries such as oil, mining and timber and through division of land from the [[Allotment Act]] forward, these concessions have raised problems of consent, exploitation of low royalty rates, environmental injustice, and gross mismanagement of funds held in trust, resulting in the loss of $10–40&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;United States Senate, [http://www.indiantrust.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=OtherMedia.ViewDetail&amp;Other_id=12&amp;Month=3&amp;Year=2007 Oversight Hearing on Trust Fund Litigation, Cobell v.

The Naturalization Act of 1790 limited citizenship to whites only. The [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]] granted U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans. Prior to the passage of the act, nearly two-thirds of Native Americans were already U.S. citizens.&lt;ref name=2-3_us_citizenship&gt;{{cite web

The [[Jim Crow Laws]] were state and local laws which were enacted in the [[Southern United States|Southern]] and [[Border states (Civil War)|border states]] of the United States and enforced between 1876 and 1965. They mandated "[[separate but equal]]" status for blacks. In reality, this led to treatment and accommodations that were almost always inferior to those which were provided to whites. The most important laws required that public schools, public places and public transportation, like trains and buses, have separate facilities for whites and blacks. State-sponsored school segregation was declared unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1954 in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''. One of the first federal court cases which challenged segregation in schools was [[Mendez v. Westminster]] in 1946.

By the 1950s, the [[Civil Rights Movement]] was gaining momentum. Membership in the NAACP increased in states across the U.S. A 1955 lynching that sparked public outrage about injustice was that of [[Emmett Till]], a 14-year-old boy from Chicago. Spending the summer with his relatives in [[Money, Mississippi]], Till was killed for allegedly having [[wolf-whistle]]d at a white woman. Till had been badly beaten, one of his eyes was gouged out, and he was shot in the head before being thrown into the [[Tallahatchie River]], his body weighed down with a {{convert|70|lbs|kg|adj=on}} [[cotton gin]] fan tied around his neck with barbed wire. David Jackson writes that [[Mamie Till]], Emmett's Mother, "brought him home to Chicago and insisted on an open casket. Tens of thousands filed past Till's remains, but it was the publication of the searing funeral image in ''Jet'', with a stoic Mamie gazing at her murdered child's ravaged body, that forced the world to reckon with the brutality of American racism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://100photos.time.com/photos/emmett-till-david-jackson|title=How The Horrific Photograph of Emmett Till Helped Energize The Civil Rights Movement|website=100 Photographs {{!}} The Most Influential Images of All Time|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; News photographs circulated around the country, and drew intense public reaction.

In response to heightening discrimination and violence, non-violent acts of protest began to occur. For example, in February 1960, in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], four young African-American college students entered a Woolworth store and sat down at the counter but were refused service. The men had learned about non-violent protest in college, and continued to sit peacefully as whites tormented them at the counter, pouring ketchup on their heads and burning them with cigarettes. After this, many sit-ins took place in order to non-violently protest against racism and inequality. Sit-ins continued throughout the South and spread to other areas. Eventually, after many sit-ins and other non-violent protests, including marches and boycotts, places began to agree to desegregate.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Berkin, Christopher Miller, Robert Cherny, James Gormly (2011).

In June 1963, civil rights activist and [[NAACP]] member [[Medgar Evers]] was assassinated by [[Byron De La Beckwith]], a member of the [[White Citizens' Council]]. In his trials for murder De La Beckwith evaded conviction via all-white juries (both trials ended with hung juries).

The [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]] marked a turning point during the Civil Rights Era. On Sunday, September 15, 1963 with a stack of dynamite hidden on an outside staircase, Ku Klux Klansmen destroyed one side of the Birmingham church. The bomb exploded in proximity to twenty-six children who were preparing for choir practice in the basement assembly room.

With the bombing occurring only a couple of weeks after [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], it became an integral aspect of transformed perceptions of conditions for blacks in America. It influenced the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] (that banned discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and labor unions) and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] which overruled remaining Jim Crow laws. Nonetheless, neither had been implemented by the end of the 1960s as civil rights leaders continued to strive for political and social freedom.

Segregation continued even after the demise of the Jim Crow laws.

Although in the U.S. informal discrimination and segregation have always existed, redlining began with the [[National Housing Act of 1934]], which established the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA). The practice was fought first through passage of the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]] (which prevents redlining when the criteria for redlining are based on race, religion, gender, familial status, disability, or ethnic origin), and later through the [[Community Reinvestment Act]] of 1977, which requires banks to apply the same lending criteria in all communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0813339529 |isbn=978-0-8133-3952-8 |page=114 |quote=The goal was not to relax lending restrictions but rather to get banks to apply the same criteria in the inner-city as in the [[suburbs]].|title=Comeback Cities: A Blueprint for Urban Neighborhood Revival |date=2001-12-18 |last1=Grogan |first1=Paul |last2=Proscio |first2=Tony }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although redlining is illegal some argue that it continues to exist in other forms.

From 1981 to 1997, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] discriminated against tens of thousands of black American farmers, denying loans that were provided to white farmers in similar circumstances.

During the 1980s and '90s, a number of riots occurred that were related to longstanding racial tensions between police and minority communities. The [[1980 Miami riots]] were catalyzed by the killing of an African-American motorist by four white [[Miami-Dade Police]] officers. They were subsequently acquitted on charges of manslaughter and evidence tampering. Similarly, the six-day [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] erupted after the acquittal of four white [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers who had been filmed beating [[Rodney King]], an African-American motorist.

White women calling the police on blacks has become more publicized in recent years. In a 2020 article in ''The New York Times'' titled ''How White Women Use Themselves as Instruments of Terror'', black columnist Charles M. Blow wrote, “historically, white women have used the violence of white men and the institutions these men control as their own muscle. Untold numbers of lynchings were executed because white women had claimed that a black man raped, assaulted, talked to or glanced at them.

Also, the 1879 constitution delegated the local governments of California the power to remove Chinese people from the borders of their localities.&lt;ref name="archives.cdn.sos.ca.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hitler's American Model 2017 p. 35"/&gt; The [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] banning immigration of Chinese people was enacted on the national level in 1882, while the immigration of people from Asian countries in addition to China was banned by the sweeping [[Immigration Act of 1917]], also known as the Asiatic Barred Zone Act, which also banned [[homosexual]]s, people with [[intellectual disability]], and people with an [[anarchist]] worldview.&lt;ref name="Hitler's American Model 2017 p. 35"/&gt; The Chinese Exclusion Act was the first time that a law was passed to exclude a major ethnic group from the nation.&lt;ref name="Eguchi, Shinsuke 2013" /&gt;

Several massacres of Chinese people, including the [[Rock Springs massacre]] of 1885 and the [[Hells Canyon massacre]] of 1887 further exemplified deep American racist animus against Chinese people.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

[[File:1880 Anti-Chinese Riot in Denver anagoria.JPG|thumb|upright|Denver's anti-Chinese riot in 1880]]

Local discriminatory laws were also enacted to stifle Chinese business and job opportunities; for example, in the 1886 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Yick Wo v. Hopkins]]'', a San Francisco city ordinance requiring permits for laundries (which were mostly Chinese-owned) was struck down, as it was evident the law solely targeted Chinese Americans. When the law was in effect, the city issued permits to virtually all non-Chinese permit applicants, while only granting one permit out of two hundred applications from Chinese laundry owners. When the Chinese laundries continued to operate, the city tried to fine the owners. In 1913, California, home to many Chinese immigrants, enacted an [[California Alien Land Law of 1913|Alien Land Law]], which significantly restricted land ownership by Asian immigrants, and [[California Alien Land Law of 1920|extended it]] in 1920, ultimately banning virtually all land ownership by Asians.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sakamoto | first1 = Taylor | year = 2007 | title = The Triumph and Tragedies of Japanese Women in America: A View Across Four Generations | journal = History Teacher | volume = 41 | issue = 1| pages = 97–122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese immigrants, who were unaffected by the Chinese Exclusion Act, began to enter the United States in large numbers in 1907, filling jobs that were once filled by Chinese workers. This influx also led to discrimination and [[Theodore Roosevelt|President Theodore Roosevelt]] restricted Japanese immigration. Later, Japanese immigration was closed when Japan entered into the [[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907]] to stop issuing passports to Japanese workers intending to move to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eguchi | first1 = Shinsuke | year = 2013 | title = Revisiting Asia centricity: Toward Thinking Dialectically about Asian American Identities and Negotiation | journal = Howard Journal of Communications | volume = 24 | issue = 1| pages = 95–115 | doi=10.1080/10646175.2013.748556| s2cid = 54718287 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] was an ally of the United States, and the federal government praised the resistance of the Chinese against Japan in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], in an attempt to reduce [[Sinophobia|anti-Chinese sentiment]]. In 1943, the [[Magnuson Act]] was passed by Congress, repealing the Chinese Exclusion Act and reopening Chinese immigration. However, at the time, the United States was actively fighting the [[Empire of Japan]], which was a member of the [[Axis powers]]. [[Anti-Japanese sentiment|Anti-Japanese racism]], which spiked after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], was tacitly encouraged by the government, which used slurs such as "[[Jap]]" in propaganda posters and even [[Internment of Japanese Americans|interned Japanese Americans]], citing possible security threats. American soldiers in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]] often dehumanized their enemy, leading them to [[American mutilation of Japanese war dead|mutilate Japanese war dead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-5-JeCa2Z7hN2ZkMWRiNmYtN2M4Ny00YjQ2LWJlMjYtZGY0NmMxMzM5NzQ2/view?ddrp=1&amp;hl=en&amp;pli=1&amp;usp=embed_facebook|title=Trophies of War, US Troops and the Mutilation of Japanese War Dead, 1941-1945 - James J Weingartner - PHR Vol 61 No 1 Feb 1992.pdf|website=Google Docs|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The racist nature of this dehumanization is apparent in the inconsistency of the treatment of corpses in the Pacific and the European theaters.

Prior to 1965, Indian immigration to the U.S. was small and isolated, with fewer than 50,000 Indian immigrants in the country. The [[Bellingham riots]] in [[Bellingham, Washington]], on September 5, 1907, epitomized the low tolerance in the U.S. for Indians and [[Hindu]]s. While anti-Asian racism was embedded in U.S. politics and culture in the early 20th century, Indians were also racialized, with U.S. officials casting them as "Hindu menaces" and pushing for Western imperial expansion abroad.&lt;ref name="Seema"&gt;{{cite book|first=Seema|last=Sohi|title=Echoes of Mutiny: Race, Surveillance, and Indian Anticolonialism in North America|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-937625-4|page=8 |quote=Indians in North America, nearly 90 percent of whom where Sikhs from the state of Punjab, were also racialized through colonial gendered discourses.

The [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional [[Northern European]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic groups]], and as a result, it would significantly, and unintentionally, alter the demographic mix in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Immigration law"&gt;{{cite web |title= 1965 immigration law changed face of America |first=Jennifer |last=Ludden |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5391395 |publisher=NPR |access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the U.S. immigration laws prior to 1965, sociologist [[Stephen Klineberg]] stated the law "declared that Northern Europeans are a superior subspecies of the white race."&lt;ref name="Immigration law"/&gt; In 1990, Asian immigration was encouraged when nonimmigrant temporary working visas were given to help with the shortage of skilled labor within the United States.&lt;ref name="Eguchi, Shinsuke 2013" /&gt;

In modern times, Asians have been perceived as a "[[model minority]]". They are categorized as more educated and successful, and are stereotyped as intelligent and hard-working, but socially inept.&lt;ref name="Lai, Lei 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lai | first1 = Lei | last2 = Babcock | first2 = Linda C. | year = 2013 | title = Asian Americans and Workplace Discrimination: The Interplay between Sex of Evaluators and the Perception of Social Skills | journal = Journal of Organizational Behavior | volume = 34 | issue = 3| pages = 310–26 | doi=10.1002/job.1799}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asians may experience expectations of natural intelligence and excellence from whites as well as other minorities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = Isok | year = 2014 | title = The Role of Critical Ethnic Awareness and Social Support in the discrimination–depression Relationship among Asian Americans: Path Analysis | journal = Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 52–60 | doi=10.1037/a0034529| pmid = 24491128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to discrimination in the workplace, as Asian Americans may face unreasonable expectations because of this stereotype. According to the Journal of Organizational Behavior, in 2000, out of 1,218 adult Asian Americans, 92 percent of those who experienced personal discrimination believed that the unfair treatment was due to their ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Lai, Lei 2013" /&gt;

These stereotypes can also obstruct career paths; because Asians are seen as better skilled in engineering, computing, and mathematics, they are often encouraged to pursue technical careers. They are also discouraged from pursuing non-technical occupations or executive occupations requiring more social interaction, since Asians are perceived to have poor social skills. In the 2000 study, forty percent of those surveyed who experienced discrimination believed that they had lost hiring or promotion opportunities. In 2007, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] reported that Asians make up 10 percent of professional jobs, while 3.7 percent of them held executive, senior level, or manager positions.&lt;ref name="Lai, Lei 2013" /&gt;

Other forms of discrimination against Asian Americans include racial profiling and hate crimes. The FBI noted that in 2015, 3.2 percent of all hate crimes involved anti-Asian bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2015/topic-pages/victims_final|title=Victims|website=FBI|access-date=2018-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the [[Seattle]] Police Department reported that there was a 40 percent increase in race-based crimes against Asian-Americans, both criminal and non-criminal.&lt;ref&gt;Kebba, Michael T. Bias Crimes and Incidents Synopsis. Seattle: Seattle Police Department Memorandum, 2016. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that discrimination has led to more use of informal mental health services by Asian Americans. Asian Americans who feel discriminated against also tend to smoke more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chae | first1 = David H. | display-authors = etal | year = 2008 | title = Unfair Treatment, Racial/Ethnic Discrimination, Ethnic Identification, and Smoking among Asian Americans in the National Latino and Asian American Study | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 98 | issue = 3| pages = 485–92 | doi=10.2105/ajph.2006.102012 | pmid=18235073 | pmc=2253562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[European Americans|European American]] immigrant groups have been subjected to discrimination on the basis of their [[religion]] (see [[Religious discrimination in the United States]] and [[Anti-Catholicism in the United States]]), immigrant status (which is known as "[[Nativism (politics)|Nativism]]") or ethnicity (country of origin).
[[File:Philadelphia1844riot.jpg|thumb|[[Philadelphia nativist riots|Philadelphia Nativist riots]].]]
[[File:NINA-nyt.JPG|thumb|''[[New York Times]]'', 1854 ad, reading "No Irish need apply."]]
In the 19th century, this was particularly true because of [[Anti-Irish sentiment|anti-Irish prejudice]], which was based on [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] sentiment, and prejudice against the Irish as an ethnicity. This was especially true for Irish Catholics who immigrated to the U.S. in the mid-19th century; the large number of Irish (both Catholics and Protestants) who settled in America in the 18th century had largely (but not entirely) escaped such discrimination and eventually blended into the white American population. During the 1830s in the U.S., riots over control of job sites broke out in rural areas among rival labor teams whose members were from different parts of Ireland, and riots also broke out between Irish and local American work teams which were competing for construction jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Prince, Carl E.

The Native American Party, commonly called the [[Know Nothing]] movement was a political party, whose membership was limited to Protestant men, that operated on a national basis during the mid-1850s and sought to limit the influence of Irish Catholics and other immigrants, thus reflecting nativism and anti-Catholic sentiment. There was widespread anti-Irish job discrimination in the United States and "No Irish need apply" signs were common.&lt;ref&gt;Fried, Rebecca A.

{{further|Nordicism#In the United States}}
The 20th century saw discrimination against immigrants from southern and eastern Europe (notably Italian Americans and [[Polish Americans]]), partly from anti-Catholic sentiment (as well as discrimination against Irish Americans), and partly from [[Nordicism]]. The primary spokesman for Nordicism was the eugenicist [[Madison Grant]]. His 1916 book, ''[[The Passing of the Great Race|The Passing of the Great Race, or the Racial Basis of European History]]'' about Nordicism was highly influential among racial thinking and government policy making in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guterl|first=Matthew Pratt|author-link=Matthew Pratt Guterl|title=''The Color of Race in America, 1900–1940''|year=2004|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=USA|isbn=978-0-674-01012-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/colorofraceiname0000gute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An advocate of the U.S. immigration laws that favored Northern Europeans, the Klansman [[Lothrop Stoddard]] wrote primarily on the alleged dangers posed by "[[colored]]" peoples to white civilization, with his most famous book ''[[The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy]]'' in 1920. Nordicism led to the reduction in Southern European, along with [[Slavs|Slavic]] Eastern European and Russian immigrants in the [[National Origins Formula]] of the [[Emergency Quota Act]] of 1921 and the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], whose goal was to maintain the status quo distribution of ethnicity by limiting immigration of non-Northern Europeans. According to the U.S. Department of State the purpose of the act was "to preserve the ideal of American homogeneity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1921-1936/immigration-act | work=U.S. Department of State Office of the Historian | title=The Immigration Act of 1924 (The Johnson-Reed Act) | access-date=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The racial term ''[[Untermensch]]'' originates from the title of Stoddard's 1922 book ''The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under-man''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Stoddard, Lothrop| author-link = Lothrop Stoddard| year = 1922| title = The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under Man| publisher = [[Charles Scribner's Sons]]| location = New York| url = https://archive.org/details/revoltagainstciv00stoduoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later adopted by the Nazis (and its chief racial theorist [[Alfred Rosenberg]]) from that book's German version ''Der Kulturumsturz: Die Drohung des Untermenschen'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;

There was also discrimination against [[German Americans]] and Italian Americans due to Germany and Italy being enemy countries during [[World War I]] (Germany) and [[World War II]] (Germany and Italy). This resulted in a sharp decrease in German-American ethnic identity and a sharp decrease in the use of [[German in the United States]] following World War I, which had hitherto been significant, and the [[German American internment|internment of German]] and [[Italian American internment|Italian Americans]] during World War II; see also [[German American#World War I anti-German sentiment|World War I anti-German sentiment]].

Beginning in World War I, German Americans were sometimes accused of having political allegiances to Germany rather than the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlham.edu/%7Edominel/obituary.htm Hugo Münsterberg's obituary].&lt;/ref&gt; The Justice Department attempted to prepare a list of all German aliens, counting approximately 480,000 of them, more than 4,000 of whom were imprisoned in 1917–18.

Specific racism against other European-American ethnicities significantly diminished as a political issue in the 1930s, being replaced by a bi-racialism of black/white, as described and predicted by [[Lothrop Stoddard]], due to numerous causes. The National Origins Formula significantly reduced inflows of non-Nordic ethnicities; the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] (of African-Americans out of the South) displaced anti-white immigrant racism with anti-black racism.&lt;ref name="Migration"/&gt;

Americans of [[Latin America]]n ancestry (often categorized as "[[Hispanic]]" or [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]) come from a wide variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds. As a result, not all Latinos are distinguishable as members of a single racial minority.

After the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846–1848), the United States annexed much of the current [[Southwestern United States|Southwestern region]] from [[Mexico]]. Mexicans who resided in that territory were subjected to discrimination. It is estimated that at least 597 Mexicans were lynched between 1848 and 1928 (this is a conservative estimate due to the fact that there was a lack of records when many reported lynchings were committed). Between 1880 and 1930, Mexicans were lynched at a rate of 27.4 per 100,000 people. This lynching statistic is second only to the statistic within the African American community, which suffered an average of 37.1 lynchings per 100,000 people during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_mXXvWYO-sC&amp;q=lynching+mexicans+in+the+us+in+1800s&amp;pg=PA135|title=Encyclopedia of the Mexican American Civil Rights Movement|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|date=2000|first1=Matt S. |last1=Meier |first2=Margo |last2=Gutierrez |isbn=9780313304255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1848 and 1879, Mexicans were lynched at an unprecedented rate of 473 per 100,000 people.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2005/is_2_37/ai_111897839/pg_9 |title=The lynching of persons of Mexican origin or descent in the United States, 1848 to 1928 &amp;#124; Journal of Social History &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET.com |publisher=Findarticles.com |access-date=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Great Depression]], the U.S. government sponsored a [[Mexican Repatriation]] program which was intended to encourage Mexican immigrants to voluntarily return to Mexico, however, many were forcibly removed against their will. In total, up to one million persons of Mexican ancestry were deported, approximately 60 percent of those individuals were actually U.S. citizens.

The [[Zoot Suit riots]] were vivid incidents of racial violence against Latinos (e.g., [[Mexican-Americans]]) in Los Angeles in 1943. Naval servicemen who were stationed in a Latino neighborhood clashed with youths who lived in the dense neighborhood. Frequent confrontations between small groups and individuals had intensified and erupted into several days of non-stop rioting. Large mobs of servicemen would enter civilian quarters looking to attack Mexican American youths, some of whom were wearing [[zoot suit]]s, a distinctive and exaggerated style of fashion which was popular among members of that age group.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Griswold del Castillo, "The Los Angeles "Zoot Suit Riots" Revisited: Mexican and Latin American Perspectives," ''Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos'', Vol. 16, No. 2.

Many public institutions, businesses, and homeowners associations officially excluded [[Mexican Americans]] as a matter of policy. School children of Mexican American descent were subjected to racial segregation in the public school system. In many counties, Mexican Americans were excluded from serving as jurors in court cases, especially in those that involved Mexican American defendants. In many areas across the Southwest, they lived in separate residential areas, due to laws and real estate company policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/osi04.soc.ush.civil.mendez/ |title=Teachers' Domain: Mendez v.

People of Middle Eastern and South Asian descent historically occupied an ambiguous racial status in the United States. Middle Eastern and South Asian immigrants were among those who sued in the late 19th and early 20th century to determine whether they were "white" immigrants as required by naturalization law. By 1923, courts had vindicated a "common-knowledge" standard, concluding that "scientific evidence", including the notion of a "[[Caucasian race]]" including Middle Easterners and many South Asians, was incoherent. Legal scholar John Tehranian argues that in reality this was a "performance-based" standard, relating to religious practices, education, intermarriage and a community's role in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;John Tehranian, "Performing Whiteness: Naturalization Litigation and the Construction of Racial Identity in America," ''[[The Yale Law Journal]]'', Vol. 109, No. 4.

Religious racialization conflates Arabs and Islam, and consequently positions all Arabs as Muslim; represents Islam as a monolithic religion erasing diversity among Arabs and Muslims; and marks Islam as a backwards, fanatical, uncivilized, and a terroristic belief system" (p. 127). "Whereas before September 11, Arab- and Muslim-Americans were not included in discourses on race and racism in the United States, a public discourse emerged after September 11 on whether Arabs and Muslims were being treated fairly or being subjected to racism with the rise in hate crimes and government measures targeting Arabs and Muslims" (p. 141). {{Cite book | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] | isbn = 978-0-415-37542-9 |editor1= Zahia Smail Salhi |editor2=Ian Richard Netton | last = Alsultany | first = Evelyn | title = The Arab diaspora: Voices of an anguished scream | chapter = From ambiguity to abjection: Iraqi-Americans negotiating race in the United States | year = 2006 | page = 127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"'Muslim' identity has certainly congealed as a marker of exclusion and marginalization, in relation to white or mainstream America, which is subjected to similar processes of racialization, and racism, that operate for racial minority groups."{{Cite book | publisher = [[Duke University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-8223-4409-4 | last = Maira | first = Sunaina | title = Missing: youth, citizenship, and empire after 9/11 | date = January 2009 | page = 229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arab Americans in particular were most demonized after the September 11 attacks, which led to hatred towards Middle Easterners living in the United States and elsewhere in the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Abdul Malik Mujahid |url=http://www.soundvision.com/info/peace/demonization.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040603093115/http://soundvision.com/info/peace/demonization.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=2004-06-03 |title=Demonization of Muslims Caused the Iraq Abuse |publisher=Soundvision.com |access-date=2013-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been attacks against Arabs not only on the basis of their religion ([[Islam]]), but also on the basis of their ethnicity; numerous [[Christian Arabs]] have been attacked based on their appearances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/niot/citizens_respond/losaltos.html Attacks on Arab Americans] ([[PBS]])&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, other Middle Eastern peoples ([[Persian people|Persians]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Azerbaijanis]], [[Armenians]], [[Jews]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Yazidis]], [[Kurds]], etc.) who are mistaken for Arabs because of perceived similarities in appearance have been collateral victims of anti-Arabism.

Non-Arab and non-Muslim Middle Eastern people, as well as [[South Asians]] of different ethnic/religious backgrounds ([[Hindu]]s, Muslims and [[Sikh]]s) have been stereotyped as "Arabs" and racialized in a similar manner. The case of [[Balbir Singh Sodhi]], a Sikh who was murdered at a Phoenix gas station by a [[white supremacist]] for "looking like an Arab terrorist" (because of the turban, a requirement of [[Sikhism]]), as well as that of Hindus being attacked for "being Muslims" have achieved prominence and criticism following the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Murphy, Jarrett |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/11/25/national/main530749.shtml |title=Hindu Beaten Because He's Muslim, Mistaken Anti-Islam Thugs Pummel, Hogtie And Stab Deliveryman |publisher=[[CBS News]]|agency=Associated Press |date=February 11, 2009 |access-date=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.adl.org/presrele/hatcr_51/4277_51.asp|title = ADL Condemns Hate Crime Against Hindu|publisher = [[Anti-Defamation League]]|access-date = 2008-07-18|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080718203616/http://www.adl.org/presrele/hatcr_51/4277_51.asp|archive-date = July 18, 2008|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those of Middle Eastern descent who are in the [[United States military]] face racism from fellow soldiers. Army Spc Zachari Klawonn endured numerous instances of racism during his enlistment at [[Fort Hood, Texas]]. During his basic training, he was made to put cloth around his head and play the role of terrorist. His fellow soldiers had to take him down to the ground and draw guns on him. He was also called things such as "[[raghead]]", "sand monkey", and "Zachari bin Laden".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://abcnews.go.com/WN/army-discrimination-muslim-army-specialist-zachari-klawonn-shares/story?id=10372314 | title=Muslim-American Soldier Claims Harassment in the Army | publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company]] | work=[[ABC World News]] with [[Diane Sawyer]] | date=April 14, 2010 | access-date=March 15, 2013 |first1=Bradley |last1=Blackburn |first2=Margaret |last2=Aro |name-list-style=amp }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a 2004 study, although official parameters encompass Arabs as part of the "white American" racial category, some Arab American adolescents do not identify as white.&lt;ref name="caliber"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Gender, Race, and Symbolic Boundaries: Contested Spaces of Identity Among Arab American Adolescents|last=Ajrouch|first=Kristine J.|journal=Sociological Perspectives|volume=47|issue=4|pages=371–391|date=Winter 2004|jstor=10.1525/sop.2004.47.4.371|doi=10.1525/sop.2004.47.4.371|s2cid=143001730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Racial profiling]] is a growing problem for Arab Americans following the [[September 11 attacks]]. Particularly in airports, Arab Americans are often subject to heightened security screening, pre-boarding searches and interrogations, and are sometimes denied passage "based solely on the belief that ethnicity or national origin increases passengers' flight risk."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chandrasekhar|first=Charu A.|title=Flying while Brown: Federal Civil Rights Remedies to Post-9/11 Airline Racial Profiling of South Asians|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/aslj10&amp;i=224|journal=Asian Law Journal|volume= 10| issue = 2|pages=215–252|via=HeinOnilne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, passenger profiling was introduced in the 1960s to identify potential hijackers that fit the "profile" of a person who is "likely to be a terrorist." However, this practice was discontinued in 1972 due to inefficiencies and was replaced by checkpoints and x-ray security. The Department Of Justice released a statement in 1997 claiming that automated passenger screenings would not have a "disparate impact on any group of passengers." The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) believes that "profiling, even under the best circumstances, provides an opportunity for the prejudices and stereotypes held by law enforcement and other officials to be expressed through discriminatory application of profiles. At worst, they are simply a recipe for bigoted behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/jalc67&amp;id=1391&amp;men_tab=srchresults|title=Racial Profiling and Air Travel Security|website=heinonline.org|access-date=2018-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antisemitism]] has also played a role in the [[history of the United States]]. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, hundreds of thousands of ethnic [[Jews]] escaped the [[pogrom]]s in Europe. They boarded boats which left ports that were located on the [[Baltic Sea]] as well as ports that were located in [[Northern Germany]], and they largely arrived at [[Ellis Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name="Takaki-JewishMigr"&gt;Ronald Takaki, ''A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America'' (New York: Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1993), 277–283.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is suggested by [[Leo Rosten]], in his book ''[[The Joys of Yiddish]]'', that as soon as they left their boats, they were subjected to racism by the port immigration authorities. The derogatory term ''[[kike]]'' was adopted in reference to Jews (because most of them could not write and as a result, they may have signed their immigration papers with circles – or kikels in [[Yiddish]]).&lt;ref&gt;Rosten, Leo (1968) ''The Joys of Yiddish''&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts were also made by the [[Asiatic Exclusion League]] to bar Jewish immigrants (along with other [[Ethnic groups in the Middle East|Middle Eastern ethnic groups]], like [[Arabs]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], and [[Armenians]]) from naturalization, nevertheless, they (along with Assyrians and Armenians) were granted US citizenship, despite being classified as [[Asian people|Asians]].&lt;ref&gt;[[iarchive:asiaticexclusion00asia|"Proceedings of the Asiatic Exclusion League"]] Asiatic Exclusion League. San Francisco: April 1910. Pg. 7. "To amend section twenty-one hundred and sixty-nine of the Revised Statutes of the United States. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that section twenty-one hundred and sixty-nine of the Revised Statutes of the United States be, and the same is hereby, amended by adding thereto the following: And Mongolians, Malays, and other Asiatics, except Armenians, Assyrians, and Jews, shall not be naturalized in the United States."&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1910s, [[History of the Jews in the Southern United States|Southern Jewish communities]] were attacked by the Ku Klux Klan, which objected to Jewish immigration, and often used "The Jewish Banker" caricature in its propaganda. In 1915, [[Leo Frank]] was lynched in Georgia after being convicted of [[rape]] and sentenced to death by hanging (his punishment was commuted to life imprisonment).&lt;ref name="lynching openly organized"&gt;Phagan, 1987, p. 27, states that "everyone knew the identity of the lynchers" (putting the words in her father's mouth). Oney, 2003, p. 526, quotes Carl Abernathy as saying, "They'd go to a man's office and talk to him or&amp;nbsp;... see a man on the job and talk to him," and an unidentified lyncher as saying "The organization of the body was more open than mysterious."&lt;/ref&gt; This event was a catalyst in the re-formation of the new Ku Klux Klan.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,898581,00.html|title=The Various Shady Lives of the Ku Klux Klan|date=April 9, 1965|work=[[Time magazine]]|quote=An itinerant Methodist preacher named William Joseph Simmons started up the Klan again in Atlanta.

Events in [[Nazi Germany]] also attracted attention in the United States. Jewish lobbying for intervention in Europe drew opposition from the [[isolationists]], amongst whom was Father [[Charles Coughlin]], a well known radio priest, who was known to be critical of Jews, believing that they were leading the United States into [[World War II|the war]].&lt;ref name="Coughlin"&gt;[http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/53/coughlin.html Father Charles Edward Coughlin (1891–1971)] By Richard Sanders, editor, ''Press for Conversion!''&lt;/ref&gt; He preached weekly, overtly anti-Semitic sermons and, from 1936, he began the publication of a newspaper, ''[[Social Justice (periodical)|Social Justice]]'', in which he printed [[Antisemitic canard|anti-Semitic accusations]] such as those which are contained in ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Christine Athans, "A New Perspective on Father Charles E.

==== New Antisemitism ====
{{Main|New antisemitism}}
In recent years, some scholars have advanced the concept of ''New antisemitism'', coming simultaneously from the [[Far-left politics|far left]], the [[Far-right politics|far right]], and [[Islamism|radical Islam]]. This concept tends to focus on opposition to the creation of a [[Homeland for the Jewish people|Jewish homeland]] in the [[State of Israel]], and it also argues that the language of [[Anti-Zionism]] and [[criticism of Israel]] are both used to attack Jews more broadly. According to this view, the proponents of the new concept believe that criticisms of Israel and [[Zionism]] are often disproportionate in degree and unique in kind, and they attribute these criticisms to antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;Sources for the following are:

[[Yehuda Bauer]], Professor of Holocaust Studies at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], has argued that the concept of a "new antisemitism" is essentially false since it is in fact an alternative form of the old antisemitism of previous decades, which he believes remains latent at times but recurs whenever it is triggered. In his view, the current trigger is the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israel-Palestine situation]]; if a compromise making ground in the [[Arab-Israeli peace process]] were achieved, he believes that antisemitism would once again decline but not disappear.

Noted critics of Israel, such as [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Norman Finkelstein]], question the extent of new antisemitism in the United States. Chomsky has written in his work ''[[Necessary Illusions]]'' that the [[Anti-Defamation League]] casts any question of pro-Israeli policy as antisemitism, conflating and muddling issues as even Zionists receive the allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://home.nvg.org/~skars/ni/ni-c10-s20.html|title=Necessary Illusions: Appendix V [20/33]|website=home.nvg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finkelstein has stated that supposed "new antisemitism" is a preposterous concept advanced by the ADL to combat critics of Israeli policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06/08/30/1418200|title=Congressmember Weiner Gets It Wrong on Palestinian Group He Tried To Bar From U.S.|date=August 30, 2006|publisher=[[Democracy Now!]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114051541/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06%2F08%2F30%2F1418200|archive-date=November 14, 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 27, 2018, Robert D.

This attack resulted in 11 dead and 6 wounded, leaving the assailant charged with 29 criminal counts, one of which was the obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs. Both President [[Donald Trump|Trump]] and Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] of Israel have commented on the event, condemning the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/27/us/active-shooter-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting.html|title=11 Killed in Synagogue Massacre; Suspect Charged With 29 Counts|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The November 1979 [[Iranian hostage crisis]] of the U.S. embassy in [[Tehran]] precipitated a wave of anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States, directed both against the [[Iranian Revolution|new Islamic regime]] and Iranian nationals and immigrants. Even though such sentiments gradually declined after the release of the hostages at the start of 1981, they sometimes flare up. In response, some Iranian immigrants to the U.S. have distanced themselves from their nationality and instead identify primarily on the basis of their ethnic or religious affiliations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mehdi|last=Bozorgmehr|title=No solidarity: Iranians in the U.S|url=http://www.iranian.com/Opinion/2001/May/Iranians/index.html#3a|work=The Iranian|date=May 2, 2001|access-date=2007-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Anti-Indian sentiment#United States}}
In the United States, [[Indian Americans]] have sometimes been mistaken for [[Arabs]] or [[Muslim]]s, and thus, many of the same prejudices which have been experienced by Arab Americans have also been experienced by Indian Americans, regardless of their actual religious or ethnic background.

In the 1980s, a gang known as the [[Dotbusters]] specifically targeted Indian Americans in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] with violence and harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michel Marriott, Special to The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/12/nyregion/in-jersey-city-indians-protest-violence.html?pagewanted=all |title=In Jersey City, Indians Protest Violence |location=Jersey City (Nj) |work=Nytimes.com |date=1987-10-12 |access-date=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of [[racial discrimination]], as well as [[stereotyping]] and [[scapegoating]] of Indian Americans have been conducted in recent years.&lt;ref name="Dhillon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kavitachhibber.com/main/main.jsp?id=legal-Jan2006|title=Kavita Chhibber|website=Kavitachhibber.com|access-date=January 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102072827/http://www.kavitachhibber.com/main/main.jsp?id=legal-Jan2006|archive-date=January 2, 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, racial discrimination against Indian Americans in the workplace has been correlated with [[Indophobia]] due to the rise in [[outsourcing]]/[[offshoring]], whereby Indian Americans are blamed for US companies offshoring [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] labor to [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/~ap2231/ET/et80_July27-05.htm Indophobia: Facts versus Fiction], Arvind Panagariya, [[Columbia University]] archives of ''[[The Economic Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yee"&gt;[http://modelminority.com/article705.html Worries about technical-job losses, discrimination] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704175405/http://www.modelminority.com/article705.html |date=July 4, 2008 }}, by [[Amy Yee]], The Financial Times Ltd., 2004&lt;/ref&gt; According to the offices of the Congressional Caucus on India, many Indian Americans are severely concerned of a backlash, though nothing serious has taken place yet.&lt;ref name="Yee"/&gt; Due to various socio-cultural reasons, implicit racial discrimination against Indian Americans largely go unreported by the Indian American community.&lt;ref name="Dhillon"/&gt;

Numerous cases of religious stereotyping of [[Hinduism in the United States|American Hindus]] (mainly of Indian origin) have also been documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/reference/cshm/ohrc066.html |title=Center for the study of history and memory |publisher=Dlib.indiana.edu |access-date=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], there have been scattered incidents of Indian Americans becoming mistaken targets for [[hate crimes]]. In one example, a [[Sikh]], [[Balbir Singh Sodhi]], was murdered at a [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] gas station in a [[hate crime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Remembering Victims of Hate Crimes | publisher = Southern Poverty Law Center | access-date = 2013-07-05 | url = http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2002/spring/the-forgotten?page=0,6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This happened after [[September 11 attacks|September 11]], and the murderer claimed that his [[turban]] made him think that the victim was a [[Middle-Eastern Americans|Middle Eastern American]].

Using [[Psychometrics of racism|The Schedule of Racist Events]] (SRE), an 18-item self-report inventory that assesses the frequency of racist discrimination, Hope Landrine and Elizabeth A. Klonoff found that racist discrimination is rampant in the lives of African Americans and as a result, it is strongly related to psychiatric symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;''The Schedule of Racist Events: A Measure of Racial Discrimination and a Study of Its Negative Physical and Mental Health Consequences'' Journal of Black Psychology, Vol. 22, No. 2, 144–168 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; A study on racist events in the lives of African American women found that lifetime experiences of racism were positively related to lifetime history of both physical disease and frequency of recent common colds. These relationships were largely unaccounted for by other variables. Demographic variables such as income and education were not related to experiences of racism. The results suggest that racism can be detrimental to African Americans' well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kwate NO, Valdimarsdottir HB, Guevarra JS, Bovbjerg DH |title=Experiences of racist events are associated with negative health consequences for African American women |journal=J Natl Med Assoc |volume=95 |issue=6 |pages=450–60 |date=June 2003 |pmid=12856911 |pmc=2594553}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physiological stress caused by racism has been documented in studies by [[Claude Steele]], Joshua Aronson, and Steven Spencer on what they term "[[stereotype threat]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blascovich J, Spencer SJ, Quinn D, Steele C |title=African Americans and high blood pressure: the role of stereotype threat |journal=Psychol Sci |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=225–9 |date=May 2001 |pmid=11437305 |doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00340 |s2cid=2590855 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Quite similarly, another example of the psychosocial consequences of discrimination have been observed in a study sampling Mexican-origin participants in Fresno, California. It was found that perceived discrimination is correlated with depressive symptoms, especially for those less acculturated in the United States, like Mexican immigrants and migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finch|first=Brian|title=Perceived Discrimination and Depression among Mexican-Origin Adults in California|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|year=2000|volume=41|issue=3|pages=295–313|doi=10.2307/2676322|pmid=11011506|jstor=2676322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the vein of somatic responses to discrimination, Kennedy et al. found that both measures of collective disrespect were strongly correlated with black mortality (r = 0.53 to 0.56), as well as with white mortality (r = 0.48 to 0.54). These data suggest that racism, measured as an ecologic characteristic, is associated with higher mortality in both blacks and whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kennedy BP, Kawachi I, Lochner K, Jones C, Prothrow-Stith D |title=(Dis)respect and black mortality |journal=Ethn Dis |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=207–14 |year=1997 |pmid=9467703 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers also suggest that racial segregation may lead to disparities in health and mortality. Thomas LaVeist (1989; 1993) tested the hypothesis that [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] would aid in explaining race differences in infant mortality rates across cities. Analyzing 176 large and midsized cities, LaVeist found support for the hypothesis. Since LaVeist's studies, segregation has received increased attention as a determinant of racial disparities in mortality.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Studies have shown that mortality rates for male and female African Americans are lower in areas with lower levels of residential segregation. Mortality for male and female whites was not associated in either direction with residential segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hart KD, Kunitz SJ, Sell RR, Mukamel DB |title=Metropolitan governance, residential segregation, and mortality among African Americans |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=434–8 |date=March 1998 |pmid=9518976 |pmc=1508338 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.88.3.434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers Sharon A. Jackson, Roger T. Anderson, Norman J. Johnson and Paul D. Sorlie found that, after adjustment for family income, [[Mortality rate|mortality]] risk increased with increasing minority residential segregation among Blacks aged 25 to 44 years and non-Blacks aged 45 to 64 years. In most age/race/gender groups, the highest and lowest mortality risks occurred in the highest and lowest categories of residential segregation, respectively. These results suggest that minority residential segregation may influence mortality risk and underscore the traditional emphasis on the social underpinnings of disease and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jackson SA, Anderson RT, Johnson NJ, Sorlie PD |title=The relation of residential segregation to all-cause mortality: a study in black and white |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=615–7 |date=April 2000 |pmid=10754978 |pmc=1446199 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.90.4.615}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of heart disease among African Americans are associated with the segregation patterns in the neighborhoods where they live (Fang ''et al.'' 1998).

This study chose larger sample sized and [[Peer review|peer reviewed]] studies, over smaller sampled and non-peer reviewed studies.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In this review, researchers showed links between racial discrimination and lower socioemotional, academic, and behavioral outcomes. The socioemotional variable included depression, internalized symptoms, self-esteem, and positive well-being; academics included achievement, engagement, and motivation; and behavioral outcomes included externalized behaviors, substance abuse, deviant peer associations, and risky sexual behaviors.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Researchers examined the links between discrimination and other demographic variables such as race, age, and country of residence. When looking at the impact of race/ethnicity, results show that Asian and Latino youth show greater socioemotional distress and Latino youth show lower academic outcomes. Younger teens (10 to 13 years) experience more socioemotional distress than those in middle or late teens. Furthermore, when looking at county of residence, teens in the United States have a much stronger link to socioemotional distress than other countries included in the review.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

As early as 1866, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866|Civil Rights Act]] provided a remedy for intentional race discrimination in employment by private employers and state and local public employers. The [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]] applies to public employment or employment involving state action prohibiting deprivation of rights secured by the federal constitution or federal laws through action under color of law. Title VII is the principal federal statute with regard to employment discrimination prohibiting unlawful employment discrimination by public and private employers, labor organizations, training programs and employment agencies based on race or color, religion, gender, and national origin. Title VII also prohibits retaliation against any person for opposing any practice forbidden by statute, or for making a charge, testifying, assisting, or participating in a proceeding under the statute. The [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]] expanded the damages available in Title VII cases and granted Title VII plaintiffs the right to a jury trial. Title VII also provides that race and color discrimination against every race and color is prohibited.

Popular culture (songs, theater) for European American audiences in the 19th century created and perpetuated negative stereotypes of African Americans. One key symbol of racism against African Americans was the use of [[blackface]]. Directly related to this was the institution of [[Blackface|minstrelsy]]. Other stereotypes of African Americans included the fat, dark-skinned "[[mammy archetype|mammy]]" and the irrational, hypersexual male "buck".

In recent years increasing numbers of African-American activists have asserted that [[rap music]] videos commonly utilize scantily clothed African-American performers posing as thugs or pimps. The [[NAACP]] and the [[National Congress of Black Women]] also have called for the reform of images on videos and on television. [[Julian Bond]] said that in a segregated society, people get their impressions of other groups from what they see in videos and what they hear in music.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;Felicia R. Lee, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/05/arts/05enou.html Protesting Demeaning Images in Media]" ''[[New York Times]]'' November 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marissa Newhall, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/15/AR2007091501441.html Channeling Their Discontent, 500 Gather at Executive's D.C.

[[File:1899BalanceCartoon.jpg|thumb|left|In 1899 Uncle Sam balances his new possessions which are depicted as "savage" children. The figures are [[Puerto Rico]], Hawaii, [[Cuba]], [[Philippines]] and "Ladrone Is." (the [[Mariana Islands]]).]]
In a similar vein, activists protested against the BET show, ''Hot Ghetto Mess,'' which satirizes the culture of working-class African-Americans. The protests resulted in the change of the television show name to ''[[We Got to Do Better]].''&lt;ref name="nytimes1" /&gt;

It is understood that representations of minorities in the media have the ability to reinforce or change stereotypes. For example, in one study, a collection of white subjects were primed by a comedy skit either showing a stereotypical or neutral portrayal of African-American characters. Participants were then required to read a vignette describing an incident of sexual violence, with the alleged offender either white or black, and assign a rating for perceived guilt. For those shown the stereotypical African-American character, there was a significantly higher guilt rating for black alleged offender in the subsequent vignette, in comparison to the other conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ford|first=Thomas|title=Effects of Stereotypical Television Portrayals of African-Americans on Person Perception|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|year=1997|volume=60|issue=3|pages=266–275|doi=10.2307/2787086|jstor=2787086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While schemas have an overt societal consequence, the strong development of them have lasting effect on recipients. Overall, it is found that strong in-group attitudes are correlated with academic and economic success. In a study analyzing the interaction of assimilation and racial-ethnic schemas for Hispanic youth found that strong schematic identities for Hispanic youth undermined academic achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Altschul|first1=Inna |first2=Daphna |last2=Oyserman |first3=Deborah|last3=Bybee|title=Racial-Ethnic Self-Schemas and Segmented Assimilation: Identity and the Academic Achievement of Hispanic Youth|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|date=September 2008|volume=71|issue=3|pages=302–320 |doi=10.1177/019027250807100309|jstor=20141842|s2cid=18018980 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional stereotypes attributed to minorities continue to influence societal interactions. For example, a 1993 Harvard Law Review article states that Asian-Americans are commonly viewed as submissive, as a combination of relative physical stature and Western comparisons of cultural attitudes. Furthermore, Asian-Americans are depicted as the model minority, unfair competitors, foreigners, and indistinguishable. These stereotypes can serve to dehumanize Asian-Americans and catalyze hostility and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Racial Violence against Asian Americans|journal=Harvard Law Review|year=1993|volume=106|issue=8|pages=1926–1943|jstor=1341790|doi=10.2307/1341790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Formal discrimination ====
Formal discrimination against minorities has been present throughout American history. Leland T. Saito, Associate Professor of Sociology and American Studies &amp; Ethnicity at the [[University of Southern California]], writes, "Political rights have been circumscribed by race, class and gender since the founding of the United States, when the right to vote was restricted to white men of property. Throughout the history of the United States race has been used by whites – a category that has also shifted through time – for legitimizing and creating difference and social, economic and political exclusion."&lt;ref&gt;Leland T. Saito (1998). "Race and Politics: Asian Americans, Latinos, and Whites in a Los Angeles Suburb". p. 154. University of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Within education, a survey of black students in sixteen majority white universities found that four of five African-Americans reported some form of racial discrimination. For example, in February 1988, the University of Michigan enforced a new anti discrimination code following the distribution of fliers saying blacks "don't belong in classrooms, they belong hanging from trees". Other forms of reported discrimination were refusal to sit next to black in lecture, ignored input in class settings, and informal segregation. While the penalties are imposed, the psychological consequences of formal discrimination can still manifest. Black students, for example, reported feelings of heightened isolation and suspicion. Furthermore, studies have shown that academic performance is stunted for black students with these feelings as a result of their campus race interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilkerson|first=Isabel|title=Campus Blacks Feel Racism's Nuances|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/17/us/campus-blacks-feel-racism-s-nuances.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|access-date=November 5, 2013|work=The New York Times|date=April 17, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Minority-minority racism ====
{{Main|Interminority racism in the United States}}
Minority racism is sometimes considered controversial because of theories of [[power (sociology)|power]] in society. Some theories of racism insist that racism can only exist in the context of social power so it can be imposed upon others.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Catherine A. Hansman, Leon Spencer, Dale Grant, Mary Jackson, "Beyond Diversity: Dismantling Barriers in Education," ''Journal of Instructional Psychology'', March 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Yet discrimination and racism has also been noted between racially [[marginalized]] groups. For example, there has been ongoing violence between African American and [[Mexican American]] gangs, particularly in [[Southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Blankstein And Joel Rubin.

This amounts to a standing authorization for Latino gang members to prove their mettle by terrorizing or even murdering any blacks sighted in a neighborhood claimed by a gang loyal to the Mexican Mafia.{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackamericaweb.com/site.aspx/bawnews/stateof/hutchinson105] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011215616/http://www.blackamericaweb.com/site.aspx/bawnews/stateof/hutchinson105|date=October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several significant riots in [[California prisons]] where Mexican American inmates and African Americans have targeted each other particularly, based on racial reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.pitt.edu/about/engaged/jurist|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307234325/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/12/race-riot-put-down-at-california-state.php|url-status=dead|title=JURIST &amp;#124; School of Law &amp;#124; University of Pittsburgh|archive-date=March 7, 2010|website=www.law.pitt.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsmine.org/archive/security/incarceration/racial-segregation-continues-in-california-prisons.txt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823060942/http://newsmine.org/archive/security/incarceration/racial-segregation-continues-in-california-prisons.txt|url-status=dead|title=Racial segregation continues in California prisons|archive-date=August 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflict has also been noted between recent immigrant groups and their established ethnic counterparts within the United States. Rapidly-growing communities of [[Africans in the United States|African]] and [[Caribbean]] immigrants have come into conflict with American blacks. The amount of interaction and cooperation between black immigrants and American blacks is, ironically, debatable. One can argue that racial discrimination and cooperation are not ordinarily based on skin color, but are instead based on shared or common, cultural experiences and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06044/654613.stm |title=African immigrants face bias from blacks |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=December 31, 1969 |access-date=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/Story?id=5237459&amp;page=1 |title=Racism not always black and white |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=June 25, 2008 |access-date=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Interpersonal discrimination ====
In a manner that defines interpersonal discrimination in the United States, Darryl Brown of the Virginia Law Review states that while "our society has established a consensus against blatant, intentional racism in the decades since Brown v Board of Education and it has also developed a sizeable set of legal remedies to address it", our legal system "ignores the possibility that 'race' is structural or interstitial, that it can be the root of injury even when it is not traceable to a specific intention or action"&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Darryl|title=Racism and Race Relations in the University|journal=Virginia Law Review|date=March 1990|volume=76|issue=2|pages=295–335|jstor=1073204|doi=10.2307/1073204|hdl=10288/8306|url=https://digitalarchive.wm.edu/xmlui/bitstream/10288/8306/1/BrownDarrylwm.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike formal discrimination, interpersonal discrimination is often not an overt or deliberate act of racism. For example, in an incident regarding a racial remark which was made by a professor at Virginia Law, a rift was created by conflicting definitions of racism. For the students who defended the professor's innocence, "racism was defined as an act of intentional maliciousness". Yet for African Americans, racism was broadened to a detrimental influence on "the substantive dynamics of the classroom". As an effect, it is argued that the "daily repetition of subtle racism and subordination in the classroom can ultimately be, for African Americans, even more reductive of stress, anxiety and alienation than blatant racist acts can be." Moreover, the attention which is given to these acts of discrimination diverts energy from academics, becoming a distraction that white students do not generally face.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt;

==== Ethnic-racial socialization ====
Ethnic-racial socialization refers to the transfer of knowledge about various aspects of race and/ or ethnicity through generations.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Ming-Te|last2=Henry|first2=Daphne A.|last3=Smith|first3=Leann V.|last4=Huguley|first4=James P.|last5=Guo|first5=Jiesi|date=January 2020|title=Parental ethnic-racial socialization practices and children of color's psychosocial and behavioral adjustment: A systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=American Psychologist|volume=75|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.1037/amp0000464|pmid=31058521|issn=1935-990X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents of color use ethnic-racial socialization to transfer cultural knowledge to their children in order to protect them from potential biases which they may face as a result of their ethnicity and/or race.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; However, how parents choose to socialize their children regarding issues of ethnicity and race may affect children differently.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; For example, when parent's socialization efforts focus on positive aspects of their race/ethnicity, children of color tend to report higher self-esteem.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; On the other hand, if the focus of socialization mainly revolves around mistrust about interracial or inter-ethnic relations, children’s self-concept, or how children view themselves might suffer.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Promotion of socialization that centers on mistrust is especially harmful when parents present it without also teaching positive coping skills.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Wang et al. (2020)&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; conducted a meta-analytic review of 334 articles examining the effects of ethnic-racial socialization on children of color’s psychosocial adjustment. Researchers evaluated the stage of children’s development in which the effects of ethnic-racial socialization would be most prominent. Their findings using their systematic review process showed a positive relationship between parental ethnic-racial socialization and psychosocial well-being measures, including self-perception, confidence, and interpersonal relationships.

The effects of age varied based on the psychosocial well-being measure a study used. Results showed that the link between positive self-perception and ethnic-racial socialization was most effective when it occurred in childhood and early adolescence.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; On the other hand, children who reported positive relationships between their interpersonal relationships and ethnic-racial socialization showed this paper in middle to late adolescence.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; The effects of ethnic-racial socialization also varied based on children's race/ethnicity. Self-perception and ethnic-racial socialization are related more positively among African Americans,&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; suggesting that parents used ethnic-racial socialization to buffer against the deep-rooted stigma and biases African Americans face in the United States.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Contrary to the experiences of African Americans, ethnic-racial socialization was related to low self-perception among Asian Americans.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;  Extensive research is required to better understand the connection of ethnic-racial socialization for Asian American children’s psychosocial well-being.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

In order to better understand the effects of ethnic-racial socialization and psychological development, research should take into account known moderating factors similar to [[stereotype threat]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; It is important to note that the research findings were correlational and as such does not imply causality.

=== Institutional racism ===
[[Institutional racism]] is the theory that aspects of the structure, pervasive attitudes, and the established institutions in society disadvantage some racial groups, although not with an overtly discriminatory mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eraseracismny.org/html/whatis/whatis.php What is Institutional and Structural Racism?] ERASE RACISM&lt;/ref&gt; There are several factors that play into institutional racism, including but not limited to: accumulated wealth/benefits from racial groups that have benefited from past discrimination, educational and occupational disadvantages faced by non-native English speakers in the United States, ingrained stereotypical images that still remain in the society (e.g. black men are likely to be criminals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bullock | first1 = III | last2 = Rodgers | first2 = Jr. | year = 1976 | title = Institutional Racism: Prerequisites, Freezing, and Mapping | journal = Phylon | volume = 37 | issue = 3| pages = 212–223 | doi=10.2307/274450| jstor = 274450 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article, Peter Kaufman describes three instances in which institutional racism has contributed to current views of race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Everyday Sociology Blog: Michael Brown, Ferguson, Missouri, and the Invisibility of Race|url = http://www.everydaysociologyblog.com/2014/08/michael-brown-ferguson-missouri-and-the-invisibility-of-race.html|website = www.everydaysociologyblog.com|access-date = 2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are:
# The mis- and Missing Education of Race, in which he describes problems the educational system has in discussing "slavery, race, racism, and topics such as white privilege". He goes on to say that schools are still segregated based on class and race, which also contributes to race relations&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Residential Racial Segregation. According to Kaufman, the reason that schools are still segregated is due to towns and cities being largely segregated still.
# Media Monsters. This describes the role in which the media has in the portrayal of race. Mass media tends to play on "depictions of racialized stereotypes in the mass media [which are] ubiquitous, and such caricaturized images shape our perceptions of various racial groups". An example of this is the stereotyping of Blacks as criminals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book |first=Wilson |last=Head |title=A Life on the Edge: Experiences in Black and White in North America |publisher=University of Toronto Press |date=1995 |isbn=978-0-9680066-0-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Immigration ====
{{See also|Illegal immigration to the United States|Immigration to the United States|History of immigration to the United States}}

Access to United States [[citizenship]] was restricted by race, beginning with the [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] which excluded "non-whites" from citizenship.&lt;ref name="Schultz"/&gt;
Institutionalized prejudice existed against white practitioners of [[Roman Catholicism]] who immigrated from countries such as [[Ireland]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhc.rtp.nc.us/tserve/nineteen/nkeyinfo/nromcath.htm Roman Catholics and Immigration in Nineteenth-Century America] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625123747/http://www.nhc.rtp.nc.us/tserve/nineteen/nkeyinfo/nromcath.htm |date=June 25, 2007 }} by Julie Byrne, Dept. of Religion, Duke University, National Humanities Center&lt;/ref&gt; Other efforts include the 1882 [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] and the 1924 [[National Origins Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=47 |title=Chinese Exclusion Act (1882) |publisher=Ourdocuments.gov |date=July 1, 1968 |access-date=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicaldocuments.com/ImmigrationActof1924.htm Immigration Act of 1924] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210025205/http://www.historicaldocuments.com/ImmigrationActof1924.htm |date=February 10, 2008 }} HistoricalDocuments.com&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Immigration Act of 1924]] was aimed at further restricting the immigration of Southern and Eastern Europeans who had begun to enter the country in large numbers beginning in the 1890s. By limiting the immigration of non-Northern Europeans, according to the U.S. Department of State Office of the Historian, the purpose of the 1924 act was "to preserve the ideal of American homogeneity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1921-1936/immigration-act | work=U.S. Department of State Office of the Historian | title=The Immigration Act of 1924 (The Johnson-Reed Act) | access-date=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]], the racist preference for white immigrants which dated back to the 18th century was ended,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Immigration Act of 1965 and the Creation of a Modern, Diverse America |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-immigration-act-of-19_b_8394570 |access-date=August 4, 2019 |work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in response to this change, [[white nationalism]] grew in the United States as the conservative movement developed in mainstream society.&lt;ref&gt;"Black Politics are in a Black Hole", ''Newsday'' (New York, January 14, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist [[Samuel P.

In conjunction with immigration reform in the late 1980s (the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]]), IRCA-related instances of discriminatory behavior towards Hispanics with regard to employment have been documented within the United States. Because the measure made it unlawful to hire immigrants to work in the United States without authorization, avoidant treatment of "foreign-appearing workers" increased when employers avoided the risk of sanctions by bypassing the required record-keeping process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lowell|first=Lindsay|title=Unintended Consequences of Immigration Reform: Discrimination and HIspanic Employment|journal=Demography|date=November 1995|volume=32|issue=4|pages=617–628|doi=10.2307/2061678|jstor=2061678|pmid=8925950|s2cid=5720931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nazi Germany's use of the American racist model====
{{see|Nazi eugenics|Nazism and race|Racial policy of Nazi Germany}}
[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and other [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] praised America's system of [[institutional racism]] and believed that it was the model which should be followed in their [[Reich]]. In particular, they believed that it was the model for the expansion of German territory into the territories of other nations and the elimination of their indigenous inhabitants, as well as the model for the implementation of racist immigration laws which banned some races, and laws which denied full citizenship to blacks, which they also wanted to implement against Jews. Hitler's book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' extolled America as the only contemporary example of a country with racist ("völkisch") citizenship statutes in the 1920s, and Nazi lawyers made use of American models when they crafted their own laws in [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="Whitman"/&gt; U.S. citizenship laws and [[Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States|anti-miscegenation laws]] directly inspired the two principal [[Nuremberg Laws]]—the Citizenship Law and the Blood Law.&lt;ref name="Whitman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitman|first1=James Q.|title=Hitler's American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law|date=2017|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=37–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Establishing a restrictive entry system for Germany, Hitler admiringly wrote: "The American Union categorically refuses the immigration of physically unhealthy elements, and simply excludes the immigration of certain races."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/american-laws-against-coloreds-influenced-nazi-racial-planners/ "American laws against 'coloreds' influenced Nazi racial planners"].

Analysis of more than 20 million traffic stops in North Carolina showed that blacks were more than twice as likely as whites to be pulled over by police for traffic stops, and that blacks were more likely to be searched following the stop. There were no significant difference in the likelihood that Hispanics would be pulled over, but Hispanics were much more likely to be searched following a traffic stop than whites.

A 2016 study in the journal ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]]'' found that blacks and Hispanics were systemically underrepresented in education-programs for gifted children where teachers and parents referred students to those programs; when a universal screening program based on IQ was used to refer students, the disparity was reduced significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Card|first1=David|last2=Giuliano|first2=Laura|date=2016-11-29|title=Universal screening increases the representation of low-income and minority students in gifted education|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=113|issue=48|pages=13678–13683|doi=10.1073/pnas.1605043113|issn=0027-8424|pmc=5137751|pmid=27856741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "brown paper bag test," also known as a [[paper bag party]], along with the "ruler test" refers to a ritual once practiced by certain African-American sororities and fraternities who would not let anyone into the group whose skin tone was darker than a paper bag.&lt;ref name="Kerr"&gt;Kerr, A.

The curriculum in U.S. schools has also contained racism against non-white Americans, including [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], [[African Americans|black Americans]], [[Mexican Americans]], and [[Asian Americans]].&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Particularly during the 19th and early 20th centuries, school textbooks and other teaching materials emphasized the biological and social inferiority of black Americans, consistently portraying black people as simple, irresponsible, and oftentimes, in situations of suffering that were implied to be their fault (and not the effects of slavery and other oppression).&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;Elson, Ruth Miller (1964).

OCLC 951742385.&lt;/ref&gt; Black Americans were also depicted as expendable and their suffering as commonplace, as evidenced by a poem about "Ten Little Nigger Boys" dying off one by one that was circulated as a children's counting exercise from 1875 to the mid-1900s.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Historian [[Carter G. Woodson]] analyzed American curriculum as completely lacking any mention of black Americans' merits in the early [[20th century|20th century.]] Based on his observations of the time, he wrote that American students, including black students, who went through U.S. schooling would come out believing that black people had no significant history and had contributed nothing to human civilization, which is not true.&lt;ref&gt;Woodson, Carter G. (Carter Godwin) (1993). ''The mis-education of the Negro''. Internet Archive. Trenton, N.J. : AfricaWorld Press. {{ISBN|978-0-86543-171-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major example of racism in education is the targeted schooling of Native Americans in [[American Indian boarding schools|American Indian Boarding Schools]], in which the curriculum was designed to commit [[cultural genocide]] against Native peoples.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Stout, Mary, 1954- (2012). ''Native American boarding schools''. Santa Barbara: Greenwood. {{ISBN|978-0-313-38676-3}}. [[OCLC (identifier)|OCLC]] 745980477.&lt;/ref&gt; In these schools, Native children were prohibited from participating in any of their cultures' traditions, including speaking their own languages. Instead, they were required to speak English at all times and learn geography, science, and history (among other disciplines) as white Americans saw fit.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This meant learning a version of history that upheld whites' superiority and rightful "inheritance" of the lands of the United States, while Natives were relegated to a position of having to assimilate to white culture without ever truly being considered equals.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

School curriculum often implicitly and explicitly upheld white people as the superior race marginalized the contributions and perspectives of non-white peoples as if they were (or are) not as important.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Charles W. (1994). "REVISIONIST ONTOLOGIES: THEORIZING WHITE SUPREMACY". Social and Economic Studies. 43 (3): 105–134. ISSN 0037-7651.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, a significant number of students were taught that [[Adam and Eve]] were white, and the other races evolved from their various descendants, growing further and further away from the original white standard.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; In addition, whites were also fashioned as the capable caretakers of other races, namely black and Native people, who could not take care of themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Elson, Ruth Miller (1964). ''Guardians of Tradition: American Schoolbooks of the Nineteenth Century''. Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was at odds with the violence white Americans had committed against indigenous and black peoples, but it was coupled with soft language that, for example, defended these acts. Mills (1994) cites the narrative about Europeans' "discovery" of a "[[New World]]," despite the people who already inhabited it, and its subsequent "colonization" instead of conquest, as examples. He maintains that these word choices constitute a cooptation of history by white people, who have used it to their advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Charles W. (1994).

A study published in the American Journal of Public Health estimated that: "over 886,000 deaths could have been prevented from 1991 to 2000 if African Americans had received the same quality of care as whites". The key differences which they cited were lack of insurance, inadequate [[health insurance|insurance]], poor service, and reluctance to seek care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Woolf SH, Johnson RE, Fryer GE, Rust G, Satcher D|date=December 2004|title=The health impact of resolving racial disparities: an analysis of US mortality data|journal=Am J Public Health|volume=94|issue=12|pages=2078–81|doi=10.2105/AJPH.94.12.2078|pmc=1448594|pmid=15569956}}&lt;/ref&gt; A history of government-sponsored experimentation, such as the notorious [[Tuskegee Syphilis Study]] has left a legacy of African American distrust of the medical system.&lt;ref&gt;"The History of Black 'Paranoia{{'"}}, ch. 3 of Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair, ''Whiteout: The CIA, Drugs, and the Press'', London: Verso, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, agents' marketing efforts increase with asking price for white, but not for black, customers; blacks are more likely than whites to see houses in suburban, integrated areas ([[Racial steering|steering]]); and the houses agents show are more likely to deviate from the initial request when the customer is black than when the customer is white.

A 2017 paper by Troesken and Walsh found that pre-20th century cities "created and sustained residential segregation through private norms and vigilante activity." However, "when these private arrangements began to break down during the early 1900s" whites started "lobbying municipal governments for segregation ordinances."

A 2017 report by Travis L. Dixon (of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) found that major media outlets tended to portray black families as dysfunctional and dependent while white families were portrayed as stable. These portrayals may give the impression that poverty and welfare are primarily black issues.

African Americans who possess a lighter skin complexion and "European features," such as lighter eyes, and smaller noses and lips have more opportunities in the media industry. For example, film producers hire lighter-skinned African Americans more often, television producers choose lighter-skinned cast members, and magazine editors choose African American models that resemble European features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woodard|first1=K|year=2000|title=Traumatic Shame: Toni Morrison, Televisual Culture, and the Cultural Politics of the Emotions|journal=Cultural Critique|volume=46|issue=1|pages=210–240|doi=10.2307/1354414|jstor=1354414}}&lt;/ref&gt; A content analysis conducted by Scott and Neptune (1997) shows that less than one percent of advertisements in major magazines featured African American models. When African Americans did appear in advertisements they were mainly portrayed as athletes, entertainers or unskilled laborers.

Colorism was and still is very much evident in the media. An example of this is shown in the [[minstrel show]]s that were popular during and after slavery. Minstrel shows were a very popular form of theater that involved white and black people in black face portraying black people while doing demeaning things. The actors painted their faces with black paint to and over lined their lips with bright red lipstick to exaggerate and make fun of black people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Minstrel Show|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/jackson/minstrel/minstrel.html|access-date=2017-11-14|website=chnm.gmu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; When minstrel shows died out and television became popular, black actors were rarely hired and when they were, they had very specific roles. These roles included being servants, slaves, idiots, and criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Punyanunt|first=Narissa|title=The Perceived Realism of African American Portrayals on Television|journal=The Howard Journal of Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt; White people wanted to keep this narrative going that black people were forever in debt to them because they essentially rescued blacks from themselves and made them humans instead of savages. This is seen in the "mammy" role that black women often played. The highlights of this role included black women being the loyal servant to the master and taking care of and loving his kids more than her own. Even though black people were allowed to be on TV, they still couldn't be too black. They had to pass the color tests and if they were dark, they were usually playing a humiliating role. That trend is something that follows into present day especially for women.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} There is a huge absence of dark black women in the media and when they are shown, they are typically portraying the angry black woman stereotype but have a light-skinned character to balance them out. Darker women are rarely the protagonist that isn't troubled by drugs, or caught up in the legal system.

Some research suggests that white voters' voting behavior is motivated by racial threat. A 2016 study, for instance, found that white Chicago voters' turnout decreased when public housing was reconstructed and 25,000 African Americans displaced. This suggest that white voters' turnout decreased due to not living in proximity to African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enos|first=Ryan D.|date=2016-01-01|title=What the Demolition of Public Housing Teaches Us about the Impact of Racial Threat on Political Behavior|journal=American Journal of Political Science|language=en|volume=60|issue=1|pages=123–142|doi=10.1111/ajps.12156|s2cid=51895998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued that the [[Dog-whistle politics|racial coding]] of concepts like [[crime]] and [[welfare]] has been used to strategically influence public political views. Racial coding is implicit; it incorporates racially primed language or imagery in order to allude to racial attitudes and thinking. For example, in the context of domestic policy, it is argued that [[Ronald Reagan]] implied that linkages existed between concepts like "special interests" and "[[big government]]" and ill-perceived minority groups in the 1980s, using the conditioned negativity which existed toward the minority groups in order to discredit certain policies and programs during campaigns. In a study which analyzes how political ads prime attitudes, Valentino compares the voting responses of participants after they are exposed to the narration of a George W. Bush advertisement which is paired with three different types of visuals which contain different embedded racial cues in order to create three conditions: neutral, race comparison, and undeserving blacks. For example, as the narrator states "Democrats want to spend your tax dollars on wasteful government programs", the video shows an image of a black woman and her child in an office setting. Valentino found that the undeserving blacks condition produced the largest primed effect in racialized policies, like opposition to [[affirmative action]] and welfare spending.&lt;ref name="Valentino"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Valentino|first=Nicholas|author-link=Nicholas Valentino|date=March 2002|title=Cues that Matter: How Political Ads Prime Racial Attitudes during Campaigns|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=96|issue=1|pages=75–90|doi=10.1017/s0003055402004240|jstor=3117811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ian Haney López]], Professor of Law at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], refers to this phenomenon as [[dog-whistle politics]], which, he argues, has pushed middle class white Americans to vote against their economic self-interest in order to punish "undeserving minorities" which, they believe, are receiving too much public assistance at their expense. According to López, conservative middle-class whites, convinced that minorities are the enemy by powerful economic interests, supported politicians who promised to curb illegal immigration and crack down on crime, but inadvertently they also voted for policies that favor the extremely rich, such as slashing taxes for top income brackets, giving corporations more regulatory control over industry and financial markets, [[Union busting|busting unions]], cutting pensions for future public employees, reducing funding for public schools, and retrenching the social welfare state. He argues that these same voters cannot link rising inequality which has impacted their lives to the policy agendas which they support, which resulted in a massive transfer of wealth to the top 1% of the population since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://billmoyers.com/episode/ian-haney-lopez-on-the-dog-whistle-politics-of-race/ Full Show: Ian Haney López on the Dog Whistle Politics of Race, Part I].

In the United States, most crimes in which victims are targeted on the basis of their race or ethnicity are considered [[hate crime]]s. (For federal law purposes, crimes in which Hispanic people are targeted because of their identity are considered hate crimes based on ethnicity.) Leading forms of bias which are cited in the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, based on law enforcement agency filings include: anti-black, anti-Jewish, [[Homophobia|anti-homosexual]], and [[Hispanophobia|anti-Hispanic bias]] in that order in both 2004 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2004/openpage.htm Hate Crime Statistics, 2004]. [https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2005/index.html Hate Crime Statistics, 2005].&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, whites, black people, and Hispanic people had similar rates of violent hate crime victimization between 2007 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hate Crime Victimization, 2003–2011 |url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/hcv0311.pdf |publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics |access-date=August 30, 2014 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907020823/http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/hcv0311.pdf |archive-date=September 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/hcrvp.pdf Hate Crime Reported by Victims and Police] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130227040413/http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/hcrvp.pdf |date=February 27, 2013 }}, Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report, November 2005, NCJ 209911.&lt;/ref&gt; However, from 2011 to 2012, violent hate crimes against Hispanic people increased by 300%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/spotlight/hate_crimes/facts.html | title=Highlights from Hate Crime Victimization, 2004–2012 – Statistical Tables | publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics | access-date=June 20, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216124400/https://www.ncjrs.gov/spotlight/Hate_Crimes/facts.html | archive-date=December 16, 2016 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; When considering all hate crimes, not just violent ones, African Americans are far more likely to be victims than other racial groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2010/narratives/hate-crime-2010-incidents-and-offenses | title=FBI – Incidents and Offenses | publisher=Criminal Justice Information Services | access-date=June 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/fbi-blacks-often-targeted-hate-crimes/ | title=FBI: Blacks most often targeted in hate crimes | publisher=PBS | date=June 20, 2015 | access-date=June 20, 2016 | author=Sreenivasan, Hari}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Century Foundation]], a [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] organization founded by [[Jared Taylor]], argues that black people are more likely to commit hate crimes than whites, and it also argues that FBI figures inflate the number of hate crimes committed by whites by counting Hispanic people as "whites".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nc-f.org/colorcrime1999.htm The Color of Crime], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Other analysts are sharply critical of the NCF's findings, referring to the mainstream criminological view that "Racial and ethnic data must be treated with caution. Existing research on crime has generally shown that racial or ethnic identity is not predictive of criminal behavior with data which has been controlled for social and economic factors."&lt;ref&gt;Preface to Minnesota's official crime data reports, quoted in Southern Poverty Law Center, [http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=255 Coloring Crime] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113123038/http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=255 |date=November 13, 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; NCF's methodology and statistics are further sharply criticized as flawed and deceptive by anti-racist activists Tim Wise and the Southern Poverty Law Center.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Wise, "[http://www.lipmagazine.org/~timwise/colorofdeception.html The Color of Deception: Race, Crime and Sloppy Social Science]," 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Southern Poverty Law Center, [http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=255 Coloring Crime] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113123038/http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=255 |date=November 13, 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first post-Jim Crow era hate crime to make sensational media attention was the [[murder of Vincent Chin]], an Asian American of Chinese descent in 1982. He was attacked by two white assailants who were recently laid off from a Detroit area auto factory job and blamed Japanese people for their individual unemployment. Chin was not of Japanese descent, but the assailants testified in the criminal court case that he "looked like a [[Jap]]", an ethnic slur that is used to describe Japanese and other Asian people, and they were angry enough to beat him to death.

Continuing [[antisemitism in the United States|antisemitism]] has remained an issue in the United States and the 2011 ''Survey of American Attitudes Toward Jews in America'', released by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), has found that the recent [[Late-2000s recession|world economic recession]] increased the expression of some antisemitic viewpoints among Americans. Most of the people who were surveyed expressed [[Philo-Semitism|pro-Jewish sentiments]], with 64% of them agreeing that Jewish people have contributed much to U.S. social culture. Yet the polling also found that 19% of Americans answered "probably true" to the [[antisemitic canard]] that "Jews have too much control/influence on [[Wall Street]]" (see [[Economic antisemitism]]) while 15% of Americans concurred with the related statement that Jews seem "more willing to use shady practices" in business than other people do. Reflecting on the lingering antisemitism of about one in five Americans, [[Abraham H. Foxman]], the ADL's national director, has argued, "It is disturbing that with all of the strides we have made in becoming a more tolerant society, anti-Semitic beliefs continue to hold a vice-grip on a small but not insubstantial segment of the American public."&lt;ref name=adl-poll&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/ADL-poll-Anti-Semitic-attitudes-on-rise-in-USA|title=ADL poll: Anti-Semitic attitudes on rise in USA|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=November 3, 2011|access-date=December 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[ABC News]] report which was released in 2007 recounted that past ABC polls which were conducted over a period of several years have tended to find that "six percent have self-reported harboring prejudice against [[Jews]], 27 percent have self-reported harboring prejudice against [[Muslim]]s, 25 percent have self-reported harboring prejudice against [[Arabs]]," and "one in 10 have conceded harboring at least a little bit of prejudice " against [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic Americans]]. The report also stated that a full 34% of Americans reported harboring "some racist feelings" in general as a self-description.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/images/US/1048a1Hispanics.pdf|title=Aquí Se Habla Español – and Two-Thirds Don't Mind|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=October 8, 2007|access-date=December 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Associated Press]] and [[Yahoo News]] survey of 2,227 adult Americans in 2008 found that 10% of white respondents stated that "a lot" of discrimination still exists against African-Americans while 45% of white respondents stated that only "some" discrimination still exists against African Americans compared to 57% of black respondents who stated that "a lot" of discrimination still exists against African Americans. In the same poll, more whites applied positive attributes to black Americans than negative ones, with black people describing whites even more highly, but a significant minority of whites still called African Americans "irresponsible", "lazy", or other such things.&lt;ref name=babington&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Sep22/0,4670,APYahooPollRaceinAmerica,00.html |title=Poll: Views still differ sharply by race |first=Charles |last=Babington |publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] |date=September 22, 2008 |access-date=January 16, 2010 |quote=[A] new Associated Press-Yahoo News poll, conducted with Stanford University, shows&amp;nbsp;... that a substantial portion of white Americans still harbor negative feelings toward black people.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Stanford University political scientist Paul Sniderman remarked that, in the modern U.S., racism and prejudices are "a deep challenge, and it's one that Americans in general, and for that matter, political scientists, just haven't been ready to acknowledge fully."&lt;ref name=babington /&gt;

In 2017, citizens gathered in the college community of [[Charlottesville]], Virginia to attend the [[Unite the Right rally]]. One woman was killed and dozens of other people were injured when a white supremacist [[Charlottesville car attack|drove his car into a group of counter-protesters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/12/us/charlottesville-car-crash-suspect-idd/index.html |title=Charlottesville car crash suspect ID'd as 20-year-old Ohio man|first=Chuck|last=Johnston|publisher=CNN|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813011757/http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/12/us/charlottesville-car-crash-suspect-idd/index.html|archive-date=August 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vice President [[Mike Pence]] condemned the violence by stating, "We have no tolerance for hate and violence from white supremacists, neo-Nazis or the KKK. These dangerous fringe groups have no place in American public life and in the American debate and we condemn them in the strongest possible terms."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/13/us/charlottesville-white-nationalist-rally-car-crash/index.html|title=Charlottesville white nationalist rally: What we know|first1=Holly |last1=Yan |first2=Devon M. |last2=Sayers |first3=Steve|last3=Almasy|work=CNN|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alleviation ==
{{main|Anti-racism}}
There is a wide plethora of societal and political suggestions to alleviate the effects of continued discrimination in the United States. For example, within universities, it has been suggested that a type of committee could respond to non-sanctionable behavior.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt;

It is also argued that there is a need for "white students and faculty to reformulate white-awareness toward a more secure identity that is not threatened by black cultural institutions and can recognize the racial non-neutrality of the institutions which whites dominate" (Brown, 334). Paired with this effort, Brown encourages the increase in minority faculty members, so the embedded white normative experience begins to fragment.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt;

Within the media, it is found that racial cues prime [[Ethnic stereotype|racial stereotypic thought]]. Thus, it is argued that "stereotype inconsistent cues might lead to more intentioned thought, thereby suppressing racial priming effects."&lt;ref name=Valentino /&gt; Social psychologists, such as [[Jennifer Eberhardt]], have done work that indicates such priming effects subconsciously help determine attitudes and behavior toward individuals regardless of intentions. These results have been incorporated into training, for example, in some police departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scott |first1=Sam |title=A Hard Look at How We See Race |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=37–41 |url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/a_hard_look_at_how_we_see_race |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623180420/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/a_hard_look_at_how_we_see_race |url-status=dead |archive-date=2018-06-23 |access-date=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued that more evidence-based guidance from psychologists and sociologists is needed in order for people to learn what is effective in alleviating racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Radford |first1=Benjamin |author-link=Benjamin Radford|title=Critical Thinking Approaches to Confronting Racism |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=1 |page=31 |url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/critical_thinking_approaches_to_confronting_racism |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180622191042/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/critical_thinking_approaches_to_confronting_racism |url-status=dead |archive-date=2018-06-22 |access-date=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such evidence-based approaches can reveal, for example, the many psychological biases to which humans are subject, such as [[In-group favoritism|ingroup bias]] and the [[fundamental attribution error]], which can underlie racist attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Foster |first1=Craig |last2=Samuels |first2=Steven|title=Psychology, Skepticism, and Confronting Racism |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=32–33 |url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/psychology_skepticism_and_confronting_racism |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623185156/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/psychology_skepticism_and_confronting_racism |url-status=dead |archive-date=2018-06-23 |access-date=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Stuart Vyse]] has argued that argument, ideas, and facts will not mend divisions but there is evidence, such as that which is provided by the [[Realistic conflict theory#Robbers cave study|Robbers Cave Experiment]], that seeking shared goals can help alleviate racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vyse |first1=Stuart|author-link=Stuart Vyse |title=Combating Racism through Shared Goals |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=34–35 |url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/combating_racism_through_shared_goals |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623182447/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/combating_racism_through_shared_goals |url-status=dead |archive-date=2018-06-23 |access-date=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
