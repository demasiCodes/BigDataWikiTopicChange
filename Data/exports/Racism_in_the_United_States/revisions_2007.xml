'''Racism in the United States''' has been a major issue in America since the colonial era. Historically, the country has been dominated by a [[settler|settler society]] of religiously and ethnically diverse [[whites]]. Major racially structured institutions include slavery, settlement, Indian reservations, segregation, residential schools (for American Indians), and internment camps. Racial stratification has occurred in employment, housing, education and government. Although racial discrimination was largely criminalized in the mid-20th century, major inequalities persist. 

The heaviest burdens of [[racism]] in the country have fallen upon [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], [[Asian Americans|Asian]]s, [[African American]]s, [[Latin Americans]] and some other [[Immigration to the United States|immigrant groups]] and their descendants. Racist attitudes, or [[prejudice]], are still held by substantial portions of the population. Members of every American ethnic group have perceived racism in their dealings with other groups.

==History by targeted racial group==
===Racism against Native Americans===
{{main|Native Americans in the United States}}

Hundreds of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native peoples]] made up of millions of individuals occupied the lands that would become the United States of America. During the colonial and independent periods, a long series of [[Indian Wars]] were fought with the primary objective of obtaining much of North America as territory of the U.S. Through [[List of wars|wars]], [[massacre]], the intentional ([[Pontiac's Rebellion#Siege of Fort Pitt|Siege of Fort Pitt]]) and unintentional spread of [[infectious disease|disease]], [[population transfer|forced displacement]] (such as in the [[Trail of Tears]]), restriction of food rights, and the imposition of treaties, land was taken and numerous hardships imposed. Ideologies justifying the context included stereotypes of Native Americans as "merciless Indian savages" (as described in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]) and the quasi-religious doctrine of [[Manifest Destiny]] which asserted divine blessing for U.S. conquest of all lands west of the Atlantic seaboard to the Pacific. The most rapid invasion occurred in the [[California gold rush]], the first two years of which saw the deaths of tens of thousands of Indians. Following the 1848 American [[invasion]], Native Californians were [[Indian slavery|enslaved]] in the new state from statehood in 1850 to 1867.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward D. Castillo|Castillo, Edward D.]] (1998). ''[http://www.ceres.ca.gov/nahc/califindian.html Short Overview of California Indian History]", California Native American Heritage Commission.&lt;/ref&gt;

Military and civil resistance by Native Americans has been a constant feature of American history. So too have a variety of debates around issues of sovereignty, the upholding of treaty provisions, and the civil rights of Native Americans under U.S. law.

====Discrimination, marginalization====
Once their territories were incorporated into the United States, surviving Native Americans were denied equality before the law and often treated as wards of the state. {{Verify source|date=May 2007}} Many Native Americans were relegated to reservations--constituting just 4% of U.S. territory--and the treaties signed with them violated. Tens of thousands of American Indians and Alaska Natives were forced to attend a [[Indian boarding schools|residential school system]] which sought to reeducate them in white settler American values, culture and economy--to "kill the Indian, sav[ing] the man."&lt;ref&gt;Ward Churchill, ''Kill the Indian, Save the Man'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Further dispossession continued through concessions for industries such as oil, mining and timber and through division of land through legislation such as the Allotment Act. These concessions have raised problems of consent, exploitation of low royalty rates, environmental injustice, and gross mismanagement of funds held in trust, resulting in the loss of $10-40 billion.&lt;ref&gt;United States Senate, [http://www.indiantrust.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=OtherMedia.ViewDetail&amp;Other_id=12&amp;Month=3&amp;Year=2007 Oversight Hearing on Trust Fund Litigation, Cobell v. Kempthorne]. See also, [[Cobell v. Norton]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Worldwatch Institute notes that 317 reservations are threatened by environmental hazards, while [[Western Shoshone]] land has been subjected to more than 1,000 nuclear explosions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Winona LaDuke]], ''All Our Relations: Native Struggles for Land and Life'', 1999, p. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

While formal equality has been legally granted, [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], [[Alaska Natives]], [[Native Hawaiians]], and [[Pacific Islanders]] remain among the most economically disadvantaged groups in the country, and suffer from high levels of alcoholism and suicide. {{Or|date=May 2007}}

===Racism against African Americans===
{{main|African American history}}

====Slavery and emancipation====
In colonial America, before [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] became completely based on racial lines, thousands of African slaves served European colonists, alongside other Europeans serving a term of [[indentured servitude]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/ashorthistory/archive/intro99.shtml The curse of Cromwell]&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases for African slaves, a term of service meant freedom and a land grant afterward, but these were rarely awarded, and few former slaves became landowners this way.{{Fact|date=May 2007}} In a precursor to the American Revolution, [[Nathaniel Bacon]] led a [[Bacon's Rebellion|revolt]] in 1676 against the Governor of [[Virginia]] and the system of exploitation he represented: exploitation of poorer colonists by the increasingly wealthy landowners where poorer people, regardless of skin color, fought side by side. However, Bacon died, probably of [[dysentery]]; hundreds of participants in the revolt were lured to disarm by a promised [[amnesty]]; and the revolt lost steam.&lt;ref name="worldbook-nb"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | year = 1992 | title = Bacon, Nathaniel | encyclopedia = The World Book Encyclopedia | publisher = World Book | id = ISBN 0-7166-0092-7 |pages = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Slaves''' were primarily used for [[agriculture|agricultural]] labor, notably in the production of [[cotton]] and [[tobacco]]. Black slavery in the Northeast was less common, usually confined to involuntary domestic servitude. In both regions, only the wealthiest Americans owned slaves.{{Fact|date=May 2007}} In contrast, poor whites recognized that slavery devalued their own labor. The social rift along color lines soon became ingrained in every aspect of colonial American culture.{{Fact|date=May 2007}} Approximately one Southern family in four held slaves prior to war. According to the 1860 U.S. census, about 385,000 individuals (i.e. 1.4% of [[white Americans]] in the country, or 4.8% of southern whites) owned one or more slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americancivilwar.com/authors/black_slaveowners.htm Black Slaveowners]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southernhistory.net/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=9406&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0 Southern History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Constitution had banned the importation of new African slaves in 1808, and in 1820 slave trade was equated with piracy, punishable
by death,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pdavis.nl/SlaverBackground.htm The legal and diplomatic background to the seizure of foreign vessels]&lt;/ref&gt; the practice of chattel slavery still existed for the next half century. All slaves in only the areas of the [[Confederate States of America]] that were not under direct control of the United States government were declared free by the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which was issued on [[January 1]], [[1863]] by President [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=34 Emancipation Proclamation (1863)]&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] did not apply to areas loyal to, or controlled by, the Union, thus the document only freed slaves where the Union still had not regained the legitimacy to do so. Slavery was not actually abolished in the United States until the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] which was declared ratified on [[December 6]], [[1865]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/amend1.htm#13 XIII - Slavery Abolished] The Avalon Project&lt;/ref&gt;  

About 4 million [[African American|black]] [[slavery|slaves]] were freed in 1865. Ninety-five percent of blacks lived in the South, comprising one third of the population there as opposed to one percent of the population of the North. Consequently, fears of eventual emancipation were much greater in the South than in the North.&lt;ref&gt;James McPherson, Drawn with the Sword, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all [[white American|white]] males aged 13 to 43 died in the civil war, including 6% in the North and an extraordinary 18% in the South.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/050155.html The Deadliest War]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, post-emancipation America was not free from racism; discriminatory practices continued in the United States with the existence of [[Jim Crow laws]], educational disparities and widespread criminal acts against people of color.

====Nadir of American race relations====
{{main|Nadir of American race relations |Mass racial violence in the United States}}
[[Image:Lynching-of-will-james.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The circus-style [[lynching in the United States|lynching]] of Will James, Cairo, Illinois, 1909.]]

The new century saw a hardening of institutionalized racism and legal discrimination against citizens of African descent in the United States. Although technically able to vote, [[poll tax]]es, acts of terror (often perpetuated by groups such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]], founded in the [[Reconstruction]] South), and discriminatory laws such as [[grandfather clause]]s kept black Americans disenfranchised particularly in the South but nationwide following the [[Rutherford B. Hayes|Hayes]] election at the end of the [[Reconstruction]] era in 1877. In response to [[de jure]] racism, protest and lobbyist groups emerged, most notably, the [[NAACP]] (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) in 1909.

This time period is sometimes referred to as the [[nadir of American race relations]] because racism in the United States was worse during this time than at any period before or since. [[Racial segregation|Segregation]], [[racial discrimination]], and expressions of white supremacy all increased. So did anti-black violence, including [[lynchings]] and [[race riot]]s.

In addition, racism which had been viewed primarily as a problem in the Southern states, burst onto the national consciousness following the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], the relocation of millions of African Americans from their roots in the Southern states to the industrial centers of the North after World War I, particularly in cities such as [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], and [[New York City|New York]] ([[Harlem]]). In northern cities, racial tensions exploded, most violently in Chicago, and [[lynching in the United States|lynchings]]--mob-directed hangings, usually racially motivated--increased dramatically in the 1920s.

====American Civil Rights movement====
{{main|American Civil Rights movement}}
[[Image:1963 march lincoln memorial.jpg|230px|thumb|right|Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial]]
Prominent African American politicians, entertainers and activists pushed for civil rights throughout the twentieth century, quite noticeably during the 1930s and 1940s with noted allies including [[First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], who facilitated singer [[Marian Anderson]]'s famous 1939 [[Easter]] concert when segregated venues would not accommodate her.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/tmirhfee.html February 26, 1939 Eleanor Roosevelt Resigns from the Daughters of the American Revolution]," Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Activists, particularly [[A. Philip Randolph]] agitated for civil rights throughout the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]] years, organizing protest marches and seeking government concessions. The efforts of civil rights activists began to bear fruit with the issuance of wartime [[Executive Order 8802]], signed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on [[June 25]], [[1941]] to prohibit [[racism|racial discrimination]] in the national [[Defense contractor|defense industry]]. &lt;ref&gt;Ronald Takaki, ''A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America'' (New York: Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1993), 397.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was followed by [[Executive Order 9981]] by President [[Harry S. Truman]] in July 1948, which banned [[racial segregation]] in the [[United States of America|American]] armed forces, and the creation of the [[U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] in 1957. The 1950s and 1960s saw the peaking of the American [[Civil Rights Movement]] and the desegregation of schools under the [[1954]] [[Supreme Court]] case [[Brown v. Board]] and the organizing of widespread protests across the nation under a younger generation of leaders.&lt;ref name=Takaki-CivRights&gt;Ronald Takaki, ''A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America'' (New York: Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1993), 400-414.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pastor and activist [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] was the catalyst for many [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] protests in the 1960s which led to the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].&lt;ref name=PivenCloward&gt;Frances Fox Piven and Richard A. Cloward, ''Poor People’s Movements: Why They Succeed, How They Fail'' (New York: Vintage Books, 1979 [1977]), ch. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This signified a change in the social acceptance of legislative racism in America and a profound increase in the number of opportunities available for people of color in the United States.&lt;ref name=PivenCloward /&gt; While substantial gains were made in the succeeding decades through middle class advancement and public employment, black poverty and lack of education&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jbhe.com/latest/122905_statistical_shocker2005.html JBHE Statistical Shocker of the Year]&lt;/ref&gt; deepened in the context of de-industrialization.&lt;ref name=Takaki-CivRights /&gt;

===Discrimination against Latin Americans===
Americans of Latin American ancestry (often categorized as "[[Hispanic]]") come from a wide variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds; however, Latin Americans have often been viewed as a monolithic group by other Americans. Latinos are often portrayed as passionate, sex symbols or violent in literature, films, television, and music. {{Or|date=May 2007}} Furthermore, recent increases in illegal Hispanic immigration have spurred anti-Latino sentiment, particularly in areas of the United States that have previously seen few Hispanic immigrants. {{Or|date=May 2007}} Due to the diversity of backgrounds encountered in the Hispanic population of the United States, racist policies have varied widely. {{Or|date=May 2007}} The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] granted Mexicans in the territories acquired after the [[Mexican-American War]] access to United States citizenship and legal status. For example, [[Leander Perez]]'s ancestors were compiled mainly of [[Islenos]] people who immigrated to the New Orleans area in the late 1700s, yet Leander had the appearance of and was considered by just about everyone to be a white man. Many Cuban Americans, particularly those from the exile generation that arrived immediately after the Communist takeover of the island, are also largely integrated into American society. {{Or|date=May 2007}}

===West Coast racism===
In the Pacific states, racism was primarily directed against the resident Indian and Latino peoples, Asian immigrants, and black (African-American) populations. Several immigration laws discriminated against the Asians, and at different points the ethnic Chinese or other groups were banned from entering the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/learn/features/immig/chinese6.html Immigration...Chinese:Exclusion]&lt;/ref&gt; Nonwhites were prohibited from testifying against whites, a prohibition extended to the Chinese by [[People v. Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cetel.org/1854_hall.html Text of People v. Hall decision]&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese were generally subject to harder labor on the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] and often performed the more dangerous tasks such as using dynamite to make pathways through the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Takaki, ''A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America'' (New York: Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1993), 196-98.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[San Francisco Vigilance Movement]], although ostensibly a response to crime and corruption, also systematically victimized Irish immigrants, and later this was transformed  into mob violence against Chinese immigrants. {{Fact|date=May 2007}} Legal discrimination of Asian minorities was furthered with the passages of the [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882]], which banned the entrance of virtually all ethnic Chinese immigrants into the United States until 1943. During World War II, the United States created [[Japanese American internment|internment camps for Japanese American citizens]] in fear that they would be used as spies for the Japanese. This was also done with [[Italian American]] populations in the East.

A variety of laws were enacted to prevent African American migration to the [[Pacific Northwest]]. While slavery was criminalized in the [[Oregon Territory]] in 1844, a so-called [[lash law]] required that all blacks (slave or free) be whipped twice annually was enacted in June of that year. An exclusion law, barring African Americans from entering the territory was passed in 1847, repealed in 1854, and added to the new Oregon state constitution in 1857. While African Americans have been present at some level since 1805, the demographic reverberations of these laws remain today.&lt;ref name=BlackTimeline&gt;[http://www.endoftheoregontrail.org/blaktime.html Timeline of Black History in the Pacific Northwest]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Zoot Suit Riots]] were vivid incidents of racial violence against Latinos in [[Los Angeles]] in 1943. Naval servicemen stationed in a Latino neighborhood conflicted with youth in the dense neighborhood. Frequent confrontations between small groups and individuals had intensified into several days of non-stop rioting. Large mobs of servicemen would enter civilian quarters looking to attack Mexican American youths, some of whom were wearing [[zoot suit]]s, a distinctive exaggerated fashion popular among that group.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Griswold del Castillo, "The Los Angeles "Zoot Suit Riots" Revisited: Mexican and Latin American Perspectives," ''Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos'', Vol. 16, No. 2. (Summer, 2000), pp. 367-391.&lt;/ref&gt; The disturbances continued unchecked, and even assisted, by the local police for several days before based commanders declared downtown  Los Angeles and Mexican American neighborhoods off-limits to servicemen.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur C. Verge, "The Impact of the Second World War on Los Angeles," The Pacific Historical Review, Vol. 63, No. 3, Fortress California at War: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Diego, 1941-1945. (Aug., 1994), pp. 306-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

===Hate crimes and crime between races===

Most hate crimes in the United States target victims on the basis of race or ethnicity (for Federal purposes, crimes targeting Hispanics based on that identity are considered based on ethnicity). Leading forms of bias cited in the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, based on law enforcement agency filings are: anti-black, anti-Jewish, anti-white, anti-homosexual, and anti-Hispanic bias in that order in both 2004 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2004/openpage.htm Hate Crime Statistics, 2004]. [http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2005/index.html Hate Crime Statistics, 2005].&lt;/ref&gt; There are more hate crimes against whites than against Hispanics, Asians, American-Indians and multiple-race groups. By contrast, the National Criminal Victimization Survey, finds that per capita rates of hate crime victimization varied little by race or ethnicity, and the differences are not statistically significant.&lt;ref&gt;[www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/hcrvp.pdf Hate Crime Reported by Victims
and Police], Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report, November 2005, NCJ 209911.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Justice]] compiles statistics on crime by race, but only between and among people categorized as black or white. These statistics state that of more than 6.6 million violent crimes (murder, rape, assault and robbery) are committed in the [[United States]] each year, about 20% occur between white offenders and black victims or black offenders and white victims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.nbc15online.com/forums/thread/1695280.aspx The Sydney Morning Herald]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, there were more than 645,000 victims of cross-racial violent crimes between blacks and whites in the U.S. In 90 percent of those crimes, black offenders attacked white victims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sullivan-county.com/wcva/liberal_racism.htm Are facts racism?]&lt;/ref&gt; In their analysis of these statistics, the New Century Foundation, a pro-white racialist analysis group founded by [[Jared Taylor]], argues that black crime and racial animus towards whites are to blame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nc-f.org/colorcrime1999.htm The Color of Crime], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Other analysts are sharply critical of the NCF's findings, referring to the criminological mainstream view that "Racial and ethnic data must be treated with caution. ... Existing research on crime has generally shown that racial or ethnic identity is not predictive of criminal behavior with data which has been controlled for social and economic factors."&lt;ref&gt;Preface to Minnesota's official crime data reports, quoted in Southern Poverty Law Center, [http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=255 Coloring Crime].&lt;/ref&gt; NCF's methodology and statistics are further sharply criticize as flawed and deceptive by anti-racist activists Tim Wise and the Southern Poverty Law Center.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Wise, "[http://www.lipmagazine.org/~timwise/colorofdeception.html The Color of Deception: Race, Crime and Sloppy Social Science]," 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Southern Poverty Law Center, [http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=255 Coloring Crime].&lt;/ref&gt;

On Saturday, [[January 6]] [[2007]], [[Channon Christian]], 21, and [[Christopher Newsom]], 23, of Knoxville, Tennessee, went on a date from which they would never return. On their way to the home of another couple, they were carjacked and kidnapped. Over the next 24 hours they were beaten, gang-[[raped]], [[tortured]], and [[murdered]]. Some commentators complained that the murders highlighted a double standard in American journalism: that if Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom had been black and their killers white, their story would have received more attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jacksonville.com/apnews/stories/051707/D8P6ED601.shtml Critics say news media ignoring Knoxville couple slaying]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antisemitism===
{{main|Antisemitism}}
[[Antisemitism]] has also played a role in America. During the late 1800s and early 1900s, hundreds of thousands of [[Ashkenazi]] [[Jews]] were escaping the [[pogroms]] of [[Russia]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. They boarded boats from ports on the Baltic Sea and in Northern [[Germany]], and largely arrived at [[Ellis Island]], [[New York]].&lt;ref name=Takaki-JewishMigr&gt;Ronald Takaki, ''A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America'' (New York: Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1993), 277-283.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought by [[Leo Rosten]], in his book, '[[The Joys of Yiddish]]', that as soon as they left the boat, they were subject to racism from the port immigration authorities. The derogatory term '[[kike]]' was adopted when referring to Jews (because they often could not write so they may have signed their immigration papers with circles - or kikel in [[Yiddish]]).&lt;ref&gt;Rosten, Leo (1968) "The Joys of Yiddish"&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1910s, the Southern Jewish communities were attacked by the [[Ku Klux Klan]], who objected to Jewish immigration, and often used 'The Jewish Banker' in their propaganda. In 1915, [[Texas]]-born, [[New York]] [[Jew]] [[Leo Frank]] was lynched by the newly re-formed Klan, after being convicted of rape and sentenced to death (his punishment was commuted to life imprisonment).&lt;ref name="lynching openly organized"&gt;Phagan, 1987, p. 27, states that "everyone knew the identity of the lynchers" (putting the words in her father's mouth). Oney, 2003, p. 526, quotes Carl Abernathy as saying, "They'd go to a man's office and talk to him or ... see a man on the job and talk to him," and an unidentified lyncher as saying "The organization of the body was more open than mysterious."&lt;/ref&gt;

The events in [[Nazi Germany]] also attracted attention from America. Jewish lobbying for intervention in Europe drew opposition from the [[isolationists]], amongst whom was Father [[Charles Coughlin]], a well known radio priest, who was known to be critical of Jews, believing that they were leading America into the war.&lt;ref name"Coughlin"&gt;[http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/53/coughlin.html Father Charles Edward Coughlin (1891-1971)] By Richard Sanders, Editor, Press for Conversion!&lt;/ref&gt; He preached in weekly, overtly [[anti-Semitic]] sermons and, from 1936, began publication of a newspaper, Social Justice, in which he printed anti-Semitic accusations such as [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]].&lt;ref name="Coughlin"&gt;Mary Christine Athans, "A New Perspective on Father Charles E. Coughlin," ''Church History'', Vol. 56, No. 2. (Jun., 1987), pp. 224-235.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Jewish organizations, Christian organizations, Muslim organizations, and academics consider the [[Nation of Islam]] to be [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]]. Specifically, they claim that the Nation of Islam has engaged in revisionist and antisemitic interpretations of the Holocaust and exaggerates the role of Jews in the African slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~antis/papers/occasional.papers.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) alleges that NOI Health Minister, Abdul Alim Muhammad, has accused Jewish doctors of injecting blacks with the [[AIDS]] virus,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adl.org/focus_sheets/focus_islam.asp&lt;/ref&gt; an allegation that Dr. Abdul Alim Muhammad has denied.

===Racism against Arabs and Muslims ===
{{main|Anti-Arabism|Islamophobia}}
Racism against [[Arab Americans]]&lt;ref name=Leonard&gt;Leonard, Karen. University of California, Irvine. Western Knight Center. "American Muslims:South Asian Contributions to the Mix." 2005. [[July 28]] [[2007]]. [http://www.wkconline.org/resources/pdf/2005muslim_SAsian_Muslims.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; may rise concomittantly with tensions between the American government and the Arab world.  Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the United States, discrimination and racialized violence has markedly increased against Arab Americans and many other religious and cultural groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/usahate/usa1102.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
Public opinion polls and think tank observers also note a "backlash" against Muslims and Arabs since 2001, with 34% of Americans reporting recently hearing prejudiced remarks about Islam and 25% assessing themselves as prejudiced against Arabs.&lt;ref name=Poll2006&gt; Claudia Deane and Darryl Fears, "[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/08/AR2006030802221.html Negative Perception Of Islam Increasing]," ''Washington Post'', [[March 9]] [[2006]]. Note that the Arab prejudice statistic is in the accompanying poll data.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Iraqis in particular were demonized which led to hatred towards Arabs and Iranians living in the United States and elsewhere in the [[western world]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freepress.org/departments/display/13/2004/814&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soundvision.com/info/peace/demonization.asp&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been attacks against Arabs not only on the basis of their religion ([[Islam]]), but also on the basis of their ethnicity;  numerous Christian Arabs have been attacked based on their appearances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/niot/citizens_respond/losaltos.html Attacks on Arab Americans] (PBS)&lt;/ref&gt;In addition, non-Arabs who are mistaken for Arabs because of perceived "similarities in appearance" have been collateral victims of anti-Arabism. [[Persian people]] (who constitute a completely different set of ethnic groups than Arabs), as well as [[South Asians]] of different ethnic/religious backgrounds (Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs) have been stereotyped as "Arabs". The case of [[Balbir Singh Sodhi]], a Sikh who was murdered at a Phoenix gas station by a [[white supremacist]] for "looking like an Arab terrorist" (because of the turban that is a requirement of [[Sikhism]]), as well as that of Hindus being attacked for "being Muslims" have achieved prominence and criticism following the September 11 attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/11/25/national/main530749.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/presrele/hatcr_51/4277_51.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;

Parts of [[Hollywood]] are regarded as using a disproportionate number of Arabs as villains and of depicting Arabs negatively and stereotypically. According to Godfrey Cheshire, a critic on the New York Press, "the only vicious racial stereotype that's not only still permitted but actively endorsed by Hollywood" is that of Arabs as crazed terrorists.&lt;ref name="Whitaker"&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Whitaker |authorlink=Brian Whitaker |title=The 'towel-heads' take on Hollywood |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,355880,00.html |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=[[2000-08-11]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hussein Ibish]], former Communications Director of the [[American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee]], writes that all Hollywood portrayals of Arabs fall under one of "the three B's": bombers, belly dancers, or billionaires. In Hollywood, Arabs have been portrayed as terrorists and women abusers, and Arabs as extremist people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adc.org/index.php?id=2357&lt;/ref&gt;

Some western movies portray Arab Muslims similar to how Nazi-inspired movies portrayed Jews. Like the image of Jews in fascist Germany, the image of Arabs is that of "money-grubbing caricatures that sought
world domination, worshipped a different God, killed innocents, and lusted after blond virgins." &lt;ref name="Hollywood1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shaheen |first=Jack G. |authorlink=Jack Shaheen |year=2000 |title=Hollywood's Muslim Arabs |journal=The Muslim World |volume=90 |issue=1–2 |pages=22–42 |issn=0027-4909 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.2000.tb03680.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2000 film [[Rules of Engagement (film)|Rules of Engagement]] drew criticism from Arab groups, described as "probably the most racist film ever made against Arabs by Hollywood" by the ADC.&lt;ref name="Whitaker"/&gt; Paul Clinton of the [[Boston Globe]] wrote "at its worst, it's blatantly racist, using Arabs as cartoon-cutout bad guys".&lt;ref name="Whitaker"/&gt;

Of those, only a dozen were positive and 50 were balanced. Shaheen writes that "[Arab] stereotypes are deeply ingrained in American cinema. From 1896 until today, filmmakers have collectively indicted all Arabs as Public Enemy #1 – brutal, heartless, uncivilized religious fanatics and money-mad cultural "others" bent on terrorizing civilized Westerners, especially [Christians] and [Jews].

===Racism against White Americans===
In the [[United States]], there have been crimes committed against whites on the basis of their ethnicity. According to columnist [[Earl Ofari Hutchinson]], FBI statistics indicate that more than 20% of hate crimes are committed by Blacks, and most of the victims of those crimes are white.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Coe, "[http://www.laweekly.com/news/news/long-beach-hate-crime/15346/ Long Beach Hate Crime: Many media stumble over a man-bites-dog story of black suspects and white victims]", ''[[LA Weekly]]'', [[January 3]], [[2007]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nation of Islam]], a religious and social/political organization with the self-proclaimed goal of improving the condition of the Black people in America, is regarded as racist, antisemitic&lt;ref&gt;http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~antis/papers/occasional.papers.html&lt;/ref&gt; and anti-white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.splcenter.org/intel/map/hate.jsp?T=32&amp;m=5|title= Active U.S. Hate Groups in 2006  |accessdate=2007-09-15 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racism towards Iranians spiked during the 1979 [[Iran hostage crisis|Tehran embassy hostage crisis]].

Since the 1980s and especially since the 1990s Hollywood's depiction of Iranians has gradually shown signs of vilifying Iranians.&lt;ref&gt;See detailed analysis in: ''The U.S. Media and the Middle East: Image and Perception''. Praeger, 1997; Greenwood, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood network productions such as ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' &lt;ref&gt;http://mediamatters.org/items/200702020015&lt;/ref&gt;, ''[[John Doe (TV series)|John Doe]]'', ''[[On Wings of Eagles]]'' (1986)&lt;ref&gt;http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE2DC163CF93BA25756C0A960948260&lt;/ref&gt;, ''[[Escape From Iran: The Canadian Caper]]'' (1981)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082339/&lt;/ref&gt;, and ''[[JAG]]'' almost regularly host Persian speaking villains in their storylines. In fact, on Friday, May 9, 1997, [[CBS]] aired an episode of [[JAG]] in which several [[Hamas]] terrorists take a Washington hospital under siege. According to the film, they spoke in fluent "Farsi" (or Persian), not "Arabic". {{Fact|date=September 2007}}

According to Kaveh Afrasiabi:
:"Hollywood's tall walls of exclusion and discrimination have yet to crumble when it comes to the movie industry's persistent misrepresentation of Iranians and their collective identity immersed in a long thread of history."&lt;ref&gt;"'Axis of evil' seeps into Hollywood". Asia Times. March 15, 2007. Link: [http://www.campaigniran.org/casmii/index.php?q=node/1646]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Hollywood's "stereotypical"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.Iranian.com/Opinion/Aug98/Media/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; and anti-Iranian movies include: ''[[The Peacemaker (1997 film)|The Peacemaker]]'' (in which a character, apparently without any context, says "fuck Iran"), ''[[The Hitman (film)|The Hitman]]'' (in which several mobs join together to demolish an Iranian mob operating in Canada), ''[[Madhouse (1990 film)|MadHouse]]'' (partially centering upon a wealthy Iranian who is in the process of divorcing his American wife. In one scene, the wife, speaking to her Iranian husband utters "you goddamn towel heads, sand rats"), ''[[The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!|The Naked Gun]]'', ''[[Under Siege]]'', ''[[The Delta Force (film)|The Delta Force]]'', ''[[Into the Night|Into the Night (1985)]]'', ''[[Down and Out in Beverly Hills]] (1985)'', ''[[Threads|Threads (1984)]]'', ''[[Who Dares Wins (film)|The Final Options (1983)]]'', ''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076715/ Silver Bears (1978)]''.

Among the more recent and controversial films are [[Not Without My Daughter]], ''Alexander'', and [[300 (film)|''300'']].

The 1991 film ''[[Not Without My Daughter]]'' was widely criticized for its portrayal of Iranian society. The film is based on the true story of [[Betty Mahmoody]], an American woman who traveled to Tehran with her young daughter to visit her Iranian-born husband's family. In the film, Mahmoody's husband undergoes a transformation in Iran. He becomes increasingly angry and abusive and eventually decides that he will not return to the United States. Betty is told that she can leave, but the couple's daughter will have to stay in Tehran. Ultimately, after 18 months in Iran, Betty and her daughter escape to the United States.

Several Western critics, including [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]'' and [[Caryn James]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', criticized the film for stereotyping Iranians as misogynistic and fanatical. According to Ebert, the film depicts Islamic society "in shrill terms," where women are "willing or unwilling captives of their men," deprived "of what in the West would be considered basic human rights." Further, Ebert says: "No attempt is made - deliberately, I assume - to explain the Muslim point of view, except in rigid sets of commands and rote statements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Not Without My Daughter|publisher=Chicago Sun Times|date=[[1991-01-11]]|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19910111/REVIEWS/101110303/1023|accessdate = 2007-03-20|authorlink = Roger Ebert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The New York Times|last=James|first=Caryn|title=Embrace the Stereotype; Kiss the Movie Goodbye|date=[[1991-01-27]]|accessdate=2007-03-20|url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?res=9D0CE3DE1630F934A15752C0A967958260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert then contends:

The 2004 film [[Alexander (film)|''Alexander'']], by American director [[Oliver Stone]], has been accused of negative and inaccurate portrayal of Persians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.Iranian.com/Parsi/2004/November/Alexander/index.html Trita Parsi, Oliver Stone's "Alexander" - ''Miserably Lousy'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/01/e840ee45-68ca-4718-bf39-c2f01168d738.html RadioFreeEurope - ''World: Oliver Stone's 'Alexander' Stirs Up Controversy'']&lt;/ref&gt; In the movie the Persians are portrayed as poor, gay, barbaric farmers that spend their time killing innocent neighbors. The movie was banned in Iran and some Arab nations but the movie still circulates in the Iranian [[black market]].

==Racism as a motivator in U.S. foreign policy==
[[United States foreign policy]] making was influenced from its early decades by racial concerns. While pursuing a series of expansionist wars (see "Racism against Native Americans" above), American leaders embraced and ideology of [[white supremacy|white racial supremacy]].  [[George Washington]] predicted at the end of the [[U.S. Revolutionary War]], “The gradual extension of our settlements will as certainly cause the savage, as the wolf, to retire; both being beasts of prey, tho' they differ in shape."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Noam Chomsky, ''Year 501: The Conquest Continues'', (Boston: South End Press, 1993), 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  The successful slave revolution in [[Haiti]] alarmed the United States leadership, and the country refused diplomatic recognition for decades. The United States conquest of [[Florida]] and the [[Seminole Wars]] were fought in part to confront the danger of "mingled hordes of lawless Indians and negroes," in the words of President John Quincy Adams.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Noam Chomsky, ''Year 501: The Conquest Continues'', (Boston: South End Press, 1993), 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The wars against the [[Barbary States|Muslims]] were launched by the administrations of [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]]. In 1801, Jefferson sent a group of frigates to defend American interests in the Mediterranean. On [[March 3]], [[1815]], the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] authorized deployment of naval power against [[Algiers]], and a force of ten ships was dispatched under the command of Commodores [[Stephen Decatur, Jr.]] and [[William Bainbridge]]. 

Early 20th-century President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] declared, "The most ultimately righteous of all wars is a war with savages" and openly spoke of cementing the rule of "dominant world races."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Noam Chomsky, ''Year 501: The Conquest Continues'', (Boston: South End Press, 1993), 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics such as [[Gore Vidal]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] have suggested that racism has played a significant role in U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East and its treatment of the Arabs. Various critics have suggested that racism along with strategic and financial interests motivated the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush Administration]] to attack Iraq even though the [[Baath]]ist regime of [[Saddam Hussein]] did not possess weapons of mass destruction nor had any ties to [[Al Qaida]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://.www.merip.org/mero/interventions/lockman_interv.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://.www.mediamonitors.net/kristenschurr1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://.www.query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E6DA153BF93BA35750C0A964948260]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minority racism==  
{{weasel}}

Minority racism is sometimes considered controversial because of theories of [[power (sociology)|power]] in society. Some theories of racism insist that racism can only exist in the context of social power to impose it upon others.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Catherine A. Hansman,  Leon Spencer,  Dale Grant,  Mary Jackson, "Beyond Diversity: Dismantling Barriers in Education," ''Journal of Instructional Psychology'', March 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Racist thinking, or [[prejudice]], among and between minority groups does occur, for example conflicts between blacks and Koreans (notably in the [[1992 Los Angeles Riots]]) or between blacks and Jews (such as the [[Crown Heights Riot|riots in Crown Heights]] in 1991&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recomnetwork.org/articles/01/08/16/0254240.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;) in various urban environments, new immigrant groups (such as Latinos&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=902]&lt;/ref&gt;) or towards whites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michnews.com/artman/publish/article_12516.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?/base/news-4/1137481512176100.xml]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been called the Mexican "reconquista"(re-conquest) whose name was inspired by the Spanish "reconquista" which led to the expulsion of the [[Moors]] from Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aztlan.net]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Black Nationalist]] [[Nation of Islam]] is regarded as racist, anti-Semitic and anti-white.{{Fact|date=August 2007}} Black nationalists have been known to propagate [[Afrocentric]] [[pseudohistory]] in order to emphasize perceived "black superiority" over whites.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

In the state of [[Hawaii]], where [[Polynesian]]s and [[Asian]]s make up the majority of the population, there is racial tension against whites. Though the Hawaiian word ''ha'ole'' originally referred to any non-Hawaiian, it is used by some Hawaiian natives as a pejorative term to refer to whites. Hawaii still has a segregated school system, [[Kamehameha Schools]], where enrollment is limited to native Hawaiians. Its exclusionary admissions policy has been the subject of several lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-03-06-hawaii-cover_N.htm Racial tensions are simmering in Hawaii's melting pot]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to gang experts and law enforcement agents, a longstanding race war between the [[Mexican Mafia]] and the Black Guerilla family, a rival [[African American]] [[prison gang]], has generated such intense racial hatred among Mexican Mafia leaders, or shot callers, that they have issued a "green light" on all blacks. A sort of gang-life fatwah, this amounts to a standing authorization for Latino gang members to prove their mettle by terrorizing or even murdering any blacks sighted in a neighborhood claimed by a gang loyal to the Mexican Mafia.[http://www.blackamericaweb.com/site.aspx/bawnews/stateof/hutchinson105]

==Stereotypes and prejudice==

{{Expand|date=October 2007}}
[[Image:1900sc Mammy Card Interracial.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This racist [[postcard]] from the 1900s shows the casual denigration of black women. It states "I know you're not particular to a fault / Though I'm not sure you'll never be sued for assault / You're so fond of women that even a wench / Attracts your gross fancy despite her strong stench"]]
One key symbol of racism against African Americans was the use of [[blackface]].

==Segregation and integration==
{{main|Racial segregation}}
{{Expand|date=October 2007}}

The [[Jim Crow Laws]] were state and local laws enacted in the [[Southern United States|Southern]] and [[Border states (Civil War)|border states]] of the [[United States]] and enforced between 1876 and 1965. They mandated "[[separate but equal]]" status for black Americans. In reality, this led to treatment and accommodations that were almost always inferior to those provided to [[white American]]s.  The most important laws required that public schools, public places and public transportation, like trains and buses, have separate facilities for whites and blacks.  (These Jim Crow Laws were separate from the 1800-66 [[Black Codes in the USA|Black Codes]], which had restricted the [[civil rights]] and civil liberties of African Americans.)  State-sponsored school segregation was declared unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1954 in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''. Generally, the remaining Jim Crow laws were overruled by the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act]]; none were in effect at the end of the 1960s.

==Institutional racism==
[[Institutional racism]] is the theory that aspects of the structure, pervasive attitudes, and established institutions of society disadvantage some racial groups, although not by an overtly discriminatory mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eraseracismny.org/html/whatis/whatis.php What is Institutional and Structural Racism?] ERASE RACISM&lt;/ref&gt; There are several factors that play into institutional racism, including but not limited to: accumulated wealth/benefits from racial groups that have benefited from past discrimination, educational and occupational disadvantages faced by non-native English speakers in the United States, ingrained stereotypical images that still remain in the society (e.g. black men are likely to be criminals).&lt;ref&gt;Bullock III, C. S. &amp; Rodgers Jr., H. R. (1976) "Institutional Racism: Prerequisites, Freezing, and Mapping". ''Phylon'' 37 (3), 212-223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some established societal institutions are taking steps to combat the alleged structural disadvantages in modern American society, particularly in the case of non-native English speakers or those raised in homes that spoke broken or pidgin English. {{Or|date=May 2007}} Several states are attempting to reduce these educational disadvantages by developing a more multiculturally-aware curriculum. For example, the 2005 [[California]] 6th grade statewide examination contained the question ''Patio comes from the Spanish word meaning what?''. Including questions such as these provide opportunities for non-native speakers of English to have greater educational access. {{Or|date=May 2007}}

===Immigration===
Access to United States [[citizenship]] was restricted by race, beginning with the [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] which refused naturalization to "non-whites."  Many in the modern United States forget the institutionalized prejudice against white followers of [[Roman Catholicism]] who immigrated from [[Ireland]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhc.rtp.nc.us/tserve/nineteen/nkeyinfo/nromcath.htm Roman Catholics and Immigration in Nineteenth-Century America] by Julie Byrne, Dept. of Religion, Duke University, National Humanities Center&lt;/ref&gt; Other efforts include the 1882 [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] and the 1924 [[National Origins Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=47 Chinese Exclusion Act (1882)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicaldocuments.com/ImmigrationActof1924.htm Immigration Act of 1924] HistoricalDocuments.com&lt;/ref&gt; The Immigration Act of 1924 was aimed at further restricting the [[Southern Europe|Southern]] and [[Eastern Europe]]ans who had begun to enter the country in large numbers beginning in the [[1890s]]. While officially prohibited, U.S. officials continue to differentially apply laws on illegal immigration depending on national origin (essentially declining to enforce immigration laws against citizens of rich countries who overstay their visas) and personal economy (differentially awarding visas to foreign nationals based on bank accounts, properties and so on).

===Wealth creation===
Massive racial differentials in account of wealth remain in the United States: betweens whites and African Americans, the gap is a factor of ten.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M. Shapiro, ''The Hidden Cost of Being African American: How Wealth Perpetuates Inequality'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; An analyst of the phenomenon, Thomas Shapiro, professor of law and social policy at Brandeis University argues, “The wealth gap is not just a story of merit and achievement, it’s also a story of the historical legacy of race in the United Sates.”&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in AP, "[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15704759/ Census report: Broad racial disparities persist]," Nov 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the institutions of wealth creation amongst American citizens were open exclusively to whites, notably land distributed under the [[Homestead Act]] and other settlement efforts in the West. Similar differentials applied to the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security Act]] (which excluded agricultural workers, a sector that then included most black workers), rewards to military officers, and the educational benefits offered returning soldiers after [[World War II]]. Pre-existing disparities in wealth are exacerbated by tax policies that reward investment over waged income, subsidize mortgages, and subsidize private sector developers.&lt;ref&gt;George Lipsitz, "[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-0678%28199509%2947%3A3%3C369%3ATPIIWR%3E2.0.CO%3B2-9 The Possessive Investment in Whiteness: Racialized Social Democracy and the "White" Problem in American Studies]," ''American Quarterly'', Vol. 47, No. 3. (Sep., 1995), pp. 369-387.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care inequality===
They are major racial differences in access to [[health care]] and in the quality of health care provided. A study published in the American Journal of Public Health estimated that: "over 886,000 deaths could have been prevented from 1991 to 2000 if African Americans had received the same care as whites." The key differences they cited were lack of insurance, inadequate [[health insurance|insurance]], poor service, and reluctance to seek care.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, S. H., Johnson, R. E., Fryer Jr, G. E., Rust, G., &amp; [[David Satcher|Satcher, D.]] (2004). "[http://www.ajph.org/cgi/content/abstract/94/12/2078 The Health Impact of Resolving Racial Disparities: An Analysis of US Mortality Data]". ''American Journal of Public Health'', 94 (12), 2078-2081.&lt;/ref&gt; A history of government-sponsored experimentation, such as the notorious [[Tuskegee Syphilis Study]] has left of legacy of African American distrust of the medical system.&lt;ref&gt;"The History of Black 'Paranoia',” ch. 3 of Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair, ''Whiteout: The CIA, Drugs, and the Press'', London: Verso, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Affirmative action==
{{main|Affirmative action in the United States}}
[[Affirmative action]] is a policy or program intended to promote access to education or employment for minority groups and women. Motivation for affirmative action policies is to redress the effects of past discrimination and to encourage public institutions such as universities, hospitals, and police forces to be more representative of the population.

Affirmative action programs may include targeted recruitment efforts, preferential treatment given to applicants from historically disadvantaged groups, and in some cases the use of quotas. Most American universities and some employers practice affirmative action.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

Some opponents of affirmative action view the greater access by women and minority groups to be at the expense of groups considered dominant (typically white men). In their view, these policies demonstrate an overt preference for applicants from particular backgrounds over equally-qualified (or better-qualified) candidates from other backgrounds. Some opponents of affirmative action believe the only consideration in choosing between applicants should be merit. Some also criticize affirmative action because they believe it perpetuates racial division instead of minimizing the importance of race in American society.&lt;ref&gt;''Cultural whiplash: the unforeseen consequences of America's crusade against racial discrimmination'' / Patrick Garry (2006) ISBN 1581825692&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of affirmative action believe that the perceived injustice to the dominant group is not supported by facts. They point to statistics that suggest that affirmative action has not resulted in fewer opportunities for white people. For example, white enrollment in universities has increased along with minority enrollment. In 1973, 30% of white high school graduates attended universities; in 1993, after wide-spread implementation of affirmative action policies, that number had risen to 42%.&lt;ref name=Myths&gt;http://www.iupui.edu/~aao/myths.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some supporters of affirmative action point out that, even in the absence of affirmative action, college admissions rarely are purely merit-based: athletes, musicians, and [[Legacy preferences|legacy students]] (children of [[Alumnus|alumni]]) have always been given preferential treatment. For example, [[Harvard University]] admits 35-40% of legacy applicants,&lt;ref name=Myths/&gt; and a rejected white applicant is more likely to have been displaced by a legacy student than by one who benefited from affirmative action.{{Fact|date=September 2007}} Some supporters of affirmative action note that affirmative action has helped white women more than any other group, yet resentment and lawsuits against affirmative action programs focus almost exclusively on minority gains.&lt;ref name=Myths/&gt;

==Current hate groups==   
{{main|Hate groups}}   
[[Supremacism|Supremacist]], separatist, racist, and hate groups still operate in the United States. The [[Ku Klux Klan]], the [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]], [[National Socialist Movement (United States)]], [[Aryan Nations]], [[Westboro Baptist Church]], [[Nation of Islam]], [[Nation of Aztlán]], [[Black Hebrew Israelites]], [[Nation of Yahweh]], and the [[White Order of Thule]] are among the institutions most commonly identified in this way. The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]]'s Intelligence Project counted 844 active hate groups in the United States in 2006.&lt;ref name="splc"&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/map/hate.jsp Active U.S. Hate Groups in 2006] Southern Poverty Law Center.
