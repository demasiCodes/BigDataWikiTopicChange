{{Segregation}}

'''Racism in the United States''' has been widespread since the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial era]]. Legally or socially sanctioned privileges and rights were given to [[white Americans]] but denied to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], [[African Americans]], [[Asian Americans]], and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]. [[European Americans]] (particularly the affluent [[white Anglo-Saxon Protestant]]s) were granted exclusive privileges in matters of education, immigration, voting rights, citizenship, land acquisition, and criminal procedure over periods of time extending from the 17th century to the 1960s. However, non-Protestant immigrants from Europe; particularly [[Irish people]], [[Poles]], and [[Italians]], suffered xenophobic exclusion and other forms of ethnicity-based discrimination in American society, were vilified as racially inferior, and were not considered fully white. In addition, [[Middle Eastern American]] groups like [[Jews]] and [[Arabs]] have faced continuous discrimination in the United States, and as a result, some people belonging to these groups do not identify as white. [[Asian Americans|East and South Asians]] have similarly faced racism in America.

Major racially and ethnically structured institutions included slavery, [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], the [[American Indian Wars]], [[Native American reservations]], [[Native American boarding schools]], immigration and naturalization law and [[internment camps]].&lt;ref&gt;Internment camps are particularly associated with World War II, but also occurred during World War I. Most significant was the [[Japanese American internment]] of 120,000 Japanese Americans during World War II. There was also internment of almost 11,000 German Americans in [[German American internment]] during World War II, and some [[Italian American internment]].&lt;/ref&gt; Formal racial discrimination was largely banned in the mid-20th century, and came to be perceived as socially unacceptable and/or morally repugnant as well. Racial politics remains a major phenomenon, and racism continues to be [[Racial inequality in the United States|reflected in socioeconomic inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;In his 2009 visit to the US, the [UN] Special Rapporteur on Racism noted that "Socio-economic indicators show that poverty and race and ethnicity continue to overlap in the United States. This reality is a direct legacy of the past, in particular slavery, segregation, the forcible resettlement of Native Americans, which was confronted by the United States during the civil rights movement. However, whereas the country managed to establish equal treatment and non-discrimination in its laws, it has yet to redress the socioeconomic consequences of the historical legacy of racism."{{Cite book | last = CERD Task Force of the US Human Rights Network | title = Universal Periodic Review Joint Reports: United States of America | chapter = From Civil Rights to Human Rights: Implementing US Obligations Under the International Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) | date = August 2010 | page = 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry, P.

In the view of the [[U.S. Human Rights Network]], a network of scores of U.S. civil rights and human rights organizations, "[[Discrimination in the United States]] permeates all aspects of life and extends to all [[people of color|communities of color]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = U.S. Human Rights Network | title = Universal Periodic Review Joint Reports: United States of America | chapter = The United States of America: Summary Submission to the UN Universal Periodic Review | date = August 2010 | page = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the nature of the views held by average Americans have changed much over the past several decades, surveys by organizations such as ABC News have found that, even recently, large sections of Americans self-admit to holding discriminatory viewpoints; for example, a 2007 article by the organization stated that about one in ten admitted to holding prejudices against Hispanic and Latino Americans and about one in four did so regarding Arab-Americans.&lt;ref name=abc /&gt;

==== Atlantic slave trade ====
[[File:Slave Auction Ad.jpg|thumb|Right|Reproduction of a handbill advertising a slave auction in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], in 1769.]]
While the existence of slavery is arguably the root of subsequent conceptualizations of African-Americans, the origins of African enslavement have a large economic foundation. Among the European elite who structured national policy throughout the age of the Atlantic system of trade, there existed a popular ideology called [[mercantilism]], or the belief that policy pursuits were centralized around military power and economic wealth. Colonies were sources of mineral wealth and crops, to be used to the home country's advantage.&lt;ref name="Darity Jr."&gt;{{cite book|last=Darity Jr.|first=William|title=African Americans in the U.S. Economy (Africa, Europe, and the Origins of Uneven Development: The Role of Slavery)|year=2005|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|location=Lanham, Md.|pages=15–16|url=http://cas.umkc.edu/econ/economics/faculty/Forstater/688/Reading/Black%20Political%20Economy/AfricaEuropeOriginsUnevenDevelopment.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using Europeans for labor proved unsustainably expensive, as well as harmful to the supply of labor in the home countries. However, African slaves were "available in large numbers at prices that made [[Plantation economy|plantation agriculture]] in the Americas profitable".&lt;ref&gt;"Darity Jr., 2005"&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also argued that, along with the economic motives underlying slavery in the Americas, European world schemas played a large role in the enslavement of Africans. According to this view, the European in-group for humane behavior included the sub-continent, while African and American Indian cultures had a more localized definition of "an insider". While neither schema has inherent superiority, the technological advantage of Europeans became a resource to disseminate the conviction that underscored their schemas, that non-Europeans could be enslaved. With the capability to spread their schematic representation of the world, Europeans could impose a social contract, morally permitting three centuries of African slavery. While the disintegration of this social contract by the eighteenth century led to [[abolitionism]], it is argued that the removal of barriers to "insider status" is a very slow process, uncompleted even today (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eltis|first=David|title=Europeans and the Rise and Fall of African Slavery in the Americas: An Interpretation|journal=The American Historical Review|date=December 1993|volume=98|issue=5|pages=1402–1422|doi=10.2307/2167060|jstor=2167060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the above, the [[Atlantic slave trade]] prospered. According to estimates in the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database, between 1626 and 1860 more than 470,000 slaves were forcibly transported from Africa to what is now the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eltis|first=David|title=Extending the Frontiers: Essays on the New Transatlantic Slave Trade Database|year=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0-300-13436-0|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eltis |first=David |title=Estimates |url=http://www.slavevoyages.org/tast/assessment/estimates.faces |accessdate=October 19, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027021745/http://www.slavevoyages.org/tast/assessment/estimates.faces |archivedate=October 27, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], eight serving presidents owned slaves, a practice protected by the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calore|first1=Paul|title=The Causes of the Civil War: The Political, Cultural, Economic and Territorial Disputes between North and South|date=2008|publisher=McFarland|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Providing wealth for the white elite, approximately one [[Southern United States|Southern]] family in four held slaves prior to the Civil War.

==== Steps toward abolition of slavery ====
[[File:Whippedslaveedit.jpg|thumb|Scars of a whipped slave, April 2, 1863, [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] ]]
In the early part of the 19th century, a variety of organizations were established advocating the movement of black people from the United States to locations where they would enjoy greater freedom; some endorsed [[colony|colonization]], while others advocated emigration. During the 1820s and 1830s the [[American Colonization Society]] (A.C.S.) was the primary vehicle for proposals to return black Americans to greater freedom and equality in Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcnl.org/issues/item.php?item_id=731&amp;issue_id=75 |title=Background on conflict in Liberia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108042234/http://www.fcnl.org/issues/item.php?item_id=731&amp;issue_id=75 |archivedate=January 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1821 the A.C.S. established the colony of [[Liberia]], assisting thousands of former African-American slaves and free black people (with legislated limits) to move there from the United States. The colonization effort resulted from a mixture of motives with its founder [[Henry Clay]] stating, "unconquerable prejudice resulting from their color, they never could amalgamate with the free whites of this country. It was desirable, therefore, as it respected them, and the residue of the population of the country, to drain them off".&lt;ref name=ATH&gt;Maggie Montesinos Sale (1997).

Although in 1820 the Atlantic slave trade was equated with [[piracy]], punishable by death,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/SlaverBackground.htm |title=The legal and diplomatic background to the seizure of foreign vessels |publisher=Pdavis.nl |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; the practice of chattel slavery existed for the next half century. The [[Slavery in the United States#Domestic slave trade and forced migration|domestic slave trade]] was a major economic activity in the U.S. which lasted until the 1860s.&lt;ref name="CUP"&gt;Marcyliena H. Morgan (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=mhJcsiydNe8C&amp;pg=PA20 ''Language, Discourse and Power in African American Culture''], p. 20.

The historian Ira Berlin called this forced migration of slaves the "Second Middle Passage", because it reproduced many of the same horrors as the [[Middle Passage]] (the name given to the transportation of slaves from Africa to North America). These sales of slaves broke up many families, with Berlin writing that whether slaves were directly uprooted or lived in fear that they or their families would be involuntarily moved, "the massive deportation traumatized black people".&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 161–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals lost their connection to families and clans. Added to the earlier colonists combining slaves from different tribes, many ethnic Africans lost their knowledge of varying tribal origins in Africa. Most were descended from families who had been in the U.S. for many generations.&lt;ref name="CUP" /&gt;

All slaves in only the areas of the [[Confederate States of America]] that were not under direct control of the United States government were declared free by the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which was issued on January 1, 1863, by President [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=34 |title=Emancipation Proclamation (1863) |publisher=Ourdocuments.gov |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; While personally opposed to slavery, Lincoln believed that the Constitution did not give Congress the power to end slavery, stating in his first Inaugural Address that he "had no objection to [this] being made express and irrevocable" via the [[Corwin Amendment]].&lt;ref name="Walter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghostamendment.com/|title=Ghost Amendment: The Thirteenth Amendment That Never Was|last=Walter|first=Michael|year=2003|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On social and political rights for blacks, Lincoln stated, "I am not, nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people, I as much as any man am in favor of the superior position assigned to the white race."&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Lincoln, "Speeches and Writings 1832–1858: Speeches, Letters, and Miscellaneous Writings : the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, Volume 1". p. 638. Library of America, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The Emancipation Proclamation did not apply to areas loyal to, or controlled by, the Union. Slavery was not actually abolished in the U.S. until the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] which was declared ratified on December 6, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/amend1.htm#13 XIII – Slavery Abolished] The Avalon Project&lt;/ref&gt;

About four million [[African American|black]] [[slavery|slaves]] were freed in 1865. Ninety-five percent of blacks lived in the South, comprising one third of the population there as opposed to one percent of the population of the North. Consequently, fears of eventual emancipation were much greater in the South than in the North.&lt;ref&gt;James McPherson, Drawn with the Sword, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of males aged 13 to 43 died in the civil war, including 6% in the North and 18% in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/050155.html |title=The Deadliest War |publisher=Harvardmagazine.com |accessdate=2013-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225020/http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/050155.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Civil War, the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th amendment]] in 1865, formally abolishing slavery, was ratified. Furthermore, Congress passed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], which broadened a range of civil rights to all persons born in the United States. Despite this, the emergence of "[[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]]", sanctioned acts of subjugation against blacks, continued to bar African-Americans from due [[civil rights]]. The [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] limited U.S. citizenship to whites only, and in 1868 the effort toward civil rights was underscored with the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th amendment]] which granted citizenship to blacks.&lt;ref name="Schultz"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schultz|first=Jeffrey D.|title=Encyclopedia of Minorities in American Politics: African Americans and Asian Americans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDV40aK1T-sC&amp;pg=PA284&amp;dq=African+Americans+discriminated+by+Naturalization+Act+of+1790&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|page=284|year=2002|accessdate=2015-09-14|isbn=9781573561488}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]] followed, which was eliminated in a decision that undermined federal power to thwart private racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Estreicher|first=Samuel|title=Federal Power to Regulate Private Discrimination: The Revival of the Enforcement Clauses of the Reconstruction Era Amendments|journal=Columbia Law Review|year=1974|volume=74|issue=3|pages=452–454|jstor=112176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the last of the [[Reconstruction Era]] amendments, the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th amendment]] promised [[voting rights]] to African-American men (previously only white men of property could vote), and these cumulative federal efforts, African-Americans began taking advantage of enfranchisement. African-Americans began voting, seeking office positions, utilizing [[public education]]. Yet by the end of Reconstruction in the mid 1870s, violent [[white supremacist]]s came to power via [[paramilitary group]]s such as the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] and the [[White League]] and imposed [[Jim Crow]] laws that deprived African-Americans of voting rights and instituted systemic discriminatory policies through policies of unequal [[racial segregation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klarman|first=Michael|title=The Plessy Era|journal=The Supreme Court Review|year=1998|pages=307–308|jstor=3109701}}&lt;/ref&gt; Segregation, which began with slavery, continued with Jim Crow laws, with signs used to show blacks where they could legally walk, talk, drink, rest, or eat.&lt;ref name="Leon Litwack 2004"&gt;Leon Litwack, ''Jim Crow Blues'', Magazine of History (OAH Publications, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; For those places that were racially mixed, non-whites had to wait until all white customers were dealt with.&lt;ref name="Leon Litwack 2004"/&gt; Segregated facilities extended from white only schools to white only graveyards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38536668 "Barack Obama legacy: Did he improve US race relations?"].

==== Post-Reconstruction Era ====
[[File:TulsaRaceRiot-1921.png|thumb|right|During the 1921 [[Tulsa race riot]] thousands of whites rampaged through the black community, killing men and women, burning and looting stores and homes.

The new century saw a hardening of [[institutionalized racism]] and legal discrimination against citizens of African descent in the United States. Throughout this post Civil War period, [[racial stratification]] was informally and systemically enforced, in order to solidify the pre-existing social order. Although technically able to vote, [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], pervasive acts of terror such as [[lynching in the United States]] (often perpetrated by groups such as the reborn [[Ku Klux Klan]], founded in the Reconstruction South), and discriminatory laws such as [[grandfather clauses]] kept black Americans (and many [[Poor White]]s) disenfranchised particularly in the South. Furthermore, discrimination extended to state legislation that "allocated vastly unequal financial support" for black and white schools. In addition to this, county officials sometimes redistributed resources earmarked for blacks to white schools, further undermining educational opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beck|first=E.M.|author2=Tolnay, Stewart |title=Black Flight: Lethal Violence and the Great Migration, 1900–1930|journal=Social Science History|year=1990|volume=14|issue=3|page=354|doi=10.2307/1171355|jstor=1171355}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to de jure racism, protest and lobbyist groups emerged, most notably, the [[NAACP]] (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Anthony Appiah, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., eds. ''Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience'', in articles "Civil Rights Movement" by Patricia Sullivan (pp 441–455) and "National Association for the Advancement of Colored People" by Kate Tuttle (pp 1,388–1,391). {{ISBN|0-465-00071-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This time period is sometimes referred to as the [[nadir of American race relations]] because racism, [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], [[racial discrimination]], and expressions of [[white supremacy]] all increased. So did anti-black violence, including [[Mass racial violence in the United States|race riots]] such as the [[Atlanta Race riot]] of 1906 and the [[Tulsa race riot]] of 1921. The Atlanta riot was characterized by the French newspaper ''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]'' as a "racial massacre of negroes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6176609/f3.image "Un lynchage monstre"] (September 24, 1906) ''Le Petit Journal''&lt;/ref&gt; The Charleston ''[[The Post and Courier|News and Courier]]'' wrote in response to the Atlanta riots: "Separation of the races is the only radical solution of the negro problem in this country. There is nothing new about it. It was the Almighty who established the bounds of the habitation of the races. The negroes were brought here by compulsion; they should be induced to leave here by persuasion."&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D06EFD61F3EE733A25753C3A96F9C946797D6CF "DEPORTING THE NEGROES"] (September 30, 1906) ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, racism which had been viewed primarily as a problem in the Southern states, burst onto the national consciousness following the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], the relocation of millions of African Americans from their roots in the Southern states to the industrial centers of the North after [[World War I]], particularly in cities such as [[Boston]], Chicago, and New York City ([[Harlem]]). Within Chicago, for example, between 1910 and 1970, the percentage of African-Americans leapt from 2.0 percent to 32.7 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tolnay|first=Stewart|title=The African American 'Great Migration' and Beyond|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|year=2003|volume=29|page=221|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100009|jstor=30036966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demographic patterns of black migrants and external economic conditions are largely studied stimulants regarding the Great Migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tolnay|first=Stewart|title=The African American 'Great Migration' and Beyond|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|year=2003|volume=29|page=213|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100009|jstor=30036966}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, migrating blacks (between 1910 and 1920) were more likely to be literate than blacks that remained in the South. Known economic push factors played a role in migration, such as the emergence of a split labor market and agricultural distress from the [[boll weevil]] destruction of the cotton economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beck|first=E.M.|author2=Tolnay, Stewart |title=Black Flight: Lethal Violence and the Great Migration, 1900–1930|journal=Social Science History|year=1990|volume=14|issue=3|pages=351–352|doi=10.2307/1171355|jstor=1171355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:We want white tenants.jpg|thumb|left|White tenants seeking to prevent blacks from moving into the [[Public housing in Detroit|housing project]] erected this sign. Detroit, 1942.]]
Southern migrants were often treated in accordance with pre-existing racial stratification. The rapid influx of blacks into the North disturbed the racial balance within cities, exacerbating hostility between both black and white Northerners. Stereotypic schemas of Southern blacks were used to attribute issues in urban areas, such as crime and disease, to the presence of African-Americans. Overall, African-Americans in Northern cities experienced systemic discrimination in a plethora of aspects of life. Within employment, economic opportunities for blacks were routed to the lowest-status and restrictive in potential mobility. Within the housing market, stronger discriminatory measures were used in correlation to the influx, resulting in a mix of "targeted violence, [[restrictive covenants]], [[redlining]] and racial steering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tolnay|first=Stewart|title=The African American 'Great Migration' and Beyond|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|year=2003|volume=29|pages=218–221|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100009|jstor=30036966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this period, racial tensions exploded, most violently in Chicago, and [[lynching in the United States|lynchings]]—mob-directed hangings, usually racially motivated—increased dramatically in the 1920s. Urban riots—whites attacking blacks—became a northern problem.&lt;ref&gt;Michael O. Emerson, Christian Smith (2001). "Divided by Faith: Evangelical Religion and the Problem of Race in America". p. 42.

Black soldiers were often poorly trained and equipped, and were often put on the frontlines in [[suicide mission]]s. The U.S. military was still heavily segregated in World War II. The air force and the marines had no blacks enlisted in their ranks. There were blacks in the Navy Seabees.

The [[Jim Crow Laws]] were state and local laws enacted in the [[Southern United States|Southern]] and [[Border states (Civil War)|border states]] of the United States and enforced between 1876 and 1965. They mandated "[[separate but equal]]" status for black Americans. In reality, this led to treatment and accommodations that were almost always inferior to those provided to [[white American]]s. The most important laws required that public schools, public places and public transportation, like trains and buses, have separate facilities for whites and blacks. State-sponsored school segregation was declared unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1954 in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''. One of the first federal court cases to challenge segregation in schools was [[Mendez v. Westminster]] in 1946.

By the 1950s, the [[Civil Rights Movement]] was gaining momentum. Membership in the NAACP increased in states across the U.S. A 1955 lynching that sparked public outrage about injustice was that of [[Emmett Till]], a 14-year-old boy from Chicago. Spending the summer with relatives in [[Money, Mississippi]], Till was killed for allegedly having [[wolf-whistle]]d at a white woman. Till had been badly beaten, one of his eyes was gouged out, and he was shot in the head before being thrown into the [[Tallahatchie River]], his body weighed down with a {{convert|70|lbs|kg|adj=on}} [[cotton gin]] fan tied around his neck with barbed wire. David Jackson writes that [[Mamie Till]], Emmett's Mother, "brought him home to Chicago and insisted on an open casket. Tens of thousands filed past Till's remains, but it was the publication of the searing funeral image in ''Jet'', with a stoic Mamie gazing at her murdered child's ravaged body, that forced the world to reckon with the brutality of American racism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://100photos.time.com/photos/emmett-till-david-jackson|title=How The Horrific Photograph of Emmett Till Helped Energize The Civil Rights Movement|website=100 Photographs {{!}} The Most Influential Images of All Time|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; News photographs circulated around the country, and drew intense public reaction.

In response to heightening discrimination and violence, non-violent acts of protest began to occur. For example, in February 1960, in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], four young African-American college students entered a Woolworth store and sat down at the counter but were refused service. The men had learned about non-violent protest in college, and continued to sit peacefully as whites tormented them at the counter, pouring ketchup on their heads and burning them with cigarettes. After this, many sit-ins took place in order to non-violently protest against racism and inequality. Sit-ins continued throughout the South and spread to other areas. Eventually, after many sit-ins and other non-violent protests, including marches and boycotts, places began to agree to desegregate.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Berkin, Christopher Miller, Robert Cherny, James Gormly (2011).

The [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]] marked a turning point during the Civil Rights Era. On Sunday, September 15, 1963 with a stack of dynamite hidden on an outside staircase, Ku Klux Klansmen destroyed one side of the Birmingham church. The bomb exploded in proximity to twenty-six children who were preparing for choir practice in the basement assembly room.

With the bombing occurring only a couple of weeks after [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], it became an integral aspect of transformed perceptions of conditions for blacks in America. It influenced the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] (that banned discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and labor unions) and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] which overruled remaining Jim Crow laws. Nonetheless, neither had been implemented by the end of the 1960s as civil rights leaders continued to strive for political and social freedom.

Segregation continued even after the demise of the Jim Crow laws. Data on house prices and attitudes toward integration from suggest that in the mid-20th century, segregation was a product of collective actions taken by whites to exclude blacks from their neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="vigdor"&gt;''The Rise and Decline of the American Ghetto'' David M.

Although in the U.S. informal discrimination and segregation have always existed, redlining began with the [[National Housing Act of 1934]], which established the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA). The practice was fought first through passage of the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]] (which prevents redlining when the criteria for redlining are based on race, religion, gender, familial status, disability, or ethnic origin), and later through the [[Community Reinvestment Act]] of 1977, which requires banks to apply the same lending criteria in all communities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0813339529 ''Comeback Cities: A Blueprint for Urban Neighborhood Revival''] By Paul S.

"The goal was not to relax lending restrictions but rather to get banks to apply the same criteria in the inner-city as in the [[suburbs]]."&lt;/ref&gt; Although redlining is illegal some argue that it continues to exist in other forms.

Up until the 1940s, the full revenue potential of what was called "the Negro market" was largely ignored by white-owned manufacturers in the U.S. with advertising focused on whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116831396726171042|title=How Pepsi Opened Door to Diversity|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=January 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blacks were also denied commercial deals.

From 1981 to 1997, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] discriminated against tens of thousands of black American farmers, denying loans that were provided to white farmers in similar circumstances. The discrimination was the subject of the ''[[Pigford v.

During the 1980s and '90s a number of riots occurred that were related to longstanding racial tensions between police and minority communities. The [[1980 Miami riots]] were catalyzed by the killing of an African-American motorist by four white [[Miami-Dade Police]] officers. They were subsequently acquitted on charges of manslaughter and evidence tampering. Similarly, the six-day [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] erupted after the acquittal of four white [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers who had been filmed beating [[Rodney King]], an African-American motorist. [[Khalil Gibran Muhammad]], the Director of the Harlem-based [[Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture]] has identified more than 100 instances of mass racial violence in the United States since 1935 and has noted that almost every instance was precipitated by a police incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.propublica.org/article/yes-black-america-fears-the-police-heres-why |title=Yes, Black America Fears the Police.

In South Carolina, for instance,"Whites were far likelier to name [[Hillary Clinton|Clinton]] than Obama as being most qualified to be commander in chief, likeliest to unite the country and most apt to capture the White House in November.

Asian Americans, including those of [[East Asian]], [[Southeast Asian]], and [[South Asian]] descent, have experienced racism since the first major groups of Chinese immigrants arrived in America. First-generation immigrants, children of immigrants, and Asians adopted by non-Asian families have all been impacted.&lt;ref name="Eguchi, Shinsuke 2013" /&gt;

[[File:The only one barred out cph.3b48680.jpg|thumb|A political cartoon from 1882 ridiculing the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]], showing a Chinese man, surrounded by benefits of Chinese immigration, being barred entry to the "Golden Gate of Liberty", while other groups, including [[Communists]] and [[Crime|"hoodlums"]], are allowed to enter. The caption reads sarcastically, "We must draw the line ''somewhere'', you know."]]

In the 19th century, America was undergoing rapid industrialization, leading to labor shortages in the mining and rail industries. Chinese immigrant labor was often used to fill this gap, most notably with the construction of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], leading to large-scale Chinese immigration.&lt;ref name="Eguchi, Shinsuke 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eguchi | first1 = Shinsuke | year = 2013 | title = Revisiting Asiacentricity: Toward Thinking Dialectically about Asian American Identities and Negotiation | url = | journal = Howard Journal of Communications | volume = 24 | issue = 1| pages = 95–115 | doi=10.1080/10646175.2013.748556}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Chinese immigrants were despised because they took the jobs of whites for cheaper pay, and the phrase [[Yellow Peril]], which predicted the demise of Western Civilization as a result of Chinese immigrants, gained popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chin | first1 = Philip | year = 2013 | title = The Chinese Exclusion Act: Ten Year Exclusion Act Debates and Passage – Part 3". | url = | journal = Chinese American Forum | volume = 29 | issue = 1| pages = 24–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This discrimination apexed with the 1882 [[1882 Chinese Exclusion Act|Chinese Exclusion Act]], which banned Chinese immigration to the United States. This was the first time that a law was passed to exclude a major group from the nation that was based on ethnicity and class.&lt;ref name="Eguchi, Shinsuke 2013" /&gt;

Local discriminatory laws were also enacted to stifle Chinese business and job opportunities; for example, in the 1886 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case of [[Yick Wo v. Hopkins]], a San Francisco city ordinance requiring permits for laundries (which were mostly Chinese-owned) was struck down, as it was clear the law solely targeted Chinese Americans. When the law was in effect, the city issued permits to virtually all non-Chinese permit applicants, while only granting one permit out of two hundred applications from Chinese laundry owners. When the Chinese laundries continued to operate, the city tried to fine the owners. In 1913, California, home to many Chinese immigrants, enacted an [[California Alien Land Law of 1913|Alien Land Law]], which significantly restricted land ownership by Asian immigrants, and [[California Alien Land Law of 1920|extended it]] in 1920, ultimately banning virtually all land ownership by Asians.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sakamoto | first1 = Taylor | year = 2007 | title = The Triumph and Tragedies of Japanese Women in America: A View Across Four Generations | url = | journal = History Teacher | volume = 41 | issue = 1| pages = 97–122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, Japanese immigrants, which were unaffected by the Exclusion Act, began to enter the United States, filling labor shortages that were once filled by Chinese workers. This influx also led to discrimination and was stymied when President Theodore Roosevelt restricted Japanese immigration. Later, Japanese immigration was closed when Japan entered into the [[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907]] to stop issuing passports to Japanese workers intending to move to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eguchi | first1 = Shinsuke | year = 2013 | title = Revisiting Asia centricity: Toward Thinking Dialectically about Asian American Identities and Negotiation | url = | journal = Howard Journal of Communications | volume = 24 | issue = 1| pages = 95–115 | doi=10.1080/10646175.2013.748556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] was an ally of the United States, and the federal government praised the resistance of the Chinese against Japan in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], attempting to reduce anti-Chinese sentiment. In 1943, the [[Magnuson Act]] was passed by Congress, repealing the Chinese Exclusion Act and reopening Chinese immigration. However, at the time, the United States was actively fighting the [[Empire of Japan]], which was a member of the [[Axis powers]]. Anti-Japanese racism, which spiked after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], was tacitly encouraged by the government, which used slurs such as "[[Jap]]" in propaganda posters and even [[Internment of Japanese Americans|interned Japanese Americans]], citing possible security threats.

Prior to 1965, Indian immigration to the U.S. was small and isolated, with fewer than fifty thousand Indian immigrants in the country. The [[Bellingham riots]] in [[Bellingham, Washington]] on September 5, 1907 epitomized the low tolerance in the U.S. for Indians and [[Hindu]]s. While anti-Asian racism was embedded in U.S. politics and culture in the early 20th century, Indians were also racialized for their anticolonialism, with U.S. officials, casting them as a Hindu menace, pushing for Western imperial expansion abroad.&lt;ref name="Seema"&gt;{{cite book|author=Seema Sohi|title=Echoes of Mutiny: Race, Surveillance, and Indian Anticolonialism in North America|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-937625-4|page=8 |quote=Indians in North America, nearly 90 percent of whom where Sikhs from the state of Punjab, were also racialized through colonial gendered discourses.

The [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional [[Northern European]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic groups]], and as a result would significantly, and unintentionally, alter the demographic mix in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Immigration law"&gt;{{cite web |title= 1965 immigration law changed face of America |author=Jennifer Ludden |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5391395 |publisher=NPR |accessdate=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the U.S. immigration laws prior to 1965, sociologist Stephen Klineberg states the law "declared that Northern Europeans are a superior subspecies of the white race."&lt;ref name="Immigration law"/&gt; In 1990, Asian immigration was encouraged when nonimmigrant temporary working visas were given to help with the shortage of skilled labor within the United States.&lt;ref name="Eguchi, Shinsuke 2013" /&gt;

In 2000, out of 1,218 adult Asian Americans, 92 percent of those who experienced personal discrimination believed that the unfair treatment was due to their ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Lai, Lei 2013" /&gt;

Asian American stereotypes can also obstruct career paths; because Asians are seen as better skilled in engineering, computing, and mathematics, they are often encouraged to pursue technical careers. They are also discouraged from pursuing non-technical occupations or executive occupations requiring more social interaction, since Asians are expected to have poor social skills. In the 2000 study, forty percent of those surveyed who experienced discrimination believed that they had lost hiring or promotion opportunities. In 2007, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] reported that Asians make up 10 percent of professional jobs, while 3.7 percent of them held executive, senior level, or manager positions.&lt;ref name="Lai, Lei 2013" /&gt;

Other forms of discrimination include racial profiling and hate crimes.

Various [[European American]] immigrant groups have been subject to discrimination either on the basis of their immigrant status (known as "[[Nativism (politics)|Nativism]]") or on the basis of their ethnicities (country of origin).
[[File:Philadelphia1844riot.jpg|thumb|[[Philadelphia Nativist riots]].]]
[[File:NINA-nyt.JPG|thumb|''[[New York Times]]'', 1854 ad, reading "No Irish need apply."]]
In the 19th century, this was particularly true of [[Anti-Irish sentiment|anti-Irish prejudice]], which was partly [[anti-Catholic]] sentiment, partly anti-Irish as an ethnicity. This was especially true for Irish Catholics who immigrated to the U.S. in the mid-19th century; the large number of Irish (both Catholic and Protestant) who settled in America in the 18th century had largely (but not entirely) escaped such discrimination and eventually blended into the American white population. During the 1830s in the U.S., riots for control of job sites broke out in rural areas among rival labour teams from different parts of Ireland, and between Irish and local American work teams competing for construction jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Prince, Carl E. (1985) "The Great 'Riot Year': Jacksonian Democracy and Patterns of Violence in 1834." ''Journal of the Early Republic'' 5(1): 1–19. ISSN 0275-1275 examines 24 episodes including the January labor riot at the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Canal, the New York City election riot in April, the Philadelphia race riot in August, and the Baltimore &amp; Washington Railroad riot in November.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Native American Party, commonly called the [[Know Nothing]] movement was a political party, whose membership was limited to Protestant men, that operated on a national basis during the mid-1850s and sought to limit the influence of Irish Catholics and other immigrants, thus reflecting nativism and anti-Catholic sentiment. There was widespread anti-Irish job discrimination in the United States and "No Irish need apply" signs were common.&lt;ref&gt;Fried, Rebecca A.

{{further information|Nordic race#Nordicism in the United States}}
The 20th century saw discrimination against immigrants from southern and eastern Europe (notably Italian Americans and [[Polish Americans]]), partly from anti-Catholic sentiment (as well as discrimination against Irish-Americans), and partly from [[Nordicism]], which considered all non-[[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] immigrants as racially inferior.

An advocate of the U.S. immigration laws that favored Northern Europeans, the Klansman [[Lothrop Stoddard]] wrote primarily on the alleged dangers posed by "[[colored]]" peoples to white civilization, with his most famous book ''[[The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy]]'' in 1920. Nordicism led to the reduction in Southern European, along with [[Slavs|Slavic]] Eastern European and Russian immigrants in the [[National Origins Formula]] of the [[Emergency Quota Act]] of 1921 and the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], whose goal was to maintain the status quo distribution of ethnicity by limiting immigration of non-Northern Europeans. According to the U.S. Department of State the purpose of the act was "to preserve the ideal of American homogeneity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1921-1936/immigration-act | work=U.S Department of State Office of the Historian | title=The Immigration Act of 1924 (The Johnson-Reed Act) | accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The racial term ''[[Untermensch]]'' originates from the title of Stoddard's 1922 book ''The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under-man''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Stoddard, Lothrop| authorlink = Lothrop Stoddard| year = 1922| title = The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under Man| publisher = [[Charles Scribner's Sons]]| location = New York| isbn =| url = https://archive.org/details/revoltagainstciv00stoduoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later adopted by the Nazis (and its chief racial theorist [[Alfred Rosenberg]]) from that book's German version ''Der Kulturumsturz: Die Drohung des Untermenschen'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;

There was also discrimination against [[German Americans]] and Italian Americans due to Germany and Italy being enemy countries during [[World War I]] (Germany) and [[World War II]] (Germany and Italy). This resulted in a sharp decrease in German-American ethnic identity and a sharp decrease in the use of [[German in the United States]] following World War I, which had hitherto been significant, and to [[German American internment]] and [[Italian American internment]] during World War II; see also [[German American#World War I anti-German sentiment|World War I anti-German sentiment]].

Specific racism against other European-American ethnicities significantly diminished as a political issue in the 1930s, being replaced by a bi-racialism of black/white, as described and predicted by [[Lothrop Stoddard]], due to numerous causes. The National Origins Formula significantly reduced inflows of non-Nordic ethnicities; the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] (of African-Americans out of the South) displaced anti-white immigrant racism with anti-black racism.&lt;ref name="Migration"/&gt;

== Hispanic and Latino Americans ==
Americans of Latin American ancestry (often categorized as "[[Hispanic]]") come from a wide variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds. Latinos are not all distinguishable as a racial minority.

After the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846–1848), the U.S. annexed much of the current Southwestern region from Mexico. Mexicans residing in that territory found themselves subject to discrimination. It is estimated that at least 597 Mexicans were lynched between 1848 and 1928 (this is a conservative estimate due to lack of records in many reported lynchings). Mexicans were lynched at a rate of 27.4 per 100,000 of population between 1880 and 1930.

During [[The Great Depression]], the U.S. government sponsored a [[Mexican Repatriation]] program which was intended to encourage Mexican immigrants to voluntarily return to Mexico, however, many were forcibly removed against their will. In total, up to one million persons of Mexican ancestry were deported, approximately 60 percent of those individuals were actually U.S. citizens.

The [[Zoot Suit riots]] were vivid incidents of racial violence against Latinos (e.g., [[Mexican-Americans]]) in Los Angeles in 1943. Naval servicemen stationed in a Latino neighborhood conflicted with youth in the dense neighborhood. Frequent confrontations between small groups and individuals had intensified into several days of non-stop rioting. Large mobs of servicemen would enter civilian quarters looking to attack Mexican American youths, some of whom were wearing [[zoot suit]]s, a distinctive exaggerated fashion popular among that group.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Griswold del Castillo, "The Los Angeles "Zoot Suit Riots" Revisited: Mexican and Latin American Perspectives," ''Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos'', Vol. 16, No. 2. (Summer, 2000), pp. 367–391.&lt;/ref&gt; The disturbances continued unchecked, and even assisted, by the local police for several days before base commanders declared downtown Los Angeles and Mexican American neighborhoods off-limits to servicemen.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur C.

Many public institutions, businesses, and homeowners associations had official policies to exclude Mexican Americans. School children of Mexican American descent were subject to racial segregation in the public school system. In many counties, Mexican Americans were excluded from serving as jurors in court cases, especially in those that involved a Mexican American defendant. In many areas across the Southwest, they lived in separate residential areas, due to laws and real estate company policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/osi04.soc.ush.civil.mendez/ |title=Teachers' Domain: Mendez v.

During the 1960s, Mexican American youth formed the [[Chicano Movement|Chicano Civil Rights Movement]].

== Jewish Americans ==
{{Main article|Antisemitism in the United States}}
[[Antisemitism]] has also played a role in the United States. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, hundreds of thousands of ethnic [[Jews]] were escaping the [[pogrom]]s in Europe. They boarded boats from ports on the Baltic Sea and in Northern Germany, and largely arrived at [[Ellis Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name=Takaki-JewishMigr&gt;Ronald Takaki, ''A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America'' (New York: Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1993), 277–283.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is suggested by [[Leo Rosten]], in his book ''[[The Joys of Yiddish]]'', that as soon as they left the boat, they were subject to racism from the port immigration authorities. The derogatory term ''[[kike]]'' was adopted when referring to Jews (because they often could not write so they may have signed their immigration papers with circles – or kikel in [[Yiddish]]).&lt;ref&gt;Rosten, Leo (1968) ''The Joys of Yiddish''&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts were also made by the [[Asiatic Exclusion League]] to bar Jewish immigrants (along with other Middle Eastern ethnic groups, like Arabs, Assyrians, and Armenians) from naturalization, but they (along with Assyrians and Armenians) were nevertheless granted US citizenship, despite being classified as Asian.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/asiaticexclusion00asia "Proceedings of the Asiatic Exclusion League"] Asiatic Exclusion League. San Francisco: April 1910. Pg. 7. "To amend section twenty-one hundred and sixty-nine of the Revised Statutes of the United States. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that section twenty-one hundred and sixty-nine of the Revised Statutes of the United States be, and the same is hereby, amended by adding thereto the following: And Mongolians, Malays, and other Asiatics, except Armenians, Assyrians, and Jews, shall not be naturalized in the United States."&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1910s, the Southern Jewish communities were attacked by the Ku Klux Klan, who objected to Jewish immigration, and often used "The Jewish Banker" in their propaganda. In 1915, [[Leo Frank]] was lynched in Georgia after being convicted of rape and sentenced to death (his punishment was commuted to life imprisonment).&lt;ref name="lynching openly organized"&gt;Phagan, 1987, p. 27, states that "everyone knew the identity of the lynchers" (putting the words in her father's mouth). Oney, 2003, p. 526, quotes Carl Abernathy as saying, "They'd go to a man's office and talk to him or … see a man on the job and talk to him," and an unidentified lyncher as saying "The organization of the body was more open than mysterious."&lt;/ref&gt; This event was a catalyst in the re-formation of the new Ku Klux Klan.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Various Shady Lives of the Ku Klux Klan|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,898581,00.html|work=[[Time magazine]]|publisher=|quote=An itinerant Methodist preacher named William Joseph Simmons started up the Klan again in Atlanta.

The events in [[Nazi Germany]] also attracted attention from the United States. Jewish lobbying for intervention in Europe drew opposition from the [[isolationists]], amongst whom was Father [[Charles Coughlin]], a well known radio priest, who was known to be critical of Jews, believing that they were leading the United States into the war.&lt;ref name="Coughlin"&gt;[http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/53/coughlin.html Father Charles Edward Coughlin (1891–1971)] By Richard Sanders, editor, ''Press for Conversion!''&lt;/ref&gt; He preached in weekly, overtly anti-Semitic sermons and, from 1936, began publication of a newspaper, ''[[Social Justice (periodical)|Social Justice]]'', in which he printed anti-Semitic accusations such as ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Christine Athans, "A New Perspective on Father Charles E. Coughlin," ''Church History'', Vol. 56, No. 2. (June 1987), pp. 224–235, [[American Society of Church History]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Jewish organizations, Christian organizations, Muslim organizations, and academics consider the [[Nation of Islam]] to be anti-Semitic. Specifically, they claim that the Nation of Islam has engaged in revisionist and antisemitic interpretations of [[the Holocaust]] and exaggerates the [[Jewish views on slavery|role of Jews in the African slave trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~antis/papers/occasional.papers.html |title=H-ANTISEMITISM OCCASIONAL PAPERS, NO. 1M |publisher=H-net.msu.edu |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) alleged that the NOI's Health Minister, Dr. Abdul Alim Muhammad, accused Jewish doctors of injecting blacks with the AIDS virus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/focus_sheets/focus_islam.asp |title=The Nation of Islam |publisher=Anti-Defamation League |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426194442/http://www.adl.org/focus_sheets/focus_islam.asp |archivedate=April 26, 2006 |accessdate=July 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an allegation that Muhammad and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' have refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1993/09/27/a-dc-clinics-controversial-rx-for-aids/19d2c4a8-5d3a-48a3-8df3-061eb6a99d26/ |title=A D.C.

=== New antisemitism ===

{{Main article|New antisemitism}}
In recent years some scholars have advanced the concept of ''New antisemitism'', coming simultaneously from the Far Left, the far right, and [[Islamism|radical Islam]], which tends to focus on opposition to the creation of a Jewish homeland in the [[State of Israel]], and argue that the language of [[Anti-Zionism]] and [[criticism of Israel]] are used to attack Jews more broadly. In this view, the proponents of the new concept believe that criticisms of Israel and [[Zionism]] are often disproportionate in degree and unique in kind, and attribute this to antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;Sources for the following are:

[[Yehuda Bauer]], Professor of Holocaust Studies at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], has argued that the concept of a "new antisemitism" is essentially false since it is in fact an alternative form of the old antisemitism of previous decades, which he believes remains latent at times but recurs whenever it is triggered. In his view, the current trigger is the Israeli situation; if a compromise making ground in the [[Arab-Israeli peace process]] were achieved, he believes that antisemitism would decline but not disappear.

Noted critics of Israel, such as [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Norman Finkelstein]], question the extent of new antisemitism in the United States. Chomsky has written in his work ''[[Necessary Illusions]]'' that the Anti-Defamation League casts any question of pro-Israeli policy as antisemitism, conflating and muddling issues as even Zionists receive the allegation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.nvg.org/~skars/ni/ni-c10-s20.html Noam Chomsky, ''Necessary Illusions'', Appendix V, Segment 20]&lt;/ref&gt; Finkelstein has stated that supposed "new antisemitism" is a preposterous concept advanced by the ADL to combat critics of Israeli policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06/08/30/1418200 |title=Congressmember Weiner Gets It Wrong on Palestinian Group He Tried To Bar From U.S. |date=August 30, 2006 |publisher=[[Democracy Now!]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114051541/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06%2F08%2F30%2F1418200 |archivedate=November 14, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People of Middle Eastern and South Asian descent historically occupied an ambiguous racial status in the United States. Middle Eastern and South Asian immigrants were among those who sued in the late 19th and early 20th century to determine whether they were "white" immigrants as required by naturalization law. By 1923, courts had vindicated a "common-knowledge" standard, concluding that "scientific evidence", including the notion of a "[[Caucasian race]]" including Middle Easterners and many South Asians, was incoherent. Legal scholar John Tehranian argues that in reality this was a "performance-based" standard, relating to religious practices, education, intermarriage and a community's role in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;John Tehranian, "Performing Whiteness: Naturalization Litigation and the Construction of Racial Identity in America," ''[[The Yale Law Journal]]'', Vol. 109, No. 4.

"Whereas before September 11, Arab- and Muslim-Americans were not included in discourses on race and racism in the United States, a public discourse emerged after September 11 on whether Arabs and Muslims were being treated fairly or being subjected to racism with the rise in hate crimes and government measures targeting Arabs and Muslims" (p. 141). {{Cite book | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] | isbn = 978-0-415-37542-9 | editors = Zahia Smail Salhi, Ian Richard Netton (eds.) | last = Alsultany | first = Evelyn | title = The Arab diaspora: Voices of an anguished scream | chapter = From ambiguity to abjection: Iraqi-Americans negotiating race in the United States | year = 2006 | page = 127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"'Muslim' identity has certainly congealed as a marker of exclusion and marginalization, in relation to white or mainstream America, which is subjected to similar processes of racialization, and racism, that operate for racial minority groups."{{Cite book | publisher = [[Duke University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-8223-4409-4 | last = Maira | first = Sunaina | title = Missing: youth, citizenship, and empire after 9/11 | date = January 2009 | page = 229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Arab and non-Muslim Middle Eastern people, as well as [[South Asians]] of different ethnic/religious backgrounds (Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs) have been stereotyped as "Arabs".

The November 1979 [[Iranian hostage crisis]] of the U.S. embassy in [[Tehran]] precipitated a wave of anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States, directed both against the [[Iranian Revolution|new Islamic regime]] and Iranian nationals and immigrants. Even though such sentiments gradually declined after the release of the hostages at the start of 1981, they sometimes flare up. In response, some Iranian immigrants to the U.S. have distanced themselves from their nationality and instead identify primarily on the basis of their ethnic or religious affiliations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mehdi|last=Bozorgmehr|title=No solidarity: Iranians in the U.S|url=http://www.iranian.com/Opinion/2001/May/Iranians/index.html#3a|work=The Iranian|date=May 2, 2001|accessdate=2007-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native Americans, who have lived on the North American continent for at least 10,000 years,&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Charles C., ''1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus'', Vintage Books, 2006, c.2005, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; had an enormously complex impact on American history and racial relations. During the colonial and independent periods, a long series of conflicts were waged, often with the objective of obtaining resources of Native Americans. Through [[List of wars|wars]], [[population transfer|forced displacement]] (such as in the [[Trail of Tears]]), and the imposition of treaties, land was taken. The loss of land often resulted in hardships for Native Americans. In the early 18th century, the English had enslaved nearly 800 Choctaws.&lt;ref name=brescia_era&gt;{{cite book| last = Brescia | first = William (Bill) | title = Tribal Government, A New Era | publisher = Choctaw Heritage Press | location = Philadelphia, Mississippi | chapter = Chapter 2, French-Choctaw Contact, 1680s–1763 | page = 8 | isbn = | year = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the creation of the United States, the idea of [[Indian removal]] gained momentum. However, some Native Americans chose or were allowed to remain and avoided removal whereafter they were subjected to official racism. The Choctaws in [[Mississippi]] described their situation in 1849, "we have had our habitations torn down and burned, our fences destroyed, cattle turned into our fields and we ourselves have been scourged, manacled, fettered and otherwise personally abused, until by such treatment some of our best men have died."&lt;ref name=peterson&gt;{{cite book| last = Walter | first = Williams | title = Southeastern Indians: Since the Removal Era | publisher = University of Georgia Press | location = Athens, Georgia | chapter = Three Efforts at Development among the Choctaws of Mississippi | year = 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph B.

In the 1800s, conflicts were spurred by ideologies such as [[Manifest destiny]], which held that the United States was destined to expand from coast to coast on the North American continent. In the years leading up to the [[Indian Removal Act |Indian Removal Act of 1830]] there were many armed conflicts between settlers and Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Worlds Together, Worlds Apart, Robert Tignor, Jeremy Adelman, Stephen Aron, Stephen Kotkin, Suzanne Marchand, Gyan Prakash, Michael Tsin, W.W.

An egregious attempt occurred with the [[California gold rush]], the first two years of which saw the deaths of thousands of Native Americans. Under [[Alta California|Mexican rule in California]], Indians were subjected to ''de facto'' enslavement under a system of [[peon]]age by the white elite.

A [[Ghost Dance]] ritual on the Northern Lakota reservation at Wounded Knee, [[South Dakota]], led to the U.S. Army's attempt to subdue the Lakota. The dance was part of a religion founded by [[Wovoka]] that told of the return of the Messiah to relieve the suffering of Native Americans and promised that if they would live righteous lives and perform the Ghost Dance properly, the European American invaders would vanish, the bison would return, and the living and the dead would be reunited in an Edenic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plains Humanities: Wounded Knee Massacre|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.war.056|accessdate=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 29, 1890 at Wounded Knee, gunfire erupted, and U.S. soldiers killed up to 300 Indians, mostly old men, women and children.&lt;ref name="Wounded Knee"&gt;{{cite web|title=Plains Humanities: Wounded Knee Massacre|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.war.056|accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period surrounding the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre, author [[L. Frank Baum]] wrote two editorials about Native Americans. Five days after the killing of the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] [[Sioux]] [[Medicine man|holy man]], [[Sitting Bull]], Baum wrote, "The proud spirit of the original owners of these vast prairies inherited through centuries of fierce and bloody wars for their possession, lingered last in the bosom of Sitting Bull. With his fall the nobility of the [[Redskin (slang)|Redskin]] is extinguished, and what few are left are a pack of whining curs who lick the hand that smites them. The Whites, by the law of conquest, by a justice of civilization, are masters of the American continent, and the best safety of the frontier settlements will be secured by the total annihilation of the few remaining Indians. Why not annihilation? Their glory has fled, their spirit broken, their manhood effaced; better that they die than live the miserable wretches that they are."&lt;ref name="editorials"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northern.edu/hastingw/baumedts.htm |title="L.

Waller Hastings&lt;/ref&gt; Following the December 29, 1890, massacre, Baum wrote, "The ''Pioneer'' has before declared that our only safety depends upon the total extermination [sic] of the Indians. Having wronged them for centuries we had better, in order to protect our civilization, follow it up by one more wrong and wipe these untamed and untamable creatures from the face of the earth. In this lies safety for our settlers and the soldiers who are under incompetent commands. Otherwise, we may expect future years to be as full of trouble with the redskins as those have been in the past."&lt;ref name="editorials" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Professor Robert Venables, Senior Lecturer Rural Sociology Department, Cornell University, "Looking Back at Wounded Knee 1890", ''Northeast Indian Quarterly'', Spring 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Military and civil resistance by Native Americans has been a constant feature of American history. So too have a variety of debates around issues of sovereignty, the upholding of treaty provisions, and the civil rights of Native Americans under U.S. law.

=== Reservation marginalization ===
{{See also|Native American reservations}}
Once their territories were incorporated into the United States, surviving Native Americans were denied equality before the law and often treated as wards of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Many Native Americans were moved to reservations—constituting 4% of U.S. territory. In a number of cases, treaties signed with Native Americans were violated. Tens of thousands of American Indians and Alaska Natives were forced to attend a [[Indian boarding school|residential school system]] which sought to reeducate them in white settler American values, culture and economy.&lt;ref&gt;Ward Churchill, ''Kill the Indian, Save the Man'', 2006. The basis for this theory was that inside every native person, there was a repressed white person screaming to come to the surface. Abuse both physical and psychological was common in these schools, and often their objective of 'compulsory whiteness' was not even ultimately achieved, with many of the Indians who later returned to the reservations afterwards not at all 'becoming white', but instead simply becoming heavy alcoholics and displaying signs of permanent psychological distress, and even [[mental illness]]. Further, these individuals were often either totally unemployable or only marginally employed, as it was sensed by those around them that on the one hand, they had not successfully assimilated into 'white society', nor were they any longer acceptable to the Indian societies from which they had originated.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/world_news_america/9097996.stm | work=BBC News | first1=Franz | last1=Strasser | first2=Sharon | last2=Carpenter | title=Native Americans battle teenage suicide | date=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further dispossession of various kinds continues into the present, although these current dispossessions, especially in terms of land, rarely make major news headlines in the country (e.g., the [[Lenape]] people's recent fiscal troubles and subsequent land grab by the [[State of New Jersey]]), and sometimes even fail to make it to headlines in the localities in which they occur. Through concessions for industries such as oil, mining and timber and through division of land from the [[Allotment Act]] forward, these concessions have raised problems of consent, exploitation of low royalty rates, environmental injustice, and gross mismanagement of funds held in trust, resulting in the loss of $10–40&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;United States Senate, [http://www.indiantrust.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=OtherMedia.ViewDetail&amp;Other_id=12&amp;Month=3&amp;Year=2007 Oversight Hearing on Trust Fund Litigation, Cobell v.

Using [[Psychometrics of racism|The Schedule of Racist Events]] (SRE), an 18-item self-report inventory that assesses the frequency of racist discrimination, Hope Landrine and Elizabeth A. Klonoff found that racist discrimination is rampant in the lives of African Americans and is strongly related to psychiatric symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;''The Schedule of Racist Events: A Measure of Racial Discrimination and a Study of Its Negative Physical and Mental Health Consequences'' Journal of Black Psychology, Vol. 22, No. 2, 144–168 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; A study on racist events in the lives of African American women found that lifetime experiences of racism were positively related to lifetime history of both physical disease and frequency of recent common colds. These relationships were largely unaccounted for by other variables. Demographic variables such as income and education were not related to experiences of racism. The results suggest that racism can be detrimental to African American's well being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kwate NO, Valdimarsdottir HB, Guevarra JS, Bovbjerg DH |title=Experiences of racist events are associated with negative health consequences for African American women |journal=J Natl Med Assoc |volume=95 |issue=6 |pages=450–60 |date=June 2003 |pmid=12856911 |doi= |url= |pmc=2594553}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physiological stress caused by racism has been documented in studies by [[Claude Steele]], Joshua Aronson, and Steven Spencer on what they term "[[stereotype threat]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blascovich J, Spencer SJ, Quinn D, Steele C |title=African Americans and high blood pressure: the role of stereotype threat |journal=Psychol Sci |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=225–9 |date=May 2001 |pmid=11437305 |doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00340 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quite similarly, another example of the psychosocial consequences of discrimination have been observed in a study sampling Mexican-origin participants in Fresno, California. It was found that perceived discrimination is correlated with depressive symptoms, especially for those less acculturated in the United States, like Mexican immigrants and migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finch|first=Brian|title=Perceived Discrimination and Depression among Mexican-Origin Adults in California|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|year=2000|volume=41|issue=3|page=309|doi=10.2307/2676322|jstor=2676322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the vein of somatic responses to discrimination, Kennedy et al. found that both measures of collective disrespect were strongly correlated with black mortality (r = 0.53 to 0.56), as well as with white mortality (r = 0.48 to 0.54). These data suggest that racism, measured as an ecologic characteristic, is associated with higher mortality in both blacks and whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kennedy BP, Kawachi I, Lochner K, Jones C, Prothrow-Stith D |title=(Dis)respect and black mortality |journal=Ethn Dis |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=207–14 |year=1997 |pmid=9467703 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers also suggest that racial segregation may lead to disparities in health and mortality. Thomas LaVeist (1989; 1993) tested the hypothesis that [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] would aid in explaining race differences in infant mortality rates across cities. Analyzing 176 large and midsized cities, LaVeist found support for the hypothesis. Since LaVeist's studies, segregation has received increased attention as a determinant of racial disparities in mortality.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Studies have shown that mortality rates for male and female African Americans are lower in areas with lower levels of residential segregation. Mortality for male and female whites was not associated in either direction with residential segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hart KD, Kunitz SJ, Sell RR, Mukamel DB |title=Metropolitan governance, residential segregation, and mortality among African Americans |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=434–8 |date=March 1998 |pmid=9518976 |pmc=1508338 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.88.3.434|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9518976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers Sharon A. Jackson, Roger T. Anderson, Norman J. Johnson and Paul D. Sorlie found that, after adjustment for family income, [[Mortality rate|mortality]] risk increased with increasing minority residential segregation among Blacks aged 25 to 44 years and non-Blacks aged 45 to 64 years. In most age/race/gender groups, the highest and lowest mortality risks occurred in the highest and lowest categories of residential segregation, respectively. These results suggest that minority residential segregation may influence mortality risk and underscore the traditional emphasis on the social underpinnings of disease and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jackson SA, Anderson RT, Johnson NJ, Sorlie PD |title=The relation of residential segregation to all-cause mortality: a study in black and white |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=615–7 |date=April 2000 |pmid=10754978 |pmc=1446199 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.90.4.615|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10754978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of heart disease among African Americans are associated with the segregation patterns in the neighborhoods where they live (Fang ''et al.'' 1998).

As early as 1866, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866|Civil Rights Act]] provided a remedy for intentional race discrimination in employment by private employers and state and local public employers. The [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]] applies to public employment or employment involving state action prohibiting deprivation of rights secured by the federal constitution or federal laws through action under color of law. Title VII is the principal federal statute with regard to employment discrimination prohibiting unlawful employment discrimination by public and private employers, labor organizations, training programs and employment agencies based on race or color, religion, gender, and national origin. Title VII also prohibits retaliation against any person for opposing any practice forbidden by statute, or for making a charge, testifying, assisting, or participating in a proceeding under the statute. The [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]] expanded the damages available in Title VII cases and granted Title VII plaintiffs the right to a jury trial. Title VII also provides that race and color discrimination against every race and color is prohibited.

Popular culture (songs, theater) for European American audiences in the 19th century created and perpetuated negative stereotypes of African Americans. One key symbol of racism against African Americans was the use of [[blackface]]. Directly related to this was the institution of [[Blackface|minstrelsy]]. Other stereotypes of African Americans included the fat, dark-skinned "[[mammy archetype|mammy]]" and the irrational, hypersexual male "buck".

In recent years increasing numbers of African-American activists have asserted that [[rap music]] videos commonly utilize scantily clothed African-American performers posing as thugs or pimps. The [[NAACP]] and the [[National Congress of Black Women]] also have called for the reform of images on videos and on television. [[Julian Bond]] said that in a segregated society, people get their impressions of other groups from what they see in videos and what they hear in music.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;Felicia R.

In a similar vein, activists protested against the BET show, ''Hot Ghetto Mess,'' which satirizes the culture of working-class African-Americans. The protests resulted in the change of the television show name to ''[[We Got to Do Better]].''&lt;ref name="nytimes1" /&gt;

It is understood that representations of minorities in the media have the ability to reinforce or change stereotypes. For example, in one study, a collection of white subjects were primed by a comedy skit either showing a stereotypical or neutral portrayal of African-American characters. Participants were then required to read a vignette describing an incident of sexual violence, with the alleged offender either white or black, and assign a rating for perceived guilt. For those shown the stereotypical African-American character, there was a significantly higher guilt rating for black alleged offender in the subsequent vignette, in comparison to the other conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ford|first=Thomas|title=Effects of Stereotypical Television Portrayals of African-Americans on Person Perception|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|year=1997|volume=60|issue=3|page=266|doi=10.2307/2787086|jstor=2787086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While schemas have an overt societal consequence, the strong development of them have lasting effect on recipients. Overall, it is found that strong in-group attitudes are correlated with academic and economic success. In a study analyzing the interaction of assimilation and racial-ethnic schemas for Hispanic youth found that strong schematic identities for Hispanic youth undermined academic achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Altschul|first=Inna |author2=Daphna Oyserman |author3=Deborah Bybee|title=Racial-Ethnic Self-Schemas and Segmented Assimilation: Identity and the Academic Achievement of Hispanic Youth|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|date=September 2008|volume=71|issue=3|page=303|doi=10.1177/019027250807100309|jstor=20141842}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional stereotypes attributed to minorities continue to influence societal interactions. For example, a 1993 Harvard Law Review article states that Asian-Americans are commonly viewed as submissive, as a combination of relative physical stature and Western comparisons of cultural attitudes. Furthermore, Asian-Americans are depicted as the model minority, unfair competitors, foreigners, and indistinguishable. These stereotypes can serve to dehumanize Asian-Americans and catalyze hostility and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Racial Violence against Asian Americans|journal=Harvard Law Review|year=1993|volume=106|issue=8|jstor=1341790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Formal discrimination ====
Formal discrimination against minorities has been present throughout American history. Leland T. Saito, Associate Professor of Sociology and American Studies &amp; Ethnicity at the [[University of Southern California]], writes, "Political rights have been circumscribed by race, class and gender since the founding of the United States, when the right to vote was restricted to white men of property. Throughout the history of the United States race has been used by whites – a category that has also shifted through time – for legitimizing and creating difference and social, economic and political exclusion."&lt;ref&gt;Leland T. Saito (1998). "Race and Politics: Asian Americans, Latinos, and Whites in a Los Angeles Suburb". p. 154. University of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Within education, a survey of black students in sixteen majority white universities found that four of five African-Americans reported some form of racial discrimination. For example, in February 1988, the University of Michigan enforced a new anti discrimination code following the distribution of fliers saying blacks "don't belong in classrooms, they belong hanging from trees". Other forms of reported discrimination were refusal to sit next to black in lecture, ignored input in class settings, and informal segregation. While the penalties are imposed, the psychological consequences of formal discrimination can still manifest. Black students, for example, reported feelings of heightened isolation and suspicion. Furthermore, studies have shown that academic performance is stunted for black students with these feelings as a result of their campus race interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilkerson|first=Isabel|title=Campus Blacks Feel Racism's Nuances|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/17/us/campus-blacks-feel-racism-s-nuances.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=November 5, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 17, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Minority-minority racism ====
{{Main article|Interminority racism in the United States}}
Minority racism is sometimes considered controversial because of theories of [[power (sociology)|power]] in society. Some theories of racism insist that racism can only exist in the context of social power to impose it upon others.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Catherine A. Hansman, Leon Spencer, Dale Grant, Mary Jackson, "Beyond Diversity: Dismantling Barriers in Education," ''Journal of Instructional Psychology'', March 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Yet discrimination and racism between racially [[marginalized]] groups has been noted. For example, there has been ongoing violence between African American and [[Mexican American]] gangs, particularly in [[Southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Blankstein And Joel Rubin.

This amounts to a standing authorization for Latino gang members to prove their mettle by terrorizing or even murdering any blacks sighted in a neighborhood claimed by a gang loyal to the Mexican Mafia.{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackamericaweb.com/site.aspx/bawnews/stateof/hutchinson105] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011215616/http://www.blackamericaweb.com/site.aspx/bawnews/stateof/hutchinson105 |date=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several significant riots in [[California prisons]] where Mexican American inmates and African Americans have targeted each other particularly, based on racial reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/12/race-riot-put-down-at-california-state.php JURIST – Paper Chase: Race riot put down at California state prison] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307234325/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/12/race-riot-put-down-at-california-state.php |date=March 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsmine.org/archive/security/incarceration/racial-segregation-continues-in-california-prisons.txt Racial segregation continues in California prisons] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823060942/http://newsmine.org/archive/security/incarceration/racial-segregation-continues-in-california-prisons.txt |date=August 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been noted conflict between recent immigrant groups and their established ethnic counterparts within the United States. Rapid growth in [[Africans in the United States|African]] and [[Caribbean]] immigrants has come into conflict with American blacks. Interaction and cooperation between black immigrants and American blacks are, ironically, debatable. One can argue that racial discrimination and cooperation is not ordinarily based on color of skin but more on shared common, cultural experiences, and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06044/654613.stm |title=African immigrants face bias from blacks |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=December 31, 1969 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/Story?id=5237459&amp;page=1 |title=Racism not always black and white |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=June 25, 2008 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, conflict between [[Chinese people|Chinese immigrants]] and [[Japanese Americans]] are known to have occurred in the [[San Gabriel Valley]] of the Los Angeles area in the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==== Interpersonal discrimination ====
In a manner that defines interpersonal discrimination in the United States, Darryl Brown of the Virginia Law Review states that while "our society has established a consensus against blatant, intentional racism and in decades since Brown v Board of Education has developed a sizeable set of legal remedies to address it", our legal system "ignores the possibility that 'race' is structural or interstitial, that it can be the root of injury even when not traceable to a specific intention or action"&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Darryl|title=Racism and Race Relations in the University|journal=Virginia Law Review|date=March 1990|volume=76|issue=2|jstor=1073204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpersonal discrimination is defined by its subtlety. Unlike formal discrimination, interpersonal discrimination is often not an overt or deliberate act of racism. For example, in an incident regarding a racial remark from a professor at Virginia Law, a rift was created by conflicting definitions of racism. For the students that defended the professor's innocence, "racism was defined as an act of intentional maliciousness". Yet for African Americans, racism was broadened to a detrimental influence on "the substantive dynamics of the classroom". As an effect, it is argued that the "daily repetition of subtle racism and subordination in the classroom and on campus can ultimately be, for African Americans, more productive of stress, anxiety and alienation than even blatant racists acts". Moreover, the attention to these acts of discrimination diverts energy from academics, becoming a distraction that white students do not generally face.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt;

=== Institutional ===
[[Institutional racism]] is the theory that aspects of the structure, pervasive attitudes, and established institutions of society disadvantage some racial groups, although not by an overtly discriminatory mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eraseracismny.org/html/whatis/whatis.php What is Institutional and Structural Racism?] ERASE RACISM&lt;/ref&gt; There are several factors that play into institutional racism, including but not limited to: accumulated wealth/benefits from racial groups that have benefited from past discrimination, educational and occupational disadvantages faced by non-native English speakers in the United States, ingrained stereotypical images that still remain in the society (e.g. black men are likely to be criminals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bullock | first1 = III | last2 = Rodgers | first2 = Jr. | year = 1976 | title = Institutional Racism: Prerequisites, Freezing, and Mapping | url = | journal = Phylon | volume = 37 | issue = 3| pages = 212–223 | doi=10.2307/274450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article, Peter Kaufman describes three instances in which institutional racism has contributed to current views of race.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Everyday Sociology Blog: Michael Brown, Ferguson, Missouri, and the Invisibility of Race|url = http://www.everydaysociologyblog.com/2014/08/michael-brown-ferguson-missouri-and-the-invisibility-of-race.html|website = www.everydaysociologyblog.com|accessdate = 2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are:
# The mis- and Missing Education of Race, in which he describes problems the educational system has in discussing "slavery, race, racism, and topics such as white privilege". He goes on to say that schools are still segregated based on class and race, which also contributes to race relations&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Residential Racial Segregation. According to Kaufman, the reason that schools are still segregated is due to towns and cities being largely segregated still.
# Media Monsters. This describes the role in which the media has in the portrayal of race. Mass media tends to play on "depictions of racialized stereotypes in the mass media [which are] ubiquitous, and such caricaturized images shape our perceptions of various racial groups". An example of this is the stereotyping of Blacks as criminals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; * {{cite book |first=Wilson |last=Head |title=A Life on the Edge: Experiences in Black and White in North America |publisher=University of Toronto Press |date=1995 |isbn=0-9680066-0-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Immigration ====
{{See also|Immigration to the United States}}

Access to United States [[citizenship]] was restricted by race, beginning with the [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] which excluded "non-whites" from citizenship.&lt;ref name="Schultz"/&gt;
Institutionalized prejudice existed against white followers of [[Roman Catholicism]] who immigrated from countries such as Ireland, Germany, Italy and France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhc.rtp.nc.us/tserve/nineteen/nkeyinfo/nromcath.htm Roman Catholics and Immigration in Nineteenth-Century America] by Julie Byrne, Dept. of Religion, Duke University, National Humanities Center&lt;/ref&gt; Other efforts include the 1882 [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] and the 1924 [[National Origins Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=47 |title=Chinese Exclusion Act (1882) |publisher=Ourdocuments.gov |date=July 1, 1968 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicaldocuments.com/ImmigrationActof1924.htm Immigration Act of 1924] HistoricalDocuments.com&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Immigration Act of 1924]] was aimed at further restricting the Southern and Eastern Europeans who had begun to enter the country in large numbers beginning in the 1890s. By limiting immigration of non-Northern Europeans, according to the U.S. Department of State Office of the Historian the purpose of the 1924 act was "to preserve the ideal of American homogeneity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1921-1936/immigration-act | work=U.S Department of State Office of the Historian | title=The Immigration Act of 1924 (The Johnson-Reed Act) | accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German praise for America's institutional racism, previously found in Hitler's ''Mein Kampf'', was continuous throughout the early 1930s, and Nazi lawyers were advocates of the use of American models.&lt;ref name="Whitman"/&gt; U.S. citizenship laws and [[Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States|anti-miscegenation laws]] directly inspired the two principal [[Nuremberg Laws]]—the Citizenship Law and the Blood Law.&lt;ref name="Whitman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitman|first1=James Q.|title=Hitler's American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law|date=2017|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=37–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction with immigration reform in the late 1980s (seen with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986), there have been noted IRCA-related discriminatory behavior toward Hispanics within employment. As the measure made it unlawful to hire without authorization to work in the United States, avoidant treatment toward "foreign-appearing workers" increased to bypass the required record-keeping or risk of sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lowell|first=Lindsay|title=Unintended Consequences of Immigration Reform: Discrimination and HIspanic Employment|journal=Demography|date=November 1995|volume=32|issue=4|page=617|doi=10.2307/2061678|jstor=2061678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wealth ====
{{See also|Wealth inequality in the United States}}
Massive racial differentials in account of wealth remain in the United States: between whites and African Americans, the gap is a factor of twenty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2011/0726/Wealth-gap-widens-Whites-net-worth-is-20-times-that-of-blacks |title=Wealth gap widens: Whites' net worth is 20 times that of blacks |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=July 26, 2011 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analyst of the phenomenon, Thomas Shapiro, professor of law and social policy at Brandeis University argues, "The wealth gap is not just a story of merit and achievement, it's also a story of the historical legacy of race in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15704759/ Census report: Broad racial disparities persist]", November 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Differentials applied to the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security Act]] (which excluded agricultural workers, a sector that then included most black workers), rewards to military officers, and the educational benefits offered returning soldiers after [[World War II]]. Pre-existing disparities in wealth are exacerbated by tax policies that reward investment over waged income, subsidize mortgages, and subsidize private sector developers.&lt;ref&gt;George Lipsitz, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2713291 The Possessive Investment in Whiteness: Racialized Social Democracy and the "White" Problem in American Studies]," ''American Quarterly'', Vol. 47, No. 3.

==== Health care ====
{{main|Race and health in the United States}}
There are major [[Race and health|racial differences in access to health care]] and in the quality of health care provided. A study published in the American Journal of Public Health estimated that: "over 886,000 deaths could have been prevented from 1991 to 2000 if African Americans had received the same care as whites". The key differences they cited were lack of insurance, inadequate [[health insurance|insurance]], poor service, and reluctance to seek care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Woolf SH, Johnson RE, Fryer GE, Rust G, Satcher D |title=The health impact of resolving racial disparities: an analysis of US mortality data |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=94 |issue=12 |pages=2078–81 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15569956 |pmc=1448594 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.94.12.2078|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15569956}}&lt;/ref&gt; A history of government-sponsored experimentation, such as the notorious [[Tuskegee Syphilis Study]] has left a legacy of African American distrust of the medical system.&lt;ref&gt;"The History of Black 'Paranoia{{'"}}, ch. 3 of Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair, ''Whiteout: The CIA, Drugs, and the Press'', London: Verso, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inequalities in health care may also reflect a [[systemic bias]] in the way medical procedures and treatments are prescribed for different ethnic groups. A [[University of Edinburgh]] Professor of Public Health, Raj Bhopal, writes that the history of [[Scientific racism|racism in science]] and medicine shows that people and institutions behave according to the ethos of their times and warns of dangers to avoid in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bhopal R |title=Spectre of racism in health and health care: lessons from history and the United States |journal=BMJ |volume=316 |issue=7149 |pages=1970–3 |date=June 1998 |pmid=9641943 |pmc=1113412 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.316.7149.1970|url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9641943}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Harvard]] Professor of Social Epidemiology contended that much modern research supported the assumptions needed to justify racism.

==== Politics ====
It is argued that [[Dog-whistle politics|racial coding]] of concepts like crime and welfare has been used to strategically influence public political views. Racial coding is implicit; it incorporates racially primed language or imagery to allude to racial attitudes and thinking. For example, in the context of domestic policy, it is argued that Ronald Reagan implied linkages between concepts like "special interests" and "big government" with ill-perceived minority groups in the 1980s, using the conditioned negativity toward the minority groups to discredit certain policies and programs during campaigns. In a study analyzing how political ads prime attitudes, Valentino compares the voting responses of participants after being exposed to narration of a George W. Bush advertisement paired with three different types of visuals with different embedded racial cues to create three conditions: neutral, race comparison, and undeserving blacks. For example, as the narrator states "Democrats want to spend your tax dollars on wasteful government programs", the video shows an image of a black woman and child in an office setting. Valentino found that the undeserving blacks condition produced the largest primed effect in racialized policies, like opposition to affirmative action and welfare spending.&lt;ref name=Valentino&gt;{{cite journal|last=Valentino|first=Nicholas|title=Cues that Matter: How Political Ads Prime Racial Attitudes during Campaigns|journal=The American Political Science Review|date=March 2002|volume=96|issue=1|page=83|doi=10.1017/s0003055402004240|jstor=3117811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ian Haney-López]], Professor of Law at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], refers to this phenomenon as [[dog-whistle politics]], which has pushed, he argues, middle class white Americans to vote against their economic self-interest in order to punish "undeserving minorities" who, they believe, are receiving too much public assistance at their expense. According to López, conservative middle-class whites, convinced that minorities are the enemy by powerful economic interests, supported politicians who promised to curb illegal immigration and crack down on crime, but inadvertently they also voted for policies that favor the extremely rich, such as slashing taxes for top income brackets, giving corporations more regulatory control over industry and financial markets, [[Union busting|busting unions]], cutting pensions for future public employees, reducing funding for public schools, and retrenching the social welfare state. He argues that these same voters cannot link rising inequality which has impacted their lives to the policy agendas they support, which resulted in a massive transfer of wealth to the top 1% of the population since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://billmoyers.com/episode/ian-haney-lopez-on-the-dog-whistle-politics-of-race/ Full Show: Ian Haney López on the Dog Whistle Politics of Race, Part I].

==== Justice system ====
{{Main article|Race and crime in the United States}}
Racial disparities have been noted in all levels of the U.S. justice system. According to 2009 congressional testimony from Marc Mauer; while African Americans comprise 13% of the US population and 14% of monthly drug users they are 37% of the people arrested for drug offenses; as well as 56% of the people in state prisons for drug offenses. The U.S. Sentencing Commission reported in March 2010 that in the federal system black offenders receive sentences that are 10% longer than white offenders for the same crimes. A July 2009 report by the Sentencing Project found that two-thirds of the people in the U.S. with life sentences are non-white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=|title=Fourteen Examples of Racism in Criminal Justice System|author=Bill Quigley|date=July 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hate crimes ===
{{Main article|Hate crime}}
In the United States, most crimes that target victims on the basis of their race or ethnicity are considered [[hate crimes]]. (For federal law purposes, crimes targeting Hispanics because of their identity are considered hate crimes based on ethnicity.) Leading forms of bias cited in the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, based on law enforcement agency filings are: anti-black, anti-Jewish, anti-white, anti-homosexual, and anti-Hispanic bias in that order in both 2004 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2004/openpage.htm Hate Crime Statistics, 2004]. [https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2005/index.html Hate Crime Statistics, 2005].&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, whites, blacks, and Hispanics had similar rates of violent hate crime victimization between 2007 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hate Crime Victimization, 2003–2011 |url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/hcv0311.pdf |publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics |accessdate=August 30, 2014 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907020823/http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/hcv0311.pdf |archivedate=September 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/hcrvp.pdf Hate Crime Reported by Victims and Police], Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report, November 2005, NCJ 209911.&lt;/ref&gt; However, from 2011 to 2012, violent hate crimes against Hispanic people increased by 300%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/spotlight/hate_crimes/facts.html | title=Highlights from Hate Crime Victimization, 2004–2012 – Statistical Tables | publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics | accessdate=June 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When considering all hate crimes, and not just violent ones, African Americans are far more likely to be victims than other racial groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2010/narratives/hate-crime-2010-incidents-and-offenses | title=FBI – Incidents and Offenses | publisher=Criminal Justice Information Services | accessdate=June 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/fbi-blacks-often-targeted-hate-crimes/ | title=FBI: Blacks most often targeted in hate crimes | publisher=PBS | date=June 20, 2015 | accessdate=June 20, 2016 | author=Sreenivasan, Hari}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Century Foundation]], a [[white nationalist]] organization founded by [[Jared Taylor]], argues that blacks are more likely than whites to commit hate crimes, and that FBI figures inflate the number of hate crimes committed by whites by counting Hispanics as "white".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nc-f.org/colorcrime1999.htm The Color of Crime], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Other analysts are sharply critical of the NCF's findings, referring to the mainstream criminological view that "Racial and ethnic data must be treated with caution. Existing research on crime has generally shown that racial or ethnic identity is not predictive of criminal behavior with data which has been controlled for social and economic factors."&lt;ref&gt;Preface to Minnesota's official crime data reports, quoted in Southern Poverty Law Center, [http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=255 Coloring Crime].&lt;/ref&gt; NCF's methodology and statistics are further sharply criticized as flawed and deceptive by anti-racist activists Tim Wise and the Southern Poverty Law Center.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Wise, "[http://www.lipmagazine.org/~timwise/colorofdeception.html The Color of Deception: Race, Crime and Sloppy Social Science]," 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Southern Poverty Law Center, [http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=255 Coloring Crime].&lt;/ref&gt;

The first post-Jim Crow era hate crime to make sensational media attention was the [[murder of Vincent Chin]], an Asian American of Chinese descent in 1982. He was attacked by two white assailants who were recently laid off from a Detroit area auto factory job and blamed the Japanese for their individual unemployment. Chin was not of Japanese descent, but the assailants testified at the criminal court case that he "looked like a Jap", an ethnic slur used to describe Japanese and other Asians, and that they were angry enough to beat him to death.

=== Hateful views ===
Continuing [[antisemitism in the United States]] has remained an issue as the 2011 ''Survey of American Attitudes Toward Jews in America'', released by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), has found that the recent [[Late-2000s recession|world economic recession]] increased some antisemitic viewpoints among Americans. Most people express [[Philo-Semitism|pro-Jewish sentiments]], with 64% of those surveyed agreeing that Jews have contributed much to U.S. social culture. Yet the polling found that 19% of Americans answered "probably true" to the [[antisemitic canard]] that "Jews have too much control/influence on Wall Street" while 15% concurred with the related statement that Jews seem "more willing to use shady practices" in business. Reflecting on the lingering antisemitism of about one in five Americans, [[Abraham H. Foxman]], ADL national director, has argued, "It is disturbing that with all of the strides we have made in becoming a more tolerant society, anti-Semitic beliefs continue to hold a vice-grip on a small but not insubstantial segment of the American public."&lt;ref name=adl-poll&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/ADL-poll-Anti-Semitic-attitudes-on-rise-in-USA|title=ADL poll: Anti-Semitic attitudes on rise in USA|publisher=''[[The Jerusalem Post]]''|date=November 3, 2011|accessdate=December 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[ABC News]] report in 2007 recounted that past ABC polls across several years have tended to find that "six percent have self-reported prejudice against Jews, 27 percent against Muslims, 25 percent against Arabs," and "one in 10 concedes harboring at least some such feelings" against [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic Americans]]. The report also remarked that a full 34% of Americans reported "some racist feelings" in general as a self-description.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/images/US/1048a1Hispanics.pdf|title=Aquí Se Habla Español – and Two-Thirds Don't Mind|publisher=''[[ABC News]]''|date=October 8, 2007|accessdate=December 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Associated Press]] and [[Yahoo News]] survey of 2,227 adult Americans in 2008 found that 10% of white respondents stated that "a lot" of discrimination against African-Americans exists while 45% answered "some" compared to 57% of black respondents answering that "a lot" exists. In the same poll, more whites applied positive attributes to black Americans than negative ones, with blacks describing whites even more highly, but a significant minority of whites still called their fellow Americans "irresponsible", "lazy", or other such things.&lt;ref name=babington&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Sep22/0,4670,APYahooPollRaceinAmerica,00.html |title=Poll: Views still differ sharply by race |first=Charles |last=Babington |publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] |date=September 22, 2008 |accessdate=January 16, 2010 |quote=[A] new Associated Press-Yahoo News poll, conducted with Stanford University, shows... that a substantial portion of white Americans still harbor negative feelings toward blacks.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Stanford University political scientist Paul Sniderman remarked that, in the modern U.S., racism and prejudices are "a deep challenge, and it's one that Americans in general, and for that matter, political scientists, just haven't been ready to acknowledge fully."&lt;ref name=babington /&gt;

== Alleviation ==
There is a wide plethora of societal and political suggestions to alleviate the effects of continued discrimination in the United States. For example, within universities, it has been suggested that a type of committee could respond to non-sanctionable behavior.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt;

It is also argued that there is a need for "white students and faculty to reformulate white-awareness toward a more secure identity that is not threatened by black cultural institutions and that can recognize the racial non-neutrality of the institutions whites dominate" (Brown, 334). Paired with this effort, Brown encourages the increase in minority faculty members, so the embedded white normative experience begins to fragment.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt;

Within media, it is found that racial cues prime racial stereotypic thought. Thus, it is argued that "stereotype inconsistent cues might lead to more intentioned thought, thereby suppressing racial priming effects."&lt;ref name=Valentino /&gt;
