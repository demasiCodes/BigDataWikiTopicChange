'''Racism in the United States''' has been a major issue since the colonial era. Historically, the country has been dominated by a [[settler|settler society]] of religiously and ethnically diverse [[White American|Whites]]. The heaviest burdens of [[racism]] in the country have historically fallen upon [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], [[Asian American]]s, [[African American]]s, [[Hispanics in the United States|Latin Americans]], [[American Jews]], [[Irish American]]s and some other [[Immigration to the United States|immigrant groups]] and their descendants.

Major racially structured institutions include slavery, Indian reservations, segregation, residential schools (for Native Americans), internment camps, and affirmative action. [[Race (classification of human beings)|Racial]] [[social stratification|stratification]] has occurred in employment, housing, education and government. Formal racial discrimination was largely banned in the mid-20th century, and it came to be perceived as socially unacceptable and/or morally repugnant as well, yet racial politics remain a major phenomenon.

Racist attitudes, or [[prejudice]], are still held by significant portions of the U.S population. Members of every American ethnic group have perceived racism in their dealings with other groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j6qHU0LD6MvZS2pj_v1XTg6OOk2A AFP: US minorities don't trust each other]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=28501933d0e5c5344b21f9640dc13754 Deep Divisions, Shared Destiny - A Poll of Black, Hispanic, and Asian Americans on Race Relations]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also to note the definition of "White" has changed over time; many European groups, such as Irish and Italians, were not considered "White" when they first immigrated to the United States, and were victims of racial discrimination at that time). White Americans occasionally do experience racial discrimination; it is [[Racism#Sociological|disputed]] whether this is properly termed "racism," and, in general, since other groups have less economic and social power, it is uncommon that such discrimination has the power to seriously harm Whites.

===Racism against Native Americans===
{{Main|Native Americans in the United States}}

[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who had lived on the North America continent for at least 15,000 years, had an enormously complex impact on American history and racial relations. During the colonial and independent periods, a long series of conflicts were waged, with the primary objective of obtaining resources of Native Americans. Through [[List of wars|wars]], [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacres]], [[population transfer|forced displacement]] (such as in the [[Trail of Tears]]), and the imposition of treaties, land was taken and numerous hardships imposed. In 1540 AD, the first racial strife was with Spaniard [[Hernando de Soto]]'s expedition who enslaved and murdered many [[New World]] communities. In the early 1700s, the English had enslaved nearly 800 Choctaws.&lt;ref name=brescia_era&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; After the creation of the United States, the idea of [[Indian removal]] gained momentum. However, some Native Americans choose to remain and avoided removal where they were subjected to racist institutions in their ancient homeland . The Choctaws in [[Mississippi]] described their situation in 1849, "we have had our habitations torn down and burned, our fences destroyed, cattle turned into our fields and we ourselves have been scourged, manacled, fettered and otherwise personally abused, until by such treatment some of our best men have died."&lt;ref name=peterson&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph B.

The Choctaw and Chickasaw, the tribes he knew best, were beneath contempt, that is, even worse than black slaves."&lt;ref name=charles_hudson&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideological expansionist justification ([[Manifest Destiny]]) included stereotyped perceptions of all Native Americans as "merciless Indian savages" (as described in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]) despite successful American efforts at civilization as proven with the [[Cherokee]], [[Chickasaw]], [[Creek (people)|Creek]], and [[Choctaw]]. The most egregious attempt occurred with the [[California gold rush]], the first two years of which saw the deaths of thousands of Native Americans. Under [[Alta California|Mexican rule in California]], Indians were subjected to ''de facto'' enslavement under a system of [[peon]]age. While in 1850, California formally entered the [[United States|Union]] as a [[Free state (United States)|free state]], with respect to the issue of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], the practice of Indian [[Indentured servant|indentured servitude]] was not outlawed by the [[California State Legislature|California Legislature]] until 1863.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward D. Castillo|Castillo, Edward D.]] (1998). ''[http://www.ceres.ca.gov/nahc/califindian.html Short Overview of California Indian History]", California Native American Heritage Commission.&lt;/ref&gt;

Military and civil resistance by Native Americans has been a constant feature of American history. So too have a variety of debates around issues of sovereignty, the upholding of treaty provisions, and the civil rights of Native Americans under U.S. law.

====Discrimination, marginalization====
Once their territories were incorporated into the United States, surviving Native Americans were denied equality before the law and often treated as wards of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.eskimo.com/~recall/bleed/0303.htm
|accessdate=2008-01-28
|title=Our Daily Bleed...
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2007}} Many Native Americans were relegated to reservations&amp;mdash;constituting just 4% of U.S. territory&amp;mdash;and the treaties signed with them violated. Tens of thousands of American Indians and Alaska Natives were forced to attend a [[Indian boarding school|residential school system]] which sought to reeducate them in white settler American values, culture and economy, to "kill the Indian, sav[ing] the man."&lt;ref&gt;Ward Churchill, ''Kill the Indian, Save the Man'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further dispossession continued through concessions for industries such as oil, mining and timber and through division of land through legislation such as the Allotment Act. These concessions have raised problems of consent, exploitation of low royalty rates, environmental injustice, and gross mismanagement of funds held in trust, resulting in the loss of $10–40 billion.&lt;ref&gt;United States Senate, [http://www.indiantrust.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=OtherMedia.ViewDetail&amp;Other_id=12&amp;Month=3&amp;Year=2007 Oversight Hearing on Trust Fund Litigation, Cobell v. Kempthorne]. See also, [[Cobell v. Norton]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Worldwatch Institute]] notes that 317 reservations are threatened by environmental hazards, while [[Western Shoshone]] land has been subjected to more than 1,000 nuclear explosions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Winona LaDuke]], ''All Our Relations: Native Struggles for Land and Life'', 1999, p. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Native American owned slaves====
Before removal, some Southern Native American tribes owned African American slaves. The Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw were known to have had slaves. Just as they adopted European American culture (Christianity, yeoman farming techniques, and educational institutions), they also adopted slavery. But unlike the United States before [[Emancipation]], African Americans (and European Americans) were allowed to become citizens of their respective Native American nations; however, it was rare for a African Americans to become citizens of Native American nations.  For example, a small number of "Free People of Color" lived in many Native American nations as Cherokee, Choctaw, or Creek citizens.&lt;ref name="first"&gt;

====Assimilation efforts into American society====

[[George Washington]] and [[Henry Knox]] believed that Native Americans were equals but that their society was inferior.

The [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]] granted U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans. Prior to the passage of the act, nearly two-thirds of Native Americans were already U.S. citizens.&lt;ref name=2-3_us_citizenship&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded date of Native Americans becoming U.S. citizens was in 1831 when the Mississippi [[Choctaw]] became citizens after the United States Legislature ratified the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek. Under article XIV of that treaty, any Choctaw who elected not to move to Native American Territory could become an American citizen when he registered and if he stayed on designated lands for five years after treaty ratification. Citizenship could also be obtained by:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
1. Treaty Provision (as with the Mississippi Choctaw) &lt;br /&gt;
2. Allotment under the [[Dawes Act|Act of February 8, 1887]]&lt;br /&gt;
3. Issuance of Patent in Fee Simple  &lt;br /&gt;
4. Adopting Habits of Civilized Life  &lt;br /&gt;
5. Minor Children  &lt;br /&gt;
6. Citizenship by Birth  &lt;br /&gt;
7. Becoming Soldiers and Sailors in the U.S. Armed Forces  &lt;br /&gt;
8. Marriage  &lt;br /&gt;
9. Special Act of Congress.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{cquote|''Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That all noncitizen Native Americans born within the territorial limits of the United States be, and they are hereby, declared to be citizens of the United States: Provided, That the granting of such citizenship shall not in any manner impair or otherwise affect the right of any Native American to tribal or other property.''|20px|20px|-''Indian Citizenship Act of 1924''}}

While formal equality has been legally granted, [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], [[Alaska Natives]], [[Native Hawaiians]], and [[Pacific Islanders]] remain among the most economically disadvantaged groups in the country, and according to National mental health studies, American Indians are the most affected racial group to suffer from high levels of alcoholism, depression and suicide. {{Or|date=May 2007}}

===Racism against African Americans===
{{Main|African American history}}

==== Slavery and emancipation ====
{{Refimprove|section|date=November 2009}}
In colonial America, before [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] became completely based on racial lines, thousands of African slaves served European colonists, alongside other Europeans serving a term of [[indentured servitude]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/ashorthistory/archive/intro99.shtml The curse of Cromwell]&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases for African slaves, a term of service meant freedom and a land grant afterward, but these were rarely awarded, and few former slaves became landowners this way.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} In a precursor to the American Revolution, [[Nathaniel Bacon]] led a [[Bacon's Rebellion|revolt]] in 1676 against the Governor of [[Virginia]] and the system of exploitation he represented: exploitation of poorer colonists by the increasingly wealthy landowners where poorer people, regardless of skin color, fought side by side. However, Bacon died, probably of [[dysentery]]; hundreds of participants in the revolt were lured to disarm by a promised [[amnesty]]; and the revolt lost steam.&lt;ref name="worldbook-nb"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | year = 1992 | title = Bacon, Nathaniel | encyclopedia = The World Book Encyclopedia | publisher = World Book | id = ISBN 0-7166-0092-7 |pages = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slaves were primarily used for [[agriculture|agricultural]] labor, notably in the production of [[cotton]] and [[tobacco]]. Black slavery in the Northeast was common until the early 19th century, when many Northeastern states abolished slavery. Slaves were used as a labor force in agricultural production, shipyards, docks, and as domestic servants. In both regions, only the wealthiest Americans owned slaves.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} In contrast, poor whites recognized that slavery devalued their own labor. The social rift along color lines soon became ingrained in every aspect of colonial American culture.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Approximately one Southern family in four held slaves prior to war. According to the 1860 U.S. census, there were about 385,000 slaveowners out of approximately 1.5 million white families.&lt;ref&gt;Alonzo L. Hamby, George Clack, and Mildred Sola Neely. [http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/historybrf/index.htm Outline of US History.] A publication of the US Department of State.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Constitution had banned the importation of new African slaves in 1808, and in 1820 slave trade was equated with piracy, punishable
by death,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pdavis.nl/SlaverBackground.htm The legal and diplomatic background to the seizure of foreign vessels]&lt;/ref&gt; the practice of chattel slavery still existed for the next half century. All slaves in only the areas of the [[Confederate States of America]] that were not under direct control of the United States government were declared free by the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which was issued on January 1, 1863 by President [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=34 Emancipation Proclamation (1863)]&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] did not apply to areas loyal to, or controlled by, the Union, thus the document only freed slaves where the Union still had not regained the legitimacy to do so. Slavery was not actually abolished in the United States until the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] which was declared ratified on December 6, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/amend1.htm#13 XIII - Slavery Abolished] The Avalon Project&lt;/ref&gt;

About 4 million [[African American|black]] [[slavery|slaves]] were freed in 1865. Ninety-five percent of blacks lived in the South, comprising one third of the population there as opposed to one percent of the population of the North. Consequently, fears of eventual emancipation were much greater in the South than in the North.&lt;ref&gt;James McPherson, Drawn with the Sword, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all [[white American|white]] males aged 13 to 43 died in the civil war, including 6% in the North and an extraordinary 18% in the South.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/050155.html The Deadliest War]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, post-emancipation America was not free from racism; discriminatory practices continued in the United States with the existence of [[Jim Crow laws]], educational disparities and widespread criminal acts against people of color.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

====Nadir of American race relations====
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
{{Main|Nadir of American race relations |Mass racial violence in the United States}}
[[Image:Lynching-of-will-james.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The mob-style [[lynching in the United States|lynching]] of Will James, Cairo, Illinois, 1909.]]
The new century saw a hardening of institutionalized racism and legal discrimination against citizens of African descent in the United States. Although technically able to vote, [[poll tax]]es, acts of terror (often perpetuated by groups such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]], founded in the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] South), and discriminatory laws such as [[grandfather clause]]s kept black Americans disenfranchised particularly in the South but also nationwide following the [[Rutherford B. Hayes|Hayes]] election at the end of the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] era in 1877. In response to [[de jure]] racism, protest and lobbyist groups emerged, most notably, the [[NAACP]] (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) in 1909.

This time period is sometimes referred to as the [[nadir of American race relations]] because racism in the United States was worse during this time than at any period before or since. [[Racial segregation|Segregation]], [[racial discrimination]], and expressions of white supremacy all increased. So did anti-black violence, including [[lynchings]] and [[race riot]]s.

In addition, racism which had been viewed primarily as a problem in the Southern states, burst onto the national consciousness following the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], the relocation of millions of African Americans from their roots in the Southern states to the industrial centers of the North after World War I, particularly in cities such as [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], and [[New York City|New York]] ([[Harlem]]). In northern cities, racial tensions exploded, most violently in Chicago, and [[lynching in the United States|lynchings]]--mob-directed hangings, usually racially motivated—increased dramatically in the 1920s.

====American Civil Rights movement====
{{Main|American Civil Rights movement}}
[[Image:1963 march lincoln memorial.jpg|230px|thumb|right|Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial]]
Prominent African American politicians, entertainers and activists pushed for civil rights throughout the twentieth century, quite noticeably during the 1930s and 1940s with noted allies including [[First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], who facilitated singer [[Marian Anderson]]'s famous 1939 [[Easter]] concert when segregated venues would not accommodate her.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/tmirhfee.html February 26, 1939 Eleanor Roosevelt Resigns from the Daughters of the American Revolution]," Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Activists, particularly [[A. Philip Randolph]] agitated for civil rights throughout the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]] years, organizing protest marches and seeking government concessions. The efforts of civil rights activists began to bear fruit with the issuance of wartime [[Executive Order 8802]], signed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on June 25, 1941 to prohibit [[racism|racial discrimination]] in the national [[Defense contractor|defense industry]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Takaki, ''A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America'' (New York: Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1993), 397.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by [[Executive Order 9981]] by President [[Harry S. Truman]] in July 1948, which banned [[racial segregation]] in the [[United States of America|American]] armed forces, and the creation of the [[U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] in 1957. The 1950s and 1960s saw the peaking of the American [[Civil Rights Movement]] and the desegregation of schools under the 1954 [[Supreme Court]] case [[Brown v. Board]] and the organizing of widespread protests across the nation under a younger generation of leaders.&lt;ref name=Takaki-CivRights&gt;Ronald Takaki, ''A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America'' (New York: Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1993), 400-414.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pastor and activist [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] was the catalyst for many [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] protests in the 1960s which led to the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].&lt;ref name=PivenCloward&gt;Frances Fox Piven and Richard A. Cloward, ''Poor People’s Movements: Why They Succeed, How They Fail'' (New York: Vintage Books, 1979 [1977]), ch. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This signified a change in the social acceptance of legislative racism in America and a profound increase in the number of opportunities available for people of color in the United States.&lt;ref name=PivenCloward /&gt; While substantial gains were made in the succeeding decades through middle class advancement and public employment, black poverty and lack of education&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jbhe.com/latest/122905_statistical_shocker2005.html JBHE Statistical Shocker of the Year]&lt;/ref&gt; deepened in the context of de-industrialization.&lt;ref name=Takaki-CivRights /&gt;

Many cite the [[2008 United States presidential election]] as a step forward in race relations: White Americans played a role in electing [[Barack Obama]], the country's first black president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-na-assess5-2008nov05,0,6354926.story White Americans play major role in electing the first black president], Los Angeles Times&lt;/ref&gt;However, according to exit polls, over sixty percent of white Americans voted for McCain. Barack Obama receives over thirty death threats a day, higher than Bush or Clinton, which has led some to question tolerance in white America.

=== Discrimination and racism against Asian-Americans ===
[[Image:YellowTerror.jpg|thumb|A Sinophobic cartoon called "Yellow terror" appearing in the United States in 1899]]
{{See also|Sinophobia|Chinese American history|Yellow Peril|Turban Tide and Hindoo Invasion}}
In the [[Pacific States]], racism was primarily directed against the resident Asian immigrants. Several immigration laws discriminated against the Asians, and at different points the ethnic Chinese or other groups were banned from entering the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/learn/features/immig/chinese6.html Immigration...Chinese:Exclusion]&lt;/ref&gt; Nonwhites were prohibited from testifying against whites, a prohibition extended to the Chinese by [[People v. Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cetel.org/1854_hall.html Text of People v. Hall decision]&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese were often subject to harder labor on the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] and often performed the more dangerous tasks such as using dynamite to make pathways through the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Takaki, ''A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America'' (New York: Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1993), 196-98.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[San Francisco Vigilance Movement]], although ostensibly a response to crime and corruption, also systematically victimized Irish immigrants, and later this was transformed into mob violence against Chinese immigrants. {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Legal discrimination of Asian minorities was furthered with the passages of the [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882]], which banned the entrance of virtually all ethnic Chinese immigrants into the United States until 1943.

During World War II, the United States created [[Japanese American internment|internment camps for Japanese American citizens]] in fear that they would be used as spies for the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foitimes.com/ Internment of German Americans in the United States during World War II&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The executive order hasn't affected any Japanese populations in the Eastern US and the large Japanese population in Hawaii.

===Discrimination against Latin Americans===
Americans of Latin American ancestry (often categorized as "[[Hispanic]]") come from a wide variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds. 
Latinos are not all distinguishable as a racial minority. 

The [[Zoot Suit Riots]] were vivid incidents of racial violence against Latinos (e.g. [[Mexican-Americans]]) in [[Los Angeles]] in 1943. Naval servicemen stationed in a Latino neighborhood conflicted with youth in the dense neighborhood. Frequent confrontations between small groups and individuals had intensified into several days of non-stop rioting. Large mobs of servicemen would enter civilian quarters looking to attack Mexican American youths, some of whom were wearing [[zoot suit]]s, a distinctive exaggerated fashion popular among that group.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Griswold del Castillo, "The Los Angeles "Zoot Suit Riots" Revisited: Mexican and Latin American Perspectives," ''Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos'', Vol. 16, No. 2. (Summer, 2000), pp. 367-391.&lt;/ref&gt; The disturbances continued unchecked, and even assisted, by the local police for several days before based commanders declared downtown Los Angeles and Mexican American neighborhoods off-limits to servicemen.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur C. Verge, "The Impact of the Second World War on Los Angeles," The Pacific Historical Review, Vol. 63, No. 3, Fortress California at War: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Diego, 1941-1945. (Aug., 1994), pp. 306-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

=== West Coast racism ===
The Pacific and [[Western United States|Western]] states were often portrayed to those on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] as more liberal in terms of race relations in the 1960s and 1970s, but California legally allowed racial segregation of public facilities until the 1950s and other forms of racism were felt there as well.

{{See also|History of Oregon Racial Discrimination}}
A variety of laws were enacted to prevent African American migration to the [[Pacific Northwest]]. While slavery was criminalized in the [[Oregon Territory]] in 1844, a so-called "lash law" subjected blacks found guilty of violating the law to whippings—no less than 20 and no more than 39 strokes of the lash—every six months "until he or she shall quit the territory." An exclusion law, barring African Americans from entering the territory was passed in 1847, repealed in 1854, and added to the new Oregon state constitution in 1857. While African Americans have been present at some level since 1805, the demographic reverberations of these laws remain today.&lt;ref name=BlackTimeline&gt;[http://www.endoftheoregontrail.org/blaktime.html Timeline of Black History in the Pacific Northwest]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hate crimes===
Most [[hate crimes]] in the United States target victims on the basis of race or ethnicity (for Federal purposes, crimes targeting Hispanics based on that identity are considered based on ethnicity). Leading forms of bias cited in the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, based on law enforcement agency filings are: anti-black, anti-Jewish, anti-white, anti-homosexual, and anti-Hispanic bias in that order in both 2004 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2004/openpage.htm Hate Crime Statistics, 2004]. [http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2005/index.html Hate Crime Statistics, 2005].&lt;/ref&gt; There are more hate crimes against whites than against Hispanics, Asians, American-Indians and multiple-race groups - a statistically expected trend given that there far more whites than other ethnic groups put together. By contrast, the National Criminal Victimization Survey, finds that per capita rates of hate crime victimization varied little by race or ethnicity, and the differences are not statistically significant.&lt;ref&gt;[www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/hcrvp.pdf Hate Crime Reported by Victims
and Police], Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report, November 2005, NCJ 209911.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Century Foundation]], a [[white nationalist]] organization founded by [[Jared Taylor]], argues that blacks are more likely than whites to commit hate crimes, and that FBI figures inflate the number of hate crimes committed by whites by counting Hispanics as "white".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nc-f.org/colorcrime1999.htm The Color of Crime], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Other analysts are sharply critical of the NCF's findings, referring to the criminological mainstream view that "Racial and ethnic data must be treated with caution. ... Existing research on crime has generally shown that racial or ethnic identity is not predictive of criminal behavior with data which has been controlled for social and economic factors."&lt;ref&gt;Preface to Minnesota's official crime data reports, quoted in Southern Poverty Law Center, [http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=255 Coloring Crime].&lt;/ref&gt; NCF's methodology and statistics are further sharply criticized as flawed and deceptive by anti-racist activists Tim Wise and the Southern Poverty Law Center.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Wise, "[http://www.lipmagazine.org/~timwise/colorofdeception.html The Color of Deception: Race, Crime and Sloppy Social Science]," 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Southern Poverty Law Center, [http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=255 Coloring Crime].&lt;/ref&gt;

The first post-Jim Crow era hate crime to make sensational media attention was the beating death of [[Vincent Chin]], an Asian American of Chinese descent in 1982. He was attacked by a mob of white assailants who were recently laid off from a Detroit area auto factory job and blamed the Japanese for their individual unemployment. Chin was not of Japanese descent but the assailants testified at the criminal court case that he "looked like a Jap", an ethnic slur used to describe Japanese and other Asians, and that they were angry enough to beat him to death. They served no jail time and were acquitted of all charges. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Antisemitism===
{{Main|Antisemitism in the United States}}
[[Antisemitism]] has also played a role in America. During the late 1800s and early 1900s, hundreds of thousands of [[Ashkenazi]] [[Jews]] were escaping the [[pogroms]] of [[Russia]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. They boarded boats from ports on the Baltic Sea and in Northern [[Germany]], and largely arrived at [[Ellis Island]], [[New York]].&lt;ref name=Takaki-JewishMigr&gt;Ronald Takaki, ''A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America'' (New York: Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1993), 277-283.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought by [[Leo Rosten]], in his book, '[[The Joys of Yiddish]]', that as soon as they left the boat, they were subject to racism from the port immigration authorities. The derogatory term '[[kike]]' was adopted when referring to Jews (because they often could not write so they may have signed their immigration papers with circles - or kikel in [[Yiddish]]).&lt;ref&gt;Rosten, Leo (1968) "The Joys of Yiddish"&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1910s, the Southern Jewish communities were attacked by the [[Ku Klux Klan]], who objected to Jewish immigration, and often used 'The Jewish Banker' in their propaganda. In 1915, [[Texas]]-born, [[New York]] [[Jew]] [[Leo Frank]] was lynched by the newly re-formed Klan, after being convicted of rape and sentenced to death (his punishment was commuted to life imprisonment).&lt;ref name="lynching openly organized"&gt;Phagan, 1987, p. 27, states that "everyone knew the identity of the lynchers" (putting the words in her father's mouth). Oney, 2003, p. 526, quotes Carl Abernathy as saying, "They'd go to a man's office and talk to him or ... see a man on the job and talk to him," and an unidentified lyncher as saying "The organization of the body was more open than mysterious."&lt;/ref&gt;

The events in [[Nazi Germany]] also attracted attention from America. Jewish lobbying for intervention in Europe drew opposition from the [[isolationists]], amongst whom was Father [[Charles Coughlin]], a well known radio priest, who was known to be critical of Jews, believing that they were leading America into the war.&lt;ref name="Coughlin"&gt;[http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/53/coughlin.html Father Charles Edward Coughlin (1891-1971)] By Richard Sanders, Editor, Press for Conversion!&lt;/ref&gt; He preached in weekly, overtly [[anti-Semitic]] sermons and, from 1936, began publication of a newspaper, Social Justice, in which he printed anti-Semitic accusations such as [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]].&lt;ref name="Coughlin"&gt;Mary Christine Athans, "A New Perspective on Father Charles E. Coughlin," ''Church History'', Vol. 56, No. 2. (Jun., 1987), pp. 224-235.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Jewish organizations, Christian organizations, Muslim organizations, and academics consider the [[Nation of Islam]] to be [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]]. Specifically, they claim that the Nation of Islam has engaged in revisionist and antisemitic interpretations of the Holocaust and exaggerates the role of Jews in the African slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~antis/papers/occasional.papers.html H-ANTISEMITISM OCCASIONAL PAPERS, NO. 1M&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) alleges that NOI Health Minister, Abdul Alim Muhammad, has accused Jewish doctors of injecting blacks with the [[AIDS]] virus,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/focus_sheets/focus_islam.asp Nation of Islam&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; an allegation that Dr. Abdul Alim Muhammad has denied.

===Anti-White racism===

In the [[United States]], there have been crimes committed against [[White Americans]] on the basis of their ethnicity. One series of unprovoked crimes that specifically targeted [[White Americans]] is the [[Zebra murders]] that occurred in San Francisco between 1973 and 1974. The Zebra murders were carried out by a group known as Death Angels (a radical splinter group of the [[Nation of Islam]]) that intended to kill whites to spread terror and earn favor and status within their sect. The final death count varies depending on which killings are included, but it is believed to account for more than 71 murders in addition to numerous rapes and attempted murders.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Another series of crimes that specifically targeted whites is the 2002 [[Beltway sniper attacks]] which planned to kill six whites a day for 30 days,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1519411/The-snipers-plan-kill-six-whites-a-day-for-30-days.html The sniper's plan: kill six whites a day for 30 days]&lt;/ref&gt; and resulted in 10 deaths and 3 critical injuries. One of the snipers [[Lee Boyd Malvo]] testified that [[John Allen Muhammad]] was driven by hatred of America because of its "slavery, hypocrisy and foreign policy" and his belief that "the white man is the devil."

According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, national anti-white hate groups that are currently active include [[Nation of Islam]] and [[New Black Panther Party]].

According to [[FBI]] statistics from 1995-2002, Whites are the second most targeted group for racially motivated hate crime in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/2/6/3/7/p126377_index.html What factors lead to cross-sectional variation in anti-White hate crime on the community district level?], American Society of Criminology (ASC)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Affirmative action]] is sometimes called "reverse racism" by its [[Affirmative_action#Opposition|opponents]]; [[Racism#Sociological|some sociologists argue]] that the term "racism" can only be applied to structured systems of racial supremacy, and that opponents would more correctly call affirmative action "reverse [[discrimination]]."&lt;ref name=Cazenave&gt;{{cite book | last = Cazenave | first = Noël A. | coauthors = Darlene Alvarez | title = “Defending the White Race:White Male Faculty Opposition to a White Racism Course” Race and Society 2 | date = 1999 | pages = 25–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Persian people]] (who constitute a completely different set of ethnic groups than Arabs), as well as [[South Asians]] of different ethnic/religious backgrounds (Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs) have been stereotyped as "Arabs". The case of [[Balbir Singh Sodhi]], a Sikh who was murdered at a Phoenix gas station by a [[white supremacist]] for "looking like an Arab terrorist" (because of the turban that is a requirement of [[Sikhism]]), as well as that of Hindus being attacked for "being Muslims" have achieved prominence and criticism following the September 11 attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/11/25/national/main530749.shtml Hindu Beaten Because He's Muslim, Mistaken Anti-Islam Thugs Pummel, Hogtie And Stab Deliveryman - CBS News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.adl.org/presrele/hatcr_51/4277_51.asp |title = ADL Condemns Hate Crime Against Hindu |accessdate = 2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The November 1979 [[Iranian hostage crisis]] of the U.S. embassy in [[Tehran]] precipitated a wave of anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States, directed both against the [[Iranian Revolution|new Islamic regime]] and Iranian nationals and immigrants. Even though such sentiments gradually declined after the release of the hostages at the start of 1981, they sometimes flare up. In response, some Iranian immigrants to the U.S. have distanced themselves from their nationality and instead identify primarily on the basis of their ethnic or religious affiliations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mehdi|last=Bozorgmehr|title=No solidarity: Iranians in the U.S.|url=http://www.Iranian.com/Opinion/2001/May/Iranians/index.html#3a|work=The Iranian|date=[[2001-05-02]]|accessdate=2007-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racism as a factor in U.S. foreign policy==
{{Citations missing|date=August 2008}}
The earliest decades of expansionist [[United States foreign policy]] making was often accompanied by racialist ideological justifications. While pursuing a series of expansionist wars (see "Racism against Native Americans" above), American leaders embraced and ideology of [[white supremacy|white racial supremacy]]. [[George Washington]] predicted at the end of the [[U.S. Revolutionary War]], “The gradual extension of our settlements will as certainly cause the savage, as the wolf, to retire; both being beasts of prey, tho' they differ in shape."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Noam Chomsky, ''Year 501: The Conquest Continues'', (Boston: South End Press, 1993), 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The successful slave revolution in [[Haiti]] alarmed the United States leadership, and the country refused diplomatic recognition for decades. The United States conquest of [[Florida]] and the [[Seminole Wars]] were fought in part to confront the danger of "mingled hordes of lawless Indians and negroes," in the words of President John Quincy Adams.&lt;ref name=Year501p24&gt;Quoted in Noam Chomsky, ''Year 501: The Conquest Continues'', (Boston: South End Press, 1993), 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early 20th-century President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] declared, "The most ultimately righteous of all wars is a war with savages" and openly spoke of cementing the rule of "dominant world races."&lt;ref name=Year501p24 /&gt; In line with the concepts of the "[[Manifest Destiny]]" of white Anglo-Americans to conquer lands inhabited by "inferior" races of Native Americans and Mexicans, and the "White Man's Burden" of Europeans' obligation to introduce civilization to the "primitive" people of Africa, Asia and the Pacific, American foreign policy in the early 20th century had racial overtones of a "superior" race destined to rule the world.

Critics such as [[Gore Vidal]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] have suggested that racism has played a significant role in U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East and its treatment of the Arabs. Various critics have suggested that racism along with strategic and financial interests motivated the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush Administration]] to attack Iraq even though the [[Baath]]ist regime of [[Saddam Hussein]] did not possess weapons of mass destruction nor had any ties to [[Al Qaida]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merip.org/mero/interventions/lockman_interv.html MERIP Interventions: Behind the Battles Over US Middle East Studies, by Zachary Lockman&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediamonitors.net/kristenschurr1.html Racism in Reporting, Jingoism as Foreign Policy (by Kristen Schurr) - Media Monitors Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E6DA153BF93BA35750C0A964948260]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some scholars believe that the United States has softened racial restrictions based on foreign policy concerns. For example, Congress eliminated racial bars on Asian immigration during [[World War II]] and the [[Vietnam War]] to recognize American allies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1121504 Gabriel J.

==Conflicts between racial and ethnic minorities==

Minority racism is sometimes considered controversial because of theories of [[power (sociology)|power]] in society.

=== Strife, conflict and reconcilation ===
{{Refimprove|section|date=November 2009}}
{{Original research|section|date=November 2009}}
The U.S. has long had experienced conflict and reconcilation between ethnic minority groups.

Historians point out after a period of conflict, ethnic and racial groups can band together in solidarity. For example, the competiting [[Irish-American]] and [[Italian-American]] groups once held aminousity against each other in the early 20th century, would later merge and also with [[Polish-Americans]], [[German-Americans]] and [[French-Canadians]] in the U.S. because of the commonality as "ethnics" and [[Roman Catholics]] in a primarily Protestant Anglo America by the 1940s and '50s. The modern American consciousness on race will consider descendants of European ethnic groups assimilated to become part of the larger "[[White American]]" group. 

In the 1960s &amp; '70s, African-American and [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican]] political activism banded together to battle the common problems of racial discrimination, poverty and underpresentation in many urban areas across the US like in [[New York City]]. Also to note there was substantial intermarriage between the newly-arrived [[Indian American]], later came the [[Filipino]] and Hispanic communities in California under similar working conditions and shared cultural values in the 1920s (see [[Punjabi Mexican American]]).

The current-day social melange of "minorities" and "people of color" echoes the previous experience of European ethnic groups' sense of "otherness" about 2 or 3 generations ago.

==Stereotypes and prejudice==
{{Expand|date=October 2007}}
[[Image:1900sc Mammy Card Interracial.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This racist [[postcard]] from the 1900s shows the casual denigration of black women. It states "I know you're not particular to a fault / Though I'm not sure you'll never be sued for assault / You're so fond of women that even a wench / Attracts your gross fancy despite her strong stench"]]

===Stereotypical images in the entertainment media===
Popular culture (songs, theater) for European-American audiences in the nineteenth century created and perpetuated negative stereotypes of African-Americans. One key symbol of racism against African Americans was the use of [[blackface]]. Directly related to this was the institution of [[minstrelsy]].

=== Contemporary images and protests ===
Increasing numbers of African-American activists have asserted that [[rap music]] videos utilize African-American performers commonly enacting [[trope (literature)|trope]]s of scantily clothed women and men as thugs or pimps. Church organized groups have protested outside the residence of Phillipe Dauman (Upper East Side (New York, NY)) (president and chief executive officer of [[Viacom]]) and the residence of Debra L. Lee (Northwest Washington DC) (chairman and chief executive of [[Black Entertainment Television]], a unit of Viacom). Rev. Donald Coates, leader of a protest organization formed around the issue of the videos, "Enough is Enough!" said, “In the wake of the [[Don Imus|Imus]] affair, I began to think that the African-American community must be consistent in its outrage.” The Clifton, Maryland ministered has also said, “Why are these corporations making these images normative and mainstream?” . . . . “I can talk about this in the church until I am blue in the face, but we need to take it outside.” The [[NAACP]] and the National Congress of Black Women also have called for the reform of images on videos and on television. [[Julian Bond]] said that in a segregated society, people get their impressions of other groups from what they see in videos and what they hear in music.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;Felicia R. Lee, "Protesting Demeaning Images in Media" "New York Times" November 5, 2007 http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/05/arts/05enou.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marissa Newhall, "[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/15/AR2007091501441.html Channeling Their Discontent, 500 Gather at Executive's D.C.

In a similar vein, activists protested against the BET show, ''Hot Ghetto Mess,'' which satirizes the culture of [[working-class]] [[African-Americans]]. The protests resulted in the change of the television show name to ''[[We Got to Do Better]].''&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

The [[Jim Crow Laws]] were state and local laws enacted in the [[Southern United States|Southern]] and [[Border states (Civil War)|border states]] of the [[United States]] and enforced between 1876 and 1965. They mandated "[[separate but equal]]" status for black Americans. In reality, this led to treatment and accommodations that were almost always inferior to those provided to [[white American]]s. The most important laws required that public schools, public places and public transportation, like trains and buses, have separate facilities for whites and blacks. (These Jim Crow Laws were separate from the 1800-66 [[Black Codes in the USA|Black Codes]], which had restricted the [[civil rights]] and civil liberties of African Americans.) State-sponsored school segregation was declared unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1954 in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''. Generally, the remaining Jim Crow laws were overruled by the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act]]; none were in effect at the end of the 1960s.

Segregation continued even after the demise of the Jim Crow laws. Data on house prices and attitudes toward integration from suggest that in the mid-twentieth century, segregation was a product of collective actions taken by whites to exclude blacks from their neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="vigdor"&gt;''The Rise and Decline of the American Ghetto'' David M. Cutler, Edward L. Glaeser, Jacob L. Vigdor
''The Journal of Political Economy'', Vol. 107, No. 3 (Jun., 1999), pp. 455-506&lt;/ref&gt; Segregation also took the form of [[redlining]], the practice of denying or increasing the cost of services, such as [[banking]], [[insurance]], access to jobs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.core.ucl.ac.be/services/psfiles/dp99/dp9913.pdf Racial Discrimination and Redlining in Cities]&lt;/ref&gt; access to health care,&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Race and health]]&lt;/ref&gt; or even [[supermarkets]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/ptc5hvexthe7wrye/ In poor health: Supermarket redlining and urban nutrition], Elizabeth Eisenhauer, [[GeoJournal]] Volume 53, Number 2 / February, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; to residents in certain, often racially determined,&lt;ref name="eastny"&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=TWo8OFJpFtAC How East New York Became a Ghetto] by Walter Thabit. ISBN 0814782671. Page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; areas. Although in the [[United States]] informal discrimination and segregation have always existed, the practice called "redlining" began with the [[National Housing Act of 1934]], which established the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA). The practice was fought first through passage of the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]] (which prevents redlining when the criteria for redlining are based on race, religion, gender, familial status, disability, or ethnic origin), and later through the [[Community Reinvestment Act]] of 1977, which requires banks to apply the same lending criteria in all communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0813339529 Comeback Cities: A Blueprint for Urban Neighborhood Revival] By Paul S. Grogan, Tony Proscio. ISBN 0813339529. Published 2002. Page 114.&lt;blockquote&gt;The goal was not to relax lending restrictions but rather to get banks to apply the same criteria in the inner-city as in the [[suburbs]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Although redlining is illegal some argue that it continues to exist in other forms.

===Contemporary issues===
Black-White segregation is declining fairly consistently for most metropolitan areas and cities. Despite these pervasive patterns, many changes for individual areas are small.&lt;ref&gt;''Inequality and Segregation''
R Sethi, R Somanathan - Journal of Political Economy, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty years after the civil rights era, the United States remains a residentially segregated society in which Blacks and Whites inhabit different neighborhoods of vastly different quality.&lt;ref&gt;''SEGREGATION AND STRATIFICATION: A Biosocial Perspective'' Douglas S. Massey Du Bois Review: Social Science Research on Race (2004), 1: 7-25 Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Inequality and Segregation'' Rajiv Sethi and Rohini Somanathan ''Journal of Political Economy'', volume 112 (2004), pages 1296–1321&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers suggest that racial segregation may lead to disparities in health and mortality. Thomas LaVeist (1989; 1993) tested the hypothesis that [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] would aid in explaining race differences in infant mortality rates across cities. Analyzing 176 large and midsized cities, LaVeist found support for the hypothesis. Since LaVeist's studies, segregation has received increased attention as a determinant of race disparities in mortality.&lt;ref name="lavest"&gt;..&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that mortality rates for male and female African Americans are lower in areas with lower levels of residential segregation. Mortality for male and female Whites was not associated in either direction with residential segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hart KD, Kunitz SJ, Sell RR, Mukamel DB |title=Metropolitan governance, residential segregation, and mortality among African Americans |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=434–8 |year=1998 |month=March |pmid=9518976 |pmc=1508338 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.88.3.434|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9518976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers Sharon A. Jackson, Roger T. Anderson, Norman J. Johnson and Paul D. Sorlie found that, after adjustment for family income, [[Mortality rate|mortality]] risk increased with increasing minority residential segregation among Blacks aged 25 to 44 years and non-Blacks aged 45 to 64 years. In most age/race/gender groups, the highest and lowest mortality risks occurred in the highest and lowest categories of residential segregation, respectively. These results suggest that minority residential segregation may influence mortality risk and underscore the traditional emphasis on the social underpinnings of disease and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jackson SA, Anderson RT, Johnson NJ, Sorlie PD |title=The relation of residential segregation to all-cause mortality: a study in black and white |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=615–7 |year=2000 |month=April |pmid=10754978 |pmc=1446199 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.90.4.615|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10754978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of heart disease among African Americans are associated with the segregation patterns in the neighborhoods where they live (Fang ''et al.'' 1998). Stephanie A. Bond Huie writes that neighborhoods affect health and mortality outcomes primarily in an indirect fashion through environmental factors such as smoking, diet, exercise, stress, and access to health insurance and medical providers.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/(4mofmj45dowzx445b21cbw55)/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,8,15;journal,30,40;linkingpublicationresults,1:102491,1 THE CONCEPT OF NEIGHBORHOOD IN HEALTH AND MORTALITY RESEARCH]''&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, segregation strongly influences premature mortality in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cooper RS, Kennelly JF, Durazo-Arvizu R, Oh HJ, Kaplan G, Lynch J |title=Relationship between premature mortality and socioeconomic factors in black and white populations of US metropolitan areas |journal=Public Health Rep |volume=116 |issue=5 |pages=464–73 |year=2001 |pmid=12042610 |pmc=1497360 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laws regarding race===
{{Main|Race legislation in the United States}}
{{Expand|date=October 2007}}

===Court cases regarding race===
==Institutional racism==
[[Institutional racism]] is the theory that aspects of the structure, pervasive attitudes, and established institutions of society disadvantage some racial groups, although not by an overtly discriminatory mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eraseracismny.org/html/whatis/whatis.php What is Institutional and Structural Racism?] ERASE RACISM&lt;/ref&gt; There are several factors that play into institutional racism, including but not limited to: accumulated wealth/benefits from racial groups that have benefited from past discrimination, educational and occupational disadvantages faced by non-native English speakers in the United States, ingrained stereotypical images that still remain in the society (e.g. black men are likely to be criminals).&lt;ref&gt;Bullock III, C. S. &amp; Rodgers Jr., H. R. (1976) "Institutional Racism: Prerequisites, Freezing, and Mapping". ''Phylon'' 37 (3), 212-223.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration===
Access to United States [[citizenship]] was restricted by race, beginning with the [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] which refused naturalization to "non-whites." Many in the modern United States forget the institutionalized prejudice against white followers of [[Roman Catholicism]] who immigrated from countries such as [[Ireland]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhc.rtp.nc.us/tserve/nineteen/nkeyinfo/nromcath.htm Roman Catholics and Immigration in Nineteenth-Century America] by Julie Byrne, Dept. of Religion, Duke University, National Humanities Center&lt;/ref&gt; Other efforts include the 1882 [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] and the 1924 [[National Origins Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=47 Chinese Exclusion Act (1882)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicaldocuments.com/ImmigrationActof1924.htm Immigration Act of 1924] HistoricalDocuments.com&lt;/ref&gt; The Immigration Act of 1924 was aimed at further restricting the [[Southern Europe|Southern]] and [[Eastern Europe]]ans who had begun to enter the country in large numbers beginning in the 1890s. While officially prohibited, U.S. officials continue to differentially apply laws on illegal immigration depending on national origin (essentially declining to enforce immigration laws against citizens of rich countries who overstay their visas) and personal economy (differentially awarding visas to foreign nationals based on bank accounts, properties and so on).

===Wealth creation===
Massive racial differentials in account of wealth remain in the United States: between whites and African Americans, the gap is a factor of ten.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M. Shapiro, ''The Hidden Cost of Being African American: How Wealth Perpetuates Inequality'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; An analyst of the phenomenon, Thomas Shapiro, professor of law and social policy at Brandeis University argues, “The wealth gap is not just a story of merit and achievement, it’s also a story of the historical legacy of race in the United States.”&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in AP, "[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15704759/ Census report: Broad racial disparities persist]," Nov 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Differentials applied to the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security Act]] (which excluded agricultural workers, a sector that then included most black workers), rewards to military officers, and the educational benefits offered returning soldiers after [[World War II]]. Pre-existing disparities in wealth are exacerbated by tax policies that reward investment over waged income, subsidize mortgages, and subsidize private sector developers.&lt;ref&gt;George Lipsitz, "[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-0678%28199509%2947%3A3%3C369%3ATPIIWR%3E2.0.CO%3B2-9 The Possessive Investment in Whiteness: Racialized Social Democracy and the "White" Problem in American Studies]," ''American Quarterly'', Vol. 47, No. 3. (Sep., 1995), pp. 369-387.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on health===
{{See also|Race and health}}
In the US racial differences in health and quality of life often persist even at equivalent socioeconomics levels. Individual and institutional discrimination, along with the stigma of inferiority, can adversely affect health. Residence in poor neighborhoods, racial bias in medical care, the stress of experiences of discrimination and the acceptance of the societal stigma of inferiority can have deleterious consequences for health.&lt;ref name="raceSES"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Williams DR |title=Race, socioeconomic status, and health. The added effects of racism and discrimination |journal=Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. |volume=896 |issue= |pages=173–88 |year=1999 |pmid=10681897 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb08114.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[Psychometrics of racism|The Schedule of Racist Events]] (SRE), an 18-item self-report inventory that assesses the frequency of racist discrimination. Hope Landrine and Elizabeth A. Klonoff found that racist discrimination is rampant in the lives of African Americans and is strongly related to psychiatric symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;''The Schedule of Racist Events: A Measure of Racial Discrimination and a Study of Its Negative Physical and Mental Health Consequences'' Journal of Black Psychology, Vol. 22, No. 2, 144-168 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; A study on racist events in the lives of African American women found that lifetime experiences of racism were positively related to lifetime history of both physical disease and frequency of recent common colds. These relationships were largely unaccounted for by other variables. Demographic variables such as income and education were not related to experiences of racism. The results suggest that racism can be detrimental to African American's well being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kwate NO, Valdimarsdottir HB, Guevarra JS, Bovbjerg DH |title=Experiences of racist events are associated with negative health consequences for African American women |journal=J Natl Med Assoc |volume=95 |issue=6 |pages=450–60 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=12856911 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physiological stress caused by racism has been documented in studies by [[Claude Steele]], Joshua Aronson, and Steven Spencer on what they term "[[stereotype threat]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blascovich J, Spencer SJ, Quinn D, Steele C |title=African Americans and high blood pressure: the role of stereotype threat |journal=Psychol Sci |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=225–9 |year=2001 |month=May |pmid=11437305 |doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00340 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy et al. found that both measures of collective disrespect were strongly correlated with black mortality (r = 0.53 to 0.56), as well as with white mortality (r = 0.48 to 0.54). These data suggest that racism, measured as an ecologic characteristic, is associated with higher mortality in both blacks and whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kennedy BP, Kawachi I, Lochner K, Jones C, Prothrow-Stith D |title=(Dis)respect and black mortality |journal=Ethn Dis |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=207–14 |year=1997 |pmid=9467703 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care inequality===
{{See also|Race and health}}
They are major racial differences in access to [[health care]] and in the quality of health care provided. A study published in the American Journal of Public Health estimated that: "over 886,000 deaths could have been prevented from 1991 to 2000 if African Americans had received the same care as whites." The key differences they cited were lack of insurance, inadequate [[health insurance|insurance]], poor service, and reluctance to seek care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Woolf SH, Johnson RE, Fryer GE, Rust G, Satcher D |title=The health impact of resolving racial disparities: an analysis of US mortality data |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=94 |issue=12 |pages=2078–81 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15569956 |pmc=1448594 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.94.12.2078|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15569956}}&lt;/ref&gt; A history of government-sponsored experimentation, such as the notorious [[Tuskegee Syphilis Study]] has left of legacy of African American distrust of the medical system.&lt;ref&gt;"The History of Black 'Paranoia',” ch. 3 of Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair, ''Whiteout: The CIA, Drugs, and the Press'', London: Verso, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inequalities in health care may also reflect a [[systemic bias]] in the way medical procedures and treatments are prescribed for different ethnic groups. Raj Bhopal writes that the history of [[Scientific racism|racism in science]] and medicine shows that people and institutions behave according to the ethos of their times and warns of dangers to avoid in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bhopal R |title=Spectre of racism in health and health care: lessons from history and the United States |journal=BMJ |volume=316 |issue=7149 |pages=1970–3 |year=1998 |month=June |pmid=9641943 |pmc=1113412 |doi= |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9641943}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy Krieger contended that much modern research supported the assumptions needed to justify racism.

==Affirmative action==
{{Main|Affirmative action in the United States}}
[[Affirmative action]] is a policy or program intended to promote access to education or employment for minority groups and women. Motivation for affirmative action policies is to redress the effects of past discrimination and to encourage public institutions such as universities, hospitals, and police forces to be more representative of the population.

Affirmative action programs may include targeted recruitment efforts, preferential treatment given to applicants from historically disadvantaged groups, and in some cases the use of quotas. Most American universities and some employers practice affirmative action.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Some opponents of affirmative action view the greater access by women and minority groups to be at the expense of groups considered dominant (typically white men). In their view, these policies demonstrate an overt preference for applicants from particular backgrounds over better-qualified (or equally-qualified) candidates from other backgrounds. Some opponents of affirmative action believe the only consideration in choosing between applicants should be merit. Some also criticize affirmative action because they believe it perpetuates racial division instead of minimizing the importance of race in American society.&lt;ref&gt;''Cultural whiplash: the unforeseen consequences of America's crusade against racial discrimmination'' / Patrick Garry (2006) ISBN 1581825692&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of affirmative action believe that the perceived injustice to the dominant group is not supported by facts. They point to statistics that suggest that affirmative action has not resulted in fewer opportunities for white people. For example, white enrollment in universities has increased along with minority enrollment. In 1973, 30% of white high school graduates attended universities; in 1993, after widespread implementation of affirmative action policies, that number had risen to 42%.&lt;ref name=Myths&gt;[http://www.iupui.edu/~aao/myths.html Myths and Fact about Affirmative Action&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some supporters of affirmative action point out that, even in the absence of affirmative action, college admissions rarely are purely merit-based: athletes, musicians, and [[Legacy preferences|legacy students]] (children of [[Alumnus|alumni]]) have always been given preferential treatment. For example, [[Harvard University]] admits 35-40% of legacy applicants, and a rejected white applicant is more likely to have been displaced by a legacy student than by one who benefited from affirmative action.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}
