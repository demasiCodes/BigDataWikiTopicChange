'''Racial anthropology''', pejoratively also '''scientific racism'''&lt;ref&gt;a term used from the 1960s, following [[Juan Comas]]&lt;/ref&gt;  is the use of scientific, or ostensibly&lt;ref&gt;"Ostensibly scientific": cf. Adam Kuper, Jessica Kuper (eds.), ''The social science encyclopedia'' (1996), "Racism", p. 716: "This [''sc. scientific''] racism entailed the use of 'scientific techniques', to sanction the belief in European and American racial superiority"; ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Questions to sociobiology'' (1998), "Race, theories of", p. 18: "Its exponents [''sc. of scientific racism''] tended to equate race with species and claimed that it constituted a scientific explanation of human history"; Terry Jay Ellingson, ''The myth of the noble savage'' (2001), 147ff. "In scientific racism, the racism was never very scientific; nor, it could at least be argued, was whatever met the qualifications of actual science ever very racist" (p. 151); Paul A. Erickson,Liam D. Murphy, ''A History of Anthropological Theory'' (2008), p. 152: "Scientific racism: Improper or incorrect science that actively or passively supports racism".&lt;/ref&gt; scientific, findings and [[Scientific method|method]] to investigate [[Race (classification of humans)|differences]] among the human races, specifically in a [[Historical definitions of race|historical context]] of ca. 1880 to 1930.

As a term, ''scientific racism'' denotes the contemporary and historical scientific theories that employ [[anthropology]] (notably [[physical anthropology]]), [[anthropometry]], [[craniometry]], and other disciplines, in fabricating anthropologic [[typology (anthropology)|typologies]] supporting the classification of human populations into physically discrete human races.

Racial or [[physical anthropology]] was most common during the [[New Imperialism]] period (ca. 1880s–1914), in the second half of the 19th century, wherein theory conflated with [[racial supremacism]] in justifying white European [[Empire|imperialism]].
Since the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]] (1939–45) and the occurrence of the [[Holocaust]], scientific racism in theory and action was formally denounced, especially in ''[[The Race Question]]'' (18 July 1950), the [[UNESCO]] [[Antiracism|moral condemnation of racism]] and official debunking of  scientific racism: "The myth of 'race' has created an enormous amount of human and social damage. In recent years, it has taken a heavy toll in human lives, and caused untold suffering".&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001282/128291eo.pdf The Race Question], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
Beginning in the later 20th century, scientific racism has been criticized as obsolete, and as historically used to
support or validate [[Racism|racist]] world-views, usually based upon belief in the existence and significance of racial categories — typically with a hierarchy of superior and inferior races.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Patricia Hill Collins, ''Black feminist thought: knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment'' (2nd ed., 2000), Glossary, p. 300: "Scientific racism was designed to prove the inferiority of people of color"; Simon During, ''Cultural studies: a critical introduction'' (2005), p. 163: "It [''sc. scientific racism''] became such a powerful idea because ... it helped legitimate the domination of the globe by whites"; David Brown and Clive Webb, ''Race in the American south: from slavery to civil rights'' (2007), p. 75: "...the idea of a hierarchy of races was driven by an influential, secular, scientific discourse in the second half of the eighteenth century and was rapidly disseminated during the nineteenth century".&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "scientific racism" is a pejorative adjective applied to contemporary theories, such as in ''[[The Bell Curve]]'' (1994), claiming that [[scientific evidence]] shows significant [[evolution]]ary differences among human races and [[ethnic groups]]. Critics of recent authors who have been criticized as scientific racists write that their works are motivated by racist presumptions unsupported by available evidence. Publications, such as the ''[[Mankind Quarterly]]'', founded as an explicitly race-conscious publication, have been accused of scientific racism for publishing articles on controversial interpretations of [[human evolution]], [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]], [[ethnography]], [[language]], [[mythology]], [[archaeology]], and race subjects.&lt;ref name="mankindquarterly.org"&gt;http://www.mankindquarterly.org/about.html&lt;/ref&gt; As such, "scientific racism" criticizes studies claiming to establish a connection between [[History of the race and intelligence controversy|race and intelligence]], to promote the idea of "superior" and "inferior" human races.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The funding of Scientific Racism: Wickliffe Draper and the Pioneer Fund |last=Tucker |first=William H. |authorlink=William H.

[[Image:Urville-Patagonians3.jpg|thumb|150px|left|''Homo monstrosus'' Patagonian giants: ''Voyage au pole sud et dans l'Océanie'' (''Voyage to the South Pole, and in Oceania''), by [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]]]]

In the 18th century, there appeared [[Racialism|racialist]] publications, proposing geographically-based "scientific" differences among "the races"; notably, 17th- and 18th-century interpretations of [[natural history]] excluded [[Theory of evolution|evolution]]. In the 17th century, the historian [[Henri de Boulainvilliers]] (1658&amp;ndash;1722) divided the French as two races: (i) the [[aristocracy|aristocratic]]  "French race" descended from the invader Germanic [[Franks]], and (ii) the indigenous [[Gallo-Roman]] race (the political [[Third Estate]] populace). The Frankish aristocracy dominated the Gauls by innate [[right of conquest]] — the contrary of modern [[nationalism]].

In his time, [[Henri de Boulainvilliers]], a believer in the "right of conquest", did not understand "race" as biologically immutable, but as a contemporary (racist) cultural construct; however, his racialist account of French racial history was not entirely mythical — despite "supporting" [[hagiography|hagiographies]] and [[epic poetry]], such as  ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' (''La Chanson de Roland'', ca. 12th c.) — he sought [[scientific]] legitimation, by historically basing his racialist distinction of the existence of genetically-discrete Germanic and Latin races in France; nonetheless, his fantastical, theoretic racialism was distinct from the biologic facts manipulated in 19th-century scientific racism. (cf. [[Cultural relativism]])

[[File:LinnaeusWeddingPortrait.jpg||thumb|right|125px|Carolus Linnaeus, (J. H. Scheffel, 1739)]]
[[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707–1778), the physician, botanist, and zoologist, who established the [[Taxonomy|taxonomic]] bases of [[binomial nomenclature]] for fauna and flora, was also a pioneer researcher in biologically defining "human race". In ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1767) he established five human-race taxa: (i) the ''Americanus'', (ii) the ''Asiaticus'', (iii) the ''Africanus'', (iv) the ''Europeanus'', and (v) the ''Monstrosus'', based upon geographic origin and skin color. Each race possessed innate physiognomic characteristics: the ''Americanus'' were red-skinned, of stubborn character, and angered easily; the ''Africanus'' were black-skinned, relaxed, and of negligent character; the ''Asiaticus'' race, were yellow-skinned, avaricious, and easily distracted; whereas, unlike the character-imbalanced colored people, the ''[[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeanus]]'' were white-skinned, of gentle character, inventive [[mind]], and bellicose; and the ''Monstrosus'' were mythologic human sub-races.&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, Carl. ''Systema Naturae'' (1767), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johann Friedrich Blumenbach.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Johan Friedrich Blumenbach]]
The sub-races comprised the "four-footed, mute, hairy" ''Homo feralis'' (''Feral man''), the animal-reared ''Juvenis lupinus hessensis'' (Hessian [[Feral child|wolf boy]]), the ''Juvenis hannoveranus'' ([[Peter the Wild Boy|Hannoverian boy]]), the ''Puella campanica'' ([[Marie-Angélique Memmie Le Blanc|Wild-girl of Champagne]]), and the agile, but faint-hearted ''Homo monstrosus'' (''Monstrous man'') sub-races, comprehending the [[Patagon|Patagonian giant]], the Dwarf of the Alps, and the [[monorchid]] [[Khoikhoi]] (Hottentot). Furthermore, in ''Amoenitates academicae'' (1763), Linnaeus presented the ''Homo anthropomorpha'' (''Anthropomorphic man'') race of [[mythology|mythologic]], humanoid creatures, such as the [[Troglodytae|troglodyte]], the [[satyr]], the [[Lernaean Hydra|hydra]], and the [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], incorrectly identified as [[Ape|simian]] creatures.

In the late 18th century, the ''History of Jamaica'' (1774), by [[Edward Long]], a British colonial administrator, presented a simple race classification. In ''On the Natural Varieties of Mankind'' (1775), a foundational work of scientific racism, the German physician and anthropologist [[Johann Blumenbach]] proposed [[monogenism]] — humankind had a common genetic ancestry', that the races were evolutionarily related. On the other hand, the anatomist [[Samuel Thomas von Sömmering|Samuel von Sömmering]] and the philosopher [[Christoph Meiners]] proposed [[polygenism]] — that humankind had discrete genetic ancestries: the races were evolutionarily unrelated.

A few years later, [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724&amp;ndash;1804), the celebrated symbol of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]’s philosophy of progress and [[humanism]], wrote ''On the Different Races of Man'' (''Über die verschiedenen Rassen der Menschen'', 1775), an attempted scientific classification of human races. [[Friedrich Hegel]] (1770&amp;ndash;1831) presented a strong [[unilineal evolution|evolutionist]] account of history in the ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]]'' (''Vorlesungen über die Philosophie der Weltgeschichte'', 1837) chronicling the development of the historical ''Geist'' (Spirit) through serial realisations of ''[[Volkgeist]]er'' (Folk Spirits).

Hegel's [[philosophy of history]] was explicitly biased towards Europe, especially the [[Prussia]]n state, conceived as the ultimate historical achievement, i.e. the [[End of History]]. In his chapter on the "Geographical Foundings of Universal History" Hegel said that "each People represented a particular degree of the development of the Spirit", thus forming a "nation"; however, that nationalism is not based upon racial (physical) particularities, rather it concerns the historico–geographic site where the ''Geister'' unfold. Informed by [[Montesquieu]]'s theory of climatologic influence upon cultural mores and law Hegel developed in ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748), contrasting historical peoples with ahistoric [[savage]]s:

&lt;blockquote&gt; It is true that climate has influence, in that sense that neither the warm zone, nor the cold zone, are favourable to the liberty of man, and to the apparition of historical peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Hegel]], ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]]'', 1828&amp;ndash;1830, Chapter IV, Natural Conditions&amp;mdash;The Geographical Foundings of Universal History; 1, General Definitions; A. Natural Conditioning, §5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unsurprisingly, Hegel thus favoured the ''Geist'' in temperate zones, and finally wrote an account of "[[universal history]]" chronicling the [[Orientalism|Oriental World]], the [[Classical Antiquity|Greek Antiquity]], the [[Roman Empire|Roman]], the [[Christendom|Christian World]], and the Prussian World.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, ''ibid.'', Chapter V&lt;/ref&gt; In the same ''Lectures'' he said that "America is the country of the future", yet "philosophy does not concern itself with prophecies", but with history.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, ''ibid.'', IV, 2, The [[New World]], 4 (1 is the Introduction) "North America and its Destiny," excipit&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel’s philosophy, like that of Kant, cannot be reduced to evolutionist statements, nevertheless, it justified European [[imperialism]] until the [[World War I|First World War]] (1914–18). Likewise, some of Montesquieu’s ''œuvre'' justified "scientifically-ground" Negro inferiority consequent to the climate’s influence. Moreover, this racialist and evolutionist philosophy was developed by [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (1788&amp;ndash;1860), who naturalistically attributed civilizational primacy to the white races who gained sensitivity and intelligence via the refinement consequent to living in the rigorous North climate; to wit:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient [[Hindus]] and [[Egyptians]], are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste, or race, is fairer in colour than the rest, and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the [[Brahmin]]s, the [[Inca Empire|Inca]], and the rulers of the [[Polynesia|South Sea Islands]]. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention, because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers, and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want, and misery, which, in their many forms, were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the [[parsimony]] of nature, and out of it all came their high civilization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Schopenhauer]], ''Parerga and Paralipomena: Short Philosophical Essays'', Volume II, Section 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--
In ''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity'' (2006), Benjamin Isaac reports that scientific racism is rooted in [[Greco-Roman world|Græco–Roman antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;Princeton University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Yet earlier, in ''The Human Races According to Kant'' (''Les races humaines selon Kant'', 2004), Raphaël Lagier countered said interpretation, emphasizing the very different [[scientific method]] established by modern [[biology]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Raphaël Lagier, ''Les races humaines selon Kant'', [[PUF]], 2004. ISBN 978-2-13-054657-3 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. Isaac discusses the predecessor roles of [[Hippocrates]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Galen]], in the formulations of the modern, scientific racist ''[[Weltanschauung]]'' (world-view).

The prime example of (proto) scientific racism is the 5th century BC treatise ''Airs, Waters, Places'', by Hippocrates, about which [[Pseudo-Aristotle]] notes to Hippocrates: "The idea that dark people are cowards, and light people courageous fighters, is found already in ''Airs, Waters, Places''."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Isaac, ''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity'', p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in the 1st century BC, the Roman writer, architect, and engineer, [[Vitruvius]] (70–25 BC), relying upon the racial theories of the Greek [[Stoicism|Stoic]] polymath [[Posidonius]] (ca. 135–51 BC), said: " ... those races nearest to the southern half of the axis are of lower stature, with swarthy complexions, curly hair, black eyes, and little blood, on account of the sun. This poverty of blood makes them over-timid to stand up against the sword ... On the other hand, men born in cold countries are, indeed, ready to meet the shock of arms with great courage and without timidity".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Isaac, ''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity'', p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[scientific classification]] established by Carl Linnaeus is requisite to any human racial classification scheme. In the 19th century, [[unilineal evolution]]  (aka classical social evolution) was a conflation of competing sociologic and anthropologic theories proposing that Western European culture was the acme of human socio-cultural evolution. The ideologic proposal that social status is unilinear — from primitive to civilized, from agronomic to industrial — became popular among philosophers, including [[Friedrich Hegel]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Auguste Comte]]. In said context, the Christian [[Bible]] was interpreted to sanction [[slavery]], and, from the 1820s to the 1850s, was an oft-cited, pro-slavery legalism used in the [[History of the United States (1789–1849)|antebellum]] [[Southern United States]], by writers such as the Rev. [[Richard Furman]] and [[Thomas R. Cobb]], for the ''de jure'' and ''de facto'' enforcement of the [[Racialism|racialist]] idea that negroes had been created unequal, and thus suited to slavery.&lt;ref name=drace/&gt;

[[Image:Races and skulls.png|200px|right|thumb|Indigenous Races of the Earth Before ''[[Origin of Species]]'' (1850), [[Josiah Clark Nott]] and [[George Robins Gliddon]] implied that "Negroes" were a [[Creationism|creational]] rank between "Greeks" and [[chimpanzee]]s.&lt;ref name=drace/&gt;]]

In ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853&amp;ndash;55), Arthur de Gobineau proposed three human races, and that [[miscegenation]] led to the collapse of civilization.  [[polygenism|Polygenist]] theory proposed different genetic origins of the species Man, thus making it conceptually possible to conceive different, biologically discrete, human races, and so classify people as animals are classified — without rights. In ''[[On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life]]'' (1859), by [[Charles Darwin]], proved culturally influential in assessing the place of the species Man in Nature; and in ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'' (1871) he reports no racial distinctions indicating that the human races are discrete species; to wit:

&lt;blockquote&gt; It may be doubted whether any character can be named, which is distinctive of a race and is constant . . . they graduate into each other, and . . . it is hardly possible to discover clear, distinctive characters between them . . . As it is improbable that the numerous, and unimportant, points of resemblance, between the several races of man, in bodily structure and mental faculties (I do not here refer to similar customs) should all have been independently acquired, they must have been inherited from progenitors who had these same characters. — ''The Descent of Man'' (1871) &lt;ref name=drace&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rationalrevolution.net/articles/darwin_nazism.htm |title=The Mis-portrayal of Darwin as a Racist |accessdate=2008-01-06 |last=Price |first=R.G. |coauthors= |date=June 24, 2006 |work= |publisher=rationalrevolution.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"It may be doubted whether any character can be named which is distinctive of a race and is constant... they graduate into each other, and.. it is hardly possible to discover clear distinctive characters between them...

In establishing a sole human species, Darwin contrasted the "civilized races" with the "savage races"; like most of his contemporaries — except the naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] — he did not distinguish "biological race" from "cultural race". Moreover, beyond the biology, he note that savage races risked extinction more from white European [[colonialism]], than from evolutionary inadequacy.&lt;ref name=drace/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/quotes/mine/part4.html#DarwinRaceQuotes |title=Quote Mine Project: Assorted Quotes |accessdate=2007-12-29 |author= |date= |publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive]] |pages= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1940s, the term ''[[Social Darwinism]]'' denoted ideologies, including pre-Darwinian racialism and racism, derived from facile interpretations of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]]. (cf. [[Racialism]])

At the 19th century’s end, scientific racism conflated Græco–Roman eugenicism with [[Francis Galton]]'s concept of voluntary [[eugenics]] in the form of coercive, anti-immigrant government programs influenced by other socio-political [[discourse]]s and events. Such institutional racism was effected via [[Phrenology]], telling character from physiognomy; [[craniometry|craniometric]] skull and skeleton studies; thus skulls and skeletons of black people and other colored ''volk'', were displayed between apes and white men.

In 1906, [[Ota Benga]], a [[Pygmies|Pygmy]], was displayed as the "Missing Link", in the [[Bronx Zoo]], New York City, alongside apes and animals. The most influential theorists included the anthropologist [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] (1854&amp;ndash;1936) who proposed "anthroposociology"; and [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] (1744&amp;ndash;1803), who applied "race" to [[nationalist]] theory, thereby developing the first conception of [[ethnic nationalism]]. In 1882, [[Ernest Renan]] contradicted Herder with a nationalism based upon the "will to live together", not founded upon ethnic or racial prerequisites. Scientific racist discourse posited the historical existence of "national races" such as the ''[[German people|Deutsche Volk]]'' in Germany, and the "French race" being a branch of the basal "[[Aryan race]]" extant for millennia, to advocate for [[Geo-politics|geo-political]] borders parallel to the racial ones.

=== Craniometry and physical anthropology ===
{{See|Craniometry |physical anthropology}}
[[File:Petrus-Camper-(professor).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Pieter Camper]]

The Dutch scholar [[Pieter Camper]] (1722&amp;ndash;89), an early craniometric theoretician, used "craniometry" (interior skull-volume measurement) to scientifically justify racial differences. In 1770, he conceived of the facial angle to measure intelligence among species of men. The facial angle was formed by drawing two lines: a horizontal line from nostril to ear; and a vertical line from the upper-jawbone prominence to the forehead prominence. Camper’s craniometry reported that antique statues (the Græco–Roman ideal) had a 90-degree facial angle, Europeans an 80-degree angle, Blacks a 70-degree angle, and the [[orangutan]] a 58-degree facial angle — thus he established a racist biological hierarchy for mankind, per the [[decadence|Decadent]] conception of history. Such scientific racist researches were continued by the naturalist [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] (1772&amp;ndash;1844) and the anthropologist [[Paul Broca]] (1824&amp;ndash;80).

[[Image:Gouldmismeasure.jpg|175px|thumb|''The Mismeasure of Man'', an oft-cited work critical of the theories of [[eugenics|eugenicists]] and [[phrenology|phrenologists]] (1981)]]

In the 19th century, an early [[Physical anthropology|physical anthropologist]], the American physician [[Samuel George Morton]] (1799&amp;ndash;1851), collected human skulls from worldwide, and attempted a logical, classification scheme. Influenced by contemporary racialist theory, Dr Morton said he could judge racial intellectual capacity by measuring the interior [[cranial capacity]], ergo a large skull denoted a large brain, thus high [[Intellectualism|intellectual]] capacity, conversely, a small skull denoted a small brain, thus low intellectual capacity; superior and inferior established.

The craniometric data yielded Morton the information with which to determine the point at which [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] ceased being racial Caucasians, and the point where racial [[Negro|Negro-ness]] began. The craniometry of [[Ancient Egypt]]ian skulls determined that the ancient Egyptians were white people, not black-skinned Africans. Dr Morton’s major monographs, ''Crania Americana'' (1839), ''An Inquiry into the Distinctive Characteristics of the Aboriginal Race of America'' (1844), and ''Crania Aegyptiaca'' (1844) synthesize his [[Racialism|racialist]] presumptions. In ''Crania Americana'', he reported that the mean cranial capacity of white skulls was 87 in.³ (1,425&amp;nbsp;cm³); the mean cranial capacity of black skulls was 78 in.³ (1,278&amp;nbsp;cm³); and the mean cranial capacity of Native American skulls was 82 in.³ (1,344&amp;nbsp;cm³).

In ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' (1981), the [[History of science|historian of science]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]] claimed that Samuel Morton had falsified the craniometric data, perhaps inadvertently over-packing some skulls, to so produce results that would legitimize the racist presumptions he was attempting to prove. A subsequent study by John Michael found Morton's original data to be more accurate than Gould describes, concluding that "[c]ontrary to Gould's interpretation... Morton's research was conducted with integrity."&lt;ref name="jsmichael"&gt;Michael, J. S. (1988). "A New Look at Morton's Craniological Research." ''Current Anthropology'' '''29''': 349-354.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, Paul Broca, founder of the Anthropological Society of Paris (1859), found the same pattern of measures — that ''Crania Americana'' reported — by weighing specimen brains at [[autopsy]]. Other historical studies, proposing a black race–white race, intelligence–brain size difference, include those by Bean (1906), Mall (1909), Pearl (1934), and Vint (1934).

=== Monogenism and polygenism ===
{{See|Monogenism |Polygenism}}
[[File:Josiah Clarke Nott.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Dr Josiah Clarke Nott, MD (1860s)]]

Samuel Morton’s followers, especially Dr [[Josiah C. Nott]] (1804&amp;ndash;1873) and [[George Gliddon]] (1809&amp;ndash;57) extended Dr Morton’s ideas in ''Types of Mankind'' (1854), claiming that Morton’s findings supported the notion of [[polygenism]] — mankind has discrete genetic ancestries; the races are evolutionarily unrelated, and is predecessor of the [[Multiregional origin of modern humans|modern human multiregional origin hypothesis]]. Moreover, Morton, himself, had been reluctant to espouse polygenism, because it [[Theology|theologically]] challenged the Christian [[creation myth]] espoused in the Bible.

Later, in ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' (1871), Charles Darwin proposed the [[single-origin hypothesis]], i.e.   [[monogenism]] — mankind has a common genetic ancestry, the races are related, opposing everything that [[Creationism]] and the polygenism of Nott and Gliddon proposed.



=== Typologies ===

[[Image:Ripley map of cephalic index in Europe.png|right|thumb|300px|Cephalic Index [[William Z. Ripley]]'s European cephalic index map, ''[[The Races of Europe]]'' (1899).]]

One of the first [[typology (anthropology)|typologies]] used to classify various human races was invented by [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] (1854&amp;ndash;1936), a theoretician of [[eugenics]], who published in 1899 ''L'Aryen et son rôle social'' (1899 &amp;mdash; "The [[Aryan]] and his social role"). In this book, he classified humanity into various, hierarchized races, spanning from the "Aryan white race, dolichocephalic", to the "brachycephalic" "mediocre and inert" race, best represented by the "[[Jew]]." Between these, Vacher de Lapouge identified the "''[[Nordic theory|Homo europaeus]]'' (Teutonic, Protestant, etc.), the "''[[Homo alpinus]]''" ([[Auvergne (province)|Auvergnat]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]], etc.), and finally the "''[[Homo mediterraneus]]''" ([[Naples|Neapolitan]], [[Andalusia|Andalus]], etc.) Vacher de Lapouge became one of the leading inspiration of [[Nazi]] [[anti-semitism]] and [[Nazi racial policies|Nazi racist ideology]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Pierre-André Taguieff]], ''La couleur et le sang &amp;mdash; Doctrines racistes à la française'' ("Colour and Blood &amp;mdash; Racist doctrines ''à la française''"), Paris, [[Mille et une nuits]], 2002, 203 pages, and ''La Force du préjugé &amp;mdash; Essai sur le racisme et ses doubles'', Tel [[Gallimard]], La Découverte, 1987, 644 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

Vacher de Lapouge's classification was mirrored in [[William Z. Ripley]] in ''[[The Races of Europe]]'' (1899), a book which had a large influence on American [[white supremacism]]. Ripley even made a map of Europe according to the alleged [[cephalic index]] of its inhabitants. He was an important influence of the American eugenist [[Madison Grant]].

Furthermore, according to John Efron of [[Indiana University]], the late 19th century also witnessed "the scientizing of [[anti-Semitism|anti-Jewish prejudice]]," stigmatizing Jews with male [[menstruation]], [[Histrionic personality disorder|pathological hysteria]], and [[nymphomania]].&lt;ref name=Efron&gt;John M.

[[Image:Joseph Deniker.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Joseph Deniker]]

[[Joseph Deniker]] (1852&amp;ndash;1918) was one of [[William Z. Ripley]]’s principal opponents; whereas Ripley maintained, as did Vacher de Lapouge, that the European populace comprised three races, Joseph Deniker proposed that the European populace comprised ten races (six primary and four sub-races). Furthermore, he proposed that the concept of "race" was ambiguous, and in its stead proposed the compound word "[[ethnic group]]", which later prominently featured in the works of [[Julian Huxley]] and [[Alfred C. Haddon]]. Moreover, Ripley argued that Deniker’s "race" idea should be denoted a "type", because it was less biologically rigid than most racial classifications.

==Ideological applications==
===Nordicism===
[[File:Madison Grant.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Madison Grant, creator of ''The Nordic race'' term.]]
Joseph Deniker’s historic contribution to racial theory was '''''la race nordique''''' (the [[Nordic race]]), a generic, racial-stock descriptor, which the American [[eugenics|eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]] (1865&amp;ndash;1937) presented as the white racial engine of world civilization. Having adopted Ripley’s three-race European populace model, but disliking the "Teuton" race name, he transliterated ''la race nordique'' into "The Nordic race", the acme of the concocted racial hierarchy, based upon his racial classification theory, popular in the 1910s and 1920s.

===USA: slavery justified===

[[Image:Morton drawing.png|right|thumb|200px|Racialist differences: "a Negro head . . . a Caucasian skull . . . a Mongol head", [[Samuel George Morton]], 1839.]]

In the United States, scientific racism justified Black African slavery to assuage moral opposition to the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. [[Alexander Thomas]] and [[Samuell Sillen]] described black men as uniquely fitted for bondage, because of their "primitive psychological organization".&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Thomas]] and [[Samuell Sillen]] (1972). ''Racism and Psychiatry''. New York: Carol Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1851, in antebellum Louisiana, the physician [[Samuel A. Cartwright]] (1793&amp;ndash;1863), considered slave escape attempts as "[[drapetomania]]", a treatable [[mental illness]], that "with proper medical advice, strictly followed, this troublesome practice that many Negroes have of running away can be almost entirely prevented". The term ''drapetomania'' (mania of the runaway slave) derives from the Greek δραπετης (drapetes, "a runaway [slave]") + μανια (mania, "madness, frenzy")&lt;ref&gt;Samual A. Cartwright, [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4h3106t.html "Diseases and Peculiarities of the Negro Race"], ''[[DeBow's Review]]—Southern and Western States'', Volume XI, New Orleans, 1851&lt;/ref&gt; Cartwright also described ''[[dysaethesia aethiopica]]'', called "rascality" by overseers. By 1840, the political challenges to American slavery increased; yet the 1840 census indicated that Northern, free blacks suffered mental illness at higher rates than did their Southern, enslaved counterparts. Moreover, Southern slavers concluded that escaping Negroes were only suffering from "mental disorders", and the census mental health data became a political weapon against [[Abolitionism|abolitionists]].&lt;ref name="Higgins, 1994"&gt;Higgins, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the [[American Civil War]] (1861–65), the matter of [[miscegenation]] prompted studies of ostensible physiological differences between [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] and [[Negro]]es. Early [[anthropology|anthropologists]], such as [[Josiah Clark Nott]], [[George Robins Gliddon]], [[Robert Knox]], and [[Samuel George Morton]], aimed to scientifically prove that Negroes were a human species different from the [[white people]] species; that the rulers of [[Ancient Egypt]] were not [[Africa]]n; and that mixed-race offspring (the product of miscegenation) tended to physical weakness and infertility. After the Civil War, Southern (Confederacy) physicians wrote textbooks of scientific racism based upon studies claiming that Black freemen (ex-slaves) were becoming extinct, because they were inadequatee to the demands of being a free man — implying that Black people benefitted from enslavement.
In 1850 Louis Agassiz commissioned a series of daguerreotypes of slaves of Columbia South Carolina for studying of races; four portraits are available at:&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Agassiz_Zealy_slave_portraits]&lt;/ref&gt;

===South African Apartheid===
{{See also|Carnegie Commission on the Poor White Problem in South Africa}}
Scientific racism played a role in establishing [[Apartheid]] in [[South Africa]]. In South Africa, white scientists, like Dudly Kidd, who published ''The essential Kafir'' in 1904, sought to "understand the African mind." They believed that the cultural differences between whites and blacks in South Africa might be caused by physiological differences in the brain. Rather than suggesting that Africans were "overgrown children," as early white explorers had, Kidd believed that Africans were "misgrown with a vengeance." He described Africans as at once "hopelessly deficient," yet "very shrewd."&lt;ref name="Dubow"&gt;Scientific Racism in Modern South Africa By Saul Dubow. 1995. ISBN 0-521-47907-X&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Carnegie Commission on the Poor White Problem in South Africa]] played a key role in establishing Apartheid in South Africa. According to one memorandum sent to Frederick Keppel, then president of the [[Carnegie Corporation]], there was "little doubt that if the natives were given full economic opportunity, the more competent among them would soon outstrip the less competent whites".&lt;ref name="swar"&gt;''The Silent War: Imperialism and the Changing Perception of Race'' By Frank Füredi. Pages 66&amp;ndash;67. ISBN 0-8135-2612-4&lt;/ref&gt;  Keppel's support for the project of creating the report was motivated by his concern with the maintenance of existing racial boundaries.&lt;ref name="swar"/&gt;  The preoccupation of the Carnegie Corporation with the so-called poor white problem in South Africa was at least in part the outcome of similar misgivings about the state of poor whites in the American South.&lt;ref name="swar"/&gt;

The report was five volumes in length.&lt;ref name="amcentry"&gt;''The American Century: Consensus and Coercion in the Projection of American Power'' By David Slater and Peter James Taylor. Page 290. ISBN 0-631-21222-1 1999&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the century, white Americans, and whites elsewhere in the world, felt uneasy because poverty and economic depression seemed to strike people regardless of race.&lt;ref name="amcentry"/&gt; White poverty contradicted notions of racial superiority, and hence it became the focus of "scientific" study.

Though the ground work for Apartheid began earlier, the report provided support for this central idea of black inferiority. This was used to justify [[racial segregation]] and discrimination&lt;ref&gt;''[http://lis.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/18/1/23 Racially segregated school libraries in KwaZulu/Natal, South Africa]'' by Jennifer Verbeek. Journal of Librarianship and Information Science, Vol. 18, No. 1, 23&amp;ndash;46 (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; in the following decades.&lt;ref name="haunted"&gt;''Haunted by Empire: Geographies of Intimacy in North American History'' By Ann Laura Stoler. Page 66. ISBN 0-8223-3724-X&lt;/ref&gt; The report expressed fear about the loss of white racial pride, and in particular pointed to the danger that the poor white would not be able to resist the process of "Africanisation".&lt;ref name="swar"/&gt;

Although scientific racism played a role in justifying and supporting [[institutional racism]] in South Africa, it was not as important in South Africa as it has been in Europe and the United States. This was due in part to the "poor white problem", which raised serious questions for supremacists about white racial superiority.&lt;ref name="Dubow"/&gt; Since poor whites were found to be in the same situation as natives in the African environment, the idea that intrinsic white superiority could overcome any environment did not seem to hold. As such, scientific justifications for racism were not as useful in South Africa.&lt;ref name="Dubow"/&gt;

=== Eugenics ===
{{See|Eugenics}}
[[Stephen Jay Gould]] described [[Madison Grant]]'s ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' (1916) as "the most influential tract of American scientific racism." In the 1920s&amp;ndash;30s, the German [[racial hygiene]] movement embraced Grant's [[Nordic theory]]. [[Alfred Ploetz]] (1860&amp;ndash;1940) coined the term ''Rassenhygiene'' in ''Racial Hygiene Basics'' (1895), and founded the [[German Society for Racial Hygiene]] in 1905. The movement advocated [[selective breeding]], [[compulsory sterilization]], and a close alignment of [[public health]] with [[eugenics]].

Racial hygiene was historically tied to traditional notions of [[public health]], but with emphasis on [[heredity]] &amp;mdash; what philosopher and historian [[Michel Foucault]] has called [[state racism]]. In 1869, [[Francis Galton]] (1822&amp;ndash;1911) proposed the first social measures meant to preserve or enhance biological characteristics, and later coined the term "eugenics". Galton, a [[statistics|statistician]], introduced [[correlation]] and [[regression analysis]] and discovered [[regression toward the mean]]. He was also the first to study human differences and [[inheritance of intelligence]] with statistical methods. He introduced the use of [[questionnaires]] and [[Statistical survey|survey]]s to collect data on [[population]] sets, which he needed for genealogical and biographical works and for [[anthropometrics|anthropometric]] studies. Galton also founded [[psychometrics]], the science of measuring mental faculties, and [[differential psychology]], a branch of psychology concerned with psychological differences between people rather than common traits.

Like scientific racism, eugenics grew popular in the early 20th century, and both ideas influenced [[Nazi racial policies]] and [[Nazi eugenics]]. In 1901, Galton, [[Karl Pearson]] (1857&amp;ndash;1936) and [[Walter Frank Raphael Weldon|Walter F. R. Weldon]] (1860&amp;ndash;1906) founded the ''[[Biometrika]]'' scientific journal, which promoted [[biometrics]] and statistical analysis of [[heredity]]. [[Charles Davenport]] (1866&amp;ndash;1944) was briefly involved in the review. In ''Race Crossing in Jamaica'' (1929), he made statistical arguments that biological and cultural degradation followed white and black [[miscegenation|interbreeding]]. Davenport was connected to [[Nazi Germany]] before and during [[World War II]]. In 1939 he wrote a contribution to the ''festschrift'' for [[Otto Reche]] (1879&amp;ndash;1966), who became an important figure within the plan to remove populations considered "inferior" from eastern Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhl, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Popular racist ideology ===
{{Off-topic|date=July 2010}}
{{See|Human zoo}}
[[Image:Baartman.jpg|thumbnail|right|240px|A caricature of [[Saartjie Baartman]], called the ''Hottentot Venus''. Born to a [[Khoisan]] family, she was displayed in London in the early 19th century that sparked the indignation of the African Association. She was examined by French anatomist [[Georges Cuvier]] and then died in 1815. Her remains were conserved until 1974 at the ''[[Musée de l'Homme]]'' and have since been returned to South Africa on [[Nelson Mandela]]'s request. ]]
[[Human zoo]]s, sometimes called "[[ethnographic]] exhibitions" or "Negro villages," were objects of [[anthropology]] and [[anthropometry]] and also an important means of bolstering "popular racism." Human zoos were popular from the 1870s until World War II, and the concept survived into the 21st century. Ethnographic zoos were often predicated on [[Unilineal evolution|unilinealism]] and a version of [[Social Darwinism]]. Many placed [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous people]] (particularly Africans) in a continuum between Europeans and the non-human [[hominid]]s.

Fundamental to scientific racism, unilinealism claimed [[Western culture]] was the contemporary pinnacle of [[social evolution]]. It was upheld by famous thinkers such as [[Auguste Comte]] (1798&amp;ndash;1857), [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] (1832&amp;ndash;1917), [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] (1818&amp;ndash;1881), and [[Herbert Spencer]] (1820&amp;ndash;1903). [[Social evolutionism]] attempted to scientifically formalize social thinking, and was later influenced by the [[Evolution|biological theory of evolution]].

Displaying human beings in cages to demonstrate scientific racist theories was common in the second half of the 19th century. The [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 World Fair]] in Paris had as major attraction a "Negro village" where 400 indigenous people were displayed. [[Carl Hagenbeck]], a German merchant in wild animals, exhibited in 1874 [[Samoans]] and [[Sami people]] described as "purely natural" populations. Two years later, he sent an emissary to [[Sudan]] to capture wild beasts for his [[circus]] attractions, along with [[Nubian]]s. Geoffroy de Saint-Hilaire, son of Edouard Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and owner of the Parisian ''Jardin d'acclimatation'', presented Nubians and [[Inuit]] in 1877.

In 1906, [[Madison Grant]], head of the [[Bronx Zoo|New York Zoological Society]], had [[Pygmy|Congolese pygmy]] [[Ota Benga]] displayed at the [[Bronx Zoo]] in New York City alongside [[ape]]s and other animals. At the behest of Grant, a prominent [[eugenics|eugenicist]], the zoo director placed Ota Benga in a cage with an orangutan and labeled him ''The Missing Link'', illustrating that in evolutionary terms Africans like Ota Benga were closer to apes than were Europeans. Historians Pascal Blanchard ''et al.'' said:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Human zoos, the incredible symbols of the [[Colonialism|colonial]] period, and the transition from the nineteenth to the twentieth century, have been completely suppressed in our collective history and memory. Yet they were major social events. The French, Europeans, and Americans came in their tens of millions to discover the "[[Noble savage|savage]]" for the first time in zoos or "[[ethnography|ethnographic]]" and colonial fairs. These exhibitions of the exotic (the future "native") laid the foundations on which, over an almost sixty-year period, was spun the West’s progressive transition from a "scientific" racism to a colonial and "mass" racism affecting millions of "visitors", from Paris to Hamburg, London to New York, Moscow to Barcelona. . . .&lt;ref&gt;**{{cite news | title=Le retour des zoos humains (par Pascal Blanchard et Olivier Barlet) | publisher=Africacultures |date=October 28, 2005 | url=http://www.africultures.com/index.asp?menu=affiche_article&amp;no=3920}};**{{cite news | title=From human zoos to colonial apotheoses: the era of exhibiting the Other by Pascal Blanchard, Nicolas Bancel and Sandrine Lemaire (English version) | publisher=Africacultures |date=October 28, 2005 | url=http://www.africultures.com/anglais/articles_anglais/43blanchard.htm}};**[http://www.derbraunemob.info/deutsch/index.htm Black Deutschland, von Oliver Hardt]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Interbellum to World War II==
Scientific racism continued through the early twentieth century, and soon [[intelligence testing]] became a new source for racial comparisons.  Before the [[World War II|Second World War]] (1939–45), scientific racism remained common to [[anthropology]], leading to programs of [[eugenics]], [[compulsory sterilization]], [[anti-miscegenation laws]], and [[immigration law|immigration restriction]]s in Europe and the United States. The [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] of [[Nazi Germany]] (1933–45), discredited scientific racism in academia — but racist legislation based upon it remained in some countries until the late 1960s.

===Nazi Germany===
{{Main|Racial policy of Nazi Germany}}
The [[Nazi Party]] and its sympathizers published many books on scientific racism, seizing on the eugenic and [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] ideas with which they would later become associated, although these ideas had been in circulation since the 19th century. Books such as ''Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes'' ("Ethnology of the German People") by [[Hans F. K. Günther]] and ''Rasse und Seele'' ("Race and Soul") by Dr. [[Ludwig Ferdinand Clauss]] attempted to scientifically identify differences between the [[Germans|German]], [[Nordic theory|Nordic]], or [[Aryan]] people and other, supposedly inferior, groups. German schools used these books as texts during the Nazi era.

&lt;/center&gt;

In the early 1930s, the Nazis used [[racialized]] scientific rhetoric based on [[social Darwinism]] to push its restrictive and discriminatory social policies. During [[World War II]], Nazi racialist beliefs became anathema in the United States, and Boasians such as [[Ruth Benedict]] consolidated their institutional power. After the war, discovery of [[the Holocaust]] and Nazi abuses of scientific research (such as [[Josef Mengele]]'s ethical violations and other [[war crime]]s revealed at the [[Nuremberg Trials]]) led most of the scientific community to repudiate scientific support for racism.

===United States===
In the US, eugenicists such as [[Harry H. Laughlin]], and [[Madison Grant]] sought to "scientifically" prove the physical and mental inadequacy of certain ethnic groups to justify [[compulsory sterilization]] and restrict immigration, per the [[Immigration Act of 1924]]; compulsory sterilization continued until the 1960s and later.

[[Lothrop Stoddard]] published many racialist books on what he saw as the peril of immigration, his most famous being The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy in 1920. In this book he presented a view of the world situation pertaining to race focusing concern on the coming population explosion among the "colored" peoples of the world and the way in which "white world-supremacy" was being lessened in the wake of World War I and the collapse of colonialism.

Stoddard's analysis divided world politics and situations in to "white," "yellow," "black," "Amerindian," and "brown" peoples and their interactions.Stoddard argued race and heredity were the guiding factors of history and civilization, and that the elimination or absorption of the "white" race by "colored" races would result in the destruction of Western civilization. Like Madison Grant (see The Passing of the Great Race), Stoddard divided the white race into three main divisions: Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean. He considered all three to be of good stock, and far above the quality of the colored races, but argued that the Nordic was the greatest of the three and needed to be preserved by way of eugenics. Unlike Grant, Stoddard was less concerned with which varieties of European people were superior to others (Nordic theory), but was more concerned with what he called "bi-racialism," seeing the world as being composed of simply "colored" and "white" races. In the years after the Great Migration and World War I, Grant's racial theory would fall out of favor in the U.S. in favor of a model closer to Stoddard's.

An influential publication was ''[[The Races of Europe]]'' (1939) by [[Carleton S. Coon]], president of the [[American Association of Physical Anthropologists]] from 1930 to 1961. Coon was a proponent of [[Multiregional origin of modern humans]]. He divided ''Homo sapiens'' into five main races:

{{Carleton S. Coon Racial Definitions}}
Coon's school of thought was the object of increasing opposition in mainstream anthropology after World War II. [[Ashley Montagu]]
was particularly vocal in denouncing Coon, especially in his ''Man’s Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race''. By the 1960s, Coon's approach had been rendered obsolete in mainstream anthropology, but his system continued to appear in publications by his student  [[John Lawrence Angel]] as late as in the 1970s.


{{See also|Racial segregation in the United States}}

In the late 19th century, the ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896) [[United States Supreme Court]] decision that upheld the constitutional legality of [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]], under the doctrine of "[[separate but equal]]" was intellectually rooted in the scientific racism of the era, like-wise popular support for it.&lt;ref name="rlac"&gt;''Race, Law, and Culture: Reflections on Brown v. Board of Education'' By Austin Sarat. Page 55 and 59. 1997. ISBN 0-19-510622-9&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the mid 20th century, the Supreme Court's ''[[Brown v. Board of Education|Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka]]'' (1954) decision rejected [[Racialism|racialist]] arguments about the "need" for racial segregation — especially in [[Public education|public schools]].

==After 1945==
By 1954, 58 years after the ''Plessy v. Ferguson'' upholding of racial segregation in the United States,  American popular and scholarly opinions of scientific racism and its sociologic practice, had evolved.&lt;ref name="rlac"/&gt; Subsequent to the Supreme Court’s desegregation of American public schooling, in 1960 there appeared the ''[[Mankind Quarterly]]'' journal as a venue for scientific racism. It is criticized for extremist [[right-wing politics]], [[Anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] bent, and espousing academic [[hereditarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Arvidsson, Stefan (2006), ''Aryan Idols: Indo-European Mythology as Ideology and Science'', translated by Sonia Wichmann, Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was founded in 1960, partly in response to the socially liberal ''Brown v. Board of Education'' legal decision.&lt;ref&gt;"'Scientific’ Racism Again?': Reginald Gates, the Mankind Quarterly and the Question of 'Race' in Science after the Second World War," ''Journal of American Studies'' (2007), 41: 253&amp;ndash;278 Cambridge University Press by Gavin Schaffer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jackson"&gt;''Science for Segregation: Race, Law, and the Case Against Brown v. Board of Education''. By John P. Jackson. ISBN 0-8147-4271-8 Page 148&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1966, [[Alex Haley]] interviewed [[American Nazi Party]] founder [[George Lincoln Rockwell]] for ''[[Playboy]]''. Rockwell explained why he believed blacks were inferior to whites, citing a study by G.O. Ferguson that showed black people who were part white outperformed "pure-black [[nigger]]s" (Rockwell's words) on a test. Rockwell's use of these statistics is a textbook example of a [[statistical fallacy]] used to propagate scientific racism.&lt;ref&gt;The statistics used in the study and the excerpt from the ''Playboy'' article were used as an example of a "statistical fallacy" in the book ''Flaws and Fallacies in Statistical Thinking'' by Stephen K. Campbell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the United States [[Civil Rights Movement]], many scientists who previously studied racial differences moved to other fields. For example, [[Robert Yerkes]], who previously worked on the World War I Army intelligence testing, moved to the field of [[primatology]].

International bodies such as [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] attempted to draft resolutions that would summarize the state of scientific knowledge about race and issued calls for the resolution of racial conflicts. In its 1950 ''The Race Question'', UNESCO declared that "A race, from the biological standpoint, may therefore be defined as one of the group of populations constituting the species Homo sapiens", which were broadly defined as the [[Mongoloid]], [[Negroid]], and the [[Caucasoid]] "divisions"  but stated that "It is now generally recognized that intelligence tests do not in themselves enable us to differentiate safely between what is due to innate capacity and what is the result of environmental influences, training and education."[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001282/128291eo.pdf] To this day, the statement is controversial among some scientists who disagreed with its accuracy (such as [[R. A. Fisher]]), or its purpose (as a political declaration of scientific consensus).

In 1978, the ''UNESCO Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice'' proclaimed no race was superior to any other, but, in contrast to the 1950 statement, relied more on "moral and ethical principles of humanity" rather than science.&lt;ref&gt;http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13161&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding 2001
statement by UNESCO, ''Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity'' does not mention race at all, and does not justify its views on cultural diversity with science.&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001271/127160m.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Views, or at least the language, of racial discourse, have clearly evolved over the half-century.

In 2007, [[James D. Watson|James Watson]], pioneer of [[DNA]], was criticized after being quoted as saying that Africans were of different intelligence from other races.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/fury-at-dna-pioneers-theory-africans-are-less-intelligent-than-westerners-394898.html Fury at DNA pioneer's theory: Africans are less intelligent than Westerners &amp;mdash; The Independent]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the term "scientific racism" is used to refer to research seeming to scientifically justify racist ideology. The accusation of scientific racism often is cast upon researchers claiming the existence of quantifiable differences in intelligence among the human races, especially if said differences are partly genetic in origin. Contemporary researchers include [[Arthur Jensen]] (''[[The g Factor|The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability]]''); [[J. Philippe Rushton]], president of the [[Pioneer Fund]] (''[[Race, Evolution, and Behavior]]''); [[Chris Brand]] (''[[The g Factor: General Intelligence and Its Implications]]''); [[Richard Lynn]] (''[[IQ and the Wealth of Nations]]''); [[Charles Murray (author)|Charles Murray]]; and [[Richard Herrnstein]] (''[[The Bell Curve]]''), among others.&lt;ref name="critical"&gt;''Critical Social Issues in American Education'' By H.
