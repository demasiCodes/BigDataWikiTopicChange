==Muslim world==
Religious segregation occurs in  the Muslim world, where some nations deny non-[[Islam|Muslims]], including [[Jew]]s and [[Christian]]s along with Roman Catholics, some of the civil rights and voting privileges they grant to Muslims. Many Muslim countries consign non-Muslim [[monotheism|monotheists]] to the status of [[dhimmi]]s, both officially and by custom. Saudi Arabia in particular is notorious for very stringent religious laws banning the practice of non-Muslim religions, even prescribing imprisonment and the [[death penalty]] for attempting to convert Muslims to other religions.

==[[Northern Ireland]]==

Many [[Ireland|Irish]] [[nationalist]]s and [[Republicanism|republicans]] have described Northern Ireland as being a [[gerrymander]]ed or even [[apartheid]] state, on the grounds that it was created to ensure a built-in [[Protestant]] majority, resulting in discrimination against [[Catholic]]s in government, [[education]], housing and employment. One legacy of this has been that most state schools in Northern Ireland are either Protestant or Catholic, although there now also a number of integrated schools. This has often exacerbated religious, political and cultural differences between the two communities. 

Between [[1922]] and [[1972]], Northern Ireland was governed by the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], which was Protestant-dominated, while at local government level, electoral boundaries were devised to create Protestant majorities. The outbreak of the [[The Troubles|Troubles]] led to the imposition of direct rule by the [[United Kingdom|British government]], which has since sought to introduce power sharing between [[Unionism (Ireland)|unionists]] and nationalists.
