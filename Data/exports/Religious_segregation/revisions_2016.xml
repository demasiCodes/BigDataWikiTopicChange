The similar term '''religious apartheid''' has also been used for situations where people are separated based on religion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/septemberweb-only/26.0b.html|title=Pakistan's Christians Demand End to 'Religious Apartheid' at Polls|work=Christianity Today|last=Akkaro|first=Anta|accessdate=2008-08-18|date=2000-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; including sociological phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Religion In Schools|url=http://www.teachers.tv/video/24057|series=The Big Debate|airdate=2008-01-29|minutes=0:09:29 and 0:11:52}}, in which Rabbi Dr Jonathan Romain says (at 0:09:29): "If you have separate Jewish, Catholic, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu schools, essentially you’re segregating children, you’re separating children" and (at 0:11:52): "It’s a religious apartheid society we’re creating."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Northern Ireland ==
In 2012 ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' reported that {{quote|The number of "[[peacewalls]]," physical barriers separating Catholic and Protestant communities, has increased sharply since the first ceasefires in 1994. Most people in the region cannot envisage the barriers being removed, according to a recent survey conducted by the University of Ulster. In housing and education, Northern Ireland remains one of the most segregated tracts of land anywhere on the planet -- less than one in 10 children attends a school that is integrated between Catholics and Protestant. This figure has remained stubbornly low despite the cessation of violence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/12/20/return_of_the_troubles&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Bosnia and Herzegovina==

[[Jonathan Steele]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' has argued that [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is "a dependent, stifled, apartheid regime". In his view, the [[United Nations|U.N.]] control of Bosnia under the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which he described as "UN-sanctioned liberal imperialism", creates "dependency, stifles civil society, and produces a highly visible financial apartheid in which an international salariat lords it over a war-wounded and jobless local population."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Steele|Steele, Jonathan]].

==Iran==
[[Shi'a Islam]] has been the [[state religion]] of [[Iran]] since the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979. While [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Zoroastrianism]] are officially recognized and legally protected religious minorities, they are not allowed to evangelize or allow Muslim Iranians to convert to their faiths. The U.S. [[United States Department of State|State Department]] has claimed that religious minorities have been subject to harassment and persecution.&lt;ref name=2006Report&gt;

Pakistan is officially an Islamic country and defines who and who is not a Muslim. Under these conditions, [[Ahmadi Muslims]] are declared non-Muslim by law of the land and cannot practice their faith freely. They are not permitted to call their mosques as mosques, or meet with people with the Islamic [[As-salamu alaykum|greeting of Peace]].

==Nepal==
On the banks of the [[Bagmati River]] in [[Kathmandu]], Nepal is a [[Pashupatinath Temple]] dedicated to [[Pashupati|Pashupatinath]]. This temple complex which is on the [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]]'s list since 1979 was erected anew in the 15th century by King kirat Yalamber.

Entry into the inner courtyard is strictly monitored by the temple security, which is selective of who is allowed inside. Practicing Hindus and Buddhists of Indian and Tibetan descendant are only allowed into temple courtyard. Practicing Hindus of western descent are not allowed into the temple complex along with other non Hindu visitors. Others can look at the main temple from adjacent side of the river.

==India==
The debate over the ban on non-Hindus entering Hindu temples began around 30 years ago when singer Yesudas, who planned to take part in a music programme, was stopped at the Guruvayur temple gate. He finally had to sing bhajans outside the temple wall. Though several temples in Kerala have signs saying that non-Hindus are denied entry, few of them enforce it as strictly as the Guruvayur temple, which insists on following its distinct traditions.'Only Orthodox Hindus are allowed’, reads a signboard hanging from the Lion's Gate of the Sri Jagannath Temple in Puri. The issue has triggered many a controversy in the past and continues to arouse strong feelings even today.

The temple is an important pilgrimage destination for many Hindu traditions and part of the Char Dham pilgrimages that a Hindu is expected to make in one's lifetime.

In the past a number of dignitaries, including former prime minister Indira Gandhi, had not been allowed to enter the 12th century shrine because she had married a Parsi, Feroze Gandhi. In 2005, the Queen of Thailand Mahachakri Siridharan was not allowed inside the temple as she was a follower of Buddhism.

In 2006, the shrine did not allow a citizen of Switzerland named Elizabeth Jigler, who had donated Rs. 1.78 crore to the temple because she was a Christian.
Kashi Vishvanath In Varanasi
Located in Varanasi, the temple stands on the western bank of the holy river Ganga, and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest of Shiva temples. The most famous of the many temples in Varanasi is the one dedicated to Vishveswara -- Shiva as lord of the universe. The gleaming gold spires give it the name, Golden Temple.

Non-Hindus are not allowed inside the temple, although this is not always enforced. On the northern side of Vishwanath Temple is the Gyan Kupor well. Non-Hindus are strictly not allowed to enter here.

{{main|2012 Rakhine State riots}}

The 2012 Rakhine State riots are a series of ongoing conflicts between Rohingya Muslims and ethnic Rakhine in northern [[Rakhine State]], [[Myanmar]]. The riots came after weeks of sectarian disputes and have been condemned by most people on both sides of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/08/us-myanmar-violence-idUSBRE85714E20120608 | title=Four killed as Rohingya Muslims riot in Myanmar: government | agency=Reuters | date=8 June 2012 | accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The immediate cause of the riots is unclear, with many commentators citing the killing of ten Burmese Muslims by ethnic Rakhine after the rape and murder of a Rakhine woman as the main cause.&lt;ref name=PhilInquirer&gt;{{cite news|last=Lauras|first=Didier|title=Myanmar stung by global censure over unrest|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/271174/myanmar-stung-by-global-censure-over-unrest|accessdate=15 September 2012|newspaper=Agence France-Presse in the Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whole villages have been "decimated".&lt;ref name=PhilInquirer /&gt;  Over three hundred houses and a number of public buildings have been razed. According to Tun Khin, the President of the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK (BROUK), as of 28 June 650 Rohingyas have been killed, 1,200 are missing, and more than 80,000 have been displaced.&lt;ref name="dvb_hindstorm"/&gt; According to the Myanmar authorities, the violence, between ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims, left 78 people dead, 87 injured, and thousands of homes destroyed. It also displaced more than 52,000 people.&lt;ref name="UN News"&gt;{{cite news|title=UN refugee agency redeploys staff to address humanitarian needs in Myanmar|work=UN News|date=29 June 2012|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=42356|accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government has responded by imposing curfews and by deploying troops in the region. On 10 June 2012, a [[state of emergency]] was declared in Rakhine, allowing the military to participate in the administration of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://burma.irrawaddy.org/archives/11901 | title=အေရးေပၚအေျခအေန ေၾကညာခ်က္ ႏုိင္ငံေရးသမားမ်ား ေထာက္ခံ | publisher=The Irrawaddy | date=11 June 2012 | accessdate=11 June 2012 | author=Linn Htet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first = Fergal | last = Keane | authorlink = Fergal Keane | title = Old tensions bubble in Burma | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18402678 | publisher = BBC News | date = 11 June 2012 | accessdate = 2012-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Burmese army and police have been accused of targeting Rohingya Muslims through mass arrests and arbitrary violence.&lt;ref name="dvb_hindstorm"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hindstorm|first=Hanna|title=Burmese authorities targeting Rohingyas, UK parliament told|url=http://www.dvb.no/news/burmese-authorities-targeting-rohingyas-uk-parliament-told/22676|accessdate=9 July 2012|date=28 June 2012|agency=[[Democratic Voice of Burma]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="presstv"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2012/07/13/250651/un-focuses-on-myanmar-amid-muslim-plight/ |title=UN focuses on Myanmar amid Muslim plight |date=13 July 2012 |agency=PressTV |accessdate=13 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717012101/http://www.presstv.ir:80/detail/2012/07/13/250651/un%2Dfocuses%2Don%2Dmyanmar%2Damid%2Dmuslim%2Dplight/ |archivedate=17 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of monks' organisations that played a vital role in Burma's struggle for democracy have taken measures to block any humanitarian assistance to the Rohingya community.&lt;ref name="ti_hindstorm"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hindstorm|first=Hanna|title=Burma's monks call for Muslim community to be shunned|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/burmas-monks-call-for-muslim-community-to-be-shunned-7973317.html|accessdate=25 July 2012|date=25 July 2012|work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 2012, the Myanmar Government did not include the Rohingya minority group–-classified as [[Statelessness|stateless]] Bengali Muslims from Bangladesh since 1982—on the government's list of more than 130 ethnic races and therefore the government says that they have no claim to Myanmar citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article3703383.ece|title= Rohingyas are not citizens: Myanmar minister| date= 1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Amnesty International]], the Muslim [[Rohingya people]] have continued to suffer from [[human rights]] violations under the Burmese [[Military dictatorship|junta]] since 1978, and many have fled to neighbouring [[Bangladesh]] as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18921960] [http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/myanmar-rohingya-abuses-show-human-rights-progress-backtracking-2012-07-19] [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8605669.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2005, the UNHCR ([[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]]) had been assisting with the repatriation of Rohingya from Bangladesh, but allegations of human rights abuses in the refugee camps have threatened this effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite earlier efforts by the UN, the vast majority of Rohingya refugees have remained in Bangladesh, unable to return because of the regime in Myanmar. Now they face problems in Bangladesh where they do not receive support from the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7019882.stm Burmese exiles in desperate conditions]&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009, many Rohingya refugees were helped by [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]] [[sailor]]s in the [[Strait of Malacca]], after 21 days at sea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epaper.kompas.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years thousands of Rohingya also have fled to Thailand. There are roughly 111,000 refugees housed in nine camps along the Thai-Myanmar border. There have been charges that groups of them have been shipped and towed out to open sea from Thailand, and left there. In February 2009, there was evidence of the Thai army towing a boatload of 190 Rohingya refugees out to sea. A group of refugees rescued by Indonesian authorities also in February 2009 told harrowing stories of being captured and beaten by the Thai military, and then abandoned at open sea. By the end of February, there were reports that of a group of five boats were towed out to open sea, of which four boats sank in a storm, and one washed up on the shore. February 12, 2009 Thailand's prime minister [[Abhisit Vejjajiva]] said there were "some instances" in which Rohingya people were pushed out to sea.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"There are attempts, I think, to let these people drift to other shores. [...] when these practices do occur, it is done on the understanding that there is enough food and water supplied. [...] It's not clear whose work it is [...] but if I have the evidence who exactly did this I will bring them to account."
