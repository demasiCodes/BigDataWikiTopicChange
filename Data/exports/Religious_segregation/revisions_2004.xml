==Muslim world==

Religious segregation occurs in  the Muslim world, where some nations deny non-[[Islam|Muslims]], including [[Jew]]s and [[Christians]], some of the civil rights and voting privileges they grant to Muslims. Many Muslim countries consign non-Muslim [[monotheism|monotheists]] to the status of [[dhimmi]]s, both officially and by custom. Saudi Arabia in particular is notorious for very stringent religious laws banning the practice of non-Muslim religions, even prescribing imprisonment and the [[death penalty]] for attempting to convert Muslims to other religions.

==Northern Ireland==

Many [[Ireland|Irish]] nationalists and republicans have described Northern Ireland as being a [[gerrymander]]ed or even [[apartheid]] state, on the grounds that it was created to ensure a built-in Protestant minority, resulting in discrimination against Catholics in government, education, housing and employment. One legacy of this has been that most state schools in Northern Ireland are either Protestant or Catholic, although there now also a number of integrated schools. This has often exacerbated religious, political and cultural differences between the two comunities. 

Between [[1922]] and [[1972]], Northern Ireland was governed by the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], which was Protestant-dominated, while at local government level, electoral boundaries were similarly devised to create Protestant majorities. The outbreak of the [[The Troubles|Troubles]] led to the imposition of direct rule by the [[United Kingdom|British government]], which has since sought to introduce power sharing between unionists and nationalists.
