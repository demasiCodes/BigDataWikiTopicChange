The debate over the ban on non-Hindus entering Hindu temples began around 30 years ago when singer [[Yesudas]], who planned to take part in a music programme, was stopped at the [[Guruvayur Temple]] gate. He finally had to sing ''[[Bhajan|bhajans]]'' outside the temple wall. Though several temples in [[Kerala]] have signs saying non-Hindus are barred entry, few of them enforce it as strictly as Guruvayur Temple, which insists on following its distinct traditions. 'Only Orthodox Hindus are allowed’, reads a signboard hanging from the Lion's Gate of the Sri Jagannath Temple in [[Puri]]. The issue has triggered many a controversy in the past and continues to arouse strong feelings even today.&lt;ref name="OutlookInd"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sahu |first1=Sandeep |title=SC For Entry Of Non-Hindus Into Puri Jagannath Temple, Will Servitors Allow? |url=https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/sc-for-entry-of-non-hindus-into-puri-jagannath-temple-will-servitors-allow/313183 |website=Outlookindia.com |publisher=Outlook |access-date=25 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In the past a number of dignitaries, including former [[Prime Minister of India|prime minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]], had not been allowed to enter the 12th century shrine; she was married to a [[Parsis|Parsi]], Feroze Gandhi. In 2005, Princess [[Sirindhorn|Mahachakri Sirindhorn]] of [[Thailand]] was not allowed inside the temple as she is a [[Buddhism in Thailand|Buddhist]].&lt;ref name="OutlookInd"/&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In 2006, the shrine did not allow a citizen of [[Switzerland]] named Elizabeth Jigler, who had donated 17.8 million Indian rupees to the temple, because she is a Christian. Kashi Vishvanath Varanasi in [[Varanasi]], the temple stands on the western bank of the [[holy river]] [[Ganges|Ganga]], and is one of the [[12 Jyotirlingas]], the holiest of Shiva temples. The most famous of the many temples in Varanasi is the one dedicated to ''Vishveswara''—[[Shiva]] as Lord of the Universe. Non-Hindus are not allowed inside the temple, although this is not always enforced. On the northern side of [[Kashi Vishwanath Temple|Vishwanath Temple]] is the Gyan Kupor Well. Non-Hindus are also strictly forbidden entry here.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

[[Shi'a Islam]] has been the [[state religion]] of [[Iran]] since the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979. While [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Zoroastrianism]] are officially recognized and legally protected religious minorities, they are not allowed to evangelize or allow Muslim Iranians to convert to other faiths 

Other religious minorities, such as those of the [[Baháʼí Faith]], are not recognized by the government and thus do not have any legal protections nor the [[Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran|constitutional]] right to practice their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/ir0108a.pdf|title=Discrimination against religious minorities in IRAN|page=6|publisher=FIDH|access-date=2008-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim Network for Baháʼí Rights has reported cases of Baháʼí students being expelled from [[university]] due to their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bahairights.org/2007/07/18/bahais-in-iran-deprived-of-their-education/|title=Baha'i children in Egypt not being admitted to schools because of their faith|work=Muslim Network for Bahá'í Rights|access-date=2008-08-03|archive-date=2019-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190301013418/http://www.bahairights.org/2007/07/18/bahais-in-iran-deprived-of-their-education/|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mideastyouth.com/2008/07/06/schools-out-for-the-bahais/|title=School's Out for the Bahá'ís|access-date=2008-08-03|work=Mideast Youth|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120525144733/http://www.mideastyouth.com/2008/07/06/schools-out-for-the-bahais/|archive-date=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bahai.org/story/575|title=Confidential Iran memo exposes policy to deny Bahá'í students university education|work=Bahá'í World News Service|access-date=2008-08-03|date=2007-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|2012 Rakhine State riots}}

The 2012 Rakhine State riots are a series of ongoing conflicts between Rohingya Muslims and ethnic Rakhine in northern [[Rakhine State]], [[Myanmar]]. The riots broke out after weeks of sectarian disputes and they have been condemned by most people on both sides of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-violence-idUSBRE85714E20120608 | title=Four killed as Rohingya Muslims riot in Myanmar: government | work=Reuters | date=8 June 2012 | access-date=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The immediate cause of the riots is unclear, with many commentators citing the killing of ten Burmese Muslims by ethnic Rakhine after the gang rape and murder of a Rakhine woman as the main cause.&lt;ref name=PhilInquirer&gt;{{cite news|last=Lauras|first=Didier|title=Myanmar stung by global censure over unrest|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/271174/myanmar-stung-by-global-censure-over-unrest|access-date=15 September 2012|newspaper=Agence France-Presse in the Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whole villages have been "decimated".&lt;ref name=PhilInquirer /&gt;  Over three hundred houses and a number of public buildings have been razed. According to Tun Khin, the President of the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK (BROUK), as of 28 June 650 Rohingyas have been killed, 1,200 are missing, and more than 80,000 have been displaced.&lt;ref name="dvb_hindstorm"/&gt; According to the Myanmar authorities, the violence, between ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims, left 78 people dead, 87 injured, and thousands of homes destroyed.

The government has responded by imposing curfews and by deploying troops in the region. On 10 June 2012, a [[state of emergency]] was declared in Rakhine, allowing the military to participate in the administration of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://burma.irrawaddy.org/archives/11901 | title=အေရးေပၚအေျခအေန ေၾကညာခ်က္ ႏုိင္ငံေရးသမားမ်ား ေထာက္ခံ | publisher=The Irrawaddy | date=11 June 2012 | access-date=11 June 2012 | author=Linn Htet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first = Fergal | last = Keane | author-link = Fergal Keane | title = Old tensions bubble in Burma | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18402678 | publisher = BBC News | date = 11 June 2012 | access-date = 2012-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Burmese army and police have been accused of targeting Rohingya Muslims through mass arrests and arbitrary violence.&lt;ref name="dvb_hindstorm"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hindstorm|first=Hanna|title=Burmese authorities targeting Rohingyas, UK parliament told|url=http://www.dvb.no/news/burmese-authorities-targeting-rohingyas-uk-parliament-told/22676|access-date=9 July 2012|date=28 June 2012|agency=[[Democratic Voice of Burma]]|archive-date=25 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925033559/http://www.dvb.no/news/burmese-authorities-targeting-rohingyas-uk-parliament-told/22676|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of monks' organisations that played a vital role in Burma's struggle for democracy have taken measures to block any humanitarian assistance to the Rohingya community.&lt;ref name="ti_hindstorm"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hindstorm|first=Hanna|title=Burma's monks call for Muslim community to be shunned|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/burmas-monks-call-for-muslim-community-to-be-shunned-7973317.html|access-date=25 July 2012|date=25 July 2012|work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2005, the UNHCR ([[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]]) had been assisting with the repatriation of Rohingya from Bangladesh, but allegations of human rights abuses in the refugee camps have threatened this effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Despite earlier efforts by the UN, the vast majority of Rohingya refugees have remained in Bangladesh, unable to return because of the regime in Myanmar. Now they face problems in Bangladesh where they do not receive support from the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7019882.stm |title=Burmese exiles in desperate conditions |author=Mark Dummett |date=29 September 2007 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |access-date=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009, many Rohingya refugees were helped by [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]] [[sailor]]s in the [[Strait of Malacca]], after 21 days at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://epaper.kompas.id/|title=ePaper Kompas|first=PT Kompas Media Nusantara|last=kompas@kompas.com|website=ePaper kompas.id}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=February 2019}}

Over the years thousands of Rohingya also have fled to Thailand. There are roughly 111,000 refugees housed in nine camps along the Thai-Myanmar border. There have been charges that groups of them have been shipped and towed out to open sea from Thailand, and left there. In February 2009, there was evidence of the Thai army towing a boatload of 190 Rohingya refugees out to sea. A group of refugees rescued by Indonesian authorities also in February 2009 told harrowing stories of being captured and beaten by the Thai military, and then abandoned at open sea. By the end of February, there were reports that of a group of five boats were towed out to open sea, of which four boats sank in a storm, and one washed up on the shore. On 12 February 2009 Thailand's prime minister [[Abhisit Vejjajiva]] said there were "some instances" in which Rohingya people were pushed out to sea.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"There are attempts, I think, to let these people drift to other shores. [...] when these practices do occur, it is done on the understanding that there is enough food and water supplied. [...] It's not clear whose work it is [...] but if I have the evidence who exactly did this I will bring them to account."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/02/12/thailand.refugees.admission/index.html |title = Thai PM admits boat people pushed out to sea - CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Nepal==
On the banks of the [[Bagmati River]] in [[Kathmandu]], Nepal is a [[Pashupatinath Temple]] dedicated to [[Pashupati]]nath. This temple complex which is on the [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]]'s list since 1979 was erected anew in the 15th century by King kirat Yalamber.

Entry into the inner courtyard is strictly monitored by the temple security, which is selective of who is allowed inside. Only practicing Hindus and Buddhists of Indian and Tibetan descendant are allowed into temple courtyard. Practicing [[Hindus]] and [[Buddhists]] of other than Nepali, Indian, Tibetan descent are not allowed into the temple complex along with other non Hindu visitors. Others can look at the main temple from adjacent side of the river.

[[File:Belfast peace line Cupar Way.jpg|thumb|A "[[peace lines|peace line]]" in [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland, 2010]]
In [[Northern Ireland]] religious segregation has been a phenomenon which increased in many areas, particularly in the capital city of [[Belfast]] and [[Derry]]. This trend increased since the [[Troubles]], a protracted series of conflicts and tensions between [[Roman Catholics]] and [[Protestants]] from the late 1960s to the late 2000s. Segregation does not occur everywhere. State schools are non-denominational, but many Roman Catholics send their children to Roman Catholic Maintained Schools.

In government housing, most people will choose to be housed within their own communities. This form of segregation is most common among lower income people who live in larger towns and cities, and areas where there have been heightened levels of violence.

In 2012 ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' reported: {{quote|The number of "[[peace wall|peacewall]]s{{sic|,"|hide=yes}} physical barriers separating Catholic and Protestant communities, has increased sharply since the first ceasefires in 1994. Most people in the region cannot envisage the barriers being removed, according to a recent survey conducted by the University of Ulster. In housing and education, Northern Ireland remains one of the most segregated tracts of land anywhere on the planet—less than one in 10 children attends a school that is integrated between Catholics and Protestant. This figure has remained stubbornly low despite the cessation of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/12/20/return_of_the_troubles|title=Return of the Troubles|access-date=29 November 2016|via=Foreign Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Allah Bakhsh was totally opposed to the Muslim League's demand for the creation of Pakistan through a division of India on a religious basis. Consequently, he established the Azad Muslim Conference. In its Delhi session held during April 27–30, 1940 some 1400 delegates took part. They belonged mainly to the lower castes and working class. The famous scholar of Indian Islam, Wilfred Cantwell Smith, feels that the delegates represented a ‘majority of India's Muslims’.

Essentially the sentiment in favor of partition has grown in the areas where Muslims are in a small minority, areas which, in any event, would remain undetached from the rest of India. Muslims in provinces where they are in a majority have been less influenced by it ; naturally, for they can stand on their own feet and have no reason to fear other groups. It is least evident in the Northwest Frontier Province (95 per cent Muslim) where the Pathans are brave and self-reliant and have no fear complex. Thus, oddly enough, the Muslim League's proposal to partition India finds far less response in the Muslim areas sought to be partitioned than in the Muslim minority areas which are unaffected by it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the colonial Indian province of [[Sind Province (1936–55)|Sind]], the historian [[Ayesha Jalal]] describes the actions that the pro-separatist Muslim League used in order to spread communal division and undermine the government of [[Allah Bakhsh Soomro]], which [[opposition to the partition of India|stood for a united India]]:&lt;ref name="Jalal2002"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jalal |first1=Ayesha |title=Self and Sovereignty: Individual and Community in South Asian Islam Since 1850 |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134599370 |page=415 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|Even before the 'Pakistan' demand was articulated, the dispute over the Sukkur Manzilgah had been fabricated by provincial Leaguers to unsettle Allah Bakhsh Soomro's ministry which was dependent on support from the Congress and Independent Party. Intended as a way station for Mughal troops on the move, the Manzilgah included a small mosque which had been subsequently abandoned. On a small island in the near distance was the temple of Saad Bela, sacred space for the large number of Hindus settled on the banks of the Indus at Sukkur. The symbolic convergence of the identity and sovereignty over a forgotten mosque provided ammunition for those seeking office at the provincial level. Making an issue out of a non-issue, the Sind Muslim League in early June 1939 formally reclaimed the mosque. Once its deadline of 1 October 1939 for the restoration of the mosque to Muslims had passed, the League started an agitation.&lt;ref name="Jalal2002"/&gt;}}

In the few years before the partition, the Muslim League "monetarily subsidized" mobs that engaged in communal violence against Hindus and Sikhs in the areas of Multan, Rawalpindi, Campbellpur, Jhelum and Sargodha, as well as in the [[Hazara District]].&lt;ref name="Abid2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chitkara1996"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chitkara |first1=M.

The murderous mobs were well supplied with arms, such as daggers, swords, spears and fire-arms. (A former civil servant mentioned in his autobiography that weapon supplies had been sent from NWFP and money was supplied by Delhi-based politicians.) They had bands of stabbers and their auxiliaries, who covered the assailant, ambushed the victim and if necessary disposed of his body. These bands were subsidized monetarily by the Muslim League, and cash payments were made to individual assassins based on the numbers of Hindus and Sikhs killed. There were also regular patrolling parties in jeeps which went about sniping and picking off any stray Hindu or Sikh. ... Thousands of non-combatants including women and children were killed or injured by mobs, supported by the All India Muslim League.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, leaders of the pro-separatist Muslim League, including Muhammad Ali Jinnah, issued no condemnation of the violence against Hindus and Sikhs in the Punjab.&lt;ref name="Ranjan2018"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ranjan |first1=Amit |title=Partition of India: Postcolonial Legacies |date=2018 |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |isbn=9780429750526 |language=en |quote=In the evening of 6 March Muslim mobs numbering in the thousands headed towards Sikh villages in Rawalpindi, Attock and Jhelum districts. ...

Government reports showed that Muslim ex-service persons had taken part in the planned attacks.

{{quotation|Amid a terrible slaughter in which all main communities were both aggressors and victims, somewhere between half a million and a million people were killed. Tens of thousands of women were abducted, usually by men of a different religion. In Punjab in particular, where Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs had lived together for generations and spoke the same language, a stark segregation was brought about as Muslims headed west to Pakistan and Hindus and Sikhs fled east to India. —[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]&lt;ref name="BBC2017"&gt;{{cite web |title=Partition 70 years on: The turmoil, trauma - and legacy |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40643413 |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=11 June 2020 |language=en |date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Today, Pakistan is officially an Islamic country and defines who and who is not a Muslim. Under these conditions, [[Ahmadi Muslims]] are declared non-Muslim by law of the land and cannot practice their faith freely. They are not permitted to call their mosques as mosques, or meet with people with the Islamic [[As-salamu alaykum|greeting of Peace]]. Ahmadi Muslims are excluded from government and any other high-profile positions within Pakistan. There have been cases when the Ahmadi Muslims have been expelled from schools, colleges and universities, for being Ahmadi Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/269390/ahmadis-expelled-from-school | title=Ahmadis expelled from school | publisher=Express Tribune | access-date=April 6, 2014 | date=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.humanrights.asia/news/forwarded-news/AHRC-FPR-047-2013 | title=Persecution of Ahmadis in September 2013
