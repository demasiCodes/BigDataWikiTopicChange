'''Religious segregation''' involves the separation of people on the basis of [[religion]].  
{{Religious persecution|right}}
==Bosnia and Herzegovina==

Religious [[segregation]] runs deep in the country’s society mainly since the [[1990's|90’s]] [[Yugoslav Wars]] in general and [[Bosnian War]] in particular.

From [[Education in Bosnia and Herzegovina|education]] to sports, from [[municipalities]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrmea.com/archives/Jan_Feb_2007/0701038.html A Tale of Two Cities: The Struggle to Return Continues in Bosnia], Peter Lippman, ''[[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]]'', January/February 2007, pages 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; to [[canton (country subdivision)|cantons]] and entities, from [[language policy]] to regional [[flags]] and [[coat of arms]], the strict and sometimes unpeaceful separation between [[Muslim]] [[Bosniaks]], [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Serbs]] and [[Roman Catholic]] [[Croats]] is present in most of BiH’s territory.

[[Jonathan Steele]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' has argued that [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is "a dependent, stifled, apartheid regime". In his view, the [[United Nations|U.N.]] control of Bosnia under the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which he described as "UN-sanctioned liberal imperialism", creates "dependency, stifles civil society, and produces a highly visible financial apartheid in which an international salariat lords it over a war-wounded and jobless local population." &lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Steele|Steele, Jonathan]]. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1639818,00.html Today's Bosnia: a dependent, stifled, apartheid regime]. ''[[The Guardian]]'', November 11, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
In 19th Century Canada, differences between Catholics and Protestants were some of the most important markers of identity.  Catholics in particular wanted the right to include specifically Catholic teaching in public education, something most Protestants were against.  The result was that Canada's constitution created "[[Separate school]]s" specifically for Catholics.

Later on in Canada the religious divide would be eclipsed by a linguistic divide, sometimes known as the [[Two Solitudes]].

== Saudi Arabia ==

Certain roads, areas and cities of [[Saudi Arabia]] are Muslim-Only and [[infidel|non-Muslims]] deliberately "trespassing" may face stiff penalties, including death&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newindpress.com/NewsItems.asp?ID=IER20061219232053&amp;Title=Kerala&amp;rLink=0 Back to life from jaws of death in Saudi Arabia]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Saudi Arabia grants certain [[civil rights]] and voting privileges only to Muslims.&lt;ref name=USSD2006&gt;{{cite web

==Northern Ireland==
{{main|Segregation in Northern Ireland}}
Many [[Ireland|Irish]] [[nationalist]]s and [[Republicanism|republicans]] have described [[Northern Ireland]] as being a [[gerrymander]]ed or even [[apartheid]] state, on the grounds that it was created to ensure a built-in [[Protestant]] majority, resulting in discrimination against [[Catholic]]s in government, [[education]], housing and employment. One legacy of this has been that most state schools in Northern Ireland are predominantly Protestant while the majority of Catholic children attend schools maintained by the Catholic Church, although there are now also a number of integrated schools. This has often exacerbated religious, political and cultural differences between the two communities. 

Between [[1921]] and [[1972]], Northern Ireland was governed by the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], which was Protestant-dominated, while at local government level, electoral boundaries were devised to create Protestant majorities. The outbreak of the [[The Troubles|Troubles]] led to the imposition of direct rule by the [[United Kingdom|British government]], which has since sought to introduce power sharing between [[Unionism (Ireland)|unionists]] and nationalists.

==The Netherlands==
Between (roughly) 1917 and 1966 [[The Netherlands|Dutch society]] and [[Politics of the Netherlands|politics]] were characterized by [[pillarisation]]: a system of ''self-imposed'' religious segregation between [[Roman Catholicism in the Netherlands|Catholics]], [[Reformed Churches in the Netherlands|Reformed]] and [[atheist]]s and liberal protestants. These three groups each had their own [[Special school (Netherlands)|schools]], [[List of political parties in the Netherlands|political parties]], [[labour union]]s, [[employers' association]]s and other forms of social infrastructure. Each religious group lived in its own separated "pillar". On the national level the elites cooperated in a [[consociational democracy|consociational political system]]. This social and political system was based on a particular interpretation of the [[separation of church and state]] formulated by [[Abraham Kuyper]] called [[sphere sovereignty]]. According to [[Arend Lijphart]] it was this system of pillarisation and elite cooperation which resulted in the strong democratic tradition in the Netherlands, a country characterized by religious cleavages.

Today, the importance of [[history of religion in the Netherlands|religion]] in the Netherlands has waned, but still some of these pillarised institutes remain: religious schools for instance still receive government finance and educate about half of the Dutch pupils. Some [[multiculturalism|multiculturalist]] politicians, mainly members of the social-democratic [[PvdA]], the Christian-democratic [[Christian Democratic Appeal|CDA]] and the [[GreenLeft]], have proposed that the growing [[Islam in the Netherlands|Islamic minority]] would be allowed to form its own pillar, other politicians, like [[Pim Fortuyn]] and [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]] have opposed such a system, because it would trap Muslims in a restrictive community.
