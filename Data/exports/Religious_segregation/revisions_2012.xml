The similar term '''religious apartheid''' has also been used for situations where people are separated based on religion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/septemberweb-only/26.0b.html|title=Pakistan's Christians Demand End to 'Religious Apartheid' at Polls|work=Christianity Today|last=Akkaro|first=Anta|accessdate=2008-08-18|date=2000-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; including sociological phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Religion In Schools|url=http://www.teachers.tv/video/24057|series=The Big Debate|airdate=2008-01-29|minutes=0:09:29 and 0:11:52}}, in which Rabbi Dr Jonathan Romain says (at 0:09:29): "If you have separate Jewish, Catholic, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu schools, essentially you’re segregating children, you’re separating children" and (at 0:11:52): "It’s a religious apartheid society we’re creating."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bosnia and Herzegovina==

[[Jonathan Steele]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' has argued that [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is "a dependent, stifled, apartheid regime". In his view, the [[United Nations|U.N.]] control of Bosnia under the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which he described as "UN-sanctioned liberal imperialism", creates "dependency, stifles civil society, and produces a highly visible financial apartheid in which an international salariat lords it over a war-wounded and jobless local population."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Steele|Steele, Jonathan]].

Islam is the official religion of [[Iran]], which is a theocracy led by an [[Ayatollah]], a clerical position.

[[Syria]] is currently ruled by the [[Alawi]]te minority. Compromising only 14% of the population, the Alawites control the government, much of the country's businesses, and its military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jun/19/syria-bashar-assad-opposition-suppression | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Nick | last=Cohen | title=Face the facts – Syria is an apartheid state | date=2011-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] majority has very little representation in the government or military.

==United States==
There are many highly segregated religious groups and sects in the USA, most notable of which are the [[Amish]] and [[Haredi Jews]]. These religious groups segregate themselves from the wider society, create parallel structures and their growth is endogeneous, i.e. depends on group fertility rather than new [[Religious conversion|conversions]].
