The term has been applied to cases of religious-based segregation occurring as a social phenomenon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/3120328|title=Religious Segregation in the Schools of Northern Ireland|last=Knox|first=H.

The similar term '''religious apartheid''' has also been used for situations where people are separated based on religion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/septemberweb-only/26.0b.html|title=Pakistan's Christians Demand End to 'Religious Apartheid' at Polls|work=Christianity Today|last=Akkaro|first=Anta|accessdate=2008-08-18|date=2000-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; including sociological phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Religion In Schools|url=http://www.teachers.tv/video/24057|series=The Big Debate|airdate=2008-01-29|minutes=0:09:29 and 0:11:52}}, in which Rabbi Dr Jonathan Romain says (at 0:09:29): "If you have separate Jewish, Catholic, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu schools, essentially you’re segregating children, you’re separating children" and (at 0:11:52): "It’s a religious apartheid society we’re creating."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bosnia and Herzegovina==

[[Jonathan Steele]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' has argued that [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is "a dependent, stifled, apartheid regime". In his view, the [[United Nations|U.N.]] control of Bosnia under the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which he described as "UN-sanctioned liberal imperialism", creates "dependency, stifles civil society, and produces a highly visible financial apartheid in which an international salariat lords it over a war-wounded and jobless local population."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Steele|Steele, Jonathan]].

==Iran==
Islam is the official religion of [[Iran]], which is a theocracy led by an [[Ayatollah]], a clerical position.

In the Holy Cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], both of which are located in Saudi Arabia, only Muslims are allowed. Non-Muslims may not enter or travel through Mecca; attempting to enter Mecca as a non-Muslim can result in penalties such as a fine;&lt;ref name=mackeymecca&gt;[[Sandra Mackey]]'s account of her attempt to enter Mecca in {{cite book|last=Mackey|first=Sandra|title=The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom|year=1987|pages=63–64|publisher=W.

This restriction has caused problems for Western companies providing services in these cities, as they must hire only Muslims to perform work within the city, or else find ways for its employees to do their work from outside city limits. [[Bell Canada]], which provided telephone service to Mecca and Medina in the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bce.ca/en/news/releases/be/1987/11/12/4083.html|title=BCI One Year Extension Of Saudi Contract|date=1987-11-12|publisher=Bell Canada Enterprises|last=Orr|first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; had offices outside city limits to house its non-Muslim employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mackey|first=Sandra|title=The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom|year=1987|pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was brought before the [[Canadian Human Rights Tribunal]] in the late 1970s for discriminating in employment on the basis of religion (as well as gender).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chrt-tcdp.gc.ca/search/view_html.asp?doid=10&amp;lg=_e&amp;isruling=0|title=In the matter of the complaint of Canadian Human Rights Commission alleging discrimination in employment by Bell Canada|date=1981-01-30|work=Canadian Human Rights Tribunal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
