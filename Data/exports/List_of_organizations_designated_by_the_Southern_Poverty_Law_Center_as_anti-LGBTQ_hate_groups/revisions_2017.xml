The following is a list of notable U.S.-based organizations classified by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC) as [[Anti-LGBT rhetoric|anti-LGBT]] hate groups. The SPLC defines ''[[hate groups]]'' as those that "... have beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics." The SPLC states that hate group activities may include speeches, marches, rallies, meetings, publishing, leafleting, and criminal acts such as violence.&lt;ref name=hatemap&gt;{{cite web|title=Hate Map |access-date=3 September 2014 |url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/hate-map |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5xGmHImZB?url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/hate-map |archive-date=March 18, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SPLC classifies organizations that propagate "known falsehoods – claims about LGBT people that have been thoroughly discredited by scientific authorities – and repeated, groundless name-calling" as anti-LGBT hate groups. The SPLC states that "viewing homosexuality as unbiblical does not qualify organizations to be listed as hate groups."&lt;ref name=Louwagie&gt;{{cite news|last=Louwagie|first=Pam|title=Trying to track hate, in Minnesota and around the country|accessdate=September 8, 2012|newspaper=Star Tribune|date=August 12, 2012|location=Minneapolis, MN |url=http://www.startribune.com/printarticle/?id=165871936 | quote=In the case of groups the center considers anti-gay ... the center says listings are based on 'propagation of known falsehoods – claims about LGBT people that have been thoroughly discredited by scientific authorities – and repeated, groundless name-calling.

In March 2012, the SPLC added eleven groups to the listing: [[United Families International]], [[SaveCalifornia.com]], Sons of Thundr (a.k.a.

==Notable groups listed==
[[LGBT rights opposition|Anti-LGBT]], against [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]], and [[queer]]/[[questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]] ([[LGBTQ]]) people, or anti-gay can refer to activities in certain categories (or combination of categories): attitudes against or discrimination against LGBTQ people, [[violence against LGBT people]], LGBTQ rights opposition and [[LGBT matters and religion|religious opposition to LGBTQ people]]. In its Winter 2010 ''Intelligence Report'' the SPLC noted that for thirty years going back to Anita Bryant's [[Christian fundamentalists]] [[Save Our Children]] campaign, the first organized opposition to the [[LGBT social movements|gay rights movement]] defeating an ordinance banning discrimination in areas of housing, employment, and public accommodation based on [[sexual orientation]], "hard-line elements of the religious right have been searching for ways to demonize gay people – or, at a minimum, to find arguments that will prevent their normalization in society." These groups utilize anti-gay myths to "form the basis of its claim that homosexuality is a social evil that must be suppressed – an opinion rejected by virtually all relevant medical and scientific authorities." The SPLC notes these anti-gay myths "almost certainly contribute to [[hate crime]] violence directed at the LGBT community, which is more targeted for such attacks than any other minority group in America."&lt;ref name=agmyths&gt;{{cite news|title=10 Anti-Gay Myths Debunked|url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2010/winter/10-myths|accessdate=September 16, 2012|newspaper=Intelligence Report|date=2010 |volume=140 |author=Evelyn Schlatter|author2=Robert Steinback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alliance Defending Freedom===

In 2013, the SPLC described the [[Alliance Defending Freedom]] (ADF) as a "virulently anti-gay" organization. According to the SPLC, the ADF advocates in favor of the [[LGBT rights by country|criminalization of homosexuality]], opposes equal rights for LGBT people, including [[marriage equality]], and makes false claims about the lives of LGBT people. In 2003, the ADF filed an unsuccessful [[amicus curiae|amicus brief]] in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' asking the Supreme Court to uphold Texas' [[sodomy law|criminal prohibition of sodomy]]. It has also published documents intended for school distribution stating that “there are moral, social, and medical reasons why homosexual behavior should not be affirmed,” and citing medical studies and crime statistics indicating that homosexuals frequently engage in promiscuous behavior, and have a high rate of violent crime and mental illness.&lt;ref name=SPLC-ADF&gt;[https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/alliance-defending-freedom Extremist Files: Alliance Defending Freedom]. [[Southern Poverty Law Center]].&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative columnist and professor [[Mike Adams (columnist)|Mike Adams]] criticized the SPLC for the designation because "Their reason for the characterization was simply that the ADF opposes efforts of the LGBT community to impose its agenda on those who disagree with them for religious reasons."&lt;ref&gt;For the ''Intelligence Report'' articles, see:

Founded in 1992, its mission is focused on "upholding and re-affirming marriage, family, life and liberty in Illinois," and is affiliated with the [[American Family Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://illinoisfamily.org/about/ |title=About |author=Illinois Family Institute|accessdate=July 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also has a sister organization, [[Illinois Family Action]], founded in 2010 it is active as a [[501(c)(4)]] lobbying organization in the state of Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.illinoisfamilyaction.org/?page_id=2 |title=About |author=Illinois Family Action|accessdate=July 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's executive director is David E.

The Illinois Family Institute was designated an anti-gay hate group in 2009 by the SPLC, on the grounds that it is "heavily focused on attacking gay people and homosexuality in general."&lt;ref name=Schlatter2010&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2010/winter/the-hard-liners |last=Schlatter |first=Evelyn |title=18 Anti-Gay Groups and Their Propaganda |work=Intelligence Report |date=Winter 2010 |issue=140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its ''Intelligence Report'', the SPLC states the designation was based on the association with [[Paul Cameron]], a researcher whose studies about the lives of homosexuals have been "utterly discredited", and on the association with LaBarbera who repeats the disproved link between [[gay]] men and [[pedophilia]].&lt;ref name="splcenter1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schlatter2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name="splcenter" /&gt; Cameron has been removed from professional and scholarly organizations and his studies have been met with formal resolutions passed against him.&lt;ref name=Schlatter2010 /&gt; LaBarbera has endorsed Cameron's research and has said that ways should be found "to bring back shame" for homosexual behavior.&lt;ref name=Schlatter2010 /&gt; As well, Higgins' words were linked to the hate group designation, including her comparison of homosexuality to [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name=Schlatter2010 /&gt;

Its first [[Church service|public service]] was held on the afternoon of Sunday, November 27, 1955.&lt;ref name="date-sermon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.godhatesamerica.com/sound/ghfsermons/OSBH19880131.mp3|title=Sermon preached by Fred Phelps|year=1987|accessdate=January 14, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208014706/http://www.godhatesamerica.com/sound/ghfsermons/OSBH19880131.mp3 |archivedate=December 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church has been actively involved in the anti-gay movement since at least 1991 when it sought a crackdown on homosexual activity at [[Gage Park, Topeka|Gage Park]] six blocks northwest of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, K. Ryan (2008), ''Fall from Grace'' (documentary)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to anti-gay protests at military funerals, the organization pickets other celebrity funerals and public events that are likely to get it media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wing|first=Nick|title=Elizabeth Edwards Funeral To Be Picketed By Westboro Baptist Church|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/09/elizabeth-edwards-funeral-westboro-baptist-church_n_794333.html|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=December 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WBC is not affiliated with any known [[Baptist]] conventions or associations and the two largest Baptist denominations, the [[Baptist World Alliance]] and the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] have denounced the WBC over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.christiantoday.com/article/baptists-denounce-latest-westboro-stunt/5495.html |accessdate=September 9, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church describes itself as following [[Primitive Baptist]] and [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Westboro Baptist Church|url=http://www.godhatesfags.com/wbcinfo/aboutwbc.html|work=God Hates Fags|publisher=Westboro Baptist Church|accessdate=October 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church runs numerous Web sites such as GodHatesFags.com, GodHatesAmerica.com and others expressing condemnation of homosexuality. The group bases its work around the belief expressed by its best known slogan and the address of its primary Web site, God Hates Fags, asserting that every tragedy in the world is linked to homosexuality – specifically society's increasing tolerance and acceptance of the so-called [[homosexual agenda]]. The group maintains that God hates gays above all other kinds of "sinners"&lt;ref name="wbc-faq"&gt;[http://www.godhatesfags.com/faq.html#Focus "Westboro Baptist Church FAQ"].&lt;/ref&gt; and that homosexuality should be a [[capital punishment|capital crime]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/dec2002/Outlaw_Sodomy_12-3-2002.pdf "Outlaw Sodomy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819091609/http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/dec2002/Outlaw_Sodomy_12-3-2002.pdf |date=August 19, 2006 }}, December 3, 2002,&lt;/ref&gt; Their views on homosexuality are partially based on teachings found in the [[Old Testament]], specifically Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13, which they interpret to mean that homosexual behavior is detestable, and that homosexuals should be put to death, respectively.&lt;ref name="wbc-faq" /&gt;

The [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) describes the Westboro Baptist Church as "virulently homophobic", whose anti-homosexual rhetoric they say is often a cover for [[anti-Semitism]], [[anti-Americanism]], racism, and [[anti-Catholicism]].&lt;ref name="adl-phelps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/special_reports/wbc/default.asp |title=Westboro Baptist Church |publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] |accessdate=March 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308113420/http://www.adl.org/special_reports/wbc/default.asp |archivedate=March 8, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SPLC added the Westboro Baptist Church to its list of hate groups in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/groups/westboro-baptist-church "Westboro Baptist Church"].

===You Can Run But You Cannot Hide International===
[[You Can Run But You Cannot Hide International]] (YCRBYCHI) is a United States organization identifying itself as a Christian [[youth ministry]] that holds assemblies, including music concerts and discussions with students, in [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]]. Founded by Bradlee Dean, the organization is based in [[Annandale, Minnesota]]. YCRBYCHI's mission statement is: "To reshape America by re-directing the current and future generations both morally and spiritually through education, media, and the Judeo-Christian values found in our U.S. Constitution."&lt;ref name="about us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youcanruninternational.com/aboutus.html|title=About Us |work=You Can Run International|accessdate=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization has garnered letters of support from school personnel, as well as some religious and political figures. It has also drawn controversy for using assemblies for religious purposes, misleading school administrators about the nature of the program, and proselytizing its views on [[abortion]] and [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sauer|first=Abe|title='My War': Bradlee Dean's Popular Struggle Against Those Criminal, Child-Molesting Gays|url=http://www.theawl.com/2010/10/my-war-bradlee-deans-popular-struggle-against-those-criminal-child-molesting-gays|newspaper=The Awl|date=October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="minnesotaindependent1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fecke|first=Jeff|url=http://minnesotaindependent.com/2652/because-god-said-youth-ministry-uses-deception-to-gain-access-to-public-schools |title=Because God said: Youth ministry uses deception to gain access to public schools |publisher=Minnesota Independent |date=November 3, 2007|accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="minnesotaindependent2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Birkey|first=Andy|url=http://minnesotaindependent.com/45902/michele-bachmann-to-fundraise-for-controversial-ministry |title=Bachmann to raise funds for controversial Christian punk ministry |newspaper=Minnesota Independent |date=September 30, 2009|accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
