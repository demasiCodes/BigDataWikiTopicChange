The following is a list of U.S.-based organizations classified by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC) as [[Anti-LGBT rhetoric|anti-gay]] hate groups. The SPLC defines ''[[hate groups]]'' as those that "... have beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics." The SPLC states that hate group activities may include speeches, marches, rallies, meetings, publishing, leafleting—and criminal acts such as violence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tolerance.org/maps/hate/index.html |title=SPLCenter.org: Hate Groups Map |publisher=Tolerance.org |accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SPLC classifies organizations that propagate "known falsehoods – claims about LGBT people that have been thoroughly discredited by scientific authorities – and repeated, groundless name-calling" as anti-gay hate groups. The SPLC states that "viewing homosexuality as unbiblical does not qualify organizations for listing as hate groups."&lt;ref name=Louwagie&gt;{{cite news|last=Louwagie|first=Pam|title=Trying to track hate, in Minnesota and around the country|accessdate=September 8, 2012|newspaper=Star Tribune|date=August 12, 2012|location=Minneapolis, MN |url=http://www.startribune.com/printarticle/?id=165871936 | quote=In the case of groups the center considers anti-gay, including the Anoka-Hennepin district's Parents Action League, the center says listings are based on "propagation of known falsehoods – claims about LGBT people that have been thoroughly discredited by scientific authorities – and repeated, groundless name-calling. Viewing homosexuality as unbiblical does not qualify organizations for listing as hate groups." The center's Heidi Beirich said the Parents Action League was included on their hate list for "damaging propaganda about the gay community," including calling gays and lesbians "promiscuous, dysfunctional, unhealthy." }}&lt;/ref&gt; President of the SPLC Richard Cohen clarified "[B]y 'known falsehoods,' we mean such things as asserting that gays and lesbians are more disposed to molesting children than heterosexuals – which the overwhelming weight of credible scientific research has determined is patently untrue.

He became an [[evangelism|evangelist]] for several years after leaving the military. He founded the Bethesda Temple of San Antonio when he was 26. The church was renamed the Bethesda Christian Institute.
In 2007, he published ''The Insanity of Christianity'', which contains a chapter called "The Gay Community." In it, he argues that the "[[gay lifestyle]]" is not simply an [[alternative lifestyle]], but the [[sin]] of [[sodomy]] according to the Bible. He says gay people should not be Christian church leaders for the same reason adulterers should not. Foster asks if we accept the gay lifestyle "why wouldn't a person have a right to sexually seduce their own children as a lifestyle? Is rape just another lifestyle? Is incest just another lifestyle? Is stealing just another lifestyle? Is murder just another lifestyle?"&lt;ref name="foster2007"&gt;Foster, J.V. (2007). ''The Insanity of Christianity: Or the Other Side of the Coin.''

===Chalcedon Foundation===
The [[Chalcedon Foundation]] is an American [[Christian Reconstructionism|Christian Reconstructionist]] organization founded by [[Rousas John Rushdoony]]. Named for the [[Council of Chalcedon]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chalcedon.edu/vision.php "Chalcedon Vision Statement"]&lt;/ref&gt; it has also included [[theologian]]s such as [[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]], who later founded his own organization, the Institute for Christian Economics.  The Chalcedon Foundation was officially founded by Rushdoony in the summer of 1965. In 1971, North was hired part-time, and two years later North was hired full-time while [[Greg Bahnsen]] was also hired. Rushdoony founded Ross House Books in 1976, the same year in which North and Bahnsen left the Foundation to pursue careers elsewhere. In 1977, the Foundation's first office building was built. A decade later, the organization's ''Newsletter'' became a magazine, the ''Chalcedon Report''. On February 8, 2001, Rushdoony died. He was succeeded by his son Mark Rushdoony, who continues to run the organization. In 2004, Ross House Books merged with Chalcedon, and in 2005, the ''Chalcedon Report'' was renamed ''Faith for All of Life''.

The Chalcedon Foundation has been listed as a [[hate group]] by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC).&lt;ref name="Waddington" /&gt; The SPLC notes that ''[[The Institutes of Biblical Law]]'', written by Rushdoony in 1973, called for strict [[Christian views on the old covenant|biblical law]] that would "mean the death penalty for 'practicing homosexuals,' among many other 'abominators.'"&lt;ref name=Chalcsplc&gt;{{cite news|title=A Dozen Major Groups Help Drive the Religious Right's Anti-Gay Crusade|url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2005/spring/a-mighty-army|accessdate=August 30, 2012|newspaper=Intelligence Report|date=Spring 2005; Issue 117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FRC promotes what it considers to be traditional [[family values]], by advocating and lobbying for [[socially conservative]] policies.

:MATTHEWS: I’m just asking you, should we outlaw gay behavior?

They seek "...to restore a world where marriage is upheld and honored, where children are nurtured and protected, and where homosexuality is not taught and accepted, but instead is discouraged and rejected at every level."&lt;ref name="FRI"/&gt; The ''Boston Globe'' reported that the FRI's 2005 budget was less than [[United States dollar|$]]200,000.&lt;ref name="BG"/&gt;

Its first [[Church service|public service]] was held on the afternoon of Sunday, November 27, 1955.&lt;ref name="date-sermon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.godhatesamerica.com/sound/ghfsermons/OSBH19880131.mp3|title=Sermon preached by Fred Phelps|year=1987|accessdate=January 14, 2012|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061208014706/http://www.godhatesamerica.com/sound/ghfsermons/OSBH19880131.mp3 |archivedate = December 8, 2006,}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church has been actively involved in the anti-gay movement since at least 1991 when it sought a crackdown on homosexual activity at [[Gage Park, Topeka|Gage Park]] six blocks northwest of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, K. Ryan (2008), ''Fall from Grace'' (documentary)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to anti-gay protests at military funerals, the organization pickets other celebrity funerals and public events that are likely to get it media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wing|first=Nick|title=Elizabeth Edwards Funeral To Be Picketed By Westboro Baptist Church|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/09/elizabeth-edwards-funeral-westboro-baptist-church_n_794333.html|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=December 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests have also been held demonstrating against Jews and some protests included stomping on the [[flag of the United States]].

The WBC is not affiliated with any known [[Baptist]] conventions or associations and the two largest Baptist denominations, the [[Baptist World Alliance]] and the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] have denounced the WBC over the years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://au.christiantoday.com/article/baptists-denounce-latest-westboro-stunt/5495.html ]{{dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church describes itself as following [[Primitive Baptist]] and [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Westboro Baptist Church|url=http://www.godhatesfags.com/wbcinfo/aboutwbc.html|work=God Hates Fags|publisher=Westboro Baptist Church|accessdate=October 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church runs numerous Web sites such as GodHatesFags.com, GodHatesAmerica.com and others expressing condemnation of homosexuality. The group bases its work around the belief expressed by its best known slogan and the address of its primary Web site, God Hates Fags, asserting that every tragedy in the world is linked to homosexuality—specifically society's increasing tolerance and acceptance of the so-called [[homosexual agenda]]. The group maintains that God hates gays above all other kinds of "sinners"&lt;ref name="wbc-faq"&gt;[http://www.godhatesfags.com/faq.html#Focus "Westboro Baptist Church FAQ"].&lt;/ref&gt; and that homosexuality should be a [[capital punishment|capital crime]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/dec2002/Outlaw_Sodomy_12-3-2002.pdf "Outlaw Sodomy"], December 3, 2002,&lt;/ref&gt; Their views on homosexuality are partially based on teachings found in the [[Old Testament]], specifically Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13, which they interpret to mean that homosexual behavior is detestable, and that homosexuals should be put to death, respectively.&lt;ref name="wbc-faq"/&gt;

The [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) describes the Westboro Baptist Church as "virulently homophobic", whose anti-homosexual rhetoric they say is often a cover for [[anti-Semitism]], [[anti-Americanism]], racism, and [[anti-Catholicism]].&lt;ref name="adl-phelps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/special_reports/wbc/default.asp|title=Westboro Baptist Church|publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]|accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC), an anti-discrimination group, has added the Westboro Baptist Church to its list of hate groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/groups/westboro-baptist-church "Westboro Baptist Church"].

===You Can Run But You Cannot Hide International===
[[You Can Run But You Cannot Hide International]] (YCRBYCHI) is a United States organization identifying itself as a Christian [[youth ministry]] that holds assemblies, including music concerts and discussions with students, in [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]].  Founded by Bradlee Dean, the organization is based in [[Annandale, Minnesota]]. YCRBYCHI's mission statement is: "To reshape America by re-directing the current and future generations both morally and spiritually through education, media, and the Judeo-Christian values found in our U.S. Constitution."&lt;ref name="about us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youcanruninternational.com/aboutus.html|title=About Us |work=You Can Run International|accessdate =April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization has garnered letters of support from school personnel, as well as some religious and political figures. It has also drawn controversy for using assemblies for religious purposes, misleading school administrators about the nature of the program, and proselytizing its views on [[abortion]] and [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sauer|first=Abe|title='My War': Bradlee Dean's Popular Struggle Against Those Criminal, Child-Molesting Gays|url=http://www.theawl.com/2010/10/my-war-bradlee-deans-popular-struggle-against-those-criminal-child-molesting-gays|newspaper=The Awl|date=October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="minnesotaindependent1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fecke|first=Jeff|url=http://minnesotaindependent.com/2652/because-god-said-youth-ministry-uses-deception-to-gain-access-to-public-schools |title=Because God said: Youth ministry uses deception to gain access to public schools |publisher=Minnesota Independent |date=November 3, 2007|accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="minnesotaindependent2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Birkey|first=Andy|url=http://minnesotaindependent.com/45902/michele-bachmann-to-fundraise-for-controversial-ministry |title=Bachmann to raise funds for controversial Christian punk ministry |newspaper=Minnesota Independent |date=September 30, 2009|accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
