The following is a list of notable U.S.-based organizations classified by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC), an American civil rights organization, as [[Anti-LGBT rhetoric|anti-LGBT]] hate groups. The SPLC defines ''[[hate groups]]'' as those that "... have beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics." The SPLC states that hate group activities may include speeches, marches, rallies, meetings, publishing, leafleting, and criminal acts such as violence.&lt;ref name=hatemap&gt;{{cite web|title=Hate Map |access-date=3 September 2014 |url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/hate-map |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305121253/http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/hate-map |archive-date=March 5, 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SPLC classifies organizations that propagate "known falsehoods – claims about LGBT people that have been thoroughly discredited by scientific authorities – and repeated, groundless name-calling" as anti-LGBT hate groups. The SPLC states that "viewing homosexuality as unbiblical does not qualify organizations to be listed as hate groups."&lt;ref name=Louwagie&gt;{{cite news|last=Louwagie|first=Pam|title=Trying to track hate, in Minnesota and around the country|access-date=September 8, 2012|newspaper=Star Tribune|date=August 12, 2012|location=Minneapolis, MN |url=http://www.startribune.com/printarticle/?id=165871936 | quote=In the case of groups the center considers anti-gay ... the center says listings are based on 'propagation of known falsehoods – claims about LGBT people that have been thoroughly discredited by scientific authorities – and repeated, groundless name-calling.

Richard Cohen]] clarified "[B]y 'known falsehoods,' we mean such things as asserting that gays and lesbians are more disposed to molesting children than heterosexuals – which the overwhelming weight of credible scientific research has determined is patently untrue.

The SPLC's data on hate groups was questioned by journalist [[Ken Silverstein]] who argues that the organization sometimes exaggerates the threats posed by certain groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Conover |first=Ted |url=http://www.harpers.org/archive/2010/03/hbc-90006753 |title='Hate,' Immigration, and the Southern Poverty Law Center |publisher=harpers.org |date=March 2010 |access-date=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of an August 2012 shooting at the headquarters of the [[Family Research Council]], ''Washington Post'' columnist Dana Milbank criticized the SPLC's listing of the Family Research Council as an anti-gay hate group while others, including [[Americablog]]'s former editor [[John Aravosis]], defended the categorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Aravosis, John|author-link1=John Aravosis|title=Why the Family Research Council is a hate group|url=http://americablog.com/2012/08/why-the-family-research-council-is-a-hate-group-2.html|website=americablog.com|access-date=5 April 2017|date=August 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/22dana-milbank-washington-post-family-research-council-hate-group_n_1822805.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130126012804/http://huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/22dana-milbank-washington-post-family-research-council-hate-group_n_1822805.html|archive-date=2013-01-26|title=Dana Milbank, Washington Post Writer, Slams LGBT Activists, SPLC For FRC's 'Hate Group' Label|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, the SPLC added eleven groups to the listing: [[United Families International]], [[SaveCalifornia.com]], Sons of Thundr (a.k.a.

In early 2014, the SPLC added seven groups: [[World Congress of Families]]/Howard Center For Family, Religion and Society, based in Rockford, Illinois, the Catholic Family and Human Rights institute (C-FAM), the Ruth Institute, the [[Pray in Jesus Name]] Project, [[Pacific Justice Institute]], [[Mission: America]] and the [[Liberty Counsel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2014/03/seven-more-groups-now-designated-by-splc-as-anti-gay-hate-groups-2/ |title=Seven more groups now designated by SPLC as anti-gay hate groups |author=McCewin, Alvin |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210030230/http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2014/03/seven-more-groups-now-designated-by-splc-as-anti-gay-hate-groups-2/ |archive-date=December 10, 2014 |url-status=live |date=March 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable groups listed==
[[LGBT rights opposition|Anti-LGBT]], against [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]], and [[queer]]/[[questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]] ([[LGBTQ]]) people, or anti-gay can refer to activities in certain categories (or combination of categories): attitudes against or discrimination against LGBTQ people, [[violence against LGBT people]], LGBTQ rights opposition and [[LGBT matters and religion|religious opposition to LGBTQ people]]. In its Winter 2010 ''Intelligence Report'' the SPLC noted that for thirty years going back to Anita Bryant's [[Christian fundamentalists]] [[Save Our Children]] campaign, the first organized opposition to the [[LGBT social movements|gay rights movement]] defeating an ordinance banning discrimination in areas of housing, employment, and public accommodation based on [[sexual orientation]], "hard-line elements of the religious right have been searching for ways to demonize gay people – or, at a minimum, to find arguments that will prevent their normalization in society." These groups utilize anti-gay myths to "form the basis of its claim that homosexuality is a social evil that must be suppressed – an opinion rejected by virtually all relevant medical and scientific authorities." The SPLC notes these anti-gay myths "almost certainly contribute to [[hate crime]] violence directed at the LGBT community, which is more targeted for such attacks than any other minority group in America."&lt;ref name=agmyths&gt;{{cite news|title=10 Anti-Gay Myths Debunked|url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2010/winter/10-myths|access-date=September 16, 2012|newspaper=Intelligence Report|date=2010 |volume=140 |author=Evelyn Schlatter|author2=Robert Steinback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alamo Christian Foundation===
{{main|Alamo Christian Foundation}}The Alamo Christian Foundation was a cult founded by Tony Alamo and one of his wives, Susan Alamo in 1969 in Hollywood, California and later relocated to Dyer, Arkansas. The cult was plagued with legal troubles stemming from allegations of member abuse and tax troubles with the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]. The cult dissolved when Tony Alamo was arrested and convicted on ten counts of [[child sexual abuse]] in 2009. 

===Alliance Defending Freedom===
In 2013, the SPLC described the [[Alliance Defending Freedom]] (ADF) as a "virulently anti-gay" organization. According to the SPLC, the ADF advocates in favor of the [[LGBT rights by country|criminalization of homosexuality]], opposes equal rights for LGBT people, including [[marriage equality]], and makes false claims about the lives of LGBT people. In 2003, the ADF filed an unsuccessful [[amicus curiae|amicus brief]] in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' asking the Supreme Court to uphold Texas' [[sodomy law|criminal prohibition of sodomy]]. It has also published documents intended for school distribution stating that "there are moral, social, and medical reasons why homosexual behavior should not be affirmed," and citing medical studies and crime statistics indicating that homosexuals frequently engage in promiscuous behavior, and have a high rate of violent crime and mental illness.&lt;ref name=SPLC-ADF&gt;[https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/alliance-defending-freedom Extremist Files: Alliance Defending Freedom]. [[Southern Poverty Law Center]].&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative columnist and professor [[Mike Adams (columnist)|Mike Adams]] criticized the SPLC for the designation because "Their reason for the characterization was simply that the ADF opposes efforts of the LGBT community to impose its agenda on those who disagree with them for religious reasons."&lt;ref&gt;For the ''Intelligence Report'' articles, see:

Its first [[Church service|public service]] was held on the afternoon of Sunday, November 27, 1955.&lt;ref name="date-sermon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.godhatesamerica.com/sound/ghfsermons/OSBH19880131.mp3|title=Sermon preached by Fred Phelps|year=1987|access-date=January 14, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208014706/http://www.godhatesamerica.com/sound/ghfsermons/OSBH19880131.mp3 |archive-date=December 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church has been actively involved in the anti-gay movement since at least 1991 when it sought a crackdown on homosexual activity in [[Gage Park, Topeka|Gage Park]] six blocks northwest of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, K. Ryan (2008), ''Fall from Grace'' (documentary)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to anti-gay protests at military funerals, the organization pickets other celebrity funerals and public events that are likely to give it media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wing|first=Nick|title=Elizabeth Edwards Funeral To Be Picketed By Westboro Baptist Church|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/09/elizabeth-edwards-funeral-westboro-baptist-church_n_794333.html|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=December 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church runs numerous Web sites including GodHatesFags.com and GodHatesAmerica.com, which all condemn homosexuality. The group bases its work around its belief which is expressed in its best known slogan and the address of its primary Web site, God Hates Fags, which asserts that every tragedy in the world is linked to homosexuality – specifically society's increasing tolerance and acceptance of the so-called [[homosexual agenda]]. The group believes that God hates gays above all other kinds of "sinners"&lt;ref name="wbc-faq"&gt;[http://www.godhatesfags.com/faq.html#Focus "Westboro Baptist Church FAQ"].&lt;/ref&gt; and it also believes that homosexuality should be a [[capital punishment|capital crime]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/dec2002/Outlaw_Sodomy_12-3-2002.pdf "Outlaw Sodomy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819091609/http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/dec2002/Outlaw_Sodomy_12-3-2002.pdf |date=August 19, 2006 }}, December 3, 2002,&lt;/ref&gt; Its views on homosexuality are partially based on teachings which are found in the [[Old Testament]], specifically in Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13, which they interpret to mean that homosexual behavior is detestable.

The ADL describes the Westboro Baptist Church as being "virulently [[Homophobia|homophobic]]", but according to the ADL, its anti-homosexual rhetoric is often a cover for [[antisemitism]], [[anti-Americanism]], [[racism]], and [[anti-Catholicism]].&lt;ref name="adl-phelps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/special_reports/wbc/default.asp |title=Westboro Baptist Church |publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] |access-date=March 14, 2011  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308113420/http://www.adl.org/special_reports/wbc/default.asp |archive-date=March 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SPLC added the Westboro Baptist Church to its list of hate groups in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/groups/westboro-baptist-church "Westboro Baptist Church"].

===You Can Run But You Cannot Hide International===
[[You Can Run But You Cannot Hide International]] (YCRBYCHI) is a United States-based organization which identifies itself as a Christian [[youth ministry]] that holds assemblies, including music concerts and discussions with students, in [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]]. Founded by Bradlee Dean, the organization is based in [[Annandale, Minnesota]]. YCRBYCHI's mission statement is: "To reshape America by re-directing the current and future generations both morally and spiritually through education, media, and the [[Judeo-Christian]] values found in our U.S. Constitution."&lt;ref name="about us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youcanruninternational.com/aboutus.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929022537/http://youcanruninternational.com/aboutus.html|archive-date=September 29, 2009|title=About Us|work=You Can Run International|access-date=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
