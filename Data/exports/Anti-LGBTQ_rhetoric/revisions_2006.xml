They often work together to create an [[anti-gay]] [[ideology]]. In the modern [[western world|West]] they are regarded by some as manifestations of [[homophobia]].

These slogans, along with scriptural prohibitions, have a long history, with some dating back at least as far as [[Classical Greece]] 2500 years ago. They range from the demeaning and pejorative to those expressing antipathy on [[religion and homosexuality|religious]], medical, or moral grounds. They may also use terms of invective like "[[Faggot (epithet)|fag]]" or "[[Faggot (epithet)|faggot]]".

These slogans are still used to convey opposition to homosexuality. They reflect the [[spectrum]] of opinion among those who oppose homosexuality and [[LGBT social movements|full acceptance of gayness in society]]. It is important to note that opposition to homosexuality and "homosexual acts" is by no means [[monolithic]]; a proponent of one of these "slogans" may find other "slogans" to be mean-spirited, offensive, and/or unsupportable.

== Themes ==
Some concepts and arguments against same-sex desire and practices have been repeated over the centuries, though the importance of specific arguments has varied from culture to culture. For example, preoccupation with child abuse is a largely modern concern, and the importance of Biblical arguments rises and falls along with the influence of Judeo-Christian beliefs. 

=== Declaration that same-sex desire is unnatural ===
This particular charge dates back to [[Plato]], who argued in the ''Laws'' I 636c and VIII 841d that homosexual sex was "against nature" ''(para phusin).'' This argument was echoed by [[Paul of Tarsus]], in a claim to the same effect in the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. In recent times the discussion has been framed in psychiatric rather than philosophical terms, with the claim that it is a [[sexual perversion]].

Though the psychiatric establishment did medicalize same-sex desire, that position has been revised and homosexuality was later removed as a medical disorder from the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apa.org/topics/orientation.html American Psychological Association: Sexuality]&lt;/ref&gt;. Recent work by biologists has shown same-sex sexuality to be widespread in nature (see: [[animal sexuality]]) as well as in human society, leading gay rights advocates to assert that opposition to same-sex desire would itself be against nature. {{citation needed}}

However, according to one rebuttal of this argument, held by, among others, The American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family, and Property, there are some behaviors exhibited by many animals that most would consider unnatural in humans, such as cannibalism. &lt;ref&gt;The American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family, and Property. "Defending a Higher Law". [http://www.tfp.org/TFPForum/online_library/Defending_A_Higher_Law.pdf], page 89&lt;/ref&gt;. The counter argument to this claim is that it confuses "unnatural" with "wrong", thus this is no more than a restatement of the claim that homosexuality is ''morally'' wrong (like cannibalism), not that it is unnatural.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpva.com/Archives/Editorial/Hugman/20060415.shtml The Liberarian Party of Virginia, Opponents of same-sex marriage use flawed arguments, by Michael Hugman]&lt;/ref&gt; These issues are complicated by the [[polysemous]] character of the terms "natural" and "unnatural" which can be used in many equivocal ways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/natural.html Skeptic's dictionary, "Natural"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Catholic Church]], among others, uses 'nature' to refer to [[natural law]], which, in their view excludes same-sex sex, along with other actions it sees as immoral. {{citation needed}}

=== Blame for Biblical plagues and natural disasters ===
{{main|Religion and homosexuality}}
Since the middle ages, sodomites were blamed for "bringing down the wrath of God" upon the land, and their pleasures blamed for the periodic epidemics of disease which decimated the population. This "pollution" was thought to be cleansed by fire (modelled after the  biblical destruction of [[Sodom]] and [[Gomorrah]]), as a result of which countless individuals were burned at the stake or run through with white-hot iron rods. {{citation needed}}

A modern example of this type of thinking was shown by the [[Jerry Falwell|Rev. Jerry Falwell]], who blamed gays and lesbians (among others) for indirectly causing the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington of [[September 11]], [[2001]]. On the broadcast of the Christian television program "The 700 Club," Falwell made the following statement (for which he later apologized):

&lt;blockquote&gt;I really believe that the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the [[ACLU]], People For the American Way, all of them who have tried to secularize America. I point the finger in their face and say 'you helped this happen.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/14/Falwell.apology/ CNN report of Falwell's speech]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since the [[1980s]], similar accusations have been made, inspired by the [[AIDS]] epidemic, labeling it a gay [[disease]] and divine retribution against homosexuals. {{citation needed}}

=== Conflation with child abuse ===

:''See also: [[Gay rights counter-movement]]''

This is an accusation which predates the current era, as it was leveled against [[pederasty|pederasts]] even during [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]].  &lt;ref&gt;[[Lucian]]. ''Erotes''&lt;/ref&gt;
More recently, this charge has been phrased as "recruitment", implying that homosexuals are somehow predatory on children, or are "recruiting" in secret. A common slogan is "Homosexuals cannot reproduce &amp;mdash; so they must recruit" or its variants.  One such example of a similar charge and its underlying argument, offered by the [[Family Research Council]] can be found [http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=IS02E3 here].

In an Advocate.com interview on his [[2000]] work, ''Outlaw Representation: Censorship and Homosexuality in 20th-Century American Art,'' [[Richard Meyer]] discusses this line of attack:
&lt;blockquote&gt;. . . those who attacked [[Robert Mapplethorpe|Mapplethorpe]]'s work in the late [[1980]]s used this photograph to reinforce long-standing stereotypes of gay men as pedophiles. Although no sexual activity is shown (or even suggested) in the portrait, and although the picture was commissioned by the child's mother who was in the room at the time of its taking, the very fact that Mapplethorpe had photographed a naked boy was enough, at least in the minds of [[Pat Robertson]] and [[Jesse Helms]], for the photographer to be accused of child molestation.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Tim. Taking on the Antigay Censors. advocate.com, 2001. [http://web.archive.org/web/20050309010753/http://www.advocate.com/html/stories/857/857_outlaw.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Among the counterarguments used to refute the charge are that it is based on the denial of the comparable abuse of young girls by men who prefer the opposite sex, and on the infantilization of adolescents who in a different context would be considered to have come of age. The reports of young people discovering their attraction to others of the same sex at an early age contradict claims that those young people were subject to outside persuasion. {{citation needed}}

Current studies contradict the idea that homosexuals are pedophiles. Both national organizations for Psychiatry and Psychology and the FBI have concluded that 98% of all pedophiles are heterosexual men and that the remaining 2% of pedophiles include women and not just homosexuals. Child molestors arrested who were members of the [[North American Man/Boy Love Association]] (NAMBLA), have been married men predominantly with children who identified as heterosexual.

=== Dissipation of vital force ===
This argument has been phrased since antiquity in agricultural terms, as "casting one's seed on sterile rocks." {{citation needed}} There was a recognized need for producing more children, generally to keep society going through the traditions of the family and farming. The concern was that more non-procreative sex would "ruin" the participants, reduce society's growth, and perhaps even contribute to social collapse. {{citation needed}}

It is not clear then why chastity ("casting no seed at all") is, by those same societies, generally seen in in positive light, even when it was imposed on those people.

It has been countered by pointing out that there are multiple examples of non-procreative heterosexual sex (as well as masturbation), such as relations between people past the age of conception, commercial sex, and sex in which birth-control measures are used. {{citation needed}}

And finally, there is a very real question as to how many people the Earth can support. In earlier centuries, few children survived infancy, but current medicine now allows most to lead healthy lives, meaning that fewer pregnancies may be needed. And arguably less procreative sex can relieve population pressures. {{citation needed}}

=== Association with effeminacy in men, and masculinity in women ===
{{main|Gender identity}}
This accusation seems to be based on the generalization that all those who engage in same-sex relations are also gender variant, a contention which is not sustained by research in the field. {{citation needed}}

=== Homosexuality as a sin ===
{{main|Religion and homosexuality}}
[[Image:20051129 northlake-il5.jpg|frame|An extreme example of an anti-gay slogan. While other Christians may refer to [[Leviticus 18|homosexual acts]] as "an [[Abomination (Bible)|abomination]] before God", [[Westboro Baptist Church]] is the primary "church" that uses this slogan. ]]
A number of Christians interpret Biblical texts to imply that same-sex sexual intercourse is [[sin|sinful]].  Many [[mainline]] churches are very divided over the issue of [[same-sex marriage]] and religious [[blessing of same sex unions]] where they can bless same-sex love but not same sex sex acts. These individuals and congregations believe that such sexual acts as [[anal sex]] and or [[oral sex]] are forms of [[sexual immorality]] that should be advised against.  One slogan commonly heard is "love the sinner and not the sin."  Other congregations, including the [[metropolitan Community Church]]es, commonly affirm homosexuality and believe that neither homosexuality or homosexual sex acts are a sin.{{fact}} Some conservative churches reject the idea of a homosexual orientation and view homosexuality as being an urge towards sinful homosexual behavior and thus something everyone may experience from time to time. Many slogans, including some listed in the next section, have been used by [[religion and homosexuality|religious opponents of homosexuality]], particularly by [[Fred Phelps|Rev. Fred Phelps]], founder of the [[westboro Baptist Church|godhatesfags.com]] website and [[Westboro Baptist Church]]. These controversial slogans have included "God Hates Fags", "Fear God Not Fags", and "[[Matthew Shepard]] Burns In Hell" &lt;ref&gt;Dunn, Katia. "What If God Were Gay?". Portland Mercury. [http://web.archive.org/web/20050310064914/http://portlandmercury.com/2000-09-14/city.html]&lt;/ref&gt;. Another slogan is "God made [[Adam and Eve]], not Adam and Steve".

=== AIDS as a gay disease ===

:''Related article: [[Homosexuality and medical science]]''

A common theme of anti-gay slogans is that [[AIDS]] is a gay disease which is somehow deserved. One example is the [[slogan]] "AIDS Kills Fags Dead" (''[[Faggot (epithet)|fag]]'' being a pejorative term for a male homosexual).

&lt;div style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; text-align: center;"&gt;[[Image:AdParody-anti-gaySlogan.png]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;''Anti-gay &lt;br&gt;[[Advertising slogan|slogan]] [[parody]] ''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''c. 1990''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The "AIDS Kills Fags Dead" slogan is a [[parody]] of the [[advertising slogan]] "[[Raid bug spray|Raid]]: [[Kills Bugs Dead]]", the tagline used in [[television advertising]] for the [[SC Johnson]] [[insecticide]]. It thus implicitly identifies gay men with vermin fit for extermination.

The slogan appeared during the early years of [[AIDS]] in the United States, when the disease was mainly diagnosed among male homosexuals and was almost invariably fatal. The slogan caught on quickly as a catchy [[truism]], a [[chant]], or simply something written as [[graffiti]].

It is reported that the slogan first appeared in public in the early [[1990s]], when [[Sebastian Bach]], lead singer of the [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Skid Row (heavy metal band)|Skid Row]], wore it on a [[t-shirt]]. &lt;ref&gt;Michael Musto. "La Dolce Musto", village voice, 2000. http://www.villagevoice.com/nyclife/0022,musto,15284,15.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase has been used by [[religion and homosexuality|religious opponents of homosexuality]]. It was for example seen in [[1998]] at the funeral of [[Matthew Shepard]], a victim of anti-gay violence (whose death was not AIDS related, he was beaten to death), when a group led by [[Fred Phelps]] of the [[Westboro Baptist Church]] staged a protest.

A variant of this is "AIDS cures fags", a role reversal which makes homosexuality the disease and the inevitable death from AIDS the "cure".

Recent studies from the [[Center for Disease Control]] show that among males in the United States a high proportion are likely to have contracted the condition through homosexual sex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hab.hrsa.gov/history/fact2005/men_with_men_and_hivaids.htm HRSA fact sheets: Men Who Have Sex With Men and HIV/AIDS]. The proportions vary between ethnicities: [http://hab.hrsa.gov/history/fact2005/hispanics_and_hivaids.htm HRSA fact sheets: Hispanics and HIV/AIDS]&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, however, the epidemic has touched primarily people enagaged in opposite-sex behaviors, and medical evidence indicates the disease is propagated not because the sex of the partner is the same as one's own, but as a factor of unhygienic sexual behaviors (such as relations with multiple partners concurrent with an absence of protective techniques). And the Large numbers of straight women who are HIV Positive who were monogamous to their husbands but were infected by their husbands due to their husbands infidelity or IV drug use
