'''Anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric''' are themes, [[catchphrase]]s, and [[slogan]]s that have been used against [[homosexuality]] or other [[non-heterosexual]] [[sexual orientation]]s in order to demean [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) people. They range from the demeaning and the pejorative to expressions of hostility towards [[homosexuality and religion|homosexuality which are based on religious]], medical, or moral grounds. It is a form of [[hate speech]]&lt;ref name="FRA"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/1226-Factsheet-homophobia-hate-speech-crime_EN.pdf | title=Hate Speech and Hate Crimes against LGBT Persons | publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights | date=2009 | access-date=20 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ILGA-Europe"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ilga-europe.org/what-we-do/our-advocacy-work/hate-crime-hate-speech | title=Hate crime &amp; hate speech | publisher=ILGA-Europe | access-date=20 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is illegal in countries such as the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/lag-om-hets-mot-folkgrupp-innefattar-homosexuella|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120724173853/http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/lag-om-hets-mot-folkgrupp-innefattar-homosexuella|title=Lag om hets mot folkgrupp innefattar homosexuella - DN.SE|date=24 July 2012|archive-date=24 July 2012|newspaper=Dagens Nyheter|access-date=20 June 2019|last1=Morén|first1=Kristoffer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric often consists of [[moral panic]] and/or [[conspiracy theory]]. In Eastern Europe, these conspiracy theories are based on earlier [[antisemitic conspiracy theories]] and posit that the LGBT movement is an instrument of foreign control and domination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Herdt |first1=Gilbert |title=Moral Panics, Sex Panics: Fear and the Fight Over Sexual Rights |date=June 2009 |publisher=NYU Press |isbn=978-0-8147-3723-1 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klosowska |first1=Anna |editor1-last=Sierra |editor1-first=M. |editor2-last=Román-Odio |editor2-first=C. |title=Transnational Borderlands in Women's Global Networks: The Making of Cultural Resistance |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-230-11947-5 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vatfAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT185 |language=en |chapter=Trouble in the Global Village: A Snapshot of LGBT Community in Eastern Europe|date=6 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sherry |first1=Michael S. |title=Gay Artists in Modern American Culture: An Imagined Conspiracy |date=2007 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |isbn=978-0-8078-8589-5 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-gay rhetoric==
Anti-gay activists claim that homosexuality goes against traditional [[family values]], or that homosexuality is a [[Trojan Horse]], or that it "destroys families" and humankind&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/ahead-of-olympics-russia-raises-anti-lgbt-rhetoric-1.1562570 |title=Russia raises anti-LGBT rhetoric at home while softening message to West &amp;#124; CTV News |publisher=Ctvnews.ca |date=2013-11-27 |access-date=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; through [[homosexual recruitment]] which will lead to the extinction of humanity.

===Causing disasters===
The argument that homosexuals cause [[natural disasters]] has been around for more than a thousand years, even before [[Justinian]] blamed earthquakes on "unchecked homosexual behavior" in the sixth century.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dynes |first1=Wayne R. |title=Encyclopedia of Homosexuality: Volume II |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-36812-0 |page=870 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g7TOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT120 |chapter=Myths &amp; Fabrications|date=22 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This trope was common in [[early modern]] Christian literature;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Greenberg |first1=David F. |title=The Construction of Homosexuality |date=15 August 1990 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-30628-5 |page=168 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RKhFRgR-1awC&amp;pg=PA168 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; homosexuals were blamed for earthquakes, floods, famines, plagues, invasions of [[Saracens]], and field mice. This discourse was revived by [[Anita Bryant]] in 1976 when she blamed homosexuals for droughts in California.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt; In the US, right-wing religious groups including the [[Westboro Baptist Church]] continue to claim that homosexuals are responsible for disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dominey-Howes |first1=Dale |last2=Gorman-Murray |first2=Andrew |last3=McKinnon |first3=Scott |title=Queering disasters: on the need to account for LGBTI experiences in natural disaster contexts |journal=Gender, Place &amp; Culture |date=2014 |volume=21 |issue=7 |pages=905–918 |doi=10.1080/0966369X.2013.802673|s2cid=146478126 |url=https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/21638 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexuals have been blamed for hurricanes, including [[Hurricane Isaac|Isaac]], [[Hurricane Katrina |Katrina]], and [[Hurricane Sandy|Sandy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dowling |first1=Tim |title=Superstorm Sandy and many more disasters that have been blamed on the gay community |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2012/oct/30/hurricane-sandy-disasters-blamed-gay-community |access-date=24 August 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2020, various religious figures including Israeli rabbi [[Meir Mazuz]] have argued that the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] is divine retribution for same-sex activity or [[pride parades]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Religious figures blame LGBT+ people for coronavirus |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-lgbt/religious-figures-blame-lgbt-people-for-coronavirus-idUSKBN20W2HL |access-date=24 August 2020 |work=Reuters |date=9 March 2020 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverend [[Jerry Falwell]] blamed homosexuals (among others) for indirectly causing the [[September 2001 attacks]] by provoking the aggression of [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalists]] and causing God to withdraw his protection for America. On the broadcast of the Christian television program ''[[The 700 Club]]'', Falwell said, "You helped this happen." He later clarified that "I would never blame any human being except the terrorists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/14/Falwell.apology/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330131939/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/14/Falwell.apology/ |archive-date=March 30, 2013 |title=CNN report of Falwell's speech |publisher=Archives.cnn.com |access-date=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Falwell and Robertson Blame Liberal America |url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/falwell-and-above/ |access-date=24 August 2020 |work=Snopes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slogan "AIDS Kills Fags Dead" appeared during the early years of AIDS in the United States, when the disease was mainly diagnosed among male homosexuals and was almost invariably fatal. The slogan caught on quickly as a catchy [[truism]], a [[chant]], or simply something written as [[graffiti]]. It is reported that the slogan first appeared in public in the early 1990s, when [[Sebastian Bach]], the former lead singer of the [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]], wore it on a [[t-shirt]] thrown to him by an audience member.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Musto.

===Homosexual agenda===
{{Main|Homosexual agenda}}

The derogatory term "homosexual agenda" is applied to efforts to change government policies and laws on [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) issues, for example, [[same-sex marriage]] and [[civil unions]], [[LGBT adoption]], recognizing [[Suspect classification|sexual orientation as a protected civil rights minority classification]], [[Sexual orientation and military service|LGBT military participation]], inclusion of [[LGBT history]] and themes in [[public education]], introduction of [[anti-bullying legislation]] to protect LGBT minors—as well as non-governmental campaigns and individual actions that increase visibility and cultural acceptance of LGBT people, relationships, and identities. The term has also been used by some [[social conservatism in the United States|social conservatives]] to describe alleged goals of [[LGBT rights]] activists, such as supposed [[homosexual recruitment|recruitment]] of heterosexuals into a "homosexual lifestyle".&lt;ref name="ref-cluster"&gt;[http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2012/07/09/512916/hate-group-homosexual-activists-try-to-confuse-children-to-build-their-numbers/ Hate Group: 'Homosexual Activists' Try To 'Confuse Children' To 'Build Their Numbers'] ''[[Think Progress]]'' July 9, 2012.

In the [[United States]],  the phrase "the gay agenda" was popularized by a video series produced by the evangelical religious group, Springs of Life Ministries in California, and distributed by many [[Christian Right]] organizations, the first video of which was called ''The Gay Agenda'' and was released in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Herman|first=Didi|title=The Anti-Gay Agenda: Orthodox Vision and the Christian Right|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date= 1998 &lt;!-- (ebook, 2007) --&gt;|isbn=9780226327693|ref={{harvid|Herman|1998}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|81-81}}  In the same year the [[Oregon Citizens Alliance]] (a conservative Christian political activist organization) used this video as part of their campaign for [[Oregon Ballot Measure 9 (1992)|Ballot Measure 9]] to amend the Oregon Constitution to prevent what the OCA called [[special rights]] for gays, [[lesbian]]s, and [[bisexual]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Signorile|first=Michelangelo|year=1993|title=Queer In America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Cameron]]—co-founder of the Institute for the Scientific Investigation of Sexuality in Lincoln, later renamed the [[Family Research Institute]]—appeared in the video, wherein he asserted that 75 percent of gay men regularly ingest [[feces]] and that 70–78 percent have had a [[sexually transmitted disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Herman|1998|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Gay Agenda'' was followed by three other video publications; ''The Gay Agenda in Public Education'' (1993), ''The Gay Agenda: March on Washington'' (1993) and a feature follow-up ''Stonewall: 25 Years of Deception'' (1994). The videos contained interviews with [[LGBT rights opposition|opponents of LGBT rights]], and the series was made available through [[Christian right]] organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Herman|1998|pp=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ugandan bill====

Uganda borrowed from the anti-gay rhetoric and influence of the [[Christian right|American religious right]] to influence public opinion, and eventually persuade parliament to pass the [[Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2014|Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Act]] (previously called the "Kill the Gays bill").

In 2009, a workshop entitled "Seminar on Exposing the Homosexuals' Agenda" was held in Kampala, Uganda organized by the {{as written|reason=Do not link; this is a Uganda organization, not the [[Family Life Network]] in New York State|Family Life Network}}, and led by Ugandan [[Stephen Langa]].&lt;ref name="kaoma-2010"&gt;Kaoma, Kapya (Winter 09/Spring 10).

The workshop featured three American evangelial Christians: [[Scott Lively]], author of several books opposing homosexuality; [[Caleb Lee Brundidge]], an [[ex-gay]] man who conducts sessions to heal homosexuality; and [[Don Schmierer]], a board member of [[Exodus International]], an organization devoted to promoting "freedom from homosexuality through the power of Jesus Christ".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101226032522/http://www.exodusinternational.org/content/category/6/24/57/ About us], Exodus International (2005).

The theme of the conference was the "[[gay agenda]]": the threat posed to Bible-based values and traditional American family. They discussed [[conversion therapy]], how gay men often sodomized teenage boys and how "the gay movement is an evil institution" whose goal is "to defeat the marriage-based society and replace it with a culture of sexual promiscuity".&lt;ref name="gettleman-2010"&gt;Gettleman, Jeffrey (3 January 2010).

According to Ugandan Kappy Kaoma who was in attendance, "[The parliament] feels it is necessary to draft a new law that deals comprehensively with the issue of homosexuality and ...takes into account the international gay agenda. ... Right now there is a proposal that a new law be drafted."&lt;ref name="kaoma-2010" /&gt;

Within a month, the Anti-Homosexuality Bill of 2009 was introduced in Parliament with penalties up to capital punishment. That did not succeed, but by 2013 Parliament passed a law which was then signed into law by President Museveni with penalties up to life imprisonment for "the offense of homosexuality".&lt;ref name="Uganda-Act-2014"&gt;[https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/530c4bc64.pdf Text of the Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2014 as signed into law]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homosexuality as unnatural===
[[File:Park Kosynierow in Poznan (chlopak dziewczyna normalna rodzina).jpg|thumb|Graffiti in [[Poznań]]: "Boy–girl is the normal family"]]
Describing homosexuality as unnatural dates back to [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Thomas Aquinas]]. However, there is no single definition of "unnatural". Some of those who argue that homosexuality is unnatural in the sense of being absent from nature, an argument refuted by the presence of [[homosexuality in animals]]. Others mean that the genitals were created for reproduction (either by God or natural selection) and are not intended to be used for purposes they deem "[[unnatural sex|unnatural]]". Proponents of this idea often argue that homosexuality is immoral because it is unnatural, but opponents argue that this argument is [[is–ought problem|is–ought conflation]]. Some proponents of the "unnaturalness" thesis argue that homosexual behavior is the result of "[[homosexual recruitment|recruitment]]" or willful sinfulness. However, if the [[causes of sexual orientation]] (still a matter of scientific debate) are [[biology and sexual orientation|biological]], this undermines their argument to an extent.&lt;ref name=Hopkins&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hopkins |first1=Patrick D. |title=Queer Philosophy |publisher=Brill {{!}} Rodopi |isbn=978-94-012-0835-2 |pages=1–9 |doi=10.1163/9789401208352_002 |chapter=Naturalizing homosexuality: biology, sexual orientation, and the nature/culture distinction|year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many conservative Christians consider homosexual acts to be inherently sinful based on scriptural passages such as [[Leviticus 18:22]] ("You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination"), [[Leviticus 20:13]] ("If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall be put to death, their blood is upon them"), and [[1 Corinthians 6]]:9–10 ("Do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived! Fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, male prostitutes, sodomites, thieves, the greedy, drunkards, revilers, robbers—none of these will inherit the kingdom of God.")&lt;ref name="Gnuse" /&gt; The story of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], a city that was burned down due to the sins of its inhabitants, is sometimes portrayed as divine retribution for homosexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pitt |first1=Richard N. |title="Killing the Messenger": Religious Black Gay Men's Neutralization of Anti-Gay Religious Messages |journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |date=2010 |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=56–72 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01492.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gnuse&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gnuse |first1=Robert K. |title=Seven Gay Texts: Biblical Passages Used to Condemn Homosexuality |journal=Biblical Theology Bulletin: Journal of Bible and Culture |date=2015 |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=68–87 |doi=10.1177/0146107915577097|s2cid=170127256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various inflammatory and controversial slogans, including some listed in the next section, have been used by opponent congregations and individuals, particularly by [[Fred Phelps]], founder of the [[Westboro Baptist Church]]. These slogans have included "God Hates Fags", "Fear God Not Fags", and "[[Matthew Shepard]] Burns In Hell".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portlandmercury.com/2000-09-14/city.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310064914/http://portlandmercury.com/2000-09-14/city.html |archive-date=2005-03-10 |title=Dunn, Katia.

===As Western ill===

Homosexuality is sometimes claimed to be non-existent in some non-Western countries, or to be an evil influence imported from the West.

Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]] of Malayasia employed anti-gay rhetoric as part of his "Asian values" program, describing homosexuality as one of several Western ills.&lt;ref name="Shah-2017"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shah |first=Shanon |title=The Making of a Gay Muslim: Religion, Sexuality and Identity in Malaysia and Britain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wn86DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA130 |access-date=26 August 2020 |series=Palgrave Studies in Lived Religion and Societal Challenges. |date=17 October 2017 |publisher=Springer International Publishing |location=Cham, Switzerland |isbn=978-3-319-63130-1 |page=130 |oclc=1027079609}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mohamad used it for political advantage in the 1998 scandal involving the sacking and jailing of MP and former [[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Anwar Ibrahim]] by Mohamad amidst accusations of sodomy that the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' termed a "blatantly political fix-up".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Peter |last=Hartcher |title=Outdated political thuggery embarrasses Malaysia |url=https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/outdated-political-thuggery-embarrasses-malaysia-20100222-ornl.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=23 February 2010 |access-date=26 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anwar was subsequently subjected to two trials and sentenced to nine years imprisonment for corruption and sodomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www7.nationalacademies.org/humanrights/Cases/CHR_068423.htm |title=Anwar Ibrahim |date=6 June 2014 |access-date=10 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213034949/http://www7.nationalacademies.org/humanrights/Cases/CHR_068423.htm |archive-date=13 February 2015 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in New York for a meeting of the United Nations, Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] was invited to speak at Columbia University in New York to give a lecture.

====Homintern====
In 1937 the English gay classics scholar Sir [[Maurice Bowra]] referred to himself as part of the "Homintern".&lt;ref&gt;"Bowra, Sir (Cecil) Maurice (1898–1971)" by L. G. Mitchell, [http://www.oxforddnb.com "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are competing claims about who coined the term – including [[Jocelyn Brooke]], [[Harold Norse]] and [[W. H. Auden]]. A takeoff on [[Comintern]] (Communist International), it was meant to convey the idea of a global homosexual community.{{efn|name="Powell-1981"}}{{efn|"The word 'Homintern', which I coined in 1939, is attributed to [[W. H. Auden|Auden]], who used it in an article in the [[Partisan Review]] about 1941, and has passed into the language.

Morrow, 1989, {{ISBN|9780688067045}}, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|"[[Anthony Powell]] suggested that his friend [[Jocelyn Brooke]] invented the term that Harold Nurse tells us Auden stole from him.

Patrick Higgins, Fourth Estate (UK), 1993, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Auden used the term in the ''[[Partisan Review]]'' in 1950, entitling his review of a book on Oscar Wilde: ''"A Playboy of the Western World: St. Oscar, the Homintern Martyr."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Auden |first= W.

"Homintern" was also used by American Senator [[Joe McCarthy]] during the [[McCarthyist]] scare in the 1950s, who used it to claim that the administrations of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Harry S. Truman]] were set on destroying America from within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blumenthal|first1=Max|title=Republican Gomorrah: Inside the Movement that Shattered the Party|date=13 July 2010|publisher=Nation Books|isbn=9781568584171|page=205|edition=reprint|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oa-TsVnbYUIC&amp;pg=PA205|access-date=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts were made to link [[Communism]] and homosexuality, with "homintern" a play on the word "[[Comintern]]" (the short name of the Communist International). But the word was also used ironically by those in favor of gay rights.&lt;ref name=RVOURTA0G/&gt;&lt;ref name=spectator&gt;[https://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/04/from-auden-to-wilde-a-roll-call-of-gay-talent/ "From Auden to Wilde: a roll call of gay talent"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Woods |first1=Gregory |title=Homintern: How Gay Culture Liberated the Modern World |date=2017 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-22874-8 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Homintern'' also appeared in a number of mass-circulation magazine articles during the 1960s - such as ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'', which in 1966 published an article by [[Gene Marine]] about the Homintern. It was also frequently used in the [[American conservatism|conservative]] magazine ''[[National Review]]''. [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]] would warn of the machinations of the Homintern on his TV talk show ''[[Firing Line (TV series)|Firing Line]]'' – feeding the conservative belief that the Homintern deliberately manipulated culture to encourage homosexuality by promoting [[camp (style)|camp]] programs such as the popular 1960s TV series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]''. Such magazine articles were often illustrated with the color lavender and the Homintern was sometimes called "the lavender conspiracy". It was subsequently claimed that there was a secret worldwide network of gay [[art gallery]] owners, ballet directors, [[movie producer]]s, record label executives and photographers who, behind the scenes, determined who would become successful artists, dancers, actors, and models.&lt;ref name=RVOURTA0G&gt;{{cite news | title= A review of "Gay Artists in Modern American Culture An Imagined Conspiracy" by Michael S.

====Homosexual and Gay mafia====
The English critic [[Kenneth Tynan]] wrote to A.C. Spectorsky (editor of ''[[Playboy]]'') in 1967 proposing an article on the "Homosexual Mafia" in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Tynan Letters (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Spectorsky declined, although he admitted that "culture hounds were paying homage to faggotismo as they have never done before" ''Playboy'' would subsequently run a panel on gay issues in April 1971.

"Gay Mafia" became more widely used in the US media in the 1980s and 1990s, such as the American daily The ''[[New York Post]]''. The term was also used by the British [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' in 1998 in response to what it claimed was sinister dominance by gay men in the [[First Blair ministry|Labour Party Cabinet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/sun-rejects-outing-and-sacks-parris-sacks-parris-and-rejects-outing-1184294.html|title='Sun' rejects outing and sacks Parris sacks Parris and rejects outing|work=The Independent|access-date=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/212737.stm|title=BBC News – UK – Sun changes mind over gays|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|access-date=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100407/halltext/100407h0001.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 07 Apr 2010 (pt 0001)|publisher=Publications.parliament.uk|access-date=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/11/news/11iht-brit.t_2.html|title=A 'Gay Mafia' in Whitehall?

{{quote|a bag into which the right wing throws societal changes that do not suit it (eg. calls for equal rights for same-sex couples, which have been implemented in many countries, from the [[same-sex marriage in the United States|United States]] to [[same-sex marriage in South Africa|South Africa]]). In the language of right-wing propaganda... "LGBT ideology" serves to dehumanize minorities and create an enemy - and thus build political support for the right, which presents itself as the only defender of the traditional family, religion and social order. "Ideology" also fits the right-wing perception of the world in terms of a conspiracy - ideology is "promoted", someone disseminates it, someone is "behind it" (eg. [[George Soros]], a Jewish-American financier who supports, among others, LGBT organizations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Adam|last= Leszczyński |title=Intelektualiści prawicy o LGBT: nihilizm, bolszewia, hitleryzm.

W języku propagandy prawicowej, jak pisał w OKO.press Stanisław Krawczyk, „ideologia LGBT” służy odczłowieczaniu mniejszości oraz kreowaniu wroga — a więc budowaniu politycznego poparcia dla prawicy, która przedstawia się jako jedyna obrończyni tradycyjnej rodziny, religii i ładu społecznego. „Ideologia” pasuje także do częstego na prawicy postrzegania świata w kategoriach spisku — ideologię ktoś „promuje”, ktoś upowszechnia, ktoś „za nią stoi” (np. George Soros, żydowsko–amerykański finansista, wspierający m.in. organizacje LGBT).}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Misgendering ===
{{Further info|Misgendering}}{{See also|Deadnaming}}

Misgendering is the act of labelling others with a gender that does not match their gender identity.&lt;ref name="Serano2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julia Serano|title=Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fR5ji5h5g1MC|date=20 May 2009|publisher=Seal Press|isbn=978-0-7867-4791-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misgendering can be deliberate or accidental. It ordinarily takes the form of a person using pronouns to describe someone that are not the ones they use,{{citation needed |reason=Original url imported from [[Transphobia]] triggered SPS edit filter for AuthorHouse ('Transgender Explained For Those Who Are Not'; Herman; 2009) |date=August 2020}}&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Transgender Employment Experiences: Gendered Perceptions and the Law|last = Bender-Baird|first = Kyla|publisher = SUNY Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-1438436746|pages = 5–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling a person "ma'am" or "sir" in contradiction to the person's gender identity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Looking Queer: Body Image and Identity in Lesbian, Bisexual, Gay, and Transgender Communities (Haworth Gay &amp; Lesbian Studies)|last = DeCecco|first = John|publisher = Routledge|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0789004635|location = New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a pre-transition name for someone instead of a post-transition one,&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; called "[[deadnaming]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Meredith Ramirez |last=Talusan |title=What 'deadnaming' means, and why you shouldn't do it to Caitlyn Jenner |work=Fusion |date=June 4, 2015 |url=http://fusion.net/story/144324/what-deadnaming-means-and-why-you-shouldnt-do-it-to-caitlyn-jenner/ |access-date=2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fae|first1=Jane|title=Changing your name should be a joyous moment, but for many it's a nightmare|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/19/changing-your-name-nightmare-trans|website=Comment is Free|access-date=8 July 2015|date=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deception and masquerade ===

Some transphobic slurs such as ''[[shemale]], trap,'' and ''ladyboy'' capitalize on the idea that [[Trans woman|trans women]] are men masquerading as women. The concept of a person identifying to a gender that does not correspond with their physical sex identity has often been twisted into jokes about how repulsive such a person must be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How I Learned to Hate Transgender People|url = http://magazine.good.is/articles/how-i-learned-to-hate-transgender-people|access-date = 2015-05-05|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150505055005/http://magazine.good.is/articles/how-i-learned-to-hate-transgender-people|archive-date = 2015-05-05|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to a growing push for [[Bathroom bills|anti-discrimination bills regarding public restrooms]], Former Arkansas Gov. [[Mike Huckabee]] delivered this message to a [[National Religious Broadcasters|National Religious Broadcasters Convention]] during his [[Mike Huckabee presidential campaign, 2016|2016 bid for the presidency]]:{{Quote|text = We are now in city after city watching ordinances say that your seven-year-old daughter, if she goes into the restroom cannot be offended, and you can't be offended, if she's greeted there by a 42-year-old man who feels more like a woman than he does a man. Now I wish that someone told me that when I was in high school that I could have felt like a woman when it came time to take showers in PE. I'm pretty sure that I would have found my feminine side and said, ‘Coach, I think I'd rather shower with the girls today.’|sign = |source = }}Huckabee goes on to say, “that there is something inherently wrong about forcing little children to be a part of this social experiment." Huckabee's joke prompted backlash from LGBT leaders, including Rebecca Issacs, the executive director of [[Equality Federation]], who said in an email to ''[[The Huffington Post]]'': "Everyone needs to use the restroom and everyone cares about safety and privacy. Mr. Huckabee's comments contribute to a climate in which, despite recent gains in visibility, transgender people continue to face extraordinarily high rates of discrimination and violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/02/mike-huckabee-lgbt-bathrooms_n_7494514.html|title = Mike Huckabee Belittled Transgender People In February Speech|last = Levine|first = Sam|date = 2 June 2015|work = The Huffington Post|access-date = 7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, conservative group [[Campaign for Houston]] released an advertisement targeting [[Houston, Texas Proposition 1, 2015|Houston Proposition 1]], an anti-discriminatory bill that would protect transgender peoples' rights to use bathrooms that align with their [[gender identity]]. The video, which implies the sexual assault of a young girl, was decried as "the definition of transphobia" by J. Brian Lowder, an associate editor for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' and author for its LGBTQ section.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2015/10/19/hero_trans_bathroom_battle_campaign_for_houston_ad_is_most_transphobic_yet.html|title = This Anti-HERO Ad Is the Definition of Transphobia|last = Lowder|first = J.

=== In feminism ===

Some positions within feminist theory have used denialist rhetoric viewed as transphobic.

In 1979, American radical feminist Janice Raymond published  ''[[The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male]]''. In it, she wrote that,  "All transsexuals rape women's bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves."&lt;ref name=Raymond-1979&gt;{{cite book |last=Raymond |first=Janice G. |title=The transsexual empire |publisher=Beacon Press |location=Boston, Massachusetts |year=1979 |isbn=9780807021644 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed |date=August 2020}} A common position in radical feminism maintain that trans women are not women in a literal sense and should not be in women-only spaces.&lt;ref name="Goldberg"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Goldberg |first1=Michelle |author-link=Michelle Goldberg |title=What Is a Woman? |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |date=August 4, 2014 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/04/woman-2 |issn=0028-792X |oclc=320541675 |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |access-date=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave feminists]] perceive trans men and women respectively as "traitors" and "infiltrators" to womanhood.&lt;ref name="Erickson-Schroth 2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erickson-Schroth |first1=Laura |title=Trans Bodies, Trans Selves: A Resource for the Transgender Community |date=2014-05-12 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0199325351 |pages=568–569 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Ef1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA568|quote=Some feminists have perceived transmasculine people as traitors—that is, as women who identify politically with men. When inclusive of trans men, these feminists have  often gendered them as women.  Conversely, these feminists have tended to  perceive transfeminine people as infiltrators of womanhood and of women's space.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1997 article British lesbian feminist [[Sheila Jeffreys]] wrote that {{nobr|"[T]ranssexualism}} should be seen as a violation of human rights." Jeffreys also argued that by [[Transition (transgender)|transitioning]] medically and socially, trans women are "constructing a conservative fantasy of what women should be. They are inventing an essence of womanhood which is deeply insulting and restrictive."&lt;ref name="Jeffreys-1997"&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Journal of Lesbian Studies |last=Jeffreys |first=Sheila |title=Transgender activism: a lesbian feminist perspective |volume=1 |issue=3–4 |pages=55–74 |doi=10.1300/J155v01n03_03 |date=May 1997  }} [http://www.rapereliefshelter.bc.ca/sites/default/files/imce/Transgender%20Activism%20A%20Lesbian%20Feminist%20Perspective%20by%20Sheila%20Jeffreys%2C%20Journal%20of%20Lesbian%20Studies%201997%5B1%5D.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
According to one study, "homophobic epithets foster dehumanization and avoidance of gay people, in ways that other insults or labels do not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fasoli |first1=Fabio |last2=Paladino |first2=Maria Paola |last3=Carnaghi |first3=Andrea |last4=Jetten |first4=Jolanda |last5=Bastian |first5=Brock |last6=Bain |first6=Paul G. |title=Not "just words": Exposure to homophobic epithets leads to dehumanizing and physical distancing from gay men: Homophobic epithets and dehumanization |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |date=2016 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=237–248 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.2148|url=https://eprints.qut.edu.au/90602/11/EJSP_dehumanization_uncorrected.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that homophobia "results in substantial health and welfare effects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Plummer |first1=David |title=Homophobia and health: Unjust, anti-social, harmful and endemic |journal=Health Care Analysis |date=1995 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=150–156 |doi=10.1007/BF02198224|pmid=10143359 |s2cid=34638623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Legality and censorship==
[[Hate speech]] against LGBT people, or incitement to hatred against them, is criminalized in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hate crime &amp; hate speech |url=https://www.ilga-europe.org/what-we-do/our-advocacy-work/hate-crime-hate-speech |website=[[ILGA-Europe]] |access-date=22 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
