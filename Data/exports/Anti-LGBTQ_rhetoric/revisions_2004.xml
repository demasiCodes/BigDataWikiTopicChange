They have been increasingly prevalent since the [[1980s]], and range from disrespectful, denigrating and pejorative [[slogan]]s, to those expressing antipathy on [[religion and homosexuality|religious grounds]] or moral grounds. They commonly use pejorative terms like "[[fag]]" or "[[faggot]]". [[Godhatesfags.com]] is a prime example.

In political use, anti-gay slogans are commonly used to convey the varied cases against homosexuality. They reflect the spectrum of opinion among those who oppose homosexuality and [[gay rights]]. Many are considered [[homophobic hate speech]] by those who accept the concept of [[hate speech]].

== Themes ==
The basic themes of anti-gay slogans are based on various claims:
* [[AIDS]] is a gay [[disease]]
* [[religion and homosexuality|Homosexuality is a sin]]
* Homosexuals "recruit" children
* Homosexuality as a [[sexual perversion]]
* [[AIDS]] is divine retribution towards homosexuals (a [[plague]])

=== AIDS as a gay disease ===
''Related article'': [[homosexuality and medical science]]

A common theme of anti-gay slogans is that [[AIDS]] is a gay disease which is somehow deserved. One example is the [[slogan]] "AIDS Kills Fags Dead" (''[[fag]]'' being a pejorative term for a male homosexual). 

&lt;div style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; text-align: center;"&gt;[[Image:AdParody-anti-gaySlogan.png]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;''Anti-gay &lt;br&gt;[[Advertising slogan|slogan]] [[parody]] ''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''c. 1990''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The "AIDS Kills Fags Dead" slogan is a [[parody]] of the [[advertising slogan]] "[[Raid bug spray|Raid]]: [[Kills Bugs Dead]]", the tagline used in [[television advertising]] for the [[SC Johnson]] [[insecticide]]. It thus implicitly identifies gay men with vermin fit for extermination.

The slogan appeared during the early years of [[AIDS]] in the United States, when the disease was mainly diagnosed among male homosexuals and was almost invariably fatal. The slogan caught on quickly as a catchy [[truism]], a [[chant]], or simply something written as [[graffiti]].

It is reputed that the slogan first appeared in public in the early [[1990s]], when [[Sebastian Bach]], lead singer of the [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Skid Row]], wore it on a [[t-shirt]]. Some sources say this happened during a concert; others claim it was in a magazine photo shoot. No photograph has surfaced for either claim, and there is certainly no way of knowing if [[Sebastian Bach]] was the first, or merely the most popular, proponent of the saying.

At first, Mr. Bach joked about it on [[MTV]], but he later apologized, claiming that he had many gay friends. He said that while he thought it was funny at the time, that it was comparably upsetting to someone else wearing a "Cancer kills grandmas dead" T-shirt—his grandmother had died of [[cancer]]. For years afterward he wore an "AIDS Kills Everyone" t-shirt, after being confronted by his friend, the designer [[Michael Schmidt]]. Bach's website does not mention the episode.

The phrase has been used by [[religion and homosexuality|religious opponents of homosexuality]]. It was for example seen in [[1998]] at the funeral of [[Matthew Shepard]], a victim of anti-gay violence, when a group led by [[Fred Phelps|Rev. Fred Phelps]] of the [[Westboro Baptist Church]] staged a protest.

A variant of this is "AIDS cures fags", a role reversal which makes homosexuality the disease and the inevitable death from AIDS the "cure".

=== Homosexuality as a sin ===

Many slogans, including the above, have been used by [[religion and homosexuality|religious opponents of homosexuality]], particularly by Phelps. These have included "God Hates Fags", "Fear God Not Fags", and "[[Matthew Shepard]] Burns In Hell" [http://www.portlandmercury.com/2000-09-14/city.html]. Another slogan is "God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve."

=== "''Recruitment''" ===

Another common theme is that homosexuals are somehow predatory on children, or are "recruiting" in secret. A common slogan is "Homosexuals cannot reproduce &amp;#8212; so they must recruit." or its variants.
