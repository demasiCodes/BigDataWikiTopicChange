'''LGBT''' is an [[acronym and initialism|initialism]] that collectively refers to the ''[[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[transgender]]'' community. In use since the 1990s, the term ''LGBT'' is an adaptation of the initialism "'''LGB'''", which itself started replacing the phrase ''gay community'' beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;Acronyms, initialisms &amp; abbreviations dictionary, Volume 1, Part 1uu

The term LGBT is intended to emphasize a diversity of [[sexuality and gender identity-based cultures]] and is sometimes used to refer to anyone who is [[non-heterosexual]] or [[cisgender]] instead of exclusively to people who are [[homosexual]], bisexual, or transgender.&lt;ref name="Gay Pride Nee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Handbook of Lesb"/&gt;

{{further|Terminology of homosexuality}}
Before the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s, there was no common non-derogatory vocabulary for [[Non-heterosexuals|non-heterosexuality]]; the closest such term, "[[third gender]]", traces back to the 1860s but never gained wide acceptance in the United States.&lt;ref name="The Social Studies C"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Hubert C. (1980) ''The "third sex" theory of Karl Heinrich Ulrichs'', Journal of Homosexuality. 1980–1981 Fall–Winter; 6(1–2): pp. 103–1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Magnus Hirschfeld|Hirschfeld, Magnus]], 1904. ''Berlins Drittes Geschlecht'' ("Berlin's Third Sex")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Havelock Ellis|Ellis, Havelock]] and [[John Addington Symonds|Symonds, J. A.]], 1897. ''Sexual Inversion''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Carpenter|Carpenter, Edward]], 1908. ''[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/carpenter-is.html The Intermediate Sex: A Study of Some Transitional Types of Men and Women]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duc, Aimée, 1901. ''Sind es Frauen? Roman über das dritte Geschlecht'' ("Are These Women? Novel about the Third Sex")&lt;/ref&gt;

The first widely used term, ''[[homosexual]]'', was thought to carry negative connotations and tended to be replaced by ''[[homophile]]'' in the 1950s and 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Minton |first=Henry |title=Departing from Deviance |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-226-53043-4 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=cCoADHpbzHsC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;%7cpg=PA238 |accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently ''[[gay]]'' in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="The Social Studies C"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=E.

''Gender and Society'', '''8''', (3) p. 424–443.&lt;/ref&gt; As equality was a priority for [[lesbian feminism|lesbian feminists]], disparity of roles between men and women or [[butch and femme]] were viewed as patriarchal. Lesbian feminists eschewed [[gender role]] play that had been pervasive in bars, as well as the perceived chauvinism of gay men; many lesbian feminists refused to work with gay men, or take up their causes.&lt;ref&gt;Faderman, Lillian (1991). ''Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life in Twentieth Century America'', Penguin Books. ISBN 0-14-017122-3, p. 210–211.&lt;/ref&gt; Lesbians who held a more [[essentialist]] view that they had been born homosexual and used the descriptor "lesbian" to define sexual attraction, often considered the separatist, angry opinions of lesbian-feminists to be detrimental to the cause of gay rights.&lt;ref&gt;Faderman (1991), p. 217–218.&lt;/ref&gt; This was soon followed by bisexual and transgender people also seeking recognition as legitimate categories within the larger community.&lt;ref name="Gay Pride Nee"/&gt; After the initial euphoria of the [[Stonewall riots]] wore off, starting in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, there was a change in perception; some gays and lesbians became less accepting of [[bisexual]] or [[transgender]] people.&lt;ref name="Transgender Subjectivities"&gt;{{cite book |last=Leli |first=Ubaldo |coauthors=Jack Drescher |title=Transgender Subjectivities: A Clinician's Guide |publisher=Haworth Press |date=2005, ISBN 0-7890-2576-0

The initialism LGBT saw occasional use in the United States from about 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ch/books?ei=PW9JTfOeOtPd4AbR54SjDA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=PiglAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22An+Examination+of+the+Family-School+Relationship%22&amp;q=LGBT#search_anchor Research, policy and practice: Annual meeting], American Educational Research Association Verlag AERA, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
Not until the 1990s did it become common to speak of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people with equal respect within the movement.&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/&gt;
Although the LGBT community has seen much controversy regarding universal acceptance of different member groups (bisexual and transgender individuals, in particular, have sometimes been marginalized by the larger LGBT community), the term LGBT has been a positive symbol of inclusion.&lt;ref name="The Handbook of Lesb"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shankle |first=Michael D.

The initial '''A''' for '''''A'''llies'' came from some of the [[paraphilia]] or [[sexual fetishism]] lifestyles, who are primarily in support of the GLBT community, and sometimes they form an alliance in sociopolitical affairs to further represent the umbrella term '''GLBTA''' ('''G'''ay '''L'''esbian '''B'''i '''T'''rans '''A'''lternative or '''A'''llies). {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[File:Were a gay and happy family wagon.jpg|thumb|LGBT families, like these in a 2007 [[pride parade]], are unlikely to label themselves ''[[non-heterosexual]]'' although researchers do so for a variety of reasons.&lt;ref name="The Spectre of Promiscuity"&gt;{{cite book | last = Klesse | first = Christian | title= The Spectre of Promiscuity: Gay Male and Bisexual Non-Monogamies and Polyamories | publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. | isbn = 0-7546-4906-7 | year= 2007 | url =http://books.google.com/books?id=_UR77Hw2WLYC | accessdate=2008-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A reverse to the above situations is evident in the belief of "lesbian &amp;#x26; gay separatism" (not to be confused with the related "[[lesbian separatism]]"), which holds that lesbians and gay men form (or should form) a community distinct and separate from other groups normally included in the LGBTQ sphere.&lt;ref name="In-Between Bodies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gays/Justice"&gt;{{cite book
