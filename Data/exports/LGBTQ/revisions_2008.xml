Before the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s, there was no common non-derogatory vocabulary for [[Non-heterosexuals|non-heterosexuality]]; the closest such term, ''[[third gender]]'', traces back to the 1860s but never gained wide acceptance.&lt;ref name="The Social Studies C"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Hubert C.

Roman über das dritte Geschlecht'' ("Are These Women? Novel about the Third Sex")&lt;/ref&gt;

The first term used, ''[[homosexual]]'', was thought to carry negative connotations and tended to be replaced by ''[[homophile]]'' and then ''[[gay]]''.&lt;ref name="The Social Studies C"&gt;{{cite web

Other gay people also do not care for the term as the lettering comes across as being overly "[[Political correctness|politically correct]]", or as an attempt to [[Categorization|categorize]] the various groups of people into one [[grey area]] word.&lt;ref name="Coming Out in Christi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="It's Your World"/&gt; Another concern is that ''LGBT'' may imply that the issues and priorities of the main groups represented are given equal consideration.&lt;ref name="Coming Out in Christi"/&gt;

There are also some lesbian, gay and bisexual and transgender people as well as [[ontology|ontologists]] who are against an "LGBT community" or "LGB community".&lt;ref name="In-Between Bodies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="That's Revolting"&gt;{{cite web
