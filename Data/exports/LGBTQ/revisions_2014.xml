'''LGBT''' is an [[initialism]] that stands for [[lesbian|'''l'''esbian]], [[gay|'''g'''ay]], [[bisexuality|'''b'''isexual]], and [[transgender|'''t'''ransgender]]. In use since the 1990s, the term is an adaptation of the initialism '''LGB''', which itself started replacing the term ''gay'' when in reference to the [[LGBT community]] beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;Acronyms, initialisms &amp; abbreviations dictionary, Volume 1, Part 1uu

The initialism LGBT is intended to emphasize a diversity of sexuality and gender identity-based cultures and is sometimes used to refer to anyone who is [[non-heterosexual]] or non-[[cisgender]] instead of exclusively to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.&lt;ref name="Gay Pride Nee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Handbook of Lesb"/&gt; To recognize this inclusion, a popular variant adds the letter Q for those who identify as [[queer]] and/or are [[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]] their sexual identity as LGBTQ, recorded since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rkUEAQAAIAAJ |title=The Santa Cruz County in-queery, Volume 9, Santa Cruz Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgendered Community Center, 1996 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2008-11-01 |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the one hand, some [[intersex]] people who want to be included in LGBT groups suggest an extended initialism ''LGBTI'' (recorded since 1999&lt;ref&gt;William L. Maurice, Marjorie A. Bowman, [http://books.google.com/books?id=HX9HAAAAMAAJ Sexual medicine in primary care], Mosby Year Book, 1999, ISBN 978-0-8151-2797-0&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="Challenging Lesbian Nor"/&gt;

Whether or not LGBT people openly identify themselves may depend on whether they live in a discriminatory environment, as well as on the status of [[LGBT rights]] where they live.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Gay_and_lesbian_issues_discrimination&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Terminology of homosexuality}}
Before the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s, there was no common non-derogatory vocabulary for [[Non-heterosexuals|non-heterosexuality]]; the closest such term, ''[[third gender]]'', traces back to the 1860s but never gained wide acceptance in the United States.&lt;ref name="The Social Studies C"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Hubert C. (1980) ''The "third sex" theory of Karl Heinrich Ulrichs'', Journal of Homosexuality. 1980–1981 Fall–Winter; 6(1–2): pp. 103–1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Magnus Hirschfeld|Hirschfeld, Magnus]], 1904. ''Berlins Drittes Geschlecht'' ("Berlin's Third Sex")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Havelock Ellis|Ellis, Havelock]] and [[John Addington Symonds|Symonds, J. A.]], 1897. ''Sexual Inversion''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Carpenter|Carpenter, Edward]], 1908. ''[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/carpenter-is.html The Intermediate Sex: A Study of Some Transitional Types of Men and Women]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duc, Aimée, 1901. ''Sind es Frauen? Roman über das dritte Geschlecht'' ("Are These Women? Novel about the Third Sex")&lt;/ref&gt;

The first widely used term, ''[[homosexual]]'', originally carried negative connotations and tended to be replaced by ''[[homophile]]'' in the 1950s and 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Minton |first=Henry |title=Departing from Deviance |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-226-53043-4 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=cCoADHpbzHsC&amp;pg=PA238 |accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently ''[[gay]]'' in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="The Social Studies C"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=E.

"From Accommodation to Liberation: A Social Movement Analysis of Lesbians in the Homophile Movement." ''Gender and Society'', '''8''', (3) p. 424–443.&lt;/ref&gt; As equality was a priority for [[lesbian feminism|lesbian feminists]], disparity of roles between men and women or [[butch and femme]] were viewed as patriarchal. Lesbian feminists eschewed [[gender role]] play that had been pervasive in bars, as well as the perceived chauvinism of gay men; many lesbian feminists refused to work with gay men, or take up their causes.&lt;ref&gt;Faderman, Lillian (1991). ''Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life in Twentieth Century America'', Penguin Books. ISBN 0-14-017122-3, p. 210–211.&lt;/ref&gt; Lesbians who held a more [[essentialist]] view that they had been born homosexual and used the descriptor "lesbian" to define sexual attraction, often considered the separatist, angry opinions of lesbian-feminists to be detrimental to the cause of gay rights.&lt;ref&gt;Faderman (1991), p. 217–218.&lt;/ref&gt; This was soon followed by bisexual and transgender people also seeking recognition as legitimate categories within the larger community.&lt;ref name="Gay Pride Nee"/&gt;

After the initial euphoria of the [[Stonewall riots]] wore off, starting in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, there was a change in perception; some gays and lesbians became less accepting of [[bisexual]] or [[transgender]] people.&lt;ref name="Transgender Subjectivities"&gt;{{cite book |last=Leli |first=Ubaldo |first2=Jack | last2=Drescher |title=Transgender Subjectivities: A Clinician's Guide |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2005|isbn= 0-7890-2576-0|url =http://books.google.com/books?id=QiJryCzrZmYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"&gt;{{cite book |last=Alexander |first= Jonathan |first2=Karen |last2=Yescavage |title= Bisexuality and Transgenderism: InterSEXions of The Others |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2004|isbn= 1-56023-287-0 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2SOe4igsrbgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was thought that transgender people were acting out [[stereotypes]] and bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were afraid to [[coming out|come out]] and be honest about their identity.&lt;ref name="Transgender Subjectivities"/&gt; Each community that is collectively included has struggled to develop its own identity including whether, and how, to align with other [[gender]] and sexuality-based communities at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day.&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/&gt;

The initialism LGBT saw occasional use in the United States from about 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?ei=PW9JTfOeOtPd4AbR54SjDA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=PiglAQAAIAAJ Research, policy and practice: Annual meeting], American Educational Research Association Verlag AERA, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Not until the 1990s did it become common to speak of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people with equal respect within the movement.&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/&gt; Although the LGBT community has seen much controversy regarding universal acceptance of different member groups (bisexual and transgender individuals, in particular, have sometimes been marginalized by the larger LGBT community), the term ''LGBT'' has been a positive symbol of inclusion.&lt;ref name="The Handbook of Lesb"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shankle |first=Michael D. |title=The Handbook of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Public Health: A Practitioner's Guide To Service |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2006|isbn= 1-56023-496-2 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pUUyLSKD5voC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/&gt; Despite the fact that ''LGBT'' does not nominally encompass all individuals in smaller communities (see Variants below), the term is generally accepted to include those not identified in the four-letter initialism.&lt;ref name="The Handbook of Lesb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/&gt; Overall, the use of the term ''LGBT'' has, over time, largely aided in bringing otherwise marginalized individuals into the general community.&lt;ref name="The Handbook of Lesb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/&gt;

Transgender actress [[Candis Cayne]] in 2009 called the LGBT community "the last great minority", noting that "We can still be harassed openly" and be "called out on television."&lt;ref name="Advocate 2009-03"&gt;{{cite news|title=I Advocate...|date=March 2009|work=[[The Advocate]]|publisher=Issue #1024|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to years of lobbying from users and LGBT groups to eliminate discrimination, the online social networking service [[Facebook]], in February 2014, widened its gender variants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/13/transgender-facebook-expands-gender-options |title=Facebook expands gender options: transgender activists hail 'big advance' | date=14 February 2014 |work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/02/14/confused-by-facebooks-new-gender-options-heres-what-they-mean/ |title=Confused by Facebook’s new gender options?

The initialism LGBTTQQIAAP (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Transsexual, Queer, Questioning, Intersex, Asexual, Ally, Panssexual) has also resulted, although such initialisms are sometimes criticized for being confusing and leaving some people out, as well as issues of placement of the letters within the new title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pugetsoundoff.org/blog/lgbtqqiaap-alphabet-soup-101|title=LGBTQQIAAP - "Alphabet Soup 101" - PugetSoundOff.org|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chattercrow.tumblr.com/post/83331930549/i-cant-use-lgbt-lgbtq-lgbtqia-etc-because|title=actual real life moth, i can’t use LGBT, LGBTQ, LGBTQIA, etc. because...|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mic.com/articles/28093/lgbtqia-a-beginner-s-guide-to-the-great-alphabet-soup-of-queer-identity|title=LGBTQIA: A Beginner’s Guide to the Great Alphabet Soup Of Queer Identity|author=Mic|work=Mic|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the acronym QUILTBAG (Queer and Questioning, Intersex, Lesbian, Transgender and Transsexual and Two-Spirit, Bisexual, Asexual and Ally, and Gay and Genderqueer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apex-magazine.com/reaching-into-the-quiltbag-the-evolving-world-of-queer-speculative-fiction/|title=Reaching into the QUILTBAG: The Evolving World of Queer Speculative Fiction|work=Apex Magazine|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the term==
[[File:Were a gay and happy family wagon.jpg|thumb|LGB families, like these in a 2007 [[pride parade]], are unlikely to label themselves ''[[non-heterosexual]]'' although researchers do so for a variety of reasons.&lt;ref name="The Spectre of Promiscuity"&gt;{{cite book | last = Klesse | first = Christian | title= The Spectre of Promiscuity: Gay Male and Bisexual Non-Monogamies and Polyamories | publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. | isbn = 0-7546-4906-7 | year= 2007 | url =http://books.google.com/books?id=_UR77Hw2WLYC }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The initialisms LGBT or GLBT are not agreeable to everyone that they literally encompass.&lt;ref name="Counseling Lesbian, G"&gt;{{cite book |last=Finnegan |first=Dana G. |first2 = Emily B. |last2=McNally |title=Counseling Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Substance Abusers: Dual Identities |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2002|isbn= 1-56023-925-5 |url =http://books.google.com/books?id=I32nHF_gaTsC }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some argue that transgender and transsexual causes are not the same as that of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people.&lt;ref name="Coming Out in Christi"&gt;{{cite book | last=Wilcox | first=Melissa M. | title= Coming Out in Christianity: Religion, Identity, and Community | publisher=Indiana University Press | year=2003|isbn= 0-253-21619-2|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=yjdhpMnHEIMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument centers on the idea that transgender and transsexuality have to do with gender identity, or a person's understanding of being or not being a man or a woman irrespective of their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/&gt; LGB issues can be seen as a matter of sexual orientation or attraction.&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/&gt; These distinctions have been made in the context of political action in which LGB goals may be perceived to differ from transgender and transsexual goals like [[same-sex marriage]] legislation and [[human rights]] work that is not inclusive of transgender and intersex people.&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/&gt;

Some people advocate the term "minority sexual and gender identities" (MSGI, coined in 2000), or ''gender and sexual minorities'' (GSM) so as to explicitly include all people who are not [[cisgender]] or [[heterosexual]], or ''gender, sexual, and romantic minorities'' (GSRM) which is more explicitly inclusive, but those have not been widely adopted either. &lt;ref name="Bradford Uni"&gt;{{cite web | title=Welcome to the Bradford University Minority Sexual and Gender Identity Site! | publisher=Bradford Uni MSGI Society | year=2008 | url =http://lgbt.wikidot.com/ | accessdate=2008-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acronymfinder.com/Gender,-Sexual,-and-Romantic-Minorities-%28GSRM%29.html|title=GSRM - Gender, Sexual, and Romantic Minorities|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ron-suresha/diversities-may-enrich-lgbtqiap-alphabet-soup_b_3929870.html|title='Diversities' May Enrich 'LGBTQIAP' Alphabet Soup|date=19 September 2013|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theglobalecho.wordpress.com/2014/02/03/the-case-for-gsrm-over-lgbt/|title=The Case for GSRM over LGBT|work=The Global Echo|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other rare umbrella terms are Gender and Sexual Diversities, MOGII (Marginalized Orientations, Gender Identities, and Intersex) and MOGAI (Marginalized Orientations, Gender Alignments and Intersex).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/25/gender-and-sexual-diversities-gsd-lgbt-label-_n_2758908.html?ir=gay-voices&amp;utm_campaign=022513&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Alert-gay-voices&amp;utm_content=Photo|title='Gender And Sexual Diversities,' Or GSD, Should Replace 'LGBT,' Say London Therapists|date=25 February 2013|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dal.ca/news/2014/08/01/pride-on-the-prowl.html|title=Pride on the prowl|work=Dalhousie News|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/reF&gt; 

A reverse to the above situations is evident in the belief of "lesbian &amp;#x26; gay separatism" (not to be confused with the related "[[lesbian separatism]]"), which holds that lesbians and gay men form (or should form) a community distinct and separate from other groups normally included in the LGBTQ sphere.&lt;ref name="Gays/Justice"&gt;{{cite book

Writing in the [[BBC News Magazine]] in 2014, [[Julie Bindel]] questions whether the various gender groupings now, "bracketed together" . . . "share the same issues, values and goals?"  Bindel refers to a number of possible new initialisms for differing combinations and concludes that it may be time for the alliances to be reformed or finally we go, "our separate ways".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28130472|title=Viewpoint: Should gay men and lesbians be bracketed together?|author=[[Julie Bindel]]|date=2 July 2014|work=[[BBC News Magazine]]|accessdate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
