'''LGBT''' is an [[acronym and initialism|initialism]] that stands for '''[[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[transgender]]'''. In use since the 1990s, the term is an adaptation of the initialism '''LGB''', which itself started replacing the term ''gay'' when in reference to [[LGBT community|the community]] beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;Acronyms, initialisms &amp; abbreviations dictionary, Volume 1, Part 1uu

The initialism LGBT is intended to emphasize a diversity of [[sexuality and gender identity-based cultures]] and is sometimes used to refer to anyone who is [[non-heterosexual]] or non-[[cisgender]] instead of exclusively to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.&lt;ref name="Gay Pride Nee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Handbook of Lesb"/&gt;
To recognize this inclusion, a popular variant adds the letter Q for those who identify as [[queer]] and/or are [[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]] their sexual identity as ''LGBTQ'', recorded since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rkUEAQAAIAAJ |title=The Santa Cruz County in-queery, Volume 9, Santa Cruz Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgendered Community Center, 1996 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2008-11-01 |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the one hand, some [[intersex]] people who want to be included in LGBT groups suggest an extended initialism ''LGBTI'' (recorded since 1999&lt;ref&gt;William L. Maurice, Marjorie A.

{{further|Terminology of homosexuality}}
Before the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s, there was no common non-derogatory vocabulary for [[Non-heterosexuals|non-heterosexuality]]; the closest such term, "[[third gender]]", traces back to the 1860s but never gained wide acceptance in the United States.&lt;ref name="The Social Studies C"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Hubert C. (1980) ''The "third sex" theory of Karl Heinrich Ulrichs'', Journal of Homosexuality. 1980–1981 Fall–Winter; 6(1–2): pp. 103–1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Magnus Hirschfeld|Hirschfeld, Magnus]], 1904. ''Berlins Drittes Geschlecht'' ("Berlin's Third Sex")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Havelock Ellis|Ellis, Havelock]] and [[John Addington Symonds|Symonds, J. A.]], 1897. ''Sexual Inversion''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Carpenter|Carpenter, Edward]], 1908. ''[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/carpenter-is.html The Intermediate Sex: A Study of Some Transitional Types of Men and Women]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duc, Aimée, 1901. ''Sind es Frauen? Roman über das dritte Geschlecht'' ("Are These Women? Novel about the Third Sex")&lt;/ref&gt;

The first widely used term, ''[[homosexual]]'', was thought to carry negative connotations and tended to be replaced by ''[[homophile]]'' in the 1950s and 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Minton |first=Henry |title=Departing from Deviance |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-226-53043-4 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=cCoADHpbzHsC&amp;pg=PA238 |accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently ''[[gay]]'' in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="The Social Studies C"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=E.

"From Accommodation to Liberation: A Social Movement Analysis of Lesbians in the Homophile Movement." ''Gender and Society'', '''8''', (3) p. 424–443.&lt;/ref&gt; As equality was a priority for [[lesbian feminism|lesbian feminists]], disparity of roles between men and women or [[butch and femme]] were viewed as patriarchal. Lesbian feminists eschewed [[gender role]] play that had been pervasive in bars, as well as the perceived chauvinism of gay men; many lesbian feminists refused to work with gay men, or take up their causes.&lt;ref&gt;Faderman, Lillian (1991). ''Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life in Twentieth Century America'', Penguin Books. ISBN 0-14-017122-3, p. 210–211.&lt;/ref&gt; Lesbians who held a more [[essentialist]] view that they had been born homosexual and used the descriptor "lesbian" to define sexual attraction, often considered the separatist, angry opinions of lesbian-feminists to be detrimental to the cause of gay rights.&lt;ref&gt;Faderman (1991), p. 217–218.&lt;/ref&gt; This was soon followed by bisexual and transgender people also seeking recognition as legitimate categories within the larger community.&lt;ref name="Gay Pride Nee"/&gt; After the initial euphoria of the [[Stonewall riots]] wore off, starting in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, there was a change in perception; some gays and lesbians became less accepting of [[bisexual]] or [[transgender]] people.&lt;ref name="Transgender Subjectivities"&gt;{{cite book |last=Leli |first=Ubaldo |coauthors=Jack Drescher |title=Transgender Subjectivities: A Clinician's Guide |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2005|isbn= 0-7890-2576-0

The initialism LGBT saw occasional use in the United States from about 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?ei=PW9JTfOeOtPd4AbR54SjDA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=PiglAQAAIAAJ Research, policy and practice: Annual meeting], American Educational Research Association Verlag AERA, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
Not until the 1990s did it become common to speak of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people with equal respect within the movement.&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/&gt;
Although the LGBT community has seen much controversy regarding universal acceptance of different member groups (bisexual and transgender individuals, in particular, have sometimes been marginalized by the larger LGBT community), the term LGBT has been a positive symbol of inclusion.&lt;ref name="The Handbook of Lesb"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shankle |first=Michael D.

A reverse to the above situations is evident in the belief of "lesbian &amp;#x26; gay separatism" (not to be confused with the related "[[lesbian separatism]]"), which holds that lesbians and gay men form (or should form) a community distinct and separate from other groups normally included in the LGBTQ sphere.&lt;ref name="In-Between Bodies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gays/Justice"&gt;{{cite book
