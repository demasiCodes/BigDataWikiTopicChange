'''''{{dfn|LGBT}}''''' is an [[Acronym|initialism]] that stands for "[[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]]". In use since the late 1980s, the initialism, as well as some of its common variants, functions as an [[Hyponymy and hypernymy|umbrella term]] for marginalized [[Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures|sexualities and gender identities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Parent|first1=Mike C.|last2=DeBlaere|first2=Cirleen|last3=Moradi|first3=Bonnie|date=June 2013|title=Approaches to Research on Intersectionality: Perspectives on Gender, LGBT, and Racial/Ethnic Identities|journal=Sex Roles|volume=68|issue=11–12|pages=639–645|doi=10.1007/s11199-013-0283-2|s2cid=144285021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''LGBT'' is an adaptation of '''''{{dfn|LGB}}''''', which began to replace the term ''gay'' (or ''gay and lesbian''), in reference to the broader [[LGBT community]] beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;''Acronyms, Initialisms &amp; Abbreviations Dictionary'', Volume 1, Part 1.

It may refer to anyone who is [[non-heterosexual]] or non-[[cisgender]], instead of exclusively to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.&lt;ref name="The Handbook of Lesb" /&gt; A popular variant, '''''{{dfn|LGBTQ}}''''', adds the letter ''Q'' for those who identify as [[queer]] or are [[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]] their sexual or [[gender identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2014/05/23/civilities-what-does-the-acronym-lgbtq-stand-for/|access-date=19 February 2018|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|title=Civilities, What does the acronym LGBTQ stand for?|archive-date=3 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200103082543/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2014/05/23/civilities-what-does-the-acronym-lgbtq-stand-for/|url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular variation, '''''LGBTQ+''''', adds a [[plus sign]] in order to represent other identities not perceived to be included in ''LGBTQ''. Many further variations of the acronym exist, such as '''''LGBT+''''' (simplified to encompass the ''Q'' concept within the plus sign), '''''LGBTQIA+''''' (adding [[intersex]], and [[asexuality|asexual]]/[[aromantic]]), and '''''2SLGBTQ+''''' (adding [[two-spirit]] for a term specific to [[Indigenous North Americans]]). The ''LGBT'' label is not universally agreed to by everyone that it is generally intended to include.&lt;ref name="Counseling Lesbian, G" /&gt;

As lesbians forged more public identities, the phrase ''gay and lesbian'' became more common.&lt;ref name="Gay Pride Nee"/&gt; A dispute as to whether the primary focus of their political aims should be [[feminism]] or [[gay rights]] led to the dissolution of some lesbian organizations, including [[Daughters of Bilitis]], which was founded by [[Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqt4krhmQrwC&amp;dq=daughters+of+bilitis+founder&amp;pg=PA394 |title=Rebels, Rubyfruit, and Rhinestones: Queering Space in the Stonewall South - James Thomas Sears - Google Books |isbn=9780813529646 |access-date=2 May 2022 |last1=Sears |first1=James Thomas |year=2001 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |archive-date=14 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220514161912/https://books.google.com/books?id=wqt4krhmQrwC&amp;dq=daughters+of+bilitis+founder&amp;pg=PA394 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; but disbanded in 1970 following disputes over which goal should take precedence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Esterberg | first1 = Kristen | year = 1994 | title = From Accommodation to Liberation: A Social Movement Analysis of Lesbians in the Homophile Movement | journal = Gender and Society | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 424–443 |doi=10.1177/089124394008003008 | s2cid = 144795512 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As equality was a priority for [[lesbian feminism|lesbian feminists]], disparity of roles between men and women or [[butch and femme]] were viewed as [[patriarchy|patriarchal]].

Lesbians who held the [[essentialism|essentialist]] view that they had been born homosexual and used the descriptor ''lesbian'' to define sexual attraction often considered the [[Feminist separatism|separatist]] opinions of lesbian-feminists to be detrimental to the cause of gay rights.&lt;ref&gt;Faderman (1991), p. 217–218.&lt;/ref&gt; Bisexual and transgender people also sought recognition as legitimate categories within the larger minority community.&lt;ref name="Gay Pride Nee"&gt;{{cite news | last=Swain | first=Keith W. | title=Gay Pride Needs New Direction | newspaper=[[Denver Post]] | date=21 June 2007 | url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_6198394?source=rss | access-date=5 July 2008 | archive-date=21 April 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421235751/http://www.denverpost.com/ci_6198394?source=rss | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s and the early 1980s, after the elation of change following group action in the 1969 [[Stonewall riots]] in [[New York City]], some gays and lesbians became less accepting of [[bisexual]] or [[transgender]] people.&lt;ref name="Transgender Subjectivities"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leli |first1=Ubaldo |first2=Jack |last2=Drescher |title=Transgender Subjectivities: A Clinician's Guide |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7890-2576-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QiJryCzrZmYC |access-date=2 July 2015 |archive-date=6 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906145439/https://books.google.com/books?id=QiJryCzrZmYC |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alexander |first1=Jonathan |first2=Karen |last2=Yescavage |title=Bisexuality and Transgenderism: InterSEXions of The Others |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-56023-287-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2SOe4igsrbgC |access-date=2 July 2015 |archive-date=6 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906150516/https://books.google.com/books?id=2SOe4igsrbgC |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics{{like whom?|date=September 2018}} said that transgender people were acting out [[stereotypes]], and bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were afraid to [[coming out|come out]] and be honest about their identity.&lt;ref name="Transgender Subjectivities"/&gt; Each community has struggled to develop its own identity including whether, and how, to align with other [[gender]] and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day.&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/&gt; LGBTQ activists and artists have created posters to raise consciousness about the issue since the movement began.&lt;ref name="Exhibition Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicalgraphics.org/out-of-the-closet|website=[[Center for the Study of Political Graphics]]|access-date=1 October 2016|title=Out of the Closet and Into the Streets|archive-date=2 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002103737/http://www.politicalgraphics.org/out-of-the-closet|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 1988, activists began to use the initialism ''LGBT'' in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PiglAQAAIAAJ Research, policy and practice: Annual meeting] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190619085339/https://books.google.com/books?id=PiglAQAAIAAJ |date=19 June 2019 }}, American Educational Research Association Verlag AERA, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Not until the 1990s within the movement did gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people gain equal respect.&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/&gt; This spurred some organizations to adopt new names, as the [[GLBT Historical Society]] did in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.glbthistory.org/timeline |title=Our History |last=Koskovich |first=Gerard |website=The GLBT Historical Society |access-date=7 January 2022 |archive-date=7 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220107212644/https://www.glbthistory.org/timeline |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the LGBT community has seen much controversy regarding universal acceptance of different member groups (bisexual and transgender individuals, in particular, have sometimes been [[Social exclusion|marginalized]] by the larger LGBT community), the term ''LGBT'' has been a positive symbol of [[Social inclusion|inclusion]].&lt;ref name="The Handbook of Lesb"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shankle |first=Michael D. |title=The Handbook of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Public Health: A Practitioner's Guide To Service |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-56023-496-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pUUyLSKD5voC |access-date=2 July 2015 |archive-date=6 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906170653/https://books.google.com/books?id=pUUyLSKD5voC |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/&gt;

Despite the fact that ''LGBT'' does not nominally encompass all individuals in smaller communities (see Variants below), the term is generally accepted to include those not specifically identified in the four-letter initialism.&lt;ref name="The Handbook of Lesb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend" /&gt; Overall, the use of the term ''LGBT'' has, over time, largely aided in bringing otherwise marginalized individuals into the general community.&lt;ref name="The Handbook of Lesb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend" /&gt; Transgender actress [[Candis Cayne]], in 2009, described the LGBT community as "the last great minority", noting that "we can still be harassed openly" and be "called out on television".&lt;ref name="Advocate 2009-03"&gt;{{cite news|title=I Advocate...|date=March 2009|work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|publisher=Issue #1024|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asexual, aromantic and agender inclusion ===
{{main|Asexuality|Aromanticism|Agender}}
In the early 2010s, [[asexuality]] and [[aromanticism]] started gaining wider recognition. Around 2015, they were included in the expanded initialism '''''LGBTQIA''''', with the A standing for ''asexual'', ''aromantic'', commonly grouped together as ''[[wikt:a-spec|a-spec]]'' along with ''[[agender]]''.&lt;ref name="glaadA" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Asexual individuals experience minimal to no sexual attraction to others, and it is crucial to acknowledge that asexuality is a legitimate sexual orientation, not a deficiency or a temporary state. Similarly, aromantic individuals lack romantic attraction to others, yet they can still forge profound emotional connections and strong bonds with people without the romantic component. Furthermore, agender individuals either have no gender identity or possess a neutral or genderless gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=19 September 2019 |title=In this issue |journal=Lab Animal |volume=48 |issue=10 |pages=269 |doi=10.1038/s41684-019-0416-5 |issn=0093-7355|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people have mistakenly claimed the A stands for ally, but allies are not a marginalized group and mentions of A for ally have regularly sparked controversy as a form of [[LGBT erasure]].&lt;ref name="ISD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="equinox" /&gt;
