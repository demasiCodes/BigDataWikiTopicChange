{{Discrimination sidebar}}

'''Lookism''' is discrimination against or prejudice towards others based on their appearance. The term is not in widespread use{{Fact|date=March 2009}}, though it appears in major English language dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com Bartleby.com] — "[http://www.bartleby.com/61/64/L0246450.html Lookism]". ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition.'' 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lookism has received scholarly attention both from a [[cultural studies]] and an [[economics]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Tietje and Steven Cresap. (2005). "[http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/19_2/19_2_2.pdf Is Lookism Unjust?: The Ethics of Aesthetics and Public Policy Implications]". Journal of Libertarian Studies 19 (2): 31-50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://angelastalcup.com/sample_article.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the former context, lookism relates to preconceived notions of [[beauty]] and cultural [[stereotyping]] based on appearance as well as [[gender role]]s and expectations. Important economic considerations include the question of income gaps based on looks, as well increased or decreased productivity from workers considered beautiful or ugly by their co-workers.

It is believed that those who are good looking get better jobs, are trusted more, treated well, and get more lenient treatment in court{{Fact|date=April 2009}}.
