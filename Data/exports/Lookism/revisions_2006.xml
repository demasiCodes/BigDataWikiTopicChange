The term is not yet in widespread usage, though it appears in major English language dictionaries &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com Bartleby.com] — "[http://www.bartleby.com/61/64/L0246450.html Lookism]". ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition.'' 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Lookism has received scholarly attention both from a [[cultural studies]] and an [[economics]] perspective &lt;ref&gt;Louis Tietje and Steven Cresap. (2005). "[http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/19_2/19_2_2.pdf Is Lookism Unjust?: The Ethics of Aesthetics and Public Policy Implications]". Journal of Libertarian Studies 19 (2): 31-50.&lt;/ref&gt;. In the former context, lookism relates to preconceived notions of [[beauty]] and cultural stereotyping based on appearance as well as [[gender]] roles and expectations. Important economic considerations include the question of income gaps based on looks, as well increased or decreased productivity from workers considered beautiful or ugly by their co-workers.
