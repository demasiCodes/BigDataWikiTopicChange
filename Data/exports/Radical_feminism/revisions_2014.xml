{{Feminism sidebar |expanded=Variants}} 
'''Radical feminism''' is a perspective within [[feminism]] that focuses on the hypothesis of [[patriarchy]] as a [[Systems theory|system of power]] that organizes society into a complex of [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] based on the assertion that [[Androcentrism|male supremacy]]&lt;ref name=Willis-117&gt;Willis, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; oppresses women. Radical feminism aims to challenge and overthrow patriarchy by opposing standard [[gender role]]s and oppression of women and calls for a radical reordering of society.&lt;ref name=Willis-117 /&gt; Early radical feminism, arising within [[second-wave feminism]] in the 1960s,&lt;ref name=Willis-118&gt;Willis, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; typically viewed patriarchy as a "transhistorical phenomenon"&lt;ref name=Willis-122&gt;Willis, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; prior to or deeper than other sources of [[oppression]], "not only the oldest and most universal form of domination but the primary form"&lt;ref name=Willis-123&gt;Willis, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; and the model for all others.&lt;ref name=Willis-123 /&gt; Later politics derived from radical feminism ranged from [[cultural feminism]]&lt;ref name=Willis-117 /&gt; to more [[syncretism|syncretic]] politics that placed issues of [[social class|class]], [[economics]], etc. on a par with patriarchy as sources of oppression.&lt;ref name=Willis-141&gt;Willis, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Radical feminists locate the root cause of women's oppression in patriarchal gender relations, as opposed to [[legal system]]s (as in [[liberal feminism]]) or [[class conflict]] (as in [[socialist feminism]] and [[Marxist feminism]]).

Over the years radical feminists have been criticized for arguing that male domination of women is the ultimate source of all forms of oppression, for emphasizing sex-based [[discrimination]] at the expense of [[Race (human classification)|race]]- and [[Social class|class]]-based discrimination, for being unwilling to work with men to effect change through political channels and for marginalizing lesbian sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yorku.ca/problema/Issues/Problematique0105.pdf | title=Women’s Sexuality: On the Socialist Feminist Road to Discovery | first=Margaret | last=Hillyard Little | quote=Rich’s definition of lesbianism is extremely problematic for several reasons. First, this asexual reductionist definition does not allow women to speak about what is unique in a lesbian experience and thus limits the erotic. Second, in romanticizing the notion of resistance to heterosexual violence Rich makes it impossible to deﬁne what are the conditions that allow for successful resistance. Third, Rich’s concept of lesbian continuum is essentialist; she reinforces the belief that men and women have fundamentally opposing sexual natures and that the latter tends to be passive or asexual. Fourth, this transhistorical and transcultural version of lesbianism undervalues the important historical developments and changes in material conditions which allow some women to establish a distinct lesbian identity while others do not have such a privilege. Finally, Rich believes that compulsory heterosexuality is the key to women’s subordination and assumes that all heterosexual relations are coercive or compulsory relations. Targeting heterosexuality as the key mechanism of male dominance romanticizes lesbianism and ignores the actual quality of individual lesbian or heterosexual women’s lives. In short, Rich’s work has a disturbing lesbian separatist tone, implying that as soon as women stop sleeping with men they will destroy the institution of compulsory heterosexuality and hence gain their liberation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory and ideology ==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2007}}
Radical feminists assert that their society is a patriarchy in which the class of men are the oppressors of the class of women.&lt;ref&gt;Echols, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Radical feminists seek to abolish patriarchy. Radical feminism posits the theory that, due to patriarchy, women have come to be viewed as the "other" to the male norm and as such have been systematically oppressed and marginalized. They also believe that the way to deal with patriarchy and oppression of all kinds is to address the underlying causes of these problems through revolution. They assert that men as a class benefit from the oppression of women.

While some radical feminists propose that the oppression of women is the most fundamental form of oppression, one that cuts across boundaries of all other forms of oppression, others acknowledge the simultaneous and [[Intersectionality|intersecting]] effect of other independent categories of oppression as well. These other categories of oppression may include, but are not limited to, oppression based on [[racism|race]], [[classism|social class]], [[lookism|perceived attractiveness]], [[heterosexism|sexual orientation]], and [[ableism|ability]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Patriarchal theory is not always defined as a belief that all men always benefit from the oppression of all women. Patriarchal theory maintains that the primary element of patriarchy is a relationship of dominance, where one party is dominant and exploits the other party for the benefit of the former. Radical feminists believe that men use social systems and other methods of control to keep non-dominant men and all women suppressed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Radical feminists also believe that eliminating patriarchy, and other systems which perpetuate the domination of one group over another, will liberate everyone from an unjust society.

== Movement ==

=== Roots ===
The ideology of radical feminism in the United States developed as a component of the [[women's liberation]] movement. It grew largely due to the influence of the civil rights movement that had gained momentum in the 1960s and many of the women who took up the cause of radical feminism had previous experience with radical protest in the struggle against racism. Chronologically, it can be seen within the context of [[second wave feminism]] that started in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Gamble, ed. The Routledge companion to feminism and postfeminism (2001) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The primary players and the pioneers of this second wave of feminism included the likes of [[Shulamith Firestone]], [[Kathie Sarachild]], [[Ti-Grace Atkinson]], [[Carol Hanisch]], and [[Judith C. Brown|Judith Brown]]. Many local women's groups in the late sixties, such as the UCLA Women's Liberation Front (WLF), offered diplomatic statements of radical feminism's ideologies. UCLA's WLF co-founder Devra Weber recalls, "'... the radical feminists were opposed to patriarchy, but not necessarily capitalism. In our group at least, they opposed so-called male dominated national liberation struggles'".&lt;ref&gt;Linden-Ward &amp; Green, p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt;

These women helped secure the bridge that translated radical protest for racial equality over to the struggle for women's rights; by witnessing the discrimination and oppression to which the black population was subjected, they were able to gain strength and motivation to do the same for their fellow women. They took up the cause and advocated for a variety of women's issues, including abortion, the Equal Rights Amendment, access to credit, and equal pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Sara M.|title=Re-Viewing the Second Wave|journal=Feminist Studies|date=Summer 2002|volume=28|issue=2|pages=258–267|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3178740|doi=10.2307/3178740}}&lt;/ref&gt; They failed to stir up enough interest among most of the women's fringe groups of society. A majority of women of color did not participate a great deal in the formation of radical feminist movement because it did not address many issues that were relevant to those from a working-class background, of which they were a sizeable part.&lt;ref&gt;Linden-Ward &amp; Green, p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt; But for those who felt compelled enough to stand up for the cause, radical action was needed, and so they took to the streets and formed [[consciousness raising]] groups to rally support for the cause and recruit people who would be willing to fight for it. Later on however, Second Wave radical feminism  saw greater numbers of black feminists and other women of color participating.

In the 1960s, radical feminism emerged simultaneously within liberal feminist and working class feminist discussions, first in the [[United States]], then in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]]. Those involved had gradually come to believe that it was not only the [[middle-class]] [[nuclear family]] oppressed women, but that it was also social movements and organizations that claimed to stand for human liberation, notably the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], the [[New Left]], and [[Marxism|Marxist]] political parties, all of which they considered to be male-dominated and male-oriented. Women in countercultural groups related that the gender relations present in such groups were very much those of mainstream culture.

In the United States, radical feminism developed as a response to some of the perceived failings of both New Left organizations such as the [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) and feminist organizations such as NOW.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Initially concentrated mainly in big cities like [[New York City|New York]], [[Chicago]], [[Boston]], [[Washington, DC]], and on the West Coast,&lt;ref&gt;Willis, p. 118. Willis doesn't mention Chicago, but as early as 1967 Chicago was a major site for consciousness-raising and home of the ''Voice of Women's Liberation Movement''; see Kate Bedford and Ara Wilson [http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/wilson935/chrono1.htm Lesbian Feminist Chronology: 1963-1970], accessed online 8 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; radical feminist groups spread across the country rapidly from 1968 to 1972.

In the [[United Kingdom]], feminism developed out of discussions within community based radical women's organizations and discussions by women within the [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] left.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Radical feminism was imported into the UK by American radical feminists and seized on by British radical women as offering an exciting new theory to replace [[Trotskyism]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} As the 1970s progressed, British feminists split into two major schools of thought: [[socialist feminism|socialist]] and radical.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} In 1977, another split occurred, with a third grouping calling itself "revolutionary feminism" breaking away from the other two.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

[[Australia]]n radical feminism developed slightly later, during an extended period of social radicalization, largely as an expression of that radicalization.

As a form of practice, radical feminists introduced the use of [[consciousness raising]] (CR) groups. These groups brought together intellectuals, workers, and middle class women in developed Western countries to discuss their experiences. During these discussions, women noted a shared and repressive system regardless of their political affiliation or social class. Based on these discussions, the women drew the conclusion that ending patriarchy was the most necessary step towards a truly free society. These consciousness-raising sessions allowed early radical feminists to develop a political [[ideology]] based on common experiences women faced with male supremacy. Consciousness raising was extensively used in chapter sub-units of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) during the 1970s. The feminism that emerged from these discussions stood first and foremost for the liberation of women, as women, from the oppression of men in their own lives, as well as men in power. Radical feminism claimed that a totalizing ideology and social formation—''patriarchy'' (government or rule by fathers)—dominated women in the interests of men.

Within groups such as [[New York Radical Women]] (1967–1969), (no relation to [[Radical Women]], a present-day socialist feminist organization), which Ellen Willis characterized as "the first women's liberation group in New York City",&lt;ref name=Willis-119&gt;Willis, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; a radical feminist ideology began to emerge that declared that "the personal is political"&lt;ref name=Willis-118 /&gt; and "sisterhood is powerful",&lt;ref name=Willis-118 /&gt; formulations that arose from these consciousness-raising sessions. New York Radical Women fell apart in early 1969 in what came to be known as the "politico-feminist split"&lt;ref name=Willis-119 /&gt; with the "politicos"&lt;ref name=Willis-119 /&gt; seeing capitalism as the source of women's oppression, while the "feminists"&lt;ref name=Willis-119 /&gt; saw male supremacy as "a set of material, institutionalized relations, not just bad attitudes."&lt;ref name=Willis-119 /&gt; The feminist side of the split, which soon began referring to itself as "radical feminists",&lt;ref name=Willis-119 /&gt; soon constituted the basis of a new organization, [[Redstockings]]. At the same time, Ti-Grace Atkinson led "a radical split-off from NOW",&lt;ref name=Willis-124&gt;Willis, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; which became known as [[The Feminists]].&lt;ref name=Willis-124 /&gt; A third major stance would be articulated by the [[New York Radical Feminists]], founded later in 1969 by [[Shulamith Firestone]] (who broke from the Redstockings) and [[Anne Koedt]].&lt;ref name=Willis-133&gt;Willis, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, the movement produced "a prodigious output of leaflets, pamphlets, journals, magazine articles, newspaper and radio and TV interviews."&lt;ref name=Willis-118 /&gt; Many important{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} feminist works, such as Koedt's essay ''[[The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm]]'' (1970) and [[Kate Millet]]'s book ''[[Sexual Politics]]'' (1970), emerged during this time and in this milieu.

=== Ideology emerges and diverges ===
At the beginning of this period, "[[heterosexuality]] was more or less an unchallenged assumption."&lt;ref name=Willis-121 /&gt; Among radical feminists, the view became widely held that, thus far, the sexual freedoms gained in the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s—in particular, the decreasing emphasis on [[monogamy]]—had been largely gained by men at women's expense.&lt;ref name=Willis-121 /&gt; This assumption of heterosexuality would soon be challenged by the rise of [[political lesbianism]], closely associated with Atkinson and The Feminists.&lt;ref name=Willis-131&gt;Willis, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; The belief that the sexual revolution was a victory of men over women would eventually lead to the women's anti-pornography movement of the late 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Redstockings and The Feminists were both radical feminist organizations, but held rather distinct views. Most members of Redstockings held to a [[materialism|materialist]] and anti-[[psychologism|psychologistic]] view. They viewed men's oppression of women as ongoing and deliberate, holding individual men responsible for this oppression, viewing institutions and systems (including the [[family]]) as mere vehicles of conscious male intent, and rejecting psychologistic explanations of female submissiveness as blaming women for collaboration in their own oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Willis, pp. 124–126.&lt;/ref&gt; They held to a view—which Willis would later describe as "neo-[[Maoism|Maoist]]"&lt;ref name=Willis-124 /&gt;—that it would be possible to unite all or virtually all women, as a class, to confront this oppression by personally confronting men.&lt;ref name=Willis-128&gt;Willis, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Feminists held a more [[idealism|idealistic]], psychologistic, and [[utopianism|utopian]] philosophy, with a greater emphasis on "[[sex role]]s",&lt;ref name=Willis-130-132&gt;Willis, pp. 130–132.&lt;/ref&gt; seeing [[sexism]] as rooted in "complementary patterns of male and female behavior".&lt;ref name=Willis-130-132 /&gt; They placed more emphasis on institutions, seeing marriage, family, prostitution, and heterosexuality as all existing to perpetuate the "sex-role system".&lt;ref name=Willis-130-132 /&gt; They saw all of these as institutions to be destroyed. Within the group, there were further disagreements, such as Koedt's viewing the institution of "normal"&lt;ref name=Willis-130-132 /&gt; sexual intercourse as being focused mainly on male sexual or erotic pleasure, while Atkinson viewed it mainly in terms of reproduction.&lt;ref name=Willis-130-132 /&gt; In contrast to the Redstockings, The Feminists generally considered genitally focused sexuality to be inherently male.&lt;ref name=Willis-132&gt;Willis, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellen Willis would later write that insofar as the Redstockings considered abandoning heterosexual activity, they saw it as a "bitter price"&lt;ref name=Willis-132 /&gt; they "might have to pay for [their] militance",&lt;ref name=Willis-132 /&gt; whereas The Feminists embraced [[separatist feminism]] as a strategy.&lt;ref name=Willis-132 /&gt;

The New York Radical Feminists (NYRF) took a more psychologistic (and even [[biological determinism|biologically determinist]]) line. They argued that men dominated women not so much for material benefits as for the ego satisfaction intrinsic in domination. Similarly, they rejected the Redstockings view that women submitted only out of necessity or The Feminists' implicit view that they submitted out of cowardice, but instead argued that social conditioning simply led most women to accept a submissive role as "right and natural".&lt;ref&gt;Willis, pp. 133–134.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Action ===
Radical feminism was not and is not only a movement of ideology and theory. Radical feminists also take [[direct action]]. In 1968, they protested against the [[Miss America]] pageant by throwing high heels and other feminine accoutrements into a garbage bin, to represent freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Echols, [http://books.google.com/books?id=6zaVkAjBuPEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA92#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 92–101.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, they also staged a sit-in at the ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Echols, pp. 195–197.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they held speakouts&lt;ref name=Willis-117 /&gt; about topics such as rape.

=== Radical egalitarianism ===
Because of their commitment to [[radical egalitarianism]], most early radical feminist groups operated initially without any formal internal structure. When informal leadership developed, it was often resented. Many groups ended up expending more effort debating their own internal operations than dealing with external matters, seeking to "perfect a perfect society in microcosm"&lt;ref name=Willis-138-140&gt;Willis, pp. 138–140.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than focus on the larger world. Resentment of leadership was compounded by the view that all "class striving"&lt;ref name=Willis-138-140 /&gt; was "male-identified".&lt;ref name=Willis-138-140 /&gt; In the extreme, exemplified by The Feminists, the upshot, according to Ellen Willis, was "unworkable, mechanistic demands for an absolutely random division of labor, taking no account of differences in skill, experience, or even inclination".&lt;ref name=Willis-138-140 /&gt; "The result," writes Willis, "was not democracy but paralysis."&lt;ref name=Willis-138-140 /&gt; When The Feminists began to select randomly who could talk to the press, Ti-Grace Atkinson quit the organization she had founded.&lt;ref name=Willis-138-140 /&gt;

=== Social organization and aims in the U.S. and Australia ===
Radical feminists have generally formed small activist or community associations around either consciousness raising or concrete aims. Many radical feminists in Australia participated in a series of [[squatting|squats]] to establish various women's centres, and this form of action was common in the late 1970s and early 1980s. By the mid-1980s many of the original consciousness raising groups had dissolved, and radical feminism was more and more associated with loosely organized university collectives. Radical feminism can still be seen, particularly within student activism and among working class women.

In Australia, many feminist social organizations accepted government funding during the 1980s, and the election of a conservative government in 1996 crippled these organizations.

While radical feminists aim to dismantle patriarchal society in a historical sense, their immediate aims are generally concrete. Some common demands include:

* Expanding [[reproductive rights]].
*:{{quote|Defined by feminists in the 1970s as a basic human right, it includes the right to abortion and birth control, but implies much more. To be realised, reproductive freedom must include not only woman's right to choose childbirth, abortion, sterilisation or birth control, but also her right to make those choices freely, without pressure from individual men, doctors, governmental or religious authorities. It is a key issue for women, since without it the other freedoms we appear to have, such as the right to education, jobs and equal pay, may prove illusory. Provisions of childcare, medical treatment, and society's attitude towards children are also involved.&lt;ref&gt;From ''The Encyclopedia of Feminism'' (1986) Lisa Tuttle&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* Changing the organizational sexual culture, ''e.g.'', breaking down traditional gender roles and reevaluating societal concepts of femininity and masculinity (a common demand in U.S. universities during the 1980s). In this, they often form tactical alliances with other currents of feminism.

==Views on the sex industry==
Radical feminists have written about a wide range of issues regarding the sex industry - which they tend to oppose - including but not limited to: [[Feminist views of pornography#Harm to women during production|harm to women during the production of pornography]], [[Feminist views of pornography#Social harm from consumption|the social harm from consumption of pornography]], [[Feminist views on prostitution#Coercion and poverty|the coercion and poverty that leads women to become prostitutes]], [[Feminist views on prostitution#Long term effects on the prostitutes|the long term effects of prostitution]], [[Feminist views on prostitution#The raced and classed nature of prostitution|the raced and classed nature of prostitution]], and the often [[Feminist views on prostitution#Male dominance over women|inherent male dominance over women in prostitution]] as well as pornography.

===Views on prostitution===
{{main|Feminist views on prostitution}} 
Radical feminists argue that, in most cases, prostitution is not a conscious and calculated choice. They say that most women who become prostitutes do so because they were forced or coerced by a pimp or by human trafficking, or, when it is an independent decision, it is generally the result of extreme poverty and lack of opportunity, or of serious underlying problems, such as drug addiction, past trauma (such as child sexual abuse) and other unfortunate circumstances.

Radical feminists point out that women from the lowest socioeconomic classes—impoverished women, women with a low level of education, women from the most disadvantaged racial and ethnic minorities—are overrepresented in prostitution all over the world. "If prostitution is a free choice, why are the women with the fewest choices the ones most often found doing it?" (MacKinnon, 1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/fempsy3.html |title=Prostitution in Five Countries |publisher=Feminism &amp; Psychology |year=1998 |authors=Melissa Farley, Isin Baral, Merab Kiremire and Ufuk Sezgin
|pages=405–426 |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large percentage of prostitutes polled in one study of 475 people involved in prostitution reported that they were in a difficult period of their lives and most wanted to leave the occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Farley, Melissa. (April/2/2000) [http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/faq/000008.html Prostitution: Factsheet on Human Rights Violations]. Prostitution Research &amp; Education. Retrieved on 2009-09-03.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Catharine MacKinnon]] argues that "In prostitution, women have sex with men they would never otherwise have sex with. The money thus acts as a form of force, not as a measure of consent. It acts like physical force does in rape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpbn.org/program/intelligence-squared/episode/its-wrong-pay-sex |title=It's Wrong to Pay for Sex |author= |date=05/08/2009 |work= |publisher=Connecticut Public Radio |accessdate=8 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They believe no person can be said to truly consent to their own oppression and no people should have the right to consent to the oppression of others.  In the words of [[Kathleen Barry]], consent is not a “good divining rod as to the existence of oppression, and consent to violation is a fact of oppression.  Oppression cannot effectively be gauged according to the degree of “consent,” since even in slavery there was some consent, if consent is defined as inability to see, or feel any alternative.”&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;Barry, K "The Prostitution of Sexuality: The Global Exploitation of Women" New York: NYU Press 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrea Dworkin]] stated her opinions as: "Prostitution in and of itself is an abuse of a woman's body. Those of us who say this are accused of being simple-minded. But prostitution is very simple. (…) In prostitution, no woman stays whole. It is impossible to use a human body in the way women's bodies are used in prostitution and to have a whole human being at the end of it, or in the middle of it, or close to the beginning of it. It's impossible. And no woman gets whole again later, after.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/MichLawJourI.html |title=Prostitution and Male Supremacy (1 of 2) |publisher=Nostatusquo.com |date=1992-10-31 |author=Andrea Dworkin |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical feminist thinking has analyzed prostitution as a cornerstone of patriarchal domination and sexual subjugation of women that impacts negatively not only on the women and girls in prostitution but on all women as a group because prostitution continually affirms and reinforces patriarchal definitions of women as having a primary function to serve men sexually. They claim it is crucial that society does not replace one patriarchal view on female sexuality - e.g., that women should not have sex outside marriage/a relationship and that casual sex is shameful for a woman, etc. - with another similarly oppressive and patriarchal view - acceptance of prostitution, a sexual practice which is based on a highly patriarchal construct of sexuality: that the sexual pleasure of a woman is irrelevant, that her only role during sex is to submit to the man’s sexual demands and to do what he tells her, that sex should be controlled by the man and that the woman’s response and satisfaction are irrelevant. These feminists argue that sexual liberation for women cannot be achieved as long as we normalize unequal sexual practices where a man dominates a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catw-ap.org/resources/speeches-papers/sex-from-human-intimacy-to-sexual-labor-or-is-prostitution-a-human-right/ |title=SEX: From human intimacy to "sexual labor" or Is prostitution a human right? |author=Cecilia Hofmann |publisher=CATW-Asia Pacific |date = August 1997|accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it and who may be making a tremendous psychological effort to mentally dissociate herself from the client. They say that the act of prostitution is not a mutual and equal sex act as it puts the woman in a subordinate position, reducing her to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client. These feminists believe that many clients use the services of prostitutes because they enjoy the "power trip" they derive from the act and the control they have over the woman during the sexual activity. [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argues that prostitution "isn't sex only, it’s you do what I say, sex."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://intelligencesquaredus.org/wp-content/uploads/ItsWrongToPayForSex-042109.pdf |title=It's wrong to pay for sex |author= |date=4/22/09 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical feminists strongly object to the [[patriarchal]] ideology which has been one of the justifications for the existence of prostitution throughout history (and which they say continues to justify it in many cultures), that is, that prostitution is a "necessary evil", as men cannot control themselves, and thus it is "necessary" that a small number of women be "sacrificed" to be used and abused by men, in order to protect "chaste" women from rape and harassment. These feminists see prostitution as a form of slavery, and say that, far from decreasing rape rates, prostitution leads to a sharp ''increase'' in sexual violence against women, by sending the message that it is acceptable for a man to treat a woman as a sexual instrument over which he has total control. [[Melissa Farley]] argues that Nevada's high rape rate is connected to legal prostitution because Nevada is the only US state which allows legal brothels and is ranked 4th out of the 50 U.S. states for sexual assault crimes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inner-star.org/sexualassaultprevention.html |title=Sexual Assault Prevention Program at ISPAN |publisher=Inner-star.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying, "Nevada's rape rate is higher than the U.S. average and way higher than the rape rate in California, New York and New Jersey. Why is this? Legal prostitution creates an atmosphere in this state in which women are not humans equal to them, are disrespected by men, and which then sets the stage of increased violence against women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pahrumpvalleytimes.com/2007/Sep-07-Fri-2007/news/16519321.html |title=Panel: Brothels aid sex trafficking |author=MARK WAITE |publisher=Pahrump Valley Times |date=2007-09-07 |accessdate=2010-05-09|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071217174035/http%3A//www.pahrumpvalleytimes.com/2007/Sep-07-Fri-2007/news/16519321.html |archivedate = December 17, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous women the world over are particularly targeted for prostitution.  In Canada, New Zealand, Mexico, and Taiwan, studies have shown that indigenous women are at the bottom of the race and class hierarchy of prostitution, often subjected to the worst conditions, most violent demands and sold at the lowest price.&lt;ref name="Lynne"/&gt;  It is common for indigenous women to be over-represented in prostitution when compared with their total population.  This is as a result of the combined forces of colonialism, physical displacement from ancestral lands, destruction of indigenous social and cultural order, misogyny, globalization/neoliberalism, race discrimination and extremely high levels of violence perpetrated against them.&lt;ref name="Lynne"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Farley |first=M. |last2=Lynne |first2=J. |last3=Cotton |first3=A. |title=Prostitution in Vancouver: Violence and the Colonization of First Nations Women |journal=Transcultural Psychiatry |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=242–271 |year=2005 |doi=10.1177/1363461505052667 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on pornography===
{{main|Feminist views of pornography}}
Radical feminists, notably [[Catherine MacKinnon]], charge that the production of pornography entails physical, psychological, and/or economic [[coercion]] of the women who perform and model in it. This is said to be true even when the women are being presented as enjoying themselves.&lt;ref name=stanford-shrage&gt;Shrage, Laurie. (2007-07-13). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-sex-markets/#Por "Feminist Perspectives on Sex Markets: Pornography"]. In: ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mackinnon, Catherine A. (1984) "Not a moral issue." ''Yale Law and Policy Review'' 2:321-345. Reprinted in: Mackinnon (1989). ''Toward a Feminist Theory of the State'' Harvard University Press. ISBN 0-674-89645-9 (1st ed), ISBN 0-674-89646-7 (2nd ed). "Sex forced on real women so that it can be sold at a profit to be forced on other real women; women's bodies trussed and maimed and raped and made into things to be hurt and obtained and accessed, and this presented as the nature of women; the coercion that is visible and the coercion that has become invisible—this and more grounds the feminist concern with pornography"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{Cite episode| title = A Conversation With Catherine MacKinnon (transcript)| series = [[Think Tank]]|network= PBS| accessdate = 2009-09-01| year = 1995| url = http://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript215.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that much of what is shown in pornography is abusive by its very nature. [[Gail Dines]] holds that pornography, exemplified by [[Point of view pornography|gonzo pornography]], is becoming increasingly violent and that women who perform in pornography are brutalized in the process of its production.&lt;ref&gt;Dines, Gail. (2007-03-24). "[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5003155114018800220# Pornography &amp; Pop Culture: Putting the Text in Context]" Presentation at: ''Pornography &amp; Pop Culture - Rethinking Theory, Reframing Activism''. Wheelock College, Boston, March 24, 2007. Archived at [[Google Video]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Dines| first = Gail.| title = Penn, Porn and Me| work = [[CounterPunch]]| accessdate = 2009-09-06| date = 2008-06-23| url = http://www.counterpunch.org/dines06232008.html}} "The porn that makes most of the money for the industry is actually the gonzo, body-punishing variety that shows women’s bodies being physically stretched to the limit, humiliated and degraded. Even porn industry people commented in a recent article in Adult Video News, that gonzo porn is taking its toll on the women, and the turnover is high because they can’t stand the brutal acts on the body for very long."&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical feminists point to the testimony of well known participants in pornography, such as [[Traci Lords]] and [[Linda Boreman]], and argue that most female performers are coerced into pornography, either by somebody else, or by an unfortunate set of circumstances. The feminist anti-pornography movement was galvanized by the publication of ''Ordeal'', in which Linda Boreman (who under the name of "Linda Lovelace" had starred in ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'') stated that she had been beaten, raped, and [[pimp]]ed by her husband [[Chuck Traynor]], and that Traynor had forced her at gunpoint to make scenes in ''Deep Throat'', as well as forcing her, by use of both physical violence against Boreman as well as emotional abuse and outright threats of violence, to make other pornographic films. Dworkin, MacKinnon, and Women Against Pornography issued public statements of support for Boreman, and worked with her in public appearances and speeches.&lt;ref&gt;Brownmiller, ''In Our Time'', p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical feminists hold the view that pornography contributes to [[sexism]], arguing that in pornographic performances the actresses are reduced to mere receptacles—objects—for sexual use and abuse by men. They argue that the narrative is usually formed around men's pleasure as the only goal of sexual activity, and that the women are shown in a subordinate role. Some opponents believe pornographic films tend to show women as being extremely passive, or that the acts which are performed on the women are typically abusive and solely for the pleasure of their sex partner. On-face ejaculation and anal sex are increasingly popular among men, following trends in porn.&lt;ref name="GailDines-JulieBindel-PornIndustry"&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/02/gail-dines-pornography Bindel, Julie, ''The Truth About the Porn Industry: Gail Dines, the Author of an Explosive New Book About the Sex Industry, on Why Pornography Has Never Been a Greater Threat to Our Relationships'', in ''The'' (U.K.) ''Guardian'', Jul. 2, 2010, section ''Life &amp; Style'', subsection ''Women''], as accessed Jul. 17, 2010 (Wikipedia has an article about [[Julie Bindel]]).&lt;/ref&gt; MacKinnon and Dworkin defined pornography as "the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures or words".&lt;ref name=mackinnon-fu&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harvard University Press.

Radical feminists say that consumption of pornography is a cause of [[rape]] and other forms of [[violence against women]]. [[Robin Morgan]] summarizes this idea with her often-quoted statement, "Pornography is the theory, and rape is the practice."&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Robin. (1974). "Theory and Practice: Pornography and Rape". In: ''Going Too Far: The Personal Chronicle of a Feminist''. (1977). Random House. 333 p. ISBN 0-394-48227-1. (1978 ed, ISBN 0-394-72612-X.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical feminists charge that pornography eroticizes the domination, humiliation, and coercion of women, and reinforces sexual and cultural attitudes that are complicit in [[rape]] and [[sexual harassment]]. MacKinnon argued that pornography leads to an increase in sexual violence against women through fostering [[Rape#Victim blaming|rape myth]]s. Such rape myths include the belief that women really want to be raped and that they mean yes when they say no. Additionally, according to MacKinnon, pornography desensitizes viewers to violence against women, and this leads to a progressive need to see more violence in order to become sexually aroused, an effect she claims is well documented.&lt;ref name=mackinnon-guardian&gt;{{Cite news| last = Jeffries| first = Stuart.| title = Are women human?

[[Germany|German]] [[radical feminist]] [[Alice Schwarzer]] is one proponent of the point of view according to which pornography gives a distorted view of men and women's bodies, as well as the actual sexual act, often showing the performers with synthetic implants or exaggerated expressions of pleasure, as well as fetishes that are not the norm, such as [[urophilia|watersports]], being presented as popular and normal.

== Relation to Marxism ==
{{Disputed-section|date=November 2009}}
Some strains of radical feminism have been compared to [[Marxism]] in that they describe a "great struggle of history"&lt;ref name=TowardTheoryState-3&gt;{{Cite book|title=Toward a Feminist Theory of the State|author=Catherine MacKinnon}}, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; between two opposed forces. Much like the Marxist struggle between [[social class|classes]] (typically, with reference to the present day, the [[proletariat]] and [[bourgeoisie]]), radical feminism describes a historical struggle between "women" and "men". Radical feminism has had a close, if sometimes hostile, relationship with Marxism since its origins.&lt;ref name=Willis-121 /&gt; Both Marxists and radical feminists seek a total and radical change in social relations and consider themselves to be on the political [[left-wing politics|left]]. Despite this commonality, as ideologies Marxism and radical feminism have generally opposed one another;{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} radical feminism can be contrasted to [[socialist feminism]] in this respect. In practice, however, activist alliances generally form around shared immediate goals.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Some radical feminists are explicitly avowed Marxists, and attempt to explore relationships between patriarchal and class analysis. This strain of radical feminism can trace its roots to the [[Second International]] (in particular, the Marxists [[Rosa Luxembourg]] and [[Alexandra Kollontai]]). These strains of radical feminism are often referred to as "[[Marxist feminism]]".{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Other radical feminists have criticized Marxists; during the 1960s in the U.S., many women became feminists because they perceived women as being excluded from, and discriminated against by, leftist political groups.&lt;ref&gt;Echols, pp. 135–137.&lt;/ref&gt;

A dispute began in 1973, when the [[West Coast Lesbian Conference]] split over a scheduled performance by the [[transgender]] folksinger Beth Elliott.&lt;ref name="newyorker"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/04/woman-2 | title=What Is a Woman?

In 1979 [[Janice Raymond]] released the book ''The Transsexual Empire'', which she framed as a critique of a patriarchal medical and psychiatric establishment. [[Sheila Jeffreys]] argues that [[transsexualism|transgenderism]] is not immutable and thus does not warrant radical medical intervention, considers detransitioners to be evidence of this, and describes [[Sex reassignment surgery|genital reassignment surgery]] as "mutilation".&lt;ref name="newyorker"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/04/woman-2 | title=What Is a Woman?

== Criticism ==
{{criticism section|date=September 2014}}
Within the New Left, radical feminists were accused of being "bourgeois", "antileft", or even "apolitical", whereas they saw themselves as further "radicalizing the left by expanding the definition of radical".&lt;ref name=Willis-120&gt;Willis, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Radical feminists have tended to be white and middle class. Ellen Willis hypothesized in 1984 that this was, at least in part, because "most black and working-class women could not accept the abstraction of feminist issues from race and class issues";&lt;ref name=Willis-122 /&gt; the resulting narrow demographic base, in turn, limited the validity of generalizations based on radical feminists' personal experiences of gender relations.&lt;ref name=Willis-122 /&gt; Many early radical feminists broke political ties with "male-dominated left groups",&lt;ref name=Willis-120 /&gt; or would work with them only in ''ad hoc'' coalitions.&lt;ref name=Willis-120 /&gt;

[[Betty Friedan]], [[Camille Paglia]], and other [[liberal feminists]] often see precisely the radicalism of radical feminism as potentially undermining the gains of the women's movement with polarizing rhetoric that invites backlash and hold that they overemphasize sexual politics at the expense of political reform.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Other critics of radical feminism from the political left, including [[socialist feminists]], strongly disagree with the radical feminist position that the oppression of women is the most fundamental form of oppression, one that cuts across boundaries of race, culture, and economic class; these critics hold that issues of race and of class are as important or more important than issues about sex.

Some feminists, most notably [[Alice Echols]] and [[Ellen Willis]], held that after about 1975&lt;ref name=Willis-118 /&gt; most of what continued to be called "radical feminism" represents a narrow subset of what was originally a more ideologically diverse movement. Willis saw this as an example of a "conservative retrenchment"&lt;ref name=Willis-119 /&gt; that occurred when the "expansive prosperity and utopian optimism of the '60s succumbed to an era of economic limits and political backlash."&lt;ref name=Willis-119 /&gt; They label this dominant tendency "[[cultural feminism]]"&lt;ref name=Willis-118 /&gt; and view it as a "neo-Victorian"&lt;ref name=Willis-143&gt;Willis, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; ideology coming out of radical feminism but ultimately antithetical to it.&lt;ref name=Willis-cultural-vs-radical&gt;Willis, p. 117. "[Cultural feminists] see the primary goal of feminism as freeing women from the imposition of so-called 'male values,' and creating an alternative culture based on 'female values.'"&lt;/ref&gt; Willis drew the contrast that early radical feminism saw itself as part of a broad left politics, whereas much of what succeeded it in the 1970s and early 1980s (both cultural feminism and liberal feminism) took the attitude that "left politics were 'male' and could be safely ignored."&lt;ref name=Willis-137&gt;Willis, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; She further wrote that whereas the original radical feminism "challenge[d] the polarization of the sexes",&lt;ref name=Willis-143 /&gt; cultural feminism simply embraces the "traditional [[femininity|feminine]] virtues".&lt;ref name=Willis-143 /&gt; Critics of cultural feminism hold that cultural feminist ideas on sexuality, exemplified by the feminist [[anti-pornography movement]], severely polarized feminism, leading to the [[feminist sex wars]] of the 1980s. Critics of Echols and Willis hold that they conflate several tendencies within radical feminism, not all of which are properly called "cultural feminism" and that cultural feminism is not radical feminism, and emphasize a greater continuity between early and contemporary radical feminism.

Also, Willis, although very much a part of early radical feminism and continuing to hold that it played a necessary role in placing feminism on the political agenda, later criticised its inability "to integrate a feminist perspective with an overall radical politics,"&lt;ref name=Willis-120 /&gt; while viewing this limitation as inevitable in the historical context of the times.&lt;ref name=Willis-120 /&gt; In part this limitation arose from the fact that consciousness raising, as "the primary method of understanding women's condition"&lt;ref name=Willis-121&gt;Willis, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; in the movement at this time and its "most successful organizing tool",&lt;ref name=Willis-121 /&gt; led to an emphasis on personal experience that concealed "prior political and philosophical assumptions".&lt;ref name=Willis-121 /&gt;

Willis, writing in 1984, was critical of the notion that all hierarchies are "more specialized forms of male supremacy"&lt;ref name=Willis-123 /&gt; as preventing adequate consideration of the possibility that "the impulse to dominate… could be a universal human characteristic that women share, even if they have mostly lacked the opportunity to exercise it."&lt;ref name=Willis-123 /&gt; Further, the view of oppression of women as a "transhistorical phenomenon"&lt;ref name=Willis-122 /&gt; allowed middle-class white women to minimize the benefits of their own race and class privilege and tended to exclude women from history.&lt;ref name=Willis-123 /&gt; Further, Willis wrote that the movement never developed "a coherent analysis of either male or female psychology"&lt;ref name=Willis-134etseq&gt;Willis, p. 134 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; and that it ultimately raised hopes that its narrow "commitment to the sex-class paradigm"&lt;ref name=Willis-134etseq /&gt; could not fulfill; when those hopes were dashed, according to Willis the resulting despair was the foundation of withdrawal into [[counterculture|counterculturalism]] and [[cultural feminism]].&lt;ref name=Willis-134etseq /&gt;

Holly Hall Carter, the former executive director of the conservative college women's organization [[Network of enlightened Women|Network of enlightened Women (NeW)]] and author [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] have argued that radical feminism promotes a [[victim mentality]] amongst young women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goizueta|first=Cristina|title=Who Is Saving Feminism?|url=http://www.insideronline.org/feature.cfm?id=298|publisher=Insider Online|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Forbes contributor Susannah Breslin wrote "Feminism claims to be about empowerment. In fact, over the years, it has increasingly devoted itself to promoting the image of women as victims. Victims of men. Victims of pop culture. Victims of sexism. Victims of discrimination. Victims of other women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Breslin|first=Susannah|title=How Feminism Became a Joke|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/susannahbreslin/2011/08/11/how-feminism-became-a-joke/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
