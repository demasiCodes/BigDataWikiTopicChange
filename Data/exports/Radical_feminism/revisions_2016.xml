'''Radical feminism''' is a perspective within [[feminism]] that calls for a radical reordering of society in which [[androcentrism|male supremacy]] is eliminated in all social and economic contexts.&lt;ref name=Willis-117&gt;Willis, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical feminists seek to abolish [[patriarchy]] by challenging existing social norms and institutions, rather than through a purely political process. This includes challenging the notion of traditional [[gender role]]s, opposing the [[sexual objectification]] of women, and raising public awareness about such issues as [[rape]] and [[violence against women]].

Early radical feminism, arising within [[second-wave feminism]] in the 1960s,&lt;ref name=Willis-118&gt;Willis, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; typically viewed patriarchy as a "transhistorical phenomenon"&lt;ref name=Willis-122&gt;Willis, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; prior to or deeper than other sources of [[oppression]], "not only the oldest and most universal form of domination but the primary form"&lt;ref name=Willis-123&gt;Willis, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; and the model for all others.&lt;ref name=Willis-123 /&gt; Later politics derived from radical feminism ranged from [[cultural feminism]]&lt;ref name=Willis-117 /&gt; to more [[syncretism|syncretic]] politics that placed issues of [[social class|class]], [[economics]], etc. on a par with patriarchy as sources of oppression.&lt;ref name=Willis-141&gt;Willis, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical feminists locate the root cause of women's oppression in patriarchal gender relations, as opposed to [[legal system]]s (as in [[liberal feminism]]) or [[class conflict]] (as in [[anarchist feminism]], [[socialist feminism]], and [[Marxist feminism]]).

== Theory and ideology ==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2007}}
Radical feminists assert that society is a [[patriarchy]] in which the class of men are the oppressors of the class of women.&lt;ref&gt;Echols, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; They posit that because of patriarchy, women have come to be viewed as the "other" to the male norm and as such have been systematically oppressed and marginalized. They furthermore assert that men as a class, benefit from the oppression of women. Radical feminists seek to abolish patriarchy, and believe that the way to do this and to deal with oppression of any kind is to address the underlying causes of it through revolution.

While some radical feminists propose that the oppression of women is the most fundamental form of oppression, one that cuts across boundaries of all other forms of oppression, others acknowledge the simultaneous and [[Intersectionality|intersecting]] effect of other independent categories of oppression. These other categories of oppression may include, but are not limited to, oppression based on [[racism|race]], [[classism|social class]], [[lookism|perceived attractiveness]], [[heterosexism|sexual orientation]], and [[ableism|ability]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Patriarchal theory is not generally defined as a belief that all men always benefit from the oppression of all women. Rather, patriarchal theory maintains that the primary element of patriarchy is a relationship of dominance, where one party is dominant and exploits the other party for the benefit of the former. Radical feminists believe that men (as a class) use social systems and other methods of control to keep women (and non-dominant men) suppressed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Radical feminists also believe that eliminating patriarchy, and other systems which perpetuate the domination of one group over another, will liberate everyone from an unjust society.

== Movement ==

=== Roots ===
The ideology of radical feminism in the United States developed as a component of the [[women's liberation movement]]. It grew largely due to the influence of the civil rights movement, that had gained momentum in the 1960s, and many of the women who took up the cause of radical feminism had previous experience with radical protest in the struggle against racism. Chronologically, it can be seen within the context of [[second wave feminism]] that started in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Gamble, ed. The Routledge companion to feminism and postfeminism (2001) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The primary players and the pioneers of this second wave of feminism included [[Shulamith Firestone]], [[Kathie Sarachild]], [[Ti-Grace Atkinson]], [[Carol Hanisch]], and [[Judith C. Brown|Judith Brown]]. Many local women's groups in the late sixties, such as the UCLA Women's Liberation Front (WLF), offered diplomatic statements of radical feminism's ideologies. UCLA's WLF co-founder Devra Weber recalls, "'... the radical feminists were opposed to patriarchy, but not necessarily capitalism. In our group at least, they opposed so-called male dominated national liberation struggles'".&lt;ref&gt;Linden-Ward &amp; Green, p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt; "Radical feminism had a "powerful influence" on the "women's movement" and played a tremendous role "in shaping feminist politics" (Willis, xi).

These women helped secure the bridge that translated radical protest for racial equality over to the struggle for [[women's rights]]; by witnessing the discrimination and oppression to which the black population was subjected, they were able to gain strength and motivation to do the same for their fellow women. They took up the cause and advocated for a variety of women's issues, including [[abortion]], the Equal Rights Amendment, access to credit, and equal pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Sara M.|title=Re-Viewing the Second Wave|journal=Feminist Studies|date=Summer 2002|volume=28|issue=2|pages=258–267|doi=10.2307/3178740|jstor=3178740}}&lt;/ref&gt; They failed to stir up enough interest among most of the women's fringe groups of society.{{clarify|date=March 2015}} Most women of color (who were predominantly working-class) did not participate in the formation of the radical feminist movement because it did not address many issues that were relevant to those from a working-class background.&lt;ref&gt;Linden-Ward &amp; Green, p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt; But for those who felt compelled enough to stand up for the cause, radical action was needed, and so they took to the streets and formed [[consciousness raising]] groups to rally support for the cause and recruit people who would be willing to fight for it. Later on, Second Wave radical feminism saw greater numbers of black feminists and other women of color participating.

In the 1960s, radical feminism emerged simultaneously within liberal feminist and working class feminist discussions, first in the United States, then in the United Kingdom and Australia. Those involved had gradually come to believe that it was not only the [[middle-class]] [[nuclear family]] which oppressed women, but that it was also social movements and organizations that claimed to stand for human liberation, notably the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], the [[New Left]], and [[Marxism|Marxist]] political parties, all of which they considered to be male-dominated and male-oriented. Women in countercultural groups related that the gender relations present in such groups were very much those of mainstream culture.

In the United States, radical feminism developed as a response to some of the perceived failings of both [[New Left]] organizations such as the [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) and feminist organizations such as NOW.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Initially concentrated in big cities like New York, Chicago, Boston, Washington, DC, and on the West Coast,&lt;ref&gt;Willis, p. 118. Willis doesn't mention Chicago, but as early as 1967 Chicago was a major site for consciousness-raising and home of the ''Voice of Women's Liberation Movement''; see Kate Bedford and Ara Wilson [http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/wilson935/chrono1.htm Lesbian Feminist Chronology: 1963-1970], accessed online 8 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; radical feminist groups spread across the country rapidly from 1968 to 1972.

In the United Kingdom, feminism developed out of discussions within community based radical women's organizations and discussions by women within the [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] left.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Radical feminism was imported into the UK by American radical feminists and seized on by British radical women as offering an exciting new theory to replace [[Trotskyism]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} As the 1970s progressed, British feminists split into two major schools of thought: [[socialist feminism|socialist]] and radical.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} In 1977, another split occurred, with a third grouping calling itself "revolutionary feminism" breaking away from the other two.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Australian radical feminism developed slightly later, during an extended period of social radicalization, largely as an expression of that radicalization.

Radical feminists introduced the use of [[consciousness raising]] (CR) groups. These groups brought together intellectuals, workers, and middle class women in developed Western countries to discuss their experiences. During these discussions, women noted a shared and repressive system regardless of their political affiliation or social class. Based on these discussions, the women drew the conclusion that ending of patriarchy was the most necessary step towards a truly free society. These consciousness-raising sessions allowed early radical feminists to develop a political [[ideology]] based on common experiences women faced with male supremacy. Consciousness raising was extensively used in chapter sub-units of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) during the 1970s. The feminism that emerged from these discussions stood first and foremost for the liberation of women, as women, from the oppression of men in their own lives, as well as men in power. Radical feminism claimed that a totalizing ideology and social formation – ''patriarchy'' (government or rule by fathers) – dominated women in the interests of men.

Within groups such as [[New York Radical Women]] (1967–1969; no relation to the present-day socialist feminist organization [[Radical Women]]), which Ellen Willis characterized as "the first women's liberation group in New York City",&lt;ref name=Willis-119&gt;Willis, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; a radical feminist ideology began to emerge that declared that "the personal is political"&lt;ref name=Willis-118 /&gt; and "sisterhood is powerful",&lt;ref name=Willis-118 /&gt; formulations that arose from these consciousness-raising sessions. New York Radical Women fell apart in early 1969 in what came to be known as the "politico-feminist split"&lt;ref name=Willis-119 /&gt; with the "politicos"&lt;ref name=Willis-119 /&gt; seeing capitalism as the source of women's oppression, while the "feminists"&lt;ref name=Willis-119 /&gt; saw male supremacy as "a set of material, institutionalized relations, not just bad attitudes."&lt;ref name=Willis-119 /&gt; The feminist side of the split, which soon began referring to itself as "radical feminists",&lt;ref name=Willis-119 /&gt; soon constituted the basis of a new organization, [[Redstockings]]. At the same time, Ti-Grace Atkinson led "a radical split-off from NOW",&lt;ref name=Willis-124&gt;Willis, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; which became known as [[The Feminists]].&lt;ref name=Willis-124 /&gt; A third major stance would be articulated by the [[New York Radical Feminists]], founded later in 1969 by [[Shulamith Firestone]] (who broke from the Redstockings) and [[Anne Koedt]].&lt;ref name=Willis-133&gt;Willis, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, the movement produced "a prodigious output of leaflets, pamphlets, journals, magazine articles, newspaper and radio and TV interviews."&lt;ref name=Willis-118 /&gt; Many important feminist works, such as Koedt's essay ''[[The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm]]'' (1970) and [[Kate Millet]]'s book ''[[Sexual Politics]]'' (1970), emerged during this time and in this [[Social environment|milieu]].

=== Ideology emerges and diverges ===
At the beginning of this period, "[[heterosexuality]] was more or less an unchallenged assumption."&lt;ref name=Willis-121 /&gt; Among radical feminists, the view became widely held that, thus far, the sexual freedoms gained in the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s, in particular, the decreasing emphasis on [[monogamy]], had been largely gained by men at women's expense.&lt;ref name=Willis-121 /&gt; This assumption of heterosexuality would soon be challenged by the rise of [[political lesbianism]], closely associated with Atkinson and The Feminists.&lt;ref name=Willis-131&gt;Willis, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; The belief that the sexual revolution was a victory of men over women would eventually lead to the women's anti-pornography movement of the late 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Redstockings and The Feminists were both radical feminist organizations, but held rather distinct views. Most members of Redstockings held to a [[materialism|materialist]] and anti-[[psychologism|psychologistic]] view. They viewed men's oppression of women as ongoing and deliberate, holding individual men responsible for this oppression, viewing institutions and systems (including the [[family]]) as mere vehicles of conscious male intent, and rejecting psychologistic explanations of female submissiveness as blaming women for collaboration in their own oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Willis, pp. 124–126.&lt;/ref&gt; They held to a view – which Willis would later describe as "neo-[[Maoism|Maoist]]"&lt;ref name=Willis-124 /&gt; – that it would be possible to unite all or virtually all women, as a class, to confront this oppression by personally confronting men.&lt;ref name=Willis-128&gt;Willis, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Feminists held a more [[idealism|idealistic]], psychologistic, and [[utopianism|utopian]] philosophy, with a greater emphasis on "[[sex role]]s",&lt;ref name=Willis-130-132&gt;Willis, pp. 130–132.&lt;/ref&gt; seeing [[sexism]] as rooted in "complementary patterns of male and female behavior".&lt;ref name=Willis-130-132 /&gt; They placed more emphasis on institutions, seeing marriage, family, prostitution, and heterosexuality as all existing to perpetuate the "sex-role system".&lt;ref name=Willis-130-132 /&gt; They saw all of these as institutions to be destroyed. Within the group, there were further disagreements, such as Koedt's viewing the institution of "normal"&lt;ref name=Willis-130-132 /&gt; sexual intercourse as being focused mainly on male sexual or erotic pleasure, while Atkinson viewed it mainly in terms of reproduction.&lt;ref name=Willis-130-132 /&gt; In contrast to the Redstockings, The Feminists generally considered genitally focused sexuality to be inherently male.&lt;ref name=Willis-132&gt;Willis, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellen Willis would later write that insofar as the Redstockings considered abandoning heterosexual activity, they saw it as a "bitter price"&lt;ref name=Willis-132 /&gt; they "might have to pay for [their] militance",&lt;ref name=Willis-132 /&gt; whereas The Feminists embraced [[separatist feminism]] as a strategy.&lt;ref name=Willis-132 /&gt;

The New York Radical Feminists (NYRF) took a more psychologistic (and even [[biological determinism|biologically determinist]]) line. They argued that men dominated women not so much for material benefits as for the ego satisfaction intrinsic in domination. Similarly, they rejected the Redstockings view that women submitted only out of necessity or The Feminists' implicit view that they submitted out of cowardice, but instead argued that social conditioning simply led most women to accept a submissive role as "right and natural".&lt;ref&gt;Willis, pp. 133–134.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Action ===
Radical feminism was not and is not only a movement of ideology and theory. Radical feminists also take [[direct action]]. In 1968, they protested against the [[Miss America]] pageant in order to bring "sexist beauty ideas and social expectations" to the forefront of women's social issues.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Kreydatus, Beth. "Confronting The Bra-Burners" Teaching Radical Feminism With A Case Study"|journal=History Teacher Academic Search Complete|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though there weren't any bra's burned on that day, this protest is famous for the phrase "bra-burner".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; "Feminsts threw their bras—along with "woman-garbage" such as girdles, false eyelashes, steno pads, wigs, women's magazines, and dishcloths—into a "Freedom Trash Can," but they did not set it on fire".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1970, more than one hundred feminists staged an 11 hour sit-in at the ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; These women demanded that the editor "be removed and replaced by a woman editor".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Hunter, Jean|title=A Daring New Concept: The Ladies Home Journal And Modern Feminism|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ladies Home journal, "with their emphasis on food, family, fashion, and femininity, played an important role in maintaining the status quo and thus were instruments of women's oppression".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; One member explains the motivation of the protest noting that they "were there to destroy a publication which feeds of of women's anger and frustration, a magazine which destroys women.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition, they "used a variety of tactics-demonstrations and speakouts"&lt;ref name=Willis-117/&gt; about topics such as rape.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through "tireless[ly] organizing among friends and coworkers, on street corners, in supermarkets and ladies' rooms" these radical feminists were able gain an amazing amount of exposure".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The movement gained momentum, while a "prodigious output of leaflets, pamphlets, journals, magazine articles, newspaper and radio and TV interviews" were produced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Radical egalitarianism ===
Radical egalitarianism, "an approach to the distribution of economic resources", aimed to "diminish differences among people" based on "culture or a way of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Wildavsky, Aaron. "The Rise Of Radical Egalitarianism and The Fall Of Academic Standards"|journal=Academic Search Complete|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their commitment to [[radical egalitarianism]], most early radical feminist groups operated initially without any formal internal structure. When informal leadership developed, it was often resented. Some of the feminist leaders reacted with defiance, some quit the movement", and "others tried to respond to the criticism by echoing it and withdrawing from [their] leadership roles, in classic guilty liberal fashion".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many groups ended up expending more effort debating their own internal operations than dealing with external matters, seeking to "perfect a perfect society in microcosm"&lt;ref name=Willis-138-140&gt;Willis, pp. 138–140.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than focus on the larger world. Resentment of leadership was compounded by the view that all "class striving"&lt;ref name=Willis-138-140 /&gt; was "male-identified".&lt;ref name=Willis-138-140 /&gt; In the extreme, exemplified by The Feminists, the upshot, according to Ellen Willis, was "unworkable, mechanistic demands for an absolutely random division of labor, taking no account of differences in skill, experience, or even inclination".&lt;ref name=Willis-138-140 /&gt; "The result," writes Willis, "was not democracy but paralysis."&lt;ref name=Willis-138-140 /&gt; When The Feminists began to select randomly who could talk to the press, Ti-Grace Atkinson quit the organization she had founded. Willis believed that part of the reason the problems weren't dealt with was because "of the unconscious fear that feminists' demands for freedom and power would provoke devastating retribution".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When The Feminists began to select randomly who could talk to the press, Ti-Grace Atkinson quit the organization she had founded.&lt;ref name=Willis-138-140 /&gt;

=== Social organization and aims in the U.S. and Australia ===
Radical feminists have generally formed small activist or community associations around either consciousness raising or concrete aims. Many radical feminists in Australia participated in a series of [[squatting|squats]] to establish various women's centers, and this form of action was common in the late 1970s and early 1980s. By the mid-1980s many of the original consciousness raising groups had dissolved, and radical feminism was more and more associated with loosely organized university collectives. Radical feminism can still be seen, particularly within student activism and among working class women.

In Australia, many feminist social organizations accepted government funding during the 1980s, and the election of a conservative government in 1996 crippled these organizations.

While radical feminists aim to dismantle patriarchal society in a historical sense, their immediate aims are generally concrete. Some common demands include:

* Expanding [[reproductive rights]].
*:{{quote|Defined by feminists in the 1970s as a basic human right, it includes the right to abortion and birth control, but implies much more. To be realised, reproductive freedom must include not only woman's right to choose childbirth, abortion, sterilisation or birth control, but also her right to make those choices freely, without pressure from individual men, doctors, governmental or religious authorities. It is a key issue for women, since without it the other freedoms we appear to have, such as the right to education, jobs and equal pay, may prove illusory. Provisions of childcare, medical treatment, and society's attitude towards children are also involved.&lt;ref&gt;From ''The Encyclopedia of Feminism'' (1986) Lisa Tuttle&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* Changing the organizational sexual culture, e.g., breaking down traditional gender roles and reevaluating societal concepts of femininity and masculinity (a common demand in US universities during the 1980s). In this, they often form tactical alliances with other currents of feminism.

===Views on prostitution===
{{main article|Feminist views on prostitution}} 
Radical feminists argue that, in most cases, prostitution is not a conscious and calculated choice.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}  They say that most women who become prostitutes do so because they were forced or coerced by a pimp or by human trafficking, or, when it is an independent decision, it is generally the result of extreme poverty and lack of opportunity, or of serious underlying problems, such as drug addiction, past trauma (such as child sexual abuse) and other unfortunate circumstances.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Radical feminists point out that women from the lowest socioeconomic classes – impoverished women, women with a low level of education, women from the most disadvantaged racial and ethnic minorities – are overrepresented in prostitution all over the world. "If prostitution is a free choice, why are the women with the fewest choices the ones most often found doing it?" (MacKinnon, 1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/fempsy3.html |title=Prostitution in Five Countries |publisher=Feminism &amp; Psychology |year=1998 |authors=Melissa Farley, Isin Baral, Merab Kiremire and Ufuk Sezgin|pages=405–426 |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large percentage of prostitutes polled in one study of 475 people involved in prostitution reported that they were in a difficult period of their lives and most wanted to leave the occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Farley, Melissa.

[[Catharine MacKinnon]] argues that "In prostitution, women have sex with men they would never otherwise have sex with. The money thus acts as a form of force, not as a measure of consent. It acts like physical force does in rape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpbn.org/program/intelligence-squared/episode/its-wrong-pay-sex |title=It's Wrong to Pay for Sex |author= |date=5 August 2009 |work= |publisher=Connecticut Public Radio |accessdate=8 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They believe no person can be said to truly consent to their own oppression and no people should have the right to consent to the oppression of others.  In the words of [[Kathleen Barry]], consent is not a "good divining rod as to the existence of oppression, and consent to violation is a fact of oppression.  Oppression cannot effectively be gauged according to the degree of "consent," since even in slavery there was some consent, if consent is defined as inability to see, or feel any alternative."&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;Barry, K "The Prostitution of Sexuality: The Global Exploitation of Women" New York: NYU Press 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrea Dworkin]] stated her opinions as: "Prostitution in and of itself is an abuse of a woman's body. Those of us who say this are accused of being simple-minded. But prostitution is very simple. ... In prostitution, no woman stays whole. It is impossible to use a human body in the way women's bodies are used in prostitution and to have a whole human being at the end of it, or in the middle of it, or close to the beginning of it. It's impossible. And no woman gets whole again later, after."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/MichLawJourI.html |title=Prostitution and Male Supremacy (1 of 2) |publisher=Nostatusquo.com |date=1992-10-31 |author=Andrea Dworkin |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dworkin argues that "prostitution and equality for women cannot exist simultaneously" and in order to eradicate prostitution "we must seek ways to use words and law to end the abusive selling and buying of girls' and women's bodies for men's sexual pleasure".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Hoffer, Kaethe Morris.

Radical feminist thinking has analyzed prostitution as a cornerstone of patriarchal domination and sexual subjugation of women that impacts negatively not only on the women and girls in prostitution but on all women as a group because prostitution continually affirms and reinforces patriarchal definitions of women as having a primary function to serve men sexually. They claim it is crucial that society does not replace one patriarchal view on female sexuality – e.g., that women should not have sex outside marriage/a relationship and that casual sex is shameful for a woman, etc. – with another similarly oppressive and patriarchal view – acceptance of prostitution, a sexual practice which is based on a highly patriarchal construct of sexuality: that the sexual pleasure of a woman is irrelevant, that her only role during sex is to submit to the man's sexual demands and to do what he tells her, that sex should be controlled by the man and that the woman's response and satisfaction are irrelevant.  These feminists argue that sexual liberation for women cannot be achieved as long as we normalize unequal sexual practices where a man dominates a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catw-ap.org/resources/speeches-papers/sex-from-human-intimacy-to-sexual-labor-or-is-prostitution-a-human-right/ |title=SEX: From human intimacy to "sexual labor" or Is prostitution a human right? |author=Cecilia Hofmann |publisher=CATW-Asia Pacific |date = August 1997|accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Feminist consciousness raising remains the foundation for collective struggle and the eventual liberation of women".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Polis, Carol A.

They see prostitution as a form of male dominance, as it puts the woman in a subordinate position, reducing her to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}  These feminists believe that many clients use the services of prostitutes because they enjoy the "power trip" they derive from the act and the control they have over the woman during the sexual activity. [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argues that prostitution "isn't sex only, it's you do what I say, sex."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://intelligencesquaredus.org/wp-content/uploads/ItsWrongToPayForSex-042109.pdf |title=It's wrong to pay for sex |author= |date=22 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410163348/http://intelligencesquaredus.org/wp-content/uploads/ItsWrongToPayForSex-042109.pdf | archivedate=10 April 2011 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Sex is seen as 'a social product of culture, a political product of gender hierarchy, and these are the conditions of male power".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Radical feminists strongly object to the [[patriarchal]] ideology which has been one of the justifications for the existence of prostitution throughout history (and which they say continues to justify it in many cultures), that is, that prostitution is a "necessary evil", as men cannot control themselves, and thus it is "necessary" that a small number of women be "sacrificed" to be used and abused by men, in order to protect "chaste" women from rape and harassment. These feminists see prostitution as a form of slavery, and say that, far from decreasing rape rates, prostitution leads to a sharp ''increase'' in sexual violence against women, by sending the message that it is acceptable for a man to treat a woman as a sexual instrument over which he has total control. [[Melissa Farley]] argues that Nevada's high rape rate is connected to legal prostitution because Nevada is the only US state which allows legal brothels and is ranked 4th out of the 50 U.S. states for sexual assault crimes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inner-star.org/sexualassaultprevention.html |title=Sexual Assault Prevention Program at ISPAN |publisher=Inner-star.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying, "Nevada's rape rate is higher than the U.S. average and way higher than the rape rate in California, New York and New Jersey. Why is this? Legal prostitution creates an atmosphere in this state in which women are not humans equal to them, are disrespected by men, and which then sets the stage of increased violence against women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pahrumpvalleytimes.com/2007/Sep-07-Fri-2007/news/16519321.html |title=Panel: Brothels aid sex trafficking |author=MARK WAITE |publisher=Pahrump Valley Times |date=2007-09-07 |accessdate=2010-05-09|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217174035/http%3A//www.pahrumpvalleytimes.com/2007/Sep-07-Fri-2007/news/16519321.html |archivedate = December 17, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous women the world over are particularly targeted for prostitution."The early 1970s witnessed the rise of a vastly expanding sex industry, and soon evidence emerged that women were being brought from developing countries to provide sexual services for male clients in the affluent Western nations. Since then—partly due to improved transportation and communication networks—migration and trafficking have grown immensely on a worldwide scale".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Outshoorn, J. "The Political Debates on Prostitution and the Trafficking of Women"|journal=Social Politics: International Studies in Gender, State and Society|volume=12| issue =  1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Canada, New Zealand, Mexico, and Taiwan, studies have shown that indigenous women are at the bottom of the race and class hierarchy of prostitution, often subjected to the worst conditions, most violent demands and sold at the lowest price.&lt;ref name="Lynne"/&gt;  It is common for indigenous women to be over-represented in prostitution when compared with their total population.  This is as a result of the combined forces of colonialism, physical displacement from ancestral lands, destruction of indigenous social and cultural order, misogyny, globalization/neoliberalism, race discrimination and extremely high levels of violence perpetrated against them.&lt;ref name="Lynne"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Farley |first=M. |last2=Lynne |first2=J. |last3=Cotton |first3=A. |title=Prostitution in Vancouver: Violence and the Colonization of First Nations Women |journal=Transcultural Psychiatry |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=242–271 |year=2005 |doi=10.1177/1363461505052667 |pmid=16114585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on pornography===
{{main article|Feminist views of pornography}}
Radical feminists, notably [[Catherine MacKinnon]], charge that the production of pornography entails physical, psychological, and/or economic [[coercion]] of the women who perform and model in it. This is said to be true even when the women are being presented as enjoying themselves.&lt;ref name=stanford-shrage&gt;Shrage, Laurie. (2007-07-13). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-sex-markets/#Por "Feminist Perspectives on Sex Markets: Pornography"].

''Toward a Feminist Theory of the State'' Harvard University Press. ISBN 0-674-89645-9 (1st ed), ISBN 0-674-89646-7 (2nd ed). "Sex forced on real women so that it can be sold at a profit to be forced on other real women; women's bodies trussed and maimed and raped and made into things to be hurt and obtained and accessed, and this presented as the nature of women; the coercion that is visible and the coercion that has become invisible—this and more grounds the feminist concern with pornography"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{Cite episode| title = A Conversation With Catherine MacKinnon (transcript)| series = [[Think Tank]]|network= PBS| accessdate = 2009-09-01| year = 1995| url = http://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript215.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that much of what is shown in pornography is abusive by its very nature. [[Gail Dines]] holds that pornography, exemplified by [[Point of view pornography|gonzo pornography]], is becoming increasingly violent and that women who perform in pornography are brutalized in the process of its production.&lt;ref&gt;Dines, Gail.

Even porn industry people commented in a recent article in Adult Video News, that gonzo porn is taking its toll on the women, and the turnover is high because they can't stand the brutal acts on the body for very long."&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical feminists point to the testimony of well known participants in pornography, such as [[Traci Lords]] and [[Linda Boreman]], and argue that most female performers are coerced into pornography, either by somebody else, or by an unfortunate set of circumstances. The feminist anti-pornography movement was galvanized by the publication of ''Ordeal'', in which Linda Boreman (who under the name of "Linda Lovelace" had starred in ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'') stated that she had been beaten, raped, and [[pimp]]ed by her husband [[Chuck Traynor]], and that Traynor had forced her at gunpoint to make scenes in ''Deep Throat'', as well as forcing her, by use of both physical violence against Boreman as well as emotional abuse and outright threats of violence, to make other pornographic films. Dworkin, MacKinnon, and Women Against Pornography issued public statements of support for Boreman, and worked with her in public appearances and speeches.&lt;ref&gt;Brownmiller, ''In Our Time'', p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical feminists hold the view that pornography contributes to sexism, arguing that in pornographic performances the actresses are reduced to mere receptacles – objects – for sexual use and abuse by men. They argue that the narrative is usually formed around men's pleasure as the only goal of sexual activity, and that the women are shown in a subordinate role. Some opponents believe pornographic films tend to show women as being extremely passive, or that the acts which are performed on the women are typically abusive and solely for the pleasure of their sex partner. On-face ejaculation and anal sex are increasingly popular among men, following trends in porn.&lt;ref name="GailDines-JulieBindel-PornIndustry"&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/02/gail-dines-pornography Bindel, Julie, ''The Truth About the Porn Industry: Gail Dines, the Author of an Explosive New Book About the Sex Industry, on Why Pornography Has Never Been a Greater Threat to Our Relationships'', in ''The'' (U.K.) ''Guardian'', Jul. 2, 2010, section ''Life &amp; Style'', subsection ''Women''], as accessed Jul. 17, 2010 (Wikipedia has an article about [[Julie Bindel]]).&lt;/ref&gt; MacKinnon and Dworkin defined pornography as "the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures or words".&lt;ref name=mackinnon-fu&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harvard University Press.

Radical feminists say that consumption of pornography is a cause of [[rape]] and other forms of [[violence against women]]. [[Robin Morgan]] summarizes this idea with her often-quoted statement, "Pornography is the theory, and rape is the practice."&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Robin. (1974). "Theory and Practice: Pornography and Rape". In: ''Going Too Far: The Personal Chronicle of a Feminist''. (1977). Random House. 333 p. ISBN 0-394-48227-1. (1978 ed, ISBN 0-394-72612-X.)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the radical feminist theory, the female gender sexual lacks the sexual greed the masculine gender possesses. "The desire and pleasure of raping, are nothing but an extension of the fantasy and perversion of the male gender in respect to the female sexuality".&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Schussler, Aura. "The Relation Between Feminism And Pornography"|journal=Scientific Journal of Humanistic Studies, Academic Search Complete|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical feminists charge that pornography eroticizes the domination, humiliation, and coercion of women, and reinforces sexual and cultural attitudes that are complicit in rape and [[sexual harassment]]. In her book ''[[Only Words (book)|Only Words]]'', MacKinnon argues that pornography "deprives women of the right to express verbal refusal of an intercourse".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

MacKinnon argued that pornography leads to an increase in sexual violence against women through fostering [[rape myth]]s. Such rape myths include the belief that women really want to be raped and that they mean yes when they say no. It is disputed that "rape myths perpetuate sexual violence indirectly by creating distorted beliefs and attitudes about sexual assault and shift elements of blame onto the victims".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Maxwell, Louise, and Scott. "A Review Of The Role Of Radical Feminist Theories In The Understanding Of Rape Myth Acceptance."|journal=Journal of Sexual Aggression, Academic Search Complete|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, according to MacKinnon, pornography desensitizes viewers to violence against women, and this leads to a progressive need to see more violence in order to become sexually aroused, an effect she claims is well documented.&lt;ref name="mackinnon-guardian"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Jeffries| first = Stuart.| title = Are women human?

German radical feminist [[Alice Schwarzer]] is one proponent of the point of view according to which pornography gives a distorted view of men and women's bodies, as well as the actual sexual act, often showing the performers with synthetic implants or exaggerated expressions of pleasure, as well as fetishes that are not the norm, such as [[urophilia|watersports]], being presented as popular and normal.

==Radical lesbian feminism==
{{Main article|Radical lesbians}}

[[Radical lesbians]] are distinguished from other radical feminists through their ideological roots in political lesbianism. Radical lesbians see [[lesbian]]ism as an act of resistance against the political institution of heterosexuality, which they view as violent and oppressive towards women. Radical lesbians believed that "lesbian identity was a 'woman-identified' identity'".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Poirot, Kristan. Domesticating The Liberated Women: Containment Rhetorics Of Second Wave Radical/lesbian Feminism|journal=Women's Studies In Communication (263-264)|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term "quickly became an anchoring term in their constitutive rhetoric"; however, it is argued that "their woman-identifying rhetorics should be considered rhetorical failures".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This idea "fails as heterosexual women and lesbians of color refused to embrace the separatist ideology" that eventually became associated with "woman-identification discourse".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On top of that, the image of "the shrill, man-hating feminist" was born, a "viable feminist identity" that still exists as a stereotype for feminists today.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1978 the [[Lesbian Organization of Toronto]] voted to become [[womyn-born womyn]] only and wrote: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A woman's voice was almost never heard as a woman's voice – it was always filtered through men's voices. So here a guy comes along saying, "I'm going to be a girl now and speak for girls."

University of Toronto Press, ISBN 978-0-8020-7479-9.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1979 American lesbian radical feminist activist [[Janice Raymond]] released the book ''[[The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male]]'', which looked at the role of transsexuality – particularly psychological and surgical approaches to it – in reinforcing traditional gender stereotypes, the ways in which the "medical-psychiatric complex" has medicalized "gender identity", and the social and political context that helped spawn transsexual treatment and surgery as normal and therapeutic medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raymond|first1=Janice G.|title=The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male|date=1994|publisher=Teachers College Press|location=New York|isbn=0807762725|edition=Reissued with a new introduction on transgender}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Transsexual Empire'' maintains that transsexuality is based on the "patriarchal myths" of "male mothering", and "making of woman according to man's image". Raymond claimed this was done in order "to colonize feminist identification, culture, politics and sexuality", adding: "All transsexuals rape women's bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves .... Transsexuals merely cut off the most obvious means of invading women, so that they seem non-invasive."

In 1999, [[Germaine Greer]] published a sequel to ''The Female Eunuch'', the book ''The Whole Woman''. One chapter was titled "Pantomime Dames", wherein she states her opposition to accepting transsexuals as women:&lt;ref name = "Greer"&gt;Greer, Germaine, (1999), ''The Whole Woman'', Transworld Publishers Ltd, 1999, ISBN 0-385-60016-X, p 64.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Governments that consist of very few women have hurried to recognise as women men who believe that they are women and have had themselves castrated to prove it, because they see women not as another sex but as a non-sex. No so-called sex-change has ever begged for a uterus-and-ovaries transplant; if uterus-and-ovaries transplants were made mandatory for wannabe women they would disappear overnight. The insistence that man-made women be accepted as women is the institutional expression of the mistaken conviction that women are defective males.&lt;ref name="Greer2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Germaine Greer|title=The Whole Woman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ymJArTm2CAIC&amp;pg=PT101|date=22 April 2009|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-56113-8|pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Radical feminists have sometimes advocated for the exclusion of [[trans women]] from feminist events, a source of much controversy.

The term TERF (trans-exclusionary radical feminist) has been used to refer to radical feminists who hold such views,&lt;ref name="newyorker"/&gt; and radical feminists holding these views have been described as members of a [[hate group]] who are allegedly "masquerading as feminists".&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/2013/07/11/the_hate_group_masquerading_as_inclusive_feminists_partner/ | title=The hate group masquerading as feminists | work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]/[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]] | date=July 11, 2013 | accessdate=April 18, 2014 | author=Allen, Samantha | quote = A small but vocal band of activists known as 'Radfems' see transgender women like myself as a blight on the feminist movement, but – because their views are not representative of the feminist movement as a whole – many trans*-inclusive feminists refer to them as TERFs, or Trans*-Exclusionary Radical Feminists.}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The TERF idea is that sex is entirely binary, that the oppression of women is entirely based on that binary difference; that gender is a malign fiction created by a patriarchy that exists wholly and solely to oppress women as a class".&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kaveney, Roz|title=Woman Enough|journal=Academic Search Complete|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is considered a [[pejorative|slur]] by those at whom it is directed.&lt;ref name="newyorker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bitchmedia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/08/02/sex-is-not-gender/ | title=Sex is Not Gender | publisher=[[CounterPunch]] | date=2–4 August 2013 | accessdate=10 August 2014 | author=Hungerford, Elizabeth | quote=Make no mistake, this is a slur.

West didn't have the time to check: avoiding any association with a tainted form of feminism took precedence over sharing a message about domestic violence. And she acted perfectly rationally in this: to associate herself with me, even by merely [[retweet|RTing]] a statement she agreed with, could be enough to make her a "known TERF" in turn and lead to her being similarly denounced in public. But note the end result of this: a feminist has withdrawn support for another feminist speaking against male violence, ''because a man told her to.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The followers of TERF not only discriminate against trans folks, they also "believe that all women who have sex with men are at best victims of Stockholm Syndrome and at worse quislings; that bisexual women are particularly reprehensible because they could choose to sleep only with women".&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;As [[Roz Kaveney]] points out in her essay "Woman Enough", TERF activists "reject calls for broad alliances or an intersectional feminism that respects difference" and "acceptance of trans rights can only come at the expense of their own centrality to the female space".&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Criticism ==

During the early years, some radical feminists were criticized for emphasizing sex-based [[discrimination]] at the expense of [[Race (human classification)|race]]- and [[Social class|class]]-based discrimination, for being unwilling to work with men to effect change through political channels, and for reinforcing [[gender essentialism]] (the idea that men and women are inherently different).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yorku.ca/problema/Issues/Problematique0105.pdf | title=Women's Sexuality: On the Socialist Feminist Road to Discovery | first=Margaret | last=Hillyard Little}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the first radical feminists theorized that "other kinds of hierarchy grew out of and were modeled on male supremacy-were in effect specialized forms of male supremacy".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Willis, E. "Radical Feminism and Feminist Radicalism"|journal=Social Text: The 60's without Apology (91-118)|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, "the struggle against male domination had political priority over other forms of politics" because "the liberation of women would mean the liberation of all".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Thompson, Becky. "Multiracial Feminism: Recasting the Chronology Of Second Wave Feminism."|journal=Feminist studies|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this is bogus logic, because it accepts the notion that "men in creating and maintaining these systems are acting purely as men, in accordance with peculiarly male characteristics or specifically male supremacist objectives".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to [[Ellen Willis]]' 1984 essay ''Radical Feminism and Feminist Radicalism'', within the New Left, radical feminists were accused of being "bourgeois", "antileft", or even "apolitical", whereas they saw themselves as further "radicalizing the left by expanding the definition of radical".&lt;ref name="Willis-120"&gt;Willis, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Early radical feminists were "overwhelmingly white and mostly middle class" resulting in "a very fragile kind of solidarity" that "excluded large groups of women".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Early radical feminists tended to be white and middle class. Willis hypothesized that this was, at least in part, because "most black and working-class women could not accept the abstraction of feminist issues from race and class issues";&lt;ref name="Willis-122" /&gt; the resulting narrow demographic base, in turn, limited the validity of generalizations based on radical feminists' personal experiences of gender relations.&lt;ref name="Willis-122" /&gt; However, the rejection of other marginalized groups of women "allowed white middle-class women to minimize the ways in which women participated in and benefited from race and class privilege".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Failure to recognize "social differences among women" negatively affected the movement, "limit[ing] and distort[ing] both [their] analysis and [their] practice".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many early radical feminists broke political ties with "male-dominated left groups",&lt;ref name="Willis-120" /&gt; or would work with them only in ''ad hoc'' coalitions.&lt;ref name="Willis-120" /&gt;

Also, Willis, although very much a part of early radical feminism and continuing to hold that it played a necessary role in placing feminism on the political agenda, later criticized its inability "to integrate a feminist perspective with an overall radical politics,"&lt;ref name="Willis-120" /&gt; while viewing this limitation as inevitable in the historical context of the times.&lt;ref name="Willis-120" /&gt; In part this limitation arose from the fact that consciousness raising, as "the primary method of understanding women's condition"&lt;ref name="Willis-121"&gt;Willis, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; in the movement at this time and its "most successful organizing tool",&lt;ref name="Willis-121" /&gt; led to an emphasis on personal experience that concealed "prior political and philosophical assumptions".&lt;ref name="Willis-121" /&gt; "Although the late 1960's and early 1970's might have been the 'heyday' for white 'radical' feminists in CR groups, from the perspective of white aniracists, the early 1970's were a low point of feminism-a time when many women who were committed to an antiracist analysis had to put their feminism on the back burner in order to work with women and men of color against racism".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
