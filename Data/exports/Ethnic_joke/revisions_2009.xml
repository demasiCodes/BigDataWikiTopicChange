An '''ethnic joke''' is a humorous remark relating to an ethnic, racial or cultural group, often referring to a [[ethnic stereotype|stereotype]] of the group in question for its punchline. 

Ethnic jokes have been around since people first noticed they were different from one another, and ethnocentrism and a sense of ethnic identity appeared. Jokes feed upon difference and distinctions (not only ethnic, of course) and if one of the functions of ethnic jokes is to ridicule and depreciate these in-out groups, another function is to maintain and strengthen a sense of one’s identity in some in-group. 

It may be that ethnic humour helps us deal with hostility verbally instead of physically, but these slurs also reinforce our stereotypes and sometimes lead to calls for violence[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aZkRJJnc6BUC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=Davies,+Christie.+Ethnic+Humor&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=0_0#PPA67,M1]. 

Ethnic jokes are often considered to be offensive and as a form of [[hate speech]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Perceived as such, they may sometimes be referred to as '''race jokes''', or '''racist jokes''' 

Ethnic jokes come and go with [[social change]], particularly with waves of [[immigration]] from one country to another; for example, [[Poland|Polish]] jokes, which are common in the [[United States]]. Similarly, Irish jokes have become far less common in the [[United Kingdom]] as the [[social status]] of Irish people has risen with increased [[wealth]] in Ireland, the consequent reduction in Irish itinerant labour, and the absorption of Irish people into the community. As public awareness of racism has increased, racial and ethnic jokes have become increasingly socially unacceptable in recent years, and have become socially [[taboo]] to tell in public in many regions. This can however, depend on who is telling the joke. For example, it may be deemed offensive for a white person to make a joke about Asians, whereas it would be more acceptable for an Asian to make a similar joke about their own culture. Many comedians from ethnic background do this on a regular basis. 

It is sometimes held that such [[stereotypes]] must contain a grain of truth; research suggests that this is most often not the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9598717/|title=Science gets the last laugh on ethnic jokes|publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is claimed by some that ethnic jokes have a basis in fact,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1972565.stm|title=Why do people find racist jokes funny?|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2002-05-07|accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some ethnic jokes deliberately try to prove their point, for instance:

==Racial targets==
[[Ethnicity|Ethnic]] jokes are often aimed at [[minorities]] within certain regions, or peoples from neighbouring areas. A common ethnic joke format is the "stupid person" joke, where the [[stock character]], who is the butt of the joke, belongs to an ethnic group singled out for abuse. Such jokes are often interchangeable, with the [[social stigma|stigma]]tized group varying from region to region (e.g. the English tell such jokes about the Irish, [[Canada|Canadians]] about people from the province of Newfoundland, or "[[Newfie]]"s). In other ethnic jokes, the targeted ethnic group is one that has historically been associated with the privileged ruling class, as in the "Jan van der Merwe" jokes of [[South Africa]], which make fun of [[Afrikaner]]s (Jan van der Merwe being a stereotypical Dutch name). People with different [[skin colour]] may be singled out for offensive jokes, with [[Black people]] being an example of a common target in certain countries. People of [[India]]n, [[Pakistan]]i and [[Bangladesh]]i descent, who are a substantial [[minority group]] in England, are the target of similar jokes. [[Jews]] (and sometimes [[Poles]] as well) are also a common target of ethnic jokes within Europe and North America.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}. 

When talking about ethnic humour, distinctions are sometimes made as to whether the humour comes from the inside or the outside, the idea being that when self-mocking humour comes from the inside, it pushes out the boundaries of acceptable or expected behaviours by making fun of one or more of the group characteristics known to the insider. Complimentary humour coming from the inside works to increase group pride and satisfaction. In contrast, jokes coming from the outside are more likely to be critical or insulting. And even if they are no more critical than insider jokes, they are viewed more negatively, as their effect is to tighten the boundaries or freeze the stereotypes because the outsider is not in a position to bring about group change. What these distinctions ignore is that insult humour is only one kind of joking - ([http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-5991337/Just-how-ethnic-is-ethnic.html Just how ethnic is ethnic humour?]).

Most of the researchers like Davies and Leon Rappoport have argued that ethnic jokes do not propagate ethnic stereotypes, but are often a way of positive interaction between communities.

==The Theory of Ethnic Humour==

The predominant and most widely known theory of ethnic humour attempts to discover societal regularities in the anecdote
traditions of different countries by contextually describing jokes. Professor Christie Davies, author of this theory, has posed the main arguments in his article Ethnic Jokes, Moral Values and Social Boundaries, published in 1982. His approach is based on Raskin’s (1985) Semantic Script Theory of Humour (SSTH), or to be more precise, on the arguments connected with ethnic humour on binary oppositions. While Raskin merely described the main binary oppositions providing examples mostly from the Jew humour), Davies explores the situations where the scripts apply - for example,he has discovered that the most common opposition stupid - clever is applied under particular circumstances in the social reality of two ethnic groups concerned.

Links have been established between the scripts of the jokes and social facts, such as, for example, modern society’s hesitance in regarding people’s primary actions such as working, eating and drinking, sexual life and warfare. Issues related to these actions are present in more or less all societies; the societies where these are absent also lack the corresponding jokes (e.g. jokes about alcohol are missing in Muslim and Jewish jokelore) [http://www.folklore.ee/folklore]. The anecdote
tradition of each individual culture are based on the presupposition that the joke centres on divergence from the norm
and average.

Davies in his monograph published in 1990 has surmised that ''Jokes in every country (or reasonably homogenous cultural and linguistic domain) have certain targets for stupidity jokes - people who dwell on the edge of that nation or domain and who are perceived as culturally ambiguous by the dominant people of the centre. In addition, they will likely be rustic people or immigrants in search of unskilled and low-prestige manual work. They are to a great extent similar to the joke-tellers themselves, share the same cultural background or even speak a similar or identical language''. According to Davies, Ethnic jokes are centred around three main themes of Stupidity, Canniness and Sexual Behaviour

'''Stupidity''' - Jokes in every country (or reasonably homogenous cultural and linguistic domain) have certain targets for stupidity jokes - people who dwell on the edge of that nation or domain and who are perceived as culturally ambiguous by the dominant people of the centre. In addition, they will likely be rustic people or immigrants in search of unskilled and low-prestige manual work. They are to a great extent similar to the joke-tellers themselves, share the same cultural background or even speak a similar or identical language.

'''Canniness''' - As the counterpart of stupidity jokes, there exist jokes about canniness that usually depict unambiguous, well-integrated and economically successful group of people, either only locally known (e.g. the population of the Laihia (Laihela) village in Finland) or international (e.g. the Jews or Japanese). 

'''Sexual behaviour''' - There are also more culture-specific jokes about ludicrous behaviour concerning militarism, alcohol consumption, sexual behaviour,etc. These jokes are based on the cultural background of the object of ridicule and the teller of the joke, and their mutual attitude towards the problems with the areas mentioned.
