The '''National Organization for Women''' ('''NOW''') is a [[Feminism|feminist]] organization founded in 1966. It has a membership of 550,000. The organization consists of 550 chapters in all 50 U.S. states and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.now.org/organization/info.html Information about NOW.]" National Organization for Women. Retrieved 2011-01-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
NOW was founded on June 30, 1966, in [[Washington, D.C.]], by 28 people attending the Third National Conference of State Commissions on the Status of Women, the successor to the [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pauli Murray: The Autobiography of a Black Activist |last=Murray |first=Pauli|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Statement of Purpose declares that "the time has come to confront, with concrete action, the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying the equality of opportunity and freedom of choice which is their right, as individual Americans, and as human beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Organization for Women (NOW)|url=http://wax.lib.harvard.edu/collections/seed.do?seed=1498&amp;primColl=261&amp;lang=eng|publisher=Harvard University Library Web Archive Collection Service|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founders included [[Betty Friedan]] (the author of ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' (1963), who was also NOW's first president), Rev. [[Pauli Murray]], the first African-American female Episcopal priest, and [[Shirley Chisholm]], the first Black woman to run for President of the United States of America. [[Betty Friedan]] and [[Pauli Murray]] wrote NOW's Statement of Purpose&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.now.org/history/purpos66.html |title=The National Organization for Women's 1966 Statement of Purpose |publisher=National Organization for Women |accessdate=2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1966; the original was scribbled on a napkin by Friedan.

There were many influences contributing to the rise of NOW. Such influences included the President's Commission on the Status of Women, Betty Friedan's book ''The Feminine Mystique'', and passage and lack of enforcement of the [[Civil Right Act of 1964]] (prohibiting sexual discrimination).&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Jone Johnson|title=National Organization for Women - NOW|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/feminism/p/now.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The President's Commission on the Status of Women was established in 1961 by [[John F. Kennedy]], in hopes of providing a solution to female discrimination in education, work force, and Social Security. Kennedy appointed [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] as the Head of the organization. The goal of action was to compromise those wanting to advance women's rights in work force (such as advocates of [[Equal Rights Amendment]]) and those advocating women's domestic importance/role needing to be preserved (such as organized labor groups). The commission was in a way to settle the tension between opposing sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Jone Johnson|title=President's Commission on the Status of Women|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/laws/a/status_women.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Betty Friedan wrote ''The Feminine Mystique'' in response to her own experiences. She was a feminist long before her book, by educating herself and deviating from the domestic female paradigm. The book's purpose was to fuel movement to a women's role outside of domestic environment. Acknowledging some satisfaction from raising kids, cooking, rearranging house decor was not enough to suffice the deeper desire for women to achieve an education.&lt;ref name="Friedan interview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wattenberg|first=Ben|title=Betty Friedan Interview|url=http://www.pbs.org/fmc/interviews/friedan.htm|work=The First Measured Century|publisher=PBS|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Friedan specifically notes, 

“there was no activism in that cause when I wrote ''Feminine Mystique''. But I realized that it was not enough just to write a book. There had to be social change. And I remember somewhere in that period coming off an airplane [and] some guy was carrying a sign... It said, "The first step in revolution is consciousness." Well, I did the consciousness with The Feminine Mystique. But then there had to be organization and there had to be a movement. And I helped organize NOW, the National Organization for Women and the National Women's Political Caucus and NARAL, the abortion rights [organization] in the next few years.”&lt;ref name="Friedan interview"/&gt;

Even for the feminist activist, her book signified a moment in history that was enough to galvanize action toward an official organization." 

In 1968 NOW issued a Bill of Rights which they had adopted at their 1967 national conference, which advocated the passage of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], enforcement of the prohibitions against sex discrimination in employment under [[Title VII]] of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, [[maternity leave]] rights in employment and in Social Security benefits, tax deduction for home and child care expenses for working parents, child day care centers, equal and non-[[Single-sex education|gender-segregated education]], equal job training opportunities and allowances for women in poverty, and the right of women to control their reproductive lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~hst306/documents/nowrights.html |title=N.O.W. Bill of Rights, 1968 |publisher=National Organization for Women |accessdate=2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 [[Ivy Bottini]] designed the logo for NOW which is still their logo today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gendered Lives: Communication, Gender and Culture |last=Wood |first=Julia T. |year=2005 |edition=6th |publisher=Wadsworth/Thompson Learning |location=Belmont, California |isbn=0-534-63615-2 |pages=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocation of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] was a pertinent issue to NOW. The amendment had three primary objectives, which were: 

“Section 1. Equality of Rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of sex.
Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.
Section 3. This amendment shall take effect two years after the date of ratification.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equal Rights Amendment|url=http://www.now.org/issues/economic/eratext.html|publisher=National Organization for Women|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts were proven successful when Congress passed the amendment in 1972. However, simply passing the amendment in the two houses of Congress did not mean the work was finished. NOW had to direct the efforts of getting the amendment ratified in at least three-fourths of the states (38 out of the 50 states).&lt;ref name="about1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Napikoski|first=Linda|title=Equal Rights Amendment: Constitutional Equality and Justice for All?|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/equalrightsamendment/a/equal_rights_amendment_overview.htm|accessdate=29 October 2013|publisher=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to opposing states denying the ratification of the amendment, NOW encouraged members to participate in marches and economic boycotts. “Dozens of organizations supported the ERA and the boycott, including the [[League of Women Voters]], the [[YWCA]] of the U.S., the Unitarian Universalist Association, the [[United Auto Workers]] (UAW), the [[National Education Association]] (NEA), and the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC).”&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt;

As strong as the support was, it was to no avail to the opposition from various groups. These groups included select religious collectives, business/ insurance interests, and most visibly was the Stop-ERA campaign led by antifeminist [[Phyllis Schlafly]]. Schalfy argued on the premise of creating equality in work force or anywhere else would hinder the laws that are instilled for the mere protection of these women. The safety of women was a higher priority than ensuring there is equality in financial and social scenarios. Interestingly enough, the predicament over the Equal Rights Amendment was not a fight between men and women who abhor men, but rather two groups of women advocating different perspectives on the nature of their lives. The rivalry was sparked in speeches, such as that of Schlafly who began her dialogue by thanking her husband for allowing her to participate in such an activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=57c. The Equal Rights Amendment|url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/57c.asp|publisher=Ushistory.org|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though efforts did not prove to be enough to have the amendment ratified, the organization remains active in lobbying legislatures and media outlets on feminist issues.

Abortion being an individual woman's choice has come into the forefront since the Supreme Court case of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' in 1973. The decision of the court was that it ultimately was the woman's choice in reproduction. However according to National Organization for Women, decisions following the 1973 landmark case had substantially limited this right, which culminated their response to encourage the [[Freedom of Choice Act]]. The controversy over the landmark case ruling was initiated in the two cases, ''[[Gonzales v. Planned Parenthood]]'' and ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]''. These two cases consequently banned abortion methods after 12 weeks of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="prochoiceamerica1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom of Choice Acts|url=http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/what-is-choice/fast-facts/foca.html|publisher=NARAL Pro-Choice America|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gonzalez v. Planned Parenthood'' and ''Gonzalez v. Carhart'' both dealt with the question of whether the 2003 [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] was unconstitutional by violating the [[Due Process Clause]] of the Fifth Amendment expressed in the ''Roe v. Wade'' case. This act ultimately meant that the “concept of partial-birth abortion as defined in the Act as any abortion in which the death of the fetus occurs when "the entire fetal head [...] or [...] any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother” is banned. The Supreme Court ultimately decided 5-4 that it was not unconstitutional and did not hinder a woman's right to an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gonzales v. Planned Parenthood|url=http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2006/2006_05_1382|publisher=The Oyez Project|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National Organization for Women claimed it was a disregard to a basic principle stemming from ''Roe v. Wade'', which was to only have legislative restriction on abortion be justified with the intention of protecting women's health. Hence, the support for the Freedom of Choice Act (FOCA) which primary purpose was to safeguard a woman's access to abortions even if the ''Roe v. Wade'' ruling is further disregarded. As of 2013, there are seven states that have made the Freedom of Choice Act state law. FOCA will consequently supersede any other law prohibiting abortion. They are: California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Nevada, Wisconsin, Maine, and Washington.  In addition, Maryland, Nevada, and Washington were the only three states to adhere via ballet initiative.&lt;ref name="prochoiceamerica1"/&gt;

Succeeding in the enactment of FOCA would ultimately mean fulfilment of three goals for the National Organization for Women. First, asserting a woman's reproductive right. Second, disseminate information to the public audience about threats posed in the two court cases mentioned above. Third, through the dissemination of information to the public, this in return would mobilize efforts to support female rights in multiple areas that will be presented in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom of Choice Act would Guarantee Roe Protections in U.S. Statutes|url=http://www.now.org/issues/abortion/070430foca.html|publisher=National Organization for Women|date=April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
[[Betty Friedan]] and [[Pauli Murray]] wrote the organization's Statement of Purpose&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; in 1966. The statement described the purpose of NOW as "To take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men." The six core issues that NOW addresses are abortion and reproductive health services access, violence against women, constitutional equality, promoting diversity/ending racism, lesbian rights, and economic justice, with these issues having various sub-issues. The organization goes about creating these changes through laborious lobbying, rallies, marches, and conferences. NOW focuses on a variety of issues deploying multiple strategies, causing it to be an organization in which a comprehensive goal is envisaged and performed.  
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key Issues |url=http://www.now.org/issues/ |publisher=National Organization for Women |accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Priorities mentioned above were pursued to ultimately secure constitutional amendments guaranteeing these rights. Through litigation, political pressure, and physical marches, NOW members held an authoritative stance leading to recognition in court cases, such as ''[[National Organization for Women v. Scheidler|NOW v. Scheidler]]'' and ''Weeks v. Southern Bell''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tripp|first=Jennifer|title=National Organization for Women|url=http://learningtogive.org/papers/paper200.html|accessdate=29 October 2013|publisher=Grand Valley State University|work=Learning To Give}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''NOW v. Scheidler'' revolved around the issue of racketeering to gain support for anti-abortion groups. NOW was suing the groups for utilization of violence and the threat of violence for garnering support. The violence varied from physical barriers into entrances of abortion clinic to arson and bombings of those clinics. The plaintiff accused the Pro-Life Action Network (PLAN) for unethical seizing the right of women to make decisions about their own bodies, and that this right needed to be defended. The case was a success in terms of the class action suit “brought against terrorists by those they had terrorized”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heinonline.org/HOL/LuceneSearch?terms=%2262%20Alb.%20L.%20Rev.%20%20967%22&amp;collection=journals&amp;searchtype=advanced&amp;submit=Go&amp;sections=any&amp;sections=external&amp;other_cols=yes&amp;cited_by=true&amp;sortby=cited_by 62 Alb. L. Rev. 967 (1998-1999) NOW v. Scheidler: Protecting Women's Access to Reproductive Health Services]; Clayton, Fay; Love, Sara N.&lt;/ref&gt;

However the case was dismissed based on the mere definition of racketeering because racketeering must have an economic inclination, and there was no evidence to prove PLAN had this financial intention. This does not mean it was not a significant case. It brought light and recognition to National Organization for Women and its goals. If anything, it galvanized the organization to strengthen its tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Oyez Project: [http://learningtogive.org/papers/paper200.html NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR WOMEN (NOW) v. SCHEIDLER]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Weeks v. Southern Bell'' had the same effect, but this is an example where those galvanized efforts proved beneficial. This concerned discriminatory practices against women in the workplace. [[Lorena Weeks]], employee of Southern Bell, claimed she was being discriminated against via exclusion to higher paying positions within the company. Sylvia Roberts acted as her attorney, supporting Week's grievances with the accusation of the company's violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (1964). Title VII is enabled to "protect individuals against employment discrimination on the bases of race and color, as well as national origin, sex, and religion". With this premise, Weeks, with the aid of Sylvia Roberts, succeeded in 1969 after making an appeal. The trial not only served as the triumph of National Organization of Women, but brought to life legislation made to the intentions of organizations, such as NOW.&lt;ref&gt; [http://russelldoc.galib.uga.edu/russell/view?docId=ead/RBRL263LWSB-ead.xml;query=;brand=default Lorena Weeks Files related to Weeks v.

==Criticism==
NOW has been criticized by various [[pro-life]], [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], and [[fathers' rights movement|fathers' rights]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pncqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BVkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4576,2703172|title=NOW Seeking Abortion Summit|last=Cimons|first=Marlene|date=8 February 1979|work=The Pittsburgh Press|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=23wkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=idsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1850,6833582&amp;dq=national-organization-for-women+father%27s+rights&amp;hl=en|title=Women wary of man's bid to crash panel|last=Susman|first=Carolyn|date=30 July 1986|work=The Palm Beach Post|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=e6VOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OvsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3552,2671261&amp;dq=national-organization-for-women+conservatives&amp;hl=en|title=Conservatives urge Reagan to deny 'leftists' grants|date=8 April 1982|work=Lakeland Ledger|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s, NOW was criticized{{Who|date=September 2009}} for having a double standard when it refused to support women who made accusations of sexual misconduct (sexual harassment charged by [[Paula Jones]] and [[Kathleen Willey]] and rape charged by [[Juanita Broaddrick]]) against former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] President [[Bill Clinton]] while calling for the resignation of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politician ([[Bob Packwood]]) who was accused of similar offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/23/news/mn-42260|title=NOW Won't Back Paula Jones, Cites Her Backers|last=Jackson|first=Robert|date=23 April 1998|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NOW has also been criticized by feminists who claim it is too inclusive{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}, and focuses on liberal policy issues rather than women's rights.  NOW has been criticized for not supporting pro-life feminists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2008/11/10/feminists-can-be-pro-life/|title=Feminists can be pro-life|last=Seager|first=Ilana|date=10 November 2008|publisher=Yale Daily News|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/meet-the-bold-new-feminists/|title=Meet the Bold ‘New Feminists'|last=Browder|first=Sue Ellen|date=1 August 2013|publisher=National Catholic Register|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other liberal issues, and support the Iraq War.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Some members, such as LA NOW chapter president [[Tammy Bruce]] left NOW, saying they oppose putting liberal and partisan policy positions over equality for all women.

Additionally, Deborah Watkins, who was once the President of the Dallas Chapter of NOW, left NOW in 2003 to found, in the same year, the Dallas-Fort Worth Chapter of the [[National Coalition for Men]], stating she grew tired of what she considered "hypocrisy" and "male bashing" at NOW.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncfm.org/?page_id=138 History of the National Coalition for Men] "Both the Los Angeles, California and Dallas/Ft.
