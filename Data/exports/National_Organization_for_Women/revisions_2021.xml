The '''National Organization for Women''' ('''NOW''') is an American [[feminist]] organization founded in 1966. The organization consists of 550 chapters in all 50 [[U.S. state]]s and in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.now.org/organization/info.html Information about NOW.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112062509/http://www.now.org/organization/info.html |date=2011-01-12 }}" National Organization for Women.

==History==

=== Background ===
There were many influences contributing to the rise of NOW. Such influences included the President's Commission on the Status of Women, [[Betty Friedan]]'s 1963 book ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', and the passage and lack of enforcement of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] (prohibiting sexual discrimination).&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/feminism/p/now.htm|title=National Organization for Women – NOW|last=Lewis|first=Jone Johnson|publisher=About.com|access-date=29 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511165858/http://womenshistory.about.com/od/feminism/p/now.htm|archive-date=2013-05-11|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The President's Commission on the Status of Women was established in 1961 by [[John F. Kennedy]], in hopes of providing a solution to female discrimination in education, work force, and Social Security. Kennedy appointed [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] as the head of the organization. The goal of action was to reconcile those wanting to advance women's rights in the workforce (such as advocates of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]]) and those advocating women's domestic role needing to be preserved (such as organized labor groups). The commission was a way to settle the tension between opposing sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/laws/a/status_women.htm|title=President's Commission on the Status of Women|last=Lewis|first=Jone Johnson|publisher=About.com|access-date=29 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329084227/http://womenshistory.about.com/od/laws/a/status_women.htm|archive-date=2014-03-29|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Betty Friedan wrote ''The Feminine Mystique'' in response to her own experiences. She was a feminist long before her book, by educating herself and deviating from the domestic female paradigm. The book's purpose was to fuel movement to a women's role outside of domestic environment. Acknowledging some satisfaction from raising children, cooking, and rearranging house decor was not enough to suffice the deeper desire for women to achieve an education.&lt;ref name="Friedan interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/fmc/interviews/friedan.htm|title=Betty Friedan Interview|last=Wattenberg|first=Ben|work=The First Measured Century|publisher=PBS|access-date=29 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924120434/http://www.pbs.org/fmc/interviews/friedan.htm|archive-date=2013-09-24|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is widely credited with sparking the beginning of [[second-wave feminism]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/us/betty-friedan-who-ignited-cause-in-feminine-mystique-dies-at-85.html|title=Betty Friedan, Who Ignited Cause in 'Feminine Mystique,' Dies at 85|first=Margalit|last=Fox|date=5 February 2006|access-date=19 February 2017|newspaper=The New York Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201200010/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/us/betty-friedan-who-ignited-cause-in-feminine-mystique-dies-at-85.html|archive-date=2017-02-01|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published on February 19, 1963, by [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company|W. W. Norton]]. In an interview, Friedan specifically notes,&lt;ref name="Friedan interview" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;There was no activism in that cause when I wrote ''Feminine Mystique''. But I realized that it was not enough just to write a book. There had to be social change. And I remember somewhere in that period coming off an airplane [and] some guy was carrying a sign... It said, "The first step in revolution is consciousness." Well, I did the consciousness with ''The Feminine Mystique''. But then there had to be organization and there had to be a movement. And I helped organize NOW, the National Organization for Women and the [[National Women's Political Caucus]] and [[NARAL]], the abortion rights [organization] in the next few years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Founding ===
The National Organization for Women (NOW) was founded in 1966 by 28 women at the Third National Conference of Commissions on the Status of Women in June (the successor to the [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women]]), and another 21 women and men who became founders at the October 1966 NOW Organizing Conference, for a total of 49 founders.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web |first=Allyson |last=Goldsmith |url=http://now.org/about/history/honoring-our-founders-pioneers/ |title=Honoring Our Founders and Pioneers |publisher=National Organization for Women |date=2014-02-09 |access-date=2015-05-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425005046/http://now.org/about/history/honoring-our-founders-pioneers/ |archive-date=2015-04-25 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both conferences were held in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; The 28 women who became founders in June were: Ada Allness, Mary Evelyn Benbow, Gene Boyer, [[Shirley Chisholm]], Analoyce Clapp, [[Kathryn F. Clarenbach]], Catherine Conroy, Caroline Davis, [[Mary Eastwood]], Edith Finlayson, [[Betty Friedan]], Dorothy Haener, Anna Roosevelt Halstead, Lorene Harrington, [[Aileen Hernandez]], Mary Lou Hill, Esther Johnson, Nancy Knaak, Min Matheson, Helen Moreland, [[Pauli Murray]], Ruth Murray, Inka O'Hanrahan, Pauline A. Parish, Eve Purvis, Edna Schwartz, Mary-Jane Ryan Snyder, Gretchen Squires, Betty Talkington and Caroline Ware.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

They were inspired by the failure of the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] to enforce [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]]; at the Third National Conference of State Commissions on the Status of Women they were prohibited from issuing a resolution that recommended the EEOC carry out its legal mandate to end sex discrimination in employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.feminist.org/research/chronicles/fc1966.html |title=The Feminist Chronicles, 1953–1993 – 1966 – Feminist Majority Foundation |publisher=Feminist.org |access-date=2015-05-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527025013/http://feminist.org/research/chronicles/fc1966.html |archive-date=2015-05-27 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="makers1"&gt;{{cite web |author=MAKERS Team |url=http://www.makers.com/blog/nows-47th-anniversary-celebrating-its-founders-and-early-members |title=NOW's 47th Anniversary: Celebrating Its Founders and Early Members |publisher=MAKERS |date=2013-06-30 |access-date=2015-05-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518073400/http://www.makers.com/blog/nows-47th-anniversary-celebrating-its-founders-and-early-members |archive-date=2015-05-18 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; They thus gathered in Betty Friedan's hotel room to form a new organization.&lt;ref name="makers1"/&gt; On a paper napkin Friedan scribbled the acronym "NOW".&lt;ref name="makers1"/&gt; The 21 people who became founders in October were: Caruthers Berger, Colleen Boland, Inez Casiano, [[Carl Degler]], Elizabeth Drews, [[Mary Esther Gaulden Jagger|Mary Esther Gaulden]] (later Jagger), [[Muriel Fox]], Ruth Gober, Richard Graham, [[Anna Arnold Hedgeman]], Lucille Kapplinger (later Hazell), [[Bessie Margolin]], Margorie Palmer, [[Sonia Pressman Fuentes|Sonia Pressman]] (later Fuentes), [[Sister Mary Joel Read]], Amy Robinson, Charlotte Roe, [[Alice Rossi]], Claire R. Salmond, Morag Simchak and Clara Wells.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

The founders were frustrated with the way in which the federal government was not enforcing the new anti-discrimination laws. Even after measures like the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, employers were still discriminating against women in terms of hiring women and unequal pay with men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Feminism in Our Time: The Essential Writings, World War II to the Present|last = Schneir|first = Miriam|publisher = Vintage Books|year = 1994|pages = 95–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's rights advocates saw that these legal changes were not being enforced and worried that without a feminist pressure group, a type of "[[NAACP]] for women",&lt;ref name="Schneir 1994 95"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Feminism in Our Time: The Essential Writings, World War II to the Present|last = Schneir|first = Miriam|publisher = Vintage Books|year = 1994|page = 95}}&lt;/ref&gt; women would not be able to combat discrimination. NOW was created in order to mobilize women, give women's rights advocates the power to put pressure on employers and the government, and to promote full equality of the sexes. It hoped to increase the number of women attending colleges and graduate schools, employed in professional jobs instead of domestic or secretarial work, and appointed to federal offices.&lt;ref name="Schneir 1994 98"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Feminism in Our Time: The Essential Writings, World War II to the Present|last = Schneir|first = Miriam|publisher = Vintage Books|year = 1994|page = 98}}&lt;/ref&gt; NOW's Statement of Purpose,&lt;ref name="msu.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~hst306/documents/nowstate.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-11-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150117134328/http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~hst306/documents/nowstate.html |archive-date=2015-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was adopted at its organizing conference in Washington, D.C., on October 29, 1966, declares among other things that "the time has come to confront, with concrete action, the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying the equality of opportunity and freedom of choice which is their right, as individual Americans, and as human beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Organization for Women (NOW)|url=http://wax.lib.harvard.edu/collections/seed.do?seed=1498&amp;primColl=261&amp;lang=eng|publisher=Harvard University Library Web Archive Collection Service|access-date=29 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019172936/http://wax.lib.harvard.edu/collections/seed.do?seed=1498&amp;primColl=261&amp;lang=eng|archive-date=2013-10-19|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; NOW was also one of the first women's organizations to include the concerns of black women in their efforts.&lt;ref name="Schneir 1994 98"/&gt;

=== Lesbian rights ===
In 1969, [[Ivy Bottini]], who was openly lesbian, designed the logo for NOW, which is still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gendered Lives: Communication, Gender and Culture |last=Wood |first=Julia T. |year=2005 |edition=6th |publisher=Wadsworth/Thompson Learning |location=Belmont, California |isbn=0-534-63615-2 |pages=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first time lesbian concerns were introduced into NOW also occurred in 1969, when Bottini, who was then president of the New York chapter of NOW, held a public forum titled "Is Lesbianism a Feminist Issue?".&lt;ref name="bare_url_d"&gt;[[Barbara Love|Love, Barbara J.]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=kpNarH7t9CkC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=1968+lesbian+ivy+bottini&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4P7QT4ToGcXZ0QHIpdDqDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CFoQ6wEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=1968%20lesbian%20ivy%20bottini&amp;f=false Feminists Who Changed America, 1963–1975]&lt;/ref&gt; However, NOW president [[Betty Friedan]] was against lesbian participation in the movement. In 1969, she referred to growing lesbian visibility as a "lavender menace" and fired openly lesbian newsletter editor [[Rita Mae Brown]], and in 1970 she engineered the expulsion of lesbians, including Bottini, from NOW's New York chapter.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Zimmerman [https://books.google.com/books?id=0EUoCrFolGcC&amp;pg=PA134 Lesbian histories and cultures: an encyclopedia], Garland Pub., 2000 {{ISBN|0815319207}} p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vicki Lynn Eaklor [https://books.google.com/books?id=qJZdHuZ0aM0C&amp;pg=PA145 Queer America: a GLBT history of the 20th century], ABC-CLIO, 2008 {{ISBN|0313337497}} p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction, at the 1970 Congress to Unite Women, on the first evening when all four hundred feminists were assembled in the auditorium, twenty women wearing T-shirts that read "Lavender Menace" came to the front of the room and faced the audience.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;Flora Davis [https://books.google.com/books?id=ioM-8naFn60C&amp;pg=PA264 Moving the mountain: the women's movement in America since 1960], University of Illinois Press, 1999 {{ISBN|0-252-06782-7}} p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; One of the women then read their group's paper "[[The Woman-Identified Woman]]", which was the first major lesbian feminist statement.&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheshire Calhoun [https://books.google.com/books?id=7V73W75tGssC&amp;pg=PA27 Feminism, the Family, and the Politics of the Closet: Lesbian and Gay Displacement], Oxford University Press, 2003 {{ISBN|0-19-925766-3}} p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The group, who later named themselves "Radicalesbians", were among the first to challenge the heterosexism of heterosexual feminists and to describe lesbian experience in positive terms.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Zerbe Enns [https://books.google.com/books?id=bIe7ZtOubc8C&amp;pg=PA105 Feminist theories and feminist psychotherapies: origins, themes, and diversity], Routledge, 2004 {{ISBN|078901808X}} p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, NOW passed a resolution declaring "that a woman's right to her own person includes the right to define and express her own sexuality and to choose her own lifestyle", as well as a conference resolution stating that forcing lesbian mothers to stay in marriages or to live a secret existence in an effort to keep their children was unjust.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://now.org/resource/now-leading-the-fight/ Leading the Fight | National Organization for Women] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029080637/http://now.org/resource/now-leading-the-fight/ |date=2014-10-29 }}. NOW. Retrieved on 2014-07-25.&lt;/ref&gt; That year, NOW also committed to offering legal and moral support in a test case involving child custody rights of lesbian mothers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; In 1973, the NOW Task Force on Sexuality and Lesbianism was established.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Del Martin was the first open lesbian elected to NOW, and [[Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon]] were the first lesbian couple to join NOW.&lt;ref name="ABOUTMARTIN"&gt;{{cite news |last=Belge |first=Kathy |url=http://lesbianlife.about.com/cs/herstory/p/DelMartin.htm |title=Del Martin |publisher=About |access-date=2007-02-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213073920/http://lesbianlife.about.com/cs/herstory/p/DelMartin.htm |archive-date=2007-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Activism ===

==== Anti-discrimination ====
NOW also helped women get equal access to public places. For example, the [[Oak Room (Plaza Hotel)|Oak Room]] held men-only lunches on weekdays until 1969, when Friedan and other members of NOW staged a protest.&lt;ref name=Times2&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/16/opinion/opinionspecial/16gathje.html |title=What Would Eloise Say? |first=Curtis |last=Gathje |date=January 16, 2005 |work=New York Times |access-date=January 8, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109023014/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/16/opinion/opinionspecial/16gathje.html |archive-date=2015-01-09 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, women were not allowed in [[McSorley's Old Ale House]]'s until August 10, 1970, after NOW attorneys [[Faith Seidenberg]] and [[Karen DeCrow]] filed a discrimination case against the bar in District Court and won.&lt;ref&gt;''Seidenberg v. McSorleys' Old Ale House''&lt;/ref&gt; The two entered McSorley's in 1969 and were refused service, which was the basis for their lawsuit for discrimination.

[[Carole De Saram]], who joined NOW in 1970 and was later president of the New York chapter, led a demonstration in 1972 to protest discriminatory banking policies.

==== Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) ====
Advocacy of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] was also an important issue to NOW. The amendment had three primary objectives, which were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equal Rights Amendment|url=http://www.now.org/issues/economic/eratext.html|publisher=National Organization for Women|access-date=29 October 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008003552/http://www.now.org/issues/economic/eratext.html|archive-date=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Section 1. Equality of Rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of sex.

Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.

Section 3. This amendment shall take effect two years after the date of ratification.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Efforts were proven successful when Congress passed the amendment in 1972. However, simply passing the amendment in the two houses of Congress did not mean the work was finished. NOW had to direct the efforts of getting the amendment ratified in at least three-fourths of the states (38 out of the 50 states).&lt;ref name="about1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Napikoski|first=Linda|title=Equal Rights Amendment: Constitutional Equality and Justice for All?|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/equalrightsamendment/a/equal_rights_amendment_overview.htm|access-date=29 October 2013|publisher=About.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104182017/http://womenshistory.about.com/od/equalrightsamendment/a/equal_rights_amendment_overview.htm|archive-date=2013-11-04|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to opposing states denying the ratification of the amendment, NOW encouraged members to participate in marches and economic boycotts. "Dozens of organizations supported the ERA and the boycott, including the [[League of Women Voters]], the [[YWCA]] of the U.S., the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]], the [[United Auto Workers]] (UAW), the [[National Education Association]] (NEA), and the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC)."&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt;

As strong as the support was, it was to no avail to the opposition from various groups. These groups included select religious collectives, business and insurance interests, and most visibly was the STOP-ERA campaign led by antifeminist [[Phyllis Schlafly]]. Schlafly argued on the premise that creating equality in the work force or anywhere else would hinder the laws that are instilled for the mere protection of these women. The safety of women was a higher priority than ensuring there is equality in financial and social scenarios. The predicament over the Equal Rights Amendment was not a fight between men and women who abhor men, but rather two groups of women advocating different perspectives on the nature of their lives. The rivalry was sparked in speeches, such as that of Schlafly who began her dialogue by thanking her husband for allowing her to participate in such an activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=57c. The Equal Rights Amendment |url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/57c.asp |publisher=Ushistory.org |access-date=29 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910050803/http://www.ushistory.org/us/57c.asp |archive-date=10 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the efforts did not prove to be enough to have the amendment ratified, the organization remains active in lobbying legislatures and media outlets on feminist issues.

==== Abortion ====
Abortion being an individual woman's choice has come into the forefront since the Supreme Court case of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' in 1973. The decision of the court was that it ultimately was the woman's choice in reproduction. However, according to the National Organization for Women, decisions following the 1973 landmark case had substantially limited this right, which culminated in their response to encourage the [[Freedom of Choice Act]]. The controversy over the landmark case ruling was initiated in the two cases, ''[[Gonzales v. Planned Parenthood]]'' and ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]''. These two cases consequently banned abortion methods after 12 weeks of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="prochoiceamerica1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom of Choice Acts|url=http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/what-is-choice/fast-facts/foca.html|publisher=NARAL Pro-Choice America|access-date=29 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021214925/http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/what-is-choice/fast-facts/foca.html|archive-date=2013-10-21|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gonzalez v. Planned Parenthood'' and ''Gonzalez v. Carhart'' both dealt with the question of whether the 2003 [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] was unconstitutional for violating the [[Due Process Clause]] of the Fifth Amendment expressed in the ''Roe v. Wade'' case. This act ultimately meant that the concept of partial-birth abortion as defined in the Act as any abortion in which the death of the fetus occurs when "the entire fetal head [...] or [...] any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother" is banned. The Supreme Court ultimately decided 5–4 that it was not unconstitutional and did not hinder a woman's right to an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gonzales v. Planned Parenthood|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2006/2006_05_1382|publisher=The Oyez Project|access-date=29 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021212711/http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2006/2006_05_1382|archive-date=2013-10-21|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National Organization for Women claimed it was a disregard to a basic principle stemming from ''Roe v. Wade'', which was to only have legislative restriction on abortion be justified with the intention of protecting women's health. Hence, the support for the Freedom of Choice Act (FOCA), which primary purpose was to safeguard a woman's access to abortions even if the ''Roe v. Wade'' ruling is further disregarded. As of 2013, there are seven states that have made the Freedom of Choice Act (FOCA) state law. FOCA will consequently supersede any other law prohibiting abortion in those seven states. They are: California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Nevada, Wisconsin, Maine, and Washington. In addition, Maryland, Nevada, and Washington were the only three states to adhere via ballot initiative.&lt;ref name="prochoiceamerica1"/&gt;

Succeeding in the enactment of FOCA would ultimately mean fulfilment of three goals for the National Organization for Women. First, asserting a woman's reproductive right. Second, disseminate information to the public audience about threats posed in the two court cases mentioned above. Third, through the dissemination of information to the public, this in return would mobilize efforts to support female rights in multiple areas that will be presented in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom of Choice Act would Guarantee Roe Protections in U.S. Statutes|url=http://www.now.org/issues/abortion/070430foca.html|publisher=National Organization for Women|date=April 30, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807012823/http://www.now.org/issues/abortion/070430foca.html|archive-date=August 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women's Strike for Equality ===
On August 26, 1970, the 50th anniversary of the ratification of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] which granted women the right to vote, NOW officially sponsored the Women’s Strike for Equality, a nationwide demonstration for women’s rights.

===Trans rights===
NOW supports [[trans rights]] and opposes [[transphobia]]. NOW president [[Terry O'Neill (feminist)|Terry O'Neill]] said the struggle against transphobia is a feminist issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Transphobia Is a Feminist Issue |url=https://now.org/blog/why-transphobia-is-a-feminist-issue/ |publisher=NOW |access-date=24 November 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; NOW has affirmed that "trans women are women, trans girls are girls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NOW Celebrates International Transgender Day of Visibility |url=https://now.org/media-center/press-release/now-celebrates-transgender-day-of-visibility/ |publisher=NOW |access-date=24 November 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a further statement NOW said that "trans women are women. They deserve equal opportunity, health care, a safe community &amp; workplace, and they deserve to play sports. They have a right to have their identity respected without conforming to perceived sex and gender identity standards. We stand with you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/nationalnow/status/1392515410679930881|title= Trans women are women |publisher=[[National Organization for Women]] |access-date=27 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210512162240/https://twitter.com/NationalNOW/status/1392515410679930881 |archive-date=12 May 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
[[Betty Friedan]] and [[Pauli Murray]] wrote the organization's Statement of Purpose&lt;ref name="msu.edu"/&gt; in 1966. The statement described the purpose of NOW as "To take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men." The six core issues that NOW addresses are abortion and reproductive health services access, violence against women, constitutional equality, promoting diversity/ending racism, lesbian rights, and economic justice, with these issues having various sub-issues. The organization goes about creating these changes through laborious lobbying, rallies, marches, and conferences. NOW focuses on a variety of issues deploying multiple strategies, causing it to be an organization in which a comprehensive goal is envisaged and performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Key Issues |url=http://www.now.org/issues/ |publisher=National Organization for Women |access-date=2009-09-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910123838/http://www.now.org/issues/ |archive-date=2009-09-10 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Priorities mentioned above were pursued to ultimately secure constitutional amendments guaranteeing these rights. Even though discrimination on the basis of sex was illegal, the federal government was not taking an active role in enforcing the constitutional amendments and the new policies.&lt;ref name="Schneir 1994 95"/&gt; NOW sought to apply pressure to employers, local governments, and the federal government to uphold anti-discrimination policies. Through litigation, political pressure, and physical marches, NOW members held an authoritative stance leading to recognition in court cases, such as ''[[National Organization for Women v. Scheidler|NOW v. Scheidler]]'' and ''Weeks v. Southern Bell''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tripp|first=Jennifer|title=National Organization for Women|url=http://learningtogive.org/papers/paper200.html|access-date=29 October 2013|publisher=Grand Valley State University|work=Learning To Give|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012004900/http://learningtogive.org/papers/paper200.html|archive-date=2013-10-12|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''NOW v. Scheidler'' revolved around the issue of racketeering to gain support for anti-abortion groups. NOW was suing the groups for utilization of violence and the threat of violence for garnering support. The violence varied from physical barriers into entrances of abortion clinic to arson and bombings of those clinics. The plaintiff accused the Pro-Life Action Network (PLAN) of unethically seizing the right of women to make decisions about their own bodies and argued that this right needed to be defended. The case was a success in terms of the class action suit "brought against terrorists by those they had terrorized".&lt;ref&gt;[http://heinonline.org/HOL/LuceneSearch?terms=%2262%20Alb.%20L.%20Rev.%20%20967%22&amp;collection=journals&amp;searchtype=advanced&amp;submit=Go&amp;sections=any&amp;sections=external&amp;other_cols=yes&amp;cited_by=true&amp;sortby=cited_by 62 Alb.

However the case was dismissed based on the mere definition of racketeering because racketeering must have an economic inclination, and there was no evidence to prove PLAN had this financial intention. This does not mean it was not a significant case. It brought light and recognition to National Organization for Women and its goals. If anything, it galvanized the organization to strengthen its tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Oyez Project: [http://learningtogive.org/papers/paper200.html NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR WOMEN (NOW) v. SCHEIDLER] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012004900/http://learningtogive.org/papers/paper200.html |date=2013-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Weeks v. Southern Bell'' had the same effect, but this is an example where those galvanized efforts proved beneficial. This concerned discriminatory practices against women in the workplace. [[Lorena Weeks]], employee of Southern Bell, claimed she was being discriminated against via exclusion to higher paying positions within the company. Sylvia Roberts acted as her attorney, supporting Week's grievances with the accusation of the company's violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII is enabled to "protect individuals against employment discrimination on the bases of race and color, as well as national origin, sex, and religion". With this premise, Weeks, with the aid of Sylvia Roberts, succeeded in 1969 after making an appeal. The trial not only served as the triumph of National Organization of Women, but brought to life legislation made to the intentions of organizations, such as NOW.&lt;ref&gt;[http://russelldoc.galib.uga.edu/russell/view?docId=ead/RBRL263LWSB-ead.xml;query=;brand=default Lorena Weeks Files related to Weeks v.

Judge Webber Wright later held President Clinton in contempt of court for giving "intentionally false" testimony about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky in the Paula Jones lawsuit, marking the first time that a sitting president has been sanctioned for disobeying a court order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jan/13/clinton.usa1|title=Clinton pays Paula Jones $850,000|date=13 January 1999|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201045516/https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jan/13/clinton.usa1|archive-date=2017-12-01|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
