The '''National Organization for Women''' ('''NOW''') is the largest [[United States|American]] [[feminist]] organization.  It was founded in 1966 and has a membership of 500,000 contributing members and 550 chapters in all 50 U.S. states and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]].

==Background==
NOW was founded on [[June 30]] [[1966]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], by 28 women and men attending the Third National Conference of the Commission on the Status of Women, the successor to the [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women]].  It had been three years since the Commission reported findings of women being discriminated against. However, the 1966 Conference delegates were prohibited by the administration's rules for the conference from even passing resolutions recommending that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforce its legal mandate to end sex discrimination.

The founders included [[Betty Friedan]], the author of ''The Feminine Mystique'' (1963) and Rev. [[Pauli Murray]], the first African-American woman Episcopal priest.  Acting from the liberal tenet that women and men are alike in important respects and, therefore, entitled to equal rights and opportunities, the movement spawned by Friedan's book is embodied in NOW, the National Organization for Women, which works to secure political, professional, and educational equality for women.  Founded in 1966 with Betty Friedan acting as an organizer, NOW is a public voice for equal rights for women.  It has been extremely effective in enacting rhetorical strategies that have brought about concrete changes in laws and policies that enlarge women's opportunities and protect their rights.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, T,J. "Gendered Lives: communication, gender, and culture", page 69-70. Wadsworth Group, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  

During the 1970s NOW promoted the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] to the [[U.S. Constitution]].  After Congress approved the amendment in 1972, it was quickly ratified by 28 states, and its passage seemed assured.  However, a stop ERA campaign, led by Phyllis Schlafly and generously financed by conservative political and business interests, stymied progress of the legislation.  By 1973, of the needed 38 states, 35 had ratified the amendment, but the remaining ones-conservative Southern and Western states-refused to support passage, and the ERA was defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, T,J. "Gendered Lives: communication, gender, and culture", page 84. Wadsworth Group, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization remains active in lobbying legislatures and media outlets on women's issues.

==Statement of purpose==
[[Betty Friedan]] and [[Pauli Murray]] wrote the organization's Statement of Purpose&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.now.org/history/purpos66.html Statement of Purpose]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1966 (the original was scribbled on a napkin by Friedan). The statement described the purpose of NOW as "''to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men''." 

The current membership brochure paraphrases and expands upon the above excerpt to read: "Our purpose is to take action to bring women into full participation in society â€“ sharing equal rights, responsibilities and opportunities with men, while living free from discrimination." This brochure also states: "NOW is one of the few multi-issue progressive organizations in the United States. NOW stands against all oppression, recognizing that [[racism]], [[sexism]] and [[homophobia]] are interrelated, that other forms of oppression such as classism and ableism work together with these three to keep power and privilege concentrated in the hands of a few." (From [http://www.now.org/about.html About NOW].)

Because its membership is open on the basis of agreement with principle and not gender alone, its name is "National Organization for Women" and not "of Women".

==Current issues==
NOW's priority issues concern U.S. domestic policy.  These include advancing [[reproductive choice| reproductive freedoms]], promoting racial and ethnic diversity and ending [[racism]], stopping [[rape]] and [[domestic violence]], ensuring [[economic justice]], winning [[lesbian rights]], and achieving [[Equal Rights Amendment|constitutional equality]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.now.org/issues/ Issues] Now.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global Issues===
According to NOW's bylaws, NOW's focus is on domestic [[United States|American]] issues; however, NOW does some work on other issues of importance to women and children globally. These issues include genocide in Africa. NOW is also a coalition member with other feminist whose mission is global feminism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womensorganizations.org/ National Council of Women's Organizations]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and chapters==
The membership, meeting yearly in conference, is the supreme governing body of NOW. NOW draws its broad grassroots strength from a nationwide network of local chapters, which are chartered by national NOW and which engage in a wide variety of action programs in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.now.org/conference Conference]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.now.org/chapters/ local chapters]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also various state organizations, which serve to develop and provide resources to local chapters, as well as coordinate statewide activities.

The national level of the organization is led by four elected national officers, by the national Board of Directors, and by national issues committees. These national leaders are responsible for implementing policy as formulated by the annual National Conference, for coordinating national actions, and for providing membership services. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.now.org/officers NOW Officers]&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of Presidents of the National Organization for Women|NOW has had ten national presidents]], beginning with Betty Friedan in 1966. [[Kim Gandy]], the currently serving national president, was elected President on its 35th Anniversary, June 30, 2001 and reelected in 2005.

==Alums==
Among past leaders and notables at various organizational levels of NOW are [[Ti-Grace Atkinson]]; [[Ernesta Drinker Ballard]]; [[Rita Mae Brown]]; [[Shirley Chisholm]]; Kay Clarenbach; [[Mary Daly]]; Caroline Davis; [[Karen DeCrow]]; [[Rosemary Dempsey]]; [[Betty Friedan]]; [[Sonia Pressman Fuentes]]; [[Kim Gandy]]; [[Judy Goldsmith]]; [[Wilma Scott Heide]]; [[Aileen Hernandez]]; [[Shere Hite]]; [[Phineas Indritz]]; [[Patricia Ireland]]; [[Florynce Kennedy|Florynce "Flo" Kennedy]]; [[Del Martin|Phyllis Lyon]]; [[Del Martin]]; [[Kate Millett]]; [[Virginia "Ginny" Montes]]; [[Pauli Murray]]; [[Irma Newmark]]; Sylvia Roberts; [[Barbara Seaman]]; [[Eleanor Smeal]]; Jean Witter; and [[Molly Yard]]. Some were [[List of Presidents of the National Organization for Women|Presidents]]; some served in other capacities. In addition, NOW has given awards to women recognizing work outside of NOW and many others, who may be well-known elsewhere, have been members and contributors.

==Third-party explorations==
In [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], at its 1989 convention on [[July 23]], NOW delegates questioned the merits of the [[two-party system]] and broached the idea of forming a [[third political party|third party]]. 

The same convention issued a "[[Declaration of Women's Political Independence]]." An exploratory commission was formed for the possibilities of amending the [[United States Constitution]] to include freedom from [[sexual discrimination]], the right to a decent [[standard of living]], the right to clean air, clean water and [[natural environment|environment]]al protections, and the right to be free from [[violence]]. 

The commission was chaired by former NOW president [[Eleanor Smeal]]. A month earlier, NOW launched a [[Commission for Responsive Democracy]], which included Smeal, [[John Bayard Anderson|John Anderson]], [[Toney Anaya]], [[Barry Commoner]] and [[Dee Barry]].

==ERA and CEA==
In 1995, the National Organization for Women voted to drop the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], "Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex," from their platform. During that same conference NOW wrote their own constitutional amendment which would cover all of NOW's programs of reform, including abortion, lesbian and gay rights, affirmative action, etc. and labeled it the Constitutional Equality Amendment. 

Although NOW has given moral support to attempts to ratify the ERA, they continue to support the CEA as part of their official platform. 

The Constitutional Equality Amendment, which has not been introduced into any session of Congress, reads;

# Women and men shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place and entity subject to its jurisdiction; through this article, the subordination of women to men is abolished;
# All persons shall have equal rights and privileges without discrimination on account of sex, race, sexual orientation, marital status, ethnicity, national origin, color or indigence;
# This article prohibits pregnancy discrimination and guarantees the absolute right of a woman to make her own reproductive decisions including the termination of pregnancy;
# This article prohibits discrimination based upon characteristics unique to or stereotypes about any class protected under this article. This article also prohibits discrimination through the use of any facially neutral criteria which have a disparate impact based on membership in a class protected under this article.
# This article does not preclude any law, program or activity that would remedy the effects of discrimination and that is closely related to achieving such remedial purposes;
# This article shall be interpreted under the highest standard of judicial review;
# The United States and the several states shall guarantee the implementation and enforcement of this article.

|-
|'''1966 (June)'''
|
* National Organization for Women (NOW) is established by a group of women, including [[Betty Friedan]] and [[Pauli Murray]], who meet to discuss alternative action strategies during the Third Annual Conference of Commissions on the Status of Women in Washington, D.C. Friedan famously writes the acronym NOW on a paper napkin.
* NOW holds its founding conference. Betty Friedan is elected president and Kay Clarenbach, chair of the board. [[Aileen Hernandez]] is elected executive vice president in absentia; [[Richard Graham]], vice president; and [[Caroline Davis]], secretary-treasurer. NOW sets up seven Task Forces: Equal Opportunity of Employment; Legal and Political Rights; Education; Women in Poverty; The Family; Image of Women; and Women and Religion . 
* NOW officers and members begin petitioning EEOC for public hearings on its advertising guidelines and pressuring the Commission to enforce its prohibition against sex discrimination. NOW officers and 35 members file a formal petition with the EEOC for hearings to amend regulations on sex-segregated "Help Wanted" ads. 
|-
|'''1967''' 
|
* At its second national conference, NOW adopts passage of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA), the repeal of all abortion laws, and publicly-funded child care among its goals in a "Bill of Rights for Women." NOW is the first national organization to endorse the legalization of abortion. 
* NOW's National Board adopts by-laws providing for the establishment of chapters, and establishing the national conference as the supreme governing body of the organization. 
* In May, the EEOC holds hearings on sex discrimination in employment ads as a result of NOW's 1966 petition. NOW members demonstrate at EEOC field offices across the country in protest of EEOC's failure to end sex-segregated "Help Wanted" advertising. In December, four NYC newspapers, including the New York Times, de-sexigrate their Help Wanted ads. 
|-
|'''1968''' 
|
* NOW chapters around the country demonstrate at facilities that deny admittance or service to women, demanding equal treatment of women in all public accommodations.

Roberts argues in the Fifth Circuit * U.S. Court of Appeals that it was sex discrimination for Lorena Weeks, a secretary, to be restricted from higher-paying employment as a "switchman" because of a 30-pound lifting limit. Weeks entered the courtroom with her typewriter, which she was regularly required to lift and move â€” yes, it weighed more than 30 pounds. The court later rules in Weeks v. Southern Bell that the weight limitation rule for women violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.
