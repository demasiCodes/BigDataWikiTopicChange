'''Lesbophobia''' comprises various forms of prejudice and negativity towards [[lesbian]]s as individuals, as couples, or as a [[Group (sociology)|social group]]. Based on the categories of [[sex differences in humans|sex]], [[sexual orientation]], [[Identity (social science)|identity]], and [[gender]] expression, this negativity encompasses [[prejudice]], [[discrimination]], [[hatred]], and [[abuse]]; with [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and feelings ranging from disdain to [[hostility]]. Lesbophobia is [[misogyny]] that [[Intersectionality|intersects]] with [[homophobia]], and vice versa.

==Terminology==
The first usage of the term ''lesbophobia'' listed in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is in ''The Erotic Life of the American Wife'' (1972), a book by ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' editor Natalie Gittelson.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite OED|lesbophobia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GAH&gt;{{cite book|title=The Great American Housewife: From Helpmate to Wage Earner, 1776-1986|last=Ogden|first=Annegret S.|date=1986|publisher=Greenwood Press|publication-place=[[Westport, Connecticut]]|page=206|isbn=0-313-24752-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some people use only the more general term ''[[homophobia]]'' to describe this sort of prejudice or behavior, others believe that the terms ''[[homosexual]]'' and ''homophobia'' do not adequately reflect the specific concerns of lesbians, because they experience the double discrimination of both homophobia and sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=18 December 2006 |title=What is "Lesbophobia"? |publisher=ILGA |url=http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileCategory=1&amp;FileID=997 |access-date=7 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220192524/http://ilga.org/ilga/en/article/997 |archive-date=20 February 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Czyzselska"&gt;{{cite news|last=Czyzselska|first=Jane|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/09/lesbophobia-homophobia-side-order-sexism|title=Lesbophobia is homophobia with a side-order of sexism|work=The Guardian|date=9 July 2013|access-date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extent==
The idea that lesbians are dangerous—while [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] interactions are natural, normal, and spontaneous—is a common example of beliefs which are lesbophobic. Like homophobia, this belief is classed as [[heteronormative]], as it assumes that heterosexuality is dominant, presumed, and normal, and that other sexual or relationship arrangements are abnormal and unnatural.&lt;ref&gt;Jillian Todd Weiss, [http://phobos.ramapo.edu/~jweiss/tulane.pdf "The Gender Caste System – Identity, Privacy, and Heteronormativity"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151013193044/http://phobos.ramapo.edu/~jweiss/tulane.pdf |date=13 October 2015 }} ''10 Law &amp; Sexuality 123'' (Tulane Law School, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; A stereotype that has been identified as lesbophobic is that female athletes are always or predominantly lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;Peper, Karen, "Female athlete=Lesbian: a complex myth constructed from gender role expectations and lesbiphobia", ''Queer words, queer images: communications and the construction of homosexuality'', pages 193–208 (New York University Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darcy Plymire and Pamela Forman, "Breaking the Silence: Lesbian Fans, the Internet, and the Sexual Politics of Women's Sport", ''International Journal of Sexuality and Gender Studies'', pages 1566–1768 (Springer Netherlands, April 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Lesbians encounter lesbophobic attitudes not only in straight men and women, but from gay men, as well as bisexual people.&lt;ref&gt;Megan Radclyffe, ''Lesbophobia!: Gay Men and Misogyny'' (Continuum, October 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Lesbophobia in gay men is regarded as manifest in the perceived subordination of lesbian issues in the campaign for [[LGBT social movements|gay rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Kristen Raizada, "An Interview with the Guerrilla Girls, Dyke Action Machine (DAM!), and the Toxic Titties", ''NWSA Journal'', pages 39–58 (Volume 19, Number 1, Spring 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-lesbian violence===
Lesbophobia is sometimes demonstrated through crimes of violence, including [[corrective rape]] and even [[murder]]. In [[South Africa]], Sizakele Sigasa (a lesbian activist living in [[Soweto]]) and her partner Salome Masooa were raped, tortured, and murdered in July 2007 in an attack that South African lesbian-[[gay rights]] organizations, including the umbrella-group Joint Working Group, said were driven by lesbophobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ndaba |first=Baldwin |title='Hate crime' against lesbians slated |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/hate-crime-against-lesbians-slated-1.361821 |publisher=IOL News |access-date=22 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329025903/http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/hate-crime-against-lesbians-slated-1.361821 |archive-date=29 March 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other rape/murders of lesbians occurred in South Africa earlier in summer 2007: Simangele Nhlapo, member of an [[HIV-positive]] support group, was raped and murdered in June, along with her two-year-old daughter; and Madoe Mafubedu, aged 16, was raped and stabbed to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pithouse |first=Richard |title=Only Protected on Paper |url=http://sacsis.org.za/site/article/644.1 |publisher=The South African Civil Society Information Service |access-date=22 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218131905/http://sacsis.org.za/site/article/644.1 |archive-date=18 December 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Erotic plasticity and sexual fluidity ==
{{See also|Sexual fluidity}}

Some argue that since sexual orientation change efforts aimed at women often include rape, they are worse than those aimed at men. Others suggest that the notion of female erotic plasticity is wishful thinking on the part of men who want to have sex with lesbians, and should be criticized for not being objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clarke|first1=Victoria|last2=Peel|first2=Elizabeth|title=Out in Psychology: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Queer Perspectives|date=2007|edition=1st|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|location=Chichester, West Sussex, England|isbn=978-0470012871}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Search of Clarke book not provide support for "sexual orientation change efforts aimed at women often include rape" and "female erotic plasticity"|date=April 2020}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Radclyffe|first1=Megan|title=Lesbophobia: Gay Men and Misogyny|date=1995|publisher=[[Cassell (publisher)|Cassell]]|isbn=0304333263}}&lt;/ref&gt;
