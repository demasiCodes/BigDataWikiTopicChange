'''Lesbophobia''' (sometimes '''Lesbiphobia''') comprises various forms of negativity toward [[lesbian]]s as individuals, as a couple or as a [[Group (sociology)|social group]]. Based on the categories of [[sex differences in humans|sex or biological gender]], [[sexual orientation]], lesbian [[Identity (social science)|identity]], and [[gender]] expression, this negativity encompasses [[prejudice]], [[discrimination]], and [[Psychological abuse|abuse]] in addition to [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and feelings ranging from [[disdain]] to [[hostility]]. As such, lesbophobia is [[sexism]] against women that [[Intersectionality|intersects]] with [[homophobia]] and vice-versa. Cynthia Petersen, a professor of law at [[University of Ottawa]], has defined ''lesbophobia'' as also including "the fear that women have of loving other women, as well as the fear that men (including [[gay]] men) have of women not loving them."&lt;ref name="petersen"&gt;Petersen, Cynthia. (1994) "Living Dangerously: Speaking Lesbian, Teaching Law."  ''Canadian Journal of Women &amp; the Law'' 7(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related terminology==
While some people use only the more general term [[homophobia]] to describe this sort of prejudice or behavior, others believe that the terms ''[[homosexual]]'' and ''homophobia'' do not adequately reflect the specific concerns of lesbians, because they experience the double discrimination of both homophobia and [[sexism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2006-12-18 |title=What is "Lesbophobia"? |publisher=ILGA |url=http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileCategory=1&amp;FileID=997 |accessdate=2007-08-07|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120220192524/http://ilga.org/ilga/en/article/997|archivedate=20 February 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[bisexual]] women may prefer to use the term [[biphobia]] to refer to prejudice or abuse that they encounter which is based on their [[bisexual]] identity or behaviour, as people who identify as [[transgender]] often prefer to use the word [[transphobia]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

==Extent of lesbophobia==
The idea that lesbians are dangerous, while [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] interactions are natural, normal and spontaneous is a common example of beliefs which are lesbophobic. Like homophobia, this belief is classed as [[heteronormative]], as it assumes that heterosexuality is dominant, presumed and normal, and that other sexual or relationship arrangements are abnormal and unnatural.&lt;ref&gt;Jillian Todd Weiss, [http://phobos.ramapo.edu/~jweiss/tulane.pdf "The Gender Caste System – Identity, Privacy, and Heteronormativity"] ''10 Law &amp; Sexuality 123'' (Tulane Law School, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; A stereotype that has been identified as lesbophobic is that female athletes are always or predominantly lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;Peper, Karen, "Female athlete=Lesbian: a complex myth constructed from gender role expectations and lesbiphobia", ''Queer words, queer images: communications and the construction of homosexuality'', pages 193–208 (New York University Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darcy Plymire and Pamela Forman, "Breaking the Silence: Lesbian Fans, the Internet, and the Sexual Politics of Women's Sport", ''International Journal of Sexuality and Gender Studies'', pages 1566–1768 (Springer Netherlands, April 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Lesbians encounter lesbophobic attitudes not only in straight men and women, but from gay men, as well as bisexual people.&lt;ref&gt;Megan Radclyffe, ''Lesbophobia!: Gay Men and Misogyny'' (Continuum, October 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Lesbophobia in gay men is regarded as manifest in the perceived subordination of lesbian issues in the campaign for [[LGBT social movements|gay rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Kristen Raizada, "An Interview with the Guerrilla Girls, Dyke Action Machine (DAM!), and the Toxic Titties", ''NWSA Journal'', pages 39–58 (Volume 19, Number 1, Spring 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lesbophobic violence===
[[File:Justice For Sizakhele &amp; Salome (8036300204).jpg|thumb|left|Soweto Pride 2012 participants remember two lesbians who were raped and murdered in 2007.]]
Lesbophobia is sometimes demonstrated through crimes of violence, including [[corrective rape]] and even [[murder]]. In [[South Africa]], Sizakele Sigasa, a lesbian activist living in [[Soweto]], and her partner Salome Masooa were raped, [[torture]]d, and murdered in July 2007 in an attack that South African lesbian-[[gay rights]] organizations, including the umbrella-group Joint Working Group, said were driven by lesbophobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ndaba|first=Baldwin|title='Hate crime' against lesbians slated|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/hate-crime-against-lesbians-slated-1.361821#.Urb7Pxb78y4|publisher=IOL News|accessdate=22 December 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6QiX1JhnL|archivedate=30 June 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two other rape/murders of lesbians occurred in South Africa earlier in summer 2007: Simangele Nhlapo, member of an [[HIV-positive]] support group was raped and murdered in June, along with her two-year-old daughter; and Madoe Mafubedu, aged 16, was raped and stabbed to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pithouse|first=Richard|title=Only Protected on Paper|url=http://sacsis.org.za/site/article/644.1|publisher=The South African Civil Society Information Service|accessdate=22 December 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6QiX79Fi5|archivedate=30 June 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Everyday Lesbophobia==
Jane Czyzselska, the editor of British lesbian magazine [[Diva (magazine)|Diva]], launched a social media campaign called Everyday Lesbophobia in 2013. She told PinkNews.co.uk, “Like the brilliant Everyday Sexism project, our Everyday Lesbophobia campaign has been set up to document instances of prejudice from serious abuse to casual put downs that have become so commonplace that we often don’t feel able to protest about them.” Everyday Lesbophobia includes a blog, Facebook page and Twitter account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Diva magazine launches campaign against ‘lesbophobia’|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/07/10/diva-magazine-launches-campaign-against-lesbophobia/|accessdate=August 18, 2014|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
