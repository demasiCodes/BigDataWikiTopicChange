'''Lesbophobia''' (sometimes '''lesbiphobia''') comprises various forms of negativity towards [[lesbian]]s as individuals, as couples, or as a [[Group (sociology)|social group]]. Based on the categories of [[sex differences in humans|sex]], [[sexual orientation]], lesbian [[Identity (social science)|identity]], and [[gender]] expression, this negativity encompasses [[prejudice]], [[discrimination]], and abuse, in addition to [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and feelings ranging from disdain to hostility. As such, lesbophobia is [[sexism]] against women that [[Intersectionality|intersects]] with [[homophobia]] and vice versa.

==Related terminology==
While some people use only the more general term ''[[homophobia]]'' to describe this sort of prejudice or behavior, others believe that the terms ''[[homosexual]]'' and ''homophobia'' do not adequately reflect the specific concerns of lesbians, because they experience the double discrimination of both homophobia and sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=18 December 2006 |title=What is "Lesbophobia"? |publisher=ILGA |url=http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileCategory=1&amp;FileID=997 |accessdate=7 August 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220192524/http://ilga.org/ilga/en/article/997|archivedate=20 February 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Czyzselska"&gt;{{cite news|last=Czyzselska|first=Jane|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/09/lesbophobia-homophobia-side-order-sexism|title=Lesbophobia is homophobia with a side-order of sexism|work=The Guardian|date=9 July 2013|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[bisexual]] women may prefer to use the term [[biphobia]] to refer to prejudice or abuse that they encounter which is based on their bisexual identity or behaviour, and people who identify as [[transgender]] often prefer to use the word [[transphobia]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}
==Extent==
The idea that lesbians are dangerous—while [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] interactions are natural, normal, and spontaneous—is a common example of beliefs which are lesbophobic. Like homophobia, this belief is classed as [[heteronormative]], as it assumes that heterosexuality is dominant, presumed, and normal, and that other sexual or relationship arrangements are abnormal and unnatural.&lt;ref&gt;Jillian Todd Weiss, [http://phobos.ramapo.edu/~jweiss/tulane.pdf "The Gender Caste System – Identity, Privacy, and Heteronormativity"] ''10 Law &amp; Sexuality 123'' (Tulane Law School, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; A stereotype that has been identified as lesbophobic is that female athletes are always or predominantly lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;Peper, Karen, "Female athlete=Lesbian: a complex myth constructed from gender role expectations and lesbiphobia", ''Queer words, queer images: communications and the construction of homosexuality'', pages 193–208 (New York University Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darcy Plymire and Pamela Forman, "Breaking the Silence: Lesbian Fans, the Internet, and the Sexual Politics of Women's Sport", ''International Journal of Sexuality and Gender Studies'', pages 1566–1768 (Springer Netherlands, April 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Lesbians encounter lesbophobic attitudes not only in straight men and women, but from gay men, as well as bisexual people.&lt;ref&gt;Megan Radclyffe, ''Lesbophobia!: Gay Men and Misogyny'' (Continuum, October 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Lesbophobia in gay men is regarded as manifest in the perceived subordination of lesbian issues in the campaign for [[LGBT social movements|gay rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Kristen Raizada, "An Interview with the Guerrilla Girls, Dyke Action Machine (DAM!), and the Toxic Titties", ''NWSA Journal'', pages 39–58 (Volume 19, Number 1, Spring 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lesbophobia is sometimes demonstrated through crimes of violence, including [[corrective rape]] and even [[murder]]. In [[South Africa]], Sizakele Sigasa (a lesbian activist living in [[Soweto]]) and her partner Salome Masooa were raped, tortured, and murdered in July 2007 in an attack that South African lesbian-[[gay rights]] organizations, including the umbrella-group Joint Working Group, said were driven by lesbophobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ndaba |first=Baldwin |title='Hate crime' against lesbians slated |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/hate-crime-against-lesbians-slated-1.361821#.Urb7Pxb78y4 |publisher=IOL News |accessdate=22 December 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6QiX1JhnL?url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/hate-crime-against-lesbians-slated-1.361821 |archivedate=30 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other rape/murders of lesbians occurred in South Africa earlier in summer 2007: Simangele Nhlapo, member of an [[HIV-positive]] support group, was raped and murdered in June, along with her two-year-old daughter; and Madoe Mafubedu, aged 16, was raped and stabbed to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pithouse |first=Richard |title=Only Protected on Paper |url=http://sacsis.org.za/site/article/644.1 |publisher=The South African Civil Society Information Service |accessdate=22 December 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6QiX79Fi5?url=http://sacsis.org.za/site/article/644.1 |archivedate=30 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Erotic plasticity and sexual fluidity ==
Many lesbians have expressed the view that there has been an emergence of a new kind of prejudice against lesbians that is distinct from the traditional form. They feel that the use of the notion of innate sexual orientation as an argument for homosexual rights, especially in the form that claim that people on average become more accepting towards homosexuality if they think it is biological, is demonizing the notion that the individual is to be respected in his or her choices regardless of origin by falsely lumping the latter notion with homophobia. They also feel that this denigration of the concept of respect for individual choice, an artificial societal polarization that fixates homosexual rights to the concept of innateness, is leaving lesbian rights more vulnerable to being attacked by the argument that women are more [[Erotic plasticity|erotically plastic]] or [[sexually fluid]] than men. Because of this argument, some lesbians report that gay men and sexologists who state that they are aligned with gay rights are demeaning lesbians because the argument is akin to stating that women do not have the same right to their sexual orientation as men because of female erotic plasticity.

Some propose that information about the problems with statistics as evidence for correlations between attitudes, such as people being socially excluded from groups with a view on one matter for a different opinion on an unrelated view and being forced into other groups or forced to lie about their attitudes, making unrelated opinions falsely appear to be linked, and argue that it may help rehabilitate the notion of respect for individual choice. Others argue that since sexual orientation change efforts aimed at women often include rape, they are worse than those aimed at men. Others suggest that the notion of female erotic plasticity is wishful thinking on the part of men who want to have sex with lesbians, and should be criticized for not being objective.&lt;ref&gt;Lesbophobia, Agnes F.

==Everyday Lesbophobia==
Jane Czyzselska, the editor of British lesbian magazine ''[[Diva (magazine)|Diva]]'', launched a social media campaign called Everyday Lesbophobia in 2013.&lt;ref name="Czyzselska"/&gt; She told ''[[PinkNews]]'' in July 2013: "Like the brilliant" [[Everyday Sexism Project]], "our Everyday Lesbophobia campaign has been set up to document instances of prejudice from serious abuse to casual put downs that have become so commonplace that we often don't feel able to protest about them." Everyday Lesbophobia includes a blog, Facebook page, and Twitter account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roberts|first=Scott|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/07/10/diva-magazine-launches-campaign-against-lesbophobia/|title=Diva magazine launches campaign against ‘lesbophobia’|work=Pink News|date=10 July 2013|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
