[[Illnesses]] are generally related to [[social]], [[economic]], [[political]], and [[environmental]] circumstances. Social determinants of health have been recognized by several health organizations such as the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] and the [[World Health Organization]] to greatly influence collective and [[person|personal]] well-being.  A list of determinants of health -- only some of which are social determinants -- compiled by the Public Health Agency of Canada is below:

# [[Income]] and [[social status]]
# [[Social network|Social support network]]s
# [[Education]] and [[literacy]], e.g. health literacy
# [[Employment]]/[[Working conditions]]
# [[Social environment]]s
# [[Natural environment|Physical environment]]s
# Personal health practices and [[coping]] skills
# Healthy [[child development]]
# [[Biology]] and [[genetics|genetic endowment]]
# [[Healthcare|Health services]]
# [[Gender]]
# [[Culture]]

The term social determinants of health grew out of the search by researchers to identify the specific exposures by which members of different socio-economic groups come to experience varying degrees of health and illness. While it was well documented that individuals in various socio-economic groups experienced differing health outcomes, the specific factors and means by which these factors led to illness remained to be identified  Overviews of the concept, recent findings, and an analysis of emerging issues are available. All these formulation share a concern with factors beyond those of biomedical and behavioural risk. The SDOH National Conference list (see Raphael, below) is unique in that it specifically focuses on the public policy environment (e.g., income and its distribution) rather than characteristics associated with individuals (e.g. income and social status).
