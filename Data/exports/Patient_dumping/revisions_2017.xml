== History ==
The term "patient dumping" was first mentioned in the New York Times in articles published in the late 1870s describing the practice of private New York hospitals transporting poor and sickly patients by horse drawn ambulance to [[NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue|Bellevue Hospital]], the city's preeminent public facility.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abel|first=Emily|date=May 2011|title=Patient Dumping in New York City, 1877–1917|url=|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=101|issue=5|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2010.300005|pmid=|access-date=|via=|pages=789–795}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jarring ride and lack of stabilized care typically resulted in death of the patient and outrage of the public. Notwithstanding the passage of city ordinances prohibiting the practice it continued.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

"Patient dumping" resurfaced in the 1980s, nationwide, with private hospitals refusing to examine or treat the poor and uninsured in the emergency departments (ED) and transferring them to public hospitals for further care and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schiff|first=Robert L.|last2=Ansell|first2=David A.|last3=Schlosser|first3=James E.|last4=Idris|first4=Ahamed H.|last5=Morrison|first5=Ann|last6=Whitman|first6=Steven|date=1986-02-27|title=Transfers to a Public Hospital|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJM198602273140905|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=314|issue=9|pages=552–557|doi=10.1056/NEJM198602273140905|issn=0028-4793|pmid=3945293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History and Health Policy in the United States: Putting the Past Back in|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2006|isbn=9780813538389|location=|pages=280|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This refusal of care resulted in patient deaths and public outcry culminating with the passage of a federal anti-patient dumping law in 1986 known as the [[Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act]].
