The current executive director is Kevin M. Cathcart.

Lambda initially was denied the right to organize as a [[not-for-profit corporation]] under the laws of the State of [[New York]], on the grounds that its proposed activities would be contrary to [[public policy]].  That decision was later overturned in a [[1973]] decision by the [[New York Court of Appeals]], that [[U.S. state|state]]'s highest [[court]].  (''In re Thom'', 301 N.E.2d 542 (N.Y. 1973).)

Lambda has played a role in many legal cases in the [[United States]] pertaining to [[gay rights]], including the 6-3 [[United States Supreme Court]]'s [[2003]] decision in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', which invalidated [[sodomy law|sodomy laws]].
