'''Lambda Legal''' (Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund) is an American [[civil rights]] organization that focuses on [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) communities as well as people living with [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] ([[People With AIDS|PWA]]s) through [[Litigation|impact litigation]], societal education, and [[public policy]] work.

== History ==
Lambda's founder William J. Thom, Esq. submitted incorporation papers for approval to the New York Courts in 1971, but his application was denied on the grounds that its proposed activities would be contrary to [[public policy]].  That decision was overturned in 1973 by the [[New York Court of Appeals]], which is the highest court of [[New York State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lambda Legal History|url=http://www.lambdalegal.org/about-us/history|work=Lambda Legal History}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''In re Thom'', 301 N.E.2d 542 (N.Y. 1973).).

The original incorporators, in addition to Bill Thom, were E. Carrington Boggan, and Michael J. Lavery.  At their first meeting on November 10, 1973, they elected to the newly constituted Board of Directors Rodney L. Eubanks, Shepherd Raimi and D. Nicholas Russo.&lt;ref name="minutes"&gt;[[Media:11-10-73 Minutes.pdf|"Minutes of the Combined Organizational Meeting and of the First Meeting of the Members and First Meeting of Directors", Lambda Legal, November 10, 1973]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the scarcity of openly gay lawyers in 1973, Lambda Legal formed a Board of Advisors of eminent New Yorkers sympathetic to the cause of [[gay rights]].  They included US Congressperson [[Bella Abzug]], NY State Senator Carol Bellamy, Association of the Bar President Merrell E. Clark, Rev. John Corn of Trinity Church and Martin Duberman, Distinguished Professor at City University of New York.&lt;ref name="minutes" /&gt; Also on the Board of Advisors were two lawyers who later became New York State Supreme Court Justices: Phyllis Gangel-Jacob and Shirley Fingerhood.

From its inception, Lambda Legal sought [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] on its Board of Directors. Initially it could find no lesbian lawyers who were willing or able to be openly associated with a gay activist organization. Nathalie Rockhill, a major figure in the early post-[[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]] days of Gay Liberation, was the first woman elected to the Board in 1974.  She was soon followed by lesbian law students and, in time, by lesbian lawyers. By the 1980s, men and women were equally represented on Lambda's board.&lt;ref&gt;Primary source - original board member, Shepherd Raimi, July 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Lambda's growth paralleled the growth of the gay movement. By the 1980s, with the advent of AIDS, gay awareness and activism had grown significantly. Thomas B. Stoddard, who was executive director from 1986 to 1992, helped to author a bill passed in 1986 by the New York City Council to protect gays against bias in housing, employment, and public accommodations. Mayor Ed Koch, who signed the bill enacting it into law said: "The legislation drafted by Tom Stoddard was perfect." In 1993, Stoddard and other national gay leaders met with president Bill Clinton, the first such delegation to meet inside the Oval Office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E0DF143FF937A25751C0A961958260 Thomas Stoddard, 48, Dies; An Advocate of Gay Rights], [[New York Times]], February 14, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Its national headquarters remain in [[New York City]], but today has regional offices in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], [[Chicago, Illinois]], [[Dallas, Texas]], and [[Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambdalegal.org/about-us/ |title=About Us |publisher=Lambda Legal |accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current executive director is Kevin M. Cathcart. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambdalegal.org/about-us/staff/ |title=Staff |publisher=Lambda Legal |accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Lambda Legal has played a role in many legal cases in the [[United States]] pertaining to [[gay rights]], including the 6-3 [[United States Supreme Court]]'s 2003 decision in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', which invalidated [[sodomy law]]s.

Lambda Legal carries out its legal work principally through test cases selected for the likelihood of their success in establishing positive legal precedents that will affect lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, transgender people and those affected by HIV. Lambda Legal's staff of attorneys works on a wide range of cases, with their docket averaging more than 50 cases at any given time.

Lambda Legal also maintains a national network of volunteer Cooperating Attorneys, which widens the scope of their legal work and allows attorneys, legal workers and law students to become involved in the program by working with Lambda Legal's legal staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Paquette|first=Monica|title=Marketplace|url=http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/PubArticleFriendlyNY.jsp?id=1202514316420&amp;slreturn=1|newspaper=New York Law Journal|date=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lambda Legal pursues litigation in all parts of the country, in every area of the law that affects communities they represent, such as discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations, and the military; HIV/AIDS-related discrimination and public policy issues; parenting and relationship issues; equal marriage rights; equal employment and domestic partnership benefits;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pinckard|first=Cliff|title=Gay-marriage ruling expected today in Iowa|url=http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2009/04/gaymarriage_ruling_expected_to.html|newspaper=The Plain Dealer|date=April 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; "sodomy" law challenges; immigration issues; anti-gay initiatives; and free speech and equal protection rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pearson|first=Sophia|last2=Dolmetsch|first2=Chris|title=New Jersey’s Civil Union Law Challenged by Rights Group|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-06-29/new-jersey-s-civil-union-law-challenged-by-rights-group.html|newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
Before taking on legal work on behalf of same-sex marriage rights, Lambda Legal had to resolve an internal debate over the significance of marriage for its constituency and the strategic wisdom of taking on the issue. In 1990, it declined to represent the plaintiffs in the [[Baehr v. Miike|initial challenge]] to Hawaii's denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. It filed an amicus brief in that case at a later stage and another in ''[[Same-sex marriage in the District of Columbia#Dean v. District of Columbia|Dean v. District of Columbia]]'', its first advocacy for same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinello |first=Daniel R.|title=America's Struggle for Same-Sex Marriage|year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521848565|pages=24-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lambda Legal publishes the "Little Black Book," which contains information regarding the possible consequences of gay men "cruising" for sex in public places.&lt;ref name="lambdalegal.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambdalegal.org/news/ny_20040203_lambda-releases-little-black-book |title=Lambda Legal Releases 'Little Black Book,' Resource Against Police Harassment And Other Dangers Gay Men Encounter When Cruising For Sex |publisher=Lambda Legal |date=February 3, 2004 |accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Little Black Book" includes the following material:  "If you cruise in parks, bathrooms or other spaces open to public view, trust your instincts, be aware of your surroundings -- and know your rights.  While Lambda Legal and other groups are fighting against the ways police target men who have sex with men, having sex where others might see you and take offense can subject you to arrest, publicity and other serious consequences. If you feel unsafe, you should leave."&lt;ref name="lambdalegal.org"/&gt;  The "Little Black Book" goes on to advise as follows:  "If you’re cruising for sex and an undercover cop hits on you, what you do can still be a crime."&lt;ref name="lambdalegal.org"/&gt;

In July 2012, Lambda founder Bill Thom was interviewed at his nursing home in [[Manhattan]], and gave a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smBcpl0-vPk first-hand account] of the early years of Lambda Legal. This resulted in a letter&lt;ref name="Lambda Legal Letter to Bill Thom, September 25, 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a0/Lambda_Legal_Letter_to_Bill_Thom_September_25%2C_2012.pdf |title=Lambda Letter to Bill Thom, September 25, 2012}} &lt;/ref&gt; from the current co-chair of Lambda Legal to Bill Thom dated September 25, 2012 in which he says "The world is a vastly better place for LGBT people than when I started practice 20 years ago and is almost unrecognizable from the world in which you took on the heroic and unprecedented task of fighting back."
