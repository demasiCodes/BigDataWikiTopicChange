'''Hate speech''' is speech that attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as gender, [[ethnic origin]], religion, race, disability, or sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hate+speech Definitions for "hate speech"], Dictionary.com. Retrieved 25 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nockleby, John T. (2000),  “Hate Speech,” in ''Encyclopedia of the American Constitution'', ed. Leonard W. Levy and Kenneth L. Karst, vol. 3. (2nd ed.), Detroit: Macmillan Reference US, pp. 1277–79.

The law may identify a protected group by certain characteristics.&lt;ref name="legislation.gov.uk"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/44/section/146 Criminal Justice Act 2003&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An Activist's Guide to The Yogyakarta Principles; p. 125 by [[Yogyakarta Principles in Action]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kinney |first=Terry A. |title=Hate Speech and Ethnophaulisms |work=The International Encyclopedia of Communication |publisher=Blackwell Reference Online |year=2008 |url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405131995_chunk_g978140513199513_ss4-1 |doi=10.1111/b.9781405131995.2008.x |accessdate=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the law of other countries, hate speech is not a legal term.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/may/07/chris-cuomo/cnns-chris-cuomo-first-amendment-doesnt-cover-hate/&lt;/ref&gt;
In some countries, a victim of hate speech may seek redress under [[Civil law (area)|civil law]], [[criminal law]], or both. A [[website]] that uses hate speech is called a ''hate site''. Most of these sites contain [[Internet forum]]s and [[news]] briefs that emphasize a particular viewpoint.

There has been debate over [[freedom of speech]], hate speech and hate speech legislation.  Critics have argued that the term "hate speech" is a contemporary example of [[Newspeak]], used to silence critics of social policies that have been poorly implemented in a rush to appear [[politically correct]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesocialcontract.com/pdf/eleven-two/xi-2-91.pdf UK-USA: The British Character of America] [[The Social Contract Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=27175|title=George Orwell meets the OIC|work=[[Human Events]]|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others point to a link between violent rhetoric and real world brutality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Veterans confront Donald Trump on hate speech |url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Veterans-confront-Donald-Trump-on-hate-speech-6889700.php |accessdate=15 June 2016|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=March 14, 2016 |author=Perry O’Brien }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=June 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Twitter|Vets_Vs_Hate|#VetsVsHate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International ==
The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) states that "any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law".&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 20&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] (ICERD) prohibits all incitement of racism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]], Article 4&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 May 2011, [[Michael O'Flaherty]] with the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] published Draft General Comment No. 34 on the ICCPR, which among other comments expressed concern that many forms of "hate speech" do not meet the level of seriousness set out in Article 20. This paragraph does not appear in the final document.&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 54 of [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/GC34.pdf "Draft general comment No. 34", UN Human Rights Committee Hundredth and first session, 3 May 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the debate over how [[freedom of speech]] applies to the Internet, conferences concerning such sites have been sponsored by the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/AllSymbols/FA869F4E19CCCBC1C1256A570031F062/$File/G0113724.doc?OpenElement ''Report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the use of the Internet for purposes of incitement to racial hatred, racist propaganda and xenophobia, and on ways of promoting international cooperation in this area''], Preparatory Committee for the World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia, and Related Intolerance, United Nations, 27 April 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enforcement of hate speech laws ===

Hate law regulations can be divided into two types: those that are designed for public order and those that are designed to protect human dignity. Those designed to protect public order seem to be somewhat ineffective because they are rarely enforced. For example, in Northern Ireland, as of 1992 only one person was prosecuted for violating the regulation in twenty one years. Those meant to protect human dignity, however, like those in Canada, Denmark, France, Germany and the Netherlands seem to be frequently enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bell|first1=Jeannine|title=Restraining the heartless: racist speech and minority rights.|journal=Indiana Law Journal|date=Summer 2009|volume=84|pages=963–979|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/hottopics/lnacademic/?verb=sr&amp;csi=7410&amp;sr=TITLE(Restraining+the+heartless%3A+racist+speech+and+minority+rights)%2BAND%2BDATE%2BIS%2B2009|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Harm of hate speech ===

Communication theory provides some insight into the harms caused by hate speech. According to the ritual model of communication, racist expressions allow minorities to be categorized with negative attributes tied to them, and are directly harmful to them. Matsuda ''et al''. (1993)&lt;ref name=Matsuda&gt;[[Mari Matsuda]], Charles R. Lawrence, III, et al., ''Words That Wound: Critical Race Theory, Assaultive Speech, and the First Amendment'' (Westview Press 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; found that racist speech could cause in the recipient of the message direct physical and emotional changes. The repeated use of such expressions cause and reinforce the subordination of these minorities. This has been enough to sway the court in previous cases such as ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' in the United States, in which the Court stated that segregation "generates a feeling of inferiority as to [African Americans’] status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone." The idea that hate speech is a mechanism of subordination is supported by scholarly evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calvert|first1=Clay|title=Hate Speech and its Harms: A Communication Theory Perspective|journal=Journal of Communication|date=1997|volume=47|pages=4–19|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/store/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1997.tb02690.x/asset/j.1460-2466.1997.tb02690.x.pdf?v=1&amp;t=i12vmye0&amp;s=e911c26285fb4ff28f0fac7c4640140bef7eb823|accessdate=October 9, 2014|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1997.tb02690.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hate speech on Facebook ===

Following a campaign that involved the participation of Women, Action and the Media, the [[Everyday Sexism Project]] and the activist Soraya Chemaly, who were among 100 advocacy groups, [[Facebook]] agreed to update its policy on hate speech. The campaign highlighted content that promoted domestic and sexual violence against women, and used over 57,000 tweets and more than 4,900 emails to create outcomes such as the withdrawal of advertising from Facebook by 15 companies, including [[Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK|Nissan UK]], House of Burlesque, and [[Nationwide Building Society|Nationwide UK]]. The social media website initially responded by stating that "While it may be vulgar and offensive, distasteful content on its own does not violate our policies",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=#FBrape: Will Facebook Heed Open Letter Protesting 'Endorsement Of Rape &amp; Domestic Violence'?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/05/28/fbrape-will-facebook-heed-open-letter-protesting-endorsement-rape-domestic-violence_n_3346520.html?utm_hp_ref=uk|accessdate=29 May 2013|newspaper=The Huffington Post UK|date=28 May 2013|author=Sara C Nelson}}&lt;/ref&gt; but then agreed to take action on May 29, 2013, after it had "become clear that our systems to identify and remove hate speech have failed to work as effectively as we would like, particularly around issues of gender-based hate."&lt;ref name="Rory Carroll"&gt;{{cite news|title=Facebook gives way to campaign against hate speech on its pages|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/may/29/facebook-campaign-violence-against-women?CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2|accessdate=29 May 2013|newspaper=The Guardian UK|date=29 May 2013|author=Rory Carroll}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rory Carroll"/&gt;

On May 31, 2016, Facebook, [[Google]],  [[Microsoft]], and [[Twitter]], jointly agreed to a [[European Union]] code of conduct obligating them to review "[the] majority of valid notifications for removal of illegal hate speech" posted on their services within 24 hours.&lt;ref name="guardian-euhatespeech"&gt;{{cite web|title=Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Microsoft sign EU hate speech code|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/31/facebook-youtube-twitter-microsoft-eu-hate-speech-code|website=The Guardian|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== By country ==

=== Australia ===
{{Main article|Hate speech laws in Australia}}

[[Australia]]'s hate speech laws vary by jurisdiction, and seek especially to prevent [[victimisation]] on account of race.

=== Belgium ===
{{Main article|Belgian Anti-Racism Law|Belgian Holocaust denial law}}

The Belgian Anti-Racism Law, in full, the ''Law of 30 July 1981 on the Punishment of Certain Acts inspired by Racism or Xenophobia'', is a law against hate speech and [[discrimination]] passed by the [[Belgian Federal Parliament|Federal Parliament]] of [[Belgium]] in 1981 which made certain acts motivated by [[racism]] or [[xenophobia]] illegal. It is also known as the ''[[Philippe Moureaux|Moureaux Law]]''.

The Belgian Holocaust denial law, passed on 23 March 1995, bans public [[Holocaust denial]]. Specifically, the law makes it illegal to publicly "deny, play down, justify or approve of the genocide committed by the [[Nazi Germany]] regime during the [[Second World War]]". Prosecution is led by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism|Centre for Equal Opportunities]]. The offense is punishable by imprisonment of up to one year and fines of up to 2500 [[Euro|EUR]].

=== Brazil ===
In [[Brazil]], according to the [[Constitution of Brazil|1988 Brazilian Constitution]], [[racism]] and other forms of race-related hate speech are "Offense(s) with no statute of limitations and no right to bail for the defendant".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u107965.shtml "1988 Constitution made racism a crime with no right to bail"], [[Folha de S.Paulo]], 15 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
{{Main article|Hate speech laws in Canada}}

In [[Canada]], advocating genocide against any "identifiable group" is an indictable offence under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']] and  carries a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment.  There is no minimum sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']], [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-318.html#h-92 RSC 1985, c C-46, s 318], "Advocating Genocide".&lt;/ref&gt;

Publicly inciting hatred against any identifiable group is also an offence.  It can be prosecuted either as an indictable offence with a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment, or as a summary conviction offence with a maximum sentence of six months imprisonment.  There are no minimum sentences in either case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-319.html#h-92 RSC 1985, c C-46, s 319] [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-319.html "Public incitement of hatred" and "Wilful promotion of hatred"].&lt;/ref&gt; The offence of publicly inciting hatred makes exceptions for cases of statements of truth, and subjects of public debate and religious doctrine. The landmark judicial decision on the constitutionality of this law was ''[[R. v. Keegstra]]'' (1990).

An "identifiable group" is defined for both offences as "any section of the public distinguished by colour, race, religion, national or ethnic origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, or mental or physical disability".

=== Chile ===

Article 31 of the "Ley sobre Libertades de Opinión e Información y Ejercicio del Periodismo" (statute on freedom of opinion and information and the performance of journalism), punishes with a large fine those who “through any means of social communication makes publications or transmissions intended to promote hatred or hostility towards persons or a group of persons due to their race, sex, religion or nationality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0718-34372011000300007&amp;lng=es&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|title=Alvaro Paúl Díaz, The Criminalization of Hate Speech in Chile in Light of Comparative Case Law (IN SPANISH), Rev. chil. derecho, 2011, vol.38, n.3, pp. 573-609.|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This law has been applied to expressions transmitted via the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0718-34372011000300007&amp;lng=es&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|title=Alvaro Paul Díaz, The Criminalization of Hate Speech in Chile in Light of Comparative Case Law (IN SPANISH), Rev. chil. derecho, 2011, vol.38, n.3, pp. 573-609.|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a rule increasing the penalties for crimes motivated by discriminatory hatred.

=== Council of Europe ===

The [[Council of Europe]] has worked intensively on this issue. While Article 10 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] does not prohibit criminal laws against [[historical revisionism (political)|revisionism]] such as denial or minimization of [[genocide]]s or [[crimes against humanity]], as interpreted by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR), the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe went further and recommended to member governments to combat hate speech under its Recommendation R (97) 20. The ECtHR does not offer an accepted definition for "hate speech" but instead offers only parameters by which prosecutors can decide if the "hate speech" is entitled to the protection of freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Web of Hate: European, U.S. Laws Clash on Defining and Policing Online Anti-Semitism|work=[[Algemeiner Journal]]|date=February 28, 2013|first=Alina Dain|last=Sharon|url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2013/02/28/a-web-of-hate-european-u-s-laws-clash-on-defining-and-policing-online-anti-semitism/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council of Europe also created the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]], which has produced country reports and several general policy recommendations, for instance against [[anti-Semitism]] and [[wikt:intolerance|intolerance]] against Muslims.

=== Croatia ===

The [[Constitution of Croatia|Croatian Constitution]] guarantees [[freedom of speech]], but Croatian penal code prohibits and punishes anyone "who based on differences of race, religion, language, political or any other belief, wealth, birth, education, social status or other properties, gender, skin color, nationality or ethnicity violates basic human rights and freedoms recognized from international community".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:hr:Kazneni zakon#Rasna i druga diskriminacija|Article 174. of Croatian penal code on Croatian Wikisource]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Denmark ===

[[Denmark]] prohibits hate speech, and defines it as publicly making statements by which a group is [[:wikt:threaten|threatened]] (''{{lang|da|trues}}''), [[:wikt:insult|insulted]] (''{{lang|da|forhånes}}'') or [[:wikt:degrade|degraded]] (''{{lang|da|nedværdiges}}'') due to race, skin colour, national or ethnic origin, faith or sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Danish Penal code, ''Straffeloven'', section 266 B.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finland ===

There has been considerable debate over the definition of "hate speech" (''vihapuhe'') in the Finnish language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/artikkeli/TV2n+Vihaillassa+ei+p%C3%A4%C3%A4sty+yksimielisyyteen+vihapuhe-k%C3%A4sitteest%C3%A4/1135269482946|title=TV2:n Vihaillassa ei päästy yksimielisyyteen vihapuhe-käsitteestä|date=20 September 2011|work=Helsing Sanomat|language=Finnish|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yle-vihailta"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/2011/09/vihapuheen_maaritelmasta_ei_yksimielisyytta_2887780.html|title=Vihapuheen määritelmästä ei yksimielisyyttä|date=21 September 2011|work=YLE Uutiset|publisher=YLE|language=Finnish|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If "hate speech" is taken to mean ethnic agitation, it is prohibited in Finland and defined in the section 11 of the penal code, ''War crimes and crimes against humanity'', as published information or as an opinion or other statement that threatens or insults a group because of race, nationality, ethnicity, religion or conviction, sexual orientation, disability, or any comparable trait. Ethnic agitation is punishable with a fine or up to 2 years in prison, or 4 months to 4 years if aggravated (such as [[incitement]] to [[genocide]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/kaannokset/1889/en18890039.pdf Finnish Penal code] ''[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1889/18890039001 Rikoslaki]/Strafflagen'' Chapter 11, section 10 Ethnic agitation / Kiihottaminen kansanryhmää vastaan&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics claim that, in political contexts, labeling certain opinions and statements "hate speech" can be used to silence unfavorable or critical opinions and suppress debate. Certain politicians, including Member of Parliament [[Jussi Halla-aho]], consider the term "hate speech" problematic because of the lack of an easy definition.&lt;ref name="yle-vihailta" /&gt;

=== France ===
{{Main article|Hate speech laws in France}}

France prohibits by its penal code and by its press laws public and private communication which is defamatory or insulting, or which incites discrimination, hatred, or violence against a person or a group of persons on account of place of origin, ethnicity or lack thereof, nationality, race, specific religion, sex, sexual orientation, or handicap. The law prohibits declarations that justify or deny crimes against humanity, for example, the Holocaust ([[Gayssot Act]]).&lt;ref&gt;Loi 90-615 du 13 juillet 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===

In [[Germany]], [[Volksverhetzung]] ("incitement of popular hatred") is a punishable offense under Section 130 of the [[Strafgesetzbuch]] (Germany's criminal code) and can lead to up to five years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dejure.org/gesetze/StGB/130.html Strafgesetzbuch §130 (1)]&lt;/ref&gt; Section 130 makes it a crime to publicly incite hatred against parts of the population or to call for violent or arbitrary measures against them or to insult, maliciously slur or defame them in a manner violating their (constitutionally protected) human dignity. Thus for instance it is illegal to publicly call certain ethnic groups "maggots" or "freeloaders".&lt;ref&gt;StGB §130 (2) 1. c)&lt;/ref&gt; Volksverhetzung is punishable in Germany even if committed abroad and even if committed by non-German citizens, if only the incitement of hatred takes effect within German territory, e.g., the [[Sedition|seditious]] sentiment was expressed in German writing or speech and made accessible in Germany (German criminal code's [[Principle of Ubiquity]], Section 9 §1 Alt. 3 and 4 of the Strafgesetzbuch).

=== Iceland ===

In [[Iceland]], the hate speech law is not confined to inciting hatred, as one can see from Article 233 a. in the Icelandic Penal Code, but includes simply expressing such hatred publicly:

: "Anyone who in a ridiculing, slanderous, insulting, threatening or any other manner publicly assaults a person or a group of people on the basis of their nationality, skin colour, race, religion or sexual orientation, shall be fined or jailed for up to 2 years." ''(In this context "assault" does not refer to physical violence but only to verbal "assault".)''

=== India ===
{{Main article|Hate speech laws in India}}

Freedom of speech and expression is protected by article 19 (1) of the constitution of India, but under article 19(2) "reasonable restrictions" can be imposed on freedom of speech and expression in the interest of "the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence".&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf Constitution of India]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indonesia ===

[[Indonesia]] has been a signatory to the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] since 2006, but has not promulgated comprehensive legislation against hate-speech crimes. Calls for a comprehensive anti-hate speech law and associated educational program have followed statements by a leader of a hard-line Islamic organization that Balinese Hindus were mustering forces to protect the "lascivious Miss World pageant" in “a war against Islam" and that "those who fight on the path of Allah are promised heaven". The statements are said to be an example of similar messages intolerance being preached throughout the country by radical clerics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/opinion/hard-liners-targeting-miss-world-in-bali-shows-need-for-anti-hate-speech-law-in-indonesia/ "Hard-Liners Targeting Miss World in Bali Shows Need for Anti-Hate-Speech Law in Indonesia"], Johannes Nugroho, ''Jakarta Globe'', 23 September 2013. Retrieved 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Police ordered all of their personnel to anticipate any potential conflicts in society caused by hate speech. The order is stipulated in the circular signed by the National Police chief General Badrodin Haiti on Oct. 8, 2015.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/10/29/national-police-anticipate-hate-speech-prevent-social-conflict.html / National Police anticipate hate speech to prevent social conflict"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ireland ===

In [[Ireland]], the right to free speech is guaranteed under the Constitution (Article 40.6.1.i), however, this is only an implied right provided that liberty of expression "shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikisource/en/wiki/Constitution_of_Ireland_%28original_text%29#FUNDAMENTAL_RIGHTS|title=Bunreacht na hÉireann Fundamental Rights|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989, proscribes words or behaviours which are "threatening, abusive or insulting and are intended or, having regard to all the circumstances, are likely to stir up hatred" against "a group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1989/en/act/pub/0019/index.html|title=Irish Statute Book Database|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2000/0922/hatred.html|title=Dublin Bus driver convicted of incitement to hatred|date=22 September 2000|work=RTÉ.ie|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===

Japanese law covers threats and slander, but it "does not apply to hate speech against general groups of people".&lt;ref&gt;[http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130710p2a00m0na009000c.html "Foreign correspondents share opinions on Japanese hate speech marches"], ''The Mainichi'', 10 July 2013.

Article 4 of the convention sets forth provisions calling for the criminalization of hate speech. But the Japanese government has suspended the provisions, saying actions to spread or promote the idea of racial discrimination have not been taken in Japan to such an extent that legal action is necessary. The Foreign Ministry says that this assessment remains unchanged.&lt;ref name=JusticeMinister-10May2013&gt;[http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201305100069 "Justice minister criticizes hate speech in Japan but won't punish offenders"], ''The Asahi Shimbun'', 10 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, the [[United Nations]] [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (CESCR) warned the Japanese government that it needs to take measures to curb hate speech against so-called "[[comfort women]]", or Asian women forced into [[sexual slavery]] by the Japanese military during [[World War II]]. The committee's recommendation called for the Japanese government to better educate Japanese society on the plight of women who were forced into sexual slavery to prevent stigmatization, and to take necessary measures to repair the lasting effects of exploitation, including addressing their right to compensation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=2972061 "UN group urges Tokyo to curb hate speech"], Sarah Kim, ''Korea JoongAng Daily'', 24 May 2013.

In 2013, following demonstrations, parades, and comments posted on the Internet threatening violence against foreign residents of Japan, especially Koreans, there are concerns that hate speech is a growing problem in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/07/10/national/politicians-silent-on-curbing-hate-speech/ "Politicians silent on curbing hate speech"], Eric Johnston, ''Japan Times'', 10 July 2013.

=== New Zealand ===

[[New Zealand]] prohibits hate speech under the Human Rights Act 1993. Section 61 (Racial Disharmony) makes it unlawful to publish or distribute "threatening, abusive, or insulting...matter or words likely to excite hostility against or bring into contempt any group of persons...on the ground of the colour, race, or ethnic or national or ethnic origins of that group of persons". Section 131 (Inciting Racial Disharmony) lists offences for which "racial disharmony" creates liability.

=== Serbia ===

The [[Serbia]]n constitution guarantees [[freedom of speech]], but restricts it in certain cases to protect the rights of others. The criminal charge of "Provoking ethnic, racial and religion based animosity and intolerance" carries a minimum six months prison term and a maximum of ten years.&lt;ref&gt;Serbian Penal code, section 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Singapore ===

[[Singapore]] has passed numerous laws that prohibit speech that causes disharmony among various religious groups.  The [[Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act]] is an example of such legislation. The Penal Code criminalizes the deliberate promotion by someone of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different racial and religious groups on grounds of race or religion. It also makes it an offence for anyone to deliberately wound the religious or racial feelings of any person.

=== South Africa ===

In [[South Africa]], hate speech (along with incitement to violence and propaganda for war) is specifically excluded from protection of free speech in the [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]]. The [[Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act, 2000]] contains the following clause:

=== United States ===

==== Constitutional framework ====

The 1789 [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] of the United States of America dealt only with the three heads of power—[[legislative]], [[executive (government)|executive]], and [[judicial]]—and sketched the basic outlines of federalism in the last four articles. The protection of civil rights was not written into the original Constitution but was added two years later with the [[Bill of Rights to the United States Constitution|Bill of Rights]], implemented as several amendments to the Constitution. The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], ratified December 15, 1791, states:
{{quote|Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.}}

Although this section was considered only to apply to the federal congress (i.e. the legislative branch), the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]], ratified on July 9, 1868, clarifies that this prohibition applies to laws of the states as well.

Some state constitutions also have a "free speech" provision, most notably, [[Constitution of California|that of California]].&lt;ref&gt;see [[Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins]], notable for the "[[positive liberty]]" interpretation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Supreme Court case law ====

Some limits on expression were contemplated by the framers and have been read into the Constitution by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] (SCOTUS). In 1942, Justice [[Frank Murphy]] summarized the case law: "There are certain well-defined and limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise a Constitutional problem. These include the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous and the insulting or 'fighting' words – those which by their very utterances inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace."&lt;ref&gt;''Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire'', 315 U.S. 568, 572 (1942)&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, however, if the speech did not fall within one of the above categorical exceptions, it was protected speech. In 1969, the Supreme Court protected a [[Ku Klux Klan]] member’s racist speech and created the "imminent danger" test to permit hate speech. The court ruled in ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'' that; "The constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a state to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force, or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action."&lt;ref&gt;''Brandenburg v. Ohio'', 395 U.S. 444, at 447 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

This test has been modified very little from its inception in 1969 and the formulation is still good law in the United States. Only speech that poses an imminent danger of unlawful action, where the speaker has the intention to incite such action and there is the likelihood that this will be the consequence of his or her speech, may be restricted and punished by that law.

In ''[[R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul]]'', (1992), the issue of freedom to express hatred arose again when a gang of white people burned a cross in the front yard of a black family. The local ordinance in [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], Minnesota, criminalized such racist and hate-filled expressions and the teenager was charged thereunder. [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[Antonin Scalia]], writing for the Supreme Court, held that the prohibition against hate speech was unconstitutional as it contravened the First Amendment. The Supreme Court struck down the ordinance. Scalia explicated the fighting words exception as follows: “The reason why fighting words are categorically excluded from the protection of the First Amendment is not that their content communicates any particular idea, but that their content embodies a particularly intolerable (and socially unnecessary) mode of expressing whatever idea the speaker wishes to convey”.&lt;ref&gt;''R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul'', 505 U.S. 377 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the hate speech ordinance was not concerned with the mode of expression, but with the content of expression, it was a violation of the freedom of speech. Thus, the Supreme Court embraced the idea that hate speech is permissible unless it will lead to imminent hate violence.&lt;ref&gt;It should be noted that SCOTUS will uphold a law that punishes hate violence as an aggravating factor in the normal sentencing guidelines. In ''Wisconsin v. Mitchell'', 508 U.S. 476 (1993) a gang of black youths beat up a white teenager because he was white. The Supreme Court upheld the Wisconsin law that considering the hate based crime in an assault as an aggravating factor is not in contravention of the first amendment.&lt;/ref&gt; The opinion noted "This conduct, if proved, might well have violated various Minnesota laws against arson, criminal damage to property", among a number of others, none of which was charged, including threats to any person, not to only protected classes.

In 2011, the Supreme Court issued their ruling on ''[[Snyder v. Phelps]],'' which concerned the right of the Westboro Baptist Church to protest with signs found offensive by many Americans. The issue presented was whether the 1st Amendment protected the expressions written on the signs. In an 8–1 decision the court sided with Phelps, the head of Westboro Baptist Church, thereby confirming their historically strong protection of hate speech, so long as it doesn't promote imminent violence. The Court explained, "speech deals with matters of public concern when it can 'be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community' or when it 'is a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/get-involved/constitution-activities/first-amendment/protests-flash-mobs/facts-case-summary.aspx|title=Facts and Case Summary: ''Snyder v. Phelps''|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Societal implementation ====
In the 1980s and 1990s, more than 350 public universities adopted "[[speech code]]s" regulating discriminatory speech by faculty and students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/free-speech-on-public-college-campuses "Free speech on public college campuses"], Kermit L. Hall, First Amendment Center, 13 September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; These codes have not fared well in the courts, where they are frequently overturned as violations of the First Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Doe v. Michigan'' (1989),  ''UWM Post v. Board of Regents of University of Wisconsin'' (1991), ''Dambrot v. Central Michigan University'' (1995), ''[[Corry v. Stanford]]'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Debate over restriction of "hate speech" in public universities has resurfaced with the adoption of anti-harassment codes covering discriminatory speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/c8471v256244nn2k/ "Harassment policies in the university"], Alan Charles Kors, ''Society'', vol. 28, no.4 (May/June 1991), pp.22–30, Springer, {{ISSN|0147-2011}} (Print), {{ISSN|1936-4725}} (Online)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== NTIA report ====

In 1992, Congress directed the [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]] (NTIA) to examine the role of telecommunications, including broadcast radio and television, cable television, public access television, and computer bulletin boards, in advocating or encouraging violent acts and the commission of hate crimes against designated persons and groups. The NTIA study investigated speech that fostered a climate of hatred and prejudice in which hate crimes may occur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=157948 ''Role of Telecommunications in Hate Crimes, Report to Congress''], J L Gattuso; B Harris; C E Mattey; C A Nila; and T Sloan, NCJ 157948, National Telecommunication and Information Administration, United States Department of Commerce, 1993, 84 pp.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The study failed to link telecommunication to hate crimes, but did find that "individuals have used telecommunications to disseminate messages of hate and bigotry to a wide audience."  Its recommendation was that the best way to fight hate speech was through additional speech promoting tolerance, as opposed to government regulation.&lt;ref name="Munro"&gt;{{cite book |last=Munro |first=Victoria |date=May 12, 2014 |title=Hate Crime in the Media: A History |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael"&gt;{{cite book |last=Michael |first=George  |date=Sep 2, 2003 |title=Confronting Right Wing Extremism and Terrorism in the USA |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;
