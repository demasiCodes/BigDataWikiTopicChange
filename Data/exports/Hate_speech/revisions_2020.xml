'''Hate speech''' is defined by the [[Cambridge Dictionary]] as "public speech that expresses hate or encourages violence towards a person or group based on something such as race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation".&lt;ref&gt;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/hate-speech&lt;/ref&gt; Hate speech is "usually thought to include communications of animosity or disparagement of an individual or a group on account of a group characteristic such as race, colour, national origin, sex, disability, religion, or sexual orientation".&lt;ref&gt;Nockleby, John T. (2000), "Hate Speech" in ''Encyclopedia of the American Constitution'', ed. Leonard W. Levy and Kenneth L. Karst, vol. 3. (2nd ed.), Detroit: Macmillan Reference US, pp. 1277–79.

There has been much debate over [[freedom of speech]], hate speech and hate speech legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://assets.cambridge.org/97805211/91098/frontmatter/9780521191098_frontmatter.pdf |title=Herz, Michael and Peter Molnar, eds. 2012.

==Hate speech laws==
{{Main|Hate speech laws by country}}
A majority of developed democracies have laws that restrict hate speech, including Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, India, South Africa, Sweden, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-051517-012343|doi-access=free|title=Free Speech and Hate Speech|year=2019|last1=Howard|first1=Jeffrey W.|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|volume=22|pages=93–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States does not have hate speech laws, since the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] has repeatedly ruled that laws criminalizing hate speech violate the guarantee to [[freedom of speech]] contained in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref name="volokh" /&gt;

Laws against hate speech can be divided into two types: those intended to preserve public order and those intended to protect human dignity. The laws designed to protect public order require that a higher threshold be violated, so they are not often enforced. For example, in Northern Ireland, as of 1992, only one person has been prosecuted for violating the regulation in 21 years. The laws meant to protect human dignity have a much lower threshold for violation, so those in Canada, Denmark, France, Germany and the Netherlands tend to be more frequently enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bell|first1=Jeannine|title=Restraining the heartless: racist speech and minority rights.|journal=Indiana Law Journal|date=Summer 2009|volume=84|pages=963–79|url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?verb=sr&amp;csi=7410&amp;sr=TITLE(Restraining+the+heartless%3A+racist+speech+and+minority+rights)%2BAND%2BDATE%2BIS%2B2009|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary==

Several activists and scholars have criticized the practice of limiting hate speech. Civil liberties activist [[Nadine Strossen]] says that, while efforts to censor hate speech have the goal of protecting the most vulnerable, they are ineffective and may have the opposite effect: disadvantaged and ethnic minorities being charged with violating laws against hate speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Nadine|last=Strossen|authorlink=Nadine Strossen|url=https://www.spiked-online.com/2018/12/14/minorities-suffer-the-most-from-hate-speech-laws/|title=Minorities suffer the most from hate-speech laws|website=[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]|date=14 December 2018|language=en|access-date=5 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kim Holmes]], Vice President of the conservative [[Heritage Foundation]] and a critic of hate speech theory, has argued that it "assumes [[bad faith]] on the part of people regardless of their stated intentions" and that it "obliterates the ethical responsibility of the individual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kim|last=Holmes|authorlink=Kim Holmes|url=https://www.heritage.org/civil-society/commentary/the-origins-hate-speech|title=The Origins of "Hate Speech"|website=heritage.org|publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]]|date=October 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebecca Ruth Gould, a professor of Eurasian and Russian Studies at [[Harvard University]], argues that laws against hate speech constitute [[viewpoint discrimination]] (prohibited by [[First Amendment]] jurisprudence in the United States) as the legal system punishes some viewpoints but not others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Rebecca Ruth |last=Gould|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3284999|title=Is the 'Hate'in Hate Speech the 'Hate'in Hate Crime? Waldron and Dworkin on Political Legitimacy|journal=Jurisprudence|date=15 November 2018|ssrn=3284999}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also positive benefits to hate speech that are often overlooked. Allowing hate speech provides a more accurate view of the human condition, provides opportunities to  change people's minds, and identifies certain people that may need to be avoided in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Conklin|first=Michael|date=2020|title=The Overlooked Benefits of 'Hate Speech': Not Just the Lesser of Two Evils|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3604244|language=en|location=Rochester, NY|ssrn=3604244}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{according to whom|date=August 2020}}

Political philosopher Jeffrey W. Howard considers the popular framing of hate speech as "free speech vs. other political values" as a mischaracterization. He refers to this as the "balancing model", and says it seeks to weigh the benefit of free speech against other values such as dignity and equality for historically marginalized groups. Instead, he believes that the crux of debate should be whether or not freedom of expression is inclusive of hate speech.&lt;ref name="Howard"/&gt; Research indicates that when people support censoring hate speech, they are motivated more by concerns about the effects the speech has on others than they are about its effects on themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Lei|last1=Guo|first2=Brett G.|last2=Johnson|title=Third-Person Effect and Hate Speech Censorship on Facebook|journal=Social Media + Society|date=April 2020|volume=6|issue=2|doi=10.1177/2056305120923003|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;
