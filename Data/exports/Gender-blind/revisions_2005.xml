An example would be a [[college]] offering a gender-blind [[dormitory]]. In the gender-blind dorm, roommates could be assigned without regard to any personâ€™s sex.  This allows [[transgender]] persons and persons who do not accept gender labels to live in more comfortable settings than may otherwise be possible in single-sex housing. It is also good for [[heterosexual]]s who otherwise couldn't live with their partners while at the university.

The first gender-blind dorm in the [[United States]] opened in the fall of [[2003]] on the campus of [[Wesleyan University]] in [[Middletown, Connecticut]].

Hair stylists and [[beauty salon]]s that serve both men and women are often referred to as ''unisex'', although that usage was probably more common in the [[1980s]] when men first started to go to hair stylists in large numbers instead of to [[barber]]s.

== Choice of words ==

''Unisex'' is an older term and some feel it carries the connotation of actually being ''duo''-sex, whereas ''gender-blind'' goes against most tenets of [[heteronormativity]], by not looking at gender at all.
