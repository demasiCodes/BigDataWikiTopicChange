An example would be a college offering a gender-blind dormitory. In the gender-blind dorm, roommates could be assigned without regard to any personâ€™s sex.  This allows [[transgender]] persons and persons who do not accept gender labels to live in more comfortable settings than may otherwise be possible in single-sex housing. It is also good for heterosexuals who otherwise couldn't live with their partners while at the university. 

The first gender-blind dorm in the [[United States]] opened in the fall of [[2003]] on the campus of [[Wesleyan University]] in [[Middletown, Connecticut]]. 

== Choice of words ==

''Unisex'' is an older term and some feel it carries the connotation of actually being ''duo''-sex, whereas ''gender-blind'' goes against most tenets of [[heteronormativity]], by not looking at gender at all.
