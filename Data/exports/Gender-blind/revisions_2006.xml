'''Gender-blind''' (or '''unisex''') is a term describing activities undertaken and services provided without regard to the [[gender]] of those who participate.

An example would be a [[college]] offering a gender-blind [[dormitory]]. In the gender-blind dorm, roommates could be assigned without regard to any person’s sex.  This allows [[transgender]] persons and persons who do not accept gender labels to live in more comfortable settings than may otherwise be possible in single-sex housing. It is also good for [[heterosexual]]s who otherwise couldn't live with their partners while at the university.

Hair stylists and [[beauty salon]]s that serve both men and women are often referred to as ''unisex'', although that usage was probably more common in the [[1980s]] when men first started to go to hair stylists in large numbers instead of to [[barber]]s.

== Choice of words ==

''Unisex'' is an older term, and a [[misnomer]] meaning, "one sex". Some feel it carries the connotation of being ''duo''-sex, (which would mean ''two at the same time'') and many being afraid to use the more appropriate term, ''bisex'', because of the sexual connotations. Whereas, ''gender-blind'' goes against most tenets of [[heteronormativity]], by not looking at gender at all.
