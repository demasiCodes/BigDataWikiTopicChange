The '''International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination''' ('''ICERD''') is a United Nations [[Treaty|convention]]. A [[Three generations of human rights|third-generation]] human rights instrument, the Convention commits its members to the elimination of [[racial discrimination]] and the promotion of understanding among all races.&lt;ref name=Art2.1&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention also requires its parties to criminalize [[hate speech]] and criminalize membership in racist organizations.&lt;ref name=Art4&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention also includes an individual complaints mechanism, effectively making it enforceable against its parties. This has led to the development of a limited jurisprudence on the interpretation and implementation of the Convention.

The convention was adopted and opened for signature by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 21 December 1965,&lt;ref name=UNGA2106&gt;United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2106 (XX), 21 December 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; and entered into force on 4 January 1969. As of July 2020, it has 88 signatories and 182 parties.&lt;ref name="UNTC-CERD"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-2&amp;chapter=4&amp;clang=_en|title=2. International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination
|publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention is monitored by the [[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] (CERD).

== Genesis ==
In December 1960, following incidents of [[antisemitism]] in several parts of the world,&lt;ref name=Lerner&gt;{{harvnb|Lérner|1980|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted a resolution condemning "all manifestations and practices of racial, religious and national hatred" as violations of the [[United Nations Charter]] and [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and calling on the governments of all states to "take all necessary measures to prevent all manifestations of racial, religious and national hatred".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1510 (XV), 12 December 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] followed this up by drafting a resolution on "manifestations of racial prejudice and national and religious intolerance", calling on governments to educate the public against intolerance and rescind discriminatory laws.&lt;ref name=UNGA1779&gt;United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1779 (XVII), 7 December 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of time prevented this from being considered by the General Assembly in 1961,&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1684 (XVI), 18 December 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was passed the next year.&lt;ref name=UNGA1779/&gt;

During the early debate on this resolution, African nations led by the [[Central African Republic]], [[Chad]], [[Republic of Dahomey|Dahomey]], [[Guinea]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]], and [[Republic of Upper Volta|Upper Volta]] pushed for more concrete action on the issue, in the form of an international convention against racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lérner|1980|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some nations preferred a declaration rather than a binding convention, while others wanted to deal with racial and religious intolerance in a single instrument.&lt;ref name=Schwelb&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schwelb |first=Egon |title=The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination |journal=International &amp; Comparative Law Quarterly |volume=15 |pages=996–1068 |year=1966 |issue=4 |doi=10.1093/iclqaj/15.4.996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eventual compromise, forced by the Arab nations' political opposition to treating religious intolerance at the same time as racial intolerance plus other nations' opinion that religious intolerance was less urgent,&lt;ref name=Schwelb999&gt;Schwelb, p. 999.&lt;/ref&gt; was for two resolutions, one calling for a declaration and draft convention aimed at eliminating racial discrimination,&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1780 (XVII), 7 December 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; the other doing the same for [[religious intolerance]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1781 (XVII), 7 December 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 4, criminalizing incitement to racial discrimination, was also controversial in the drafting stage. In the first debate of the article, there were two drafts, one presented by the United States and one by the [[Soviet Union]] and [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]]. The United States, supported by the United Kingdom, proposed that only incitement "resulting in or likely to result in violence" should be prohibited, whereas the Soviet Union wanted to "prohibit and disband racist, fascist and any other organization practicing or inciting racial discrimination". The [[Nordic countries]] proposed a compromise in which a clause of "due regard" to the rights Universal Declaration of Human Rights was added to be taken into account when crimininalizing hate speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hoover.org/research/sordid-origin-hate-speech-laws |title=The Sordid Origin of Hate-Speech Laws |last= Mchangama |first=Jacob |publisher=[[Hoover Institution]] |date=1 December 2011 |access-date=16 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The draft [[Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] was adopted by the General Assembly on 20 November 1963.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1904 (XVIII), 20 November 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; The same day the General Assembly called for the Economic and Social Council and the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|Commission on Human Rights]] to make the drafting of a Convention on the subject an absolute priority.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1906 (XVIII), 20 November 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; The draft was completed by mid-1964,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lérner|1980|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but delays in the General Assembly meant that it could not be adopted that year.&lt;ref name=Schwelb999/&gt; It was finally adopted on 21 December 1965.&lt;ref name=UNGA2106/&gt;

== Core provisions ==
=== Definition of "racial discrimination" ===
{{main|Racism|Discrimination}}
'''Preamble''' of the Convention reaffirms dignity and [[equality before the law]] citing Charter of United Nations and [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and condemns colonialism citing [[Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples]], [[Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] and also cites [[Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention|ILO Convention on Employment and Occupation (C111)]] and [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]] against discrimination.

'''Article 1''' of the Convention defines "racial discrimination" as:

{{quote|... any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], colour, descent, or national or [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Distinctions made on the basis of [[citizenship]] (that is, between citizens and non-citizens) are specifically excluded from the definition, as are [[positive discrimination]] policies and other measures taken to redress imbalances and promote equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Articles 1.2 and 1.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition does not distinguish between discrimination based on [[ethnicity]] and discrimination based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], despite the following statement by [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] in the United Nations Economic and Social Council.&lt;!--what happened here?--&gt;
{{quote| 6. National, religious, geographic, linguistic and cultural groups do not necessarily coincide with racial groups; and the cultural traits of such groups have no demonstrated genetic connection with racial traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Metraux|first=A.|date=1951|title=United Nations Economic and Security Council, Statement by Experts on Problems of Race|url=https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1525/aa.1951.53.1.02a00370|journal=American Anthropologist|language=en|volume=53|issue=1|pages=142–145|doi=10.1525/aa.1951.53.1.02a00370|issn=1548-1433}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The clear conclusion in the report is that Race and Ethnicity can be correlated, but must not get mixed up. The inclusion of descent specifically covers discrimination on the basis of [[caste]] and other forms of inherited status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/f0902ff29d93de59c1256c6a00378d1f?Opendocument |title=CERD General Recommendation No. 29: Art.1, par.1 of the Convention (Descent) |access-date=2008-06-05 |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=1 November 2002 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213112032/http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/%28Symbol%29/f0902ff29d93de59c1256c6a00378d1f?Opendocument |archive-date=13 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination need not be strictly based on race or ethnicity for the Convention to apply. Rather, whether a particular action or policy discriminates is judged by its effects.&lt;ref name="CERD-GC14"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/d7bd5d2bf71258aac12563ee004b639e?Opendocument |title=CERD General Recommendation No. 14: Definition of discrimination (Art.1, par.1) |access-date=2008-06-05 |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=22 March 1993 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213111954/http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/%28Symbol%29/d7bd5d2bf71258aac12563ee004b639e?Opendocument |archive-date=13 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In seeking to determine whether an action has an effect contrary to the Convention, it will look to see whether that action has an unjustifiable disparate impact upon a group distinguished by race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin.&lt;ref name="CERD-GC14"/&gt;}}

The question of whether an individual belongs to a particular racial group is to be decided, in the absence of justification to the contrary, by self-identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/3ae0a87b5bd69d28c12563ee0049800f?Opendocument |title=CERD General Recommendation No. 08: Identification with a particular racial or ethnic group |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=22 August 1990 |access-date=2010-10-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711125515/http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/%28Symbol%29/3ae0a87b5bd69d28c12563ee0049800f?Opendocument |archive-date=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prevention of discrimination ===
{{Main|Anti-discrimination law|Equality before the law|Institutionalized discrimination}}

'''Article 2''' of the Convention condemns racial discrimination and obliges parties to "undertake to pursue by all appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating racial discrimination in all its forms".&lt;ref name=Art2.1 /&gt; It also obliges parties to promote understanding among all races.&lt;ref name=Art2.1/&gt; To achieve this, the Convention requires that signatories:

* Not practice racial discrimination in public institutions&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 2.1(a)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Not "sponsor, defend, or support" racial discrimination&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 2.1(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Review existing policies, and amend or revoke those that cause or perpetuate racial discrimination&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 2.1(c)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prohibit "by all appropriate means, including legislation," racial discrimination by individuals and organisations within their jurisdictions&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 2.1(d)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Encourage groups, movements, and other means that eliminate barriers between races, and discourage racial division&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 2.1(e)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parties are obliged "when the circumstances so warrant" to use [[positive discrimination]] policies for specific racial groups to guarantee "the full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms".&lt;ref name=Art2.2&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 2.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these measures must be finite, and "shall in no case entail as a consequence the maintenance of unequal or separate rights for different racial groups after the objectives for which they were taken have been achieved".&lt;ref name=Art2.2/&gt;

'''Article 5''' expands upon the general obligation of Article 2 and creates a specific obligation to guarantee the right of everyone to [[equality before the law]] regardless of "race, colour, or national or ethnic origin".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It further lists specific rights this equality must apply to: equal treatment by courts and tribunals,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 5(a)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[security of the person]] and freedom from violence,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 5(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[civil and political rights]] affirmed in the ICCPR,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Articles 5(c) and (d)}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[economic, social and cultural rights]] affirmed in the ICESCR,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 5(e)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the right of access to any place or service used by the general public, "such as transport hotels, restaurants, cafes, theatres and parks."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 5(f)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list is not exhaustive, and the obligation extends to all human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/8b3ad72f8e98a34c8025651e004c8b61?Opendocument |title=CERD General Recommendation No. 20: Non-discriminatory implementation of rights and freedoms |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=15 March 1996 |access-date=2009-10-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213111923/http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/%28Symbol%29/8b3ad72f8e98a34c8025651e004c8b61?Opendocument |archive-date=13 February 2008 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Article 6''' obliges parties to provide "effective protection and remedies" through the courts or other institutions for any act of racial discrimination.&lt;ref name=Art6&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes a right to a [[legal remedy]] and [[damages]] for injury suffered due to discrimination.&lt;ref name=Art6/&gt;

=== Condemnation of apartheid ===
{{main|Crime of apartheid}}
'''Article 3''' condemns [[apartheid]] and [[racial segregation]] and obliges parties to "prevent, prohibit and eradicate" these practices in territories under their jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article has since been strengthened by the recognition of apartheid as a [[crime against humanity]] in the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]].&lt;ref&gt;Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, Article 7.1(j).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination regards this article as also entailing an obligation to eradicate the consequences of past policies of segregation, and to prevent racial segregation arising from the actions of private individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/18c91e92601301fbc12563ee004c45b6?Opendocument |title=CERD General Recommendation No. 19: Racial segregation and apartheid |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=18 August 1995 |access-date=2009-10-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912000945/http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/%28Symbol%29/18c91e92601301fbc12563ee004c45b6?Opendocument |archive-date=12 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prohibition of incitement ===
{{main|Hate speech|Hate crime|Incitement to ethnic or racial hatred}}
'''Article 4''' of the Convention condemns propaganda and organizations that attempt to justify discrimination or are based on the idea of racial [[supremacism]].&lt;ref name=Art4/&gt; It obliges parties, "with due regard to the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights", to adopt "immediate and positive measures" to eradicate these forms of incitement and discrimination.&lt;ref name=Art4/&gt; Specifically, it obliges parties to criminalize [[hate speech]], [[hate crimes]] and the financing of racist activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 4(a)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to prohibit and criminalize membership in organizations that "promote and incite" racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 4(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of parties have reservations on this article, and interpret it as not permitting or requiring measures that infringe on the freedoms of speech, association or assembly.&lt;ref&gt;See "Reservations" below for more details.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination regards this article as a mandatory obligation of parties to the Convention,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/c5a2e04b85557870c12563ee003e883f?Opendocument |title=CERD General Recommendation No. 07: Legislation to eradicate racial discrimination |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=23 August 1985 |access-date=2009-10-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912001400/http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/%28Symbol%29/c5a2e04b85557870c12563ee003e883f?Opendocument |archive-date=12 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has repeatedly criticized parties for failing to abide by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/09bca82e6dab7b8fc12563ee0039c575?Opendocument |title=CERD General Recommendation No. 01: States parties' obligations Art. 4 |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=25 February 1972 |access-date=2009-10-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912000927/http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/%28Symbol%29/09bca82e6dab7b8fc12563ee0039c575?Opendocument |archive-date=12 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It regards the obligation as consistent with the [[Freedom of speech|freedoms of opinion and expression]] affirmed in the UNDHR and ICCPR&lt;ref name=CERDGR15&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/e51277010496eb2cc12563ee004b9768?Opendocument |title=CERD General Recommendation No. 15: Organized violence based on ethnic origin |pages=paragraph 4 |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=23 March 1993 |access-date=2009-10-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912001440/http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/%28Symbol%29/e51277010496eb2cc12563ee004b9768?Opendocument |archive-date=12 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and notes that the latter specifically outlaws inciting racial discrimination, hatred and violence.&lt;ref&gt;ICCPR, Article 20.2.&lt;/ref&gt; It views the provisions as necessary to prevent organised racial violence and the "political exploitation of ethnic difference."&lt;ref&gt;''CERD General Recommendation No. 15'', Paragraph 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promotion of tolerance ===
{{main|Toleration}}
'''Article 7''' obliges parties to adopt "immediate and effective measures", particularly in education, to combat racial prejudice and encourage understanding and [[Toleration|tolerance]] between different racial, ethnic and national groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dispute resolution mechanism ===
'''Articles 11 through 13''' of the Convention establish a dispute resolution mechanism between parties. A party that believes another party is not implementing the Convention may complain to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee will pass on the complaint, and if it is not resolved between the two parties, may establish an ad hoc Conciliation Commission to investigate and make recommendations on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Articles 12 &amp; 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure has been first invoked in 2018, by Qatar against Saudi Arabia and UAE&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=23566&amp;LangID=E CERD information note on inter-state communications]&lt;/ref&gt; and by Palestine against Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ejiltalk.org/icerd-and-palestines-inter-state-complaint/ |title=ICERD and Palestine's Inter-State Complaint |date=30 April 2018 |publisher=EJIL: Talk! |access-date=2018-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Article 22''' further allows any dispute over the interpretation or application of the Convention to be referred to the [[International Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This clause has been invoked three times, by Georgia against Russia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/en/case/140 |title=Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v.

=== Individual complaints mechanism ===
'''Article 14''' of the Convention establishes an individual complaints mechanism similar to that of the [[First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] and [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]]. Parties may at any time recognise the competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to consider complaints from individuals or groups who claim their rights under the Convention have been violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 14 (1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such parties may establish local bodies to hear complaints before they are passed on.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 14 (2)–(5)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complainants must have exhausted all domestic remedies, and anonymous complaints and complaints that refer to events that occurred before the country concerned joined Convention are not permitted.&lt;ref name="ICERD, Article 14 6 &amp; 7"&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Articles 14 (6) &amp; (7)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee can request information from and make recommendations to a party.&lt;ref name="ICERD, Article 14 6 &amp; 7"/&gt;

The individual complaints mechanism came into operation in 1982, after it had been accepted by ten states-parties.&lt;ref name=icmart14&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, 58 states had recognised the competence of the Committee,&lt;ref name=UNTC-CERD/&gt; and 54 cases have been dealt with by the Committee.&lt;ref name=compstatus&gt;{{cite web |title=Status of communications dealt with by CERD under Art. 14 Procedure |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/CERDSURVEYArt14.xls |publisher=UN CERD |date=22 July 2010|access-date=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reservations ==
A number of parties have made reservations and interpretative declarations to their application of the Convention. The Convention text forbids reservations "incompatible with the object and purpose of this Convention" or that would inhibit the operation of any body established by it.&lt;ref name=Art20.2&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 20.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reservation is considered incompatible or inhibitive if two-thirds of parties object to it.&lt;ref name=Art20.2/&gt;

;Article 22
[[Afghanistan]], [[Bahrain]], [[China]], [[Cuba]], [[Egypt]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Iraq]], [[Israel]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[Madagascar]], [[Morocco]], [[Mozambique]], [[Nepal]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Syria]], [[Thailand]], [[Turkey]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Yemen]] do not consider themselves bound by Article 22. Some interpret this article as allowing disputes to be referred to the [[International Court of Justice]] only with the consent of all involved parties.&lt;ref name=UNTC-CERD/&gt;

;Obligations beyond existing constitution
[[Antigua and Barbuda]], the [[Bahamas]], [[Barbados]], [[Guyana]], [[Jamaica]], [[Nepal]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Thailand]] and United States interpret the Convention as not implying any obligations beyond the limits of their existing constitutions.&lt;ref name=UNTC-CERD/&gt;

;Hate speech
[[Austria]], [[Belgium]], France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, [[Malta]], [[Monaco]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Tonga]] all interpret Article 4 as not permitting or requiring measures that threaten the freedoms of speech, opinion, association, and assembly.&lt;ref name=UNTC-CERD/&gt; [[Antigua and Barbuda]], the [[Bahamas]], [[Barbados]], [[Fiji]], [[Nepal]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Thailand]] and United Kingdom interpret the Convention as creating an obligation to enact measures against hate speech and hate crimes only when a need arises.

The United States of America "does not accept any obligation under this Convention, in particular under articles 4 and 7, to restrict those [extensive protections of individual freedom of speech, expression and association contained in the Constitution and laws of the United States], through the adoption of legislation or any other measures, to the extent that they are protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States."&lt;ref name=UNTC-CERD/&gt;

;Immigration
[[Monaco]] and [[Switzerland]] reserve the right to apply their own legal principles on the entry of foreigners into their labour markets.&lt;ref name=UNTC-CERD/&gt; The United Kingdom does not regard the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962]] and [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968]] as constituting any form of racial discrimination.&lt;ref name=UNTC-CERD/&gt;

;Indigenous people

[[Tonga]] reserves the right not to apply the Convention to any restriction on the alienation of land held by indigenous [[Tongans]]. [[Fiji]] has significant reservations around Article 5, and reserves the right not to implement those provisions if they are incompatible with existing law on voting rights, the alienation of land by indigenous [[Fijians]].&lt;ref name=UNTC-CERD/&gt;

== Jurisprudence ==
===At the CERD===
The individual complaints mechanism has led to a limited jurisprudence on the interpretation and implementation of the Convention. As at September 2011, 48 complaints have been registered with the Committee; 17 of these have been deemed inadmissible, 16 have led to a finding of no violation, and in 11 cases a party has been found to have violated the Convention. Three cases were still pending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SELECTED DECISIONS OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE ELIMINATION OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION |url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/CERDSelectedDecisionsVolume1.pdf |publisher=UN CERD |date=2012|access-date=2018-08-08}} page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Several cases have dealt with the treatment of [[Romani people]] in Eastern Europe. In ''Koptova v. Slovakia'' the Committee found that resolutions by several villages in [[Slovakia]] forbidding the residence of Roma were discriminatory and restricted [[freedom of movement]] and residence, and recommended the Slovak government take steps to end such practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/464937c637ce5c0ec12569d20033a961?Opendocument |title=Communication No 13/1998 : Koptova v.

Slovakia'' the Committee found that the Slovak government had failed to provide an effective remedy for discrimination suffered by Roma after the cancellation of a housing project on ethnic grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Communication No. 31/2003 : L.R. v. Slovakia. 10/03/2005. |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/3764f57be14718c6c1256fc400579258?Opendocument |publisher=UN CERD |date=10 March 2005 |access-date=2009-10-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727052945/http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/%28Symbol%29/3764f57be14718c6c1256fc400579258?Opendocument |archive-date=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Durmic v. Serbia and Montenegro'' the Committee found a systemic failure by the Serbian government to investigate and prosecute discrimination against Roma in access to public places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bayefsky.com/pdf/serbia_t5_cerd_29_2003.pdf |title=Durmic v. Serbia and Montenegro |publisher=UN CERD |date=6 March 2006 |access-date=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several cases, notably ''L.K. v. Netherlands'' and ''Gelle v. Denmark'', the Committee has criticized parties for their failure to adequately prosecute acts of racial discrimination or incitement. In both cases, the Committee refused to accept "any claim that the enactment of law making racial discrimination a criminal act in itself represents full compliance with the obligations of States parties under the Convention".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/ec0884e5a47c1a1480256714005f6000?Opendocument |title=Communication No 4/1991 : L.K. v.

Netherlands, para. 6.5&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[The Jewish community of Oslo et al. v. Norway]], the Committee found that the prohibition of hate speech was compatible with freedom of speech, and that the acquittal of a neo-Nazi leader by the [[Supreme Court of Norway]] on freedom of speech grounds was a violation of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/country/decisions/30-2003.html |title=The Jewish community of Oslo et al. v. Norway, Communication No. 30/2003, U.N. Doc. CERD/C/67/D/30/2003 (2005) |publisher=UN CERD |date=15 August 2005 |access-date=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Hagan v. Australia'', the Committee ruled that, while not originally intended to demean anyone, the name of the "E. S. 'Nigger' Brown Stand" (named in honour of 1920s [[rugby league]] player [[Edward Stanley Brown]]) at a [[Toowoomba, Queensland|Toowoomba]] sports field was racially offensive and should be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bayefsky.com/html/australia_t5_cerd_26_2002.php |title=Hagan v. Australia |publisher=UN CERD |date=20 March 2003 |access-date=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===At the ICJ===
[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] won a judgment for a [[provisional measure of protection]] at [[List of International Court of Justice cases|the ICJ]] over the [[Russian Federation]] in the case of [[Russo-Georgian War]].

== Impact ==
The impact of an international treaty can be measured in two ways: by its acceptance, and by its implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lérner|1980|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heyns |first1=Christof |last2=Viljoen |first2=Frans |title=The Impact of the United Nations Human Rights Treaties on the Domestic Level |journal=Human Rights Quarterly |volume=23 |pages=483–535 |year=2001 |issue=3 |doi=10.1353/hrq.2001.0036|s2cid=144831485 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the first measure, the Convention has gained near-universal acceptance by the international community, with fewer than twenty (mostly small) states yet to become parties.&lt;ref name=UNTC-CERD/&gt; Most major states have also accepted the Convention's individual complaints mechanism, signaling a strong desire to be bound by the Convention's provisions.&lt;ref name=UNTC-CERD/&gt;
&lt;!--
On the second measure, the Convention has had a significant impact on national legislation, with many states adopting legislation outlawing racial discrimination by the state, in the workplace, or in the provision of services such as housing and education. Such legislation may be either civil or criminal.&lt;ref name=ho238&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/hors238.pdf |title=Home Office Research Study 238: Tackling racial equality: international comparisons |author=Mary Coussey |publisher=UK Home Office |page=10 |date=April 2002 |access-date=2009-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211095718/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/hors238.pdf |archive-date=11 February 2006 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the former include the [[Civil Rights Act 1964]] (United States), Race Relations Act 1971 (New Zealand), [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]] (Australia), [[Race Relations Act 1976]] (UK), and [[Canadian Human Rights Act|Canadian Human Rights Act 1977]] (Canada). Criminal provisions are used in Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Norway and Portugal.&lt;ref name=ho238/&gt; Despite reservations to the Convention, most western European nations have criminalized the incitement of racial hatred.&lt;ref name=ho238/&gt;
--&gt;
The Convention has faced persistent problems with reporting since its inception, with parties frequently failing to report fully,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/5786c74b85372739c12563ee003d8c89?Opendocument |title=CERD General Recommendation No. 04: Demographic composition of the population |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=25 August 1973 |access-date=2009-11-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912001007/http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/%28Symbol%29/5786c74b85372739c12563ee003d8c89?Opendocument |archive-date=12 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/9aea5ab9c02d7132c12563ee003e44a4?Opendocument |title=CERD General Recommendation No. 06: Overdue reports |publisher=UN OHCHR |date=19 March 1982 |access-date=2009-11-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912001044/http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/%28Symbol%29/9aea5ab9c02d7132c12563ee003e44a4?Opendocument |archive-date=12 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, twenty parties had failed to report for more than ten years, and thirty parties had failed to report for more than five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G08/449/20/PDF/G0844920.pdf?OpenElement |title=Report of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination Seventy-second session (18 February-7 March 2008) and Seventy-third session (28 July-15 August 2008) (A/63/18) |publisher=UN General Assembly |year=2008 |access-date=2009-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728154520/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G08/449/20/PDF/G0844920.pdf?OpenElement |archive-date=28 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; One party, [[Sierra Leone]], had failed to report since 1976, while two more – [[Liberia]] and [[Saint Lucia]] had never met their reporting requirements under the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination'', p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee has responded to this persistent failure to report by reviewing the late parties anyway – a strategy that has produced some success in gaining compliance with reporting requirements.&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination'', pp. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of reporting is seen by some as a significant failure of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Felice |first=William F.  |title=The UN Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination: Race, and Economic and Social Human Rights |journal=Human Rights Quarterly |volume=24 |pages=205–236 |year=2002 |doi=10.1353/hrq.2002.0009|s2cid=144709783 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However the reporting system has also been praised as providing "a permanent stimulus inducing individual States to enact anti-racist legislation or amend the existing one when necessary."&lt;ref name=Lerner2&gt;{{cite book |title=Group rights and discrimination in international law |edition=2nd |last=Lérner |first=Natán |publisher=Kluwer Law International |location=The Hague |page=71 |year=2003 |isbn=90-411-1982-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination{{anchor|CERD}} ==
The '''Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination''' is a body of human rights experts tasked with monitoring the implementation of the Convention. It consists of 18 independent human rights experts, elected for four-year terms, with half the members elected every two years. Members are elected by secret ballot of the parties, with each party allowed to nominate one of its nationals to the Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All parties are required to submit regular reports to the Committee outlining the legislative, judicial, policy and other measures they have taken to give effect to the Convention. The first report is due within a year of the Convention entering into effect for that state; thereafter reports are due every two years or whenever the Committee requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICERD|loc=Article 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the state party in the form of "concluding observations".

On 10 August 2018, United Nations human rights experts expressed alarm over many credible reports that [[China]] had detained a million or more ethnic [[Uyghurs]] in [[Xinjiang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/10/world/asia/china-xinjiang-un-uighurs.html|title=U.N.

On 13 August 2019, the Committee considered the first report submitted by the Palestinian Authority. A number of experts questioned the delegation regarding [[antisemitism]], particularly in textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/world/un-anti-racism-panel-palestinians-school-book-hate|title=UN anti-racism panel challenges Palestinians on alleged 'schoolbook hate'|last=Kaplan|first=Talia|date=2019-08-14|website=Fox News|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silvio José Albuquerque e Silva (Brazil) also raised evidence of discrimination against Roma and other minorities, the status of women, and oppression of the LGBT community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Palestinians-revive-charge-Zionism-is-racism-at-UN-hearing-598598|title=Palestinians revive charge Zionism is racism at U.N. hearing – Arab-Israeli Conflict – Jerusalem Post|website=www.jpost.com|access-date=2019-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee's report&lt;ref&gt;Report on the Palestinian Authority by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial [https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CERD/Shared%20Documents/PSE/CERD_C_PSE_CO_1-2_36938_E.pdf Discrimination] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190922150723/https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CERD/Shared%2520Documents/PSE/CERD_C_PSE_CO_1-2_36938_E.pdf |date=22 September 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of 30 August 2019 reflected these concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-first-un-panel-calls-on-palestinians-to-halt-hate-speech-against-israelis/|title=In first, UN panel calls on Palestinians to halt hate speech against Israelis|last=staff|first=T.

On 23 April 2018 Palestine filed an inter-state complaint against Israel for breaches of its obligations under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://embassies.gov.il/UnGeneva/NewsAndEvents/MediaStatements/Pages/20180504-Israel-reacts-to-the-CERD-Committee-statement.aspx|title=Israel reacts to the CERD Committee's statement|date=14 May 2018|publisher=Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs|access-date=26 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lazaroff|first=Tovah|url=https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/palestinians-revive-charge-zionism-is-racism-at-un-hearing-598598|title=Palestinians revive charge Zionism is racism at U.N. hearing|date=15 August 2019|work=The Jerusalem Post|access-date=19 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 and 5 December 2019, the Committee considered the report submitted by Israel and in its conclusions of 12 December&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CERD/Shared%20Documents/ISR/INT_CERD_COC_ISR_40809_E.pdf|title=Concluding observations on the combined seventeenth to nineteenth reports of Israel|date=12 December 2019|website=CERD|access-date=26 December 2019|archive-date=2 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200102015445/https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CERD/Shared%2520Documents/ISR/INT_CERD_COC_ISR_40809_E.pdf|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that it is worried about "existing discriminatory legislation, the segregation of Israeli society into Jewish and non-Jewish sectors" and other complaints." The Committee also decided that it has jurisdiction regarding the inter-State communication submitted by the State of Palestine on 23 April 2018 against the State of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25429&amp;LangID=E|title=UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination publishes findings on Cambodia, Colombia, Ireland, Israel and Uzbekistan|date=13 December 2019|website=UN OHCHR|access-date=26 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded by alleging bias by the committee members, noting that their "blatant anti-Israel posture, and reckless disregard for the welfare of Israelis, is a shocking neglect of the duties of the CERD Committee to act with impartiality and objectivity."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Committee typically meets every March and August in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/sessions.htm |title=Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination – Sessions |access-date=2008-06-03 |publisher=UN OHCHR |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517091901/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/sessions.htm |archive-date=17 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current ({{As of|2023|07|lc=y}}) membership of the Committee is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/cerd/pages/membership.aspx|title=Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination – Membership|publisher=UN OHCHR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opposition ==

===In Malaysia===
On 8 December 2018, two of Malaysia's major [[right wing]] political parties – the Islamist [[Malaysian Islamic Party]] and the ethnonationalist [[United Malays National Organisation]] – organized a "[[2018_anti-ICERD_rally|Anti-ICERD Peaceful Rally]]" with the support of several non-government organizations on fears of the convention allegedly compromising [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|bumiputera]] privileges and [[ketuanan Melayu|special positions of the Malay people]] and Islam in the country,&lt;ref name="PAS ICERD"&gt;{{cite web|title=ICERD-Memperkenalkan Siapa Dirinya|url=https://berita.pas.org.my/icerd-memperkenalkan-siapa-dirinya/|website=PAS Parti Islam Se Malaysia|publisher=PAS|access-date=22 Dec 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; a major tenet held by both these parties.
