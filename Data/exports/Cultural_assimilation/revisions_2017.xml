'''Cultural assimilation''' is the process by which a person's or group's culture come to resemble those of another group. It is like two very similar religions (usually not the same). The term is used to refer to both individuals and groups; the latter case can refer to either foreign [[immigrant]]s or native residents that come to be culturally dominated by another society.

Cultural assimilation may involve either a quick or gradual change depending on circumstances of the group. Full assimilation occurs when new members of a society become indistinguishable from members of the other group.  Whether it is desirable for an immigrant group to assimilate is often disputed by both members of the group and those of the dominant society. Cultural assimilation does not guarantee social homophily though as this article states, geographical and other natural barriers between cultures even if started by the same dominant culture will be culturally different.&lt;ref&gt;Parisi, Domenico, Federico Cecconi, and Francesco Natale. "Cultural change in spatial environments: the role of cultural assimilation and internal changes in cultures." ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'' 47.2 (2003): 163–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
A place (a state or an ethnicity) can spontaneously adopt a different culture due to its political relevance,  or to its perceived superiority. The first is the case of the [[Latin|Latin language]] and culture, that were gradually adopted by most of the subjugated people.

Cultural assimilation can happen either spontaneously or forcibly. A culture can spontaneously adopt a different culture or older and richer cultures forcibly integrate other weak cultures. The term assimilation is often used with regard to immigrants and various ethnic groups who have settled in a new land. A new culture and new attitudes toward the origin culture are obtained through contact and communication. [[culture change|Cultural changing]] is not simply a one-way process. Assimilation assumes that relatively tenuous culture gets to be united to one unified culture. This process happens through contact and accommodation between each culture. The current definition of assimilation is usually used to refer to immigrants, but in [[multiculturalism]], cultural assimilation can happen all over the world, not just be limited to specific areas. For example, a shared language gives people the chance to study and work internationally, not just being limited to the same cultural group. People from different countries contribute to diversity and form the "global culture" which means the culture combined by the elements from different countries. This "global culture" can be seen as a part of assimilation that causes cultures from different areas to affect each other.

== Assimilation by country ==
Immigrant assimilation is a complex process in which immigrants not only fully integrate themselves into a new country, but also lose aspects, perhaps all of their heritage too. Social scientists rely on four primary benchmarks to assess immigrant assimilation: [[socioeconomic status]], geographic distribution, [[second language]] attainment, and [[Exogamy|intermarriage]].&lt;ref name="Waters" /&gt;  William A.V. Clark defines immigrant assimilation as "a way of understanding the social dynamics of American society and that it is the process that occurs spontaneously and often unintended in the course of interaction between majority and [[minority groups]]".&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Clark |first=W. |year=2003 |title=Immigrants and the American Dream: Remaking the Middle Class |location=New York |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=1-57230-880-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States===
{{Further information|Americanization (immigration)}}

Between 1880 and 1920, the United States took in roughly 24 million immigrants.&lt;ref name="Waters"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Waters |first=Mary C. |last2=Jiménez |first2=Tomás R. |title=Assessing Immigrant Assimilation: New Empirical and Theoretical Challenges |journal=[[Annual Review of Sociology]] |volume=31 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=105–125 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This increase in immigration can be attributed to many historical changes. The beginning of the twenty-first century has also marked a massive era of immigration, and sociologists are once again trying to make sense of the impact that immigration has on society and the impact it has on immigrants themselves.&lt;ref name="Waters"/&gt;

Assimilation had various meanings in American sociology, [[Henry Pratt Fairchild]] associates American assimilation with Americanization or the ''melting pot'' theory. Some scholars also believed assimilation and acculturation were synonymous. According to a many's point of view, assimilation is a "process of interpretation and fusion" from another group or person. This may include memories, behaviors and sentiments. By sharing their experiences and histories, they blend into the common cultural life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/earth-and-environment/ecology-and-environmentalism/environmental-studies/assimilation|title=Assimilation facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Assimilation|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long history of immigration in these established gateways means that the place of immigrants in terms of [[Social class|class]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]], and [[ethnic]] hierarchies in these traditional gateways are more structured or established on the other hand these new gateways do not have much immigration [[history]] therefore the place of immigrants in terms of class, racial, and ethnic hierarchies is less defined and immigrants may have more influence to define their position. Secondly, the size of new gateways may influence immigrant assimilation. Having a smaller gateway may influence the level of [[Racial segregation|segregation]] among immigrants and native-born people. Thirdly, the difference in institutional arrangements may influence immigrant assimilation. Traditional gateways, unlike new gateways, have many institutions set up to help immigrants such as legal aid, bureaus, social organizations. Finally, Waters and Jimenez have only speculated that these differences may influence immigrant assimilation and the way researchers should assess immigrant assimilation.&lt;ref name="Waters"/&gt;
