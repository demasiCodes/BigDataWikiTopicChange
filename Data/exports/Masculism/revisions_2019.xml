==Terminology==
===Early history===
According to the historian Judith Allen, [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] coined the term ''masculism'' in 1914,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Judith A.|title=The Feminism of Charlotte Perkins Gilman: Sexualities, Histories, Progressivism|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|year=2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=oMstMHT-n2YC&amp;pg=PA353 353]|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; when she gave a public lecture series in New York entitled "Studies in Masculism". Apparently the printer did not like the term and tried to change it. Allen writes that Gilman used ''masculism'' to refer to the opposition of [[Misogyny|misogynist]] men to women's rights and, more broadly, to describe "men's collective political and cultural actions on behalf of their own sex",{{sfn|Allen|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=oMstMHT-n2YC&amp;pg=PA152 152]}} or what Allen calls the "sexual politics of [[Androcentrism|androcentric]] cultural discourses".{{sfn|Allen|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=oMstMHT-n2YC&amp;pg=PA353 353]}} Gilman referred to men and women who opposed [[women's suffrage]] as masculists—women who collaborated with these men were "Women Who Won't Move Forward"{{sfn|Allen|2009|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=oMstMHT-n2YC&amp;pg=PA136 136–137]}}—and described [[World War I]] as "masculism at its worst".{{sfn|Allen|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=oMstMHT-n2YC&amp;pg=PA127 127]}}{{Single Source-inline|reason=Other sources indicate the word existed prior to this date.|date=May 2019}}

In response to the lecture, W. H. Sampson wrote in a letter to the ''New York Times'' that women must share the blame for war: "It is perfectly useless to pretend that men have fought, struggled and labored for themselves, while women have stayed at home, wishing they wouldn't, praying before the shrines for peace, and using every atom of their influence to bring about a holy calm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sampson |first1=W. H. |title=Not All Man's Fault |work=The New York Times |date=3 April 1914 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leary |first=Andrea M. |year=2005 |title=Charlotte Perkins Gilman as a Master of Audience: Newspaper Reviewers Expose a Radical Lecturer |work=Resources for American Literary Study |pages=(216–235), 224 |jstor=26366994}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{relevance inline|date=May 2019}}

=== Definition and scope ===
{{Off topic|date=May 2019|Masculinism}}
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2000) defines ''masculinism'', and [[synonym]]ously ''masculism'', as: "Advocacy of the rights of men; adherence to or promotion of opinions, values, etc., regarded as typical of men; (more generally) anti-feminism, machismo."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=masculinism, n|work=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=3rd |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The OED offers a second, obsolete, definition of ''masculism'': "masculism, n. †1. The possession of masculine physical traits by a woman. Obselete. rare. Apparently an isolated use, completely superseded by masculinization (see n. 2). 2. masculinism n."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=masculism, n|work=Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=3rd |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} According to Susan Whitlow in ''The Encyclopedia of Literary and Cultural Theory'' (2011), the terms are "used interchangeably across disciplines".&lt;ref name="Whitlow 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Whitlow |first=Susan |chapter=Gender and Cultural Studies |title=The Encyclopedia of Literary and Cultural Theory, Volume 3 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Malden, Mass. |date=2011 |doi=10.1002/9781444337839.wbelctv3g003 |isbn=978-1-40-518312-3 |pages=1083–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sociologist Robert Menzies wrote in 2007 that both terms are common in [[men's rights]] and [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]] literature: "The intrepid virtual adventurer who boldly goes into these unabashedly mascul(in)ist spaces is quickly rewarded with a torrent of diatribes, invectives, atrocity tales, claims to entitlement, calls to arms, and prescriptions for change in the service of men, children, families, God, the past, the future, the nation, the planet, and all other things non-feminist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Menzies |first1=Robert |editor1-last=Chunn |editor1-first=Dorothy E. |editor2-last=Boyd |editor2-first=Susan |editor3-last=Lessard |editor3-first=Hester |title=Reaction and Resistance: Feminism, Law, and Social Change |date=2007 |publisher=University of British Columbia Press |location=Vancouver |pages=65, 91, note 2 |chapter=Virtual Backlash: Representations of Men's 'Rights' and Feminist 'Wrongs' in Cyberspace|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gender-studies scholar [[Julia Wood]] describes ''masculinism'' as an ideology asserting that women and men should have different roles and rights owing to fundamental differences between them, and that men suffer from discrimination and "need to reclaim their rightful status as men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wood |first1=Julia T. |title=Gendered Lives: Communication, Gender, &amp; Culture |date=2014 |publisher=Cengage Learning |location=Stamford, Conn. |isbn=978-1-28-507593-8 |page=89 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Gendered_Lives.html?id=vMoTCgAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22masculinist+men's+groups%22 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists Arthur Brittan and Satoshi Ikeda describe masculinism as an ideology justifying male domination in society.{{efn|Brittan calls masculinism "the ideology that justifies and naturalizes male domination&amp;nbsp;... the ideology of patriarchy".{{refn|name=Brittan}}}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ikeda |first1=Satoshi |editor1-last=Griffin-Cohen |editor1-first=M. |editor2-last=Brodie |editor2-first=J. |title=Remapping Gender in the New Global Order |date=2007 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-41-576997-3 |page=112 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Remapping_Gender_in_the_New_Global_Order.html?id=GV-SAgAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22masculinism+the+ideology+that+justifies+male+domination%22 |ref=harv |chapter=Masculinity and masculinism under globalization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masculinism, according to Brittan, maintains that there is "a fundamental difference" between men and women and rejects feminist arguments that male–female relationships are political constructs.&lt;ref name="Brittan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brittan |first=Arthur |title=Masculinity and Power |url=https://archive.org/details/masculinitypower00arth |url-access=registration |date=1989 |publisher=Basil Blackwell |location=Oxford |page=[https://archive.org/details/masculinitypower00arth/page/4 4] |isbn=0-63-114167-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ferrel Christensen, a Canadian philosopher and president of the former Alberta-based Movement for the Establishment of Real Gender Equality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thorne |first1=Duncan |title=Gender bias in pamphlet, says human rights officer |url=https://www.fact.on.ca/news/news0006/ej000620.htm |work=The Edmonton Journal |date=20 June 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010228064228/https://www.fact.on.ca/news/news0006/ej000620.htm |archivedate=28 February 2001|url-status=live}}; {{harvnb|Menzies|2007|p=91, note 7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Defining 'masculism' is made difficult by the fact that the term has been used by very few people, and by hardly any philosophers." He differentiates between "progressive masculists", who welcome many of the societal changes promoted by feminists, while believing that some measures to reduce sexism against women have increased it against men, and an "extremist version" of masculism that promotes male supremacy. He argued that if masculism and feminism refer to the belief that men/women are systematically discriminated against, and that this discrimination should be eliminated, there is not necessarily a conflict between feminism and masculism, and some assert that they are both. However, many believe that one sex is more discriminated against, and thus use one label and reject the other.&lt;ref name=OCP/&gt;

The political scientist Georgia Duerst-Lahti distinguishes between ''masculism'', which expresses the ethos of the early gender-egalitarian [[men's movement]], and ''masculinism'', which refers to the ideology of [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Duerst-Lahti | first = Georgia | contribution = Gender Ideology: masculinism and femininalism |pages=159&amp;ndash;192 |editor1-last=Goertz |editor1-first=Gary |editor2-last=Mazur |editor2-first=Amy G. |title=Politics, gender, and concepts: theory and methodology |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521723428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dupuis-Déri2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dupuis-Déri|first1=Francis|title=Le 'masculinisme': une histoire politique du mot (en Anglais et en Français)| trans-title = 'Masculinism': a political history of the term (in English and French) |journal=Recherches Féministes |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=97&amp;ndash;123 |date=2009 |doi=10.7202/039213ar | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists Melissa Blais and Francis Dupuis-Déri equate ''masculist'' and ''masculinist'', attributing the former to author [[Warren Farrell]]. The most common term, they argue, is the "men's movement"; they write that there is a growing consensus in the French-language media that the movement should be referred to as ''masculiniste''.{{sfn|Blais|Dupuis-Déri|2012|pp=22–23}} According to Whitlow, masculinist theory such as Farrell's and that of gender-studies scholar [[R.W. Connell]] developed alongside [[third-wave feminism]] and [[queer theory]], and was influenced by those theories' questioning of traditional [[gender role]]s and the meaning of terms such as ''man'' and ''woman''.{{refn|name=Whitlow 2010}}

According to Bethany M. Coston and [[Michael Kimmel]], members of the [[mythopoetic men's movement]] identify as masculinist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coston |first1=Bethany M. |last2=Kimmel |first2=Michael |authorlink2=Michael Kimmel |title=White Men as the New Victims: Reverse Discrimination Cases and the Men's Rights Movement |journal=Nevada Law Journal |date=2013 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=(368–385), 371 |url=https://scholars.law.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1465&amp;context=nlj}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas Davidson, in ''The Failure of Feminism'' (1988),  calls ''masculism'' "virism": "Where the feminist perspective is that social ills are caused by the dominance of masculine values, the virist perspective is that they are caused by a decline of those values.&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Davidson | first = Nicholas | title = The Failure of Feminism |pages=274–275 | publisher = Prometheus Books | location = Buffalo, NY | year = 1988 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=pf8pAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA274 | isbn = 9780879754082 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christensen calls virism "an extreme brand of masculism and masculinism".&lt;ref name=OCP/&gt;

==Areas of interest==
===Education and employment===
{{See also|Sex differences in education}}

Many masculists oppose co-educational schooling, believing that single-sex schools better promote the well-being of boys.{{sfn|Blais|Dupuis-Déri|2012|p=23}}

Data from the U.S. in 1994 reported that men suffer 94% of workplace fatalities. Farrell has argued that men do a disproportionate share of dirty, physically demanding, and hazardous jobs.&lt;ref name=reason/&gt;

===Violence and suicide===
{{Violence against men}}
{{See also|Violence against men}}

Masculists cite higher rates of suicide in men than women.{{sfn|Blais|Dupuis-Déri|2012|p=23}} Farrell expresses concern about violence against men being depicted as humorous, in the media and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=MYTH&gt;{{cite book | last = Farrell | first = Warren | author-link = Warren Farrell | title = The myth of male power: why men are the disposable sex | publisher = [[Berkley Books]] | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780425181447 | title-link = The Myth of Male Power }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also express concern about violence against men being ignored or minimized in comparison to violence against women,{{sfn|Blais|Dupuis-Déri|2012|p=23}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Mvulane | first = Zama | title = Do men suffer spousal abuse? | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090221033948/http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=13&amp;art_id=vn20081125064002133C731559&amp;set_id= | archive-date = February 21, 2009 | url = http://www.iol.co.za:80/index.php?click_id=13&amp;art_id=vn20081125064002133C731559&amp;set_id= | work = [[Cape Times]] | via = [[Independent Online (South Africa)|IOL]] | location = South Africa | page = 12 | date = November 25, 2008 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; asserting gender symmetry in [[domestic violence]].{{sfn|Blais|Dupuis-Déri|2012|p=23}} Another of Farrell's concerns is that traditional assumptions of female innocence or sympathy for women, termed [[benevolent sexism]], may lead to unequal penalties for women and men who commit similar crimes,&lt;ref name="MYTH" /&gt; to lack of sympathy for male victims in [[domestic violence]] cases when the perpetrator is female, and to dismissal of female-on-male [[sexual assault]] and [[sexual harassment]] cases.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

===Gender studies ===
{{See also|Men's studies}}
A masculist approach to [[gender studies]], which have frequently focused on woman-based or feminist approaches, examines oppression within a masculinist, patriarchal society from a male standpoint.&lt;ref name="HoogensenSolheim2006"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hoogensen |first1=Gunhild |last2=Solheim |first2=Bruce O. |title=Women in Power: World Leaders Since 1960 |publisher=[[Praeger Publishers]] |year=2006 |isbn=0-275-98190-8 |page=21 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZPThCTMVsZQC&amp;q=masculism+masculinist+masculinism |lccn=2006015398 |chapter=2.

== South African masculinist evangelical movements ==
In the wake of the abolition of [[apartheid]], South Africa saw a resurgence of masculinist Christian evangelical groups, led by the [[Mighty Men Conference]] and a complementary Worthy Women Conference. The latter saw the development of "for''men''ism": "For''men''ism, like masculinism, subscribes to a belief in the inherent superiority of men over women (in other words, only men can be leaders), but unlike masculinism, it not an ideology developed and sustained by men, but one constructed, endorsed and sustained by ''women''."&lt;ref name="Nadar_Potgieter"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nadar | first1 = Sarojini | last2 = Potgieter | first2 = Cheryl | title = Liberated through submission?: The Worthy Woman's Conference as a case study of for''men''ism | journal = Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = (141&amp;ndash;151), 143 | date = Fall 2010 | url = https://muse.jhu.edu/article/394797 | ref = harv | doi = 10.2979/fsr.2010.26.2.141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mighty Men movement harkens back to the Victorian idea of [[Muscular Christianity]].

"[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yMTSCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61 Mighty Men, Mighty Families: A pro-family Christian movement to (re)enforce patriarchal control?]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Conradie | editor-first1 = Ernst M. | editor-last2=Pillay| editor-first2=Miranda| title = Ecclesial reform and deform movements in the South African context | pages = 61&amp;ndash;77 | publisher = African SUN MeDIA | location = Stellenbosch, South Africa | isbn = 9781920689766| date = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Worthy Women movement is an auxiliary to Mighty Men in advocating ''men''ism, a belief in the inherent superiority of men over women.&lt;ref name="Nadar_Potgieter" /&gt; Their leader, Gretha Wiid, blames South Africa's disorder on the liberation of women, and aims to restore the nation through its families, making women again subservient to men.&lt;ref&gt;Nortjé-Meyer, Lilly (2015).
