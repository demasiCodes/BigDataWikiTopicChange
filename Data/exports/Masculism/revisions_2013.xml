'''Masculism''' or '''masculinism''' or '''virism''' may variously refer to advocacy of the rights or needs of men; the adherence to or promotion of opinions, values, attitudes, etc. regarded as typical of men;&lt;ref name="BunninYu2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Christensen|first=Ferrell|editor=Ted Honderich|title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4ii8AAAAIAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-866132-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reason&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[Reason magazine|Reason]]''|title=Man Troubles: Making Sense of the Men's Movement|author=[[Cathy Young]]|date=July 1994|url=http://law-journals-books.vlex.com/vid/man-troubles-making-sense-men-movement-53432494/ai_16075316/}} "Not to worry" there seems to imply that this conception of masculism poses a threat to women, or to the women's movement. A broader conception of the women's movement, however, recognizes that patriarchy is harmful to both men and women, and therefore that prejudice and discrimination against both genders will need to be recognized and redressed.&lt;/ref&gt; or, alternatively, an approach that is focused on [[Androcentrism|male superiority]]&lt;ref name="Masculinist"&gt;{{cite web|title=masculinist, n|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/masculinist|work=Merriam-Webster|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brittan1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Brittan|title=Masculinity and Power|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ptFzQgAACAAJ&amp;pg=PA91|accessdate=11 May 2013|year= 1989|publisher= Wiley|isbn= 978-0-631-14167-9|page= 4|quote= Masculinism is the ideology that justifies and naturalizes male domination.

==Definition and scope==
The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] regards it as: "Advocacy of the rights of men; adherence to or promotion of opinions, values, etc., regarded as typical of men; (more generally) anti-feminism, machismo."&lt;ref name="oedMasculinism"&gt;{{cite web|title=masculinism, n|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00302767|work=Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the terms masculism, men's rights and masculinism may be used interchangeably,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} philosopher Ferrell Christensen differentiates the words "masculism" and "masculinism"; he defines the latter as promoting the attributes of manliness.&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt;
Political scientist Georgia Duerst-Lahti also distinguishes between the two terms, with masculism being more associated with the early gender egalitarian days of [[men's movement]], while masculinism refers to [[patriarchy]] and its ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | editor = Goertz, Gary |  editor2 = Mazur, Amy | first2 = Amy. | title = Politics, gender, and concepts : theory and methodology | year = 2008 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | chapter= Gender Ideology:masculinism and femininalism |author=Georgia Duerst-Lahti | isbn = 978-0-521-72342-8 | pages = 159–192 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dupuis-Déri2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dupuis-Déri|first1=Francis|title=Le " masculinisme " : une histoire politique du mot (en anglais et en français)|journal=Recherches féministes|volume=22|issue=2|year=2009|pages=97|issn=0838-4479|doi=10.7202/039213ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christensen differentiates between "progressive masculism" and an "extremist version". The former welcomes many of the societal changes promoted by feminists, while stating that many aimed at reducing sexism against women have had the effect of increasing it against men.&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt; The latter promotes male supremacy to some degree and is generally based on a belief in women's inferiority. Nicholas Davidson, in his book "The Failure of Feminism" describes an extremist version of masculism which he termed "virism". According to Davidson, in this view "What ails society is 'effeminacy'. The improvement of society requires that the influence of female values be decreased and the influence of male values increased…."&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davidson1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas Davidson|title=The failure of feminism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pf8pAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA274|year=1988|publisher=Prometheus Books, Publishers|isbn=978-0-87975-408-2|pages=274–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gender theory|Gender theories]], which have frequently focussed on woman-based or feminist approaches,  have come to include a "masculism" approach which seeks to examine oppression in a masculinist society from the perspectives of men, most of whom do not benefit from that society.&lt;ref name="HoogensenSolheim2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gunhild Hoogensen|author2=Bruce Olav Solheim|title=Women in power: world leaders since 1960|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZPThCTMVsZQC&amp;pg=PA21|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-98190-7|pages=21–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From a feminist perspective to philosophy, masculinism seeks to value and include only male views, and claim "that anything that cannot be reduced or translated in men's experience should be excluded from the subject-matter of philosophy."&lt;ref name="BunninYu2008"/&gt;

==Discrimination against men==

===Education===
Many masculists suggest the abolition of co-educational schooling, believing that single-sex schools are preferred for the well-being of boys.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt;
Some studies have indicated that because boys attract more teacher attention in classrooms compared to girls, boys also receive harsher forms of punishment as well as more frequent punishment than girls for the same offenses.&lt;ref name=reason/&gt; Men earn only 72 bachelors degrees for every 100 women earn.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=72 Degrees conferred by sex and race]", National Center for Education Statistics, Education Demographics May 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment===
Data from 1994 in the U.S. reported that 94% of workplace fatalities occur to men. Masculist Warren Farrell has argued that men are often clustered in dirty, physically demanding and hazardous jobs in an unjustifiably disproportionate manner.&lt;ref name=reason/&gt; The [[male unemployment]] rate is 7% higher than the female unemployment rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deptofnumbers.com/unemployment/demographics/], Department of Numbers, Unemployment Demographics May 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence===
{{Violence against men}}
Masculists express concern about violence against men being depicted as humorous, in the media and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=MYTH&gt;Warren Farrell, ''The Myth of Male Power: Why Men Are the Disposable Sex'' (NY: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1993; ISBN 0-671-79349-7).&lt;/ref&gt; One prominent example addressed by the masculist men's rights movement was the [[Boys are stupid, throw rocks at them! controversy|Boys are stupid, throw rocks at them!]] controversy. In December 2003, radio host and masculist men's rights activist Glenn Sacks started a campaign against [[Todd Goldman]]'s "Boys are stupid, throw rocks at them!" T-shirts, on the grounds of [[misandry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = D | last = Crary | url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2001847133_stupidboys30.html | title = 'Stores pull "Boys Are Stupid" merchandise' | work = [[The Seattle Times]] | date = 2004-01-30 | accessdate = 2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign against the line received support from several masculist groups, such as the [[National Coalition of Free Men]], but also from groups with broader agendas, such as the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = D | last = Williams | url = http://www.tolerance.org/news/article_tol.jsp?id=929 | title = Clothing Designer Misses Point of 'Girl Power' | publisher = [[Southern Poverty Law Center|Tolerance.org]] | date = 2004-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Masculists also express concern about violence against men being ignored, minimalized or taken less seriously than violence against women.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=13&amp;art_id=vn20081125064002133C731559&amp;set_id= iol.co.za]&lt;/ref&gt; They assert that there is gender asymmetry in  [[domestic violence]],&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Another concern expressed is that assumptions of female innocence or sympathy for women may result in disproportionate penalties for women and men for similar crimes,&lt;ref name="MYTH" /&gt; lack of sympathy for male victims in [[domestic violence]] cases, and dismissal of female-on-male [[sexual assault]] and [[sexual harassment]] cases.

===Custody===
{{main|Fathers' rights movement}}
"Custody law is perhaps the best-known area of men's rights activism", as it is more common for the mother to obtain custody of children in case of divorce. [[David Benatar]], head of philosophy at the [[University of Cape Town]], argues: "When the man is the primary care-giver his chances of winning custody are lower than when the woman is the primary care-giver. Even when the case is not contested by the mother, he's still not as likely to get custody as when the woman's claim is uncontested".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17907534 "Just who are men's rights activists?"], BBC, 2 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suicide===
Masculinists point out the high rates of suicide in men.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; In fact, according to the [[National Institute of Mental Health]], in the US men die from committing suicide almost 4 times as much compared to women.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/suicide-in-the-us-statistics-and-prevention/index.shtml#risk. NIMH, 11/12/2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==

===Feminism===
Feminists respond to the different ideologies of masculism in different ways. Masculists who promote gender equality are often considered [[male feminism|male feminists]].&lt;ref&gt;Janet M. Martin and Maryanne Borrelli, ''Other Elites: Women, Politics, &amp; Power in the Executive Branch'' (Lynne Rienner Publishers, 2000; ISBN 1-55587-971-3, ISBN 978-1-55587-971-6).&lt;/ref&gt; It is the general opinion of modern [[Feminism|feminists]] that masculism, when defined as "male superiority or dominance",&lt;ref name="Masculinist"/&gt; is inherently opposed to the equality cause and is considered a form of [[misogyny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reaction and resistance: feminism, law, and social change|author1=Susan B. Boyd|author2=Dorothy E. Chunn|author3=Hester Lessard|pages=65–97|year=2007|publisher=UBC Press|ISBN=978-0-7748-1411-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Philosopher Ferrell Christensen states that if masculism and feminism refer to the belief that men/women are systematically discriminated against, and that this discrimination should be eliminated, there is not necessarily a conflict between feminism and masculism, and some assert that they are both.&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt;  However, many believe that one sex is more discriminated against, and thus use one label and reject the other.&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt;

===Criticisms and responses===

To the extent that masculism is associated with antifeminist masculinism, its primary focus is on “masculinity and the place of white heterosexual men in North America and European societies.”&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"&gt;Melissa Blais and Francis Dupuis-Déri. "Masculinism and the Antifeminist Countermovement." ''Social Movement Studies: Journal of Social, Cultural and Political Protest'' 11:1 (2012): 21-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

As previously stated, some masculinists believe that differentiated gender roles are natural. There is considerable evidence for social influences (e.g. gender division of labor, socialization) as the sole or primary origin of gender differentiation.&lt;ref name="Risman, Barbara 2004"&gt;Barbara Risman, "Gender as a Social Structure: Theory Wrestling with Activism." ''Gender &amp; Society'' 18.4 (2004): 429-450.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan A. Basow, ''Gender Stereotypes and Roles'' (Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks/Cole, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, belief in inherent gender differences allows for inequality and for the dominant group to assert power by means of perceived difference.&lt;ref name="Risman, Barbara 2004"/&gt;
The masculinist movement has to some extent appropriated the concepts of [[evolutionary psychology]]: this theory argues that adaptation during prehistory resulted in complementary but different roles for the different genders, and that this balance has been destabilized by feminism since the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt;
Despite the concern of some feminist groups towards the rights of men, some masculinist movements are explicitly antifeminist.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; According to Blais and Dupuis-Déri, “the contents of [masculinist] websites and the testimony of feminists that we questioned confirm that masculinists are generally critical of even moderate feminists and feminists at the head of official feminist organizations.”&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Masculinist activism has involved disruption of events organized by feminists and lawsuits against feminist academics, journalists, or activists.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Furthermore, masculinist actions are sometimes extreme; father’s rights activists have bombed family courts in Australia and have issued bomb threats in the UK, although it is ambiguous whether there was public and organized militant group involvement.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; They have also engaged in “tire-slashing, the mailing of excrement-filled packages, threats against politicians and their children.”&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Spokesmen for these groups have also spoken out against public awareness campaigns to prevent sexual assault, arguing that they portray a negative image of men, and one masculinist group harassed administrators of dozens of battered women’s shelters and women’s centers.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt;

===Family===

Richard Warshak, in his essay in the Family Court Review,&lt;ref name="Warshak, Richard 1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Warshak |first=Richard |year=1996 |month=July |title=Gender Bias in Child Custody Decisions |journal=Family Court Review |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=396–409 |doi=10.1111/j.174-1617.1996.tb00429.x |accessdate=3 August 2013 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.174-1617.1996.tb00429.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; was "unable to locate any study of nationwide patterns of custody adjudication.", noting that "some regional
studies" did find gender bias. He also notes that “[g]ender stereotypes [such as nurturing caretaker] that favor mothers' preferential claims to custody are not supported by research”, and goes on to argue that the focus of child custody decisions should be on the children, and not the parents.

Karen Czapansky wrote an essay on the subject in the Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics and found a comprehensive "need for reform in order to eliminate the impact of gender bias on judicial process and decisionmaking", noting that in custody decisions, gender biases can favor either men or women: “a judge may decline to consider a father a serious candidate for custody, just as he may decline to find fit for custody a divorced mother who works or one who is sexually active.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Czapanskiy |first=Karen |year=1990 |title=Gender Bias in the Courts: Social Change Strategies |journal=Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics |volume=4 |issue=1 |accessdate=3 August 2013 |url=http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1304&amp;context=fac_pubs}}&lt;/ref&gt;
