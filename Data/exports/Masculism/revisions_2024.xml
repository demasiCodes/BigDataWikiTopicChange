==Terminology==
===Early history===
According to the historian Judith Allen, [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] invented the term ''masculism'' in 1914,&lt;ref name="Allen 2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen |first=Judith A. |title=The Feminism of Charlotte Perkins Gilman: Sexualities, Histories, Progressivism |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=2009 |page=353}}&lt;/ref&gt; when she gave a public lecture series in New York entitled "Studies in Masculism". Allen writes that Gilman used ''masculism'' to refer to the opposition of [[Misogyny|misogynist]] men to women's rights and, more broadly, to describe "men's collective political and cultural actions on behalf of their own sex",{{sfn|Allen|2009|p=152}} or what Allen calls the "sexual politics of [[Androcentrism|androcentric]] cultural discourses".{{sfn|Allen|2009|p=353}} Gilman referred to men and women who opposed [[women's suffrage]] as masculists—women who collaborated with these men were "Women Who Won't Move Forward"{{sfn|Allen|2009|pp=136–137}}—and described [[World War I]] as "masculism at its worst".{{sfn|Allen|2009|p=127}}

=== Definition and scope ===
''A Dictionary of Media and Communication'' (2011) defines ''masculinism'' (or ''masculism'') as "[a] male counterpart to feminism. [...] Like feminism, masculism reflects a number of positions, from the desire for equal rights for men (for example, in cases of child access after divorce), to more militant calls for the total abolition of women's rights."{{r|Chandler 2011}} According to Susan Whitlow in ''The Encyclopedia of Literary and Cultural Theory'' (2011), the terms are "used interchangeably across disciplines".&lt;ref name="Whitlow 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Whitlow |first=Susan |chapter=Gender and Cultural Studies |title=The Encyclopedia of Literary and Cultural Theory, Volume 3 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Malden, Mass. |date=2011 |doi=10.1002/9781444337839.wbelctv3g003 |isbn=978-1-40-518312-3 |pages=1083–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sociologist Robert Menzies wrote in 2007 that both terms are common in [[men's rights]] and [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]] literature: "The intrepid virtual adventurer who boldly goes into these unabashedly mascul(in)ist spaces is quickly rewarded with a torrent of diatribes, invectives, atrocity tales, claims to entitlement, calls to arms, and prescriptions for change in the service of men, children, families, God, the past, the future, the nation, the planet, and all other things non-feminist."&lt;ref name="Menzies 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Menzies |first1=Robert |editor1-last=Chunn |editor1-first=Dorothy E. |editor2-last=Boyd |editor2-first=Susan |editor3-last=Lessard |editor3-first=Hester |title=Reaction and Resistance: Feminism, Law, and Social Change |date=2007 |publisher=University of British Columbia Press |location=Vancouver |at=p. 65; note 2, p. 91 |chapter=Virtual Backlash: Representations of Men's 'Rights' and Feminist 'Wrongs' in Cyberspace |isbn=978-0-7748-4036-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gender-studies scholar [[Julia T. Wood|Julia Wood]] describes ''masculinism'' as an ideology asserting that women and men should have different roles and rights owing to fundamental differences between them, and that men suffer from discrimination and "need to reclaim their rightful status as men".&lt;ref name="Wood 2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wood |first1=Julia T. |title=Gendered Lives: Communication, Gender, &amp; Culture |date=2014 |publisher=Cengage Learning |location=Stamford, Conn. |isbn=978-1-28-507593-8 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists Arthur Brittan and Satoshi Ikeda describe masculinism as an ideology justifying male domination in society.{{efn|Brittan calls masculinism "the ideology that justifies and naturalizes male domination&amp;nbsp;... the ideology of patriarchy".{{r|Brittan 1989}}}}&lt;ref name="Ikeda 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ikeda |first1=Satoshi |editor1-last=Griffin-Cohen |editor1-first=M. |editor2-last=Brodie |editor2-first=J. |title=Remapping Gender in the New Global Order |date=2007 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-1-1359-8897-5 |page=112 |doi=10.4324/9780203099940-13 |chapter=Masculinity and masculinism under globalization: reflections on the Canadian case}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masculinism, according to Brittan, maintains that there is "a fundamental difference" between men and women and rejects feminist arguments that male–female relationships are political constructs.&lt;ref name="Brittan 1989"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brittan |first=Arthur |title=Masculinity and Power |url=https://archive.org/details/masculinitypower00arth/page/4/mode/1up?view=theater |url-access=registration |date=1989 |publisher=Basil Blackwell |location=Oxford |page=4 |isbn=0-631-14167-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reddock&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Rhoda |last1=Reddock |title=Men as Gendered Beings: The Emergence of Masculinity Studies in the Anglophone Caribbean |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/27865342 |journal=Social and Economic Studies |date=September 2003 |issn=0037-7651 |pages=89–117 |volume=52 |issue=3|jstor=27865342 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political scientist Georgia Duerst-Lahti distinguishes between ''masculism'', which expresses the [[ethos]] of the early gender-egalitarian [[men's movement]], and ''masculinism'', which refers to the ideology of [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref name="Duerst-Lahti 2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Duerst-Lahti |first=Georgia |chapter=Gender Ideology: masculinism and femininalism |pages=159&amp;ndash;192 |editor1-last=Goertz |editor1-first=Gary |editor2-last=Mazur |editor2-first=Amy G. |title=Politics, gender, and concepts: theory and methodology |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72342-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists Melissa Blais and Francis Dupuis-Déri describe masculism as a form of [[antifeminism]];&lt;ref name="Blais 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blais |first1=Melissa |last2=Dupuis-Déri |first2=Francis |title=Masculinism and the Antifeminist Countermovement |journal=Social Movement Studies |date=January 2012 |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=21–39 |doi=10.1080/14742837.2012.640532 |s2cid=144983000}}&lt;/ref&gt; they equate ''masculist'' and ''masculinist'', attributing the former to author [[Warren Farrell]]. The most common term, they argue, is the "men's movement"; they write that there is a growing consensus in the French-language media that the movement should be referred to as ''masculiniste''.{{sfn|Blais|Dupuis-Déri|2012|pp=22–23}} Dupuis-Déri writes that members of the men's movement refer to themselves as both ''masculinist'' and ''masculist''.&lt;ref name="Dupuis-Déri 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dupuis-Déri |first1=Francis |title=Le 'masculinisme': une histoire politique du mot (en Anglais et en Français) |trans-title='Masculinism': a political history of the term (in English and French) |language=fr |journal=Recherches Féministes |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=97&amp;ndash;123 |date=2009 |doi=10.7202/039213ar |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Whitlow, masculinist theory such as Farrell's and that of gender-studies scholar [[R.W. Connell]] developed alongside [[third-wave feminism]] and [[queer theory]], and was influenced by those theories' questioning of traditional [[gender role]]s and the meaning of terms such as ''man'' and ''woman''.{{refn|name=Whitlow 2010}}

Ferrel Christensen, a Canadian philosopher and president of the former Alberta-based Movement for the Establishment of Real Gender Equality,{{r|Menzies 2007}}&lt;ref name="Thorne 2000"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thorne |first1=Duncan |title=Gender bias in pamphlet, says human rights officer |url=https://www.fact.on.ca/news/news0006/ej000620.htm |work=The Edmonton Journal |date=20 June 2000 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010228064228/https://www.fact.on.ca/news/news0006/ej000620.htm |archive-date=28 February 2001 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes that "Defining 'masculism' is made difficult by the fact that the term has been used by very few people, and by hardly any philosophers." He differentiates between "progressive masculists", who welcome many of the societal changes promoted by feminists{{Cn|date=October 2024}}, while believing that some measures to reduce sexism against women have increased it against men, and an "extremist version" of masculism that promotes [[male supremacy]].{{Cn|date=October 2024}} He argued that if masculism and feminism refer to the belief that men/women are systematically discriminated against, and that this discrimination should be eliminated, there is not necessarily a conflict between feminism and masculism, and some assert that they are both. However, many believe that one sex is more discriminated against, and thus use one label and reject the other.&lt;ref name="Christensen 2005"/&gt;

According to Bethany M. Coston and [[Michael Kimmel]], members of the [[mythopoetic men's movement]] identify as masculinist.&lt;ref name=-"Coston 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coston |first1=Bethany M. |last2=Kimmel |first2=Michael |author-link2=Michael Kimmel |title=White Men as the New Victims: Reverse Discrimination Cases and the Men's Rights Movement |journal=Nevada Law Journal |date=2013 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=368–385, 371 |url=https://scholars.law.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1465&amp;context=nlj}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas Davidson, in ''The Failure of Feminism'' (1988),  calls ''masculism'' "virism": "Where the feminist perspective is that social ills are caused by the dominance of masculine values, the virist perspective is that they are caused by a decline of those values.&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="Davidson 1988"&gt;{{cite book |last=Davidson |first=Nicholas |title=The Failure of Feminism |pages=274–275 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Buffalo, NY |year=1988 |isbn=978-0-87975-408-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/failureoffeminis0000davi/page/274/mode/1up?view=theater |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christensen calls virism "an extreme brand of masculism and masculinism".&lt;ref name="Christensen 2005"/&gt;

In the wake of the abolition of [[apartheid]], South Africa saw a resurgence of masculinist [[Evangelicalism|Christian evangelical]] groups, led by the [[Mighty Men Conference]] (MMC) and the complementary [[Worthy Women Conference]] (WWC). The latter saw the development of what theologian [[Sarojini Nadar]] and psychologist Cheryl Potgeier call ''formenism'': "For''men''ism, like masculinism, subscribes to a belief in the inherent superiority of men over women (in other words, only men can be leaders), but unlike masculinism, it is not an ideology developed and sustained by men, but one constructed, endorsed and sustained by ''women''" [emphasis in original].&lt;ref name="Nadar 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nadar |first1=Sarojini |last2=Potgieter |first2=Cheryl |title=Liberated through submission?: The Worthy Woman's Conference as a case study of for''men''ism |journal=Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=141–151 |date=Fall 2010 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329208749 |format=PDF |via=ResearchGate |jstor=10.2979/fsr.2010.26.2.141 |doi=10.2979/fsr.2010.26.2.141}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|143}} The Mighty Men movement harkens back to the Victorian idea of [[Muscular Christianity]].
