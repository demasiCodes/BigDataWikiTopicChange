'''Masculism''' (also referred to as '''masculinism''') consists of [[social theory|social theories]], [[political movement]]s, and [[moral philosophy|moral philosophies]] primarily based on the experiences of [[men]]. Although masculism provides a general critique of [[social]] relations, many of its active proponents also seek to analyze gender inequality and promote [[men's rights]], interests, and issues. 

==History of masculism==
In his writing between the world wars, [[H.L. Mencken]] in some degree predicted masculism, wryly addressing topics still in current circulation. 

"..as women shake off their ancient disabilities they will also shake off some of their ancient immunities.."  
"Now that women have the political power to obtain their just rights, they will begin to lose their old power to obtain special privileges by sentimental appeals. Men, facing them squarely, will consider them anew, not as romantic political and social invalids, to be coddled and caressed, but as free competitors in a harsh world. When that reconsideration gets under way there will be a general overhauling of the relations between the sexes, and some of the fair ones, I suspect, will begin to wonder why they didn't let well enough alone."   -H. L. Mencken, [[In Defense of Women]], Chapter five: The New Age
 
Modern masculism has evolved in part as a response to changing women's roles. The feminist advocacy for professional women led to a similar advocacy for fathers. For example, following the "working woman" TV programs of the 1970s (such as ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'') came numerous "single father" shows (such as ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'' and ''[[Silver Spoons]]''), as well as the child-custody themed motion picture ''[[Kramer vs. Kramer]]''.

Masculism, however, is not merely a response to feminism. There are many issues, such as military conscription and fatherhood, that are regarded by proponents as concerns for men in their own right.

[[Warren Farrell]] is probably the most prominent author using the term "masculist" today.

==Masculist concerns==
{{Synthesis|article|date=August 2007|}}
{{discrimination}}
Masculists cite one-sided legislation, selective enforcement, and neglected [[civil rights]] as examples of discrimination against men and boys. Examples may include:

===Violence===

Masculist concerns focus on societal acceptance of violence harming men paired with the stigma against violence harming women, as well as males being taught or expected to take on violent roles.

* men forced to risk their lives in male-only [[conscript]]ed [[military]] service 
* claims by radical feminists that the majority of men have the potential to be rapists.
* portrayal of "violence against women" as more important than other forms of violence, including "violence against men" (e.g. "never hit a woman/girl, but it is acceptable for a woman to beat a man")  
* depiction of violence against men as humorous, in the media (e.g., the movie ''[[I Love You to Death]]'') &lt;ref name=MYTH&gt; ''The Myth of Male Power: Why Men Are the Disposable Sex''; Warren Farrell, Simon &amp; Schuster, New York, 1993: ISBN 0-671-79349-7&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere (see [[Boys are stupid, throw rocks at them!]]), when women are equally violent.
* assumption of female innocence or sympathy for women, which may result in problems such as disproportionate penalties for similar crimes, &lt;ref name=MYTH /&gt; male victims charged in [[domestic violence]] cases, more boys [[filicide|killed by parents]] than girls and male [[rape]] victims by women. 
* societal failure to address [[prison rape]] issues such as prevention (e.g., reducing prison crowding that requires sharing of cells), enforcement, and even correctional staff punishing prisoners by confining them with known rapists. [http://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/prison/report8.html#_1_50] Attention has been drawn to portrayals of male rape by women, or implied rape, as humorous (as seen in the [[Virgin Mobile]] adverts featuring [[Wyclef Jean]]) where portrayals of female rape could not acceptably be used in this fashion.[http://www.q.co.za/2001/2002/10/07-OverRainbow.html]
* male genital mutilation (circumcision) being socially accepted or even advocated as opposed to female genital mutilation.

=== Parenting ===
* equality in [[child custody]], such as [[shared parenting]]
* [[Pregnancy|pregnancies]] carried to term despite agreements ahead of time that they would not be, subjecting men to unwanted parental responsibilities and/or child support expectations (see ''[[Dubay v. Wells]]'')
* The opposite of the above, where a man who feels he wants to have a child has no say in whether his girlfriend/wife aborts his child (see [[paternal rights and abortion]])
* equality in adoption rights (several states allow single women to adopt children but not single men)

=== Discrimination ===
* Legislation that addresses women's needs without considering the corresponding need in men (e.g., ''Women, Infants, and Children Act''; ''Violence Against Women Act'') 
* Biases in the justice system against men, such as higher incarceration rates and longer sentences for men (compared to women) for the same crimes
* [[Statutory rape]] laws enforced more vehemently in instances where the victim is female and/or the perpetrator is male (e.g. the cases of [[Mary Kay Letourneau]] and [[Vili Fualaau]], [[Pamela Rogers]], and [[Debra Lafave]] [http://www.newsamericanow.com/archives/2006/03/22/video_debra_lafave_press_confe.html] [http://www.reason.com/cy/cy060402.shtml ''Double Standard: The Bias Against Male Victims of Sexual Abuse''])
* [[Rape shield law]]s, which prevent men from having a fair trial
* [[Cathy Young]], who does not consider herself a "masculinist," argues that in rape cases, "the dogma that "women never lie" means that there is, for all intents and purposes, no presumption of innocence for the defendant"[http://dir.salon.com/story/mwt/feature/2004/03/26/rape_shield/index.html?sid=1213003]
* Women may marry at younger ages than men in some U.S. states. [http://www.law.cornell.edu/topics/Table_Marriage.htm])
* Men pay higher premiums for auto, health, life and disability insurance, though other forms of discrimination are prohibited.
* Men not being 'believed' when being raped by their [[Wife]], [[Girlfriend]] or [[Fiancee]]; lesser or no penalty for women that rape men

=== Social concerns ===
* increasing [[suicide]] rate among young men, four times higher than among young women [http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=5228]; (73% of all suicide deaths are white males in the United States&lt;ref&gt;http://www.policyalmanac.org/health/archive/suicide.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;; In the United States, more women than men report a history of attempted suicide, with a gender ratio of 3:1)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.policyalmanac.org/health/archive/suicide.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
* lack of advocacy for men's rights; more social programs for women than for men
* bias in health concerns; for example, more advertisements and awareness for breast cancer than prostate cancer, though the latter kills more men than the former kills women
* incarceration for not paying child support   
* special government agencies for women's affairs with no corresponding agencies for men's affairs 
* lack of legal ramifications or enforcement for [[paternity fraud]]

=== Education ===
{{Unreferencedsection|date=August 2007}}
Lack of educational aid for boys and men, given that their performance/enrollment at most levels lags behind that of girls and women; some states declaring (de jure or de facto) all-male schools illegal and all-female schools legal.

There is concern that some [[higher education|university]] [[Women's studies]] departments are more concerned with teaching feminist ideology than equality of gender. The content and emphasis of these courses vary, and some even discuss "masculinities"; but masculists fear that many such courses contribute to animosity towards men.

Some universities also carry "men's studies" courses. Some feminists argue that these are redundant, stating that academia throughout history was predominantly focused on men; however, supporters of these courses note that most subjects throughout history have not dealt with gender directly.

===Employment===
* Harder physical entrance criteria for men in many occupations - such as the army, police and fire service. Requiring men to be physically stronger than women in these occupations leaves men responsible for a greater share of the physical work, for no more pay. {{Fact|date=August 2007}}
* legal inequality and protections of paternal vs. maternal leave {{Fact|date=August 2007}}

== Differences in masculist ideology ==
{{Unreferencedsection|date=July 2007}}
There is no consensus as to what exactly constitutes "masculism." Some feel the word describes a belief that the male and female genders should be considered complementary and interdependent by necessity. Such expressions of masculism are built around the belief that differentiated [[gender role]]s are natural and should be exempt from government interference. Others masculists, such as [[Warren Farrell]], support an ideology of equivalence between the sexes, rather than a belief in unchangeable gender differences. A more encompassing definition might be "a movement to empower males in society, and to redress discrimination against men."

Because it is the name of a political and social movement, masculism is sometimes considered synonymous with the [[men's rights]] or [[fathers' rights]] movements. However, many of the fathers' rights movement make a clear distinction between masculism and their own often quite varied approaches to gender relations.

Some masculists state that there is a covert [[matriarchy]] and that one of their goals is to overturn it, and elect masculist politicians, whom they would consider more altruistically motivated. Theorists such as [[David Constantine]] envision structural changes in taxation or other areas to compensate for what they see as natural differences and expectations between genders.

Gender roles in [[religion]] are a source of disagreement among masculists: some support a general leadership role for men, while others argue for relative equality between the genders. Liberal masculists such as Warren Farrell tend to favour a [[secularism|secular]], gender-neutral stance, whereas conservatives tend to prefer a religious approach, such as represented in ''The Inevitability of Patriarchy'' by [[Steven Goldberg]]. Conservatives may promote a "New Patriarchy" by countering feminist ideology with their own. Such liberal-conservative dynamics illustrate the diversity of a movement that nonetheless has a unified purpose of promoting men's welfare. 

=== Conservative views === 
{{Unreferencedsection|date=August 2007}}
Conservative masculists tend to believe that profound gender differences are inherent in [[human nature]]. They believe that feminists who have denounced differentiated gender roles as an oppressive artificial construct are conducting a [[logical fallacy|fallacious]] experiment by attempting to negate these differences via legislation and other means. Many conservatives believe that feminism has played a role in the high rates of [[divorce]] (see [[marriage strike]]), alienation of the genders, [[female chauvinism]], [[love-shyness]], disintegrating communities, fatherless children, high school dropout, drug [[addiction]], [[consumerism]], [[teenage pregnancy]], male [[suicide]], [[violent crime]] (especially murder), [[Road rage (phenomenon)|road rage]], and overfilled [[prison]]s.

Critics of gender equality laws (beginning with the [[U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964]]) believe they have helped to make feminist ideology [[mainstream]] - that such laws serve primarily women and have created significant [[Constitutional law|unconstitutional]] [[sexual discrimination|discrimination]] against men. While some feminists fight against an "all-powerful [[patriarchy]],” conservative masculists tend to consider patriarchy an inevitable result of the biological differences between the sexes. Some disagree that women are powerless victims of oppression; they suggest that feminists use this idea to curtail men's rights and to justify their negative views of men. Certainly women have not been oppressed in the same way or degree as other marginalized groups, such as African Americans.  Masculists claim this has achieved a covert [[matriarchy]], aided by chivalry towards women that itself undermines the theory of female oppression.

Some men urge a return to responsible [[patriarchy]], often by appealing to traditional religious views of male power being ordained by God.

=== Progressive views ===
[[Progressivism|Progressives]] tend to view masculism as a complementary movement to feminism, the so-called "New Masculinity." Both feminism and masculism are seen as attempts to correct disadvantages induced by gender roles. Whereas feminists address areas they believe women to be disadvantaged, such as equal pay, job opportunities and promotion, masculists address areas they believe men to be disadvantaged, such as divorce and custody, health, criminal prosecution and sentencing. These masculists may object to specific aspects of feminism or to the expressed views of specific feminist groups, without rejecting feminism as a concept or believing that the feminist movement as a whole is hostile to masculism. Some sociologists regard masculism with suspicion, seeing it as a reactionary, even misogynistic movement at odds with feminism. Others accept that feminists and masculists are natural allies against a common enemy, sexism, which is (or which can be) as damaging to men as it is to women.

For example, Warren Farrell states in ''The Myth of Male Power'' that both genders are hampered by the "bisexist" roles of the past: sexism that oppresses both genders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Farrell, Ph.D. |first=Warren  |title=The Myth of Male Power |year=1993 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. |location=New York, New York |isbn=0425181448}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasises the compatibility of both movements: "I use two podiums to debate myself as a feminist and masculist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.warrenfarrell.com/pages.php?id=39 |title=Warren Speaking |accessdate=2007-09-21 |format= |work=warrenfarrell.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Hayward]], in his speech to the [[National Congress for Men]] in [[1981]], states: "We must not reverse the women's movement; we must accelerate it... [Men's liberation] is not a backlash, for there is nothing about traditional sex roles that I want to go back to." 

This suggests that masculism in his conception can assist and aid the women's movement. Feminists have responded to this with both encouragement and trepidation. Some feminists believe that space for women to have a voice would be threatened by the presence of men, or that a growing presence of men in the women's movement would displace the voices of the women. Others greet masculist interests in the women's movement as important for the eradication of sexism in society.

Likewise, gender egalitarians call for both masculists and feminists who are truly interested in equality to unite under one banner of [[gender egalitarianism]]. This philosophy is sympathetic to legitimate grievances of both males and females.
