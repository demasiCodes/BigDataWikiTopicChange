'''Polyculturalism''' is an ideological approach to the consequences of intercultural engagements within a geographical area which emphasises similarities between, and the enduring interconnectedness of, groups which self-identify as distinct, thus blurring the boundaries which may be perceived by members of those groups.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal&amp;Levy2010"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1751-2409.2010.01022.x|title=The Colorblind, Multicultural, and Polycultural Ideological Approaches to Improving Intergroup Attitudes and Relations|journal=Social Issues and Policy Review|volume=4|pages=215–246|year=2010|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Lisa|last2=Levy|first2=Sheri R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of polyculturalism was first proposed by [[Robin Kelley]] and [[Vijay Prashad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/cultures-fuse-and-connect-so-we-should-embrace-polyculturalism-78876|title=Cultures fuse and connect, so we should embrace polyculturalism|last=Haslam|first=Nick|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from [[multiculturalism]] which instead emphasises the separateness of the identities of self-identifying cultural groups with an aim of preserving and celebrating their differences in spite of interactions between them. Supporters of polyculturalism oppose multiculturalism, arguing that the latter's emphasis on difference and separateness is divisive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hikevipadan.blogspot.com//%7B%7Bfull%7D%7D|title=Polyculturalism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sbs.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/topics/life/culture/article/2017/06/07/if-multiculturalism-isnt-working-why-not-embrace-polyculturalism%7B%7Bfull%7D%7D|title=Latest News &amp; Opinion on Culture &amp; Social Affairs - SBS Life|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and harmful to social cohesion.&lt;ref name="JP&amp;MA2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Podur|first1=Justin|last2=Albert|first2=Michael|date=15 July 2003|title=Revolutionizing Culture Part One|url=https://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/10125|journal=Podur ZMag|volume=|issue=|pages=|doi=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611094904/https://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/10125|archive-date=11 Jun 2008|access-date=17 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyculturalism was the subject of the 2001 book ''Everybody Was Kung Fu Fighting: Afro-Asian Connections and the Myth of Cultural Purity'' by [[Vijay Prashad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040823095427/http://www.semcoop.com/detail/0807050105|title=Everybody Was Kung Fu Fighting -- Afro-Asian Connections and the Myth of Cultural Purity -- Vijay Prashad|date=23 August 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown that belief in polyculturalism is linked to cultural intelligence (CQ) in [[Australia]] and [[China]].&lt;ref name="BP2017"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2017.08.006|title=Belief in polyculturalism and cultural intelligence: Individual- and country-level differences|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=119|pages=307–310|year=2017|last1=Bernardo|first1=Allan B.I|last2=Presbitero|first2=Alfred}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that polyculturists are less likely to demonstrate [[sexism|sexist]] attitudes.&lt;ref name="RLM2017"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684313510152 |pmid=25530662 |pmc=4266561 |title=Polyculturalism and Sexist Attitudes |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=519–534 |year=2014 |last1=Rosenthal |first1=Lisa |last2=Levy |first2=Sheri R |last3=Militano |first3=Maria }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown that polyculturalism has a positive relationship with cross-cultural attitudes in both the [[Philippines]] and the [[United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijintrel.2012.12.005 |title=Polyculturalism and attitudes towards people from other countries |journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=335–344 |year=2013 |last1=Bernardo |first1=Allan B.I |last2=Rosenthal |first2=Lisa |last3=Levy |first3=Sheri R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like advocates of [[multiculturalism]], proponents of polyculturalism encourage individuals to learn about different cultures, especially those they may come into contact with in their own areas.&lt;ref name="JK" /&gt; However whereas multiculturalism advocates for toleration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040823095427/http://www.semcoop.com/detail/0807050105%7B%7Bfull%7D%7D|title=Wayback Machine|date=23 August 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; between members of distinctly different cultures groups, polyculturalism is less rigid and acknowledges that individual shape their own identities and may choose to change&lt;ref name="JP&amp;MA2003" /&gt; so as to express their culture in a different way to their own ancestors, either by adding elements of other cultures to it or by eliminating aspects of it.&lt;ref name="JK" /&gt;

Polyculturalism rejects the concept of race as a [[social construct]] with no scientific basis,&lt;ref name="JK"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Korber |first1=John |last2= |first2= |date= |title=Polyculturalism |url=http://members.aol.com/Jakajk/Oneworld.html |journal=One World One People |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014230838/http://members.aol.com/Jakajk/Oneworld.html |archive-date=14 Oct 2008 |access-date=17 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; however it recognises the concept of ethnicity,&lt;ref name="AG"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gibbons |first1=Andrea |last2= |first2= |date= |title=Vijay Prashad: Polyculturalism and Kung Fu |url=http://writingcities.com/2016/09/27/vijay-prashad-polyculturalism-kung-fu/ |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; considering ethno-nationalism a barrier which must be transcended in the pursuit of a dynamic community culture.

Critics of [[multiculturalism]] argue that it entrenches [[identity politics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0026490 |pmid=22250894 |title=The relation between polyculturalism and intergroup attitudes among racially and ethnically diverse adults |journal=Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=1–16 |year=2012 |last1=Rosenthal |first1=Lisa |last2=Levy |first2=Sheri R }}&lt;/ref&gt; while polyculturalism aims to forge a common new identity&lt;ref name="sbs.com.au"/&gt;

Polyculturalism acknowledges that cultures are dynamic, interactive and impure while [[multiculturalism]] treats them as static, isolated and complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Haslam |first1=Nick |title=Cultures fuse and connect, so we should embrace polyculturalism |url=https://theconversation.com/cultures-fuse-and-connect-so-we-should-embrace-polyculturalism-78876 |website=The Conversation |accessdate=25 August 2018 |language=en |date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
