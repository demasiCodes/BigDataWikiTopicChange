While disability usually stems from a physical or mental medical condition, it is important to distinguish between ''impairment'' and ''disability''. This is perhaps best illustrated by an example:

As recently as the 1960s, left-handedness was seen as an abnormality. In schools in the Western world, left-handed children were forced to write with their right hand and punished if they did not comply. By the 1980s, left-handedness was accepted as simply a difference; a physical characteristic. Yet if tools such as scissors and corkscrews are only available in their right-handed forms, a left-handed person finds themselves disabled. 

Thus, in the social model of disability, the disability is caused by society and the physical environment.
