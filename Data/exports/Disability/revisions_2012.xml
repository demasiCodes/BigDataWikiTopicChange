{{Disability}}
[[Image:Handicapped Accessible sign.svg|thumb|[[International Symbol of Access]]]]
A '''disability''' may be physical, cognitive, mental, sensory, emotional, developmental or some combination of these. A disability may be present from birth, or occur during a person's lifetime.

{{quote|Disabilities is an umbrella term, covering impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions. An ''impairment'' is a problem in body function or structure; an ''activity limitation'' is a difficulty encountered by an individual in executing a task or action; while a ''participation restriction'' is a problem experienced by an individual in involvement in life situations. Thus disability is a complex phenomenon, reflecting an interaction between features of a person’s body and features of the society in which he or she lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Disabilities |url=http://www.who.int/topics/disabilities/en/ |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An individual may also qualify as disabled if he/she has had an impairment in the past or is seen as disabled based on a personal or group [[convention (norm)|standard]] or [[norm (sociology)|norm]]. Such impairments may include physical, [[sense|sensory]], and [[cognitive impairment|cognitive]] or [[Developmental disability|developmental disabilities]]. [[Mental disorder]]s (also known as psychiatric or psychosocial disability) and various types of [[chronic disease]] may also qualify as disabilities.

Some advocates object to describing certain conditions (notably [[Deaf culture|deafness]] and [[autism spectrum|autism]]) as "disabilities", arguing that it is more appropriate to consider them developmental differences that have been unfairly stigmatized by society.&lt;ref name="The New Wave of Autism Rights Activists"&gt;{{cite web |last=Solomon |first=Andrew |title=The New Wave of Autism Rights Activists |url=http://nymag.com/news/features/47225/ |publisher=New York Magazine |accessdate=October 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of disability==
Disability is caused by impairments to various subsystems of the body&amp;nbsp;– these can be broadly sorted into the following categories.

===Physical disability===
{{Main|Physical disability}}
Any impairment which limits the physical function of limbs or fine or gross motor ability is a physical disability.  Other physical disabilities include impairments which limit other facets of daily living, such as severe [[sleep apnea]].
[[Image:Army.mil-2007-02-07-103140.jpg|thumb|A man with an above the knee amputation exercises while wearing a prosthetic leg]]

===Sensory disability===
{{further|Sensory system}}
Sensory disability is impairment of one of the senses. The term is used primarily to refer to vision and hearing impairment, but other senses can be impaired.

====Visual impairment====
{{Main|Visual impairment}}
Visual impairment (or vision impairment) is [[vision loss]] (of a person) to such a degree as to qualify as an additional support need through a significant limitation of [[visual perception|visual]] capability resulting from either [[disease]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]], or congenital or degenerative conditions that cannot be corrected by conventional means, such as refractive correction, medication, or surgery.&lt;ref name="Arditi"&gt;Arditi, A., &amp; Rosenthal, B. (1998). "Developing an objective definition of visual impairment." In ''Vision '96: Proceedings of the International Low Vision Conference'' (pp. 331–334). Madrid, Spain: ONCE.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thomas"&gt;{{cite web |date=May 1, 2003 |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c108:H.R.+1902: |title=Medicare Vision Rehabilitation Services Act of 2003 HR 1902 IH |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="larrybelote"&gt;

# best corrected [[visual acuity]] of less than 20/60, or significant central field defect,
# significant peripheral field defect including homonymous or heteronymous bilateral visual, field defect or generalized contraction or constriction of field, or
# reduced peak contrast sensitivity with either of the above conditions.&lt;ref name="Arditi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thomas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="larrybelote"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medem.com/medlb/article_detaillb.cfm?article_ID=ZZZTPA3ZVIE&amp;sub_cat=0 medem.com] {{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hearing impairment====
{{Main|Hearing impairment}}
Hearing impairment or hard of hearing or deafness refers to conditions in which individuals are fully or partially unable to detect or perceive at least some frequencies of sound which can typically be heard by most people. Mild hearing loss may sometimes not be considered a disability.

====Olfactory and gustatory impairment====
Impairment of the sense of smell and taste are commonly associated with aging but can also occur in younger people due to a wide variety of causes.
{{Further|Olfaction#Disorders of olfaction}}
There are various olfactory disorders:
*[[Anosmia]]&amp;nbsp;– inability to smell
*[[Dysosmia]]&amp;nbsp;– things smell different than they should
*[[Hyperosmia]]&amp;nbsp;– an abnormally acute sense of smell.
*[[Hyposmia]]&amp;nbsp;– decreased ability to smell
*[[Olfactory Reference Syndrome]]&amp;nbsp;– psychological disorder which causes patients to imagine they have strong [[body odor]]
*[[Parosmia]]&amp;nbsp;– things smell worse than they should
*[[Phantosmia]]&amp;nbsp;– "hallucinated smell", often unpleasant in nature{{break|2}}

{{Further|Taste#Disorders of taste}}
Complete loss of the sense of taste is known as [[ageusia]], while [[dysgeusia]] is persistent abnormal sense of taste,

====Somatosensory impairment====
{{Main|Somatosensory disorder}}
Insensitivity to stimuli such as touch, heat, cold, and pain are often an adjunct to a more general physical impairment involving neural pathways and is very commonly associated with paralysis (in which the motor neural circuits are also affected).

====Balance disorder====
{{Main|Balance disorder}}
A balance disorder is a disturbance that causes an individual to feel unsteady, for example when standing or walking. It may be accompanied by symptoms of being giddy, woozy, or have a sensation of movement, spinning, or floating. Balance is the result of several body systems working together. The eyes (visual system), ears (vestibular system) and the body's sense of where it is in space (proprioception) need to be intact. The brain, which compiles this information, needs to be functioning effectively.

===Intellectual disability===
{{Main|Intellectual disability}}
Intellectual disability is a broad concept that ranges from mental retardation to cognitive deficits too mild or too specific (as in [[specific learning disability]]) to qualify as mental retardation. Intellectual disabilities may appear at any age. Mental retardation is a subtype of intellectual disability, and the term ''intellectual disability'' is now preferred by many advocates in most English-speaking countries as a [[euphemism]] for mental retardation.

===Mental health and emotional disabilities===
{{Main|Mental disorder}}
A mental disorder or mental illness is a psychological or behavioural pattern generally associated with subjective distress or disability that occurs in an individual, and perceived by the majority of society as being outside of normal development or cultural expectations. The recognition and understanding of mental health conditions has changed over time and across cultures, and there are still variations in the definition, assessment, and [[classification of mental disorders]], although standard guideline criteria are widely accepted.

===Developmental disability===
{{Main|Developmental disability}}
Developmental disability is any disability that results in problems with [[human development (biology)|growth and development]].  Although the term is often used  as a synonym or euphemism for intellectual disability, the term also encompasses many [[congenital medical condition]]s that have no mental or intellectual components, for example ''[[spina bifida]].''

===Nonvisible disabilities===
{{main|Invisible disability}}
Several chronic disorders, such as [[diabetes]], [[asthma]], [[inflammatory bowel disease]] or [[epilepsy]], would be counted as nonvisible disabilities, as opposed to disabilities which are clearly visible, such as those requiring the use of a [[wheelchair]].

==Sociology of disability==

===People-first language===
{{Main|People-first language}}
Many people would rather be referred to as a person with a disability instead of handicapped. "Cerebral Palsy: A Guide for Care" at the [[University of Delaware]] offers the following guidelines:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cerebral Palsy: a Guide for Care |url=http://gait.aidi.udel.edu/res695/homepage/pd_ortho/clinics/c_palsy/cpweb.htm |publisher=The Nemours Foundation |accessdate=July 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Impairment is the correct term to use to define a deviation from normal, such as not being able to make a muscle move or not being able to control an unwanted movement. Disability is the term used to define a restriction in the ability to perform a normal activity of daily living which someone of the same age is able to perform. For example, a three year old child who is not able to walk has a disability because a normal three year old can walk independently. Handicap is the term used to describe a child or adult who, because of the disability, is unable to achieve the normal role in society commensurate with his age and socio-cultural milieu. As an example, a sixteen-year-old who is unable to prepare his own meal or care for his own toileting or hygiene needs is handicapped. On the other hand, a sixteen-year-old who can walk only with the assistance of crutches but who attends a regular school and is fully independent in activities of daily living is disabled but not handicapped. All disabled people are impaired, and all handicapped people are disabled, but a person can be impaired and not necessarily be disabled, and a person can be disabled without being handicapped.}}

The [[American Psychological Association]] [[APA style|style guide]] states that, when identifying a person with an impairment, the person's name or pronoun should come first, and descriptions of the impairment/disability should be used so that the impairment is identified, but is not modifying the person. Improper examples are "a [[Borderline personality disorder|borderline]]", "a [[blindness|blind]] person", or "an [[Autism spectrum|autistic]] boy"; more acceptable terminology includes "a woman with [[Down syndrome]]" or "a man who has [[schizophrenia]]". It also states that a person's adaptive equipment should be described functionally as something that assists a person, not as something that limits a person, e.g., "a woman who uses a wheelchair" rather than "a woman in/confined to a wheelchair."

A similar kind of "people-first" terminology is also used in the UK, but more often in the form "people with impairments" (e.g., "people with visual impairments"). However, in the UK, the term "disabled people" is generally preferred to "people with disabilities". It is argued under the [[Social model of disability|social model]] that while someone's impairment (e.g., having a spinal cord injury) is an individual property, "disability" is something created by external societal factors such as a lack of wheelchair access to the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., [http://www.gcil.org.uk/FileAccess.aspx?id=59 Glascow Centre for Inclusive Living: The Social Model of Disability]&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction between the individual property of impairment and the social property of disability is central to the [[Social model of disability|social model]]. The term "disabled people" as a political construction is also widely used by international organisations of disabled people, such as [[Disabled Peoples' International]] (DPI).

===Literature===

====Masculinity====
According to author Daniel J. Wilson, the characteristics of [[masculinity]] include strength, activeness, speed, endurance, and courage. These characteristics are often challenged when faced with a disability and the boy or man must reshape what it means to be masculine. For example, rather than define "being a man" through what one can physically do, one must re-define it by how one faces the world with a disability and all the obstacles and [[stereotypes]] that come with the disability.&lt;ref name="Gendering Disability"&gt;Gendering Disability, Bonnie G. Smith and Beth Hutchison, ed., (New Jersey: [[Rutgers University Press]], 2005). ISBN 0-8135-3373-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In Leonard Kriegel's book, ''Flying Solo'', he describes his fight with [[poliomyelitis]] and the process of accepting his disability in a world that values able-bodiedness. He writes, "I had to learn to be my own hero, my own role model&amp;nbsp;– which is another way of saying that I had to learn to live with neither heroes nor role models" (pg. 40).&lt;ref name="Flying Solo"&gt;Flying Solo, Kriegel, Leonard. (Boston: [[Beacon Press]], 1998). ISBN 0-8070-7230-3&lt;/ref&gt;

====Femininity====
Some note that women who are disabled face what is called a "double disability", meaning they must not only deal with the stereotypes and challenges posed by [[femininity]], but they must also deal with those posed by being disabled. Culture also tends to view women as fragile and weaker than men, stereotypes which are only heightened when a woman has a disability.&lt;ref name="Gendering Disability" /&gt;

According to the "Survey of Income and Program Participation", as described in the book ''Gendering Disability'', 74 percent of women participants and 90 percent of men participants without disabilities were employed. In comparison, of those with a form of disability, 41 percent of women and 51 percent of men were employed. Furthermore, the nondisabled women participants were paid approximately $4.00 less per hour than the nondisabled men participants. With a disability, women were paid approximately $1.00 less than the nondisabled women participants and the men were paid approximately $2.00 less than the nondisabled men participants. As these results suggest, women without disabilities face societal hardships as compared to men, but disability added to the equation increases the hardships.&lt;ref name="Gendering Disability" /&gt;

===Disability and poverty===
There is a global correlation between [[disability and poverty]], produced by a variety of factors. Disability and poverty may form a vicious circle, in which physical barriers make it more difficult to get income, which in turn diminishes access to health care and other necessities for a healthy life.&lt;ref name="dfid"&gt;Yeo, R. (2005). Disability, poverty, and the new development agenda. Disability Knowledge and Research Programme. Webaccessed: http://www.dfid.gov.uk/r4d/PDF/Outputs/Disability/RedPov_agenda.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
The [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health]] (ICF), produced by the [[World Health Organization]], distinguishes between body functions (physiological or psychological, e.g., vision) and body structures (anatomical parts, e.g., the eye and related structures). Impairment in bodily structure or function is defined as involving an anomaly, defect, loss or other significant deviation from certain generally accepted population standards, which may fluctuate over time. Activity is defined as the execution of a task or action. The ICF lists 9 broad domains of functioning which can be affected:
*Learning and applying knowledge
*General tasks and demands
*Communication
*Basic physical mobility, Domestic life, and Self-care (i.e., [[activities of daily living]])
*Interpersonal interactions and relationships
*Community, social and civic life, including [[employment]]
*Other major life areas
In concert with disability scholars, the introduction to the ICF states that a variety of conceptual models has been proposed to understand and explain disability and functioning, which it seeks to integrate. These models include the following:

===The medical model===
{{Main|Medical model of disability}}

The [[medical model]] is presented as viewing disability as a problem of the person, directly caused by disease, trauma, or other health condition which therefore requires sustained medical care provided in the form of individual treatment by professionals. In the medical model, management of the disability is aimed at a "cure," or the individual’s adjustment and behavioral change that would lead to an "almost-cure" or effective cure. In the medical model, medical care is viewed as the main issue, and at the political level, the principal response is that of modifying or reforming [[healthcare]] policy.{{sfn|Nikora|Karapu|Hickey|Te Awekotuku|2004|p=5}}{{sfn|Donovan|2012|p=12}}

===The social model===
{{Main|Social model of disability}}
The social model of disability sees the issue of "disability" as a socially created problem and a matter of the full [[Inclusion (disability rights)|integration of individuals into society]]. In this model, disability is not an attribute of an individual, but rather a complex collection of conditions, many of which are created by the social environment. Hence, the management of the problem requires [[social activist|social action]] and it is the collective responsibility of society at large to make the environmental modifications necessary for the full participation of people with disabilities in all areas of social life. The issue is both [[cultural]] and [[ideological]], requiring individual, community, and large-scale social change. From this perspective, equal access for someone with an impairment/disability is a human rights issue of major concern.{{sfn|Nikora|Karapu|Hickey|Te Awekotuku|2004|p=6–7}}{{sfn|Donovan|2012|p=12}}

===Other models===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2011}}
* The '''spectrum model''' refers to the range of visibility, audibility and sensibility under which mankind functions. The model asserts that disability does not necessarily mean reduced spectrum of operations.
* The '''moral model''' refers to the attitude that people are ''morally responsible'' for their own disability.&lt;ref name="Disability Model"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kaplan |first=Deborah |title=Disability Model |url=http://www.peoplewho.org/debate/kaplan.htm |publisher=World Institute on Disability |accessdate=October 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example disability may be seen as a result of bad actions of parents if [[congenital]], or as a result of practicing witchcraft if not. This attitude may also be viewed as a [[religious fundamentalist]] offshoot of the original [[animal]] roots of human beings when humans killed any baby that could not survive on its own in the wild.  Echoes of this can be seen in the doctrine of [[karma]] in Indian religions.
* The '''expert/professional model''' has provided a traditional response to disability issues and can be seen as an offshoot of the medical model. Within its framework, professionals follow a process of identifying the impairment and its limitations (using the medical model), and taking the necessary action to improve the position of the disabled person. This has tended to produce a system in which an authoritarian, over-active service provider prescribes and acts for a passive client.{{sfn|Nikora|Karapu|Hickey|Te Awekotuku|2004|p=5–6}}
* The '''tragedy/charity model''' depicts disabled people as victims of circumstance who are deserving of [[pity]]. This, along with the medical model, are the models most used by non-disabled people to define and explain disability.{{sfn|Nikora|Karapu|Hickey|Te Awekotuku|2004|p=6}}
* The '''legitimacy model''' views disability as a value-based determination about which explanations for the atypical are legitimate for membership in the disability category. This viewpoint allows for multiple explanations and models to be considered as purposive and viable.{{sfn|DePoy|Gilson|2004}}
* The '''social adapted model''' states although a person’s disability poses some limitations in an able-bodied society, oftentimes the surrounding society and environment are more limiting than the disability itself.{{sfn|Nikora|Karapu|Hickey|Te Awekotuku|2004|p=7}}
* The '''economic model''' defines disability in terms of reduced ability to work, the related loss of productivity and economic effects on the individual, employer and society in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Economic Model of Disability |url=http://www.copower.org/models-of-disability/176-economic-model-of-disability.html |publisher=Michigan Disability Rights Coalition |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model is directly related to the charity/tragedy model.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
* The '''empowering model''' (also, '''customer model''')allows for the person with a disability and his/her family to decide the course of their treatment and what services they wish to benefit from. This, in turn, turns the professional into a service provider whose role is to offer guidance and carry out the client’s decisions. This model “empowers” the individual to pursue his/her own goals.{{sfn|Nikora|Karapu|Hickey|Te Awekotuku|2004|p=7}}
*The '''market model''' of disability is minority rights and consumerist model of disability that recognizing people with disabilities and their stakeholders as representing a large group of consumers, employees and voters.  This model looks to personal identity to define disability and empowers people to chart their own destiny in everyday life, with a particular focus on economic empowerment.  By this model, based on US Census data, there are 1.2 billion people in the world who consider themselves to have a disability.  An additional two billion people are considered stakeholders in disability (family/friends/employers), and when combined to the number of people without disabilities, represents 53% of the population.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} "This model states that, due to the size of the demographic, companies and governments will serve the desires, pushed by demand as the message becomes prevalent in the cultural mainstream."{{sfn|Donovan|2012|p=12}}
*The '''consumer model''' of disability is based upon the “rights-based" model and claims that people with disabilities should have equal rights and access to products, goods and services offered by businesses.  The consumer model extends the rights-based model by proposing that businesses, not only accommodate customers with disabilities under the requirements of legislation, but that businesses actively seek, market to, welcome and fully engage people with disabilities in all aspects of business service activities.  The model suggests that all business operations, e.g., websites, policies and procedures, mission statements, emergency plans, programs and services, should integrate access and inclusion practices.  Furthermore, these access and inclusion practices should be based on established customer service access and inclusion standards that embrace and support the active engagement of people of all abilities in business offerings.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, T.B.

==Management==

===Assistive technology===
{{Main|Assistive technology}}
[[Assistive Technology]] is a generic term for devices and modifications (for a person or within a society) that help overcome or remove a disability. The first recorded example of the use of a [[prosthesis]] dates to at least 1800 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Disability Social History Project&amp;nbsp;– Timeline |url=http://www.disabilityhistory.org/timeline_new.html |publisher=Disabilityhistory.org |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[wheelchair]] dates from the 17th century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The [[curb cut]] is a related structural innovation. Other examples are [[standing frames]], text [[telephones]], accessible [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboards]], [[large print]], [[Braille]], &amp; [[speech recognition]] [[software]]. People with disabilities often develop personal or community adaptations, such as strategies to suppress tics in public (for example in [[Tourette's syndrome]]), or [[sign language]] in [[deaf]] communities.

{{Main|Web accessibility|Design for All (in ICT)}}
As the [[personal computer]] has become more ubiquitous, various organizations have formed to [[software development|develop software]] and [[computer hardware|hardware]] to make computers more accessible for people with disabilities. Some software and hardware, such as [[Voice Finger]], [[Freedom Scientific]]'s ''[[JAWS (screen reader)|JAWS]]'', the Free and Open Source alternative ''[[Orca (assistive technology)|Orca]]'' etc. have been specifically designed for people with disabilities while other software and hardware, such as [[Nuance Communications|Nuance]]'s [[Dragon NaturallySpeaking]], were not developed specifically for people with disabilities, but can be used to increase accessibility.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
The [[LOMAK]] keyboard was designed in [[New Zealand]] specifically for persons with disabilities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Adapted sports===
{{Main|Disabled sports}}
[[Image:Wheelchair basketball at the 2008 Summer Paralympics.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wheelchair basketball]] match between South Africa and Iran at the [[Wheelchair basketball at the 2008 Summer Paralympics|2008 Summer Paralympics]]]]
The [[Paralympic Games]] (meaning "alongside the Olympics") are held after the (Summer and Winter) [[Olympics]]. The Paralympic Games include athletes with a wide range of physical disabilities. In member countries organizations exist to organize competition in the Paralympic sports on levels ranging from recreational to elite (for example, [[BlazeSports America]] in the United States).

The Paralympics developed from a rehabilitation programme for British war veterans with spinal injuries. In 1948, Sir Ludwig Guttman, a neurologist working with World War II veterans with spinal injuries at [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]] in [[Aylesbury]] in the UK, began using sport as part of the rehabilitation programmes of his patients.

In 2006, the [[Extremity Games]] was formed for people with physical disabilities, specifically limb loss or limb difference, to be able to compete in [[extreme sports]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Discrimination, government policies, and support==
{{Main|Ableism}}

===United Nations===
On December 13, 2006, the [[United Nations]] formally agreed on the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], the first human rights treaty of the 21st century, to protect and enhance the rights and opportunities of the world's estimated 650 million disabled people.  As of April 2011, 99 of the 147 signatories had ratified the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UN Enable&amp;nbsp;– Promoting the Rights of Persons with Disabilities |url=http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/ |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countries that sign the convention are required to adopt national laws, and remove old ones, so that persons with disabilities will, for example, have equal rights to education, employment, and cultural life; to the right to own and inherit property; to not be discriminated against in marriage, etc.; to not be unwilling subjects in medical experiments.

In 1976, the [[United Nations]] launched its International Year for Disabled Persons (1981), later renamed the [[International Year of Disabled Persons]]. The UN Decade of Disabled Persons (1983–1993) featured a World Programme of Action Concerning Disabled Persons. In 1979, [[Frank Bowe]] was the only person with a disability representing any country in the planning of IYDP-1981. Today, many countries have named representatives who are themselves individuals with disabilities. The decade was closed in an address before the General Assembly by [[Robert Davila]]. Both Bowe and Davila are [[deaf]]. In 1984, [[UNESCO]] accepted [[sign language]] for use in education of deaf children and youth.

===Costa Rica===
Under the ''Ley de Igualdad de Oportunidades'' (Law of Equal Opportunities), no person can be discriminated by their disabilities if they are equally capable as another person. This law also promotes that public places and transport should have facilities that enable people with disabilities to access them.

May 28 is the ''Día Nacional de la Persona con Discapacidad'' (National Disabled People Day) to promote respect for this population.

Currently the political party ''[[Partido de Acceso Sin Exclusión]]'' (Access Without Exclusion Party) fights for the rights of disabled persons, and one congressman, [[Óscar López (politician)|Oscar López]], is blind.

===United Kingdom===
Under the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995|Disability Discrimination Act (DDA)]] (1995, extended in 2005), it is unlawful for organisations to discriminate (treat a disabled person less favourably, for reasons related to the person's disability, without justification) in employment; access to goods, facilities, services; managing, buying or renting land or property; education. Businesses must make "reasonable adjustments" to their policies or practices, or physical aspects of their premises, to avoid indirect discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.drc-gb.org/the_law/legislation__codes__regulation/dda_and_related_statutes.aspx {{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010 the Disability Discrimination Act has been replaced with the Equality Act 2010. This act still protects disabled people against discrimination but also encompasses a number of other  characteristics including age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage, pregnancy, race, religion, sex and sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Independent Living Guide to Equality Act 2010 and How to Deal with Discrimination |url=http://www.independentliving.co.uk/equality-legislation.html |publisher=Independentliving.co.uk |date=October 1, 2010 |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of financial and care support services are available, including [[Incapacity Benefit]] and [[Disability Living Allowance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Disabled People: Financial support |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/DisabledPeople/FinancialSupport/fs/en |work=Directgov |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Employment====
The [[Employers' Forum on Disability]] (EFD) is a membership organisation of [[UK]] businesses. Following the introduction of the DDA the membership of EFD recognised the need for a tool with which they could measure their performance on disability year on year.

In 2005 80 organisations took part in the [[Disability Standard]] benchmark providing the first statistics highlighting the [[UK]]'s performance as a nation of [[employers]].

Following the success of the first [[Benchmarking|benchmark]] Disability Standard 2007 saw the introduction of the Chief Executives' Diamond Awards for outstanding performance and 116 organisations taking the opportunity to compare trends across a large group of UK employers and monitor the progress they had made on disability.

2009 will see the third benchmark, [[Disability Standard]] 2009. EFD have promised that for the first time they will publish a list of the top ten performers who will be honoured at an award ceremony in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;information on [[Employers' Forum on Disability]] (EFD) and Disability Standard edited from the official websites [http://www.efd.org.uk EFD.org.uk] and [http://www.disabilitystandard.com Disabilitystandard.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

====Discrimination in employment====
The US [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]] requires all organizations that receive government funding to provide accessibility programs and services. A more recent law, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA), which came into effect in 1992, prohibits private employers, state and local governments, employment agencies and labor unions from discriminating against qualified individuals with disabilities in [[application for employment|job application]] procedures, hiring, firing, advancement, compensation, job training, or in the terms, conditions and privileges of employment. This includes organizations like retail businesses, movie theaters, and restaurants. They must make "reasonable accommodation" to people with different needs. Protection is extended to anyone with (A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual, (B) a record of such an impairment, or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment. The second and third criteria are seen as ensuring protection from unjust discrimination based on a perception of risk, just because someone has a record of impairment or appears to have a disability or illness (e.g. features which may be erroneously taken as signs of an illness).

====African Americans and disability====
According to the 2000 U.S. Census, the African American community has the highest rate of disability at 20.8 percent, slightly higher than the overall disability rate of 19.4%.&lt;ref name = "census.gov-disabil"&gt;http://www.census.gov/population/www/pop-profile/disabil.html Disability {{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although people have come to better understand and accept different types of disability, there still remains a stigma attached to the disabled community. African Americans with a disability are subject to not only this stigma but also to the additional forces of race discrimination. African American women who have a disability face tremendous discrimination due to their condition, race, and gender. Doctor Eddie Glenn of Howard University describes this situation as the "triple jeopardy" syndrome.&lt;ref name="African American Women with Disabilities"&gt;African American Women with Disabilities: An Overview, [http://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/Us_Eu/ada_e/pres_com/pres-dd/glenn.html DINF.ne.jp]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social Security Administration====
The US [[Social Security Administration]] defines disability in terms of inability to perform substantial gainful activity (SGA), by which it means “work paying minimum wage or better”. The agency pairs SGA with a "listing" of medical conditions that qualify individuals for benefits.

====Education====
Under the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]], special educational support is limited to children and youth falling into one of a dozen disability categories (e.g., specific learning disability) and adds that, to be eligible, students may require both special education (modified instruction) and related services (supports such as speech and language pathology).

====Insurance====
It is illegal for California insurers to refuse to provide [[vehicle insurance|car insurance]] to properly licensed drivers solely because they have a disability.&lt;ref name="findlaw1"&gt;{{cite web |title=CAL. INS. CODE § 11628 : California Code&amp;nbsp;– Section 11628  |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/ins/11628-11629.5.html |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also illegal for them to refuse to provide car insurance "on the basis that the owner of the motor vehicle to be insured is blind," but they are allowed to exclude coverage for injuries and damages incurred while a blind unlicensed owner is actually operating the vehicle (the law is apparently structured to allow blind people to buy and insure cars which their friends, family, and caretakers can drive for them).&lt;ref name="findlaw1"/&gt;

==Demographics==

===Estimates worldwide===
Estimates of worldwide and country-wide numbers of individuals with disabilities are problematic. The varying approaches taken to defining disability notwithstanding, demographers agree that the world population of individuals with disabilities is very large. For example, in 2004, the [[World Health Organization]] estimated a world population of 6.5 billion people, of those nearly 100 million people were estimated to be moderately or severely disabled.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization"&gt;{{cite web |title=Disease incidence, prevalence and disability |url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GBD_report_2004update_part3.pdf |work=[http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/en/ Global Burden of Disease] |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2004 |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United States, Americans with disabilities constitute the third-largest minority (after persons of Hispanic origin and African Americans); all three of those minority groups number in the 30-some millions in America.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization" /&gt; According to the [[U.S. Bureau of the Census]], as of 2004, there were some 32 million disabled adults (aged 18 or over) in the United States, plus another 5 million children and youth (under age 18). If one were to add impairments—or limitations that fall short of being disabilities—Census estimates put the figure at 51 million.&lt;ref name="U.S. Bureau of the Census"&gt;{{cite web |title=American FactFinder |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/STTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_S1801&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_ |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also widespread agreement among experts in the field that disability is more common in developing than in developed nations. The connection between [[Disability_and_Poverty|disability and poverty]] is thought to be part of a "vicious cycle" in which these constructs are mutually reinforcing. &lt;ref&gt; Yeo, R. &amp; Moore, K. (2003). Including disabled people in poverty reduction work: “Nothing about us, without us”. World Development 31, 571-590.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly eight million men in Europe returned from the [[World War I]] permanently disabled by injury or disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kitchen |first=Martin |year=2000 |origyear=1980 |title=Europe Between the Wars |location=New York |publisher=Longman |isbn=0-582-41869-0 |oclc=247285240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 150,000 [[Vietnam veteran]]s came home wounded, and at least 21,000 were permanently disabled.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=513 The War's Costs]". Digital History.&lt;/ref&gt; Increased US military involvement has resulted in a significant increase of disabled military personnel since 2001. According to Fox News, this is a '25 percent' rise, with more than '2.9 million' total veterans now disabled.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,354985,00.html VA: Number of Disabled Veterans Rising]". FOXNews.com. May 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of war in Afghanistan, there are more than one million disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8073447.stm Homes for disabled in Afghanistan]". BBC News. May 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan has one of the highest incidences of people with disabilities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=26520 Afghanistan: People living with disabilities call for integration]". [[IRIN]] Asia. December 2, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 80,000 Afghans have lost limbs, mainly as a result of landmines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Norton-Taylor |first=Richard |date=February 13, 2008 |title=Afghanistan's refugee crisis 'ignored' |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/feb/13/afghanistan |location=London |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political issues==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2010}}
Political [[rights]], [[social inclusion]] and [[citizenship]] have come to the fore in developed and some developing countries. The debate has moved beyond a concern about the perceived cost of maintaining dependent people with disabilities to an effort of finding effective ways to ensure that people with disabilities can participate in and contribute to society in all spheres of life.

Many are concerned, however, that the greatest need is in developing nations—where the vast bulk of the estimated 650 million people with disabilities reside. A great deal of work is needed to address concerns ranging from accessibility and education to self-empowerment  and self-supporting  employment and beyond.

In the past few years, disability rights activists have also focused on obtaining full citizenship for the disabled.

However obstacles reside in some countries in getting full employment, also public perception of disabled people may vary in areas.

===Disability rights movement===
{{main|disability rights movement}}
The '''disability rights movement''' is the movement to secure equal opportunities and equal rights for people with disabilities. The specific goals and demands of the movement are: [[accessibility]] and [[safety]] in transportation, architecture, and the physical environment, equal opportunities in independent living, employment, education, and housing, and freedom from abuse, neglect, and violations of patients' rights.&lt;ref name="disabilityrightswi.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Disability Rights Wisconsin |url=http://www.disabilityrightswi.org/priority-issues/abuse-neglect-and-patient-rights |publisher=Disabilityrightswi.org |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective civil rights legislation is sought in order to secure these opportunities and rights.&lt;ref name="disabilityrightswi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Law"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bagenstos | first = Samuel | title = Law and the Contradictions of the Disability Rights Movement | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-300-12449-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disability insurance===
Disability benefit, or [[disability pension]], is a major kind of [[disability insurance]], and is provided by government agencies to people who are temporarily or permanently unable to work due to a disability. In the U.S., disability benefit is provided within the category of [[Supplemental Security Income]], and in Canada, within the [[Canada Pension Plan]]. In other countries, disability benefit may be provided under [[Social security]] systems.

Costs of disability pensions are steadily growing in Western countries, mainly European and the United States. It was reported that in the UK, expenditure on disability pensions accounted for 0.9% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1980, but two decades later had reached 2.6% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;OECD. Transforming disability into ability: Policies to promote work and income security for disabled people. Paris: OECD Publication Offices. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Labriola-Lund-2007"&gt;{{cite doi|10.7150/ijms.4.153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have reported a link between increased absence from work due to sickness and elevated risk of future disability pension.&lt;ref&gt;Virtanen M, Kivimaki M, Vahtera J, Elovainio M, Sund R, Virtanen P, Ferrie JE. Sickness absence as a risk factor for job termination, unemployment, and disability pension among temporary and permanent employees. Occup Environ Med. 2006;63(3):212–7&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by researchers in Denmark suggests that information on self-reported days of absence due to sickness can be used to effectively identify future potential groups for disability pension.&lt;ref name="Labriola-Lund-2007"/&gt; These studies may provide useful information for policy makers, case managing authorities, employers, and physicians.

Private, for-profit disability insurance plays a role in providing incomes to disabled people, but the nationalized programs are the safety net that catch most claimants.
