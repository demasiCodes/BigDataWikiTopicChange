The [[World Health Organisation]] defines Disability as follows:
''"Disabilities is an umbrella term, covering impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions. An impairment is a problem in body function or structure; an activity limitation is a difficulty encountered by an individual in executing a task or action; while a participation restriction is a problem experienced by an individual in involvement in life situations. 
''Thus disability is a complex phenomenon, reflecting an interaction between features of a person’s body and features of the society in which he or she lives.''''"''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/topics/disabilities/en/&lt;/ref&gt; 

An individual may also qualify as disabled if he/she has had an impairment in the past or is seen as disabled based on a personal or group [[standard]] or [[norm]]. Such impairments may include physical, [[sense|sensory]], and [[cognitive impairment|cognitive]] or [[intellectual impairment]]s. [[Mental disorder]]s (also known as psychiatric or psychosocial disability) and various types of [[chronic disease]] may also be considered qualifying disabilities. 

A disability may occur during a person's lifetime or may be present from birth.
A physical impairment is any disability which limits the physical function of limbs or fine or gross motor ability. 

==Current issues==

Current issues and debates surrounding disability include social and political [[rights]], [[social inclusion]] and [[citizenship]]. In developed countries, the debate has moved beyond a concern about the perceived cost of maintaining dependent people with disabilities to an effort of finding effective ways to ensure that people with disabilities can participate in and contribute to society in all spheres of life. 

Many are concerned, however, that the greatest need is in developing nations -- where the vast bulk of the estimated 650 million people with disabilities reside. A great deal of work is needed to address concerns ranging from accessibility and education to self-empowerment and self-supporting employment and beyond. 

In the past few years, disability rights activists have also focused on obtaining full citizenship for the disabled.

However obstacles reside in some countries in getting full employment, also public perception of disabled people may vary in areas.

== Disability rights movement ==

The [[disability rights movement]], led by individuals with disabilities, began in the 1970s. This [[self-advocacy]] is often seen as largely responsible for the shift toward [[Independent Living|independent living]] and [[accessibility]]. The term "Independent Living" was taken from 1959 [[California]] legislation which enabled people who had acquired a disability due to [[Poliomyelitis|polio]] to leave hospital wards and move back into the community with the help of cash benefits for the purchase of personal assistance with the activities of daily living. 

With its origins in the U.S. [[civil rights movements|civil rights]] and consumer movements of the late 1960s, the movement and its philosophy have since spread to other continents influencing self-perception, organization and social policy.

== Definitions and models ==
The [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health]] (ICF), produced by the [[World Health Organization]], distinguishes between body functions (physiological or psychological, e.g. vision) and body structures (anatomical parts, e.g. the eye and related structures). Impairment in bodily structure or function is defined as involving an anomaly, defect, loss or other significant deviation from certain generally accepted population standards, which may fluctuate over time. Activity is defined as the execution of a task or action. The ICF lists 9 broad domains of functioning which can be affected:

*Learning and applying knowledge
*General tasks and demands
*Communication
*Mobility
*Self-care
*Domestic life
*Interpersonal interactions and relationships
*Major life areas
*Community, social and civic life

(see also [[List of mental disorders]])

In concert with disability scholars, the introduction to the ICF states that a variety of conceptual models has been proposed to understand and explain disability and functioning, which it seeks to integrate. These models include the following:

=== The medical model===
{{mainarticle|Medical model of disability}}

The medical model is presented as viewing disability as a problem of the person, directly caused by disease, trauma, or other health condition which therefore requires sustained medical care provided in the form of individual treatment by professionals. In the medical model, management of the disability is aimed at a "cure," or the individual’s adjustment and behavioral change that would lead to an "almost-cure" or effective cure. In the medical model, medical care is viewed as the main issue, and at the political level, the principal response is that of modifying or reforming [[healthcare]] policy.

=== The social model===
{{mainarticle|Social model of disability}}

The social model of disability sees the issue of "disability" as a socially created problem and a matter of the full integration of individuals into society (see [[Inclusion (disability rights)]]). In this model, disability is not an attribute of an individual, but rather a complex collection of conditions, many of which are created by the social environment. Hence, the management of the problem requires [[social activist|social action]] and is the collective responsibility of society at large to make the environmental modifications necessary for the full participation of people with disabilities in all areas of social life. The issue is both [[cultural]] and [[ideological]], requiring individual, community, and large-scale social change. From this perspective, equal access for someone with an impairment/disability is a human rights issue of major concern.

=== The market model===

The market model of disability is a new model that builds on the social model in recognizing people with disabilities and their Stakeholders represent a large group of consumers, employees and voters.  This model looks to personal identity to define disability and empowers people to chart their own destiny in everyday life, with a particular focus on economic empowerment.   This model makes no judgements about ability, focusing on tangible and measurable results.  Its mantra is 'results, at all levels, create value'.   By this model, based on US Census data, there are 1.2 billion people in the world who consider themselves to have a disability.  An additional two billion people are considered Stakeholders in disability (family/friends/employers), and when combined to the number of people without disabilities, represents 53% of the population.  This model states that, due to the size of the demographic, companies and governments will serve the desires, pushed by demand as the message becomes prevalent in the cultural mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;[www.returnondisability.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other models===
* The '''spectrum model''' refers to the range of visibility, audibility and sensibility under which mankind functions. The model asserts that disability does not necessarily mean reduced spectrum of operations. Instead, it could also include distorted/shifted spectrum. For instance, a blind person may be extra sensitive to infrared or ultraviolet waves. See also [[Extra-sensory perception|ESP]].
* The '''moral model''' (Bowe, 1978) refers to the attitude that people are ''morally responsible'' for their own disability. For example, the disability may be seen as a result of bad actions of parents if [[congenital]], or as a result of practicing witchcraft if not. This attitude may also be viewed as a [[religious fundamentalist]] offshoot of the original [[animal]] roots of human beings when humans killed any baby that could not survive on its own in the wild.
* The '''expert/professional model''' has provided a traditional response to disability issues and can be seen as an offshoot of the Medical Model. Within its framework, professionals follow a process of identifying the impairment and its limitations (using the Medical Model), and taking the necessary action to improve the position of the disabled person. This has tended to produce a system in which an authoritarian, over-active service provider prescribes and acts for a passive client.
* The '''tragedy/charity model''' depicts disabled people as victims of circumstance who are deserving of [[pity]]. This, along with the Medical Model, are the models most used by non-disabled people to define and explain disability.
* The '''legitimacy model''' views disability as a value-based determination about which explanations for the atypical are legitimate for membership in the disability category. This viewpoint allows for multiple explanations and models to be considered as purposive and viable (DePoy &amp; Gilson, 2004)([[Elizabeth DePoy]] &amp; [[Stephen Gilson]]).
* The '''social adapted model''' states although a person’s disability poses some limitations in an able-bodied society, often times the surrounding society and environment are more limiting than the disability itself.&lt;ref name="Research Gateway"&gt; Research Gateway, http://waikato.researchgateway.ac.nz/bitstream/10289/460/1/content.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Economic Model''' 
Under this Model, disability is defined by a person’s inability to participate in work. It also assesses the degree to which impairment affects an individual’s productivity and the economic consequences for the individual, employer and the state. Such consequences include loss of earnings for and payment for assistance by the individual; lower profit margins for the employer; and state welfare payments.  This model is directly related to the Charity/Tragedy model.

The Economic Model is used primarily by policy makers to assess distribution of benefits to those who are unable to participate fully in work. In recent years, however, the preoccupation with productivity has conflicted with the application of the Medical Model to classify disability to counter fraudulent benefit claims, leading to confusion and a lack of co-ordination in disablement policy.

The challenge facing the Economic Model is how to justify and support, in purely economic terms, a socially desirable policy of increasing participation in employment. Classical economic laws of supply and demand stipulate that an increase in the labor market results in decreased wages. Arguably, extending access to work through equal opportunities reduces an employer’s labor costs, but other factors come into play.
The value of labor is based upon its contribution to marginal cost, i.e. the cost of producing the last unit of production. This only works when employees make an equal contribution to marginal cost. However, evidence suggests that disabled employees make a lower contribution than their work colleagues do, resulting in losses in production and lower profits for the employer.

Employers may recognize compensations for any loss in employing less-productive disabled employees through kudos, publicity, customer alignment and expansion arising from their presentations as an organization with community values. However, employers are not generally altruistic and hold the economic viability and operational effectiveness of their organization as higher priorities than demonstrating social awareness. Their economic option is to pay disabled employees less or have the losses met through subsidy.

The problem for the users of Economic Model is one of choice. Which is better: to pay the disabled employee for loss of earnings, or the employer for loss of productivity? The first carries stigma for the disabled person by underlining their inability to match the performance of work colleagues. With the latter, difficulties arise in correctly assessing the correct level of subsidy. The productivity of a disabled employee may well change, as well as the marginal costs of the total workforce.
This leaves one outstanding difficulty for the socially minded economist. How do we achieve an equitable, effective, value-for-money distribution of disability related benefits? It is likely that there will be people with disabilities that prevent them from doing working. There will be others whose productivity levels are so low that the tax benefits to the public purse are outweighed by the employment subsidy. In economic terms, these people are unemployable and should be removed from employment to supplementary benefits, saving the expenditure on the subsidy. But is this socially acceptable? This apparent conflict has created ambiguity in agreeing social security goals and has led to stigmatization of disabled people as a burden on public funds rather than partners in the creation of general social prosperity.

Social security benefits are not designed to remove disabled people from poverty. The policy maker needs to balance equity (the right of the individual to self-fulfillment and social participation through work) and efficiency. The true value of the Economic Model is maintaining this balance in the macroeconomic context of trade cycles, inflation, globalization and extraordinary events such as wars&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idahocdhd.org/DNN/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=l2Fbz509YAs%3D&amp;tabid=621]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

* The '''empowering model''' allows for the person with a disability and his/her family to decide the course of their treatment and what services they wish to benefit from. This, in turn, turns the professional into a service provider whose role is to offer guidance and carry out the client’s decisions. In other words, this model “empowers” the individual to pursue his/her own goals.&lt;ref name="Research Gateway" /&gt;

== Terminology ==
=== People First Language ===
The [[American Psychological Association]] [[APA style|style guide]] states that, when identifying a person with an impairment, the person's name or pronoun should come first, and descriptions of the impairment/disability should be used so that the impairment is identified, but is not modifying the person. Improper examples are "a [[Borderline personality disorder|borderline]]," "a [[blindness|blind]] person," or "an [[Autism spectrum|autistic]] boy;" more acceptable terminology includes "a woman with [[Down syndrome]]" or "a man who has [[schizophrenia]]." It also states that a person's adaptive equipment should be described functionally as something that assists a person, not as something that limits a person, e.g. "a woman who uses a wheelchair" rather than "a woman in/confined to a wheelchair."

A similar kind of "people first" terminology is also used in the UK, but more often in the form 'people with impairments' (e.g. "people with visual impairments"). However, in the UK, the term "disabled people" is generally preferred to "people with disabilities." It is argued under the [[Social model of disability|social model]] that while someone's impairment (e.g. having a spinal cord injury) is an individual property, "disability" is something created by external societal factors such as a lack of wheelchair access to their workplace.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [http://www.gcil.org.uk/FileAccess.aspx?id=59 Glascow Centre for Inclusive Living: The Social Model of Disability]&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction between the individual property of impairment and the social property of disability is central to the [[Social model of disability|social model]]. The term "disabled people" as a political construction is also widely used by international organisations of disabled people, such as [[Disabled Peoples' International]] (DPI).

Many people with [[autism spectrum disorders]] do not like people first language, because they feel that autism is a part of their personality. In their opinion, to call someone a "person with an autism spectrum disorder" implies that the ASD is somehow separate from the core of the person, or is a transitory or curable condition. [http://aspitude.blogspot.com/2009/03/autism-first-language.html]

=== Literature ===
Many books on disability and [[disability rights]] point out that 'disabled' is an identity that one is not necessarily born with, as disabilities are more often acquired than [[congenital]]. Some disability rights activists use an acronym TAB, "Temporarily Able-Bodied", as a reminder that many people will develop disabilities at some point in their lives due to accidents, [[illness]] (physical, mental or emotional), or late-emerging effects of genetics.

==== Masculinity ====
According author Daniel J. Wilson, the characteristics of [[masculinity]] include strength, activeness, speed, endurance, and courage. These characteristics are often challenged when faced with a disability and the boy or man must reshape what it means to be masculine. For example, rather than define "being a man" through what one can physically do, one must re-define it by how one faces the world with a disability and all the obstacles and [[stereotypes]] that come with the disability.&lt;ref name="Gendering Disability"&gt; Gendering Disability, Bonnie G. Smith and Beth Hutchison, ed., (New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 2005). ISBN 0-8135-3373-2 &lt;/ref&gt;

In Leonard Kriegel's book, ''Flying Solo'', he describes his fight with [[poliomyelitis]] and the process of accepting his disability in a world that values able-bodiedness. He writes, "I had to learn to be my own hero, my own role model -- which is another way of saying that I had to learn to live with neither heroes nor role models" (pg. 40).&lt;ref name="Flying Solo"&gt; Flying Solo, Kriegel, Leonard. (Boston: Beacon Press, 1998). ISBN 0-8070-7230-3 &lt;/ref&gt;

==== Femininity ====
Some note that women who are disabled face what is called a "double handicap," meaning they must not only deal with the stereotypes and challenges posed by [[femininity]], but they must also deal with those posed by being disabled. Just as men are expected to be strong and courageous, women are expected to fill the social roles of mother and housewives. Culture also tends to view women as fragile and weaker than men, stereotypes which are only heightened when the woman has a disability.&lt;ref name="Gendering Disability" /&gt;

According to the "Survey of Income and Program Participation," as described in the book ''Gendering Disability''," 74 percent of women participants and 90 percent of men participants without disabilities were employed. In comparison, of those with a form of disability, 41 percent of women and 51 percent of men were employed. Furthermore, the nondisabled women participants were paid approximately $4.00 less per hour than the nondisabled men participants. With a disability, women were paid approximately $1.00 less than the nondisabled women participants and the men were paid approximately $2.00 less than the nondisabled men participants. As these results suggest, women without disabilities face societal hardships against men, but then add disability to the equation and the hardships increase.&lt;ref name="Gendering Disability" /&gt;

== Government policies and support ==
=== United Nations ===

On [[December 13]], [[2006]], the [[United Nations]] formally agreed on the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], the first human rights treaty of the 21st century, to protect and enhance the rights and opportunities of the world's estimated 650 million disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/ ENABLE website] UN section on disability&lt;/ref&gt; Countries that sign up to the convention will be required to adopt national laws, and remove old ones, so that persons with disabilities would, for example, have equal rights to education, employment, and cultural life; the right to own and inherit property; not be discriminated against in marriage, children, etc; not be unwilling subjects in medical experiments.

In 1976, the [[United Nations]] launched its International Year for Disabled Persons (1981), later re-named the [[International Year of Disabled Persons]]. The UN Decade of Disabled Persons (1983-1993) featured a World Programme of Action Concerning Disabled Persons. In 1979, [[Frank Bowe]] was the only person with a disability representing any country in the planning of IYDP-1981. Today, many countries have named representatives who are themselves individuals with disabilities. The decade was closed in an address before the General Assembly by [[Robert Davila]]. Both Bowe and Davila are [[deaf]]. In 1984, [[UNESCO]] accepted [[sign language]] for use in education of deaf children and youth.

=== Costa Rica ===
Under the ''Ley de Igualdad de Oportunidades'' (Law of Equal Oportunities), no person can be discriminated by their disabilities if they are equally capable as another person. This law also promotes that public places and transport should have facilities that enable people with disabilities to access them.

May 28th is the ''Día Nacional de la Persona con Discapacidad'' (National Disabled People Day) to promote respect for these population.

Currently the political party ''[[Partido de Acceso Sin Exclusión]]'' (Access Without Exclusion Party) fights for the rights of handicapped persons, and one congressman, [[Oscar López]], who is blind.

=== United Kingdom ===
Under the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995|Disability Discrimination Act (DDA)]] (1995, extended in 2005), it is unlawful for organisations to discriminate (treat a disabled person less favourably, for reasons related to the person's disability, without justification) in employment; access to goods, facilities, services; managing, buying or renting land or property; education. Businesses must make "reasonable adjustments" to their policies or practices, or physical aspects of their premises, to avoid indirect discrimination.[http://www.drc-gb.org/the_law/legislation__codes__regulation/dda_and_related_statutes.aspx]

A number of financial and care support services are available, including [[Incapacity Benefit]] and [[Disability Living Allowance]] [http://www.direct.gov.uk/DisabledPeople/FinancialSupport/fs/en].

====Employment====

The [[Employers' Forum on Disability]] (EFD) is a membership organisation of [[UK]] businesses. Following the introduction of the DDA the membership of EFD recognised the need for a tool with which they could measure their performance on disability year on year.

In 2005 80 organisations took part in the [[Disability Standard]] benchmark providing the first statistics highlighting the [[UK]]'s performance as a nation of [[employers]].

Following the success of the first [[benchmark]] Disability Standard 2007 saw the introduction of the Chief Executives' Diamond Awards for outstanding performance and 116 organisations taking the opportunity to compare trends across a large group of UK employers and monitor the progress they had made on disability.

2009 will see the third benchmark, [[Disability Standard]] 2009. EFD have promised that for the first time they will publish a list of the top ten performers who will be honoured at an award ceremony in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;information on [[Employers' Forum on Disability]] (EFD) and Disability Standard edited from the official websites [http://www.efd.org.uk efd.org.uk] and [http://www.disabilitystandard.com disabilitystandard.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===

====Discrimination in employment====

The US [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]] requires all organizations that receive government funding to provide accessibility programs and services. A more recent law, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA), which came into effect in 1992, prohibits private employers, state and local governments, employment agencies and labor unions from discriminating against qualified individuals with disabilities in [[application for employment|job application]] procedures, hiring, firing, advancement, compensation, job training, or in the terms, conditions and privileges of employment. This includes organizations like retail businesses, movie theaters, and restaurants. They must make "reasonable accommodation" to people with different needs. Protection is extended to anyone with (A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual, (B) a record of such an impairment, or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment. The second and third critiera are seen as ensuring protection from unjust discrimination based on a perception of risk, just because someone has a record of impairment or appears to have a disability or illness (e.g. features which may be erroneously taken as signs of an illness). 

====African Americans and disability====

According to the 2000 U.S. Census, the African American community has the highest rate of disability at 20.8 percent,&lt;ref name = "census.gov-disabil"&gt;[http://www.census.gov/population/www/pop-profile/disabil.html Disability] Disability rates vary by age, sex, race, and ethnicity.&lt;/ref&gt; slightly higher than the overall disability rate of 19.4%.&lt;ref name = "census.gov-disabil"/&gt; Although people have come to better understand and accept different types of disability, there still remains a stigma attached to the disabled community. African Americans with a disability are subject to not only this stigma but also to the additional forces of race discrimination. African American women who have a disability face tremendous discrimination due to their condition, race, and gender. Doctor Eddie Glenn of Howard University describes this situation as the "triple jeopardy" syndrome.&lt;ref name="African American Women with Disabilities"&gt; African American Women with Disabilities: An Overview, http://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/Us_Eu/ada_e/pres_com/pres-dd/glenn.html &lt;/ref&gt;

====Social administration====

The US [[Social Security Administration]] defines disability in terms of inability to perform substantial gainful activity (SGA), by which it means “work paying minimum wage or better”. The agency pairs SGA with a "listing" of medical conditions that qualify individuals for benefits. 

====Education====
Under the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]], special educational support is limited to children and youth falling into one of a dozen disability categories (e.g., specific learning disability) and adds that, to be eligible, students may require both special education (modified instruction) and related services (supports such as speech and language pathology).

====Insurance====

It is illegal for California insurers to refuse to provide [[vehicle insurance|car insurance]] to properly licensed drivers solely because they have a disability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/ins/11628-11629.5.html California Insurance Code Section 11628.5.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also illegal for them to refuse to provide car insurance "on the basis that the owner of the motor vehicle to be insured is blind," but they are allowed to exclude coverage for injuries and damages incurred while a blind unlicensed owner is actually operating the vehicle (the law is apparently structured to allow blind people to buy and insure cars which their friends, family, and caretakers can drive for them).&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/ins/11628-11629.5.html California Insurance Code Section 11628.7.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==
===Difficulties in measuring===

The [[demography]] of disability is difficult. Counting persons with disabilities is challenging. That is because disability is not just a status condition, entirely contained within the individual. Rather, it is an interaction between medical status (say, having [[low vision]] or being blind) and the environment.{{Facts|date=December 2008}}

=== Estimates worldwide===
Estimates of worldwide and country-wide numbers of individuals with disabilities are problematic. The varying approaches taken to defining disability notwithstanding, demographers agree that the world population of individuals with disabilities is very large. For example, in 2004, the [[World Health Organization]] estimated a world population of 6.5 billion people, of those nearly 100 million people were estimated to be moderately or severely disabled.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization"&gt; World Health Organization, 2004, http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GBD_report_2004update_part3.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;
In the United States, Americans with disabilities constitute the third-largest minority (after persons of Hispanic origin and African Americans); all three of those minority groups number in the 30-some millions in America.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization" /&gt; According to the [[U.S. Bureau of the Census]], as of 2004, there were some 32 million disabled adults (aged 18 or over) in the United States, plus another 5 million children and youth (under age 18). If one were to add impairments -- or limitations that fall short of being disabilities -- Census estimates put the figure at 51 million.&lt;ref name="U.S. Bureau of the Census"&gt; U.S. Bureau of the Census, http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/STTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_S1801&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_ &lt;/ref&gt; 

There is also widespread agreement among experts in the field that disability is more common in developing than in developed nations.

== Disability insurance—nationalized and private ==
Disability benefit, or [[disability pension]], is a major kind of [[disability insurance]], and is provided by government agencies to people who are temporarily or permanently unable to work due to a disability. In the U.S., disability benefit is provided within the category of [[Supplemental Security Income]], and in Canada, within the [[Canada Pension Plan]]. In other countries, disability benefit may be provided under [[Social security]] systems.

Costs of disability pensions are steadily growing in Western countries, mainly European and the United States. It was reported that in the UK, expenditure on disability pensions accounted for 0.9% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1980, but two decades later had reached 2.6% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;OECD. Transforming disability into ability: Policies to promote work and income security for disabled people. Paris: OECD Publication Offices. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Labriola M, Lund T. Self-reported sickness absence as a risk marker of future disability pension. Prospective findings from the DWECS/DREAM study 1990-2004. Int J Med Sci 2007; 4:153-158. http://www.medsci.org/v04p0153.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have reported a link between increased absence from work due to sickness and elevated risk of future disability pension.&lt;ref&gt;Virtanen M, Kivimaki M, Vahtera J, Elovainio M, Sund R, Virtanen P, Ferrie JE. Sickness absence as a risk factor for job termination, unemployment, and disability pension among temporary and permanent employees. Occup Environ Med. 2006;63(3):212-7&lt;/ref&gt; 

A study by researchers in Denmark suggests that information on self-reported days of absence due to sickness can be used to effectively identify future potential groups for disability pension. [http://www.medsci.org/v04p0153.htm] These studies may provide useful information for policy makers, case managing authorities, employers, and physicians.

Private, for-profit disability insurance plays a role in providing incomes to disabled people, but the nationalized programs are the safety net that catch most claimants.

== Adaptations ==
===Assistive technology===
[[Image:Left hand bar control US 01 w sign.jpg|thumb|right|A hand-operated device allows normal driving for persons with leg disabilities in an [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] [[automobile|car]].]]
[[Assistive Technology]] (AT) is a generic term for devices and modifications (for a person or within a society) that help overcome or remove a disability. The first recorded example of the use of a [[prosthesis]] dates to at least 1800 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disabilityhistory.org/timeline_new.html Disability Social History Project]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A more recent notable example is the [[wheelchair]], dating from the 17th century. The [[curb cut]] is a related structural innovation. Other modern examples are [[standing frames]], text [[telephones]], accessible [[keyboards]], [[large print]], [[Braille]], &amp; [[speech recognition]] [[computer software]]. People with disabilities often develop personal or community adaptations, such as strategies to suppress tics in public (for example in [[Tourette's syndrome]]), or [[sign language]] in [[deaf]] communities. Assistive technology or interventions are sometimes controversial or rejected, for example in the controversy over [[cochlear implants]] for children. 

A number of symbols are in use to indicate whether certain accessibility adaptations have been made[http://www.gag.org/resources/das.php].

===Adapted sports===
{{main|Disabled sports}}
[[Image:Wheelchair basketball at the 2008 Summer Paralympics.jpg|thumb|upright|Wheelchair basketball at the 2008 Summer Paralympics]] 
The [[Paralympic Games]] (meaning 'alongside the Olympics') are now held after the (Summer and Winter) [[Olympics]]. The Paralympic Games include athletes who have a wide range of disabilities. In many countries, organizations exist to organize competition in the Paralympic sports on levels ranging from recreational to elite (for example, [[BlazeSports America]] in the United States).

In 2006, the [[Extremity Games]] was formed for people with physical disabilities, specifically limb loss or limb difference, to be able to compete in [[extreme sports]].  The [http://www.college-park.com College Park Industries,] a manufacturer of prosthetic feet, organized this event to give disabled athletes a venue to compete in this increasingly popular sports genre also referred to as [[action sports]].  This annual event held in the summer in Orlando, FL includes competitions in skateboarding, wakeboarding, rock climbing, mountain biking, surfing, moto-x and kayaking. Non-profit organizations have created programs to advance adaptive sports for regular recreation and sport opportunities.

===Accessible computing===

As the [[personal computer]] has become more [[ubiquity|ubiquitous]], various organizations have formed to [[software development|develop]] [[software]] and [[hardware]] to make computers more accessible for people with disabilities. Some software and hardware, such as [[SmartboxAT]]'s ''[[The Grid (software)|The Grid]]'', and [[Freedom Scientific]]'s ''[[JAWS (screen reader)|JAWS]]'' has been specifically designed for people with disabilities; other pieces of software and hardware, such as [[Nuance Communications|Nuance]]'s [[Dragon NaturallySpeaking]], were not developed specifically for people with disabilities, but can be used to increase accessibility.

Furthermore, organizations, such as [[AbilityNet]] and [[U Can Do IT]], provide assessment services that determine which assistive technologies will best assist an individual client. These organizations also train people with disabilities in how to use computer-based assistive technology.

The [[LOMAK]] keyboard was designed in [[New Zealand]] specifically for persons with disabilities.

The Internet is also used by disability activists and charities to network and further their goals.
