Negrophobia can be caused by various things e.g., traumatic events; but, commonly, it is an effect of [[racism]] or [[bigotry]].

==Lexicology==
The term derives from two components, ''negro'' and ''phobia'', and literally derives from "fear of black", from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and/or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''[[negro]]'', "black" and from Greek: φόβος, phóbos, "[[fear]]"). Other terms with similar meanings include ''afrophobia''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alexander|first1=Neville|title=Thoughts on the New South Africa|date=2013|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; antiblackness&lt;ref&gt;Religion, Theology, and Class: Fresh Engagements After Long Silence, p 177, Joerg Rieger - 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and blackophobia&lt;ref&gt;Afrasia: A Tale of Two Continents - Page 105, Ali A. Mazrui - 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, some publishers have discouraged designating individuals as ''blackophobes'', ''negrophobes'' or ''afrophobes'' and rather highlight the general epithet that is usually applied to racists.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln: Political Writings and Speeches - Page xxvi,  Terence Ball - 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes it is described rather as '''Anti-Black prejudice''', '''Anti-Black sentiment''', ''Anti-African prejudice''', and '''Anti-African sentiment'''.

==Overview==
There are differences in the senses that are applied to negrophobes or the noun negrophobia. Some senses use the term to describe discriminatory sentiment towards people who may identify with the black race.&lt;ref&gt;Max Planck Yearbook of United Nations Law - Page 492,  Rüdiger Wolfrum - 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This sense adopts the notion that a person with negrophobia believes his or her race is superior over the black race with [[xenophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;Ubuntu, Migration and Ministry: Page 88, Elina Hankela - 2014&lt;/ref&gt; However an alternative definition stays true to the original clinical meaning of the suffix phobia. Thereby negrophobia is not associated with [[racism]], but rather is associated with those who fear the black race.&lt;ref&gt;Black Soul, White Artifact: Fanon's Clinical Psychology and Social Theory
p 73, Jock McCulloch - 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, a segment on negrophobia was featured on ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show]]'' on [[MSNBC]].&lt;ref name=M&gt;{{cite web|work=[[MSNBC]]|url=http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/scaring-white-people-fun-and-profit|title=Scaring white people for fun and profit|date=July 21, 2010|authorlink=Rachel Maddow|author=Maddow, Rachel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Negrophobia", published by St. Martin's Press and written by Darius James&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Negrophobia and Reasonable Racism: The Hidden Costs of Being Black in America, An academic book written through the New York University press.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Negrophobia: A Race Riot in 1906, by Mark Bauerlein with Encounter Press.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Heritage Dictionary4&lt;/ref&gt;

Some, such as psychiatrist [[Frantz Fanon]], assert that Negrophobia is a form of "trauma for white people of the Negro".&lt;ref name="Alessandrini2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony C.
