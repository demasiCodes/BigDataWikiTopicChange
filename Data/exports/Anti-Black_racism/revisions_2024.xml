== Concepts ==

=== Anti-Black racism, colourphobia and negrophobia ===
''Anti-Black racism'', sometimes called ''negrophobia'' or ''colourphobia'',&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; is [[discriminatory]] sentiment towards people [[Racialization|racialised]] as [[Black people|Black]],&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LkZKAAAAMAAJ The Congregational Review, Volume 2]''. J.M. Whittemore. 1862. p. 629. Retrieved 10 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; often because the person believes that their [[Race (human categorization)|race]] is [[Supremacism|superior]] to the Black race.{{sfn|Hankela|2014|p=88}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Berwanger |first=Eugene H. |date=1972 |title=Negrophobia in Northern Proslavery and Antislavery Thought |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/273527 |journal=Phylon |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=266–275 |doi=10.2307/273527 |jstor=273527 |issn=0031-8906}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms Afrophobia (or Afriphobia) and melanophobia have also been used.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chinweizu, C., 2003. Afrocentric Rectification of Terms: Excerpt from: What Slave Trade? And other Afrocentric reflections on the Race War. ''TINABANTU: Journal of Advanced Studies of African Society'', ''1''(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Afrophobia ====

Afrophobia, or Afriphobia, is often used to describe racism (particularly [[Institutional racism|systemic racism]]) against [[Black people#Africa|Black people of African descent]], such as by the [[European Network Against Racism]] (ENAR).&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Privot, M., 2014. Afrophobia and the ‘Fragmentation of Anti-racism.’. ''Visible Invisible Minority: Confronting Afrophobia and Advancing Equality for People of African Descent and Black Europeans in Europe'', pp.31-38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Momodou, J. and Pascoët, J., 2014. Towards a European strategy to combat Afrophobia. ''European Network Against Racism, Invisible visible minority: Confronting Afrophobia and advancing equality for people of African descent and Black Europeans in Europe'', pp.262-272.&lt;/ref&gt; Others use Afrophobia to describe racism and [[xenophobia]] against all or some people of African descent, and especially [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|indigenous Africans]], for their perceived Africanness. This may also include prejudice against [[Culture of Africa|African traditions and culture]]. For example, Afrophobia is used to describe xenophobia in [[South Africa]] against people of other African nationalities for being too racially ''Black,'' too culturally ''African'', or both.&lt;ref&gt;Koenane, M.L.J. and Maphunye, K.J., 2015. Afrophobia, moral and political disguises: Sepa leholo ke la moeti. ''Td: The Journal for Transdisciplinary Research in Southern Africa'', ''11''(4), pp.83-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Anti-Black racism ====

''Anti-Black racism'' was a term first used by Canadian scholar Dr. Akua Benjamin in a 1992 report on [[Ontario]] [[race relations]]. It is defined as follows:

{{blockquote|Anti-Black racism is a specific manifestation of racism rooted in European colonialism, slavery and oppression of Black people since the sixteenth century. It is a structure of iniquities in power, resources and opportunities that systematically disadvantages people of African descent.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;}}

==== Melanophobia ====
''Melanophobia'' has been used to refer to both anti-Black racism&lt;ref&gt;Biale, D., Galchinsky, M. and Heschel, S. eds., 1998. ''Insider/outsider: American Jews and multiculturalism''. Univ of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Discrimination based on skin tone|colourism]] (prejudice against people with darker skin), especially in Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Madden, R., 2006. Tez de mulato. ''Colonialism and Race in Luso-Hispanic Literature'', p.114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torres-Saillant, S., 2003. Inventing the race: Latinos and the ethnoracial pentagon. ''Latino Studies'', ''1'', pp.123-151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mirmotahari, E., 2015. A Cloud of Semitic Mohammedanism: The African Novel and the Muslim Question in the National Age. ''Interventions'', ''17''(1), pp.45-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Negrophobia and colourphobia ====
The term ''racism'' is not attested before the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Definition of RACISM |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racism |access-date=2024-07-20 |website=www.merriam-webster.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but ''negrophobia'' (first recorded between 1810–1820; often capitalised), and later ''colourphobia'' (first recorded in 1834),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Definition of COLORPHOBIA |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/colorphobia |access-date=2024-07-20 |website=www.merriam-webster.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;"Colourphobia | Colorphobia, N., Etymology."

''Oxford English Dictionary'', Oxford UP, July 2023, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1093/OED/5704106894&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Dictionary.com {{!}} Meanings &amp; Definitions of English Words |url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/negrophobia |access-date=2024-07-20 |website=Dictionary.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":022"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Garcia |first=J.

The term ''negrophobia'' may also have been inspired by the word ''nigrophilism'', itself first appearing in 1802 in Baudry des Lozières's ''Les égarements du nigrophilisme''.&lt;ref name="une2"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Une Autre Histoire |date=13 January 2015 |title=Négrophobie |url=http://une-autre-histoire.org/negrophobie/ |access-date=6 May 2020 |website=une-autre-histoire.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting the shift of ''-phobia'' terms to cover prejudice and hatred rather than mere fear or aversion, J. L. A. Garcia refers to ''negrophobia'' as "the granddaddy of these ‘-phobia’ terms", preceding both [[xenophobia]] and [[homophobia]].&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt;

Both at the time, and since, critics of the terms ''negrophobia'' and ''colourphobia'' have argued that, although their use of ''-phobia'' is rhetorical, if taken literally they could be used to excuse or justify the behaviour of racists as mental illness or disease. John Dick, publisher of ''The North Star'', voiced such concerns as early as 1848 while legal scholar Jody David Armour has voiced similar concerns in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Nevertheless, negrophobia had a clinical and satirical edge that made it popular with abolitionists.&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1856, abolitionist [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] published ''[[Dred: A Tale of the Great Dismal Swamp]],'' a novel which explored the fear of Blackness within ''negrophobia'' via the titular character Dred, a Black revolutionary [[Maroons|Maroon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McLaughlin |first=Don James |date=2019 |title=Dread: The Phobic Imagination in Antislavery Literature |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/56/article/728206 |journal=J19: The Journal of Nineteenth-Century Americanists |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=21–48 |doi=10.1353/jnc.2019.0001 |issn=2166-7438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Changing terminology ====

After abolition, ''negrophobia'' continued to be used to refer to anti-Black racism, but terms based on ''race'' also appeared around the turn of the 20th century. ''Racism'' first appeared in print in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;“Racism, N.” ''Oxford English Dictionary'', Oxford UP, July 2023, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1093/OED/1101660185&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1921, the terms ''negrophobia'' and ''race hatred'' were used to describe an outbreak of anti-Black violence in the [[Dominican Republic]] by John Sydney de Bourg, a spokesman for the local chapter of the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League|Universal Negro Improvement Association]] in [[San Pedro de Macorís]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wright |first=Micah |date=2015-04-03 |title=An Epidemic of Negrophobia: Blackness and the Legacy of the US Occupation of the Dominican Republic |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00064246.2015.1012994 |journal=The Black Scholar |language=en |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=21–33 |doi=10.1080/00064246.2015.1012994 |issn=0006-4246}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Negrophobia'' further reappeared in January 1927 in [[Lamine Senghor]]'s ''La voix des nègres'' (''The Voice of the Negroes''), a monthly [[Decolonization|anti-colonialist]] newspaper. The term became more widespread outside of North America and the English-speaking world when French Caribbean psychologist and philosopher [[Frantz Fanon]] included it in his works ''Peaux noires masques blancs'' (''[[Black Skin, White Masks]]'') and ''Les Damnés de la Terre'' (''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]''), again drawing on the rhetoric of racism as disease.&lt;ref name="une2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooks2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brooks |first1=Adia A. |date=2012 |title=Black Negrophobia and Black Self-Empowerment: Afro-Descendant Responses to Societal Racism in São Paulo, Brazil |url=https://www.uwlax.edu/globalassets/offices-services/urc/jur-online/pdf/2012/brooks.adia.pdf |journal=UW-L Journal of Undergraduate Research |volume=XV |page=2 |access-date=4 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a psychiatrist, Fanon explored ''negrophobia'' as an individual and societal "neurosis", although he saw it as the psychological structure underpinning colonial racism.&lt;ref&gt;Yokum, N. (2024). "A call for psycho-affective change: Fanon, feminism, and white negrophobic femininity." ''Philosophy &amp; Social Criticism'', 50(2), 343-368. https://doi.org/10.1177/01914537221103897&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Lee Bartky, ''Femininity and Domination: Studies in the Phenomenology of Oppression'' (New York: Routledge, 1990), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ann Doane, ‘Dark Continents: Epistemologies of Racial and Sexual Difference in Psychoanalysis and the Cinema’, in ''Femmes Fatales: Feminism, Film Theory, and Psychoanalysis'' (New York: Routledge, 2013/1991: 209–248), 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the 20th century, the term "Black" came to be preferred over "Negro", and so related terms became outdated.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;“Negro, N. &amp; Adj.” ''Oxford English Dictionary'', Oxford UP, March 2024, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1093/OED/2341880472&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''negrophobia'' is still sometimes used to distinguish anti-Black racism from racism more generally. In this sense, Negrophobia may mean an especially strong, violent or transmissible form of anti-Black racism. In France, ''Une Autre Histoire'' describes ''negrophobia'' as meaning "the most virulent form of racism targeting those who are perceived as 'blacks' by people considering themselves different from 'blacks'" (translation).&lt;ref name="une2"/&gt; Adia A. Brooks, who developed the Multidimensional Negrophobia Index (MNI) to measure anti-Black racism, describes it as a "[[Ideology|thought system, or ideology]]" and "the profound fear or hatred of black people and black culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Brooks |first=Adia A. |year=2012 |title=Black Negrophobia and Black Self-Empowerment: Afro-Descendant Responses to Societal Racism in São Paulo, Brazil |url=https://www.uwlax.edu/globalassets/offices-services/urc/jur-online/pdf/2012/brooks.adia.pdf |access-date=2024-07-03 |website=UW-L Journal of Undergraduate Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The psychology of anti-Black racism ===

Psychologists and sociologists have explored the individual and social psychology of anti-Black racism, often in reference to Fanon's work on ''negrophobia''. Jock McCulloch explores Fanon's conception from a psychodynamic perspective, arguing that negrophobia requires [[psychological projection]], and reveals "a certain psychic dependence of the European upon the black". He also points out that negrophobia, though it can be described as an emotional disorder, is theorised to come from the same "psychodynamic mechanism" as [[antisemitism]], and stresses the importance, in Fanon's account, of negrophobia as inherently racist and a product of colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;McCulloch, Jock (16 May 2002).

=== Internalised racism ===

Psychiatrist [[Frantz Fanon]] introduced the concept of [[Internalized racism|internalised racism]], or ''internalised negrophobia'', pointing to the hatred of Black people and Black culture [[Self-hatred|by Black people themselves]].&lt;ref name="Brooks" /&gt; He asserts that anti-Black sentiment is a form of "trauma for white people of the Negro".&lt;ref name="Alessandrini2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony C. Alessandrini|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6qGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA153|title=Frantz Fanon: Critical Perspectives|date=3 August 2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-65657-8|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equivalent to internalised racism caused by the trauma of living in a culture defining Black people as inherently evil, Fanon emphasises the slight existing cultural intricacies caused by the vast diversity of Black people and cultures, as well as the nature of their colonisation by White Europeans.&lt;ref name="Brooks" /&gt; The symptoms of such internalised anti-Black sentiment include a rejection of their native or ethnic language in favour of [[European languages]], a marked preference for [[Culture of Europe|European cultures]] over Black cultures, and a tendency to surround themselves with lighter-skinned people rather than darker-skinned ones.&lt;ref name="Brooks" /&gt;

Similarly, the pattern further includes attributing negative characteristics to Black people, culture, and things. [[Toni Morrison]]'s novel ''[[The Bluest Eye]]'' (1970) stands as an illustrative work on the destroying effects of anti-Black sentiment among the Black community on themselves.&lt;ref name="Blue"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maleki, Nasser and Haj'jari and Mohammad-Javad|date=2015|title=Negrophobia and Anti-Negritude in Morrison's The Bluest Eye|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291147460|journal=Epiphany: Journal of Transdisciplinary Studies|volume=8|page=69|access-date=7 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main character, Pecola Breedlove, through her non-reconciliation with her Black identity, her Black societal indifference, and her craving for symbolic blue eyes, presents all the signs of an internalised anti-Black sentiment.&lt;ref name="Blue" /&gt; She develops an anti-Black [[neurosis]] due to her feeling of non-existence both within the White and her own community.&lt;ref name="Blue" /&gt;

While the latter theoretical framework is academically debated, Fanon insists on the nature of anti-Black sentiment as a socio-diagnosis, thus characterising not individuals but rather entire societies and their patterns.&lt;ref name="Brooks" /&gt; Fanon thereby implies that anti-Black sentiment is a cross-disciplinary area of research, justifying that its analysis and understanding may not be confined to the [[psychological]] field.&lt;ref name="Brooks" /&gt;

=== Involuntary racism ===

In the book ''Negrophobia and Reasonable Racism'', legal scholar Jody David Armour describes the term ''Involuntary Negrophobia'' as the legal precedent of defendants using a victim's Blackness as justification for violent crimes against them.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Armour, Jody David (1997). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qfpg3.4 Negrophobia and Reasonable Racism: The Hidden Costs of Being Black in America]. NYU Press. JSTOR j.ctt9qfpg3. pp. 64–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, such arguments rest on the idea that racist revulsion and violence directed at Black people is an involuntary reaction, such as with PTSD, and thus not an intentional criminal act; or that it constitutes a form of self-defence based on their perception of the victim as a threat because of their Blackness. This approach focusses on the personal culpability of the individual defendant, and their state of mind. Armour critiques this view as equating anti-Black sentiment with [[insanity]] and allowing a person's racial fear to legally justify and even excuse violent behaviour.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Anti-Blackness in education and organisation studies===

In response to [[Black Lives Matter]] organising contemporary scholars of education, human resource development, and critical management studies have begun focusing on anti-Blackness in schools and places of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bell|first1=Myrtle P.|last2=Berry|first2=Daphne|last3=Leopold|first3=Joy|last4=Nkomo|first4=Stella|date=January 2021|title=Making Black Lives Matter in academia: A Black feminist call for collective action against anti-blackness in the academy|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gwao.12555|journal=Gender, Work &amp; Organization|volume=28|issue=S1|pages=39–57|doi=10.1111/gwao.12555|hdl=2263/85604 |s2cid=224844343 |issn=0968-6673|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bohonos |first1=Jeremy W |title=Workplace hate speech and rendering Black and Native lives as if they do not matter: A nightmarish autoethnography |journal=Organization |date=July 2023 |volume=30 |issue=4 |s2cid=236294224 |pages=605–623 |doi=10.1177/13505084211015379 |issn=1350-5084}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dumas|first=Michael J.|date=2016-01-02|title=Against the Dark: Antiblackness in Education Policy and Discourse|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00405841.2016.1116852|journal=Theory into Practice|volume=55|issue=1|pages=11–19|doi=10.1080/00405841.2016.1116852|s2cid=147252566 |issn=0040-5841}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Dumas|first1=Michael J.|last2=ross|first2=kihana miraya|date=April 2016|title="Be Real Black for Me": Imagining BlackCrit in Education|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0042085916628611|journal=Urban Education|volume=51|issue=4|pages=415–442|doi=10.1177/0042085916628611|s2cid=147319546 |issn=0042-0859}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bohonos|first1=Jeremy W.|last2=Sisco|first2=Stephanie|date=June 2021|title=Advocating for social justice, equity, and inclusion in the workplace: An agenda for anti-racist learning organizations|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ace.20428|journal=New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education|volume=2021|issue=170|pages=89–98|doi=10.1002/ace.20428|s2cid=240576110 |issn=1052-2891}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts build on established critical race discourses in their respective fields and incorporate concepts from [[Afro-pessimism (United States)|Afropessimism]].{{sfn|Wilderson|2021|p=}}{{page needed|date=March 2024}}

===== Cape Coloureds =====
[[Multiracial people|Mixed-race people]] in [[South Africa]] are referred to as [[Coloureds]] or [[Cape Coloureds]]. This term includes individuals with a mixed-race descent that can include [[List of ethnic groups of Africa|African]], [[Ethnic groups in Asia|Asian]], and [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] ethnic heritage.{{sfn|Kline Jr.|1958|p=8254}} The term "Coloured" is considered neutral in South African society and is commonly used to refer to individuals who self-identify as such.{{sfn|Stevenson|Waite|2011|p=283}} However, in some [[Western world|Western countries]], such as the [[Race and ethnicity in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] and the [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|United States]], the term "Coloured" has a negative connotation and can be seen as derogatory because it was historically used as a means of categorising Black individuals and reinforcing [[racial hierarchies]].&lt;ref name="news_BBCN"&gt;{{Cite web |date=9 November 2006 |title=Is the word 'coloured' offensive? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6132672.stm |access-date=5 June 2019 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word persists as a neutral descriptor in the names of some older organizations, such as the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in the United States.

The [[Demographics of South Africa#Earlier Censuses, 1904 to 2011|1911 South African census]] played a significant role in shaping the country's racial identities. The enumeration process involved specific instructions for classifying individuals into different racial categories, and the category of "Coloured persons" was used to refer to all people of mixed race. This included various ethnicities, such as [[Khoekhoe|Khoikhoi]], [[San people|San]], [[Cape Malays]], [[Griqua people|Griquas]], [[Khoemana|Korannas]], [[Creole peoples|Creoles]], [[Negroes]], and Cape Coloureds. What is particularly noteworthy about the classification of "Coloured persons" is that it included individuals of Black African descent, who were commonly known as Negroes. As a result, Coloureds or Cape Coloureds, as a group of mixed-race descent individuals, also have Black African ancestry and can be considered part of the broader [[African diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moultrie |first1=Tom A. |last2=Dorrington |first2=Rob E. |date=August 2012 |title=Used for ill; used for good: a century of collecting data on race in South Africa |journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies |volume=35 |issue=8 |pages=1447–1465 |doi=10.1080/01419870.2011.607502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The racial category of Coloureds is a multifaceted and heterogeneous group that exhibits great diversity. Analogously, they can be compared to [[African Americans|Black Americans]], whose population is composed of approximately 75% [[West Africa]]n and 25% [[Northern Europe]]an ancestry. However, the Cape Coloureds possess an even greater level of complexity due to the presence of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] ancestry in their [[genetic makeup]], which is closely linked to the predominantly West African heritage of Black Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Khan |first1=Razib |date=June 16, 2011 |title=The Cape Coloureds are a mix of everything |url=https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/the-cape-coloureds-are-a-mix-of-everything |access-date=March 2, 2023 |website=Discover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Christopher |first=A. J. |date=2002 |title='To Define the Indefinable': Population Classification and the Census in South Africa |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20004271 |journal=Area |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=401–408 |bibcode=2002Area...34..401C |doi=10.1111/1475-4762.00097 |issn=0004-0894 |jstor=20004271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Coloureds in South Africa do have Black African ancestry, it is important to recognize that they have a distinct identity and experiences that differ from those of Black South Africans. Despite this, there are instances where Coloureds may face discrimination and prejudice based on their mixed-race descent and Black African ancestry. Furthermore, some individuals who hold prejudiced attitudes towards Black people may also hold negative attitudes towards Coloureds, viewing them as inferior or less desirable due to their mixed-race heritage.

In Europe, anti-Black sentiment finds its roots in the 17th century due to its extensive historical [[colonisation]] and [[slavery]].&lt;ref name="une2"/&gt;

==== France ====
In 2005, an anti-negrophobia brigade (BAN) was created in France to protest against increasing numbers of targeted acts and occurrences of [[police violence]] against Black people.&lt;ref name="une2"/&gt; The latter protest movements notably underwent severe police violence in the Jardin du Luxembourg in Paris during the 2011 and 2013 abolition of slavery commemorations.&lt;ref name="une2"/&gt;

== Racism against non-African Black groups ==

Though ''anti-Black racism'' specifically refers to people of Black African descent, there are other groups who are identified as [[Black people|Black]] and whose experiences of racism may share similarities to those of Black Africans.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; These groups include Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders) and Melanesians.
