Transphobia can have consequences as severe as homophobia for the targeted person. Transgender people are often targets of [[harassment]], [[assault]], and [[murder]], ranging from random attacks to [[rescue worker]]s who discover a transgendered accident victim's [[birth gender]] and withhold service until the person dies.

Although the word transphobia is widely used, the phenomenon is more of a [[paranoia]] than a [[phobia]].

Two noted victims of transphobia were [[Brandon Teena]] and [[Gwen Araujo]].
