{{Status of religious freedom|persecution}}
{{Discrimination sidebar}}
[[Neopaganism|Neopagans]] are a [[religious minority]] in every country where they exist&lt;ref&gt;Consistently below 0.5%. Estimated ratios may approach 0.4% in [[Religion in Iceland|Iceland]] and the [[Religion in the United Kingdom|UK]]. In the USA and Canada, Neopagans account for an estimated 0.2% of the population.&lt;/ref&gt; and have been subject to [[religious discrimination]] and/or [[religious persecution]]. The largest Neopagan communities are in North America and the United Kingdom, and the issue of discrimination receives most attention in those locations, but there are also reports from Australia and [[Greece]] (the latter specifically concerning [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenic Neopaganism]]).

In 2003, Olivia Watts charged the mayor of the [[City of Casey]], Victoria, Rob Wilson, as violating the [[Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001]] after he issued a press release in June of that year titled "Satanic cult out to take over Casey", in which Watts was mentioned by name. During a hearing on August 12, 2004 in the [[Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal]], Watts said that after the press release, she suffered vandalism to her property and an assault at her home, in addition to general "hatred, contempt and revulsion". On August 13, it was revealed in tribunal that the matter had been settled overnight, and Wilson read a statement acknowledging that Watts was not a Satanist and expressing "regret for any hurt felt by Ms Watts in consequence of his press release".&lt;ref name="age224"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/08/12/1092102595224.html |title=Tribunal hears claims of Satanic cult |work=The Age |first=Jamie |last=Berry |date=2004-08-13 |accessdate=2007-08-01 |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ss279"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.saltshakers.org.au/html/P/20/B/279/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20041013135047/http://www.saltshakers.org.au/html/P/20/B/279/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2004-10-13 |title=Rob Wilson VCAT case&amp;nbsp;— statement |work=Salt Shakers |first=Jenny |last=Stokes |date=2004-08-14 |accessdate=2007-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greece==
{{Main|Hellenism (religion)|Religion in Greece}}
In [[Separation of church and state#Greece|modern day Greece]], the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] has the status of [[state religion]], and consequently, alternative religions such as [[Hellenic Neopaganism]] may be subject to discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/05/08/wgods08.xml |title=The Telegraph: Modern Athenians fight for the right to worship the ancient Greek gods |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=2010-05-22 |first=Charles |last=Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Greek Society of Attic Friends'', which states that it has 40,000 members, has been unsuccessful when they asked for recognition as a legal religion and was denied the right to build a temple in [[Athens]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.widdershins.org/vol10iss4/09.htm |title=Ongoing Persecution of Pagans in Modern Greece}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to use existing temples for worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/travel/modern-pagans-worship-illegally-in-athens/2007/01/22/1169330798194.html |title=The Age: Modern pagans worship illegally in Athens |location=Melbourne |date=2007-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, there have been occasional clashes between [[New Age travellers]] and authorities, such as the [[Battle of the Beanfield]] in 1985. There are also occasional charges of harassment against Neopagans such as the following examples:

In 1999, Dr Ralph Morse was appointed by the [[Pagan Federation]] as their first national youth manager. Following an article that appeared in the ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'' on April 2, 2000, Morse was summarily suspended from his post as Head of Drama, Theatre Arts and Media Studies at Shenfield High School in Essex.&lt;ref&gt;''Independent on Sunday'' articles dated April 2 and 9, 2000 and The Foundation for Religious Freedom responding comment; CNS News Coverage (Foreign Bureaus)&lt;/ref&gt; Morse was subsequently fully investigated by the school and reinstated with a full retraction released to the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=New Religious Movements in the 21st Century |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |first=Phillip Charles |last=Lucas |author2=Robbins, Thomas |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-415-96576-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Paganism in World Cultures: Comparative Perspectives |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=[[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] |first=Michael F |last=Strmiska |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-85109-608-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, members of "[[Youth 2000]]", a conservative Catholic organisation, on visit to Father Kevin Knox-Lecky of St Mary's church, [[Glastonbury]], attacked pagans by throwing salt at them and told them they "would burn in hell". Knox-Lecky apologised and said he would not invite the group again.

[[United States Army Chaplain Corps|U.S. Army Chaplain]] Captain Don Larsen was dismissed from his post in [[Iraq]] in 2006 after changing his religious affiliation from [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal Christianity]] to Wicca and applying to become the first Wiccan military chaplain. His potential new endorser, the Sacred Well Congregation based in Texas, was not yet an officially recognised endorsement organisation for the military, and upon hearing of his conversion, his prior endorser, the Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches, immediately revoked its endorsement.

===In prisons===
{{Further|Prisons in the United States|Religion in the United States' prisons|Dettmer v. Landon|Cutter v. Wilkinson|Wisconsin witch hunt}}
The 1985, Virginia prisoner Herbert Daniel Dettmer sued Robert Landon, the Director of the [[Virginia Department of Corrections]], in federal court, to get access to objects he claimed were necessary for his Wiccan religious practice. The [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia|district court for the Eastern District of Virginia]] decided in Dettmer's favor, although on appeal the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] ruled that, while Wicca was a religion, he was not being discriminated against. This case marked the first legal recognition of Wicca as a religion.

In Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709 (2005), a case involving five Ohio prison inmates (two followers of [[Ásatrú]], a minister of the [[Church of Jesus Christ Christian]], a [[Wicca]]n witch and a [[Satanist]]) protesting denial of access to ceremonial items and opportunities for group worship was brought before the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="select.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60916FC355F0C708DDDA90994DC404482&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fS%2fSupreme%20Court%20 |title=NY Times: Justices Will Hear 2 Church-State Cases |work=The New York Times |first=Linda |last=Greenhouse |date=2004-10-13 |accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the denied objects was instructions for runic writing requested by an Ásatrúarmaður, which was initially denied when prison officials raised concerns that runic writing could be used for coded gang communication.

In an interview about the role of race-based [[gang]]s and other extremists in America's prisons, the historian [[Mark Pitcavage]] came to the conclusion that "[n]''on-racist versions of Ásatrú and [[Odinism]] are pretty much acceptable religions in the prisons''",&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Mark Pitcavage – [http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=55 Behind the Walls] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713233401/http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=55 |date=July 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but materials from racist variants of these religions may be prohibited by corrections departments.

In early 2011, a Stillwater prisoner named Stephen Hodgson filed a federal lawsuit against the state of Minnesota claiming his religious rights have been violated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startribune.com/local/east/119516524.html Wiccan Prisoner sues State] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413163120/http://www.startribune.com/local/east/119516524.html |date=April 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hodgson claimed he was prohibited from practising his Wiccan faith when guards and prison administrators refused to allow him to use prayer oils and herbs needed. He also claimed that his religious mail had been confiscated and that he had been prohibited from burning incense or using prayer oils and herbs. He claimed those items were necessary for the practice of his religion and that they posed no danger to guards or other inmates.  The Minnesota Department of Human Rights agreed with Hodgson, saying "probable cause exists to believe that an unfair discriminatory practice was committed."

The discrimination case is awaiting trial.

===Wicca===
According to [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], who popularised [[Wicca]] in the twentieth century, the religion is a survival of a European witch-cult that was persecuted during the [[witch trials]] (sometimes called the ''[[Witch-hunt#The Burning Times|Burning Times]]''), and the strong element of secrecy that traditionally surrounds the religion was adopted as a reaction to that persecution. Since then, [[Margaret Murray]]'s theory of an organised pan-European witch-cult has been discredited, and doubts raised about the age of Wicca; many Wiccans no longer claim this historical lineage. However, it is still common for Wiccans to feel solidarity with the victims of the witch trials and, being witches, to consider the witch-craze to have been a persecution against their faith.&lt;ref name="WitchcraftInside"&gt;{{cite book |title=Witchcraft From The Inside: Origins of the Fastest Growing Religious Movement in America |first=Raymond |last=Buckland |authorlink=Raymond Buckland |publisher=Llewellyn Publications |location=St. Paul, MN |date=2002-09-01 |origyear=1971 |edition=3rd |isbn=978-1-56718-101-2 |oclc=31781774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been confusion that Wicca is a form of [[Theistic Satanism|Satanism]], despite important differences between these religions.&lt;ref name="Davis2003"&gt;{{cite book |title=New Religious Movements and Religious Liberty in America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=up5fnY7Wp1wC&amp;pg=PA75 |publisher=Baylor University Press |location=[[Waco, Texas|Waco]] |author1=Davis, Derek |author2=Hankins, Barry |edition=2nd |year=2003 |pages=75 |isbn=978-0-918954-92-3 |oclc=52895492 |quote=Much to the chagrin of practitioners of Wicca, there has been confusion in the minds of many about their religion, which is often linked with Satanism, although there are important differences.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to negative connotations associated with witchcraft, many Wiccans continue the traditional practice of secrecy, concealing their faith for fear of persecution. Revealing oneself as Wiccan to family, friends, or colleagues is often termed "coming out of the broom-closet".&lt;ref name="slate031204"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2090966/ |title=Witch Way |work=Slate.com |author='Bewitched' |date=2003-12-04 |accessdate=2008-05-16 |quote=Believe me, coming out of the "broom closet" is a one-way trip.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiccans have also experienced difficulties in administering and receiving prison ministry, although not in the UK of recent times.&lt;ref name="hmprison"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psi.hmprisonservice.gov.uk/PSI_2005_33_paganism.doc |title=Practice of Paganism in Prison |work=HM Prison Service |first=Michael |last=Spurr |date=2005-08-31 |accessdate=2007-07-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017113544/http://psi.hmprisonservice.gov.uk/PSI_2005_33_paganism.doc |archivedate=October 17, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, as a result of ''[[Dettmer v. Landon]]'' [617 F. Supp. 592 (D.C. Va 1985)], the District Court of [[Virginia]] ruled that Wicca is a legally recognised religion and is afforded all the benefits accorded to it by law. This was affirmed a year later by Judge [[John D. Butzner, Jr.]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] [''Dettmer v. Landon'', 799 F. 2d 929 (4th Cir. 1986)]. Nevertheless, Wiccans are sometimes still stigmatised in America, and many remain secretive about their beliefs.

Also in 1985, conservative legislators in the United States introduced three pieces of legislation designed to take away the tax-exempt status of Wiccans. The first one was House Resolution (H.R.) 3389, introduced on September 19, 1985 by Congressman [[Robert Smith Walker|Robert S. Walker]] (R-Pennsylvania), which would have amended to the United States [[Internal Revenue Code]] that any organisation which promotes witchcraft would not be exempt from taxation. On the other side of Congress, Senator [[Jesse Helms]] (R-North Carolina ) added Amendment 705 to H.R. 3036, "The Treasury, Postal, and General Government Appropriations Bill for 1986", which similarly stated that organisations promoting witchcraft would not be eligible for tax-exempt status. After being ignored for a time, it was attached to H.R. 3036 by a unanimous voice vote of the senators. Congressman [[Richard T. Schulze]] (R-Pennsylvania) introduced substantially the same amendment to the Tax Reform Bill of 1985. When the budget subcommittee met on October 30, the Helms Amendment was thrown out as it was not considered germane to the bill. Following this, Schulze withdrew his amendment from the Tax Reform Bill, leaving only H.R. 3389, the Walker Bill. [[Joe Barton]] (R-Texas) was attracted to become a co-sponsor of this bill on November 14, 1985. The [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means Committee]] set aside the bill and quietly ignored it, and the bill was allowed to die with the close of the [[Ninety-ninth United States Congress|99th session of Congress]] in December 1986.&lt;ref name="99thCongress"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soamc.dynu.com/tfh/FILES/Cults,%20Occult,%20Mysticism/Info%20on%20pagan%20rituals%20&amp;%20other%20info/index18.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311074100/http://soamc.dynu.com/tfh/FILES/Cults%2C%20Occult%2C%20Mysticism/Info%20on%20pagan%20rituals%20%26%20other%20info/index18.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 11, 2007 |title=Witch Busters: A Summary of Anti-Witchcraft Activity in the 99th Congress |work=soamc.dynu.com/tfh |accessdate=2007-07-11 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WitchesMedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/58/story_5812_2.html |title=Witches, Pagans, and the Media |work=Beliefnet.com |first=Margot |last=Adler |accessdate=2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Cynthia Simpson of [[Chesterfield County, Virginia]], submitted an application to be invited to lead prayer at the local Board of Supervisors meetings, but in a response was told that because the views of Wicca were not "consistent with the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition", her application had been denied. After the Board reviewed and affirmed their policy, Simpson took the case to the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia|U.S. District Court of Virginia]], which held that the Board had violated the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] by advancing limited sets of beliefs.&lt;ref name="simpedva"&gt;''[http://www.acluva.org/docket/pleadings/simpson_edvaopinion.pdf Simpson v.

Va. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The Board appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals]], which in 2005 reversed the ruling and held that the Supreme Court's holding in the [[Marsh v. Chambers|''Marsh'' case]] meant that "Chesterfield County could constitutionally exclude Simpson from leading its legislative prayers, because her faith was not 'in the Judeo-Christian tradition.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Simpson v.

===Ásatrú===
{{Further|Ásatrú in the United States}}
The United States government does not officially endorse or recognise any religious group, and numerous Ásatrú groups have been granted [[Non-profit corporation|non-profit religious status]], like other religious faiths, going back to the 1970s.&lt;ref name= "Well of Mimir"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Linzie, Bil |title=Drinking at the Well of Mimir |year=2000 |url=http://ragngautr-kindred.org/library/modern/drinking-at-the-well-of-mimir.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616085928/http://ragngautr-kindred.org/library/modern/drinking-at-the-well-of-mimir.pdf |archive-date=June 16, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An inmate of the "Intensive Management Unit" at [[Washington State Penitentiary]] alleges that adherents of Ásatrú in 2001 were deprived of their [[Mjolnir|Thor's Hammer]] medallions as well as denied religious literature, as well as complaints against the prison chaplain calling Ásatrú "'devil worship,' etc."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prisonerlife.com/articles/articleID=3.cfm Walla Walla's Suppression of Religious Freedom]{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a federal judge confirmed that Ásatrú adherents in US prisons have the right to possess a Thor's Hammer pendant. An inmate sued the Virginia Department of Corrections after he was denied it while members of other religions were allowed their medallions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=18629 |title=First Amendment Center: Va. inmate can challenge denial of Thor's Hammer |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030054005/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=18629 |archivedate=October 30, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Georgacarakos v. Watts case Peter N. Georgacarakos filed a pro se civil-rights complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against 19 prison officials for "interference with the free exercise of his Asatru religion" and "discrimination on the basis of his being Asatru".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kscourts.org/CA10/cases/2005/08/05-1180.htm |title=Georgacarakos v.

The [[Cutter v. Wilkinson]] case was partially about an adherent of Ásatrú being denied access to ceremonial items and opportunities for group worship.&lt;ref name="select.nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/breaking/story.asp?ID=3679 |title=Spokesman Review: Sweet air of religious freedom could turn sour |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926214535/http://www.spokesmanreview.com/breaking/story.asp?ID=3679 |archivedate=September 26, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The defendants on numerous occasions refused to answer or respond to letters, complaints, and requests for Ásatrú religious accommodations. They also refused to respond to complaints of religious discrimination. Ásatrú inmates were denied group worship and/or group study time as they did to other religions. They refused to hire a [[Gothi]] to perform [[blót]]s while providing priests for members of other religions. The Ásatrú inmates were also denied the right to have their own worship or study services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jus.state.nc.us/NCJA/07idetlegalport.doc |title=Portions of the Ásatrú Complaint |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127015802/http://www.jus.state.nc.us/NCJA/07idetlegalport.doc |archivedate=November 27, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a join press release the [[Odinic Rite]], [[Ásatrú Alliance]] and [[Ásatrú Folk Assembly]] charged the [[FBI]] with violating its [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights to [[freedom of religion]], [[free speech]], and peaceful assembly by giving "False, misleading and deceptive information about our religion and its followers" in FBI's [[Project Megiddo]] report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cesnur.org/testi/FBI_007.htm |title=CESNUR&amp;nbsp;— Updates on FBI and Project Megiddo, November 10, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anti-Defamation League]] publishes lists of [[fascist symbolism|symbols]] used by anti-Semitic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/hate_symbols/ |title=Hate On Display: A Visual Database of Extremist Symbols, Logos and Tattoos |publisher=ADL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included in these publications are several [[Germanic paganism|Germanic pagan]] symbols that were sometimes used by the Nazis and some neo-Nazi groups, but have also always been used by non-racist pagan religions. Following an organised e-mail protest (mainly by the [[Odinic Rite]]), the ADL clarified that these symbols are not necessarily racist. It has since amended its publications to categorise these symbols as "pagan symbols co-opted by extremists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/hate_symbols/Pagan_graphics.asp |title=Hate On Display: A Visual Database of Extremist Symbols, Logos and Tattoos |publisher=ADL |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012032036/http://www.adl.org/hate_symbols/Pagan_graphics.asp |archivedate=October 12, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
