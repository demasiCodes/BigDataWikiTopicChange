'''Sexism''' or '''gender discrimination''' is [[prejudice]] against or [[discrimination]] based on a person's [[Sex and gender|sex or gender]]. Sexism can affect any gender, but it is particularly documented as affecting women and girls.&lt;!--NOTE: Consensus among WP:Reliable sources, assessed via WP:Due weight, is that sexism is typically against women. Before removing this text, raise the issue on the talk page first.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Sexism"&gt;There is a clear and broad consensus among academic scholars in multiple fields that sexism refers primarily to discrimination against women, and primarily affects women. See, for example:
*{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=New Oxford American Dictionary |title=Sexism |access-date= |edition=3 |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199891535}} Defines sexism as "prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex."
*{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica, Online Academic Edition |year=2015}} Defines sexism as "prejudice or discrimination based on sex or gender, especially against women and girls." Notes that "sexism in a society is most commonly applied against women and girls.  It functions to maintain patriarchy, or male domination, through ideological and material practices of individuals, collectives, and institutions that oppress women and girls on the basis of sex or gender."
*{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Cudd|first1=Ann E.|last2=Jones|first2=Leslie E.|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=A Companion to Applied Ethics |year=2005 |publisher=Blackwell |location=London}} Notes that "'Sexism' refers to a historically and globally pervasive form of oppression against women."
*{{cite encyclopedia |last=Masequesmay|first=Gina|editor-last=O'Brien|editor-first=Jodi|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Gender and Society |year=2008 |publisher=SAGE}} Notes that "sexism usually refers to prejudice or discrimination based on sex or gender, especially against women and girls." Also states that "sexism is an ideology or practices that maintain patriarchy or male domination." 
*{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hornsby |first=Jennifer|editor-last=Honderich|editor-first=Ted|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |edition=2 |year=2005|publisher=Oxford}} Defines sexism as "thought or practice which may permeate language and which assume's women's inferiority to men."
*{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Collins Dictionary of Sociology  |year=2006 |publisher=Harper Collins}} Defines sexism as "any devaluation or denigration of women or men, but particularly women, which is embodied in institutions and social relationships."
*{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Palgrave MacMillan Dictionary of Political Thought |year=2007 |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan}} Notes that "either sex may be the object of sexist attitudes... however, it is commonly held that, in developed societies, women have been the usual victims."
*{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Love, Courtship, and Sexuality through History, Volume 6: The Modern World |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood}} "Sexism is any act, attitude, or institutional configuration that systematically subordinates or devalues women.  Built upon the belief that men and women are constitutionally different, sexism takes these differences as indications that men are inherently superior to women, which then is used to justify the nearly universal dominance of men in social and familial relationships, as well as politics, religion, language, law, and economics."

== Etymology and definitions ==
According to [[Fred R. Shapiro]], the term "sexism" was most likely coined on November 18, 1965, by Pauline M. Leet during a "Student-Faculty Forum" at [[Franklin and Marshall College]].&lt;ref name="wordpress2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2007/10/19/feminism-friday-the-origins-of-the-word-sexism/ |title=Feminism Friday: The origins of the word "sexism" |work=Finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com |date=October 19, 2007 |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siegel|first1=Daniel J.|title=The Wise Legacy: How One Professor Transformed the Nation|date=February 16, 2015|publisher=CreateSpace|isbn=9781507625590|page=54|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hjbGBgAAQBAJ|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the word sexism appears in Leet's forum contribution "Women and the Undergraduate", and she defines it by comparing it to racism, stating in part (on page 3): "When you argue ... that since fewer women write good poetry this justifies their total exclusion, you are taking a position analogous to that of the racist—I might call you in this case a 'sexist' ... Both the racist and the sexist are acting as if all that has happened had never happened, and both of them are making decisions and coming to conclusions about someone’s value by referring to factors which are in both cases irrelevant."&lt;ref name="wordpress2007"/&gt;

Also according to Shapiro, the first time the term "sexism" appeared in print was in [[Caroline Bird (American author)|Caroline Bird]]'s speech "On Being Born Female", which was published on November 15, 1968, in ''Vital Speeches of the Day'' (p.&amp;nbsp;6).&lt;ref name="wordpress2007"/&gt; In this speech she said in part: "There is recognition abroad that we are in many ways a sexist country. Sexism is judging people by their sex when sex doesn't matter. Sexism is intended to rhyme with racism."&lt;ref name="wordpress2007"/&gt;

Sexism is discrimination, prejudice, or stereotyping on the basis of gender. Sexism is most often expressed toward girls and women.&lt;ref name="Sexism"/&gt; It has been characterized as the "hatred of women" and "entrenched prejudice against women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PM's sexism rant prompts Australian dictionary rewrite |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/19/world/asia/australia-macquarie-misogyny/|publisher=CNN|date=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Women in ancient Rome]] could not vote or hold [[Roman magistrate|political office]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce W. Frier and Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'' (Oxford University Press: American Philological Association, 2004), pp. 31–32, 457, ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Witch hunts and trials ===
{{Main article|Witch hunt}}
[[File:Malleus.jpg|thumb|Title page of the seventh [[Cologne]] edition of the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'', 1520 (from the [[University of Sydney Library]]). The Latin title is "''MALLEUS MALEFICARUM, Maleficas, &amp; earum hæresim, ut phramea potentissima conterens''". (Generally translated into English as ''The Hammer of Witches which destroyeth Witches and their heresy as with a two-edged sword'').&lt;ref&gt;The English translation is from [http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/notes/n192863.html this note] to [http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/mm00c7.html Summers' 1928 introduction].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Sexism may have been the impetus that fueled the witch trials between the 15th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 01.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[early modern Europe]] and in the European colonies in North America claims were made that [[witchcraft|witches]] were a threat to [[Christendom]]. The [[misogyny]] of that period played a role in the persecution of these women.&lt;ref&gt;Barstow, Anne Llewellyn (1994) ''Witchcraze: A New History of the European Witch Hunts'' San Francisco: Pandora.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. pp. 42-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Malleus Malificarum]]'', the book which played a major role in the witch hunts and trials, the authors argue that women are more likely to practice witchcraft than men, and write that:

: All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman&amp;nbsp;... What else is woman but a foe to friendship, an inescapable punishment, a necessary evil, a natural temptation, a desirable calamity, a domestic danger, a delectable detriment, an evil of nature, painted with fair colours!&lt;ref&gt;Kramer and Sprenger. Malleus Malificarum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Witchcraft remains illegal in several countries, including [[Saudi Arabia]], where it is [[punishable by death]]. In 2011 a woman was beheaded in that country for 'witchcraft and sorcery'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/13/world/meast/saudi-arabia-beheading/ | work=CNN | title=Saudi woman beheaded for 'witchcraft and sorcery' - CNN.com | date=December 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murders of women after being accused of witchcraft remain common in some parts of the world; for example, in [[Tanzania]], about 500 elderly women are murdered each year following such accusations.&lt;ref&gt;The World Health Organization. World report on violence and health: Chapter 5 abuse of the elderly Retrieved 17 April 2015 from http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/global_campaign/en/chap5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

When women are targeted for accusations of witchcraft and subsequent violence, it is often the case that several forms of discrimination interact - for example discrimination based on gender with discrimination based on [[caste]], as is the case in India and Nepal, where such crimes are relatively common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/7241937/Witch-hunts-of-low-caste-women-in-Nepal.html|title=Witch-hunts of low-caste women in Nepal|first=By Deepesh Shrestha, in Pyutar for|last=AFP|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/witch-hunting-india-poor-low-caste-widows-main-targets-1457809|title=Witch Hunting in India: Poor, Low Caste and Widows Main Targets|first=Ludovica|last=Iaccino|date=22 July 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.academicjournals.org/journal/IJSA/article-full-text-pdf/E405B8747740&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 20th century, U.S. and [[English law]] observed the system of [[coverture]], where "by marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law; that is the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage".&lt;ref name="blackstone"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/xblack.htm | title=Extracts from William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England 1765-1769 | accessdate=15 March 2015 | author=Blackstone, William | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005032946/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/xblack.htm | archive-date=5 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. women were not legally defined as "persons" until 1875 (''[[Minor v.

Women in parts of the world continue to lose legal rights at marriage.

Abuses and discriminatory practices against women in marriage are often rooted in financial payments such as [[dowry]], [[bride price]], and [[dower]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2012/12/unw-legislation-supplement-en%20pdf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These transactions often serve as legitimizing [[coercive control]] of the wife by her husband and in giving him authority over her; for instance Article 13 of the [[Code of Personal Status (Tunisia)]] states that "The husband shall not, in default of payment of the [[dower]], force the woman to consummate the marriage",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4322925|title=The Tunisian Code of Personal Status (Majallat Al-Ahw Al Al-Shakhsiy Ah)|first=George N.|last=Sfeir|date=1 January 1957|publisher=|journal=Middle East Journal|volume=11|issue=3|pages=309–318|via=|doi=10.2307/4322925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Article 13 reads in French: "Le mari ne peut, s'il n'a pas acquitté la dot, contraindre la femme à la consommation du mariage" http://www.jurisitetunisie.com/tunisie/codes/csp/Csp1015.htm&lt;/ref&gt; implying that, if the dower is paid, [[marital rape]] is permitted (in this regard, critics have questioned the alleged gains of women in [[Tunisia]], and its image as a progressive country in the region, arguing that discrimination against women remains very strong in that country).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffpostmaghreb.com/2013/08/13/raisons-hommes-femmes-csp_n_3747952.html|title=7 raisons pour les hommes et les femmes de remettre en cause le CSP... ou pas|work=Al Huffington Post|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letemps.com.tn/article/83765/nouveaux-progr%C3%A8s-mais-il-ne-faut-pas-pour-autant-pavoiser|title=Nouveaux progrès, mais il ne faut pas pour autant pavoiser|work=Le Temps|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fidh.org/La-Federation-internationale-des-ligues-des-droits-de-l-homme/maghreb-moyen-orient/tunisie/15424-les-violences-sexuelles-en-tunisie-apres-le-deni-un-debut-de|title=Les violences sexuelles en Tunisie : après le déni, un début de (...)|author=FIDH|work=FIDH - Worldwide Human Rights Movement|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws, regulations, and traditions related to marriage continue to discriminate against women in many parts of the world, and to contribute to the mistreatment of women, in particular in areas related to [[sexual violence]] and to self-determination in regard to [[sexuality]], the violation of the latter now being acknowledged as a violation of [[women's rights]]; in 2012, [[Navi Pillay]], then [[High Commissioner for Human Rights]], has stated that:

:"Women are frequently treated as property, they are sold into marriage, into trafficking, into sexual slavery. Violence against women frequently takes the form of sexual violence. Victims of such violence are often accused of promiscuity and held responsible for their fate, while infertile women are rejected by husbands, families and communities. In many countries, married women may not refuse to have sexual relations with their husbands, and often have no say in whether they use contraception (...) Ensuring that women have full autonomy over their bodies is the first crucial step towards achieving substantive equality between women and men. Personal issues—such as when, how and with whom they choose to have sex, and when, how and with whom they choose to have children—are at the heart of living a life in dignity."&lt;ref&gt;Pillay, N.

=== Suffrage and politics ===
[[File:Annie Kenney and Christabel Pankhurst.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Annie Kenney]] and [[Christabel Pankhurst]].]]

Gender has been used, at times, as a tool for discrimination against women in the political sphere. [[Women's suffrage]] was not achieved until 1893, when New Zealand was the first country to grant women the right to vote. Saudi Arabia was the most recent country, as of August 2015, to extend the right to vote to women in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline of Women’s Suffrage Granted, by Country|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0931343.html|publisher=Infoplease|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Western countries allowed women the right to vote only relatively recently: [[Switzerland|Swiss]] women gained the right to vote in federal elections in 1971,&lt;ref name="switzerland-chronology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html |title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology |publisher=History-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] became the last [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] to grant women the right to vote on local issues (in 1991, when it was forced to do so by the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/WOM1373.doc.htm |title=United Nations press release of a meeting of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), issued on 14 January 2003 |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; French women were granted the right to vote in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Pierre Maury |url=http://mjp.univ-perp.fr/france/co1944-2.htm |title=Ordonnance du 21 avril 1944 relative à l'organisation des pouvoirs publics en France après la Libération |publisher=Mjp.univ-perp.fr |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/femmes/citoyennete_politique_de-Gaulle.asp |title=La citoyenneté politique des femmes&amp;nbsp;– La décision du Général de Gaulle |author=Assemblée nationale |accessdate=2007-12-19 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greece, women obtained the right to vote in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.db-decision.de/CoRe/Greece.htm|title=European Database: Women in Decision-making - Country Report Greece|author=Kerstin Teske: teske@fczb.de|work=db-decision.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Liechtenstein]], women obtained the right to vote in 1984, through the [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1984|women's suffrage referendum of 1984]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1066106.stm|title=BBC News - Timeline: Liechtenstein|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/02/world/around-the-world-liechtenstein-women-win-right-to-vote.html|title=Liechtenstein Women Win Right to Vote|date=2 July 1984|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While almost every woman today has the right to vote, there is still progress to be made for women in politics. Studies have shown that in several democracies including Australia, Canada and the United States, women are still represented using gender stereotypes in the press &lt;ref name="KittilsonFridkin2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kittilson|first1=Miki Caul|last2=Fridkin|first2=Kim|title=Gender, Candidate Portrayals and Election Campaigns: A Comparative Perspective|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=4|issue=03|year=2008|issn=1743-923X|doi=10.1017/S1743923X08000330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple authors have shown that gender differences in the media are less evident today than they used to be in the 1980s, but are nonetheless still present. Certain issues (e.g., education) are likely to be linked with female candidates, while other issues (e.g., taxes) are likely to be linked with male candidates.&lt;ref name="KittilsonFridkin2008"/&gt; In addition, there is more emphasis on female candidates' personal qualities, such as their appearance and their personality, as females are portrayed as emotional and dependent.&lt;ref name="KittilsonFridkin2008"/&gt;

Sexism in politics can also be shown in the imbalance of law making power between men and women. Lanyan Chen asserts that men hold more political power than women, serving as the gatekeepers of policy making. It is possible that this leads to women's needs not being properly represented. In this sense, the inequality of law making power also causes the gender discrimination in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen|first=Lanyan|title=The Gendered Reality of Migrant Workers in Globalizing China|date=2009|publisher=The University of Ottawa|location=Ottawa|isbn=978-0-7766-0709-2|pages=186–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio of women to men in legislatures is used as a measure of gender equality in the [[United Nations|UN]] created [[Gender Empowerment Measure]] and its newer incarnation the [[Gender Inequality Index]].

Gender stereotypes are widely held beliefs about the characteristics and behavior of women and men.&lt;ref&gt;Manstead, A. S. R.; Hewstone, Miles; et al. ''The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Social Psychology''. Oxford, UK; Cambridge, Mass., USA: Blackwell, 1999, 1995, pp. 256 &amp;ndash; 57, ISBN 978-0-631-22774-8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empirical]] studies have found widely shared cultural beliefs that men are more socially valued and more competent than women in a number of activities.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, David G. and Joseph Berger (1997). ''Gender and Interpersonal Task Behaviors: Status Expectation Accounts.'' Sociological Perspectives, Vol. 40, No. 1, pp. 1-32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, John E. and Deborah L. Best. ''Measuring Sex Stereotypes: A Multinational Study.'' Newbury Park, CA: Sage, 1990, ISBN 978-0-8039-3815-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Dustin B. Thoman and others (2008) hypothesize that "[t]he socio-cultural salience of ability versus other components of the gender-math stereotype may impact women pursuing math". Through the experiment comparing the math outcomes of women under two various gender-math stereotype components, which are the ability of math and the effort on math respectively, Thoman and others found that women’s math performance is more likely to be affected by the negative ability stereotype, which is influenced by sociocultural beliefs in the United States, rather than the effort component. As a result of this experiment and the sociocultural beliefs in the United States, Thoman and others concluded that individuals' academic outcomes can be affected by the gender-math stereotype component that is influenced by the sociocultural beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Thoman, Dustin B., Paul H. White, Niwako Yamawaki, and Hirofumi Koishi. "Variations of Gender–math Stereotype Content Affect Women’s Vulnerability to Stereotype Threat." Sex Roles 58.9-10 (2008): 702-12. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[World Values Survey]]'', responders were asked if they thought that wage work should be restricted to only men in the case of shortage in jobs. While in Iceland the proportion that agreed was 3.6%, in Egypt it was 94.9%.&lt;ref&gt;Fortin, Nicole, "Gender Role Attitudes and the Labour Market Outcomes of Women Across OECD Countries", Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 2005, 21, 416–438.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people believe a phenomenon known as [[stereotype threat]] can lower women's performance on mathematics tests, creating a self-fulfilling stereotype of women having inferior quantitative skills compared to men.&lt;ref&gt;Shih, Margaret, Todd L. Pittinsky and Nalini Ambady (1999).

These "biased self-assessments" have far-reaching effects, because they can shape men and women's educational and career decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Correll, Shelley J. (2001).

Examples include:

*The use of generic masculine terms to reference a group of mixed gender, such as "mankind", "man" (referring to humanity), "guys", or "officers and men"
*The use of the singular masculine pronoun (he, his, him) as the default to refer to a person of unknown gender 
*Terms ending in "-man" that may be performed by those of non-male genders, such as businessman, chairman, or policeman
*The ordering of words in phrases like "man and wife"
*The use of unnecessary gender markers, such as "male nurse" implying that simply a "nurse" is by default assumed to be female.&lt;ref name="Kennison &amp; Trofe 2002"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Kennison| first1=S. |last2=Trofe |first2=J. |title=Comprehending Pronouns: A Role for Word-Specific Gender Stereotype Information |journal=Journal of Psycholinguistic Research| volume=32| issue=3| year=2003| pages=355–378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexist and gender-neutral language ===
{{See also|Gender-neutral language}}
Various feminist movements in the 20th century, from [[liberal feminism]] and [[radical feminism]] to [[standpoint feminism]], [[postmodern feminism]] and [[queer theory]] have all considered language in their theorizing.&lt;ref&gt;Mille, Katherine Wyly and Paul McIlvenny. "Gender and Spoken Interaction: A Survey of Feminist Theories and Sociolinguistic Research in the United States and Britain." http://paul-server.hum.aau.dk/research/cv/Pubs/mille-mcilvenny.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these theories have maintained a critical stance on language that calls for a change in the way speakers use their language.

One of the most common calls is for gender-neutral language. Many have called attention, however, to the fact that the English language isn't inherently sexist in its linguistic system, but rather the way it is used becomes sexist and gender-neutral language could thus be employed.&lt;ref&gt;Ruthven, K.K. "Feminist literary studies: an introduction." http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam034/90034404.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, other opposed critiques of sexism in language with explanations that language is a descriptive, rather than prescriptive, and attempts to control it can be fruitless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friesian.com/language.htm |title=Against the Theory of "Sexist Language" |publisher=Friesian.com |date=2012-03-09 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexism in languages other than English ===
[[Romanic languages]] such as [[French language|French]]&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Sayare, S. (2012) 'Mademoiselle' exits official France. The New York Times. Retrieved 18 April 2015 from http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/23/world/europe/france-drops-mademoiselle-from-official-use.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-12843948 |title=Mexico advises workers on sexist language - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be seen as reinforcing sexism, in that the masculine form is the default form. The word 'mademoiselle', meaning [[miss]] was declared banished from French administrative forms in 2012 by Prime Minister [[François Fillon]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Current pressure calls for the use of the masculine plural pronoun as the default in a mixed-sex group to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=40545648|title=Attacking a Legacy of Sexist Grammar in the French Class: A Modest Beginning|first=Culley Jane|last=Carson|date=1 January 1993|publisher=|journal=Feminist Teacher|volume=7|issue=2|pages=34–36|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As to Spanish, Mexico's Ministry of the Interior published a guide on how to reduce the use of sexist language.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

[[German language|German]] speakers have also raised questions about how sexism intersects with grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nandi |first=Jacinta |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate-uk/2011/03/05/grappling-with-language-sexism/ |title=Grappling with language sexism |publisher=Blogs.reuters.com |date=2011-03-05 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German language is heavily inflected for gender, number, and case; nearly all nouns denoting the occupations or statuses of human beings are gender-differentiated. For more gender-neutral constructions, gerund nouns are sometimes used instead, as this completely eliminates the grammatical gender distinction in the plural, and significantly reduces it in the singular. For example, instead of ''die Studenten'' ("the men students") or ''die Studentinnen'' ("the women students"), one writes ''die Studierende'' ("the [people who are] studying").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bildung/gleichberechtigung-im-studium-studenten-aeh-aeh-studierende-1.2355340|title=Gleichberechtigung im Studium: Studenten, äh, Studierende|first=Johann|last=Osel|publisher=|via=Sueddeutsche.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this approach introduces an element of ambiguity, because gerund nouns more precisely denote one currently engaged in the activity, rather than one who routinely engages in it as their primary occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Osel, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], some writers have pointed to sexism inherent in the structure of written characters. For example, the character for man is linked to those for positive qualities like courage and effect while the character for wife is composed of a female part and a broom, considered of low worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4316075|title=Sexism in the Chinese Language|first=Dali|last=Tan|date=1 January 1990|publisher=|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=2|issue=4|pages=635–639|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender-specific pejorative terms ===
Gender-specific pejorative terms intimidate or harm another person because of their gender. Sexism can be expressed in language with negative gender-oriented implications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anti-bullyingalliance.org.uk/pdf/SST%20Quick%20Guide.pdf |accessdate=June 16, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Disdain|condescension]]. For example, one may refer to a female as a "girl" rather than a "woman" or a male as a "boy" rather than a man, implying that they are subordinate or not fully mature. Other examples include obscene language. &lt;!-- Do not list swear words here. --&gt;Some words are offensive to transgender people, including "tranny", "she-male", or "he-she". Intentional [[Transphobia#Misgendering and exclusion|misgendering]] (assigning the wrong gender to someone) and the pronoun "it" are also considered pejorative.&lt;ref name="Mills College Report on Inclusion of Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming Students Best Practices, Assessment and Recommendations"&gt;Mills College Transgender Best Practices Taskforce &amp; Gender Identity and Expression Sub-Committee of the Diversity and Social Justice Committee.

Occupational sexism refers to [[discriminatory]] practices, statements or actions, based on a person's [[sex]], occurring in the workplace. One form of occupational sexism is [[wage discrimination]]. In 2008, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) found that while female employment rates have expanded and gender employment and wage gaps have narrowed nearly everywhere, on average women still have 20% less chance to have a job and are paid 17% less than men.&lt;ref name="oecd1"/&gt; The report stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;[In] many countries, labour market [[discrimination]]—i.e. the unequal treatment of equally productive individuals only because they belong to a specific group—is still a crucial factor inflating disparities in employment and the quality of job opportunities [...] Evidence presented in this edition of the ''Employment Outlook'' suggests that about 8 percent of the variation in gender employment gaps and 30 percent of the variation in gender wage gaps across OECD countries can be explained by discriminatory practices in the labour market.&lt;ref name="oecd1"&gt;[[OECD]].

It also found that despite the fact that almost all OECD countries, including the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts About Compensation Discrimination|author=The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/fs-epa.html|accessdate=2008-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; have established anti-discrimination laws, these laws are difficult to enforce.&lt;ref name="oecd1"/&gt;

One 2014 study by Wendy M. Williams and Stephen J. Ceci found that female applicants are preferred 2:1 over identically qualified male applicants in academic hiring. However, its results have been met with skepticism from other researchers, since it contradicts most other studies on the issues.{{citation needed|reason=what source(s) say it contradicts MOST other studies?|date=May 2016}} Joan C. Williams, a distinguished professor at the University of California's Hastings College of Law, raised issues with its methodology, pointing out that the fictional female candidates it used were unusually well-qualified. Studies using more moderately-qualified graduate students have found that male students are much more likely to be hired, offered better salaries, and offered mentorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360.abstract|title=National hiring experiments reveal 2:1 faculty preference for women on STEM tenure track|author=Wendy M.

In Europe, studies based on field experiments in the labour market, provide evidence for no severe levels of discrimination based on female gender. However, unequal treatment is still measured in particular situations, for instance when candidates apply for positions at a higher functional level in Belgium,&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Baert, S., De Pauw, A.-S., Deschacht, N.

=== Wage gap ===
{{Main article|Gender pay gap}}
[[File:EU 27 Gender Pay Gap 2014.png|thumb|upright=1.35|alt=Bar graph showing the gender pay gap in European countries|Gender pay gap in average gross hourly earnings according to [[Eurostat]] 2014.&lt;ref name="EC stats" /&gt;]]
Studies have concluded that on average women earn lower wages than men worldwide. Some people argue that this is the result of widespread gender discrimination in the workplace. Others argue that the wage gap is a result of different choices by men and women, such as women placing more value than men on having children, and men being more likely than women to choose careers in high paying fields such as business, engineering and technology.

[[Eurostat]] found a persistent, average gender pay gap of 27.5% in the 27 [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="EC stats"&gt;[[European Commission]]. [http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/gender-pay-gap/situation-europe/index_en.htm ''The situation in the EU''.] Retrieved on August 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the OECD found that female full-time employees earned 27% less than their male counterparts in OECD countries in 2009.&lt;ref name="oecd1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oecd2"/&gt;

In the United States, the female-to-male earnings ratio was 0.77 in 2009; female full-time, year-round (FTYR) workers earned 77% as much as male FTYR workers. Women's earnings relative to men's fell from 1960 to 1980 (56.7–54.2%), rose rapidly from 1980 to 1990 (54.2–67.6%), leveled off from 1990 to 2000 (67.6–71.2%) and rose from 2000 to 2009 (71.2–77.0%).&lt;ref name="census 2009"&gt;U.S. Census Bureau.

[http://www.iwpr.org/publications/pubs/the-gender-wage-gap-2009 ''The Gender Wage Gap: 2009''.] Retrieved March 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; When the first [[Equal Pay Act of 1963|Equal Pay Act]] was passed in 1963, female full-time workers earned 48.9% as much as male full-time workers.&lt;ref name="census 2009"/&gt;

Research conducted in the Czech and Slovak Republics shows that, even after the governments passed anti-discrimination legislation, two thirds of the gender gap in wages remained unexplained and segregation continued to "represent a major source of the gap".&lt;ref&gt;Štěpán Jurajda (2005): Gender Segregation and Wage Gap: An East-West Comparison.

The gender gap can also vary across-occupation and within occupation. In Taiwan, for example, studies show how the bulk of gender wage discrepancies occur within-occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph E. Zveglich, Jr. and Yana van der Meulen Rodgers (2004): Occupational Segregation and the Gender Wage Gap in a Dynamic East Asian Economy. Southern Economic Journal, Vol. 70, No. 4 (Apr., 2004), pp. 850-875 Published by: Southern Economic Association.&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, research shows that the gender wage gap is distributed unevenly across income levels, and that it mainly occurs at the lower end of income distribution.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Christopher J. Gerry, Byung-Yeon Kim and Carmen A. Li (2004): The Gender Wage Gap and Wage Arrears in Russia: Evidence from the RLMS. Journal of Population Economics, Vol. 17, No. 2 (Jun., 2004), pp. 267-288 Published by: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; The research also found that "wage arrears and payment in-kind attenuated wage discrimination, particularly amongst the lowest paid workers, suggesting that Russian enterprise managers assigned lowest importance to equity considerations when allocating these forms of payment".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The gender pay gap has been attributed to differences in personal and workplace characteristics between men and women (such as education, hours worked and occupation), innate behavioral and biological differences between men and women and discrimination in the labor market (such as gender stereotypes and customer and employer bias). Women currently take significantly more time off to raise children than men.&lt;ref&gt;The Open University: Learning Space.[http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ECON303-8.2.1.pdf "Economics Explains Discrimination in the Labour Market."] Accessed June 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In certain countries such as South Korea, it has also been a long-established practice to lay-off female employees upon marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Gyeongjoon Yoo (2003): Women in the Workplace: Gender and Wage Differentials.

First chapter online: http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7575.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies generally find that a portion of the gender pay gap remains unexplained after accounting for factors assumed to influence earnings; the unexplained portion of the wage gap is attributed to gender discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee]].

Estimates of the discriminatory component of the gender pay gap vary. The OECD estimated that approximately 30% of the gender pay gap across OECD countries is due to discrimination.&lt;ref name="oecd1"/&gt; Australian research shows that discrimination accounts for approximately 60% of the wage differential between men and women.&lt;ref name="natsem"&gt;National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling.

Wage discrimination is theorized as contradicting the economic concept of [[supply and demand]], which states that if a good or service (in this case, labor) is in demand and has value it will find its price in the market. If a worker offered equal value for less pay, supply and demand would indicate a greater demand for lower-paid workers. If a business hired lower-wage workers for the same work, it would lower its costs and enjoy a [[competitive advantage]]. According to supply and demand, if women offered equal value demand (and wages) should rise since they offer a better price (lower wages) for their service than men do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swifteconomics.com/2009/09/21/lies-damned-lies-and-statistics-the-wage-gap/ |title=Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics: The Wage Gap |publisher=Swift Economics |date=September 21, 2009 |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== {{anchor|Proposed Explanations}} Possible causes for wage discrimination ====
According to Denise Venable at the [[National Center for Policy Analysis]], the "wage gap" in the United States is not the result of discrimination but of differences in lifestyle choices. Venable's report found that women are less likely than men to sacrifice personal happiness for increases in income or to choose full-time work. She found that among American adults working between one and thirty-five hours a week and part-time workers who have never been married, women earn more than men. Venable also found that among people aged 27 to 33 who have never had a child, women's earnings approach 89% of men's and "women who hold positions and have skills and experience similar to those of men face wage disparities of less than 10 percent, and many are within a couple of points".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba392 |title=The Wage Gap Myth |publisher=NCPA |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venable concluded that women and men with equal skills and opportunities in the same positions face little or no wage discrimination: "Claims of unequal pay almost always involve comparing apples and oranges".

There is considerable agreement that gender wage discrimination exists, however, when it comes to estimating its magnitude, significant discrepancies are visible. A meta-regression analysis concludes that "the estimated gender gap has been steadily declining" and that the wage rate calculation is proven to be crucial in estimating the wage gap.&lt;ref&gt;T.D.Stanley and Stephen B. Jarrell: Gender Wage Discrimination Bias? A Meta-Regression Analysis. The Journal of Human Resources, Vol XXXIII,4. P. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis further notes that excluding experience and failing to correct for selection bias from analysis might also lead to incorrect conclusions.

=== Glass ceiling effect ===
{{Main article|Glass ceiling}}
"The popular notion of glass ceiling effects implies that gender (or other) disadvantages are stronger at the top of the hierarchy than at lower levels and that these disadvantages become worse later in a person's career."&lt;ref&gt;David A. Cotter, Joan M. Hermsen, Seth Ovadia and Reeve Vanneman (2001): The Glass Ceiling Effect" ''Social Forces'', Vol. 80, No. 2 (Dec., 2001), pp. 655-681 Published by: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, women account for 52% of the overall labor force, but only make up 3% of corporate CEOs and top executives.&lt;ref name="David A 2011"&gt;David A. Matsa and Amalia R. Miller (2011): Chipping away at the Glass Ceiling: Gender Spillovers in Corporate Leadership. American Economic Review: Papers and Proceedings 2011, 101:3, 635–639.&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers see the root cause of this situation in the tacit discrimination based on gender, conducted by current top executives and corporate directors (primarily male), as well as "the historic absence of women in top positions", which "may lead to hysteresis, preventing women from accessing powerful, male-dominated professional networks, or same-sex mentors".&lt;ref name="David A 2011" /&gt; The glass ceiling effect is noted as being especially persistent for women of color (according to a report, "women of colour perceive a 'concrete ceiling' and not simply a glass ceiling").&lt;ref name="David A 2011" /&gt;

In the economics profession, it has been observed that women are more inclined than men to dedicate their time to teaching and service. Since continuous research work is crucial for promotion, "the cumulative effect of small, contemporaneous differences in research orientation could generate the observed significant gender difference in promotion".&lt;ref&gt;John M. McDowell, Larry D. Singell, Jr., and James P. Ziliak (1999): Cracks in the Glass Ceiling: Gender and Promotion in the Economics Profession. The American Economic Review, Vol. 89, No. 2, Papers and Proceedings of the One Hundred Eleventh Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association (May 1999), pp. 392-396 Published by: American Economic Association.&lt;/ref&gt; In the high-tech industry, research shows that, regardless of the intra-firm changes, "extra-organizational pressures will likely contribute to continued gender stratification as firms upgrade, leading to the potential masculinization of skilled high-tech work".&lt;ref&gt;Steven C. McKay (2006): Hard Drives and Glass Ceilings: Gender Stratification in High-Tech Production. Gender and Society, Vol. 20, No. 2, Apr 2006, pp 207 – 235. Published by Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] asserts that "progress in bringing women into leadership and decision making positions around the world remains far too slow".&lt;ref name="UN-IWD2006"&gt;{{cite web|title=Women still struggle to break through glass ceiling in government, business, academia|publisher=United Nations|date=2006-03-08|url=http://www.un.org/events/women/iwd/2006/PressReleaseIWD8March.pdf|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Potential remedies ====
Research by David Matsa and Amalia Miller suggests that a possible remedy to the glass ceiling could be increasing the number of women on corporate boards, which could subsequently lead to increases in the number of women working in top management positions.&lt;ref name="David A 2011"/&gt; The same research suggests that this could also result in a "feedback cycle in which the presence of more female managers increases the qualified pool of potential female board members (for the companies they manage, as well as other companies), leading to greater female board membership and then further increases in female executives".&lt;ref name="UN-IWD2006" /&gt;

=== Weight based sexism ===
A 2009 study found that being overweight harms women's career advancement, but presents no barrier for men. [[Overweight]] women were significantly underrepresented among company bosses, making up between 5% and 22% of female CEOs. However, the proportion of overweight male CEOs was between 45% and 61%, over-representing overweight men. On the other hand, approximately 5% of CEOs were obese among both genders. The author of the study stated that the results suggest that "the '[[glass ceiling]] effect' on women's advancement may reflect not only general negative stereotypes about the competencies of women, but also weight bias that results in the application of stricter appearance standards to women." &lt;ref&gt;Roehling, Patricia V., Mark V.

In August 1995, Kimberly Nixon filed a complaint with the [[British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal]] against Vancouver Rape Relief &amp; Women's Shelter. Nixon, a [[trans woman]], had been interested in volunteering as a counselor with the shelter. When the shelter learned that she was [[transsexual]], they told Nixon that she would not be allowed to volunteer with the organization. Nixon argued that this constituted illegal [[discrimination]] under Section 41 of the [[British Columbia Human Rights Code]]. Vancouver Rape Relief countered that individuals are shaped by the [[socialization]] and experiences of their formative years, and that Nixon had been socialized as a male growing up, and that, therefore, Nixon would not be able to provide sufficiently effective counseling to the female born women that the shelter served.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thetyee.ca/News/2007/02/03/Nixon/|title=Transsexual Loses Fight with Women's Shelter {{!}} The Tyee|last=Rupp|first=Shannon|date=2007-02-03|website=The Tyee|language=English|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to objectification theory, objectification can have important repercussions on women, particularly young women, as it can negatively impact their psychological health and lead to the development of mental disorders, such as [[Major depressive disorder|unipolar depression]], [[sexual dysfunction]], and [[eating disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="FredricksonRoberts1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fredrickson|first1=Barbara L.|last2=Roberts|first2=Tomi-Ann|title=OBJECTIFICATION THEORY.|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume=21|issue=2|year=1997|pages=173–206|issn=0361-6843|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00108.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In advertising ===
While advertising used to portray women in obviously stereotypical roles (e.g., as a housewife), women in modern advertisements are no longer solely confined to the home. However, advertising today nonetheless still stereotypes women, albeit in more subtle ways, including by sexually objectifying them.&lt;ref name="Lindner2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lindner|first1=Katharina|title=Images of women in general interest and fashion magazine advertisements from 1955 to 2002 | journal= [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume= 51 | issue= 7/8 | date= October 2004 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | pages= 409–421 |doi= 10.1023/B:SERS.0000049230.86869.4d | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:SERS.0000049230.86869.4d | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Attenborough | first = Frederick | author-link = Frederick T.

=== Pornography ===
{{See also|Feminist views on pornography}}
Anti-pornography feminist [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argues that [[pornography]] contributes to sexism by objectifying women and portraying them in submissive roles.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, Catharine (1987). ''Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; MacKinnon, along with Andrea Dworkin, argues that pornography reduces women to mere tools, and is a form of sex discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Papadaki|first=Evangelia|title=Feminist Perspectives on Objectification|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/feminism-objectification/|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two scholars highlight the link between objectification and pornography by stating:

"We define pornography as the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures and words that also includes (i) women are presented dehumanized as sexual objects, things, or commodities; or (ii) women are presented as sexual objects who enjoy humiliation or pain; or (iii) women are presented as sexual objects experiencing sexual pleasure in rape, incest or other sexual assault; or (iv) women are presented as sexual objects tied up, cut up or mutilated or bruised or physically hurt; or (v) women are presented in postures or positions of sexual submission, servility, or display; or (vi) women's body parts—including but not limited to vaginas, breasts, or buttocks—are exhibited such that women are reduced to those parts; or (vii) women are presented being penetrated by objects or animals; or (viii) women are presented in scenarios of degradation, humiliation, injury, torture, shown as filthy or inferior, bleeding, bruised, or hurt in a context that makes these conditions sexual."&lt;ref name="DworkinMacKinnon1988"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrea Dworkin|author2=Catharine A.

[[Robin Morgan]] and Catharine MacKinnon suggest that certain types of pornography also contribute to [[violence against women]] by eroticizing scenes in which women are dominated, coerced, humiliated or [[sexually assault]]ed.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Robin. (1974). "Theory and Practice: Pornography and Rape". In: ''Going Too Far: The Personal Chronicle of a Feminist''. (1977). Random House. 333 p. ISBN 0-394-48227-1.

Some people opposed to pornography, including MacKinnon, charge that the production of pornography entails physical, psychological, and economic [[coercion]] of the women who perform and model in it.&lt;ref name="stanford-shrage"&gt;Shrage, Laurie.

MacKinnon writes:
{{quote|Pornography affects people's belief in rape myths. So for example if a woman says "I didn't consent" and people have been viewing pornography, they believe rape myths and believe the woman did consent no matter what she said. That when she said no, she meant yes. When she said she didn't want to, that meant more beer. When she said she would prefer to go home, that means she's a lesbian who needs to be given a good corrective experience. Pornography promotes these rape myths and desensitizes people to violence against women so that you need more violence to become sexually aroused if you're a pornography consumer. This is very well documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/apr/12/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Stuart | last=Jeffries | title=Stuart Jeffries talks to leading feminist Catharine MacKinnon | date=April 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Defenders of pornography and anti-censorship activists (including [[sex-positive feminists]]) argue that pornography does not seriously impact a mentally healthy individual, since the viewer can distinguish between fantasy and reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael |last=Bader |url=http://www.alternet.org/story/104863/the_great_porn_misunderstanding%3A_pornography_is_mostly_about_fantasy,_not_reality |title=The Great Porn Misunderstanding: Pornography Is Mostly About Fantasy, Not Reality |publisher=Alternet |date=October 27, 2008 |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They contend that both sexes are objectified in pornography (particularly [[Sadomasochism|sadistic or masochistic]] pornography, in which men are objectified and sexually used by women).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seejane.org/downloads/Hatton_Trautner_Sexuality_and_Culture.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123115712/http://www.seejane.org/downloads/Hatton_Trautner_Sexuality_and_Culture.pdf |date=January 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prostitution ===
[[Prostitution]] is the business or practice of engaging in [[human sexual activity|sexual relations]] in exchange for [[payment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prostitution – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prostitution|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prostitution Law &amp; Legal Definition|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/prostitution|publisher=US Legal|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex workers are often objectified and are seen as existing only to serve clients, thus calling their sense of agency into question. There is a prevailing notion that because they sell sex professionally, prostitutes automatically consent to all sexual contact.&lt;ref name="sullivan"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://anj.sagepub.com/content/40/2/127.abstract | title=Rape, Prostitution and Consent | author=Sullivan, Barbara | journal=The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology | year=2007 | volume=40 | issue=2 | pages=127–142 | quote=In common law jurisdictions like the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, some of the evidentiary jurisprudence clearly linked chastity with veracity. So women who were or had been sex workers, those who were ‘rumoured’ to be prostitutes or who were simply promiscuous and behaving ‘like a prostitute’ lacked credibility as complainants, which made it difficult for the prosecution to prove the sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt. Women in any of these categories were seen at law as ‘commonly available’ to men, as always consenting to sexual activity and thus, as  not able to be raped. Men accused of sexual assault were therefore able to use evidence of prostitution to defend themselves, to undermine the credibility of rape complainants and to successfully avoid conviction. | doi=10.1375/acri.40.2.127}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, sex workers face higher [[violence against prostitutes|rates of violence]] and sexual assault. This is often dismissed, ignored and not taken seriously by authorities.&lt;ref name="sullivan" /&gt;

In many countries, prostitution is dominated by brothels or pimps, who often claim ownership over sex workers. This sense of ownership furthers the concept that sex workers are void of agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:icYI4UCtGeMJ:www.walnet.org/csis/papers/redefining.html%20&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us|title=Redefining Prostitution as Sex Work on the International Agenda|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is literally the case in instances of [[sexual slavery]].

Various authors have argued that female prostitution is based on male sexism that condones the idea that unwanted sex with a woman is acceptable, that men's desires must be satisfied, and that women are coerced into and exist to serve men sexually.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soc.iastate.edu/sapp/Prostitution.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jan/18/ukcrime.prisonsandprobation|title=Julie Bindel: Eradicate the oldest oppression - UK news - The Guardian|author=Julie Bindel|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/10/endingatradeinmisery|title=Ending a trade in misery|author=Julie Bindel|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mlFgjEBYWYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+industrial+vagina&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BVQ7UqTUN-Tl4gTIoYGADg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20industrial%20vagina&amp;f=false|title=The Industrial Vagina|work=Google.ro|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Women's Lobby]] condemned prostitution as "an intolerable form of male violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenslobby.eu/spip.php?article472|title=European Women's Lobby  :  Prostitution in Europe : 60 Years of Reluctance|work=womenslobby.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carole Pateman]] writes that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jH2KPvZF1L0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ro&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Sexual Contract|work=Google.ro|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Prostitution is the use of a woman's body by a man for his own satisfaction. There is no desire or satisfaction on the part of the prostitute. Prostitution is not mutual, pleasurable exchange of the use of bodies, but the unilateral use of a woman's body by a man in exchange for money."

=== Media portrayals ===
Some scholars believe that media portrayals of demographic groups can both maintain and disrupt attitudes and behaviors toward those groups.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, E., &amp; Henderson Daniel, J. (Eds.). (2005). ''Featuring females: Feminist analyses of media.'' Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. {{DOI|10.1037/11213-000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Halliwell | first1 = E. | last2 = Malson | first2 = H. | last3 = Tischner | first3 = I. | year = 2011 | title = Are contemporary media images which seem to display women as sexually empowering actually harmful to women? | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 34–45 | doi = 10.1177/0361684310385217 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Entman, R., &amp; Rojecki, A. (2000). ''The Black image in the White mind: Media and race in America.'' Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2013}} According to Susan Douglas: "Since the early 1990s, much of the media have come to overrepresent women as having made it-completely-in the professions, as having gained sexual equality with men, and having achieved a level of financial success and comfort enjoyed primarily by Tiffany's-encrusted doyennes of Laguna Beach."&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, J., Susan (2010). ''The Rise of Enlightened Sexism'' New York, NY: St. Martins Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These images may be harmful, particularly to women and racial and ethnic minority groups. For example, a study of African American women found they feel that media portrayals of African American women often reinforce stereotypes of this group as overly sexual and idealize images of lighter-skinned, thinner African American women (images African American women describe as objectifying).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = L.

In an attempt to study the effect of media consumption on males, Samantha and Bridges found an effect on body shame, though not through self-objectification as it was found in comparable studies of women. The authors conclude that the current measures of objectification were designed for women and do not measure men accurately.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, Samantha, and Sara K. Bridges. "The drive for muscularity in men: Media influences and objectification theory." Body Image 7.1 (2010): 32-38.&lt;/ref&gt; Another study also found a negative effect on eating attitudes and body satisfaction of consumption of beauty and fitness magazines for women and men respectively, but again with different mechanisms, namely self-objectification for women and internalization for men.&lt;ref&gt;Magazine exposure: Internalization, self-objectification, eating attitudes, and body satisfaction in male and female university students.

=== Sexist jokes ===
[[Frederick T. Attenborough|Frederick Attenborough]] argues that sexist jokes can be a form of sexual objectification, which reduce the butt of the joke to an object. They not only objectify women, but can also condone violence or prejudice against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Attenborough | first1 = Frederick T. | author-link1 = Frederick T.

== Gender discrimination ==
Gender discrimination is discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived [[gender identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Uu_J5g37DMMJ:https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40934.pdf%20&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us|title=Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Discrimination in Employment: A Legal Analysis of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (|first=|last=R40934|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender identity is "the gender-related identity, appearance, or mannerisms or other gender-related characteristics of an individual, with or without regard to the individual's designated sex at birth".&lt;ref name="fas.org"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Feder, Jody  |author2=Cynthia Brougher |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Discrimination in Employment: A Legal Analysis of the Employment Non_Discrimination Act (ENDA)|date=July 15, 2013|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40934.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Fas.org|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender discrimination is theoretically different from sexism.&lt;ref&gt;5. Kimmel, Michael S. 2004. The Gendered Society. 2d ed. New York: Oxford Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas sexism is prejudice based on biological sex, gender discrimination specifically addresses discrimination towards identity based orientations, including [[third gender]], [[genderqueer]], and other non-binary identified people.&lt;ref&gt;6. Macklem, Tony. 2004. Beyond Comparison: Sex and Discrimination. New York: Cambridge Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Banning discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression has emerged as a subject of contention in the American legal system.&lt;ref name="hrc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/laws-and-legislation/federal-legislation/employment-non-discrimination-act |title=Employment Non-Discrimination Act &amp;#124; Resources &amp;#124; Human Rights Campaign |publisher=Hrc.org |date=2015-03-09 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a recent report by the Congressional Research Service, "although the majority of federal courts to consider the issue have concluded that discrimination on the basis of gender identity is not sex discrimination, there have been several courts that have reached the opposite conclusion".&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt; Hurst states that "[c]ourts often confuse sex, gender and sexual orientation, and confuse them in a way that results in denying the rights not only of gays and lesbians, but also of those who do not present themselves or act in a manner traditionally expected of their sex".&lt;ref&gt;1. Hurst, C. Social Inequality: Forms, Causes, and Consequences. Sixth Edition. 2007. 131, 139–142&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oppositional sexism===
Oppositional sexism is a term coined by [[Transfeminism|transfeminist]] author [[Julia Serano]], who defined oppositional sexism as "the belief that male and female are rigid, mutually exclusive categories."&lt;ref name=":439"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity|last = Serano|first = Julia|publisher = Seal Press|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-786-74791-7|location = Emeryville, CA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oppositional sexism plays a vital role in a number of [[Norm (social)|social norms]] Viz. [[cissexism]], [[heteronormativity]], and traditional sexism.

Oppositional sexism normalizes masculine expression in males and feminine expression in females while simultaneously demonizing femininity in males and masculinity in females. This concept plays a crucial role in supporting cissexism, the social norm that views cisgender people as both natural and privileged as opposed to transgender people.&lt;ref name=":889"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Counseling Across Cultures|publisher = SAGE Publications|year = 2015|isbn = 9781452217529|location = United States of America|pages = |edition = 7th|editor-first2 = Walter|editor-last = Pedersen|editor-first = Paul|editor-last2 = Lonner|editor-last3 = Draguns|editor-first3 = Juris|editor-last4 = Trimble|editor-first4 = Joseph|editor-last5 = Scharrón-del Río|editor-first5 = María}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of having two, totally opposite genders is tied to sexuality through what [[Gender studies|gender theorist]] [[Judith Butler]] calls a "compulsory practice of heterosexuality."&lt;ref name=":889" /&gt; Because oppositional sexism is tied to heteronormativity in this way, non-heterosexuals are seen as breaking gender norms.&lt;ref name=":889" /&gt;

The concept of opposite genders sets a "dangerous precedent", according to Serano, where "if men are big then women must be small; and if men are strong then women must be weak."&lt;ref name=":439" /&gt; The [[gender binary]] and oppositional norms work together to support "traditional sexism," the belief that femininity is inferior to and serves masculinity.&lt;ref name=":889" /&gt;

Serano states that oppositional sexism works in tandem with "traditional sexism." This ensures that "those who are masculine have power over those who are feminine, and that only those that are born male will be seen as authentically masculine."&lt;ref name=":439" /&gt;

The National Transgender Discrimination Survey, the most extensive survey of transgender discrimination, in collaboration with the National Black Justice Coalition recently showed that Black [[transgender people in the United States]] suffer "the combination of anti-transgender bias and persistent, structural and individual racism" and that "black transgender people live in extreme poverty that is more than twice the rate for transgender people of all races (15%), four times the general Black population rate 9% and over eight times the general US population rate (4%)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://endtransdiscrimination.org/report.html |title=the Survey |publisher=Endtransdiscrimination.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study conducted in collaboration with the League of United Latin American Citizens, Latino/a transgender people who were non-citizens were most vulnerable to harassment, abuse and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://endtransdiscrimination.org/report.html |title=the Survey |publisher=End Trans Discrimination |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further discrimination is faced by gender nonconforming individuals, whether transitioning or not, due to displacement from societally acceptable gender binaries and visible stigmatization. According to the NTDS, transgender gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals face between 8% and 15% high rates of self and social discrimination and violence than binary transgender individuals. Lisa R. Miller and Eric Anthony Grollman found in their 2015 study that "gender nonconformity may heighten trans people's exposure to discrimination and health-harming behaviors. Gender nonconforming trans adults reported more events of major and everyday transphobic discrimination than their gender conforming counterparts."&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Lisa R., and Eric Anthony Grollman. “[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/socf.12193/full The Social Costs of Gender Nonconformity for Transgender Adults: Implications for Discrimination and Health].” Sociological Forum 30.3 (2015): 809–831.

Domestic violence is tolerated and even legally accepted in many parts of the world. For instance, in 2010, the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE)'s Supreme Court ruled that a man has the right to physically discipline his wife and children if he does not leave visible marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-10-19/world/uae.court.ruling_1_islamic-law-sharia-law-ruling?_s=PM:WORLD |title=Court in UAE says beating wife, child OK if no marks are left |publisher=CNN |accessdate=July 20, 2013 |date=October 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[Equality Now]] drew attention a section of the Penal Code of Northern Nigeria, titled ''Correction of Child, Pupil, Servant or Wife'' which reads: "(1) Nothing is an offence which does not amount to the infliction of grievous hurt upon any persons which is done: (...)

According to a report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the 58th session of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] concerning cultural practices in the family that reflect violence against women:

{{quote|The Special Rapporteur indicated that there had been contradictory decisions with regard to the honour defense in [[Brazil]], and that legislative provisions allowing for partial or complete defense in that context could be found in the penal codes of Argentina, Ecuador, Egypt, Guatemala, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Peru, Syria, Venezuela, and the [[Palestinian National Authority]].&lt;ref name="unhchr"&gt;''Working towards the elimination of crimes against women committed in the name of honour: Report of the Secretary-General''. 2 July 2002.

Practices such as honor killings and stoning continue to be supported by mainstream politicians and other officials in some countries. In Pakistan, after the 2008 [[Balochistan honour killings]] in which five women were killed by tribesmen of the [[Umrani|Umrani Tribe]] of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], Pakistani Federal Minister for Postal Services [[Israr Ullah Zehri]] defended the practice:&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4678530.ece |title=Three teenagers buried alive in 'honour killings' |accessdate=2008-09-05 |work=Times Online | location=London | first=Zahid | last=Hussain | date=2008-09-05}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; "These are centuries-old traditions, and I will continue to defend them.

[[Dowry deaths]] are the result of the killing women who are unable to pay the high [[dowry]] price for their marriage. According to Amnesty International, "the ongoing reality of dowry-related violence is an example of what can happen when women are treated as property".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/women-s-rights/violence-against-women/violence-against-women-information|title=Violence Against Women Information|work=Amnesty International USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Female infanticide]] is the killing of newborn female children or the termination of a female fetus through [[Sex-selective abortion|selective abortion]].

[[Sex-selective abortion]] involves terminating a pregnancy based upon the predicted sex of the baby.

[[File:Campaign road sign against female genital mutilation (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|Campaign against [[female genital mutilation]] in [[Uganda]].]]

Female genital mutilation is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as "all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons". WHO further state that, "the procedure has no health benefits for girls and women" and "[p]rocedures can cause severe bleeding and problems urinating, and later cysts, infections, infertility as well as complications in childbirth increased risk of newborn death,"&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/|title=WHO - Female genital mutilation|work=Who.int|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women" and "constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women".&lt;ref name="WHO" /&gt; The [[European Parliament]] stated in a resolution that the practice "clearly goes against the European founding value of equality between women and men and maintains traditional values according to which women are seen as the objects and properties of men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;language=EN&amp;reference=P7-TA-2014-0105 |title=Texts adopted - Thursday, 6 February 2014 - Elimination of female genital mutilation - P7_TA(2014)0105 |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminalization of [[marital rape]] is very recent, having occurred during the past few decades; and in many countries it is still legal. Several countries in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia made spousal rape illegal before 1970; other European countries and some of the English-speaking countries outside Europe outlawed it later, mostly in the 1980s and 1990s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWttAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR1&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;dq=The+Routledge+Handbook+of+European+Criminology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=W397XfxDSQ&amp;sig=KC-3iBJ6HPkmE5WUZP9vldrwQFA&amp;hl=ro&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WhTUUsLiM8GTywONt4CYCw&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Routledge%20Handbook%20of%20European%20Criminology&amp;f=false|title=The Routledge Handbook of European Criminology|work=Google.ro|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; some countries outlawed it in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6225872.stm|title=Thailand passes marital rape bill|date=21 June 2007|publisher=|via=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO wrote that: "Marriage is often used to legitimize a range of forms of sexual violence against women. The custom of marrying off young children, particularly girls, is found in many parts of the world. This practice—legal in many countries—is a form of sexual violence, since the children involved are unable to give or withhold their consent".&lt;ref name="whqlibdoc.who.int"/&gt;

In countries where [[fornication]] or [[adultery]] are illegal, victims of rape can be charged criminally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-21595814|title=BBC News - Maldives girl to get 100 lashes for pre-marital sex|work=BBC News|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== War rape ====
{{Main article|War rape}}
[[File:DRC raped women.jpg|thumb|Meeting of victims of [[sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]].]]
Sexism is manifested by the crime of rape targeting women civilians and soldiers, committed by soldiers, combatants or civilians during armed conflict, war or military occupation. This arises from the long tradition of women being seen as sexual booty and from the misogynistic culture of military training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103844570|title=The Nation: The Plight of Women Soldiers|date=6 May 2009|work=NPR.org|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3848/|title=Why Soldiers Rape|work=Inthesetimes.com|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual violence and rape are also committed against men during war and are often under-reported. Sexism plays a significant part in the difficulty that the survivors face coping with their victimization, especially in patriarchal cultures, and in the lack of support provided to men who have been raped.&lt;ref name=MaleRapeWar&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/jul/17/the-rape-of-men|title=The rape of men|last1=Storr|first1=Will|date=16 July 2011|work=The Observer|accessdate=8 March 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A child marriage is a marriage where one or both spouses are under 18, a practice that disproportionately affects women.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/protection/57929_58008.html|title=Child marriage|date=22 October 2014|work=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/06/14/q-child-marriage-and-violations-girls-rights|title=Q &amp; A: Child Marriage and Violations of Girls' Rights - Human Rights Watch|work=Hrw.org|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Child marriages are most common in [[South Asia]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], but occur in other parts of the world, too. The practice of marrying young girls is rooted in patriarchal ideologies of control of female behavior, and is also sustained by traditional practices such as [[dowry]] and [[bride price]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.port.ac.uk/uopnews/2013/11/19/dowry-and-abuse-still-a-problem-in-india/|title=Dowry and abuse still a problem in India|publisher=|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Child marriage is strongly connected with the protection of female [[virginity]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/people/features/ihavearightto/four_b/casestudy_art16.shtml|title=I have a right to - BBC World Service|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNICEF states that:&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;
:"Marrying girls under 18 years old is rooted in [[gender discrimination]], encouraging premature and continuous child bearing and giving preference to boys' education. Child marriage is also a strategy for economic survival as families marry off their daughters at an early age to reduce their economic burden."

Consequences of child marriage include restricted education and employment prospects, increased risk of [[domestic violence]], [[child sexual abuse]], pregnancy and birth complications, and [[social isolation]].&lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; Early and forced marriage are defined as forms of modern-day slavery by the International Labour Organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/02/nigeria-child-brides-religion |title=Nigeria's child brides: 'I thought being in labour would never end' |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=September 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|OIC]] countries the legal testimony of a woman is worth legally half of that of a man (see [[Status of women's testimony in Islam]]). Such countries include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/gender/gender_62215.html |title=from the Middle East and North Africa Region (MENA) &amp;#124; Gender equality |publisher=UNICEF.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/people/features/ihavearightto/four_b/casestudy_art07.shtml |title=I have a right to &amp;#124; BBC World Service |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algeria (in criminal cases), Bahrain (in Sharia courts), Egypt (in family courts), Iran (in most cases), Iraq (in some cases), Jordan (in Sharia courts), Kuwait (in family courts), Libya (in some cases), Morocco (in family cases), Palestine (in cases related to marriage, divorce and child custody), Qatar (in family law matters), Syria (in Sharia courts), United Arab Emirates (in some civil matters), Yemen (not allowed to testify at all in cases of adultery and retribution), and Saudi Arabia. Such laws have been criticized by [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Equality Now]] as being discriminatory towards women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/zh-hans/node/109622/section/11 |title=Codifying Repression &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=2012-05-07 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equalitynow.org/law/the_islamic_penal_code_of_2013_books_i_ii_and_v |title=The Islamic Penal Code of 2013, Books I, II and V |publisher=Equalitynow.org |date=2015-02-06 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminal justice system in many [[common law countries]] has also been accused of discriminating against women. [[Provocation (legal)|Provocation]] is, in many common law countries, a partial defense to [[murder]], which converts what would have been murder into [[manslaughter]]. It is meant to be applied when a person kills in the "heat of passion" upon being "provoked" by the behavior of the victim. This defense has been criticized as being gendered, favoring men, due to it being used disproportionately in cases of [[adultery]], and other domestic disputes when women are killed by their partners. As a result of the defense exhibiting a strong gender bias, and being a form of legitimization of male violence against women and minimization of the harm caused by violence against women, it has been abolished or restricted in several jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Prod/parlment/publications.nsf/0/F2BA1BFEED2D87EECA257A4800001BD7/$File/briefing%20paper.provocation%20and%20self-defence.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140623052433/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Prod/parlment/publications.nsf/0/F2BA1BFEED2D87EECA257A4800001BD7/$File/briefing%20paper.provocation%20and%20self-defence.pdf |date=June 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kate Fitz-Gibbon |url=http://anj.sagepub.com/content/45/2/194.abstract |title=Provocation in New South Wales: The need for abolition |publisher=Anj.sagepub.com |date=2012-08-01 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional leniently towards [[crimes of passion]] in [[Latin America]]n countries has been deemed to have its origin in the view that women are property.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling.html|title=Thousands of Women Killed for Family "Honor"|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Widney Brown, advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, stated that, "[S]o-called crimes of passion have a similar dynamic [to honor killings] in that the women are killed by male family members and the crimes are perceived as excusable or understandable." &lt;ref name="nationalgeographic.com"/&gt; The [[OHCHR]] has called for "the elimination of discriminatory provisions in the legislation, including mitigating factors for 'crimes of passion'".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/WRGS/OnePagers/Gender_motivated_killings.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, some studies have shown that for identical crimes, men are given harsher sentences than women. Controlling for arrest offense, criminal history, and other pre-charge variables, sentences are over 60% heavier for men. Women are more likely to avoid charges entirely, and to avoid imprisonment if convicted.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/11/men-women-prison-sentence-length-gender-gap_n_1874742.html |title=Men Sentenced To Longer Prison Terms Than Women For Same Crimes, Study Says |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=July 20, 2013 |first=Simon |last=McCormack |date=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Michigan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umich.edu/newsandinfo/features/Pages/starr_gender_disparities.aspx|title=Study finds large gender disparities in federal criminal cases|publisher=Law.umich.edu|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gender disparity varies according to the nature of the case. For example, the gender gap is less pronounced in fraud cases than in drug trafficking and firearms. This disparity occurs in US federal courts, despite guidelines designed to avoid differential sentencing.&lt;ref name="etd.ohiolink.edu"&gt;[http://etd.ohiolink.edu/view.cgi?acc_num=bgsu1237482038 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630184354/http://etd.ohiolink.edu/view.cgi?acc_num=bgsu1237482038 |date=June 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The death penalty in may also suffer from gender bias. According to Shatz and Shatz, "[t]he present study confirms what earlier studies have shown: that the death penalty is imposed on women relatively infrequently and that it is disproportionately imposed for the killing of women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/studies-gender-bias-death-sentencing|title=STUDIES: Gender Bias in Death Sentencing|work=Deathpenaltyinfo.org|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several reasons postulated for the gender criminal justice disparity in the United States. One of the most common is expectation that women are predominantly care-givers.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Michigan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="etd.ohiolink.edu"/&gt; Other possible reasons include the "girlfriend theory" (whereby women are seen as tools of their boyfriends),&lt;ref name="University of Michigan"/&gt; the theory that female defendants are more likely to cooperate with authorities,&lt;ref name="University of Michigan"/&gt; and that women are often successful at turning their violent crime into victimhood by citing defenses such as [[postpartum depression]] or [[battered wife syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearson|first=Patricia|title=When She Was Bad: How and Why Women Get Away With Murder|year=1998|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=0140243887|pages=236–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, none of these theories account for the total disparity,&lt;ref name="University of Michigan"/&gt; and sexism has also been suggested as an underlying cause.&lt;ref&gt;"Unlike race and ethnic discrimination, however, the evidence is more consistent that part of this gap is due to different treatment of offenders based on their gender."{{cite web|url=http://www.ussc.gov/Research_and_Statistics/Research_Projects/Miscellaneous/15_Year_Study/chap4.pdf|title=Chapter Four: Racial, Ethnic, and Gender Disparities In Federal Sentencing Today|publisher=Ussc.gov|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender discrimination also helps explain the differences between trial outcomes in which some female defendants are sentenced to death and other female defendants are sentenced to lesser punishments. Phillip Barron argues that female defendants are more likely to be sentenced to death for crimes that violate gender norms, such as killing children or killing strangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barron|first1=Phillip|title=Gender Discrimination in the U.S. Death Penalty System|journal=Radical Philosophy Review|date=2000|volume=3|issue=1|pages=89–96|url=https://www.academia.edu/347780/Gender_Discrimination_in_the_U.S._Death_Penalty_System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgender people face widespread discrimination while incarcerated. They are generally housed according to their legal birth sex, rather than their [[gender identity]]. Studies have shown that transgender people are at an increased risk for harassment and sexual assault in this environment. They may also be denied access to medical procedures related to their reassignment.&lt;ref&gt;"Unlike race and ethnic discrimination, however, the evidence is more consistent that part of this gap is due to different treatment of offenders based on their gender."{{cite web|url=http://www.autostraddle.com/real-life-sophia-bursets-transgender-women-face-a-nightmare-in-mens-prisons-186876/|title=Real life Sophia Bursets Transgender Women face a nightmare in Men's Prisons|accessdate=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries use [[stoning]] as a form of capital punishment. According to [[Amnesty International]], the majority of those stoned are women and women are disproportionately affected by stoning because of sexism in the legal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/iran-death-stoning-grotesque-and-unacceptable-penalty-20080115|title=Amnesty International - Iran: Death by stoning, a grotesque and unacceptable penalty|date=15 January 2008|work=amnesty.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020184028/http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/iran-death-stoning-grotesque-and-unacceptable-penalty-20080115|archive-date=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
{{main article|Sex differences in education|Sexism in academia}}
Women have traditionally had limited access to higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Barbara Miller. ''In the Company of Educated Women.''&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, when women were admitted to higher education, they were encouraged to major in less-scientific subjects; the study of [[English literature]] in American and British colleges and universities was instituted as a field considered suitable to women's "lesser intellects".&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, Terry. ''Literary Theory.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational specialties in higher education produce and perpetuate inequality between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nsf.gov/career-life-balance/Gender%20Segregation%20in%20Elite%20Academic%20Science_Sage%20Pub_2012.pdf | title=Gender Segregation in Elite Academic Science | journal=Gender &amp; Society | year=2012 | volume=26 | issue=5 | pages=693–717 | first1=Elaine Howard | last1=Ecklund | first2=Anne E. | last2=Lincoln | first3=Cassandra | last3=Tansey | doi=10.1177/0891243212451904}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disparity persists particularly in computer and [[information science]], where in the US women received only 21% of the undergraduate degrees, and in engineering, where women obtained only 19% of the degrees in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, M. Sonnert G. and Nikiforova, I., 2011, Programs for Undergraduate Women in Science and Engineering: Issues, Problems, and Solutions, Gender and Society, 25 vol., p. 590&lt;/ref&gt; Only one out of five of physics doctorates in the US are awarded to women, and only about half of those women are American.&lt;ref name="physics"&gt;Pollack, E.

World [[literacy#Gender disparities|literacy]] is lower for females than for males. Data from ''[[The World Factbook]]'' shows that 79.7% of women are literate, compared to 88.6% of men (aged 15 and over).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some parts of the world, girls continue to be excluded from proper public or private education. In parts of Afghanistan, girls who go to school face serious violence from some local community members and religious groups.&lt;ref name="edition.cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/02/world/meast/cnnheroes-jan-afghan-school/index.html | work=CNN | title=Acid attacks, poison: What Afghan girls risk by going to school - CNN.com | date=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational opportunities and outcomes for women have greatly improved in the West. Since 1991, the proportion of women enrolled in college in the United States has exceeded the enrollment rate for men, and the gap has widened over time.&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Education Statistics, http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2005/2005028.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2007}}, women made up the majority—54%—of the 10.8&amp;nbsp;million college students enrolled in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prb.org/Articles/2007/CrossoverinFemaleMaleCollegeEnrollmentRates.aspx |title=The Crossover in Female-Male College Enrollment Rates |publisher=Prb.org |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research by Diane Halpern has indicated that boys receive more attention, praise, blame and punishment in the grammar-school classroom,&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, Diane F. ''Sex differences in cognitive abilities.'' Laurence Erlbaum Associates, 2000. ISBN 0-8058-2792-7.

Writer Gerry Garibaldi has argued that the educational system has become "feminized", allowing girls more of a chance at success with a more "girl-friendly" environment in the classroom;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Gerry |last=Garibaldi |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/16_3_schools_boys.html |title=How the Schools Shortchange Boys |publisher=City-journal.org |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is seen to hinder boys by punishing "masculine" behavior and diagnosing boys with [[Emotional and behavioral disorders|behavioral disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Carolyn |last=Abraham |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/time-to-lead/failing-boys/part-3-are-we-medicating-a-disorder-or-treating-boyhood-as-a-disease/article1762859/ |title=Part 3: Are we medicating a disorder or treating boyhood as a disease? |publisher=The Globe and Mail |accessdate=July 20, 2013 |location=Toronto |date=August 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study by the OECD in over 60 countries found that teachers give boys lower grades for the same work.

The assignment of gender specific baby clothes from young ages can be seen as sexist as it can instill in children from young ages a belief in negative gender stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/julie-bindel-boys-arent-born-wanting-to-wear-blue-6293688.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Julie | last=Bindel | title=Julie Bindel: Boys aren't born wanting to wear blue | date=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the assignment in some countries of the color pink to girls and blue to boys. This fashion, however, is a recent one; at the beginning of the 20th century the trend was the opposite: blue for girls and pink for boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/when-did-girls-start-wearing-pink-1370097/ | title=When Did Girls Start Wearing Pink? | publisher=Smithsonian (magazine) | date=7 April 2011 | accessdate=16 March 2015 | author=Maglaty, Jeanne}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1900s, The Women's Journal wrote "[t]hat pink being a more decided and stronger colour, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl." ''DressMaker'' magazine also explained that "[t]he preferred colour to dress young boys in is pink. Blue is reserved for girls as it is considered paler, and the more dainty of the two colours, and pink is thought to be stronger (akin to red)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7817496.stm | work=BBC News | title=Should we not dress girls in pink? | date=January 8, 2009|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, in most countries, it is considered inappropriate for boys to wear dresses and skirts, but this is also a relatively modern worldview. From the mid-16th century&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Scheussler suggests a date of post-1540 for England, France, and the Low Countries; see Scheussler, "'She Hath Over Grown All that She Ever Hath': Children's Clothing in the Lisle Letters, 1533-40", in Netherton, Robin, and Gale R. Owen-Crocker, editors, ''Medieval Clothing and Textiles'', Volume 3, p. 185.  Before roughly this date various styles of long robes were in any case commonly worn by adult males of various sorts, so boys wearing them could probably not be said to form a distinct phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; until the late 19th or early 20th century, young boys in the [[Western world]] were [[Breeches|unbreeched]] and wore [[gown]]s or dresses until an age that varied between two and eight.&lt;ref&gt;Baumgarten, Linda: ''What Clothes Reveal: The Language of Clothing in Colonial and Federal America'', p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws that dictate how women must dress are seen by many international human rights organizations, such as [[Amnesty International]], as a form of gender discrimination.&lt;ref name="doc.es.amnesty.org"&gt;[https://doc.es.amnesty.org/cgi-bin/ai/BRSCGI/WOMENS%20RIGHT%20TO%20CHOOSE%20THEIR%20DRESS%20FREE%20OF%20COERCION?CMD=VEROBJ&amp;MLKOB=29309215959 Women’s right to choose their dress, free of coercion], Amnesty International, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International states that:&lt;ref name="doc.es.amnesty.org"/&gt;

:"Interpretations of religion, culture, or tradition cannot justify imposing rules about dress on those who choose to dress differently. States should take measures to protect individuals from being coerced to dress in specific ways by family members, community or religious groups or leaders."

In many places, women who do not dress in socially and legally proscribed ways are often subjected to violence—in particular, by the authorities (such as the [[religious police]]), by family members, or by the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6900111.stm | work=BBC News | title=Iran to intensify dress crackdown | date=July 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/1874471.stm | work=BBC News | title=Saudi police 'stopped' fire rescue | date=March 15, 2002|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production process also faces huge problems and negative criticisms relating to gender. In the garment industry, approximately 80% of the workers are female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cleanclothes.org/issues/gender|title=Gender: Women workers mistreated — Clean Clothes Campaign|last=Davelaar|first=Geertjan|website=cleanclothes.org|language=en|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason that majority of garment production is located in Asia is because of the low labor cost. The female was usually treated poorly in factories. They are sexually harassed by managers or other male workers, low paid wages, violating trade unions rights and [[Pregnancy discrimination|discrimination]] against pregnant women. Whether female are pregnant, single, young or old, they are poorly treated in different ways. Plenty of the workers will remain quiet in order to keep their contract and continue working in the factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/03/11/work-faster-or-get-out/labor-rights-abuses-cambodias-garment-industry|title="Work Faster or Get Out"|date=2015-03-11|newspaper=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''The Second Sexism: Discrimination Against Men and Boys'' (2012), philosopher [[David Benatar]] states that "[t]he prevailing assumption is that where conscription is necessary, it is only men who should be conscripted and, similarly, that only males should be forced into combat". This, he believes, "is a sexist assumption".&lt;ref name=Benatar/&gt;{{Rp|102}}&lt;!-- Split from ":0"--&gt; Anthropologist Ayse Gül Altinay has commented that "given equal suffrage rights, there is no other citizenship practice that differentiates as radically between men and women as compulsory male conscription".&lt;ref name=Altinay&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Myth of the Military-Nation: Militarism, Gender, and Education in Turkey|last=Altinay|first=Ayse Gül|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|isbn=978-1-403-97936-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=keLIAAAAQBAJ|publication-date=December 10, 2004|date=2004-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|34}}
