'''Sexism''' is a set of beliefs claiming that real or alleged differences between women and men establishing the superiority of one sex over the other.&lt;ref&gt;[Doob, Christopher B. 2013. Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as discrimination or devaluation based on a person's sex,  as in restricted job opportunities; especially, such discrimination directed against women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sexism?s=t]&lt;/ref&gt; Sexist attitudes are frequently based on beliefs in traditional stereotypes of [[gender roles]]. Sexism is not just a matter of individual attitudes, but is built into many societal institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Macionis, Gerber, John, Linda (2010). Sociology 7th Canadian Ed. Toronto, Ontario: Pearson Canada Inc.. pp. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; These institutions help transmit sexism through the process of [[social reproduction]]. The term ''sexism'' is most often used in relation to discrimination against women.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sexism?show=0&amp;t=1308304677&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sexism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sexist&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Sexism.aspx "Sexism"], ''Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sexism?view=uksexism&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexism involves disdain of, or prejudice towards, a sex as a whole or the application of gender [[stereotype]]s.

==Generalization and partition==
{{section OR|date=January 2012}}
In philosophy, a sexist attitude is one which suggests human beings can be understood or judged on the basis of the [[essentialism|essential characteristics]] of the group to which an individual belongs&amp;mdash;in this case as either men or women. This assumes that all individuals fit into the category of male or female and does not take into account people who identify as neither or both.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Gender stereotypes==
[[Image:Bettie Page driving.jpg|thumb|300px|A 1952 magazine feature stereotyping women drivers.]]
Gender stereotypes are widely held beliefs about the characteristics and behavior of women and men and transgender people.&lt;ref&gt;Manstead, A. S. R.; Hewstone, Miles; et al. ''The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Social Psychology''. Oxford, UK; Cambridge, Mass., USA: Blackwell, 1999, 1995, pp. 256 &amp;ndash; 57, ISBN 978-0-631-22774-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Gender stereotypes are not only descriptive, but also prescriptive beliefs about "how men and women should be and behave". Members of any gender who deviate from prescriptive gender stereotypes are punished. Assertive women; for example, are called "bitches," whereas men who lack physical strength are seen as "wimps" or "sissies".&lt;ref&gt;Dividio, John F.; et al. [http://books.google.com/books?id=VlvzONHZKrQC&amp;pg=PA334 ''The SAGE Handbook of Prejudice, Stereotyping and Discrimination'']. London; Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE, 2010, p, 334, ISBN 978-1-4129-3453-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Empirical studies have found widely shared cultural beliefs that men are more socially valued and more competent than women at most things{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}. As well as specific assumptions that men are better at some particular tasks (e.g., mechanical tasks) while women are better at others (e.g., nurturing tasks).&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Michael, M. Teresa Pizzamiglio and Lauren Mount (1996). ''Status, Communality and Agency: Implications for Stereotypes of Gender and Other Groups.'' Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol. 71, No. 1, pp. 25-38, {{doi|10.1037/0022-3514.71.1.25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, David G. and Joseph Berger (1997). ''Gender and Interpersonal Task Behaviors: Status Expectation Accounts.'' Sociological Perspectives, Vol. 40, No. 1, pp. 1-32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, John E. and Deborah L. Best. ''Measuring Sex Stereotypes: A Multinational Study.'' Newbury Park, CA: Sage, 1990, ISBN 978-0-8039-3815-1.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Susan Fiske|Fiske]] and her colleagues surveyed nine diverse samples, from different regions of the United States, and found that members of these samples, regardless of age, consistently rated the category "men" higher than the category "women" on a multidimensional scale of competence.&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, Susan T., Amy J. C. Cuddy, Peter Glick, Jun Xu (2002). [http://www.nd.edu/~wcarbona/Fiske-et-al-2002.pdf ''A Model of (Often Mixed) Stereotype Content: Competence and Warmth Respectively Follow From Perceived Status and Competition.''] Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol. 82, No. 6, p. 892.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender stereotypes can facilitate and impede intellectual performance. For instance, [[stereotype threat]]s can lower women's performance on mathematics tests be due to the stereotype that women have inferior quantitative skills compared to men's.&lt;ref&gt;Shih, Margaret, Todd L. Pittinsky and Nalini Ambady (1999). [https://www.amherst.edu/media/view/120864/original/Shin%2Bet%2Bal--stereotype%2Bsusceptibility.pdf ''Stereotype Susceptibility: Identity, Salience and Shifts in Quantitative Performance.''] Psychological Science, Vol. 10, No. 1, pp. 80-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Claude M. Steele|Steele, Claude M.]] (1997). [http://www.nber.org/sewp/events/2005.01.14/Bios+Links/Krieger-rec5-Steele_Threat-in-the-Air.pdf ''A Threat Is in the Air: How Stereotypes Shape Intellectual Identity and Performance.''] American Psychologist, Vol. 52, No. 6, pp. 613-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypes can also affect the assessments people make of their own competence. Studies found that specific stereotypes (e.g., women have lower mathematical abilities) affect women's and men’s perceptions of those abilities such that men assess their own task ability higher than women performing at the same level. These "biased self-assessments" have far-reaching effects because they can shape men and women’s educational and career decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Correll, Shelley J. (2001). [http://www.chaire-crsng-inal.fsg.ulaval.ca/fileadmin/docs/documents/Article/Gender_and_career_choice_process_2001.pdf ''Gender and the career choice process: The role of biased self-assessments.''] American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 106, Issue 6, pp. 1691-1730.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Correll, Shelley J. (2004).

Gender stereotypes are sometimes applied and created at an early age. Various interventions were reviewed including the use of fiction in challenging gender stereotypes. One study was done by A. Wing in which children were read ''[[Bill's New Frock]]'' by [[Anne Fine]] and then discussed its content. Wing observed that children were able to articulate, and reflect on their stereotypical constructions of gender and those in the world at large. There was evidence of children considering 'the different treatment that boys and girls receive' during classroom discussion which enabled and encouraged them to challenge those stereotypes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

As a result of many gender stereotypes, women are more likely to be raped than men{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}. The only country in which the numbers even come close is the United States, almost exclusively because of the massive scale of the United States penitentiary system and its ingrained rape culture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/feb/21/us-more-men-raped-than-women&lt;/ref&gt;

==In language==
{{See also|Gender-neutral language}}

===Sexist and gender-neutral language===
Research has found that the use of ''he'' as a generic pronoun evokes a disproportionate number of male images and excludes thoughts of women in non gender-specific instances.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Megan M. and Lorie E. James (2009). [http://www.jstor.org/pss/27784423 ''Is the generic pronoun he still comprehended as excluding women?''] American Journal of Psychology, Vol. 122, No. 4, pp. 483-496.&lt;/ref&gt; Results also suggest that while the plural ''they'' functions as a generic pronoun for both males and females, males may comprehend ''he/she'' in a manner similar to ''he,'' as ''he'' usually is placed before the dash and ''she'' after.  This is usually done because the word ''she'' already contains the word ''he'' so it is positioned after the dash. This is a linguistic convention, not one driven by mainstream gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;Gastil, John (1990) [http://www.springerlink.com/content/u817g2142392445v/ ''Generic Pronouns and sexist language: The oxymoronic character of masculine generics.''] Sex Roles, Vol. 23, Nos. 11/12, pp. 629-643.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearing the end of the 20th century, there is a rise in gender-neutral language in western worlds, which is often attributed to the rise of [[feminism]]. [[Gender-neutral language]] is the avoidance of [[gender-specific job title]]s, non parallel usage, and other usage that is considered by some to be sexist. Supporters claim that having gender–specific titles and gender–specific pronouns either implies a systemic bias to exclude individuals based on their gender or else as unnecessary in most cases as race-specific pronouns, religion-specific pronouns, or persons-height-specific pronouns. Some of those who support gender-specific pronouns assert that promoting gender-neutral language is a kind of "[[semantics]] injection" itself.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Anthropological linguistics and gender-specific language===
Unlike the [[Indo-European languages]] in the west, for many other [[languages]] around the world, [[gender-specific pronouns]] are a recent phenomenon that occurred around the early 20th century. As a result of [[colonialism]], cultural revolution occurred in many parts of the world with attempts to "modernize" and "westernize" by adding gender-specific pronouns and animate-inanimate pronouns to local languages. This resulted in the situation of what was [[gender-neutral pronouns]] a century ago suddenly becoming gender–specific. (See for example [[Gender-neutrality in languages without grammatical gender#Turkish|Gender-neutrality in languages without grammatical gender: Turkish]].)

===Gender-specific pejorative terms===
Gender–specific pejorative terms intimidate or harm another person because of their gender. Sexism can be expressed in a pseudo–subtle manner through the attachment of terms which have negative gender oriented implications,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anti-bullyingalliance.org.uk/pdf/SST%20Quick%20Guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; such as through [[Disdain|condescension]]. Many examples include swear words. &lt;!-- Do not list swear words here. --&gt;

An example is the uninformative attribution of the term 'hag' for a woman or 'fairy' for a man. Although hag and fairy both have non-sexist interpretations, when they are used in the context of a gender–specific pejorative term these words become representations of sexist attitudes.

Misgendering men using female-gendered pejoratives is another representation of such attitudes. When men are accused of possessing female attributes in common slurs like "effeminate", "pussy", "mangina", "sissy", "girly", "fairy", "cunt", and "bitch" (which takes on a different meaning when used on a man than when used on a woman), we are reminded that to be female is a step down from being male{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}. There are almost no male-gendered slurs commonly used against women in this manner, since being male is seen as a step up from being female{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}. In fact women are often complimented by misgendering: "she's got balls", "she's a tomboy", and so on. Although it could be said that words such as "butch" and "manly" are used prejoratively against women to indicate masculine characteristics. 
====Transgender====
Many words are considered offensive to transgender people. These include words like tranny, she-male or he-she. Misgendering is also considered deeply pejorative as well as using 'it' pronouns.

==Relationship between rape and misogyny==
Research into the factors which motivate perpetrators of [[rape]] against women frequently reveals patterns of hatred of women and pleasure in inflicting psychological and/or physical trauma, rather than sexual interest.&lt;ref name=Lisak1988&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lisak, D.  |authorlink=David Lisak | coauthors = Roth, S. | year = 1988  | title = Motivational factors in nonincarcerated sexually aggressive men | journal = J Pers Soc Psychol  | volume = 55 | issue = 5 | pages = 795–802 | pmid = 3210146 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.55.5.795}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers have argued that rape is not the result of pathological individuals, but rather systems of male dominance, cultural practices and beliefs that objectify and degrade women.&lt;ref name=Odem&gt;{{Cite book | author=Odem, Mary E.; | coauthors=Clay-Warner, Jody | title=Confronting rape and sexual assault | year=1998 | publisher=Scholarly Resources | location=Wilmington, Del.  | isbn=978-0-8420-2599-7 | pages=i-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mary Odem, Jody Clay-Warner and Susan Brownwiller consider sexist attitudes to be propagated by a series of myths about rape and rapists.&lt;ref name=Brownmiller&gt;{{Cite book | author=Brownmiller, Susan | title=Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape | year=1992 | publisher=Penguin Books, Limited | location=New York  | isbn=978-0-14-013986-0 | page=480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Odem, Mary E.; | coauthors=Clay-Warner, Jody | title=Confronting rape and sexual assault | year=1998 | publisher=Scholarly Resources | location=Wilmington, Del.  | isbn=978-0-8420-2599-7 | pages=130–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They state that contrary to those myths, rapists often plan a rape before they choose a victim&lt;ref name="Odem"/&gt; and that [[acquaintance rape]] is the most common form of rape rather than assault by a stranger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Odem, Mary E.; | coauthors=Clay-Warner, Jody | title=Confronting rape and sexual assault | year=1998 | publisher=Scholarly Resources | location=Wilmington, Del.  | isbn=978-0-8420-2599-7 | page=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bohmer&gt;{{Cite book | editor=Parrot, Andrea; Bechhofer, Laurie | author=Bohmer, Carol | chapter=Acquaintance rape and the law | title=Acquaintance rape: the hidden crime | year=1991 | publisher=Wiley | location=New York  | isbn=978-0-471-51023-9 | pages=317–333}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Odem also states that these rape myths propagate sexist attitudes about men by perpetuating the thought that men cannot control their sexuality.&lt;ref name=Odem&gt;{{Cite book | author=Odem, Mary E.; | coauthors=Clay-Warner, Jody | title=Confronting rape and sexual assault | year=1998 | publisher=Scholarly Resources | location=Wilmington, Del.  | isbn=978-0-8420-2599-7 | page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to [[acquaintance rape]], the "Men Can Stop Rape" movement has been implemented.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mencanstoprape.org/&lt;/ref&gt;  The US military has started a similar movement with the tagline "My strength is for defending."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=13379&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occupational sexism==
{{Main|Occupational sexism}}
Occupational sexism refers to any [[discriminatory]] practices, statements, actions, etc. based on a person's [[sex]] that are present or occur in a place of [[employment]]. One form of occupational sexism is [[wage discrimination]]. 

In 2008, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD) found that while female employment rates have expanded considerably and the gender employment and wage gaps have narrowed virtually everywhere, on average, women still have 20% less of a chance to have a job and are paid 17% less than men.&lt;ref name="oecd1"/&gt; Moreover, the report stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;[In] many countries, labour market [[discrimination]] – i.e. the unequal treatment of equally productive individuals only because they belong to a specific group – is still a crucial factor inflating disparities in employment and the quality of job opportunities [...] Evidence presented in this edition of the ''Employment Outlook'' suggests that about 8% of the variation in gender employment gaps and 30% of the variation in gender wage gaps across OECD countries can be explained by discriminatory practihappyn the labour market."&lt;ref name="oecd1"&gt;[[OECD]]. [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/8/19/40937574.pdf ''OECD Employment Outlook - 2008 Edition Summary in English''.] OECD, Paris, 2008, p. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oecd2"&gt;[[OECD]]. [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/36/17/43244511.pdf ''OECD Employment Outlook. Chapter 3: The Price of Prejudice: Labour Market Discrimination on the Grounds of Gender and Ethnicity''.] OECD, Paris, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report also found that despite the fact that almost all OECD countries, including the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Facts About Compensation Discrimination
|author=The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/fs-epa.html
|accessdate=2008-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; have established anti-discrimination laws, these laws are difficult to enforce.&lt;ref name="oecd1"/&gt;

===Gender stereotypes===
[[Gender role]]s (or sex roles) are attitudes and activities that a society links to each sex. A culture that defines males as ambitious and competitive encourages them to seek out positions of leadership and play team sports. To the extent that females are defined as deferential and emotional, they are expected to be supportive helpers and quick to show their feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Macionis, Gerber, John, Linda (2010). Sociology 7th Canadian Ed. Toronto, Ontario: Pearson Canada Inc.. pp. 300.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2012}}

According to the [[OECD]], women's labor market behavior "is influenced by learned cultural and social values that may be thought to discriminate against women (and sometimes against men) by stereotyping certain work and life styles as 'male' or 'female'." Further, the OECD argues that women's educational choices "may be dictated, at least in part, by their expectations that [certain] types of employment opportunities are not available to them, as well as by gender stereotypes that are prevalent in society."&lt;ref name="oecd.org" /&gt;

There is a long record of women being excluded from participation in many professions. Often, women have gained entry into a previously male profession only to be faced with additional obstacles. [[Elizabeth Blackwell]], the first woman to receive an M.D. in the [[United States]] and [[Myra Bradwell]], the first female lawyer in the state of [[Illinois]], illustrate the prevalence of women being excluded from certain professions and the changing culture.

Professional discrimination continues today according to studies done by [[Cornell University]] and others{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}. Some have hypothesized that gender bias has been influencing which scientific research gets published{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}. This hypothesis coincides with a test conducted at the [[University of Toronto]] led by Amber Budden. The study showed that, in the journal ''Behavioral Ecology'', after implementation of double-blind review in which both the author and reviewer identity is concealed, there was an increase of 7.9% in the number of papers authored by women. This was more than three times the increase of female ecology graduate students in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csz-scz.ca/documents/news/scientific_reviews.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1833, women working in factories earned only one-quarter of men's wages, and in 2007, women's median annual paychecks reflected only $0.78 for every $1.00 earned by men. A study showed women comprised 87% of workers in the child care industry and 86% of the health aide industry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.now.org/issues/economic/factsheet.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Some experts believe that parents play an important role in the creation of values and perceptions of their children. The fact that many girls are asked to help their mothers do housework, while many boys do technical tasks with their fathers, seems to influence their behavior and can sometimes discourage girls from performing such tasks. Girls will then think that each gender should have a specific role and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.discriminations.us/2006/09/fighting_gender_bias_in_scienc.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2009/02/gender_bias_and_science.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fasebj.org/content/20/9/1284.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=401046&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 study found that being overweight harms women's career advancement, but presents no barrier for men. [[Overweight]] or [[obese]] women were significantly under-represented among company bosses, whereas a significant proportion of male executives were overweight or obese. The author of the study stated that the results suggest that "the 'glass ceiling effect' on women's advancement may reflect not only general negative stereotypes about the competencies of women, but also weight bias that results in the application of stricter appearance standards to women. Overweight women are evaluated more negatively than overweight men. There is a tendency to hold women to harsher weight standards."&lt;ref&gt;Roehling, Patricia V., Mark V. Roehling, Jeffrey D. Vandlen, Justin Blazek, William C. Guy (2009). ''Weight discrimination and the glass ceiling effect among top US CEOs.'' Equal Opportunity International, Vol. 28, Iss. 2, pp.179 - 196, {{doi|10.1108/02610150910937916}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moult, Julie. [http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/gender-divide-in-career-belly/story-e6frf7l6-1225697154065 ''Women's careers more tied to weight than men -- study.''] [[Herald Sun]], April 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

At other times, there are accusations that some traditionally female professions have been or are being eliminated by its roles being subsumed by a male dominated profession. The assumption of baby delivery roles by doctors with the subsequent decline of [[midwifery]] is sometimes claimed to be an example.

Transgender people are also often discrimated and harassed in their jobs. Unlike sex discrimination refusing to give someone a job or firing someone for their gender identity or expression is still legal in most states in the United States and most countries around the world.

===Wage gap===
{{Main|Gender pay gap}}
[[Image:EU 27 Gender Pay Gap.001.png|thumb|300px|Gender Pay Gap in average gross hourly earnings according to [[Eurostat]] 2008.&lt;ref name="EC stats" /&gt;]]
[[Eurostat]] found a persisting gender pay gap of 17.5% on average in the 27 [[Member state of the European Union|EU Member States]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="EC stats"&gt;[[European Commission]]. [http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/gender-pay-gap/situation-europe/index_en.htm ''The situation in the EU''.] Retrieved on August 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[OECD]] found that female full-time employees earned 17% less than their male counterparts across OECD countries in 2009.&lt;ref name="oecd1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oecd2"/&gt;

In the U.S., the female-to-male earnings ratio was 0.77 in 2009, meaning that, in 2009, female full-time, year round (FTYR) workers earned 77% as much as male FYTR workers. Women's earnings relative to men's fell from 1960 to 1980 (from 60.7 percent to 60.2%) and then rose rapidly from 1980 to 1990 (from 60.2% to 71.6%), and less rapidly from 1990 to 2000 (from 71.6% to 73.7%) and from 2000 to 2009 (from 73.7% to 77.0%).&lt;ref name="census 2009"&gt;U.S. Census Bureau.

[http://www.iwpr.org/publications/pubs/the-gender-wage-gap-2009 ''The Gender Wage Gap: 2009''.] Retrieved March 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time when the first [[Equal Pay Act]] was passed in 1963, female full-time workers earned 58.9% as much as male full-time workers.&lt;ref name="census 2009"/&gt;

The gender pay gap has been attributed to differences in personal and workplace characteristics between women and men (education, hours worked, occupation etc.) as well as direct and indirect discrimination in the labor market (gender stereotypes, customer and employer bias, etc.). For example, women may interrupt their careers to take on child-rearing responsibilities more frequently than men.&lt;ref&gt;The Open University: Learning Space.[http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ECON303-8.2.1.pdf “Economics Explains Discrimination in the Labour Market."] Accessed June 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies always find that some portion of the gender pay gap remains unexplained even after controlling factors that are assumed to influence earnings. The unexplained portion of the wage gap is attributed to gender discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee]]. [http://jec.senate.gov/public/?a=Files.Serve&amp;File_id=9118a9ef-0771-4777-9c1f-8232fe70a45c ''Invest in Women, Invest in America: A Comprehensive Review of Women in the U.S. Economy.''] Washington, DC, December 2010, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The estimates for the discriminatory component of the gender pay gap vary widely. The OECD estimated that approximately 30% of the gender pay gaps across OECD countries is due to discrimination.&lt;ref name="oecd1"/&gt; Australian research shows that discrimination accounts for approximately 60% of the wage differentials between women and men.&lt;ref name="natsem"&gt;National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling.

It has been said that wage discrimination is in direct contradiction with the economic concept of [[supply and demand]]. That states, if a good or service (in the case labor) is in demand and has value then it will find it's price in the market. For example if someone could offer equal value for less pay then by the concept of supply and demand there would be a higher demand for the cheaper (lower paid) workers as they offer an equal service for a more competitive price. If a business hired just females at a lower wage for equal work then it would lower the costs of that business and give the business a [[Competitive advantage]]. Under the concept of supply and demand, if women were offering equal value then demand and price should naturally rise as they are offering a better price for their service than men.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swifteconomics.com/2009/09/21/lies-damned-lies-and-statistics-the-wage-gap/&lt;/ref&gt;

Research done at [[Cornell University]] and elsewhere indicates that mothers are less likely to get hired than equally qualified fathers and if hired, would be paid a lower salary than male applicants with children.&lt;ref&gt;Folbre, Nancy.

===Glass ceiling===
{{Main|Glass ceiling}}
The term "glass ceiling" is used to describe a perceived barrier to advancement based on discrimination, particularly gender discrimination. In academic achievement, great improvements have been made. However, as of 1995 in the United States, women received about half of all Masters degrees, but 95 to 97% of the senior managers of Fortune 1000 Industrial and Fortune 500 companies were male and in the Fortune 2000 Industrial and service companies, only 5% of senior managers were women.&lt;ref name="DOL2"&gt;Federal Glass Ceiling Commission. [http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/reich/reports/ceiling2.pdf ''Solid Investments: Making Full Use of the Nation's Human Capital''.] Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Labor, November 1995, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] asserts "progress in bringing women into leadership and decision making positions around the world remains far too slow."&lt;ref name="UN-IWD2006"&gt;{{cite web

Even in the Western World, until recently, women's employment was very restricted. For instance, in [[France]], married women got the right to work without their husband's permission only in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/explore/cmcf-vsi-women-in-france.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parisvoice.com/-archives-97-86/282-frances-leading-women-show-the-way&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.womeninworldhistory.com/TWR-07.html&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Western Germany]] women obtained this right only in 1977 (by comparison women in [[Eastern Germany]] had much more rights).&lt;ref&gt;.http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/world/europe/06iht-letter.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.356386.de/dp998.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Spain]], during Franco's era, a married woman needed her husband's consent, referred to as the ''permiso marital'', for almost all economic activities, including employment, ownership of property, and even traveling away from home; the ''permiso marital'' was abolished in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;http://countrystudies.us/spain/43.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectification==
Some argue that [[sexual objectification]] is a form of sexism. Some countries, such as [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]], have laws against sexual objectification in advertising. Nudity itself is not banned, and nude people can be used to advertise a product, but only if they are relevant to what is being advertised. Sol Olving, head of Norway's Kreativt Forum, an association of the country's top advertising agencies, explained, "You could have a naked person advertising shower gel or a cream, but not a woman in a bikini draped across a car."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7365722.stm | work=BBC News | title=Scandinavian split on sexist ads | date=2008-04-25 | accessdate=2010-04-06 | first=Stephanie | last=Holmes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pornography===
{{See also|Feminist views on pornography}}
It is sometimes asserted that [[pornography]] contributes to sexism by objectifying women and portraying them in submissive roles.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, Catharine (1987). ''Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Writers such as [[Robin Morgan]] and [[Catharine MacKinnon]] suggest that certain types of pornography also contribute to [[violence against women]] by eroticizing scenes in which women are dominated, coerced, humiliated, or even [[sexually assault]]ed.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Robin. (1974). "Theory and Practice: Pornography and Rape". In: ''Going Too Far: The Personal Chronicle of a Feminist''. (1977). Random House. 333 p. ISBN 0-394-48227-1. (1978 ed, ISBN 0-394-72612-X.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mackinnon-guardian&gt;{{Cite news| last = Jeffries| first = Stuart| title = Are women human?

Some anti-pornography feminists, such as MacKinnon, charge that the production of pornography entails physical, psychological, and/or economic [[coercion]] of the women who perform and model in it.&lt;ref name=stanford-shrage&gt;Shrage, Laurie. (2007-07-13). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-sex-markets/#Por "Feminist Perspectives on Sex Markets: Pornography"].

''Toward a Feminist Theory of the State'' Harvard University Press. ISBN 0-674-89645-9 (1st ed), ISBN 0-674-89646-7 (2nd ed). "Sex forced on real women so that it can be sold at a profit to be forced on other real women; women's bodies trussed and maimed and raped and made into things to be hurt and obtained and accessed, and this presented as the nature of women; the coercion that is visible and the coercion that has become invisible—this and more grounds the feminist concern with pornography"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{Cite episode| title = A Conversation With Catherine MacKinnon (transcript)| series = [[Think Tank]]|network= PBS| accessdate = 2009-09-01| year = 1995| url = http://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript215.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Opponents of pornography charge that pornography presents a severely distorted image of sexual relations and reinforces sex myths. It often shows women as readily available and willing to engage in sex at any time, with any men, on men's terms, and always responding positively to any advance men make. Catherine MacKinnon states that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/apr/12/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Stuart | last=Jeffries | title=Stuart Jeffries talks to leading feminist Catharine MacKinnon | date=April 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Pornography affects people's belief in rape myths. So for example if a woman says 'I didn't consent' and people have been viewing pornography, they believe rape myths and believe the woman did consent no matter what she said. That when she said no, she meant yes. When she said she didn't want to, that meant more beer. When she said she would prefer to go home, that means she's a lesbian who needs to be given a good corrective experience. Pornography promotes these rape myths and desensitises people to violence against women so that you need more violence to become sexually aroused if you're a pornography consumer. This is very well documented.}}

Many fetishest also see transgender people as nothing more than a fetish as well and oftentimes will also use derogatarory terms in pornography and other sex industries to refer to them.

==Historical examples of gender discrimination==
Certain forms of sex discrimination are illegal in some countries, while in other countries sex discrimination may be legally sanctioned under various circumstances.&lt;ref name="Neuwirth"&gt;Neuwirth, Jessica (2004). [http://www.msmagazine.com/summer2004/globalwomenlaw.asp "Unequal: A Global Perspective on Women Under the Law"]. ''Ms. Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most countries don't protect from discrimination based on gender identity or expression and trans people still face an immense amount of discrimination.

===Coverture===
{{main|coverture}}
U.S. and [[English law]] subscribed until the 20th century to the system of [[coverture]], where "by marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law; that is the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage."&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone, William. ''Commentaries on the Laws of England.''http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/xBlack.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Not until 1875 were women in the U.S. legally defined as persons (''Minor v Happersett'', 88 U.S. 162).&lt;ref name="legacy98.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy98.org/timeline.html |title=Legacy '98: Detailed Timeline |publisher=Legacy98.org |date=2001-09-19 |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, women still lose significant legal rights during [[marriage]]. For example, in [[Chile]] "the marital partnership is to be headed by the husband, who shall administer the spouses' joint property as well as the property owned by his wife."&lt;ref name="Neuwirth"/&gt;

===Gender discrimination in voting and political candidacy===
[[Suffrage]] is the civil right to vote. Gender is sometimes used as a criterion for the right to vote.

Some Western countries allowed women the right to vote only a few decades ago: in [[Switzerland]] women gained the right to vote in federal elections only in 1971,&lt;ref name="switzerland-chronology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html |title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology |publisher=History-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch |date= |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Swiss canton of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] became the last Swiss canton to grant women the right to vote on local issues - it did so only in 1991, when it was forced by the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/WOM1373.doc.htm |title=United Nations press release of a meeting of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), issued on 14 January 2003 |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[France|French]] women were granted the right to vote in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Pierre Maury |url=http://mjp.univ-perp.fr/france/co1944-2.htm |title=Ordonnance du 21 avril 1944 relative à l'organisation des pouvoirs publics en France après la Libération |publisher=Mjp.univ-perp.fr |date= |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/femmes/citoyennete_politique_de-Gaulle.asp |title=La citoyenneté politique des femmes&amp;nbsp;– La décision du Général de Gaulle |author=Assemblée nationale |accessdate=2007-12-19 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Women's suffrage in the United States|Women's suffrage in the U.S.]] was achieved gradually at state and local levels during the 19th and early 20th centuries, culminating in 1920 with the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], which provided: "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex."

Since women have gained the right to vote through the Nineteenth Amendment, females have emerged in the field of politics whether in local or state politics or as presidential candidates. Although women certainly have the capability to successfully gain political power, gender stereotypes are evident in politics or candidacy. Data from the 2006 American National Election Studies Pilot Study measured "perceptions of women's and men's issue competency.&lt;ref name=Sanbonmatsu&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sanbonmatsu|first=Kira|coauthors=Kathleen Dolan|title=Do Gender Stereotypes Transcend Party?|journal=Political Research Quarterly|year=2009|month=September|volume=62|issue=3|pages=485–494}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a question that was asked was "Who would do a better job in the U.S. Congress handling crime - a Democrat who is a man, a Democrat who is a woman or would they equally do a good or bad job?"&lt;ref name=Sanbonmatsu /&gt;  The same question was rephrased to say "a Republican..." The data shows that voters hold gender stereotypes for both Democrats and Republicans. Specifically, when asked the previous question, voters stated that the male would do a better job in handling crime. Meanwhile, when "handling crime" was changed to "handling education," voters said that women would do a better job. The reason why the voters responded in such a manner is because "women politicians are perceived to possess typically feminine traits such as being warm and sensitive and are believed to be expert on 'so called' woman issues such as education. Moreover, men politicians are perceived to possess typically masculine traits, such as being assertive and tough."&lt;ref name=Sanbonmatsu /&gt; The data specifically shows that about 2% of the voters (average: 1.9% Democrats in congress, 2.3% Republicans in congress) believed that men would do a better job handling education while about 6.4% of voters (average 6.8% Democrats in congress, 6.2% Republicans in congress) said that women would do a better job handling education. While voters may believe that women do a better job in areas than men and vice versa, the survey then limits the analysis to respondents that associate with a specific political party. When Republicans were asked the same questions regarding issue competency in education and crime, the results show that about 26% of Democratic women state that female Democratic politicians would do a better job handling education while just under 20% of Republican women held the same belief. Meanwhile, more Republicans believed that Republican men are better able to handle crime (36% of voters) while Democrats believed that Democratic men were not as able (14% of voters).&lt;ref name=Sanbonmatsu /&gt;

The scientists conclude that "although it is often argued that any gender effect will disappear in the presence of the party cue, [they] find that gender stereotypes transcend party. Both Democratic and Republican politicians are believed to differ by gender in perceived issue competency and issue positions... Democrats are more likely to hold gender stereotypes that benefit women in politics. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to see an advantage for women on the issue of education and are less likely than Republicans to see a men advantage on the issue of crime."&lt;ref name=Sanbonmatsu /&gt; Therefore, while Democrats are more likely to believe that women are better able to handle education, Republicans believe that men are better able to handle crime. "Overall, gender stereotypes appear to be more detrimental to the electoral chances of Republican women than Democratic women. In the end, this research offers support for the notion that women and men who run for office are viewed through multiple lenses by a public employing a range of stereotypes to the degree that people continue to see women and men as possessing different issue competencies."&lt;ref name=Sanbonmatsu /&gt; This is clearly sexist because in a politically and socially correct world, women would be considered just as capable of handling crime than men, but unfortunately, citizens view issue competencies based on gender. This is also split by political parties because, based on the data and conclusions, Democrats believe that women are better able to handle education while Republicans believe that men are better fit to handle crime.&lt;ref name=Sanbonmatsu /&gt;

[[Wife selling|Selling a wife]], largely historical, is a sexist custom.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Alvin John, ''Veiled and Silenced: How Culture Shaped Sexist Theology'' (Macon, Ga.: Mercer Univ. Press, 1989 (pbk. ISBN 0-86554-327-5 &amp; casebound ISBN 0-86554-329-1)), esp. pp. 124–129 (author sociologist).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Sexism can take many forms, sometimes quite subtle or unconscious. For example, the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] reports in its survey of American civic art (2011) that there are 5,193 public statues in the U.S. which depict individuals – of these, only 394 depict females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= |first1= |date=July, 2011 |title=Harper's Index |journal=[[Harper's]] |publisher=Harper's Foundation |volume=323 |issue=1,934 |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic violence===
{{Main|Domestic violence|violence against women|violence against men}}
Domestic violence takes on many different forms which include verbal, physical and psychological abuse. Domestic violence occurs in unequal proportion in men and women and is often considered related to sexism. {{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The types of violence (physical, psychological, sexual) also differ in proportion across the gender spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;[[Domestic violence]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Honor killings]] are a form of domestic violence that continue to be practiced in several parts of the world.

According to the report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the 58th session of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] (2002) concerning cultural practices in the family that reflect violence against women (E/CN.4/2002/83):

:The Special Rapporteur indicated that there had been contradictory decisions with regard to the honour defense in [[Brazil]], and that legislative provisions allowing for partial or complete defense in that context could be found in the penal codes of [[Argentina]], [[Ecuador]], [[Egypt]], [[Guatemala]], [[Iran]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Peru]], [[Syria]], [[Venezuela]] and the [[Palestinian National Authority]].&lt;ref name="unhchr"/&gt;

[[Stoning]], a form of capital punishment whereby a group throws stones at a person until the person dies, is often connected to domestic disputes, especially involving accusations of loss of chastity, or adultery, or refusing arranged marriages. Recently, several people have been sentenced to death by stoning after being accused of adultery in Iran, Somalia, Afghanistan, Sudan, Mali, and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/25/iran-stoning-woman-adultery_n_1169429.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8366197.stm |title=Somali woman stoned for adultery |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-11-18 |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Robert Tait and Noushin Hoseiny |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jul/21/iran.humanrights |title=Eight women and a man face stoning in Iran for adultery |work= The Guardian |date= 2008-07-21|accessdate=2010-06-24 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,479752,00.html "Two Men Stoned to Death for Adultery in Iran".]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-10983494 | work=BBC News | title=Taliban 'kill adulterous Afghan couple' | date=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rawa.org/temp/runews/2011/01/27/woman-stoned-to-death-in-north-afghanistan.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/31/sudanese-woman-stoning-death-adultery | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=David | last=Smith | title=Sudanese woman sentenced to stoning death over adultery claims | date=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/02/world/africa/mali-couple-stoned/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/18/couple-sentenced-pakistan&lt;/ref&gt;

Practices such as honor killings and stoning continue to be openly supported by many mainstream politicians and other officials in certain countries. For instance, in [[Pakistan]], after the 2008 [[Balochistan honour killings]], when five women were killed by tribesmen of the [[Umrani|Umrani Tribe]] of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], the [[Pakistan|Pakistan's]] Federal Minister for Postal Services, [[Israr Ullah Zehri]], defended the practice; he stated:&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4678530.ece |title=Three teenagers buried alive in 'honour killings' |accessdate=2008-09-05 |work=Times Online | location=London | first=Zahid | last=Hussain | date=2008-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/2660881/Pakistani-women-buried-alive-for-choosing-husbands.html |title=Pakistani women buried alive 'for choosing husbands'|accessdate=2008-09-01 |work=Telegraph | location=London | date=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''These are centuries-old traditions, and I will continue to defend them. Only those who indulge in immoral acts should be afraid.''" Following the 2006 case of [[Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani]], which has put [[Iran]] under international pressure over stoning sentences, [[Mohammad-Javad Larijani]], a senior envoy and chief of Iran’s Human Rights Council, defended the practice of stoning, claiming it was a "lesser punishment" than ordinary execution, because it allowed the convicted a chance to survive.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/International/outrage-iran-human-rights-officials-defense-stoning/story?id=12193085#.UE4Qi64Zh0I&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE)'s Supreme Court has ruled that a man has the right to physically discipline his wife and children as long as he doesn't leave physical marks.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.cnn.com/2010-10-19/world/uae.court.ruling_1_islamic-law-sharia-law-ruling?_s=PM:WORLD&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hate-motivated sexual assault===
Rape and sexual assault are considered to be acts of hate. Their relationship to sexism is that there is often a desire for the perpetrator to feel power over the other due to the sex.  Additionally, the Center for Women Policy Studies stated that "victims almost always are chosen for what they are rather than who they are," meaning that a woman is most likely being attacked because of her gender, not who she is as a person.&lt;ref&gt;The National Center for Victims of Crime&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Women in the past have generally been disadvantaged from higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Barbara Miller. ''In the Company of Educated Women.''&lt;/ref&gt; When women were admitted to higher education they were encouraged to major in subjects that were considered less intellectual; the study of [[English literature]] in American and British colleges and universities was in fact instituted as a field of study considered suitable to women's "lesser intellects".&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, Terry. ''Literary Theory.''&lt;/ref&gt; This has changed however and since 1991 the proportion of young women enrolled in college in the U.S. has exceeded the enrollment rate for young men, and the gap has widened over time.&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Education Statistics, http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2005/2005028.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Women now make up the majority—54%—of the 10.8 million young adults enrolled in college in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prb.org/Articles/2007/CrossoverinFemaleMaleCollegeEnrollmentRates.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Research studies have found that discrimination continues today: boys receive more attention and praise in the classroom in grade school along with more blame and punishment,&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, Diane F. ''Sex differences in cognitive abilities.'' Laurence Erlbaum Associates, 2000. ISBN 080582792. Page 259.&lt;/ref&gt; and "this pattern of more active teacher attention directed at male students continues at the postsecondary level".&lt;ref&gt;Sadker, Myra, and David Sadker. "Confronting Sexism in the College Classroom." In ''Gender in the Classroom: Power and Pedagogy.'' Ed. Susan L. Gabriel and Isaiah Smithson. Page 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, female students speak less and less in classroom settings.&lt;ref&gt;Sadker, Myra, and David Sadker. "Failing at Fairness: Hidden Lessons." In ''Mapping the social landscape: readings in sociology.'' Ed. Sandra J. Ferguson, [[Susan J. Ferguson]]. Taylor &amp; Francies, 1999. ISBN 0-7674-0616-8. Page 350.&lt;/ref&gt;

Girls earn higher grades than boys until the end of high school. Girls in some districts achieve higher marks despite scoring the same or lower than boys on standardised tests.&lt;ref&gt;Public Policy Sources, http://www.fraserinstitute.org/commerce.web/product_files/BoysGirlsandGradesIntro.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military service===
Military service is an area where gender roles have often been considered paramount.&lt;ref&gt;[[Military service]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some countries, like [[Israel]], have mandatory military service regardless of gender.&lt;ref&gt;[[Israel#Military]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, other countries still use a system of [[conscription]] only requiring military service for males, even when women are permitted to serve voluntarily. 

In the U.S., women are prohibited from serving in active ground combat. However, in the current wars in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]], "the unpredictable nature of the attacks in this war blurs the distinction between front-line and rear areas ... [women] find themselves in the thick of the battle." Initially, women deployed in support roles were not trained in active service. This created an imbalanced dangerous situation for women and now all soldiers receive the same combat training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14869648|Brenda Moore]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some experts purport that women's perceived role as a sub-class of soldier encourages sexual violence against women in the military. In the U.S., the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]'s new Sexual Assault Prevention and Response office is addressing these concerns.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sapr.mil/&lt;/ref&gt;

Obviously prohibiting women in combat roles increases male participation in those roles, putting more males at risk, which is one example of a significant male disadvantage due to sexism.

In the United States transgender people are not allowed to serve openly in the military. When don't ask, don't tell was taken down it had no effect on transgender people's military service.

===War rape===
{{Main|War rape}}
War rapes are [[rape]]s committed by soldiers, other combatants or civilians during armed conflict, [[war]], or military occupation, distinguished from sexual assaults and rape committed amongst troops in military service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theconservativeblog.co.uk/?p=2382 "30% of Women in USA Military Raped Whilst Serving by Fellow Soldiers"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103844570 "The Nation: The Plight of Women Soldiers"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3848/ "Why Soldiers Rape - Culture of misogyny, illegal occupation, fuel sexual violence in military"]&lt;/ref&gt; It also covers the situation where women are forced into prostitution or [[sexual slavery]] by an occupying power, as in the case of Japanese [[comfort women]] during World War II.

===Sexual slavery===
{{Main|Sexual slavery}}
Sexual slavery takes place when people are coerced into [[slavery]] for [[Human sexual activity|sexual]] [[exploitation]]. The incidence of sexual slavery by country has been studied and tabulated by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]), with the cooperation of various international agencies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unescobkk.org/fileadmin/user_upload/culture/Trafficking/project/Graph_Worldwide_Sept_2004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual slavery may include single owner sexual slavery, ritual slavery sometimes associated with certain religious practices, slavery for primarily non-sexual purposes but where non-consensual [[sex]] is common, or [[forced prostitution]].

===Sex-selective abortion===
{{Main|Sex-selective abortion}}
Sex-selective abortion is the practice of terminating a pregnancy based upon the predicted gender of the baby.  The selective [[abortion]] of female fetuses is most common in areas where cultural norms value male children over female children,&lt;ref name= "Goodkind"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goodkind, Daniel |year=1999 |title=Should Prenatal Sex Selection be Restricted?: Ethical Questions and Their Implications for Research and Policy |journal=Population Studies |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=49–61 |jstor=2584811 |doi=10.1080/00324720308069}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in parts of [[People's Republic of China]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Korea]], [[Taiwan]], and the [[Caucasus]].&lt;ref name= "Goodkind"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Gettis"&gt;A. Gettis, J. Getis, and J. D. Fellmann (2004). Introduction to Geography, Ninth Edition. New York: McGraw-Hill. pp. 200. ISBN 0-07-252183-X&lt;/ref&gt; The reason being is that males are viewed as a way for a family to make money by working in the future, while a female is not. A 2011 report in Science Daily states that this trend has continued to grow steadily the last ten years and will likely cause problems in the future when there are a shortage of women to marry and reproduce with.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Medical Association Journal (2011, March 14). The impact of sex selection and abortion in China, India and South Korea. ScienceDaily. Retrieved March 26, 2012, from http://www.sciencedaily.com /releases/2011/03/110314132244.ht&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transphobia===
{{Main|Transphobia}}
Transphobia refers to prejudice against transsexuality and transsexual or transgender people, based on their personal gender identification (see [[Phobia#Terms_for_prejudice_or_discrimination|Phobia - terms for prejudice or discrimination]]). Whether intentional or not, transphobia can have severe consequences for the person the object of the negative attitude. The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ([[LGBT]]) movement has campaigned against sexism against transsexuals. One form of sexism against transsexuals is how many "women-only" and "men-only" events and organizations have been criticized for rejecting trans women and trans men, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;"Michigan Women's Music Festival ends policy of discrimination against Transwomen" http://www.intraa.org/story/newmwmfpolicy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lesfest. http://www.lesbian.com/news/international_2003_1006.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antisexism movements==
{{main|Women's rights}}
In [[Ecuador]], the Pink Helmets (or Cascos Rosas), created in May 2011, by Freddy Caleron and Damian Valencia, both 18, sought to unite young men against machismo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saynotoviolence.org/join-say-no/ecuador-pink-helmets-say-no-violence-against-women Saynotoviolence.com].&lt;/ref&gt; The Pink Helmets published a manual suggesting 30 actions aimed at putting an end to violence in society, in relationships, within families, and among friends. The Pink Helmets' creators and participating members, who call themselves "neomasculinos" and are 15–20 years old, visit schools and streets to give talks and take part in festivals, such as the [[Quito Fest]], in collaboration with [[UN Women]] (part of the United Nations), to raise awareness on violence and on the movement against it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwomen.org/2011/11/espanol-los-jovenes-lideran-la-lucha-por-la-igualdad-y-contra-la-violencia-de-genero-en-ecuador/ UN Women].&lt;/ref&gt; Chauvinism and violence are common in Ecuador, with 40% of children under age 15 saying that they have witnessed acts of violence at home.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} According to the ''National Plan for the Eradication of Gender Violence of the Government of Ecuador'', 80% of women have been victims of violence at least once and 21% of children and adolescents have been sexually abused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/america/2011/10/02/noticias/1317569157.html "Unos jóvenes combaten el machismo en Ecuador con cascos rosas"], ''El Mundo''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, no official data provide a concrete number of women who have been killed or injured by men. The overall movement aims to promote gender equality, eliminate gender violence against women, and encourage "dialogue of respect between men and women from adolescence without hesitation to criticize sexist concepts that live in their culture".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larepublica.pe/02-10-2011/ecuador-jovenes-combaten-el-machismo-con-cascos-rosas LaRepublica].&lt;/ref&gt;
