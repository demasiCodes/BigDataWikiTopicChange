'''Sexism''' or '''gender discrimination''' is prejudice or discrimination based on a person's sex or gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sexism|title=Sexism - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=August 31, 2012 |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexist attitudes may stem from traditional [[stereotype]]s of [[gender role]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Matsumoto, 2001.

== Origin of the term ==
According to [[Fred R. Shapiro]], in ''American Speech'' (Vol. 60, No. 1, Spring 1985), the term "sexism" was most likely coined on November 18, 1965, by [[Pauline M. Leet]] during the Student-Faculty Forum at [[Franklin and Marshall College]].&lt;ref name="wordpress2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2007/10/19/feminism-friday-the-origins-of-the-word-sexism/ |title=Feminism Friday: The origins of the word "sexism" |work=Finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com |date=October 19, 2007 |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term appears in Leet's forum contribution titled "Women and the Undergraduate", in which she defines it by comparing it to racism, saying in part, "When you argue…that since fewer women write good poetry this justifies their total exclusion, you are taking a position analogous to that of the racist — I might call you in this case a "sexist"… Both the racist and the sexist are acting as if all that has happened had never happened, and both of them are making decisions and coming to conclusions about someone’s value by referring to factors which are in both cases irrelevant."&lt;ref name="wordpress2007"/&gt;

Also according to Shapiro, the first time the term "sexism" appeared in print was in Caroline Bird's speech "On Being Born Female", which was published on November 15, 1968, in ''Vital Speeches of the Day'' (p.&amp;nbsp;6).&lt;ref name="wordpress2007"/&gt; In this speech she said in part, "There is recognition abroad that we are in many ways a sexist country. Sexism is judging people by their sex when sex doesn’t matter. Sexism is intended to rhyme with racism. Both have been used to keep the powers that be in power."&lt;ref name="wordpress2007"/&gt;

[[Sheldon Vanauken]] is sometimes falsely claimed to have coined the term "sexism" in his pamphlet "Freedom for Movement Girls – Now".&lt;ref name="wordpress2007"/&gt; In the pamphlet the term "sexism" appears without any citation of Leet or Bird, thus leading to the false idea that Vanauken coined it himself.&lt;ref name="wordpress2007"/&gt;

[[File:A Hindoo Widow Burning Herself with the Corpse of her Husband.jpg|thumb|240px|[[sati (practice)|Sati]], or self-immolation by widows was prevalent in [[Hindu]] society during the Middle Ages.]]
Certain forms of sex discrimination are illegal in some countries; in others, discrimination may be legally sanctioned under a variety of circumstances.&lt;ref name="Neuwirth"&gt;Neuwirth, Jessica (2004). [http://www.msmagazine.com/summer2004/globalwomenlaw.asp "Unequal: A Global Perspective on Women Under the Law"]. ''Ms. Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Ancient sexism}} Ancient world ===
According to [[Peter Stearns]], women in pre-agricultural societies held equal positions with men; it was only after the adoption of agriculture and sedentary cultures that men began to institutionalize the concept that women were inferior to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= A Brief History of the World Course No. 8080 [Audio CD]|author= Peter N. Stearns (Narrator)|publisher= The Teaching Company|asin=B000W595CC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Definitive examples of sexism in the ancient world included written laws preventing women from participating in the political process; for example, Roman women could not vote or hold [[Roman magistrate|political office]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce W. Frier and Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'' (Oxford University Press: American Philological Association, 2004), pp. 31–32, 457, ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Witch hunts and trials===
[[Image:Malleus.jpg|thumb|Title page of the seventh [[Cologne]] edition of the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'', 1520 (from the [[University of Sydney Library]]). The Latin title is "''MALLEUS MALEFICARUM, Maleficas, &amp; earum hæresim, ut phramea potentissima conterens.''" (Generally translated into English as ''The Hammer of Witches which destroyeth Witches and their heresy as with a two-edged sword'').&lt;ref&gt;The English translation is from [http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/notes/n192863.html this note] to [http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/mm00c7.html Summers' 1928 introduction].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|Witch hunt}}
Throughout history, women accused of [[witchcraft]] have been targeted by religious and state authorities, subjected to [[violence]], prosecuted, and executed. The [[witch trials in the early modern period]] were a period of [[witch hunts]] between the 15th and 18th centuries,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 01.&lt;/ref&gt; when across [[early modern Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;largely excluding the Iberian Peninsula and Italy; "Inquisition Spain and Portugal, obsessed with heresy, ignored the witch craze. In Italy, witch trials were comparatively rare and did not involve torture and executions." Anne L. Barstow, ''Witchcraze : a New History of the European Witch Hunts'', HarperCollins, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;   and to some extent in the European colonies in North America, there were widespread claims that malevolent [[Satanism|Satanic]] [[witchcraft|witches]] were operating as an organized threat to [[Christendom]]. Several authors argue that the widespread [[misogyny]] of that period played a role in the persecution of these women.&lt;ref&gt;Barstow, Anne Llewellyn (1994) ''Witchcraze: A New History of the European Witch Hunts'' San Francisco: Pandora.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. pp. 42-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Malleus Malificarum]]'', the book which played a major role in the witch hunts and trials, the authors argue that women are more likely to practice witchcraft than men, and write that:
:All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman&amp;nbsp;... What else is woman but a foe to friendship, an inescapable punishment, a necessary evil, a natural temptation, a desirable calamity, a domestic danger, a delectable detriment, an evil of nature, painted with fair colours!&lt;ref&gt;Kramer and Sprenger. Malleus Malificarum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, practicing witchcraft remains illegal in several countries, including [[Saudi Arabia]], where it is [[punishable by death]]; and in 2011 a woman was beheaded in that country for 'witchcraft and sorcery'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/13/world/meast/saudi-arabia-beheading/ | work=CNN | title=Saudi woman beheaded for 'witchcraft and sorcery' - CNN.com | date=December 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coverture and other marriage regulations ===
{{main|Coverture}}
Until the 20th century U.S. and [[English law]] observed the system of [[coverture]], where "by marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law; that is the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage".&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone, William. ''Commentaries on the Laws of England.''http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/xBlack.htm&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. women were not legally defined as "persons" until 1875 (''[[Minor v. Happersett]]'', 88 U.S. 162).&lt;ref name="legacy98.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy98.org/timeline.html |title=Legacy '98: Detailed Timeline |publisher=Legacy98.org |date=2001-09-19 |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[France]] married women received the right to work without their husband's permission in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/explore/cmcf-vsi-women-in-france.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parisvoice.com/-archives-97-86/282-frances-leading-women-show-the-way |title=France's leading women show the way |publisher=Parisvoice.com |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womeninworldhistory.com/TWR-07.html |title=Lesson - The French Civil Code (Napoleonic Code) - Teaching Womens Rights From Past to Present |publisher=Womeninworldhistory.com |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[West Germany]] women obtained this right in 1977 (women in [[East Germany]] enjoyed more rights).&lt;ref&gt;.http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/world/europe/06iht-letter.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.356386.de/dp998.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Spain]] during the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] era a married woman required her husband's consent (''permiso marital'') for nearly all economic activities, including employment, ownership of property and traveling away from home; the ''permiso marital'' was abolished in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/spain/43.htm |title=Spain - Social Values And Attitudes |publisher=Countrystudies.us |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, women still lose significant legal rights at [[marriage]]. For example, [[Yemen]]i marriage regulations state that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/Yemen%27s%20darkside-discrimination_Yemen_HRC101.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Iraq]] husbands have a legal right to "punish" their wives. The criminal code states at Paragraph 41 that there is no crime if an act is committed while exercising a legal right; examples of legal rights include: "The punishment of a wife by her husband, the disciplining by parents and teachers of children under their authority within certain limits prescribed by law or by custom".&lt;ref&gt;http://law.case.edu/saddamtrial/documents/Iraqi_Penal_Code_1969.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] the Family Code states that the husband is the head of the household; the wife owes her obedience to her husband; a wife has to live with her husband wherever he chooses to live; and wives must have their husbands' authorization to bring a case in court or to initiate other legal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/drc/Congo0602-09.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender stereotypes ==

[[File:Bettie Page driving.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Series of photographs lampooning women drivers|1952 portrayal of stereotypes about women drivers]]
Gender stereotypes are widely held beliefs about the characteristics and behavior of women and men.&lt;ref&gt;Manstead, A. S. R.; Hewstone, Miles; et al. ''The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Social Psychology''. Oxford, UK; Cambridge, Mass., USA: Blackwell, 1999, 1995, pp. 256 &amp;ndash; 57, ISBN 978-0-631-22774-8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empirical]] studies have found widely shared cultural beliefs that men are more socially valued and more competent than women in a number of activities.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, David G. and Joseph Berger (1997). ''Gender and Interpersonal Task Behaviors: Status Expectation Accounts.'' Sociological Perspectives, Vol. 40, No. 1, pp. 1-32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, John E. and Deborah L. Best. ''Measuring Sex Stereotypes: A Multinational Study.'' Newbury Park, CA: Sage, 1990, ISBN 978-0-8039-3815-1.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Susan Fiske]] and her colleagues surveyed nine diverse samples from different regions of the United States. Fiske found that members of these samples, regardless of age, consistently rated the category of "men" higher than the category of "women" on a multidimensional scale of competence.&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, Susan T., Amy J. C. Cuddy, Peter Glick, Jun Xu (2002). [http://www.nd.edu/~wcarbona/Fiske-et-al-2002.pdf ''A Model of (Often Mixed) Stereotype Content: Competence and Warmth Respectively Follow From Perceived Status and Competition.''] Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol. 82, No. 6, p. 892.&lt;/ref&gt; Dustin B. Thoman and others (2008) hypothesize that “The socio-cultural salience of ability versus other components of the gender-math stereotype may impact women pursuing math”. Through the experiment comparing the math outcomes of women under two various gender-math stereotype components, which are the ability of math and the effort on math respectively, Thoman and others found that women’s math performance is more likely to be affected by the negative ability stereotype, which is influenced by socio-cultural beliefs in the United States, rather than the effort component.  As a result of this experiment and the socio-cultural beliefs in the United States, Thoman and others concluded that individuals’ academic outcomes can be affected by the gender-math stereotype component that is influenced by the socio-cultural beliefs (Thoman et al. 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Thoman, Dustin B., Paul H. White, Niwako Yamawaki, and Hirofumi Koishi. "Variations of Gender–math Stereotype Content Affect Women’s Vulnerability to Stereotype Threat." Sex Roles 58.9-10 (2008): 702-12. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are huge areal differences in attitudes towards appropriate gender roles. For example, in the ''[[World Values Survey]]'', responders were asked if they thought that wage work should be restricted to only men in the case of shortage in jobs. While in [[Iceland]] the proportion that agreed was 3.6%, in [[Egypt]] it was 94.9%.&lt;ref&gt;Fortin, Nicole, "Gender Role Attitudes and the Labour Market Outcomes of Women Across OECD Countries", Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 2005, 21, 416–438.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people believe a phenomenon known as [[stereotype threat]] can lower women's performance on mathematics tests, creating a self-fulfilling stereotype of women having inferior quantitative skills compared to men.&lt;ref&gt;Shih, Margaret, Todd L. Pittinsky and Nalini Ambady (1999). [https://www.amherst.edu/media/view/120864/original/Shin%2Bet%2Bal--stereotype%2Bsusceptibility.pdf ''Stereotype Susceptibility: Identity, Salience and Shifts in Quantitative Performance.''] Psychological Science, Vol. 10, No. 1, pp. 80-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Claude M.

These "biased self-assessments" have far-reaching effects, because they can shape men and women’s educational and career decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Correll, Shelley J. (2001).

=== American gender stereotypes ===
Gender roles are behaviors and tasks which society associates with each gender. In the United States, men are typically expected to be stoic, decisive, direct, athletic, strong, driven, and brave; women are expected to be emotional, nurturing, affectionate, home-oriented and forgiving.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Rachael SeemM, D. C. (2006). Healthy women, healthy men, and healthy adults: An evaluation of gender role stereotypes in the twenty-first century. Sex Roles, 55(3-4), 247-258. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11199-006-9077-0&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[OECD]], women's labor-market behavior "is influenced by learned cultural and social values that may be thought to discriminate against women (and sometimes against men) by stereotyping certain work and life styles as 'male' or 'female'". The organization contends that women's educational choices "may be dictated, at least in part, by their expectations that [certain] types of employment opportunities are not available to them, as well as by gender stereotypes that are prevalent in society".&lt;ref name="oecd.org" /&gt;

Professional discrimination against women in the workplace continues. One study found that 50 percent of women in government jobs reported that they had experienced discrimination while performing a work-related task, and 20 percent of female government employees reported that they experienced gender discrimination at work.&lt;ref&gt;Lawn-Day, G.A. and Ballard, S.  “Speaking out: Perceptions of women managers in public service.”  Review of Public Personnel Administration, Vol. 16 No. 1,1996, pp. 41-58&lt;/ref&gt; Women do not receive [[Equal Pay Act of 1963|equal pay]] for equal work, and are less likely to be promoted.&lt;ref&gt;Ashraf, J.  “Is Gender Pay Discrimination on the Wane?  Evidence from Panel Data, 1968-1989”, Industrial and Labor Relations Review, Vol. 49 No.3, 1996, p.539&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1833, women working in factories earned one-quarter of what men earned; in 2007, women's median annual paychecks were $0.78 for every $1.00 earned by men. A study showed that women comprised 87% of workers in the child-care industry, and 86 percent of the health-aide industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.now.org/issues/economic/factsheet.html |title=Women Deserve Equal Pay |publisher=Now.org |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others contest the wage gap, saying the difference in pay primarily reflects different career and work-hours choices by men and women rather than sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-28246928/the-gender-pay-gap-is-a-complete-myth/ |title=The Gender Pay Gap is a Complete Myth |publisher=CBS News |date=March 8, 2011 |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 study found that being overweight harms women's career advancement, but presents no barrier for men. [[Overweight]] or [[obese]] women were significantly underrepresented among company bosses; however, a significant proportion{{quantify|date=October 2013}} of male executives were overweight or obese. The author of the study stated that the results suggest that "the '[[glass ceiling]] effect' on women's advancement may reflect not only general negative stereotypes about the competencies of women, but also weight bias that results in the application of stricter appearance standards to women. Overweight women are evaluated more negatively than overweight men. There is a tendency to hold women to harsher weight standards."&lt;ref&gt;Roehling, Patricia V., Mark V. Roehling, Jeffrey D. Vandlen, Justin Blazek, William C. Guy (2009). ''Weight discrimination and the glass ceiling effect among top US CEOs.'' Equal Opportunity International, Vol. 28, Iss. 2, pp.179 - 196, {{doi|10.1108/02610150910937916}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moult, Julie.

Transgender people also experience workplace discrimination and harassment.&lt;ref&gt;Badgett, M.L., Lau, H., Sears, B., &amp; Ho, D. (2007) ''Bias in the Workplace: Consistent Evidence of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Discrimination.'' Los Angeles: The Williams Institute. http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/research/workplace/bias-in-the-workplace-consistent-evidence-of-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-discrimination/&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike sex-based discrimination, the refusal to hire (or firing) a worker for their gender identity or expression is legal in most countries and U.S. states.

Gender discrimination is closely related to the patriarchy.  The stereotypes, to some extent, are formed because of the patriarchy.  Patriarchy is a social system in which males are the primary authority figures central to social organization, occupying roles of political leadership, moral authority, and control of property, and where fathers hold authority over women and children. It implies the institutions of male rule and privilege, and entails female subordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malti-Douglas|first=Fedwa|title=Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender|date=2007|publisher=Macmillan|location=Detroit|isbn=0-02-865960-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In language ==
Sexism in language exists when language helps to devalue members of a certain sex and thus fosters gender inequality, reinforcing ideas of gender-based dominance.&lt;ref name="online.santarosa.edu"&gt;Santa Rosa Junior College. “Uses and Abuses of Language.” http://online.santarosa.edu/presentation/page/?37061&lt;/ref&gt;  What is now termed [[sexist]] language often promotes the idea of inherently male superiority, resulting in discrimination against women.&lt;ref&gt;Linguarama. “Sexism in Language.” http://www.linguarama.com/ps/legal-themed-english/sexism-in-language.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexism in language has arisen as a topic of concern as academics have pointed to the role that language plays in articulating consciousness, ordering our reality, encoding and transmitting cultural meanings and affecting socialization.&lt;ref name="online.santarosa.edu"/&gt; Researchers have pointed to the semantic rule in operation in language of the male-as-norm.&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;Spender, Dale. “Man Made Language.” http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/spender.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This results in sexism as the male becomes the standard and those who are not male are relegated to the inferior.&lt;ref name="marxists.org"/&gt; Examples include the use of generic masculine words which refer to all humanity, like man, master, father, and brother. Other examples include the use of the singular masculine pronoun (he, his, him). Further examples point to terms ending in 'man' that may be performed by individuals of either sex, such as businessman, chairman, policeman. Finally, ordering of words also relegates women to an inferior position, in examples like "man and wife". Sexism in language is considered a form of indirect sexism, in that it is not always overt.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Sara. “Language and Sexism.” http://www.langtoninfo.com/web_content/9780521001748_frontmatter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Words and expressions that can be used to refer to men or women may be strongly associated with men or women (i.e., be associated with a gender stereotype, such as doctor or nurse, respectively) or be gender neutral.&lt;ref name="Kennison &amp; Trofe 2002"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Kennison| first1=S. |last2=Trofe |first2=J. |title=Comprehending Pronouns: A Role for

=== Sexist and gender-neutral language ===
{{See also|Gender-neutral language}}
Various feminist movements in the 20th century, from [[liberal feminism]] and [[radical feminism]] to [[standpoint feminism]], [[postmodern feminism]] and [[queer theory]] have all considered language in their theorizing.&lt;ref&gt;Mille, Katherine Wyly and Paul McIlvenny. “Gender and Spoken Interaction: A Survey of Feminist Theories and Sociolinguistic Research in the United States and Britain.” http://paul-server.hum.aau.dk/research/cv/Pubs/mille-mcilvenny.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these theories have maintained a critical stance on language that call on a change in the way speakers use their language.
One of the most common calls is for [[gender-neutral language]]. Many have called attention, however, to the fact that the English language isn't inherently sexist in its linguistic system, but rather the way it is used becomes sexist and [[gender-neutral language]] could thus be employed.&lt;ref&gt;Ruthven, K.K. “Feminist literary studies: an introduction.” http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam034/90034404.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, other oppose critiques of sexism in language with explanations that language is a descriptive, rather than prescriptive, and attempts to control it can be fruitless.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.friesian.com/language.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexism in languages other than English===
Languages other than English are also charged with sexism in language.

[[Romanic languages]] such as [[French language|French]]&lt;ref&gt;Sayare, Scott.  “’Mademoiselle’ Exits Official France.” http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/23/world/europe/france-drops-mademoiselle-from-official-use.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]&lt;ref&gt;BBC. "Mexico advises workers on sexist language." http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-12843948&lt;/ref&gt; have been accused of sexist structures, in that the masculine form is the default form. For example, due to pressure from several feminist groups, the word 'mademoiselle', meaning [[miss]] was declared banished from the French language in 2012 by Prime Minister [[François Fillon]].&lt;ref&gt;Sayare, Scott.  “’Mademoiselle’ Exits Official France.” http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/23/world/europe/france-drops-mademoiselle-from-official-use.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; Current pressure calls for the use of the masculine plural pronoun as the default in a mixed-sex group to change.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Culley Jane. “Attacking a Legacy of Sexist Grammar in the French Class: A Modest Beginning.” http://www.jstor.org/stable/40545648&lt;/ref&gt; As to Spanish, Mexico's Ministry of the Interior published a guide on how to reduce the use of sexist language.&lt;ref&gt;BBC. "Mexico advises workers on sexist language." http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-12843948&lt;/ref&gt;

[[German language|German]] speakers have also raised questions about how sexism intersects with grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters. "Grappling with language sexism." http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate-uk/2011/03/05/grappling-with-language-sexism/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], some writers have pointed to sexism inherent in the structure of written characters. For example, the character for man is linked to those for positive qualities like courage and effect while the character for wife is composed of a female part and a broom, considered of low worth.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, Dali. “Sexism in the Chinese Language.” http://www.jstor.org/stable/4316075&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anthropological linguistics and gender-specific language ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
Unlike the [[Indo-European languages]], [[gender-specific pronouns]] in many other [[languages]] are a relatively recent phenomenon (occurring during the early 20th century). Cultural revolution resulted from [[colonialism]] in many parts of the world, with attempts to modernize and westernize local languages with gender-specific and animate-inanimate pronouns. As a result, [[gender-neutral pronoun]]s became gender-specific (see, for example, [[Gender-neutrality in languages without grammatical gender#Turkish|gender-neutrality in languages without grammatical gender: Turkish]]).

=== Gender-specific pejorative terms ===
Gender-specific pejorative terms intimidate or harm another person because of their gender. Sexism can be expressed in language with negative gender-oriented implications,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anti-bullyingalliance.org.uk/pdf/SST%20Quick%20Guide.pdf ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Disdain|condescension]]. Other examples include obscene language. &lt;!-- Do not list swear words here. --&gt;Some words are offensive to transgender people, including "tranny", "she-male", or "he-she". Intentional misgendering (assigning the wrong gender to someone) and the pronoun "it" are also considered pejorative.&lt;ref name="Mills College Report on Inclusion of Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming Students Best Practices, Assessment and Recommendations"&gt;Mills College Transgender Best Practices Taskforce &amp; Gender Identity and Expression Sub-Committee of the Diversity and Social Justice Committee.

== Occupational sexism ==
{{Main|Occupational sexism}}
Occupational sexism refers to [[discriminatory]] practices, statements or actions, based on a person's [[sex]], occurring in the workplace. One form of occupational sexism is [[wage discrimination]].

In 2008 the  [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) found that while female employment rates have expanded and gender employment and wage gaps have narrowed nearly everywhere, on average women still have 20% less chance to have a job and are paid 17% less than men.&lt;ref name="oecd1"/&gt; The report stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;[In] many countries, labour market [[discrimination]] – i.e. the unequal treatment of equally productive individuals only because they belong to a specific group – is still a crucial factor inflating disparities in employment and the quality of job opportunities [...] Evidence presented in this edition of the ''Employment Outlook'' suggests that about 8% of the variation in gender employment gaps and 30% of the variation in gender wage gaps across OECD countries can be explained by discriminatory practices in the labour market.&lt;ref name="oecd1"&gt;[[OECD]]. [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/8/19/40937574.pdf ''OECD Employment Outlook - 2008 Edition Summary in English''.] OECD, Paris, 2008, p. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oecd2"&gt;[[OECD]].

Chapter 3: The Price of Prejudice: Labour Market Discrimination on the Grounds of Gender and Ethnicity''.] OECD, Paris, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It also found that despite the fact that almost all OECD countries, including the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Tokenism===

Research shows that women who enter predominantly male work groups often “experience the negative consequences of tokenism: performance pressures, social isolation, and role encapsulation”.&lt;ref&gt;Janice D. Yoder (1991): Rethinking Tokenism: Looking beyond Numbers. Gender and Society, Vol. 5, No. 2 (Jun., 1991), pp. 178-192 Published by: Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; However, attributing these negative consequences to tokenism itself might camouflage their root cause: sexism, “and its manifestations in higher-status men’s attempts to preserve their advantage in the workplace”.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there has been no causal link proven between the number of women working in an organization/company and the improvement of their conditions of employment (even worse, having an increasing number of women in a work place without appropriately addressing the “sexist attitudes imbedded in male-dominated organizations, may exacerbate women’s occupational problems”).&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Zimmer (1988): Tokenism and Women in the Workplace: The Limits of Gender-Neutral Theory. Social Problems, Vol. 35, No. 1 (Feb., 1988), pp. 64-77.Published by: University of California Press on behalf of the Society for the Study of Social Problems.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wage gap ===
{{Main|Gender pay gap}}
[[File:EU 27 Gender Pay Gap.001.png|thumb|300px|alt=Bar graph showing the gender pay gap in European countries|Gender pay gap in average gross hourly earnings according to [[Eurostat]] 2008&lt;ref name="EC stats" /&gt;]]
Several studies have found that women earn a smaller average wage than men. Many economists and feminist scholars have argued that this is the result of systemic gender-based discrimination in the workplace. Others, however, maintain that the wage gap is a result of differences between the choices that men and women make in the workplace, such as more women than men choosing to be full-time parents or work fewer hours to be part-time parents.

[[Eurostat]] found a persistent, average gender pay gap of 17.5 percent in the 27 [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="EC stats"&gt;[[European Commission]]. [http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/gender-pay-gap/situation-europe/index_en.htm ''The situation in the EU''.] Retrieved on August 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[OECD]] found that female full-time employees earned 17 percent less than their male counterparts in OECD countries in 2009.&lt;ref name="oecd1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oecd2"/&gt;

In the United States, the female-to-male earnings ratio was 0.77 in 2009; female full-time, year-round (FTYR) workers earned 77 percent as much as male FTYR workers. Women's earnings relative to men's fell from 1960 to 1980 (60.7 percent to 60.2 percent), rose rapidly from 1980 to 1990 (60.2 to 71.6 percent), leveled off from 1990 to 2000 (71.6 to 73.7 percent) and rose from 2000 to 2009 (73.7 to 77.0 percent).&lt;ref name="census 2009"&gt;U.S. Census Bureau.

In Taiwan, for example, studies show how the bulk of gender wage discrepancies occur within-occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph E. Zveglich, Jr. and Yana van der Meulen Rodgers (2004): Occupational Segregation and the Gender Wage Gap in a Dynamic East Asian Economy. Southern Economic Journal, Vol. 70, No. 4 (Apr., 2004), pp. 850-875 Published by: Southern Economic Association.&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, research shows that the gender wage gap is distributed unevenly across income levels, and that it mainly occurs at the lower end of income distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J. Gerry, Byung-Yeon Kim and Carmen A. Li (2004): The Gender Wage Gap and Wage Arrears in Russia: Evidence from the RLMS. Journal of Population Economics, Vol. 17, No. 2 (Jun., 2004), pp. 267-288 Published by: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Interestingly though, the research also finds that “wage arrears and payment in-kind attenuated wage discrimination, particularly amongst the lowest paid workers, suggesting that Russian enterprise managers assigned lowest importance to equity considerations when allocating these forms of payment”.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gender pay gap has been attributed to differences in personal and workplace characteristics between women and men (such as education, hours worked and occupation), innate behavioral and biological differences between men and women and discrimination in the labor market (such as gender stereotypes and customer and employer bias). Women interrupt their careers to take on child-rearing responsibilities more frequently than men.&lt;ref&gt;The Open University: Learning Space.[http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ECON303-8.2.1.pdf “Economics Explains Discrimination in the Labour Market."] Accessed June 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In Korea, for example, it has been a long-established practice to lay-off female employers upon marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Gyeongjoon Yoo (2003): Women in the Workplace: Gender and Wage Differentials.

Wage discrimination is theorized as contradicting the economic concept of [[supply and demand]], which states that if a good or service (in this case, labor) is in demand and has value it will find its price in the market. If a worker offered equal value for less pay, supply and demand would indicate a greater demand for lower-paid workers. If a business hired lower-wage workers for the same work, it would lower its costs and enjoy a [[competitive advantage]]. According to supply and demand, if women offered equal value demand (and wages) should rise since they offer a better price (lower wages) for their service than men do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swifteconomics.com/2009/09/21/lies-damned-lies-and-statistics-the-wage-gap/ |title=Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics: The Wage Gap |publisher=Swift Economics |date=September 21, 2009 |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor|Proposed Explanations}} Possible causes for wage discrimination  ====
According to Denise Venable at the [[National Center for Policy Analysis]], the "wage gap" is not the result of discrimination but of differences in lifestyle choices. Venable's report found that women are less likely than men to sacrifice personal happiness for increases in income or to choose full-time work. She found that among adults working between one and thirty-five hours a week and part-time workers who have never been married, women earn more than men. Venable also found that among people aged 27 to 33 who have never had a child, women's earnings approach 98% of men's and "women who hold positions and have skills and experience similar to those of men face wage disparities of less than 10 percent, and many are within a couple of points".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba392 |title=The Wage Gap Myth |publisher=NCPA |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venable concluded that women and men with equal skills and opportunities in the same positions face little or no wage discrimination: "Claims of unequal pay almost always involve comparing apples and oranges".

There is considerable agreement that gender wage discrimination exists, however, when it comes to estimating its magnitude, significant discrepancies are visible. A meta-regression analysis concludes that "the estimated gender gap has been steadily declining" and that the wage rate calculation is proven to be crucial in estimating the wage gap.&lt;ref&gt;T.D.Stanley and Stephen B. Jarrell: Gender Wage Discrimination Bias? A Meta-Regression Analysis. The Journal of Human Resources, Vol XXXIII,4. P. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis further notes that excluding experience and failing to correct for selection bias from analysis might also bring to incorrect conclusions.

=== Glass ceiling effect ===
{{Main|Glass ceiling}}
“The popular notion of glass ceiling effects implies that gender (or other) disadvantages are stronger at the top of the hierarchy than at lower levels and that these disadvantages become worse later in a person's career.”&lt;ref&gt;David A. Cotter, Joan M. Hermsen, Seth Ovadia and Reeve Vanneman (2001): The Glass Ceiling Effect. Social Forces, Vol. 80, No. 2 (Dec., 2001), pp. 655-681 Published by: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, women account for 47 percent of the overall labor force, and yet they make up only 6 per-cent of corporate CEOs and top executives.&lt;ref name="David A 2011"&gt;David A. Matsa and Amalia R. Miller (2011): Chipping away at the Glass Ceiling: Gender Spillovers in Corporate Leadership. American Economic Review: Papers and Proceedings 2011, 101:3, 635–639.&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers see the root cause of this situation in the tacit discrimination based on gender, conducted by current top executives and corporate directors (primarily male), as well as “the historic absence of women in top positions”, which “may lead to hysteresis, preventing women from accessing powerful, male-dominated professional networks, or same-sex mentors”.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; The glass ceiling effect is noted as being especially persistent for women of colour (according to a report, “women of colour perceive a ‘concrete ceiling’ and not simply a glass ceiling).&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the economics profession, it has been observed (Singell et all, 1996) that women are more inclined than men to dedicate their time to teaching and service. Since continuous research work is crucial for promotion, “the cumulative effect of small, contemporaneous differences in research orientation could generate the observed significant gender difference in promotion”.&lt;ref&gt;John M. McDowell, Larry D. Singell, Jr., and James P. Ziliak (1999): Cracks in the Glass Ceiling: Gender and Promotion in the Economics Profession. The American Economic Review, Vol. 89, No. 2, Papers and Proceedings of the One Hundred Eleventh Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association (May 1999), pp. 392-396 Published by: American Economic Association.&lt;/ref&gt; In the high-tech industry, research shows that, regardless of the intra-firm changes, “extra-organizational pressures will likely contribute to continued gender stratification as firms upgrade, leading to the potential masculinization of skilled high-tech work”.&lt;ref&gt;Steven C. McKay (2006): Hard Drives and Glass Ceilings: Gender Stratification in High-Tech Production. Gender and Society, Vol. 20, No. 2, Apr 2006, pp 207 – 235. Published by Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] asserts that "progress in bringing women into leadership and decision making positions around the world remains far too slow."&lt;ref name="UN-IWD2006"&gt;{{cite web

===Potential remedies===

One research suggests that a possible remedy to the glass ceiling could be increasing the number of women on corporate boards, which could subsequently lead to increases in the number of women working in top management positions.&lt;ref name="David A 2011"/&gt; The same research suggests that this could also result in a “feedback cycle in which the presence of more female managers increases the qualified pool of potential female board members (for the companies they manage, as well as other companies), leading to greater female board membership and then further increases in female executives”.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectification ==
[[File:Menu.jpg|thumb|An example of [[sexual objectification]] of women on a wine menu{{OR|date=October 2013}}]]
Objectification is treating a person, usually a woman, as an object.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-objectification/&lt;/ref&gt; By being objectified, a person is denied agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goh-Mah|first=Joy|title=The Objectification of Women - It Goes Much Further Than Sexy Pictures|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/joy-goh-mah/objectification-women-sexy-pictures_b_3403251.html|publisher=Huffpost Lifestyle|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Sexual objectification]] is where a person is viewed primarily in terms of sexual appeal or as a source of sexual gratification. This is sometimes regarded as a form of sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Free Dictionary|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sex+object|publisher=Random House Kernerman Webster's College Dictionary|accessdate=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# instrumentality: treating the object as a tool for the objectifier’s purposes
# denial of autonomy: treating the object as lacking in autonomy and self-determination
# inertness: - treating the object as lacking in agency
# fungibility: - treating the object as interchangeable with other objects
# violability: - treating the object as lacking in boundaries-integrity
# ownership: - treating the object as something that is owned by another (can be bought or sold);
# denial of subjectivity: treating the object as something whose experiences and feelings (if any) need not be taken into account.

According to objectification theory (Fredrickson &amp; Robert, 1997)  objectification can have important repercussions on women, particularly young women, as it can lead to mental disorders (depression, eating disorders, etc.).&lt;ref name="FredricksonRoberts1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fredrickson|first1=Barbara L.|last2=Roberts|first2=Tomi-Ann|title=OBJECTIFICATION THEORY.|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume=21|issue=2|year=1997|pages=173–206|issn=0361-6843|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00108.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectification can take place in a variety of areas, such as in advertising and pornography.

===In advertising===
While advertising used to portray women in obvious stereotypical ways (e.g. as a housewife), women in today’s advertisements are no longer solely confined to the house.  However, advertising today nonetheless still stereotypes women, albeit in more subtle ways, including by sexually objectifying them.&lt;ref name="Lindner2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lindner|first1=Katharina|title=Images of Women in General Interest and Fashion Magazine Advertisements from 1955 to 2002|journal=Sex Roles|volume=51|issue=7/8|year=2004|pages=409–421|issn=0360-0025|doi=10.1023/B:SERS.0000049230.86869.4d}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is problematic because there appears to be a relationship between the manner in which women are portrayed in advertising and people’s ideas about the role of women in society.&lt;ref name="Lindner2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lindner|first1=Katharina|title=Images of Women in General Interest and Fashion Magazine Advertisements from 1955 to 2002|journal=Sex Roles|volume=51|issue=7/8|year=2004|pages=409–421|issn=0360-0025|doi=10.1023/B:SERS.0000049230.86869.4d}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Research has shown that gender role stereotyping  in advertising is linked to negative attitudes towards women, as well as more acceptance of sexual aggression against women and rape myth acceptance.&lt;ref name="Lindner2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lindner|first1=Katharina|title=Images of Women in General Interest and Fashion Magazine Advertisements from 1955 to 2002|journal=Sex Roles|volume=51|issue=7/8|year=2004|pages=409–421|issn=0360-0025|doi=10.1023/B:SERS.0000049230.86869.4d}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, gender role sterereotyping in advertisements may be injurious to women, as it is linked to negative body image and the development of eating disorders.

Traditionally, in Western countries, advertising was regulated under "obscenity" laws. These dealt with nudity and "indecent" poses, not with objectification itself.

Today, some countries (for example [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]]) have laws against [[Sex in advertising|sexual objectification in advertising]].&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7365722.stm | work=BBC News | title=Scandinavian split on sexist ads | date=2008-04-25 | accessdate=2010-04-06 | first=Stephanie | last=Holmes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nudity is not banned, and nude people can be used to advertise a product if they are relevant to the product advertised. Sol Olving, head of Norway's Kreativt Forum (an association of the country's top advertising agencies) explained, "You could have a naked person advertising shower gel or a cream, but not a woman in a bikini draped across a car".&lt;ref name="Holmes"/&gt;

Other countries continue to ban nudity (on traditional obscenity grounds), but also make explicit reference to sexual objectification, such as [[Israel]]'s ban of [[bilboard]]s that "depicts sexual humiliation or abasement, or presents a
human being as an object available for sexual use". (Art 214)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/investment/anti-bribery/anti-briberyconvention/43289694.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pornography ===
{{See also|Feminist views on pornography}}
Anti-pornography feminist [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argues that [[pornography]] contributes to sexism by objectifying women and portraying them in submissive roles.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, Catharine (1987). ''Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; MacKinnon, along with Andrea Dworkin, argues that pornography reduces women to mere tools, and is a form of sex discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Papadaki|first=Evangelia|title=Feminist Perspectives on Objectification|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/feminism-objectification/|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scholars highlight the link between objectification and pornography by stating:

"We define pornography as the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures and words that also includes (i) women are presented dehumanized as sexual objects, things, or commodities; or (ii) women are presented as sexual objects who enjoy humiliation or pain; or (iii) women are presented as sexual objects experiencing sexual pleasure in rape, incest or other sexual assault; or (iv) women are presented as sexual objects tied up, cut up or mutilated or bruised or physically hurt; or (v) women are presented in postures or positions of sexual submission, servility, or display; or (vi) women's body parts—including but not limited to vaginas, breasts, or buttocks — are exhibited such that women are reduced to those parts; or (vii) women are presented being penetrated by objects or animals; or (viii) women are presented in scenarios of degradation, humiliation, injury, torture, shown as filthy or inferior, bleeding, bruised, or hurt in a context that makes these conditions sexual."&lt;ref name="DworkinMacKinnon1988"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrea Dworkin|author2=Catharine A.

Some people opposed to pornography, including MacKinnon, charge that the production of pornography entails physical, psychological and economic [[coercion]] of the women who perform and model in it.&lt;ref name=stanford-shrage&gt;Shrage, Laurie. (2007-07-13). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-sex-markets/#Por "Feminist Perspectives on Sex Markets: Pornography"].

''Toward a Feminist Theory of the State'' Harvard University Press. ISBN 0-674-89645-9 (1st ed), ISBN 0-674-89646-7 (2nd ed). "Sex forced on real women so that it can be sold at a profit to be forced on other real women; women's bodies trussed and maimed and raped and made into things to be hurt and obtained and accessed, and this presented as the nature of women; the coercion that is visible and the coercion that has become invisible—this and more grounds the feminist concern with pornography"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{Cite episode| title = A Conversation With Catherine MacKinnon (transcript)| series = [[Think Tank (TV series)|Think Tank]]|network= PBS| accessdate = 2009-09-01| year = 1995| url = http://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript215.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of pornography charge that it presents a distorted image of sexual relations and reinforces sexual myths; it shows women as continually available and willing to engage in sex at any time, with any men, on their terms, responding positively to any requests. They write:

{{quote|Pornography affects people's belief in rape myths. So for example if a woman says "I didn't consent" and people have been viewing pornography, they believe rape myths and believe the woman did consent no matter what she said. That when she said no, she meant yes. When she said she didn't want to, that meant more beer. When she said she would prefer to go home, that means she's a lesbian who needs to be given a good corrective experience. Pornography promotes these rape myths and desensitises people to violence against women so that you need more violence to become sexually aroused if you're a pornography consumer. This is very well documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/apr/12/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Stuart | last=Jeffries | title=Stuart Jeffries talks to leading feminist Catharine MacKinnon | date=April 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Defenders of pornography and anti-censorship activists (including [[sex-positive feminists]]) argue that pornography does not seriously impact a mentally healthy individual, since the viewer can distinguish between pornography and reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael |last=Bader |url=http://www.alternet.org/story/104863/the_great_porn_misunderstanding%3A_pornography_is_mostly_about_fantasy,_not_reality |title=The Great Porn Misunderstanding: Pornography Is Mostly About Fantasy, Not Reality |publisher=Alternet |date=October 27, 2008 |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They contend that both sexes are objectified in pornography (particularly [[sadism and masochism (as medical terms)|sadistic or masochistic]] pornography, in which men are objectified and sexually used by women).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seejane.org/downloads/Hatton_Trautner_Sexuality_and_Culture.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prostitution===
[[File:Prostata Prostitute.jpg|thumb|Scene from [[Amsterdam]]'s [[De Wallen|red light district]]]]
Some people argue that [[prostitution]] is a form of exploitation of women, which is the result of discrimination of women (a lack of professional opportunities for women, poverty) and of patriarchal views on sexuality which stipulate that unwanted sex with a woman is acceptable, that men's desires must be satisfied at any cost, and that women exist to serve men sexually. They argue that the consent of the prostitute is seriously undermined by direct (pimps) or indirect (social circumstances) coercion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soc.iastate.edu/sapp/Prostitution.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J015v26n03_06#.UjsrJH9edO6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jan/18/ukcrime.prisonsandprobation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/10/endingatradeinmisery&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ressourcesfeministes.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/mackinnon-prostitution-and-civil-rights.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.ro/books?id=9mlFgjEBYWYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+industrial+vagina&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BVQ7UqTUN-Tl4gTIoYGADg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20industrial%20vagina&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Women's Lobby]] condemned prostitution as "an intolerable form of male violence".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.womenslobby.eu/spip.php?article472&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carole Pateman]] writes that:&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.ro/books?id=jH2KPvZF1L0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ro&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Prostitution is the use of a woman's body by a man for his own satisfaction. There is no desire or satisfaction on the part of the prostitute. Prostitution is not mutual, pleasurable exchange of the use of bodies, but the unilateral use of a woman's body by a man in exchange for money".

=== Media portrayals ===
Some feminist scholars believe that media portrayals of demographic groups can both maintain and disrupt attitudes and behaviors toward those groups.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, E., &amp; Henderson Daniel, J. (Eds.). (2005). ''Featuring females: Feminist analyses of media.'' Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. doi:10.1037/11213-000&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell, E., Malson, H., &amp; Tischner, I. (2011). Are contemporary media images which seem to display women as sexually empowering actually harmful to women? ''Psychology of Women Quarterly, 35'', 34-45. doi: 10.1177/0361684310385217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Entman, R., &amp; Rojecki, A. (2000). ''The Black image in the White mind: Media and race in America.'' Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2013}} These images are often harmful, particularly to women and racial and ethnic minority groups. For example, a study of African American women found they feel that media portrayals of African American women often reinforce stereotypes of this group as overly sexual and idealize images of lighter-skinned, thinner African American women (images African American women describe as objectifying).&lt;ref&gt;Watson, L. B., Robinson, D., Dispenza, F., &amp; Nazari, N. (2012). African American women's sexual objectification experiences: A qualitative study. ''Psychology of Women Quarterly, 36'', 227-239. doi: [http://pwq.sagepub.com/ 10.1177/0361684312454724]&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent analysis of images of Haitian women in the Associated Press photo archive from 1994 to 2009, several themes emerged emphasizing the "otherness" of Haitian women and characterizing them as victims in need of rescue.&lt;ref&gt;Rendon, M. J., &amp; Nicolas, G. (2012). Deconstructing the portrayals of Haitian women in the media: A thematic analysis of images in the Associated Press Photo Archive. ''Psychology of Women Quarterly, 36'', 227-239. doi: [http://pwq.sagepub.com/ 10.1177/0361684311429110]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexist jokes ===
Sexist jokes can be a form of sexual objectification, which reduces the subject of the joke to an object (e.g., "What do you do when your dishwasher won't work?" Answer: "You hit her"). They not only objectify women or men, but can also condone violence or prejudice against men or women.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} "Sexist humor—the denigration of women through humor—for instance, trivializes sex discrimination under the veil of benign amusement, thus precluding challenges or opposition that nonhumorous sexist communication would likely incur."&lt;ref name="ford"&gt;Ford, Thomas E., Christie F. Boxer, Jacob Armstrong, and Jessica R. Edel. 2007. More Than "Just a Joke": The Prejudice Releasing Function of Sexist Humor. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin. 34: 159-170.&lt;/ref&gt; A study of 73 male undergraduate students by Ford (2007) found that "sexist humor can promote the behavioral expression of prejudice against women amongst sexist men".&lt;ref name="ford" /&gt; According to the study, when sexism is presented in a humorous manner it is viewed as tolerable and socially acceptable. "Disparagement of women through humor 'freed' sexist participants from having to conform to the more general and more restrictive norms regarding discrimination against women."&lt;ref name="ford" /&gt; One example of sexist language is that used as slogans on the back of the [[Wicked Campers]] company such as "If you've ever met a woman with crooked teeth, you've met a woman who has given [[Chuck Norris]] a [[Fellatio|blow job]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/advertising-watchdog-upholds-complaints-against-wicked-campers-over-offensive-camper-van-slogans/story-e6frfq80-1226621001186 |title= Advertising watchdog upholds complaints against Wicked Campers over 'offensive' van slogans |work= [[news.com.au]] |date= April 15, 2013 |accessdate= 14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender discrimination ==
Gender discrimination is discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived gender identity. “Gender identity” is defined to mean “the gender-related identity, appearance, or mannerisms or other gender-related characteristics of an individual, with or without regard to the individual’s designated sex at birth”.&lt;ref name="fas.org"&gt;11. Feder, Jody and Cynthia Brougher. „Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Discrimination in Employment: A Legal Analysis of the Employment Non_Discrimination Act (ENDA).“ July 15, 2013. Available (online): www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40934.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Gender discrimination is theoretically different from sexism.&lt;ref&gt;5. Kimmel, Michael S. 2004. The Gendered Society. 2d ed. New York: Oxford Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas, sexism is prejudice based on biological sex, gender discrimination specifically addresses discrimination towards identity based orientations, including third gender, genderqueer, and other non-binary identified people.&lt;ref&gt;6. Macklem, Tony. 2004. Beyond Comparison: Sex and Discrimination. New York: Cambridge Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Banning discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression has emerged as a subject of contestation in the American legal system.&lt;ref name="hrc.org"&gt;9. “Employment Non-Discrimination Act”. Human Rights Campaign. Available (online): http://www.hrc.org/laws-and-legislation/federal-legislation/employment-non-discrimination-act&lt;/ref&gt; Legal interpretation of “sex” under Title VII of the United States’ Employment Non Discrimination Act (ENDA; H.R. 1755/S. 815) has, since the ruling of Price Waterhouse, encompassed both gender and sex. Since first introduced in Congress since 1993 at the 103rd Congress, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), has taken different stances on the inclusion of gender discrimination under the term “sex”.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt; More recently, the stated purpose of the legislation is “to address the history and persistent, widespread pattern of discrimination, including unconstitutional discrimination, on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity by private sector employers and local, State, and Federal Government employers,” as well as to provide effective remedies for such discrimination. However, under current law Title VII does not expressly prohibit discrimination based on gender identity or transsexualism.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt; The myriad forms of discrimination associated with gender non-conformity are therefore not expressly addressed nor protected under the ENDA. According to a recent report by the Congressional Research Service, “although the majority of federal courts to consider the issue have concluded that discrimination on the basis of gender identity is not sex discrimination, there have been several courts that have reached the opposite conclusion in the years since the Supreme Court's decision in Price Waterhouse”.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt; Hurst states, “Courts often confuse sex, gender and sexual orientation, and confuse them in a way that results in denying the rights not only of gays and lesbians, but also of those who do not present themselves or act in a manner traditionally expected of their sex”.&lt;ref&gt;1. Hurst, C. Social Inequality: Forms, Causes, and Consequences. Sixth Edition. 2007. 131, 139–142&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have suggested amending the EDNA to include these gender orientations. However, counter arguments question whether Title VII is general enough to include sexual orientation or gender identity discrimination in legal claims.&lt;ref name="hrc.org"/&gt; Gender discrimination is therefore, a gender identity based discrimination, whose codification into American and other legal systems has remained contested.

===Transgender discrimination===
Transgender discrimination is discrimination towards peoples whose gender identity differs from the social expectations of the biological sex they were born with.&lt;ref&gt;10. “Transgender.” UC Berkekely Online. Available (online): http://geneq.berkeley.edu/lgbt_resources_definiton_of_terms#transgender&lt;/ref&gt; Forms of discrimination include but are not limited to identity documents not reflecting one’s gender, sex-segregated public restrooms and other facilities, dress codes according to binary gender codes, and lack of access to and existence of appropriate health care services.&lt;ref name="verdict.justia.com"&gt;8. “The EEOC Rules that Transgender Discrimination Is Sex Discrimination.” Justia.com: Available (online): http://verdict.justia.com/2012/05/01/the-eeoc-rules-that-transgender-discrimination-is-sex-discrimination#sthash.OzR6wVcG.dpuf&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent adjudication, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) concluded that discrimination against a transgendered individual is sex discrimination.&lt;ref name="verdict.justia.com"/&gt; The National Transgender Discrimination Survey, the most extensive survey of transgender discrimination, in collaboration with the National Black Justice Coalition recently showed that Black transgender people in the United States suffer “the combination of anti-transgender bias and persistent, structural and individual racism” and that “black transgender people live in extreme poverty that is more than twice the rate for transgender people of all races (15%), four times the general Black population rate 9% and over eight times the general US population rate (4%)”.&lt;ref&gt;12. „The National Transgender Discrimination Survey Report“. National Center for Transgender Equality. Available (online): http://endtransdiscrimination.org/report.html&lt;/ref&gt; In another study conducted in collaboration with the League of United Latin American Citizens, Latino/a transgender people who were non-citizens were most vulnerable to harassment, abuse and violence.&lt;ref&gt;"The National Transgender Discrimination Survey Report“. National Center for Transgender Equality. Available (online): http://endtransdiscrimination.org/report.html&lt;/ref&gt; Peoples of color subjected to transgender discrimination suffer intersecting structural and individual levels of discrimination.

===Gender discrimination in politics===
[[File:Suffragette arrest, London, 1914.jpg|thumb|170px|A [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|suffragette]] arrested in the street by two police officers in [[London]] in 1914]]
Gender has been used, at times, as a tool of discrimination against women in the political sphere. Indeed, [[Women's suffrage]] was not achieved until 1893, when New Zealand was the first country to grant women the right to vote. Saudi Arabia was the last country to grant women the right to vote in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline of Women’s Suffrage Granted, by Country|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0931343.html|publisher=Infoplease|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Western countries allowed women the right to vote only relatively recently: [[Switzerland|Swiss]] women gained the right to vote in federal elections in 1971,&lt;ref name="switzerland-chronology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html |title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology |publisher=History-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] became the last [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] to grant women the right to vote on local issues (in 1991, when it was forced to do so by the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/WOM1373.doc.htm |title=United Nations press release of a meeting of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), issued on 14 January 2003 |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[France|French]] women were granted the right to vote in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Pierre Maury |url=http://mjp.univ-perp.fr/france/co1944-2.htm |title=Ordonnance du 21 avril 1944 relative à l'organisation des pouvoirs publics en France après la Libération |publisher=Mjp.univ-perp.fr |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/femmes/citoyennete_politique_de-Gaulle.asp |title=La citoyenneté politique des femmes&amp;nbsp;– La décision du Général de Gaulle |author=Assemblée nationale |accessdate=2007-12-19 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greece]], women obtained the right to vote in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.db-decision.de/CoRe/Greece.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

While almost every woman today has the right to vote, there is still progress to be made for women in politics. 
Indeed, studies have shown that in several democracies including Australia, Canada and the United States, women are still represented using deep-rooted gender stereotypes in the press &lt;ref name="KittilsonFridkin2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kittilson|first1=Miki Caul|last2=Fridkin|first2=Kim|title=Gender, Candidate Portrayals and Election Campaigns: A Comparative Perspective|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=4|issue=03|year=2008|issn=1743-923X|doi=10.1017/S1743923X08000330}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In fact, multiple authors have shown that gender differences in the media are less evident today than they used to be in the 1980s, but are nonetheless still present. Certain issues (e.g. education) are likely to be linked with female candidates, while other issues (e.g. taxes) are likely to be linked with male candidates.&lt;ref name="KittilsonFridkin2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kittilson|first1=Miki Caul|last2=Fridkin|first2=Kim|title=Gender, Candidate Portrayals and Election Campaigns: A Comparative Perspective|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=4|issue=03|year=2008|issn=1743-923X|doi=10.1017/S1743923X08000330}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, there is more emphasis on female candidates’ personal qualities, such as their appearance and their personality, as females are portrayed as “emotional” and “dependent”.&lt;ref name="KittilsonFridkin2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kittilson|first1=Miki Caul|last2=Fridkin|first2=Kim|title=Gender, Candidate Portrayals and Election Campaigns: A Comparative Perspective|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=4|issue=03|year=2008|issn=1743-923X|doi=10.1017/S1743923X08000330}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is problematic because voters’ views of the female and male candidates may be affected, as well as their views of women’s role in the political sphere &lt;ref name="KittilsonFridkin2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kittilson|first1=Miki Caul|last2=Fridkin|first2=Kim|title=Gender, Candidate Portrayals and Election Campaigns: A Comparative Perspective|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=4|issue=03|year=2008|issn=1743-923X|doi=10.1017/S1743923X08000330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender discrimination in politics can also be shown in the imbalance of law making power between men and women. Lanyan Chen asserts that men hold more political power than women, serving as the gatekeepers of policy making. It is possible that this leads to women's needs not being properly represented. In this sense, the inequality of law making power also causes the gender discrimination in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen|first=Lanyan|title=The Gendered Reality of Migrant Workers in Globalizing China|date=2009|publisher=The University of Ottawa|location=Ottawa|isbn=978-0-7766-0709-2|pages=186–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio of women to men in legislatures is used as a measure of gender equality in the [[United Nations|UN]] created [[Gender Inequality Index]].

== Examples ==
Sexism takes a number of forms, and is sometimes subtle or unconscious.

=== Child marriage ===
{{Main|Child marriage}}
{{Further|Dowry|Bride price}}

A child marriage is a [[marriage]] where one or both spouses are under 18.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"&gt;http://www.unicef.org/protection/57929_58008.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/06/14/q-child-marriage-and-violations-girls-rights&lt;/ref&gt; Girls are disproportionately the most affected.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt; Child marriages are most common in [[South Asia]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], but occur in other parts of the world, too. The practice of marrying young girls is rooted in patriarchal ideologies of control of female behavior, and is also sustained by traditional practices such as [[dowry]] and [[bride price]]. Child marriage is strongly connected with the protection of female [[virginity]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/people/features/ihavearightto/four_b/casestudy_art16.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; UNICEF states that:&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;
:"Marrying girls under 18 years old is rooted in [[gender discrimination]], encouraging premature and continuous child bearing and giving preference to boys' education. Child marriage is also a strategy for economic survival as families marry off their daughters at an early age to reduce their economic burden."

=== Controlling women's dressing attire ===

Laws that dictate how women must dress are seen by many international human rights organizations, such as [[Amnesty International]], as a form of gender discrimination.&lt;ref name="doc.es.amnesty.org"&gt;[https://doc.es.amnesty.org/cgi-bin/ai/BRSCGI/WOMENS%20RIGHT%20TO%20CHOOSE%20THEIR%20DRESS%20FREE%20OF%20COERCION?CMD=VEROBJ&amp;MLKOB=29309215959 Women’s right to choose their dress, free of coercion], Amnesty International, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International states that:&lt;ref name="doc.es.amnesty.org"/&gt;

:"Interpretations of religion, culture or tradition cannot justify imposing rules about dress on those who choose to dress differently. States should take measures to protect individuals from being coerced to dress in specific ways by family members, community or religious groups or leaders."

In many places, women who do not dress in socially and legally proscribed ways are often subjected to violence (for instance by the authorities, such as the [[religious police]], by family members, or by the community).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6900111.stm | work=BBC News | title=Iran to intensify dress crackdown | date=July 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/1874471.stm | work=BBC News | title=Saudi police 'stopped' fire rescue | date=March 15, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Globalize|discuss=Talk:Sexism#sexism in criminal justice|date=September 2013|section}}
Some studies in the United States have shown that for identical crimes, men are given harsher sentences than women. Controlling for arrest offense, criminal history and other pre-charge variables, sentences are over 60 percent heavier for men. Women are more likely to avoid charges entirely, and to avoid imprisonment if convicted.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/11/men-women-prison-sentence-length-gender-gap_n_1874742.html |title=Men Sentenced To Longer Prison Terms Than Women For Same Crimes, Study Says |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=July 20, 2013 |first=Simon |last=McCormack |date=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Michigan"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.law.umich.edu/newsandinfo/features/Pages/starr_gender_disparities.aspx|title=Study finds large gender disparities in federal criminal cases|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gender disparity varies according to the nature of the case (for example, there is a smaller gender gap in fraud cases than in drug trafficking and firearms). This disparity occurs in U.S. federal courts, despite guidelines designed to avoid differential sentencing.&lt;ref name="etd.ohiolink.edu"&gt;[http://etd.ohiolink.edu/view.cgi?acc_num=bgsu1237482038 ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many reasons postulated for the gender disparity. One of the most common is the larger caregiving role of women.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Michigan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="etd.ohiolink.edu"/&gt; Other possible reasons include the "girlfriend theory" (whereby women are seen as tools of their boyfriends),&lt;ref name="University of Michigan"/&gt; the theory that female defendants are more likely to cooperate with authorities,&lt;ref name="University of Michigan"/&gt; and that women are often successful at turning their violent crime into victimhood by citing defenses such as [[postpartum depression]] and [[battered wife syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearson|first=Patricia|title=When She Was Bad: How and Why Women Get Away With Murder|year=1998|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=0140243887|pages=236–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, none of these theories can account for the total disparity,&lt;ref name="University of Michigan"/&gt; and sexism has also been suggested as an underlying cause.&lt;ref&gt;"Unlike race and ethnic discrimination, however, the evidence is more consistent that part of this gap is due to different treatment of offenders based on their gender."{{cite web|url=http://www.ussc.gov/Research_and_Statistics/Research_Projects/Miscellaneous/15_Year_Study/chap4.pdf|title=Chapter Four: Racial, Ethnic, and Gender Disparities In Federal Sentencing Today|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminal justice system has also been accused of discriminating against women.[[Provocation (legal)|Provocation]] is, in many [[common law countries]], a partial defense to [[murder]], which converts what would have been murder into [[manslaughter]]. It is meant to be applied when a person kills in the 'heat of passion' upon being 'provoked' by the behavior of the victim. This defense has been criticized as being gendered, favoring men, due to it being used disproportionately in cases of [[adultery]], and other domestic disputes when women are killed by partners. As a result of the defense being considered as exhibiting a strong gender bias, and being a form of legitimization  of male violence against women and minimization of the harm caused by violence against women, it has been abolished or restricted in several jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Prod/parlment/publications.nsf/0/F2BA1BFEED2D87EECA257A4800001BD7/$File/briefing%20paper.provocation%20and%20self-defence.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://anj.sagepub.com/content/45/2/194.abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgender people are consistently discriminated against in jails and prisons. They are almost always put in the jail based on their sex and not their gender identity and are denied the ability to be able to take hormones or get sexual reassignment surgery and if they do they are never moved to prisons of the other gender. Studies show that trans people face an enormous amount of harassment and are at higher risk for sexual assault when they are not placed in prisons that match their gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;"Unlike race and ethnic discrimination, however, the evidence is more consistent that part of this gap is due to different treatment of offenders based on their gender."{{cite web|url=http://www.autostraddle.com/real-life-sophia-bursets-transgender-women-face-a-nightmare-in-mens-prisons-186876/|title=Real life Sophia Bursets Transgender Women face a nightmare in Men's Prisons|accessdate=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestic violence ===
{{Main|Domestic violence}}

[[File:Acid attack victim.jpg|thumb|250px|Acid attack victim in [[Cambodia]]]]
Domestic violence takes a number of forms (including verbal, physical and psychological abuse), which vary across the gender spectrum. Domestic violence is tolerated and even legally accepted in many parts of the world. For instance, in 2010, the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE)'s Supreme Court ruled that a man has the right to physically discipline his wife and children if he does not leave physical marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-10-19/world/uae.court.ruling_1_islamic-law-sharia-law-ruling?_s=PM:WORLD |title=Court in UAE says beating wife, child OK if no marks are left |publisher=CNN |accessdate=July 20, 2013 |date=October 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the 58th session of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] (2002) concerning cultural practices in the family that reflect violence against women (E/CN.4/2002/83):

{{quote|The Special Rapporteur indicated that there had been contradictory decisions with regard to the honour defense in [[Brazil]], and that legislative provisions allowing for partial or complete defense in that context could be found in the penal codes of [[Argentina]], [[Ecuador]], [[Egypt]], [[Guatemala]], [[Iran]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Peru]], [[Syria]], [[Venezuela]] and the [[Palestinian National Authority]].&lt;ref name="unhchr"&gt;''Working towards the elimination of crimes against women committed in the name of honour: Report of the Secretary-General''. 2 July 2002. United Nations General Assembly.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Honor killings]] are a form of domestic violence which continues to be practiced in several parts of the world. The victims of honor killings are usually women.&lt;ref name=Maris2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maris|first=Cees|author2=Sawitri Saharso |title=Honour Killing: A Case for Cultural Defense?|journal=Pluralism and Law: Proceedings of the 20th IVR World Congress, Amsterdam, 2001|year=2001|volume=3|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victims of honor killings are killed for reasons such as refusing to enter an arranged marriage, being in a relationship that is disapproved by their relatives, having sex outside marriage, becoming the victim of rape, dressing in ways which are deemed inappropriate, or engaging in homosexual relations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml#h3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/13/world/europe/turkey-gay-killing | work=CNN | title=Shocking gay honor killing inspires movie - CNN.com | date=January 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/02/23/arizona.iraqi.father/index.html | work=CNN | title=Iraqi immigrant convicted in Arizona 'honor killing' awaits sentence | date=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stoning]] (a form of punishment in which a group throws stones at a person, usually until the victimn dies) is associated with domestic disputes, especially those involving accusations of loss of chastity, adultery or the refusal of an arranged marriage.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Recently, several people have been sentenced to death by stoning after being accused of adultery in Iran, Somalia, Afghanistan, Sudan, Mali and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Akbar |first=Ali |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/25/iran-stoning-woman-adultery_n_1169429.html |title=Iran Stoning: Woman To Be Executed For Adultery |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=July 20, 2013 |date=December 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8366197.stm |title=Somali woman stoned for adultery |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-11-18 |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Robert Tait and Noushin Hoseiny |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jul/21/iran.humanrights |title=Eight women and a man face stoning in Iran for adultery |work= The Guardian |date= 2008-07-21|accessdate=2010-06-24 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,479752,00.html "Two Men Stoned to Death for Adultery in Iran".]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-10983494 | work=BBC News | title=Taliban 'kill adulterous Afghan couple' | date=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sommerville |first=Quentin |url=http://www.rawa.org/temp/runews/2011/01/27/woman-stoned-to-death-in-north-afghanistan.html |title=Woman stoned to death in north Afghanistan |publisher=Rawa.org |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/31/sudanese-woman-stoning-death-adultery | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=David | last=Smith | title=Sudanese woman sentenced to stoning death over adultery claims | date=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/02/world/africa/mali-couple-stoned/index.html |title=Islamists: Two stoned to death for committing adultery in Mali |publisher=CNN |accessdate=July 20, 2013 |date=August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author== |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/18/couple-sentenced-pakistan |title=Pakistani couple face death by stoning threat after conviction for adultery |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=July 20, 2013 |location=London |date=July 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practices such as [[honor killing]]s and stoning continue to be supported by mainstream politicians and other officials in some countries. In [[Pakistan]], after the 2008 [[Balochistan honour killings]] in which five women were killed by tribesmen of the [[Umrani|Umrani Tribe]] of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], Pakistani Federal Minister for Postal Services [[Israr Ullah Zehri]] defended the practice:&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4678530.ece |title=Three teenagers buried alive in 'honour killings' |accessdate=2008-09-05 |work=Times Online | location=London | first=Zahid | last=Hussain | date=2008-09-05}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; "These are centuries-old traditions, and I will continue to defend them.

[[Dowry deaths]] are deaths of women or girls who are murdered or driven to [[suicide]] by continuous harassment and violence by husbands and in-laws in an effort to extort an increased [[dowry]]. Dowry deaths are most common in countries such as India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. According to Amnesty International, "the ongoing reality of dowry-related violence is an example of what can happen when women are treated as property".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/women-s-rights/violence-against-women/violence-against-women-information&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===

The third  [[Millennium Development Goal]] is directed at achieving [[gender equality]] and women’s empowerment around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/gender.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
Improvement of equal educational opportunity contributes to the women’s empowerment&lt;ref&gt;Salome Francis, 1991, "Empower the Women! Empower the Nation", Sexual Politics, pp. 33-35&lt;/ref&gt; Women have traditionally had limited access to higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Barbara Miller. ''In the Company of Educated Women.''&lt;/ref&gt; When women ''were'' admitted to higher education, they were encouraged to major in less-intellectual subjects; the study of [[English literature]] in American and British colleges and universities was instituted as a field considered suitable to women's "lesser intellects".&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, Terry. ''Literary Theory.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational specialties in higher education produce and perpetuate the existing segregation between men and women. Disparity persists particularly in computer and [[information science]], where women receive only 21 percent of the undergraduate degrees, and in [[engineering]], women obtain only 19 percent of the degrees in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, M. Sonnert G. and Nikiforova, I., 2011, Programs for Undergraduate Women in Science and Engineering: Issues, Problems, and Solutions, Gender and Society, 25 vol., p. 590&lt;/ref&gt;

World literacy is lower for females than for males. Latest data from CIA World Factbook shows that 79.7% of women are literate, compared to 88.6% of men (aged 15 and over).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html&lt;/ref&gt; In some parts of the world, girls continue to be excluded from proper public or private education. In parts of [[Afghanistan]], girls who go to school face serious violence from some local community members and religious groups.&lt;ref name="edition.cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/02/world/meast/cnnheroes-jan-afghan-school/index.html | work=CNN | title=Acid attacks, poison: What Afghan girls risk by going to school - CNN.com | date=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="edition.cnn.com"/&gt;
According to 2010 UN estimates, only [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Yemen]] had less than 90 girls per 100 boys at school.&lt;ref&gt;"Making Room for Girls" (2013), Retrieved from http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/11/gender-inequality.&lt;/ref&gt; Greater variation of gender educational discrepancy exists within countries. The situation appears to be more critical in rural areas, for instance  [[UNICEF]] statistics revealed that in Nigerian villages less than 40 girls per 100 boys gained access to primary education.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/nigeria_statistics.html&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of [[Sri Lanka]] economic development suggested that increased life expectancy of girls encourages educational investment because a longer time horizon increases the value of investments that pay out over time.&lt;ref&gt;JAYACHANDRAN S. AND LLERAS-MUNEY A., 2009, Life expectancy and human capital investments: evidence from material mortality declines, available at http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Girls' educational opportunities and results have greatly improved in the West. Since 1991, the proportion of women enrolled in college in the United States has exceeded the enrollment rate for men; the gap has widened over time.&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Education Statistics, http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2005/2005028.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, women made up the majority—54 percent—of the 10.8&amp;nbsp;million college students enrolled in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prb.org/Articles/2007/CrossoverinFemaleMaleCollegeEnrollmentRates.aspx |title=The Crossover in Female-Male College Enrollment Rates |publisher=Prb.org |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found that discrimination continues; boys receive more attention, praise, blame and punishment in the grammar-school classroom,&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, Diane F. ''Sex differences in cognitive abilities.'' Laurence Erlbaum Associates, 2000. ISBN 0-8058-2792-7.

The assigning of gender specific baby clothes from young ages is seen as sexist by some as it can instil in children from young ages a belief in strong gender stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/julie-bindel-boys-arent-born-wanting-to-wear-blue-6293688.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Julie | last=Bindel | title=Julie Bindel: Boys aren't born wanting to wear blue | date=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the assignment in some countries of the color [[pink]] to girls and [[blue]] to boys. This fashion, however, is a recent one; at the beginning of the 20th century the trend was the opposite: blue for girls and pink for boys. In the early 1900s, The Women's Journal wrote: "That pink being a more decided and stronger colour, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl." ''DressMaker'' magazine also explained: "The preferred colour to dress young boys in is pink. Blue is reserved for girls as it is considered paler, and the more dainty of the two colours, and pink is thought to be stronger (akin to red)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7817496.stm | work=BBC News | title=Should we not dress girls in pink? | date=January 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before roughly this date various styles of long robes were in any case commonly worn by adult males of various sorts, so boys wearing them could probably not be said to form a distinct phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; until the late 19th or early 20th century, young boys in the [[Western world]] were [[Breeches|unbreeched]] and wore [[gown]]s or [[dress]]es until an age that varied between two and eight.&lt;ref&gt;Baumgarten, Linda: ''What Clothes Reveal: The Language of Clothing in Colonial and Federal America'', p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Also, throughout much of the history, in most cultures, men have worn skirt-like clothes and worn long hair. In many parts of the world, such as much of sub-Saharan Africa, it is considered normal for women to wear very short hair, with the hairstyles of boys being the same to those of girls.

=== Female infanticide and sex-selective abortion ===
{{Main|Sex-selective abortion|Missing women of Asia}}
[[File:Something you wouldn't see in America.jpg|thumb| Female infanticide is still a major problem in India.]]
[[Female infanticide]] is the killing of very young female children. It is an extreme form of [[gender based violence]].&lt;ref name="eige.europa.eu"&gt;http://eige.europa.eu/content/what-is-gender-based-violence&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/abortion/medical/infanticide_1.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gsdrc.org/go/topic-guides/gender/gender-based-violence&lt;/ref&gt; Female infanticide is more common than male infanticide, and is especially prevalent in parts of [[Asia]], such as parts of [[India]] and [[People's Republic of China|China]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6934540.stm | work=BBC News | first=Nick | last=Bryant | title=Girls at risk amid India's prosperity | date=August 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.domesticviolenceservices.com/female-infanticide.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies suggest that over 90 million [[Missing women of Asia|girls and women are missing]] in China and India as a result of systematic sex discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/24/opinion/24iht-edswami.html?_r=0 Missing: 50 million Indian girls]".

Sex-selective abortion involves terminating a pregnancy based upon the predicted gender of the baby. The [[abortion]] of female fetuses is most common in areas where the culture values male children over females,&lt;ref name="Goodkind"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goodkind, Daniel |year=1999 |title=Should Prenatal Sex Selection be Restricted?: Ethical Questions and Their Implications for Research and Policy |journal=Population Studies |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=49–61 |jstor=2584811 |doi=10.1080/00324720308069}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as parts of the [[People's Republic of China]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Korea]], [[Taiwan]], and the [[Caucasus]].&lt;ref name="Goodkind"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gettis"&gt;A.

ISBN 0-07-252183-X&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for this preference is that males are seen as generating more income than females. A 2011 report on ''[[Science Daily]]'' stated that the trend grew steadily during the previous decade, and would probably cause a future shortage of women.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Medical Association Journal (2011, March 14).

===Forced sterilization and forced abortion===
[[Forced sterilization]] and [[forced abortion]] are forms of gender-based violence.&lt;ref name="eige.europa.eu"/&gt;

Forced sterilization was practiced during the first half of the 20th century by many Western countries (including the US) and there are reports of this practice being currently employed in some countries, such as [[Uzbekistan]] and [[People's Republic of China|China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17612550 | work=BBC News | title=Uzbekistan's policy of secretly sterilising women | date=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01fjx63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/asia-pacific/china/130409/china-mother-dies-after-forced-sterilization-one-child-policy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/thousands-risk-forced-sterilization-china-2010-04-22&lt;/ref&gt;

Forced abortions are today associated mostly with China. Although they are not an official policy of the country, they result from government pressure on local officials who, in turn, employ strong-arm tactics on pregnant mothers. In 2012, a highy publicized case of a forced abortion involving the photo of the fetus has sparked international outrage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-18435126 | work=BBC News | title=China forced abortion photo sparks outrage | date=June 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female genital mutilation===
{{Main|Female genital mutilation}}
[[File:Campaign road sign against female genital mutilation (cropped).jpg|270px|thumb|Campaign against [[female genital mutilation]] in [[Uganda]].]]
[[Female genital mutilation]] (FGM), also known as female genital cutting and female circumcision, is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as "all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons". WHO states that, "The procedure has no health benefits for girls and women" and "Procedures can cause severe bleeding and problems urinating, and later cysts, infections, infertility as well as complications in childbirth increased risk of newborn death"&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/&lt;/ref&gt; and "FGM is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women. It reflects deep-rooted [[gender inequality|inequality between the sexes]], and constitutes an extreme form of [[gender discrimination|discrimination against women]]".&lt;ref name="WHO" /&gt; Feminist activist Seham Abd el Salam writes that FGM campaigners have been criticized by [[women's studies]] groups for their lack of recognition of male circumcision as a form of genital mutilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=El-Salam|first=Seham Abd|title=The Importance of Genital Mutilations to Gender Power Politics|journal=[[Al-Raida]]|year=2002/2003|volume=20|issue=99|page=42|publisher=Institute for Women’s Studies in the Arab World|quote=Women’s defense of men's right to bodily integrity and their work against MGM will not have a negative impact on their struggle against FGM.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2013 UNICEF report, 125 million women and girls in Africa and the Middle East have experienced FGM.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The highest prevalence in Africa is documented in [[Somalia]] (98 percent of women affected), [[Guinea]] (96 percent), [[Djibouti]] (93 percent), Egypt (91 percent), Eritrea (89 percent), Mali (89 percent), Sierra Leone (88 percent), Sudan (88 percent), Gambia (76 percent), Burkina Faso (76 percent), Ethiopia (74 percent), Mauritania (69 percent), Liberia (66 percent), and Guinea-Bissau (50 percent).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Hate-motivated sexual assault ===
Rape and sexual assault are considered to be acts of hate. Their relationship to sexism is the frequent desire on the part of the perpetrator for power over the victim. The Center for Women Policy Studies stated that "victims almost always are chosen for what they are rather than who they are"; a woman is more likely to be attacked because of her gender than her individuality.&lt;ref&gt;The National Center for Victims of Crime&lt;/ref&gt;

Research into factors motivating perpetrators of [[rape]] against women frequently reveals a pattern of hatred towards women and pleasure in inflicting psychological and physical trauma, rather than sexual interest.&lt;ref name=Lisak1988&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lisak, D.  |authorlink=David Lisak |author2=Roth, S.  | year = 1988  | title = Motivational factors in nonincarcerated sexually aggressive men | journal = J Pers Soc Psychol  | volume = 55 | issue = 5 | pages = 795–802 | pmid = 3210146 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.55.5.795}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Odem posits that rape is the result not of pathology but of systems of male dominance, cultural practices and beliefs which objectify and degrade women.&lt;ref name=Odem&gt;{{Cite book | author=Odem, Mary E.; |author2=Clay-Warner, Jody  | title=Confronting rape and sexual assault | year=1998 | publisher=Scholarly Resources | location=Wilmington, Del.  | isbn=978-0-8420-2599-7 | pages=i-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bangalore protests following Delhi gang-rape (photo - Jim Ankan Deka).jpg|thumb|People in [[Bangalore]], [[India]] demanding justice for young student who was [[2012 Delhi gang rape case|gang-raped in Delhi]] in December 2012]]
Mary Odem, Jody Clay-Warner and [[Susan Brownmiller]] consider that sexist attitudes are propagated by a series of myths about rape and rapists.&lt;ref name="Odem" /&gt;{{rp|130–140}} &lt;ref name=Brownmiller&gt;{{Cite book | author=Brownmiller, Susan | title=Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape | year=1992 | publisher=Penguin Books, Limited | location=New York  | isbn=978-0-14-013986-0 | page=480}}&lt;/ref&gt; They state that in contrast to those myths, rapists often plan a rape before they choose a victim&lt;ref name="Odem"/&gt; and [[acquaintance rape]] (not assault by a stranger) is the most common form of rape.&lt;ref name="Odem" /&gt;{{rp|xiv}}&lt;ref name=Bohmer&gt;{{Cite book | editor=Parrot, Andrea; Bechhofer, Laurie | author=Bohmer, Carol | chapter=Acquaintance rape and the law | title=Acquaintance rape: the hidden crime | year=1991 | publisher=Wiley | location=New York  | isbn=978-0-471-51023-9 | pages=317–333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odem also asserts that these rape myths propagate sexist attitudes about men, by perpetuating the belief that men cannot control their sexuality.&lt;ref name=Odem&gt;{{Cite book | author=Odem, Mary E.; |author2=Clay-Warner, Jody  | title=Confronting rape and sexual assault | year=1998 | publisher=Scholarly Resources | location=Wilmington, Del.  | isbn=978-0-8420-2599-7 | page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to [[acquaintance rape]], the "Men Can Stop Rape" movement has been implemented.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mencanstoprape.org/&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. military has begun a similar movement, with the slogan "My strength is for defending".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=13379 |title=News Release: DOD Releases Annual Sexual Assault Response and Prevention Report |publisher=Defense.gov |date=March 12, 2009 |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Yes Means Yes: Visions of Female Sexual Power and A World Without Rape''
by [[Jaclyn Friedman]] and [[Jessica Valenti]], it is argued that in the US rape is most often popularly depicted (in the media, in public discourse, in movies etc.) as stranger-rape (with a stereotypical stranger who "jumps out of the bushes"), despite the fact that most rapes do not fit this stereotype. In presenting rape in this way to the public, patriarchal society ensures that women are kept under control, at home/indoors, living their life according to traditional gender roles and expectations, dressed 'modestly'. This leads to an ideology that women are safe at home (ignoring rape by family members/partners), and to [[victim blaming|blaming of victims]].&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.ro/books?id=NyicMIxzkUwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Yes+Means+Yes:&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YW48UpOlH8KGtAb8p4CQCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Yes%20Means%20Yes%3A&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military service ===
{{see also|Military service|Israel#Military|l2=Israeli military}}
Military service has been considered a gender-specific duty. Some countries, such as [[Israel]], require military service regardless of gender. Others (such as [[Conscription in Finland|Finland]], [[Conscription in Turkey|Turkey]] and [[Conscription in Singapore|Singapore]]) still use a system of [[conscription]] which only requires military service for men, although women are permitted to serve voluntarily.

In the United States, all men must register with the [[Selective Service System]] within 30 days of their 18th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sss.gov/default.htm |title=Selective Service System: Welcome |publisher=Sss.gov |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system does not require women to register, leading to criticism that it discriminates against men by forcing them into a dangerous role based on gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://haergar06.wordpress.com/2008/01/19/selective-service-is-one-the-worst-and-most-sexist-discriminations-against-men/ |title=Selective Service is one of the Worst And Most Sexist Discriminations against Men &amp;#124; The Marketplace of Ideas |publisher=Haergar06.wordpress.com |date=January 19, 2008 |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Misandry ===
{{Main|Misandry}}
Misandry is the hatred of men and boys as a societal group or as individuals.

=== Misogyny ===
{{Main|Misogyny}}
Misogyny is the hatred of women and girls as a societal group or as individuals.

=== Sexual slavery ===
[[Image:Chinese girl from one of the Japanese Army's 'comfort battalions'.jpg|thumb|[[Rangoon]], [[Burma]]. August 8, 1945. A young [[Chinese diaspora|ethnic Chinese]] woman who was in one of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]'s "comfort battalions" is interviewed by an [[Royal Air force|RAF]] officer.]]
{{Main|Sexual slavery}}
Sexual slavery occurs when people are coerced into [[slavery]] for [[Human sexual activity|sexual]] [[exploitation]]. The incidence of sexual slavery by country has been studied and tabulated by [[UNESCO]] (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) with the cooperation of a number of international agencies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unescobkk.org/fileadmin/user_upload/culture/Trafficking/project/Graph_Worldwide_Sept_2004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual slavery also includes single-owner slavery, the ritual slavery associated with certain religious practices, slavery for primarily non-sexual purposes where non-consensual [[sex]] is common and [[forced prostitution]].

=== Transphobia ===
{{Main|Transphobia}}
{{See also|Phobia|l1=Phobia - terms for prejudice or discrimination}}
Transphobia refers to prejudice against transsexuality and transsexual (or transgender) people based on their gender identification. Whether intentional or not, transphobia can have negative consequences for the object of the negative attitude. The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender ([[LGBT]]) movement opposes sexism against transsexuals. One form of sexism against transsexuals is "women-only" and "men-only" events and organizations, which have been criticized for excluding trans women and trans men.&lt;ref&gt;"Michigan Women's Music Festival ends policy of discrimination against Transwomen" http://www.intraa.org/story/newmwmfpolicy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lesfest. http://www.lesbian.com/news/international_2003_1006.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment of victims of rape ===
Stigmatization of women and girls who have been raped is widespread in many cultures; is a result of gender inequality and patriarchal social norms; and affects the ability of victims to recover.&lt;ref name="whqlibdoc.who.int"&gt;http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2002/9241545615_chap6_eng.pdf?ua=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svri.org/rape.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
In many parts of the world, women who have been raped are ostracized, rejected by their families, subjected to violence - in extreme cases to [[honor killings]], because they are deemed to have brought 'shame' on their families.&lt;ref name="whqlibdoc.who.int"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13760895 | work=BBC News | title=Libya rape victims 'face honour killings' | date=June 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a strong connection between rape and [[forced marriage]], through practices such as  forcing of a woman or girl who has been raped to marry her rapist, in order to restore the 'honor' of her family;&lt;ref name="whqlibdoc.who.int"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-17379721&lt;/ref&gt; or [[marriage by abduction]], a practice in which a man abducts the woman or girl whom he wishes to marry and rapes her, in order to force the marriage (this practice is very common in [[Ethiopia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/371944.stm | work=BBC News | title=Ethiopia: Revenge of the abducted bride | date=June 18, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irinnews.org/report/69993/ethiopia-surviving-forced-marriage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pathfinder.org/publications-tools/pdfs/Causes-and-Consequesnces-of-Early-Marriage-in-the-Amhara-Region-of-Ethiopia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;). The criminalization of [[marital rape]] (forcing one's own spouse to have sex) is very recent, having occurred during the past few decades; and in many countries it is still legal. Several countries in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia made spousal rape illegal before 1970; other countries in Western Europe and the English-speaking Western World outlawed it later, mostly in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.ro/books?id=VWttAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR1&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;dq=The+Routledge+Handbook+of+European+Criminology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=W397XfxDSQ&amp;sig=KC-3iBJ6HPkmE5WUZP9vldrwQFA&amp;hl=ro&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WhTUUsLiM8GTywONt4CYCw&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Routledge%20Handbook%20of%20European%20Criminology&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; In some parts of the world the lack of criminalization of marital rape coupled with the practice of child marriage leads to serious forms of [[child sexual abuse]] being legitimized. The WHO wrote that: "Marriage is often used to legitimize a range of forms of sexual violence against women. The custom of marrying off young children, particularly girls, is found in many parts of the world. This practice – legal in many countries – is a form
of sexual violence, since the children involved are unable to give or withhold their consent".&lt;ref name="whqlibdoc.who.int"/&gt; (see above the section on Child Marriage).

In countries where [[fornication]] or [[adultery]] are illegal, victims of rape can be charged under this laws (even if the victims succeed in proving their rape case, they can still be charged with a criminal offense if the court finds they were not [[virgins]] at the time of the assault - if they were unmarried).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-21595814&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO states that: "Persons who have been raped should receive treatment consistent with the dignity and respect they are owed as human beings."&lt;ref&gt;http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2004/924159263X.pdf?ua=1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== War rape ===
{{Main|War rape}}
[[File:DRC raped women.jpg|thumb|Meeting of victims of [[sexual violence]] in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.]]
War rapes are [[rape]]s committed by soldiers, other combatants or civilians during armed conflict, [[war]] or military occupation, and are distinguished from in-service sexual assault and rape committed amongst troops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theconservativeblog.co.uk/?p=2382 "30% of Women in USA Military Raped Whilst Serving by Fellow Soldiers"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103844570 "The Nation: The Plight of Women Soldiers"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3848/ "Why Soldiers Rape - Culture of misogyny, illegal occupation, fuel sexual violence in military"]&lt;/ref&gt; It also encompasses situations in which women are forced into prostitution or [[sexual slavery]] by an occupying power, such as Japanese [[comfort women]] during World War II. Sexual violence and rape as a weapon of war also affects a large number of men, although it is less-often reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/jul/17/the-rape-of-men|title=The rape of men|last1=Storr|first1=Will|date=16 July 2011|work=The Observer|accessdate=8 March 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war-torn [[Sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of the Congo]] has been described as the "rape capital of the world" with more than 400,000 rapes reported in just one year.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/400000-rapes-in-congo-in-one-year-2283102.html 400,000 rapes in Congo in one year]". ''[[The Independent]]''. May 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Antisexism movements ==
{{See also|Women's rights|Men's rights}}
In [[Ecuador]], the Pink Helmets (''Cascos Rosas''), created in May 2011 by 18-year-olds Freddy Caleron and Damian Valencia, sought to unite young men against [[machismo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saynotoviolence.org/join-say-no/ecuador-pink-helmets-say-no-violence-against-women Saynotoviolence.com].&lt;/ref&gt; The Pink Helmets published a manual with suggestions to end violence in society, relationships, within families, and among friends. The Pink Helmets' founders and participating members, who call themselves ''neomasculinos'' and are 15–20 years old, visit schools and the streets to give talks and participate in festivals (such as the [[Quito Fest]]) in collaboration with [[UN Women]] (part of the United Nations) to increase awareness of violence and the movement against it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwomen.org/2011/11/espanol-los-jovenes-lideran-la-lucha-por-la-igualdad-y-contra-la-violencia-de-genero-en-ecuador/ UN Women].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chauvinism]] and violence are common in Ecuador, with 40% of children under age 15 saying that they have witnessed acts of violence at home.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} According to the ''National Plan for the Eradication of Gender Violence of the Government of Ecuador'', 80% of women have been victims of violence at least once and 21% of children and adolescents have been sexually abused&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/america/2011/10/02/noticias/1317569157.html "Unos jóvenes combaten el machismo en Ecuador con cascos rosas"], ''El Mundo''.&lt;/ref&gt; (no official data provide a concrete number of women who have been killed or injured by men). The movement aims to promote gender equality, eliminate gender violence against women and encourage a "dialogue of respect between men and women from adolescence without hesitation to criticize sexist concepts that live in their culture".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larepublica.pe/02-10-2011/ecuador-jovenes-combaten-el-machismo-con-cascos-rosas LaRepublica].&lt;/ref&gt;
