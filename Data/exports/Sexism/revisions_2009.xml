'''Sexism,''' a term coined in the mid-20th century,&lt;ref&gt;[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]], 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; edition&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[belief]] or attitude that one [[gender]] or [[sex]] is inferior to, less [[Competence (human resources)|competent]], or less valuable than the other. It can also refer to [[hatred]] of, or [[prejudice]] towards, either [[gender|sex]] as a whole (see [[misogyny]] and [[misandry]]), or the application of [[stereotype]]s of [[masculinity]] in relation to [[men]], or of [[femininity]] in relation to [[women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Many men and women espousing [[feminism]], [[masculism]] and other ideologies have worked toward dispelling sexist beliefs.

== Generalization and partition ==
In philosophy, sexist attitudes can be understood or judged on the basis of the [[essentialism|essential characteristics]] of the group to which an individual belongs&amp;mdash;in this case, their sexual group, as men or women. This assumes that all individuals fit into the category of ''male'' or ''female'' and does not take into account [[intersex]]ed people who are born with a mixture of male and female sexual characteristics.&lt;!-- Note: the mixed sexual characteristics are not necessarily _primary_ sexual characteristics. Ambiguous genitalia (primary) are not a _sine qua non_ of intersexuality. See the page on Intersex for more details. --&gt; This also assumes a significant degree of [[wiktionary:Homogeneity|homogeneity]] in the characteristics of men and women respectively, and generally does not take into account the differences that exist within these groups. [[46,XY|XY males]] and [[46,XX|XX females]] who are genetically one sex but have developed the characteristics of the opposite sex during the foetal stage are usually considered with respect to their [[wiktionary:Phenotype|phenotypes]] under this system.&lt;ref&gt;"What is AIS?"

=== Sexism against women ===
{{Discrimination sidebar}}
''See also: [[Women's suffrage]]''&lt;br /&gt;
''See also: [[Coverture]]''

The view that men are superior to women is a form of sexism.  The term 'sexism' is sometimes used by itself to mean sexism against women.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sexism&lt;/ref&gt; When expressed by men, sexism against women may be called [[male chauvinism]]. Related terms are ''[[misogyny]]'', which implies a ''hatred'' of women, and ''[[wikt:gynophobia|gynophobia]]'', which refers to a ''fear'' of women or [[femininity]].

The idea that men benefit from certain rights and privileges not available to women is referred to as [[male privilege]].

Historically, sexism against women has taken a number of forms. 

====Stereotypes====

====Legal status====

U.S. and English law subscribed until the 20th century to the system of [[coverture]], whereby "[b]y marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law; that is the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage."&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone, William. ''Commentaries on the Laws of England.''http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/xBlack.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Not until 1875 were women in the U.S. legally defined as persons (Minor v Happersett, 88 U.S. 162),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legacy98.org/timeline.html&lt;/ref&gt; and women did not receive the vote in the U.S. until 1920&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legacy98.org/timeline.html&lt;/ref&gt; and in the U.K. until 1918.

====Domestic violence====

According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice, women are more likely than men to experience "nonfatal intimate partner violence." &lt;ref&gt;U.S. Bureau of Justice. "Intimate Partner Violence in the U.S." http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/intimate/ipv.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Women are more likely to be killed by intimate partners; 30% of female homicide victims are estimated to have been killed by intimate partners, as opposed to 5% of male homicide victims.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Bureau of Justice. "Intimate Partner Violence in the U.S." http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/intimate/ipv.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rape====

Analysis of perpetrators of rape against women has been argued to reveal a pattern of hatred of women and pleasure in inflicting psychological and/or physical trauma, rather than sexual interest.  According to Mary Odem and Jody Clay-Warner, feminists and social scientists have argued that rape is not the result of pathological individuals, but rather of systems of male dominance and from cultural practices and beliefs that objectify and degrade women.&lt;ref name=Odem&gt;{{Cite book | author=Odem, Mary E.; | coauthors=Clay-Warner, Jody | title=Confronting rape and sexual assault | date=1998 | publisher=Scholarly Resources | location=Wilmington, Del.  | isbn=978-0-8420-2599-7 | pages=i-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odem and Clay-Warner, along with Susan Brownwiller, consider sexist attitudes to be propagated by a series of myths about rape and rapists.&lt;ref name=Brownmiller&gt;{{Cite book | author=Brownmiller, Susan | title=Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape | date=1992 | publisher=Penguin Books, Limited | location=New York  | isbn=9780140139860 | pages=480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Odem, Mary E.; | coauthors=Clay-Warner, Jody | title=Confronting rape and sexual assault | date=1998 | publisher=Scholarly Resources | location=Wilmington, Del.  | isbn=978-0-8420-2599-7 | pages=130-140}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They state that contrary to these myths, rapists often plan a rape before they choose a victim,&lt;ref name="Odem"/&gt; and that [[acquaintance rape]] is the most common form of rape rather than assault by a stranger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Odem, Mary E.; | coauthors=Clay-Warner, Jody | title=Confronting rape and sexual assault | date=1998 | publisher=Scholarly Resources | location=Wilmington, Del.  | isbn=978-0-8420-2599-7 | page=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bohmer&gt;{{Cite book | editor=Parrot, Andrea; Bechhofer, Laurie | author=Bohmer, Carol | chapter=Acquaintance rape and the law | title=Acquaintance rape: the hidden crime | date=1991 | publisher=Wiley | location=New York  | isbn=978-0-471-51023-9 | pages=317-333}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Odem also states that these rape myths propagate sexist attitudes about men by perpetuating a myth that men cannot control their sexuality.&lt;ref name=Odem&gt;{{Cite book | author=Odem, Mary E.; | coauthors=Clay-Warner, Jody | title=Confronting rape and sexual assault | date=1998 | publisher=Scholarly Resources | location=Wilmington, Del.  | isbn=978-0-8420-2599-7 | page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexual objectification====

It is argued that [[sexual objectification]] is a form of sexism.

====Sexism in language====

See [[Gender-neutral language]].

In the USA (up to 2009) often used to mean speaker "assumes the gender" of the subject, specifically that the speaker assumes that the subject is either male or is female. This is because of stereotypes based on the content and context of the discussion, whether necessary or ethnically determined.

====Education====

Women in the past have been excluded from higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Barbara Miller. ''In the Company of Educated Women.''&lt;/ref&gt; When women were admitted to higher education, they were encouraged to major in subjects that were considered less intellectual; the study of English literature in English and U.S. colleges and universities was in fact instituted as a field of study considered suitable to women's "lesser intellects."&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, Terry. ''Literary Theory.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Research studies have found that discrimination continues today: boys receive more attention and praise in the classroom in grade school,&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, Diane F. ''Sex differences in cognitive abilities.'' Laurence Erlbaum Associates, 2000. ISBN 080582792. Page 259.&lt;/ref&gt; and "this pattern of more active teacher attention directed at male students continues at the postsecondary level."&lt;ref&gt;Sadker, Myra, and David Sadker. "Confronting Sexism in the College Classroom." In ''Gender in the Classroom: Power and Pedagogy.'' Ed. Susan L. Gabriel and Isaiah Smithson. Page 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, female students speak less and less in classroom settings.&lt;ref&gt;Sadker, Myra, and David Sadker. "Failing at Fairness: Hidden Lessons." In ''Mapping the social landscape: readings in sociology.'' Ed. Sandra J. Ferguson, [[Susan J. Ferguson]]. Taylor &amp; Francies, 1999. ISBN 0767406168. Page 350.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Professions====

Women have been excluded from participation in many professions. When women have gained entry into a previously male profession, they have faced many additional obstacles; [[Elizabeth Blackwell]], the first woman to receive an M.D., and [[Myra Bradwell]], the first female lawyer, are examples.

Discrimination continues today, according to studies done by [[Cornell University]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, Sam. "Women Excluded from Executive Positions." http://cornellsun.com/section/news/content/2008/03/31/report-women-excluded-exec-positions&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Melanie. "At the top, women still can't get a break from stereotypes." http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=401046&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 study of [[chief executive officer|CEOs]] found that more men occupying the position were overweight or obese than men in the general population, while the reverse held true for female CEOs.  The leader of the study stated that the results "suggest that while being obese limits the career opportunities of both women and men, being merely overweight harms only female executives -- and may actually benefit male executives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25317149-662,00.html| title = Women's careers more tied to weight than men -- study| accessdate = 2009-04-10| author = Julie Moult| date = 11 April, 2009| publisher = ''[[news.com.au]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender wage gap====
{{Main|Income disparity}}

''See also: [[Male–female income disparity in the United States]]''

Women have historically earned less than men; the reasons for the current wage gaps are also the subject of controversy.

In the 19th century and for much of the 20th, women were paid less than men for the same work. In the [[USA|United States]], this eventually led to the passing of the U.S. [[Equal Pay Act]] in 1963. At that time, women earned approximately 58 cents to a man's dollar.&lt;ref&gt;The White House. "Explaining Trends in the Gender Wage Gap." http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/EOP/CEA/html/gendergap.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, women in the [[United States]] are estimated to earn roughly 75 percent of the income of men.&lt;ref&gt;Longley, Robert. "Gender Wage Gap Widening, Census Data Shows." http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/censusandstatistics/a/paygapgrows.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The White House. "Explaining Trends in the Gender Wage Gap." http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/EOP/CEA/html/gendergap.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, unmarried women without children may earn 15 to 20 percent more than males in the same situation, depending upon geographical location in the US.&lt;ref name=forbesfmore&gt;http://www.forbes.com/ceonetwork/2006/05/12/women-wage-gap-cx_wf_0512earningmore.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Sam. "For Young Earners in the Big City, A Gap in Women's Favor." http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/03/nyregion/03women.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

Women are less likely to negotiate raises, and when they do negotiate, they are less likely to receive them.&lt;ref&gt;Babcock, L. &amp; Laschever, S. (2003) Women Don’t Ask: Negotiation and the Gender Divide. Princeton University Press &lt;/ref&gt;. [[David R. Hekman]] and colleagues found that women are less likely to negotiate because they are less valuable in the marketplace than equally well performing white men &lt;ref&gt;Hekman, David R.; Aquino, Karl; Owens, Brad P.; Mitchell, Terence R.; Schilpzand, Pauline; Leavitt, Keith. (2009) An Examination of Whether and How Racial and Gender Biases Influence Customer Satisfaction. Academy of Management Journal. http://journals.aomonline.org/inpress/main.asp?action=preview&amp;art_id=610&amp;p_id=1&amp;p_short=AMJ&lt;/ref&gt;  Hekman et al. (2009) found that customers who viewed videos featuring a black male, a white female, or a white male actor playing the role of an employee helping a customer were 19% more satisfied with the white male employee's performance and also were more satisfied with the store's cleanliness and appearance. This despite that all three actors performed identically, read the same script, and were in the exact same location with identical camera angles and lighting.   Moreover, 45 percent of the customers were women and 41 percent were non-white, indicating that even women and minority customers prefer white men.  In a second study, they found that white male doctors were rated as more approachable and competent than equally-well performing women or minority doctors. They interpret their findings to suggest that employers are willing to pay more for white male employees because employers are customer driven and customers are happier with white male employees.  They also suggest that what is required to solve the problem of wage inequality isn't necessarily paying women more but changing customer biases. This paper has been featured in many media outlets including [[The New York Times]],&lt;ref&gt; Bakalar, Nicholas (2009) “A Customer Bias in Favor of White Men.” New York Times. June 23, 2009, page D6. http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/health/research/23perc.html?ref=science &lt;/ref&gt; [[The Washington Post]],&lt;ref&gt;Vedantam, Shankar (2009) “Caveat for Employers.” Washington Post, June 1, 2009, page A8 http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/31/AR2009053102081.html &lt;/ref&gt;[[The Boston Globe]],&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Derrick (2009) “Subtle, and stubborn, race bias.” Boston Globe, July 6, 2009, page A10 http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2009/07/06/subtle_and_stubborn_race_bias/ &lt;/ref&gt; and [[National Public Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;National Public Radio, Lake Effect, http://www.wuwm.com/programs/lake_effect/view_le.php?articleid=754&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps because women are less valuable to customers than men, women are more likely to work part-time, to take more time off for their children, and join lower status professions.&lt;ref&gt;Lips, Hilary. "Blaming Women's Choices for the Gender Pay Gap." http://www.womensmedia.com/new/Lips-Hilary-blaming-gender-pay-gap.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Longley, Robert. "Why Women Still Make Less Than Men." http://usgovinfo.about.com/cs/censusstatistic/a/womenspay.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

A report published by the [[White House]] in 1998 argued that a gender pay gap remains even after taking into account such factors as relative experience, part-time vs. full-time work, differences between professions, and taking time off to have children.&lt;ref&gt;The White House. "Explaining Trends in the Gender Wage Gap." http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/EOP/CEA/html/gendergap.html&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has found that even after accounting for parenthood status, education, job title, and other factors, there is still a significant income disparity in men's favor (Blau and Kahn 1997, Wood et al. 1993).
Research done at [[Cornell University]] and elsewhere indicates that mothers are 44 percent less likely to be hired than women with otherwise identical resumes, experience, and qualifications, and, if hired, are offered on average $USD 11,000 a year less than women without children.&lt;ref&gt;MomsRising.org. ''The Motherhood Manifesto.'' http://www.momsrising.org/node/251&lt;/ref&gt; Exactly the opposite form of discrimination is indicated for men; those without children earn, on average, [[USD|$]]7,500 less than men with children.&lt;ref&gt;Lips, Hilary. "Blaming Women's Choices for the Gender Pay Gap." http://www.womensmedia.com/new/Lips-Hilary-blaming-gender-pay-gap.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies done show that transsexual men earn an average of 1.5% more after their transition, whereas transsexual women earn an average of 32% less.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, John. "If Women Were More Like Men." http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1847194,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexism against men ===

The view that women are superior to men is another form of sexism, and when expressed by a woman may be called [[female chauvinism]] or [[misandry]].  The hatred of men is called ''[[misandry]]'', while ''[[androphobia]]'' refers to the fear of men or [[masculinity]].

Several aspects of society have been viewed as forms of sexism against men, such as the systemic preference in Western societies to give mothers more rights than fathers over both children and unborn fetuses.

====Stereotyping====

[[Wendy McElroy]] refers to male stereotyping when she argues that in some "[[Gender feminism|gender feminist]]" views, all men are considered irreconcilable rapists, wife-beating brutes,man hater, and useless as partners or fathers to women.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy McElroy, ''Sexual Correctness: The Gender-Feminist Attack on Women'', p.{{Specify|date=February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; McElroy and Camille Paglia argue that certain feminists they refer to as "gender feminists" view women as innocent victims who never make irresponsible or morally questionable choices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.menweb.org/paglsomm.htm Guests: Camille Paglia &amp; Christina Hoff Sommers ''Has Feminism Gone Too Far?'' Think Tank With Ben Wattenberg - aired: 4 Nov 1994] accessed 6 Jan 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other feminists such as Kate Fillion have questioned the idea that women are always innocent victims and men always the guilty victimizers when the interests of each collide with those of the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatrice.com/interviews/fillion/|title=Kate Fillion, ''Lip Service: The Truth About Women's Darker Side in Love, Sex and Friendship''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marginalization====

In 1997, the Canadian Advertising Foundation ruled that a National Ad campaign that featuring [[Nicole Brown Simpson]]'s sister Denise with the slogan, "Stop violence against Women" was in fact portraying only men as aggressors, and that it was not providing a balanced message and was in fact contributing to gender stereotyping. (The murder of Nicole Simpson also included the murder of [[Ronald Goldman]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Power of One'', [[Pamela Bron]], Chronicle-Journal, Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada, April 18, 1997, p. B1&lt;/ref&gt;

====Domestic violence====

The U.S. Center for Disease Control in conjunction with the American Psychiatric Association found that of heterosexual relationships involving violence, 50.3% involve non-reciprocal violence, and of that 50.3%, women were the instigators 70.7% of the time, although "physical injury was more likely to occur when the violence was reciprocal."&lt;ref&gt;http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/42/15/31-a&lt;/ref&gt; Men have no laws such as VAWA or Violence Against Women Act that afford them equal protection under law. Linda Kelly states in her thesis, ''Disabusing the Definition of Domestic Abuse: How Women Batter Men and the Role of the Feminist State'' in the Florida State University Law Review that domestic violence is equally the province of women.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.fsu.edu/Journals/lawreview/downloads/304/kelly.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mandatory military service====
[[Military_service#Countries_with_mandatory_military_service|Many countries]] around the world make it mandatory for males to join the military, but not females.
Men at 18 years of age in the United States are required to register for military conscription to be drafted to war or military service. Women are not required to register with the [[Selective Service System]] and have no obligation to serve in the military in the case of a draft.

=== Sexism against transsexuals ===
{{Main|Transphobia}}
Transphobia refers to prejudice against transsexuality and transsexual or transgender people, based on their personal gender identification (see [[Phobia#Terms indicating prejudice or class discrimination|Phobia - terms indicating prejudice or class discrimination]]). Whether intentional or not, transphobia can have severe consequences for the person the object of the negative attitude. The [[LGBT]] movement has campaigned against sexism against transsexuals. The most typical forms of sexism against transsexuals are how many "women-only" and "men-only" events and organizations have been criticized for rejecting trans women and trans men, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;"Michigan Women's Music Festival ends policy of discrimination against Transwomen" http://www.intraa.org/story/newmwmfpolicy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lesfest. http://www.lesbian.com/news/international_2003_1006.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexism and sexual expression ==
The expression of sexual intimacy is a part of the [[human condition]]. However, various aspects of human sexuality have been argued as having contributed to sexism.

=== The sexual revolution ===
During the [[sexual revolution]], there was a change in the cultural perception of sexual morality and sexual behavior. The sexual revolution has been known as the [[sexually liberal feminism|sexual liberation]] by [[feminist]]s since some saw this new development in the West as a leveling ground for females to have as many choices concerning their sexuality as males—hoping to eliminate the problematic [[virgin/whore dichotomy]] of traditional Western society.

[[Ariel Levy]] argues that the current state of commercial sexuality has created a "[[Raunch Culture]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Female Chauvinist Pigs|first=Ariel|last=Levy|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that there has been a commercialization of the sexual objectification of women; a cultural, largely Western development that she criticizes as being limiting for men and women. Some feminists argue that rather than being liberating, that a "pornification" of Western society has reduced and equated the scope of feminine power to sexual power only. They argue that women are themselves objectifying other women by becoming producers and promoters of the "Raunch Culture".

Some [[masculist]]s posit that prior to the sexual revolution the idealized male was expected to be virile while the idealized female was expected to be modest. They argue that after the sexual revolution, women were given more liberty to express virility while the reverse has not been true for men, who have yet to be given a choice to be non-virile. They argue that the dual identity of [[hypersexuality]] and [[asexuality]] is a luxury and special status that only exists for women.{{Fact|date=June 2009}} However, many feminists argue that the [[Madonna-whore complex|virgin/whore dichotomy]] has existed since long before the sexual revolution and that it entails unrealistic categories imposed on women by men, not chosen voluntarily. This dichotomy allows men to condemn women for their sexuality whether it is seen as modest or virile, a [[no-win situation]] and a [[double standard]] since they argue that this does not apply to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Beauty and Misogyny|first=Sheila|last=Jeffreys|year=2005|pages=37, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dehumanizing Women: Treating Persons as Sex Objects|first=Linda|last=LeMoncheck|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=1985|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pornography ===
{{Main|Feminist views on pornography}}
[[Radical feminists]] hold the view that [[pornography]] contributes to sexism, arguing that in pornographic performances for male spectators, actresses are reduced to mere receptacles—objects—for sexual use and abuse by men.

=== Prostitution ===
[[Radical feminists]] argue that [[prostitution]] is a sexist practice, which exploits women and which is the result of the existing patriarchal societal order, hence the laws from [[Sweden]], [[Norway]] and [[Iceland]], where it is illegal to pay for sex, but not to be a prostitute (the client commits a crime, but not the prostitute).

== Anti-sexism ==
Anti-sexism is opposition to sexism, anti-sexist is one who opposes sexism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/anti-sexist?qsrc=2446]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feminism]] and [[masculism]] are also considered anti sexism.

== Sexism and language ==
It has been argued that sexual dichotomies exist in language, though it is disputed whether certain language causes sexism, sexism causes certain language (see the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]]) or that they are both caused by something else.

=== Sexist and gender-neutral language ===
Nearing the end of the 20th century, there is a rise in the use of gender-neutral language in western worlds. This is often attributed to the rise of [[feminism]]. [[Gender-neutral language]] is the avoidance of [[gender-specific job title]]s, [[Non-parallel usage#Disputed issues|non-parallel usage]], and other usage that is felt by some to be sexist. Supporters feel that having gender-specific titles and gender-specific pronouns either implies a system bias to exclude individuals based on their gender, or else is as unnecessary in most cases as race-specific pronouns, religion-specific pronouns, or persons-height-specific pronouns. Some of those who support gender-specific pronouns assert that promoting gender-neutral language is a kind of "[[semantics]] injection" itself. Some opponents dismiss this trend as "political correctness gone mad"{{Fact|date=June 2007}} and protest against what they see as [[censorship]]. Others like [[misandry]] researchers Nathonson and Young see the term 'gender' as a biased "front" for what they call "ideological" feminism{{Fact|date=June 2007}}.

=== Anthropological linguistics and gender-specific language ===
Unlike the [[Indo-European languages]] in the west, for many other [[languages]] around the world, [[gender-specific pronouns]] are a recent phenomenon that occur around the early-20th century. As a result of [[colonialism]], cultural revolution occurred in many parts of the world with attempts to "modernize" and "westernize" by adding gender-specific pronouns and animate-inanimate pronouns to local languages. This ironically resulted in the situation of what was [[gender-neutral pronouns]] a century ago suddenly becoming gender-specific. (See for example [[Gender-neutrality in languages without grammatical gender#Turkish|Gender-neutrality in languages without grammatical gender: Turkish]].)
{{Confusing|date=September 2007}}
In those parts of the world, some feminists, who are unaware of the etymology of their own language, complain about what they perceived as "sexist language" with arguments like "traditional language fails to reflect the presence of women in modern society adequately"{{Fact|date=June 2007}} similar to the west. However, other feminists, who are aware of historical linguistics, realize that the traditional language in their part of the world is inherently gender-neutral. They instead decide to revive the original gender-neutral usage from over a century ago with [[Reclaiming|reclamation]] projects.
For example, when the sex of something is unknown, is it always referred to as a "he," or when using the term "one," typically "himself" is used also. As well as those examples, in the phrase "him and her," the "him" always comes first. Furthermore, in some combined words such as "postman", the word man, which is clearly not gender neutral, is used, whereas woman, or a gender neutral alternative (which does not even exist in many languages), is never used.

=== Reappropriation and reclamation ===
'''Reappropriation''' (aka '''reclamation projects''') describe a cultural process by which certain groups reclaim or re-appropriate terms, symbols, and artifacts that were previously used to discriminate. Within the [[English language]], terms like '[[bitch]]' and '[[slut]]', which had been historically used as [[pejorative]] sexist remarks against females. They have since been used to refer to a "strong, independent, unattached female" and a "[[Sexually liberal feminism|sexually liberal]], [[hypersexual]] female"{{Fact|date=June 2007}}. Similarly, terms like '[[girlie men]]' and '[[transgender|tranny']], which has been historically used as pejorative sexist remarks against [[transsex]]es, have since been used to refer to the varying degree of transexuality for "pre-operation" and "non-operation" as whether they had undergone or will undergo sex-reassignment or not. The success of these cultural process has been disputed.

On the flip side, the word 'dude' as a pejorative has crossed the sexes and is being applied to males. In politics, the term 'girlie men' has also been used by [[Governor Schwarzenegger]] to attack his political opponents, who are not transsexes. This has led to Schwarzenegger being accused of being sexist.

==Occupational sexism==
{{Main|Occupational sexism}}
Occupational sexism refers to any [[discriminatory]] practices, statements, actions, etc. based on a person's [[sex]] that are present or occur in a place of [[employment]]. One form of occupational sexism is wage discrimination, which is prohibited in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Sexual discrimination==
{{See also|Discrimination}}

Though sexism refers to beliefs and [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] in relation to the [[gender]] of a person, such beliefs and attitudes are of a social nature and do not, normally, carry any legal consequences. [[Discrimination|Sex discrimination]], on the other hand, may have legal consequences. Though what constitutes sex discrimination varies between countries, the essence is that it is an adverse action taken by one person against another person that would not have occurred had the person been of another sex. Discrimination of that nature in certain enumerated circumstances is illegal in many countries.

Sexual discrimination can arise in different contexts. For instance an employee may be discriminated against by being asked discriminatory questions during a job interview, or because an [[employer]] did not hire, promote or wrongfully terminated an employee based on his or her gender, or employers pay unequally based on gender. In an educational setting there could be claims that a student was excluded from an educational institution, program, opportunity, loan, student group, or scholarship on account of his or her gender. In the housing setting there could be claims that a person was refused negotiations on seeking a house, contracting/leasing a house or getting a loan based on his or her gender.

Socially, sexual differences have been used to justify different roles for men and women, in some cases giving rise to claims of primary and secondary roles.{{Fact|date=May 2008}} While there are non-physical differences between men and women, there is little agreement as to what those differences are.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

The [[United Nations]] has stated (2006) that women struggle to break through a "[[glass ceiling]]," and that "progress in bringing women into leadership and decision-making positions around the world remains far too slow."&lt;ref name="UN-IWD2006"&gt;{{cite web

in parliaments, yet even at this rate, parity between women and men in parliaments
will not be reached until 2040."&lt;ref name="UN-IWD2006" /&gt;

The term "glass ceiling" is used to describe a perceived barrier to advancement in employment and government based on discrimination, especially sex discrimination. In the [[United States]], the Glass Ceiling Commission, a government-funded group, stated: "Over half of all Master’s degrees are now awarded to women, yet 95% of senior-level managers, of the top Fortune 1000 industrial and 500 service companies are men. Of them, 97% are white." In its report, it recommended [[reverse discrimination]], which is the consideration of an employee's gender and race in hiring and promotion decisions, as a means to end this form of discrimination.&lt;ref name="Glass Ceiling Commission"&gt;{{cite web

[[transsexualism|Transgendered]] individuals, both male to female and female to male, often experience problems which often lead to dismissals, underachievement, difficulty in finding a job, social isolation, and, occasionally, violent attacks against them.
