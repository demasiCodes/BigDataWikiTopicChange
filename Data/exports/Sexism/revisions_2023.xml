'''Sexism''' is [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]] based on one's [[sex]] or [[gender]]. Sexism can affect anyone, but primarily affects [[women]] and [[girl]]s.&lt;!--NOTE: Consensus among WP: Reliable sources, assessed via WP: Due weight, is that sexism is typically against women. Before removing this text, raise the issue on the talk page first.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Sexism"&gt;There is a clear and broad consensus among academic scholars in multiple fields that sexism refers primarily to discrimination against women, and primarily affects women. See, for example:

* {{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica, Online Academic Edition |year=2015}} Defines sexism as "prejudice or discrimination based on sex or gender, especially against women and girls".

== Etymology and definitions ==

According to [[Fred R. Shapiro]], the term "sexism" was most likely coined on November 18, 1965, by Pauline M. Leet during a "Student-Faculty Forum" at [[Franklin and Marshall College]]. Specifically, the word sexism appears in Leet's forum contribution "Women and the Undergraduate", and she defines it by comparing it to racism, stating in part (on page&amp;nbsp;3): "When you argue&amp;nbsp;... that since fewer women write good poetry this justifies their total exclusion, you are taking a position analogous to that of the racist—I might call you, in this case, a 'sexist'&amp;nbsp;... Both the racist and the sexist are acting as if all that has happened had never happened, and both of them are making decisions and coming to conclusions about someone's value by referring to factors which are in both cases irrelevant."{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

Also, according to Shapiro, the first time the term "sexism" appeared in print was in [[Caroline Bird (American author)|Caroline Bird]]'s speech "On Being Born Female", which was published on November 15, 1968, in ''Vital Speeches of the Day'' (p.&amp;nbsp;6). In this speech she said in part: "There is recognition abroad that we are in many ways a sexist country. Sexism is judging people by their sex when sex doesn't matter. Sexism is intended to rhyme with racism."&lt;ref&gt;(Bird, C. (1968). ''Vital Speeches of the Day''. Vol. 35(3), p.90)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexism may be defined as an [[ideology]] based on the belief that one sex is superior to another.&lt;ref name="Schaefer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sociology in modules|last=T.|first=Schaefer, Richard|date=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-802677-5|location=New York, NY|page=525|oclc=663953971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sociology|last=J.|first=Macionis, John|date=2010|publisher=[[Pearson Education]]|isbn=978-0-205-74989-8|edition=13th|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|page=330|oclc=468109511}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is discrimination, prejudice, or stereotyping based on gender, and is most often expressed toward women and girls.&lt;ref name="Sexism"/&gt;

[[Sociology]] has examined sexism as manifesting at both the individual and the [[Social institution|institutional]] level.&lt;ref name="Schaefer"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sociology: A Brief Introduction|last=Schaefer|first=Richard T.|date=2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-340426-4|edition=8th|location=New York|pages=274–275|oclc=243941681}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Richard Schaefer, sexism is perpetuated by all major [[social institutions]].&lt;ref name="Schaefer"/&gt; Sociologists describe parallels among other ideological systems of oppression such as [[racism]], which also operates at both the individual and institutional level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sociology: the core|last=D.)|first=Hughes, Michael (Michael|date=2009|publisher=McGraw Hill/Higher Education|others=Kroehler, Carolyn J.|isbn=978-0-07-340425-7|edition=9th|location=Boston|page=247|oclc=276998849}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early female sociologists [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], [[Ida B. Wells]], and [[Harriet Martineau]] described systems of [[gender inequality]], but did not use the term ''sexism'', which was coined later. Sociologists who adopted the functionalist paradigm, e.g. [[Talcott Parsons]], understood gender inequality as the natural outcome of a dimorphic model of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=SOC 2018|last=Witt|first=Jon|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2017|isbn=978-1-259-70272-3|edition=5th|location=New York|page=301|oclc=968304061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychologist]]s Mary Crawford and [[Rhoda Unger]] define sexism as prejudice held by individuals that encompasses "negative attitudes and values about women as a group."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and gender: a feminist psychology|last=E.)|first=Crawford, Mary (Mary|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill|others=Unger, Rhoda Kesler.|isbn=978-0-07-282107-9|edition=4th|location=Boston|page=9|oclc=52706293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Glick and [[Susan Fiske]] coined the term ''[[ambivalent sexism]]'' to describe how stereotypes about women can be both positive and negative, and that individuals compartmentalize the stereotypes they hold into hostile sexism or benevolent sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and gender: a feminist psychology|last=E.)|first=Crawford, Mary (Mary|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill|others=Unger, Rhoda Kesler.|isbn=978-0-07-282107-9|edition=4th|location=Boston|pages=59–60|oclc=52706293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philosophy|Philosopher]] [[Kate Manne]] defines sexism as one branch of a [[patriarchy|patriarchal order]]. In her definition, sexism rationalizes and justifies patriarchal norms, in contrast with [[misogyny]], the branch which polices and enforces patriarchal norms. Manne says that sexism often attempts to make patriarchal social arrangements seem natural, good, or inevitable so that there appears to be no reason to resist them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Manne |first=Kate |author-link=Kate Manne |date=2019 |title=Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny |location=Ithaca, New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=78–79 |isbn=978-0-19-060498-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Witch hunts and trials ===

Title page of the seventh [[Cologne]] edition of the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'', 1520, from the [[University of Sydney Library]].&lt;ref&gt;The English translation is from [http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/notes/n192863.html this note] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006103829/http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/notes/n192863.html |date=October 6, 2013}} to [http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/mm00c7.html Summers' 1928 introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225301/http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/mm00c7.html |date=September 27, 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Sexism may have been the impetus that fueled the witch trials between the 15th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 01.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[early modern Europe]], and in the European colonies in North America, claims were made that [[witch]]es were a threat to [[Christendom]]. The misogyny of that period played a role in the persecution of these women.&lt;ref&gt;Barstow, Anne Llewellyn (1994) ''Witchcraze: A New History of the European Witch Hunts'' San Francisco: Pandora.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. pp. 42–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' by [[Heinrich Kramer]], the book which played a major role in the witch hunts and trials, the author argues that women are more likely to practice witchcraft than men, and writes that:

: All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman&amp;nbsp;... What else is a woman but a foe to friendship, an inescapable punishment, a necessary evil, a natural temptation, a desirable calamity, a domestic danger, a delectable detriment, an evil of nature, painted with fair colors!&lt;ref&gt;Kramer and Sprenger. Malleus Maleficarum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Witchcraft remains illegal in several countries, including [[Saudi Arabia]], where it is [[punishable by death]]. In 2011, a woman was beheaded in that country for "witchcraft and sorcery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/13/world/meast/saudi-arabia-beheading/ | work=[[CNN]].com | title=Saudi woman beheaded for 'witchcraft and sorcery' | date=December 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murders of women after being accused of witchcraft remain common in some parts of the world; for example, in [[Tanzania]], about 500 elderly women are murdered each year following such accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=World Health Organization |title=World Report on Violence Chapter 5 – Abuse of the elderly |url=https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/global_campaign/en/chap5.pdf |access-date=June 20, 2020 |website=who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When women are targeted with accusations of witchcraft and subsequent violence, it is often the case that several forms of discrimination interact – for example, discrimination based on gender with discrimination based on [[caste]], as is the case in India and Nepal, where such crimes are relatively common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Shrestha |first=Deepesh |date=February 15, 2010 |title=Witch-hunts of low-caste women in Nepal |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/7241937/Witch-hunts-of-low-caste-women-in-Nepal.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/7241937/Witch-hunts-of-low-caste-women-in-Nepal.html |archive-date=January 11, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |access-date=June 20, 2020}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Iaccino |first=Ludovica |date=July 22, 2014 |title=Witch Hunting in India: Poor, Low Caste and Widows Main Targets |work=International Business Times |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/witch-hunting-india-poor-low-caste-widows-main-targets-1457809 |access-date=June 20, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 20th century, U.S. and [[English law]] observed the system of [[coverture]], where "by marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law; that is the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage".&lt;ref name="blackstone"&gt;{{cite web|author=Blackstone, William|author-link=William Blackstone|title=Extracts from William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England 1765–1769|url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/xblack.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005032946/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/xblack.htm|archive-date=5 October 2008|access-date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. women were not legally defined as "persons" until 1875 (''[[Minor v.

Laws, regulations, and traditions related to marriage continue to discriminate against women in many parts of the world, and to contribute to the mistreatment of women, in particular in areas related to [[sexual violence]] and to self-determination regarding [[sexuality]], the violation of the latter now being acknowledged as a violation of [[women's rights]]. In 2012, [[Navi Pillay]], then [[High Commissioner for Human Rights]], stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Women are frequently treated as property, they are sold into marriage, into trafficking, into sexual slavery. Violence against women frequently takes the form of sexual violence. Victims of such violence are often accused of promiscuity and held responsible for their fate, while infertile women are rejected by husbands, families and communities. In many countries, married women may not refuse to have sexual relations with their husbands, and often have no say in whether they use contraception{{nbsp}}... Ensuring that women have full autonomy over their bodies is the first crucial step towards achieving substantive equality between women and men. Personal issues—such as when, how and with whom they choose to have sex, and when, how and with whom they choose to have children—are at the heart of living a life in dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pillay |first=Navi |author-link=Navi Pillay |date=2012 |title=Valuing women as autonomous beings: Women's sexual reproductive health rights |website=United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner |access-date=April 18, 2015 |url=http://www.chr.up.ac.za/images/files/news/news_2012/Navi%20Pillay%20Lecture%2015%20May%202012.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313210726/http://www.chr.up.ac.za/images/files/news/news_2012/Navi%20Pillay%20Lecture%2015%20May%202012.pdf |archive-date=March 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Suffrage and politics ===

[[File:Annie Kenney and Christabel Pankhurst.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Two woman carry a sign reading "Votes for Women". |[[Annie Kenney]] and [[Christabel Pankhurst]]]]

Gender has been used as a tool for discrimination against women in the political sphere. [[Women's suffrage]] was not achieved until 1893, when New Zealand was the first country to grant women the right to vote. Saudi Arabia is the most recent country, as of August 2015, to extend the right to vote to women in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline of Women's Suffrage Granted, by Country|url=https://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0931343.html|publisher=Infoplease|access-date=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Western countries allowed women the right to vote only relatively recently. [[Switzerland|Swiss]] women gained the right to vote in federal elections in 1971,&lt;ref name="switzerland-chronology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html |title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology |publisher=History-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch |access-date=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] became the last [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] to grant women the right to vote on local issues in 1991, when it was forced to do so by the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/WOM1373.doc.htm |title=United Nations press release of a meeting of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), issued on January 14, 2003 |publisher=Un.org |access-date=September 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; French women were granted the right to vote in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Pierre Maury|title=Ordonnance du 21 avril 1944 relative à l'organisation des pouvoirs publics en France après la Libération|url=http://mjp.univ-perp.fr/france/co1944-2.htm|access-date=January 8, 2011|publisher=Mjp.univ-perp.fr|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/femmes/citoyennete_politique_de-Gaulle.asp |title=La citoyenneté politique des femmes—La décision du Général de Gaulle |author=Assemblée nationale |access-date=December 19, 2007 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greece, women obtained the right to vote in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.db-decision.de/CoRe/Greece.htm|title=European Database: Women in Decision-making – y Country Report Greece|author=Kerstin Teske: teske@fczb.de|website=db-decision.de|access-date=June 11, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109110102/http://www.db-decision.de/CoRe/Greece.htm|archive-date=November 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Liechtenstein]], women obtained the right to vote in 1984, through the [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1984|women's suffrage referendum of 1984]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1066106.stm|title=BBC News—Timeline: Liechtenstein|access-date=14 June 2015|date=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/02/world/around-the-world-liechtenstein-women-win-right-to-vote.html|title=Liechtenstein Women Win Right to Vote|date=July 2, 1984|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While almost every woman today has the right to vote, there is still progress to be made for women in politics. Studies have shown that in several democracies including Australia, Canada, and the United States, women are still represented using gender stereotypes in the press.&lt;ref name="KittilsonFridkin2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kittilson|first1=Miki Caul|last2=Fridkin|first2=Kim|title=Gender, Candidate Portrayals and Election Campaigns: A Comparative Perspective|journal=[[Politics &amp; Gender]]|volume=4|issue=3|year=2008|issn=1743-923X|doi=10.1017/S1743923X08000330|s2cid=145574989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple authors have shown that gender differences in the media are less evident today than they used to be in the 1980s, but are still present. Certain issues (e.g., education) are likely to be linked with female candidates, while other issues (e.g., taxes) are likely to be linked with male candidates.&lt;ref name="KittilsonFridkin2008"/&gt; In addition, there is more emphasis on female candidates' personal qualities, such as their appearance and their personality, as females are portrayed as emotional and dependent.&lt;ref name="KittilsonFridkin2008"/&gt;

There is a widespread imbalance of lawmaking power between men and women. The ratio of women to men in legislatures is used as a measure of gender equality in the [[United Nations|United Nations']] [[Gender Empowerment Measure]] and its newer incarnation the [[Gender Inequality Index]]. Speaking about China, Lanyan Chen stated that, since men more than women serve as the gatekeepers of policy making, this may lead to women's needs not being properly represented. In this sense, the inequality in lawmaking power also causes gender discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen|first=Lanyan|title=The Gendered Reality of Migrant Workers in Globalizing China|date=2009|publisher=The [[University of Ottawa]]|location=Ottawa|isbn=978-0-7766-0709-2|pages=186–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Menus ====

Until the early 1980s, some high-end restaurants had two [[menu]]s: a regular menu with the prices listed for men and a second menu for women, which did not have the prices listed (it was called the "ladies' menu"), so that the female diner would not know the prices of the items.&lt;ref name="Frost"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/ladies-menus-no-prices-lawsuit |title=The Court Case That Killed the 'Ladies Menu' |last=Frost |first=Natasha |date= February 2, 2018 |website=www.atlasobscura.com |publisher=[[Atlas Obscura]]|access-date=February 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, Kathleen Bick took a male business partner out to dinner at L'Orangerie in West Hollywood. After she was given a women's menu without prices and her guest got one with prices, Bick hired lawyer [[Gloria Allred]] to file a discrimination lawsuit, on the grounds that the women's menu went against the California Civil Rights Act.&lt;ref name="Frost"/&gt; Bick stated that getting a women's menu without prices left her feeling "humiliated and incensed". The owners of the restaurant defended the practice, saying it was done as a courtesy, like the way men would stand up when a woman enters the room. Even though the lawsuit was dropped, the restaurant ended its gender-based menu policy.&lt;ref name="Frost"/&gt;

Through the experiment comparing the math outcomes of women under two various gender-math stereotype components, which are the ability of math and the effort on math respectively, Thoman and others found that women's math performance is more likely to be affected by the negative ability stereotype, which is influenced by sociocultural beliefs in the United States, rather than the effort component. As a result of this experiment and the sociocultural beliefs in the United States, Thoman and others concluded that individuals' academic outcomes can be affected by the gender-math stereotype component that is influenced by the sociocultural beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Thoman | first1=Dustin B. | last2=White | first2=Paul H. | last3=Yamawaki | first3=Niwako | last4=Koishi | first4=Hirofumi | year=2008 | title=Variations of Gender–math Stereotype Content Affect Women's Vulnerability to Stereotype Threat | journal=[[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume=58 | issue=9–10| pages=702–12 | doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9390-x| s2cid=144788626 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include:
* Using generic masculine terms to reference a group of mixed gender, such as "mankind", "man" (referring to humanity), "guys", or "officers and men"
* Using the singular masculine pronoun (he, his, him) as the default to refer to a person of unknown gender
* Terms ending in "-man" that may be performed by those of non-male genders, such as businessman, chairman, or policeman
* Using unnecessary gender markers, such as "male nurse" implying that simply a "nurse" is by default assumed to be female.&lt;ref name="Kennison &amp; Trofe 2002"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Kennison| first1=S. |last2=Trofe |first2=J. |title=Comprehending Pronouns: A Role for Word-Specific Gender Stereotype Information |journal=Journal of Psycholinguistic Research| volume=32| issue=3| year=2003| pages=355–378 |doi=10.1023/A:1023599719948 | pmid=12845944 | s2cid=26245038 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexist and gender-neutral language ===

{{See also|Gender-neutral language}}

Various 20th century feminist movements, from [[liberal feminism]] and [[radical feminism]] to [[standpoint feminism]], [[postmodern feminism]] and [[queer theory]], have considered language in their theorizing.&lt;ref&gt;Mille, Katherine Wyly and Paul McIlvenny. "Gender and Spoken Interaction: A Survey of Feminist Theories and Sociolinguistic Research in the United States and Britain." {{cite web|url=http://paul-server.hum.aau.dk/research/cv/Pubs/mille-mcilvenny.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 3, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309145105/https://paul-server.hum.aau.dk/research/cv/Pubs/mille-mcilvenny.pdf |archive-date=March 9, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these theories have maintained a critical stance on language that calls for a change in the way speakers use their language.

One of the most common calls is for gender-neutral language. Many have called attention, however, to the fact that the English language is not inherently sexist in its linguistic system, but the way it is used becomes sexist and gender-neutral language could thus be employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam034/90034404.pdf|title=Feminist literary studies: an introduction|website=catdir.loc.gov|access-date=November 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexism in languages other than English ===

[[Romanic languages]] such as [[French language|French]]&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/23/world/europe/france-drops-mademoiselle-from-official-use.html|title=France Drops 'Mademoiselle' From Official Use|last=Sayare|first=Scott|date=February 22, 2012|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 26, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-12843948 |title=Mexico advises workers on sexist language—BBC News |publisher=BBC|access-date=March 31, 2015|work=BBC News |date=March 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; may be seen as reinforcing sexism, in that the masculine form is the default. The word "[[wikt:mademoiselle|mademoiselle]]", meaning "[[miss]]", was declared banished from French administrative forms in 2012 by Prime Minister [[François Fillon]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Current pressure calls for the use of the masculine plural pronoun as the default in a mixed-sex group to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=40545648|title=Attacking a Legacy of Sexist Grammar in the French Class: A Modest Beginning|first=Culley Jane|last=Carson|date=1 January 1993|journal=Feminist Teacher|volume=7|issue=2|pages=34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for Spanish, Mexico's Ministry of the Interior published a guide on how to reduce the use of sexist language.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

[[German language|German]] speakers have also raised questions about how sexism intersects with grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nandi |first=Jacinta |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate-uk/2011/03/05/grappling-with-language-sexism/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307092229/http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate-uk/2011/03/05/grappling-with-language-sexism/ |archive-date=March 7, 2011 |title=Grappling with language sexism |publisher=blogs.reuters.com |date= March 5, 2011 |access-date=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German language is heavily inflected for gender, number, and case; nearly all nouns denoting the occupations or statuses of human beings are gender-differentiated. For more gender-neutral constructions, gerund nouns are sometimes used instead, as this eliminates the grammatical gender distinction in the plural, and significantly reduces it in the singular. For example, instead of ''die Studenten'' ("the men students") or ''die Studentinnen'' ("the women students"), one writes ''die Studierenden'' ("the [people who are] studying").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Osel|first=Johann|date=February 18, 2015|title=Gleichberechtigung im Studium: Studenten, äh, Studierende|language=de|newspaper=Sueddeutsche.de|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/bildung/gleichberechtigung-im-studium-studenten-aeh-aeh-studierende-1.2355340}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this approach introduces an element of ambiguity, because gerund nouns more precisely denote one currently engaged in the activity, rather than one who routinely engages in it as their primary occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Osel, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], some writers have pointed to sexism inherent in the structure of written characters. For example, the character for man is linked to those for positive qualities like courage and effect while the character for wife is composed of a female part and a broom, considered of low worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4316075|title=Sexism in the Chinese Language|first=Dali|last=Tan|date=1 January 1990|journal=[[NWSA Journal]]|volume=2|issue=4|pages=635–639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender-specific pejorative terms ===

Gender-specific pejorative terms intimidate or harm another person because of their gender. Sexism can be expressed in language with negative gender-oriented implications,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.anti-bullyingalliance.org.uk/media/7480/sst-guidance-quick-guide.pdf|title=Guidance for schools on preventing and responding to sexist, sexual and transphobic bullying: quick guide|date=January 1, 2009|publisher=Great Britain Department for Children, Schools and Families|oclc=663427461|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716122907/http://www.anti-bullyingalliance.org.uk/media/7480/sst-guidance-quick-guide.pdf|archive-date=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Disdain|condescension]]. For example, one may refer to a female as a "girl" rather than a "woman", implying that they are subordinate or not fully mature. Other examples include obscene language. &lt;!-- Do not list swear words here. --&gt;Some words are offensive to transgender people, including "tranny", "she-male", or "he-she". Intentional [[Transphobia#Misgendering and exclusion|misgendering]] (assigning the wrong gender to someone) and the pronoun "it" are also considered pejorative.&lt;ref name="Mills College Report on Inclusion of Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming Students Best Practices, Assessment and Recommendations"&gt;Mills College Transgender Best Practices Taskforce &amp; Gender Identity and Expression Sub-Committee of the Diversity and Social Justice Committee.

Occupational sexism refers to [[discrimination|discriminatory]] practices, statements or actions, based on a person's [[sex]], occurring in the workplace. One form of occupational sexism is [[wage discrimination]]. In 2008, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) found that while female employment rates have expanded and gender employment and wage gaps have narrowed nearly everywhere, on average women still have 20% less chance to have a job and are paid 17% less than men.&lt;ref name="oecd1"/&gt; The report stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;[In] many countries, labour market discrimination—i.e. the unequal treatment of equally productive individuals only because they belong to a specific group—is still a crucial factor inflating disparities in employment and the quality of job opportunities [...] Evidence presented in this edition of the ''Employment Outlook'' suggests that about 8{{nbsp}}percent of the variation in gender employment gaps and 30 percent of the variation in gender wage gaps across OECD countries can be explained by discriminatory practices in the labor market.&lt;ref name="oecd1"&gt;[[OECD]]. [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/8/19/40937574.pdf ''OECD Employment Outlook—2008 Edition Summary in English''.] OECD, Paris, 2008, p. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oecd2"&gt;[[OECD]].

Chapter 3: The Price of Prejudice: Labour Market Discrimination on the Grounds of Gender and Ethnicity''.] OECD, Paris, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It also found that although almost all OECD countries, including the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts About Compensation Discrimination|author=The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/fs-epa.html|access-date=April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; have established anti-discrimination laws, these laws are difficult to enforce.&lt;ref name="oecd1"/&gt;

Women who enter predominantly male work groups can experience the negative consequences of [[tokenism]]: performance pressures, social isolation, and role encapsulation.&lt;ref name=Yoder&gt;{{cite journal |first=Janice D. |last=Yoder |title=Rethinking Tokenism: Looking beyond Numbers |journal=[[Gender and Society]] |volume=5 |issue=2 |year=1991 |pages=178–192 |doi=10.1177/089124391005002003 |s2cid=144717322 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Split from ":0"--&gt; Tokenism could be used to camouflage sexism, to preserve male workers' advantage in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Yoder/&gt;&lt;!-- Split from ":0"--&gt; No link exists between the proportion of women working in an organization/company and the improvement of their working conditions.

In the ''[[World Values Survey]]'' of 2005, responders were asked if they thought wage work should be restricted to men only. In Iceland, the percentage that agreed was 3.6%, whereas in Egypt it was 94.9%.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicole Fortin|Fortin, Nicole]], "Gender Role Attitudes and the Labour Market Outcomes of Women Across OECD Countries", ''[[Oxford Review of Economic Policy]]'', 2005, 21, 416–438.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gap in hiring ===

Research has repeatedly shown that mothers in the United States are less likely to be hired than equally qualified fathers and if hired, receive a lower salary than male applicants with children.&lt;ref name="Folbre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cahn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Young" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Correll" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cornell" /&gt;{{Excessive citations inline|date=December 2021}}

One study found that female applicants were favored; however, its results have been met with skepticism from other researchers, since it contradicts most other studies on the issue. Joan C. Williams, a distinguished professor at the University of California's Hastings College of Law, raised issues with its methodology, pointing out that the fictional female candidates it used were unusually well-qualified. Studies using more moderately qualified graduate students have found that male students are much more likely to be hired, offered better salaries, and offered mentorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=National hiring experiments reveal 2:1 faculty preference for women on STEM tenure track|author=Wendy M.

In Europe, studies based on field experiments in the labor market, provide evidence for no severe levels of discrimination based on female gender.

=== Earnings gap ===

{{Main|Gender pay gap}}
[[File: EU 27 Gender Pay Gap 2014.png|thumb|upright=1.35|alt=Bar graph showing the gender pay gap in European countries|Gender pay gap in average gross hourly earnings according to [[Eurostat]] 2014&lt;ref name="EC stats" /&gt;]]

Studies have concluded that on average women earn lower wages than men worldwide. Some people argue that this results from widespread gender discrimination in the workplace. Others argue that the wage gap results from different choices by men and women, such as women placing more value than men on having children, and men being more likely than women to choose careers in high paying fields such as business, engineering, and technology.

[[Eurostat]] found a persistent, average gender pay gap of 27.5% in the 27 [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="EC stats"&gt;[[European Commission]]. [http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/gender-pay-gap/situation-europe/index_en.htm ''The situation in the EU''.] Retrieved on August 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the OECD found that female full-time employees earned 27% less than their male counterparts in OECD countries in 2009.&lt;ref name="oecd1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oecd2"/&gt;

In the United States, the female-to-male earnings ratio was 0.77 in 2009; female full-time, year-round (FTYR) workers earned 77% as much as male FTYR workers. Women's earnings relative to men's fell from 1960 to 1980 (56.7–54.2%), rose rapidly from 1980 to 1990 (54.2–67.6%), leveled off from 1990 to 2000 (67.6–71.2%) and rose from 2000 to 2009 (71.2–77.0%).&lt;ref name="census 2009"&gt;U.S. Census Bureau.

[http://www.iwpr.org/publications/pubs/the-gender-wage-gap-2009 ''The Gender Wage Gap: 2009''.] Retrieved March 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As of the late 2010s, it has decreased back to around 1990 to 2000 levels (68.6-71.1%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dqydj.com/2018-income-by-sex/|title = Male Income Percentile and Female Income Percentile Calculator in 2018|date = December 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dqydj.com/income-by-sex/|title = Income by Sex: Average, Median, 1%, and Calculator – DQYDJ|date = October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the first [[Equal Pay Act of 1963|Equal Pay Act]] was passed in 1963, female full-time workers earned 48.9% as much as male full-time workers.&lt;ref name="census 2009"/&gt;

Research conducted in Czechia and Slovakia shows that, even after the governments passed anti-discrimination legislation, two thirds of the gender gap in wages remained unexplained and segregation continued to "represent a major source of the gap".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Štěpán |last=Jurajda |year=2005 |title=Gender Segregation and Wage Gap: An East-West Comparison |journal=[[Journal of the European Economic Association]] |volume=3 |issue=2–3 |pages=598–607 |doi=10.1162/jeea.2005.3.2-3.598 |s2cid=54763679 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gender gap can also vary across-occupation and within occupation. In Taiwan, for example, studies show how the bulk of gender wage discrepancies occur within-occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Joseph E. Jr. |last1=Zveglich |first2=Yana van der Meulen |last2=Rodgers |title=Occupational Segregation and the Gender Wage Gap in a Dynamic East Asian Economy |journal=[[Southern Economic Journal]] |volume=70 |issue=4 |year=2004 |pages=850–875 |doi=10.2307/4135276 |jstor=4135276 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, research shows that the gender wage gap is distributed unevenly across income levels, and that it mainly occurs at the lower end of income distribution.&lt;ref name="Gerry-2004"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Christopher J. |last1=Gerry |first2=Byung-Yeon |last2=Kim |first3=Carmen A. |last3=Li |title=The Gender Wage Gap and Wage Arrears in Russia: Evidence from the RLMS |journal=[[Journal of Population Economics]] |volume=17 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=267–288 |doi=10.1007/s00148-003-0160-3 |s2cid=7435706 |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/17553/1/17553.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The research also found that "wage arrears and payment in-kind attenuated wage discrimination, particularly amongst the lowest paid workers, suggesting that Russian enterprise managers assigned lowest importance to equity considerations when allocating these forms of payment".&lt;ref name="Gerry-2004" /&gt;

The gender pay gap has been attributed to differences in personal and workplace characteristics between men and women (such as education, hours worked and occupation), innate behavioral and biological differences between men and women and discrimination in the labor market (such as gender stereotypes and customer and employer bias).

Wage discrimination is theorized as contradicting the economic concept of [[supply and demand]], which states that if a good or service (in this case, labor) is in demand and has value it will find its price in the market. If a worker offered equal value for less pay, supply and demand would indicate a greater demand for lower-paid workers. If a business hired lower-wage workers for the same work, it would lower its costs and enjoy a [[competitive advantage]]. According to supply and demand, if women offered equal value demand (and wages) should rise since they offer a better price (lower wages) for their service than men do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swifteconomics.com/2009/09/21/lies-damned-lies-and-statistics-the-wage-gap/ |title=Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics: The Wage Gap |publisher=Swift Economics |date=September 21, 2009 |access-date=July 20, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705013033/http://www.swifteconomics.com/2009/09/21/lies-damned-lies-and-statistics-the-wage-gap |archive-date=July 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== {{anchor|Proposed Explanations}} Causes for wage discrimination ====

The non-adjusted gender pay gap (the difference without taking into account differences in working hours, occupations, education and work experience) is not itself a measure of discrimination. Rather, it combines differences in the average pay of women and men to serve as a barometer of comparison. Differences in pay are caused by:

* occupational segregation (with more men in higher paid industries and women in lower paid industries), 
* vertical segregation (fewer women in senior, and hence better paying positions), 
* ineffective equal pay legislation, 
* women's overall paid working hours, and 
* barriers to entry into the labor market (such as education level and single parenting rate).&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Leythienne |first1=Denis |last2=Ronkowski |first2=Piotr |title=A decomposition of the unadjusted gender pay gap using Structure of Earnings Survey data |url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3888793/8979317/KS-TC-18-003-EN-N.pdf |access-date=24 September 2023 |website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some variables that help explain the non-adjusted gender pay gap include economic activity, working time, and job tenure.&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt; Gender-specific factors, including gender differences in qualifications and discrimination, overall wage structure, and the differences in remuneration across industry sectors all influence the gender pay gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blau|first1=Francine D.|last2=Kahn|first2=Lawrence M.|date=November 2000|title=Gender Differences in Pay|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=14|issue=4|pages=75–100|doi=10.1257/jep.14.4.75|s2cid=55685704|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eurostat]] estimated in 2016 that after allowing for average characteristics of men and women, women still earn 11.5% less than men.

=== Glass ceiling effect ===

{{Main|Glass ceiling}}

"The popular notion of glass ceiling effects implies that gender (or other) disadvantages are stronger at the top of the hierarchy than at lower levels and that these disadvantages become worse later in a person's career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=David A. |last1=Cotter |first2=Joan M. |last2=Hermsen |first3=Seth |last3=Ovadia |first4=Reeve |last4=Vanneman |year=2001 |title=The Glass Ceiling Effect |journal=[[Social Forces]] |volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=655–681 |doi=10.1353/sof.2001.0091 |s2cid=145245044 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, women account for 52% of the overall labor force, but make up only three percent of corporate CEOs and top executives.&lt;ref name="David A 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=David A. |last1=Matsa |first2=Amalia R. |last2=Miller |year=2011 |title=Chipping away at the Glass Ceiling: Gender Spillovers in Corporate Leadership |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |series=Papers and Proceedings |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=635–639 |doi=10.1257/aer.101.3.635 |s2cid=154536609 |url=http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/working_papers/2011/RAND_WR842.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers see the root cause of this situation in the tacit discrimination based on gender, conducted by current top executives and corporate directors (primarily male), and "the historic absence of women in top positions", which "may lead to [[hysteresis]], preventing women from accessing powerful, male-dominated professional networks, or same-sex mentors".&lt;ref name="David A 2011" /&gt; The glass ceiling effect is noted as being especially persistent for women of color. According to a report, "women of colour perceive a 'concrete ceiling' and not simply a glass ceiling".&lt;ref name="David A 2011" /&gt;

In the economics profession, it has been observed that women are more inclined than men to dedicate their time to teaching and service. Since continuous research work is crucial for promotion, "the cumulative effect of small, contemporaneous differences in research orientation could generate the observed significant gender difference in promotion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=John M. |last1=McDowell | first2=Larry D. Jr. |last2=Singell |first3=James P. |last3=Ziliak |year=1999 |title=Cracks in the Glass Ceiling: Gender and Promotion in the Economics Profession |journal=American Economic Review |volume=89 |issue=2 |series=Papers and Proceedings |pages=392–396 |jstor=117142 |doi=10.1257/aer.89.2.392 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the high-tech industry, research shows that, regardless of the intra-firm changes, "extra-organizational pressures will likely contribute to continued gender stratification as firms upgrade, leading to the potential masculinization of skilled high-tech work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Steven C. |last=McKay |year=2006 |title=Hard Drives and Glass Ceilings: Gender Stratification in High-Tech Production |journal=[[Gender and Society]] |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=207–235 |doi=10.1177/0891243205285371 |s2cid=154793796 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations asserts that "progress in bringing women into leadership and decision making positions around the world remains far too slow".&lt;ref name="UN-IWD2006"&gt;{{cite web|title=Women still struggle to break through glass ceiling in government, business, academia|publisher=United Nations|date=March 8, 2006|url=https://www.un.org/events/women/iwd/2006/PressReleaseIWD8March.pdf|access-date=July 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Potential remedies ====

Research by David Matsa and Amalia Miller suggests that a remedy to the glass ceiling could be increasing the number of women on corporate boards, which could lead to increases in the number of women working in top management positions.&lt;ref name="David A 2011"/&gt; The same research suggests that this could also result in a "feedback cycle in which the presence of more female managers increases the qualified pool of potential female board members (for the companies they manage, as well as other companies), leading to greater female board membership and then further increases in female executives".&lt;ref name="UN-IWD2006" /&gt;

=== Weight-based sexism ===

A 2009 study found that being overweight harms women's career advancement, but presents no barrier for men. [[Overweight]] women were significantly underrepresented among company bosses, making up between five and 22% of female CEOs. However, the proportion of overweight male CEOs was between 45% and 61%, over-representing overweight men. On the other hand, approximately five percent of CEOs were obese among both genders. The author of the study stated that the results suggest that "the '[[glass ceiling]] effect' on women's advancement may reflect not only general negative stereotypes about the competencies of women but also weight bias that results in the application of stricter appearance standards to women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1108/02610150910937916 | volume=28 | title=Weight discrimination and the glass ceiling effect among top US CEOs | year=2009 | journal=[[Equal Opportunities International]] | pages=179–196 | last1 = Roehling | first1 = Patricia V.| issue=2 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moult, Julie.

In August 1995, Kimberly Nixon filed a complaint with the [[British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal]] against Vancouver Rape Relief &amp; Women's Shelter. Nixon, a [[trans woman]], had been interested in volunteering as a counsellor with the shelter. When the shelter learned that she was [[transsexual]], they told Nixon that she would not be allowed to volunteer with the organization. Nixon argued that this constituted illegal discrimination under Section 41 of the British Columbia ''[[Human Rights Code (British Columbia)|Human Rights Code]]''. Vancouver Rape Relief countered that individuals are shaped by the [[socialization]] and experiences of their formative years, and that Nixon had been socialized as a male growing up, and that, therefore, Nixon would not be able to provide sufficiently effective counselling to the female born women that the shelter served. Nixon took her case to the Supreme Court of Canada, which refused to hear the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thetyee.ca/News/2007/02/03/Nixon/|title=Transsexual Loses Fight with Women's Shelter |last=Rupp|first=Shannon|date=2007-02-03|website=[[The Tyee]]|language=en|access-date=June 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectification ==

[[File:Menu.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Illustration of a woman splayed across a wine menu |Example of [[sexual objectification]] of women on a wine menu]]

In [[social philosophy]], [[objectification]] is the act of treating a person as an object or thing.

# '''Instrumentality''': treating the object as a [[tool]] for another's purposes: "The objectifier treats the object as a tool of his or her purposes."
# '''Denial of [[autonomy]]''': treating the object as lacking in autonomy or [[self-determination]]: "The objectifier treats the object as lacking in autonomy and self-determination."
# '''Inertness''': treating the object as lacking in [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] or [[Action (philosophy)|activity]]: "The objectifier treats the object as lacking in agency, and perhaps also in activity."
# '''[[Fungibility]]''': treating the object as interchangeable with other objects: "The objectifier treats the object as interchangeable (a) with other objects of the same type, and/or (b) with objects of other types."
# '''Violability''': treating the object as lacking in boundary integrity and violable: "The objectifier treats the object as lacking in boundary integrity, as something that it is permissible to break up, smash, break into."
# '''[[Ownership]]''': treating the object as if it can be owned, bought, or sold: "The objectifier treats the object as something that is owned by another, can be bought or sold, etc."
# '''Denial of [[subjectivity]]''': treating the object as if there is no need for concern for its experiences or feelings: "The objectifier treats the object as something whose experience and feelings (if any) need not be taken into account."
[[Rae Helen Langton]], in ''Sexual Solipsism: Philosophical Essays on Pornography and Objectification'', proposed three more properties to be added to Nussbaum's list:&lt;ref name="Stanfordfeminism-objectification" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Langdon228–229"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rae Langton|author-link1=Rae Helen Langton|title=Sexual Solipsism: Philosophical Essays on Pornography and Objectification, 1st Edition|date=February 15, 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-955145-3|pages=228–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Reduction to Body''': the treatment of a person as identified with their body, or body parts;
# '''Reduction to Appearance''': the treatment of a person primarily in terms of how they look, or how they appear to the senses;
# '''Silencing''': the treatment of a person as if they are silent, lacking the capacity to speak.
According to objectification theory, objectification can have important repercussions on women, particularly young women, as it can negatively impact their psychological health and lead to the development of mental disorders, such as [[Major depressive disorder|unipolar depression]], [[sexual dysfunction]], and [[eating disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="FredricksonRoberts1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fredrickson|first1=Barbara L.|last2=Roberts|first2=Tomi-Ann|title=Objectification Theory |journal=[[Psychology of Women Quarterly]]|volume=21|issue=2|year=1997|pages=173–206|issn=0361-6843|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00108.x|s2cid=145272074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While advertising used to portray women and men in obviously stereotypical roles (e.g., as a housewife, breadwinner), in modern advertisements, they are no longer solely confined to their traditional roles. However, advertising today still stereotypes men and women, albeit in more subtle ways, including by sexually objectifying them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Zimmerman | first1=Amanda | last2=Dahlberg | first2=John | year=2008 | title=The sexual objectification of women in advertising: A contemporary cultural perspective | url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4682b9942712c00d48f819e9039023c9bae4ede6| journal=[[Journal of Advertising Research]] | volume=48 | issue=1| pages=71–79 | doi=10.2501/s0021849908080094| s2cid=30977582 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are most often targets of sexism in advertising.{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed|date=April 2018}} When in advertisements with men they are often shorter and put in the background of images, shown in more "feminine" poses, and generally present a higher degree of "body display".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Zotos|first1=Yorgos|last2=Tsichla|first2=Eirini|date=October 2014|title=Snapshots of Men and Women in Interaction: An Investigation of Stereotypes in Print Advertisement Relationship Portrayals|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267842958|journal=Journal of Euromarketing|volume=23|issue=3|pages=35–58|via=ResearchGate|doi=10.9768/0023.03.035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pornography ===

{{See also|Feminist views on pornography}}

Anti-pornography feminist [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argues that [[pornography]] contributes to sexism by objectifying women and portraying them in submissive roles.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, Catharine (1987). ''Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law''. Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]]. p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; MacKinnon, along with [[Andrea Dworkin]], argues that pornography reduces women to mere tools, and is a form of sex discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Papadaki|first=Evangelia|title=Feminist Perspectives on Objectification|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/feminism-objectification/|encyclopedia=The [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|access-date=December 1, 2013|date=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two scholars highlight the link between objectification and pornography by stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We define pornography as the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures and words that also includes (i) women are presented dehumanized as sexual objects, things, or commodities; or (ii) women are presented as sexual objects who enjoy humiliation or pain; or (iii) women are presented as sexual objects experiencing sexual pleasure in rape, incest or other sexual assault; or (iv) women are presented as sexual objects tied up, cut up or mutilated or bruised or physically hurt; or (v) women are presented in postures or positions of sexual submission, servility, or display; or (vi) women's body parts—including but not limited to vaginas, breasts, or buttocks—are exhibited such that women are reduced to those parts; or (vii) women are presented being penetrated by objects or animals; or (viii) women are presented in scenarios of degradation, humiliation, injury, torture, shown as filthy or inferior, bleeding, bruised, or hurt in a context that makes these conditions sexual."&lt;ref name="DworkinMacKinnon1988"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrea Dworkin|author-link1=Andrea Dworkin|author2=Catharine A.

[[Robin Morgan]] and Catharine MacKinnon suggest that certain types of pornography also contribute to [[violence against women]] by eroticizing scenes in which women are dominated, coerced, humiliated or [[sexually assault]]ed.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Robin. (1974). "Theory and Practice: Pornography and Rape". In: ''Going Too Far: The Personal Chronicle of a Feminist''. (1977). [[Random House]]. 333 p. {{ISBN|0-394-48227-1}}.

Some people opposed to pornography, including MacKinnon, charge that the production of pornography entails physical, psychological, and economic [[coercion]] of the women who perform and model in it.&lt;ref name="stanford-shrage"&gt;Shrage, Laurie.

"Sex forced on real women so that it can be sold at a profit to be forced on other real women; women's bodies trussed and maimed and raped and made into things to be hurt and obtained and accessed, and this presented as the nature of women; the coercion that is visible and the coercion that has become invisible—this and more grounds the feminist concern with pornography"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{Cite episode| title=A Conversation With Catherine MacKinnon (transcript)| series=[[Think Tank with Ben Wattenberg|Think Tank]]|network= [[PBS]]| access-date=September 1, 2009| year=1995| url=https://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript215.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of pornography charge that it presents a distorted image of sexual relations and reinforces sexual myths; it shows women as continually available and willing to engage in sex at any time, with any person, on their terms, responding positively to any requests.

MacKinnon writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Pornography affects people's belief in rape myths. So for example if a woman says "I didn't consent" and people have been viewing pornography, they believe rape myths and believe the woman did consent no matter what she said. That when she said no, she meant yes. When she said she didn't want to, that meant more beer. When she said she would prefer to go home, that means she's a lesbian who needs to be given a good corrective experience. Pornography promotes these rape myths and desensitizes people to violence against women so that you need more violence to become sexually aroused if you're a pornography consumer. This is very well documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/apr/12/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Stuart | last=Jeffries | title=Stuart Jeffries talks to leading feminist Catharine MacKinnon | date=April 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Defenders of pornography and anti-censorship activists (including [[sex-positive feminists]]) argue that pornography does not seriously impact a mentally healthy individual, since the viewer can distinguish between fantasy and reality.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}} They contend that men and women are objectified in pornography particularly [[Sadomasochism|sadistic or masochistic]] pornography, in which men are objectified and sexually used by women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seejane.org/downloads/Hatton_Trautner_Sexuality_and_Culture.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123115712/http://www.seejane.org/downloads/Hatton_Trautner_Sexuality_and_Culture.pdf|date=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prostitution ===

[[Prostitution]] is the business or practice of engaging in [[human sexual activity|sexual relations]] for [[payment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=Prostitution—Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prostitution|dictionary=Merriam-Webster|access-date=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prostitution Law &amp; Legal Definition|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/prostitution|publisher=US Legal|access-date=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex workers are often objectified and are seen as existing only to serve clients, thus calling their sense of agency into question. There is a prevailing notion that because they sell sex professionally, prostitutes automatically consent to all sexual contact.&lt;ref name="sullivan"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Rape, Prostitution and Consent | author=Sullivan, Barbara | journal=[[Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology]] | year=2007 | volume=40 | issue=2 | pages=127–142 | quote=In common law jurisdictions like the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, some of the evidentiary jurisprudence clearly linked chastity with veracity. So women who were or had been sex workers, those who were 'rumoured' to be prostitutes or who were simply promiscuous and behaving 'like a prostitute' lacked credibility as complainants, which made it difficult for the prosecution to prove the sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt. Women in any of these categories were seen at law as 'commonly available' to men, as always consenting to sexual activity and thus, as not able to be raped. Men accused of sexual assault were therefore able to use evidence of prostitution to defend themselves, to undermine the credibility of rape complainants and to successfully avoid conviction. | doi=10.1375/acri.40.2.127| s2cid=145263451 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, sex workers face higher [[violence against prostitutes|rates of violence]] and sexual assault. This is often dismissed, ignored and not taken seriously by authorities.&lt;ref name="sullivan" /&gt;

In many countries, prostitution is dominated by brothels or pimps, who often claim ownership over sex workers. This sense of ownership furthers the concept that sex workers are void of agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://walnet.org/csis/papers/redefining.html |title=Redefining Prostitution as Sex Work on the International Agenda |website=walnet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is literally the case in instances of [[sexual slavery]].

Various authors have argued that female prostitution is based on male sexism that condones the idea that unwanted sex with a woman is acceptable, that men's desires must be satisfied, and that women are coerced into and exist to serve men sexually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.soc.iastate.edu/sapp/Prostitution.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903143328/http://www.soc.iastate.edu/sapp/Prostitution.pdf | archive-date=September 3, 2006 | title=Readings on Prostitution }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jan/18/ukcrime.prisonsandprobation|title=Julie Bindel: Eradicate the oldest oppression—UK news—The Guardian|author=Julie Bindel|newspaper=the Guardian|date=January 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/10/endingatradeinmisery|title=Ending a trade in misery|author=Julie Bindel|newspaper=the Guardian|date=September 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mlFgjEBYWYC |title=The Industrial Vagina |via=[[Google Books]] |access-date=2015-03-31|isbn=978-0-203-69830-3 |last1=Jeffreys |first1=Sheila |date=November 11, 2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Women's Lobby]] condemned prostitution as "an intolerable form of male violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Women's Lobby: Prostitution in Europe: 60 Years of Reluctance|url=http://www.womenslobby.eu/spip.php?article472|website=womenslobby.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carole Pateman]] writes that:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Prostitution is the use of a woman's body by a man for his own satisfaction. There is no desire or satisfaction on the part of the prostitute. Prostitution is not mutual, pleasurable exchange of the use of bodies, but the unilateral use of a woman's body by a man in exchange for money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jH2KPvZF1L0C |title=The Sexual Contract |via=[[Google Books]] |access-date=March 31, 2015|isbn=978-0-8047-1477-8 |last1=Pateman |first1=Carole |author-link=Carole Pateman|year=1988 |publisher=Stanford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Media portrayals ===

{{see also|Misogyny in rap music|Sexism in heavy metal music}}

Some scholars believe that media portrayals of demographic groups can both maintain and disrupt attitudes and behaviors toward those groups.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, E., &amp; Henderson Daniel, J. (Eds.).

For example, a study of African American women found they feel that media portrayals of themselves often reinforce stereotypes of this group as overly sexual and idealize images of lighter-skinned, thinner African American women (images African American women describe as objectifying).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Watson | first1=L.

In an attempt to study the effect of [[media consumption]] on males, Samantha and Bridges found an effect on body shame, though not through self-objectification as it was found in comparable studies of women. The authors conclude that the current measures of objectification were designed for women and do not measure men accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Daniel | first1=Samantha | last2=Bridges | first2=Sara K. | year=2010 | title=The drive for muscularity in men: Media influences and objectification theory | journal=[[Body Image (journal)|Body Image]] | volume=7 | issue=1| pages=32–38 | doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2009.08.003| pmid=19815476 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found a negative effect on eating attitudes and body satisfaction of consumption of beauty and fitness magazines for women and men respectively but again with different mechanisms, namely self-objectification for women and internalization for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Magazine exposure: Internalization, self-objectification, eating attitudes, and body satisfaction in male and female university students |last1=Morry |first1=Marian M. |last2=Staska |first2=Sandra L. |journal=[[Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science]] |volume=33 |issue=4 |year=2001 |pages=269–279 |doi=10.1037/h0087148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexist jokes ===

[[Frederick T. Attenborough|Frederick Attenborough]] argues that sexist jokes can be a form of sexual objectification, which reduce the butt of the joke to an object.

== Gender identity discrimination ==

Gender discrimination is discrimination based on actual or perceived [[gender identity]].&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2021}} Gender identity is "the gender-related identity, appearance, or mannerisms or other gender-related characteristics of an individual, with or without regard to the individual's designated sex at birth".&lt;ref name="fas.org"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Feder, Jody |author2=Cynthia Brougher |name-list-style=amp |title=Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Discrimination in Employment: A Legal Analysis of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) |date=July 15, 2013 |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40934.pdf |publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]] |access-date=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2021}} Gender discrimination is theoretically different from sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kimmel |first=Michael S. |year=2004 |title=The Gendered Society |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-514975-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/genderedsociety00kimm_0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2021}} Whereas sexism is prejudice based on biological sex, gender discrimination specifically addresses discrimination towards gender identities, including [[third gender]], [[genderqueer]], and other [[Non-binary gender|non-binary]] identified people.&lt;ref name="Macklem"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2021}} It is especially attributed to how people are treated in the workplace,&lt;ref name="Lenhart"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2021}} and banning discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression has emerged as a subject of contention in the American legal system.&lt;ref name="hrc.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrc.org/laws-and-legislation/federal-legislation/employment-non-discrimination-act |title=Employment Non-Discrimination Act |website=Human Rights Campaign |date=March 9, 2015 |access-date=March 31, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520071809/http://www.hrc.org/laws-and-legislation/federal-legislation/employment-non-discrimination-act |archive-date=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a recent report by the [[Congressional Research Service]], "although the majority of federal courts to consider the issue have concluded that discrimination on the basis of gender identity is not sex discrimination, there have been several courts that have reached the opposite conclusion".&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt; Hurst states that "[c]ourts often confuse sex, gender and sexual orientation, and confuse them in a way that results in denying the rights not only of gays and lesbians, but also of those who do not present themselves or act in a manner traditionally expected of their sex".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hurst |first=C. |title=Social Inequality: Forms, Causes, and Consequences |edition=Sixth |location=Boston |publisher=[[Allyn and Bacon|Pearson/Allyn and Bacon]] |year=2007 |pages=131, 139–142 |isbn=978-0-205-48436-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oppositional sexism ===

Oppositional sexism is a term coined by [[Transfeminism|transfeminist]] author [[Julia Serano]], who defined oppositional sexism as "the belief that male and female are rigid, mutually exclusive categories".&lt;ref name="Serano-2007"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity|last=Serano|first=Julia|author-link=Julia Serano|publisher=[[Seal Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-786-74791-7|location=Emeryville, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oppositional sexism plays a vital role in a number of [[social norm]]s, such as [[cissexism]], [[heteronormativity]], and traditional sexism.

Oppositional sexism normalizes masculine expression in males and feminine expression in females while simultaneously demonizing femininity in males and masculinity in females. This concept plays a crucial role in supporting cissexism, the social norm that views cisgender people as both natural and privileged as opposed to transgender people.&lt;ref name="SAGE Publications-2015"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Counseling Across Cultures|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2015|isbn=978-1-4522-1752-9|location=United States of America|edition=7th|editor2-first=Walter|editor-last=Pedersen|editor-first=Paul|editor2-last=Lonner|editor3-last=Draguns|editor3-first=Juris|editor4-last=Trimble|editor4-first=Joseph|editor5-last=Scharrón-del Río|editor5-first=María}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of having two, opposite genders is tied to sexuality through what [[Gender studies|gender theorist]] [[Judith Butler]] calls a "compulsory practice of heterosexuality".&lt;ref name="SAGE Publications-2015" /&gt; Because oppositional sexism is tied to heteronormativity in this way, non-heterosexuals are seen as breaking gender norms.&lt;ref name="SAGE Publications-2015" /&gt;

The concept of opposite genders sets a "dangerous precedent", according to Serano, where "if men are big then women must be small; and if men are strong then women must be weak".&lt;ref name="Serano-2007" /&gt; The [[gender binary]] and oppositional norms work together to support "traditional sexism", the belief that femininity is inferior to and serves masculinity.&lt;ref name="SAGE Publications-2015" /&gt;

Serano states that oppositional sexism works in tandem with "traditional sexism". This ensures that "those who are masculine have power over those who are feminine, and that only those that are born male will be seen as authentically masculine."&lt;ref name="Serano-2007" /&gt;

The 2008–09 National Transgender Discrimination Survey (NTDS)—a U.S. study by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in collaboration with the National Black Justice Coalition that was, at its time, the most extensive survey of transgender discrimination—showed that Black [[transgender people in the United States]] suffer "the combination of anti-transgender bias and persistent, structural and individual racism" and that "black transgender people live in extreme poverty that is more than twice the rate for transgender people of all races (15%), four times the general Black population rate (9%) and over eight times the general US population rate (4%)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Injustice at every turn: A look at Black respondents in the National Transgender Discrimination Survey|url=http://nbjc.org/sites/default/files/trans-adjustment-web.pdf|website=[[National Black Justice Coalition]]|access-date=20 January 2018|archive-date=February 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190220101059/http://nbjc.org/sites/default/files/trans-adjustment-web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further discrimination is faced by gender nonconforming individuals, whether transitioning or not, because of displacement from societally acceptable gender binaries and visible stigmatization. According to the NTDS, transgender gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals face between eight percent and 15% higher rates of self and social discrimination and violence than binary transgender individuals. Lisa R. Miller and Eric Anthony Grollman found in their 2015 study that "gender nonconformity may heighten trans people's exposure to discrimination and health-harming behaviors. Gender nonconforming trans adults reported more events of major and everyday transphobic discrimination than their gender conforming counterparts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Miller | first1=Lisa R. | last2=Grollman | first2=Eric Anthony | year=2015 | title=The Social Costs of Gender Nonconformity for Transgender Adults: Implications for Discrimination and Health | journal=[[Sociological Forum]] | volume=30 | issue=3| pages=809–831 | doi=10.1111/socf.12193| pmid=27708501 | pmc=5044929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study conducted in collaboration with the League of United Latin American Citizens, Latino/a transgender people who were non-citizens were most vulnerable to harassment, abuse and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://endtransdiscrimination.org/report.html |title=the Survey |publisher=End Trans Discrimination |access-date=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the exact rates are widely disputed, there is a large body of cross-cultural evidence that [[domestic violence]] is mostly committed by men against women.&lt;ref name=Dobash1992&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dobash | first1=R.

Domestic violence is tolerated and even legally accepted in many parts of the world. For instance, in 2010, the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE)'s Supreme Court ruled that a man has the right to discipline his wife and children physically if he does not leave visible marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-10-19/world/uae.court.ruling_1_islamic-law-sharia-law-ruling?_s=PM:WORLD |title=Court in UAE says beating wife, child OK if no marks are left |work=CNN|access-date=July 20, 2013 |date=October 19, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325143850/http://articles.cnn.com/2010-10-19/world/uae.court.ruling_1_islamic-law-sharia-law-ruling?_s=PM%3AWORLD |archive-date=March 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[Equality Now]] drew attention to a section of the Penal Code of Northern Nigeria, titled ''Correction of Child, Pupil, Servant or Wife'' which reads: "(1) Nothing is an offence which does not amount to the infliction of grievous hurt upon any persons which is done:&amp;nbsp;(...) (d) by a husband for the purpose of correcting his wife, such husband and wife being subject to any native law or custom in which such correction is recognized as lawful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equalitynow.org/law/the_penal_code_of_northern_nigeria |title=The Penal Code of Northern Nigeria |publisher=Equalitynow.org |date=February 6, 2015 |access-date=March 31, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123608/http://www.equalitynow.org/law/the_penal_code_of_northern_nigeria |archive-date=April 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Honor killings]] are another form of domestic violence practiced in several parts of the world, and their victims are predominantly women.&lt;ref name=Maris2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maris|first=Cees|author2=Sawitri Saharso |title=Honour Killing: A Case for Cultural Defense?|journal=Pluralism and Law: Proceedings of the 20th IVR World Congress, Amsterdam, 2001|year=2001|volume=3|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Honor killings can occur because of refusal to enter into an arranged marriage, maintaining a relationship relatives disapprove of, extramarital sex, becoming the victim of rape, dress seen as inappropriate, or homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml#h3|title=BBC—Ethics—Honour crimes|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/13/world/europe/turkey-gay-killing | work=CNN | title=Shocking gay honor killing inspires movie—CNN.com | date=January 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/02/23/arizona.iraqi.father/index.html | work=CNN | title=Iraqi immigrant convicted in Arizona 'honor killing' awaits sentence | date=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] states that, "[h]onour crimes, including killing, are one of history's oldest forms of gender-based violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/justice-and-prison-reform/hb_eff_police_responses.pdf|title=Effective police responses to violence against women|website=unodc.org|access-date=December 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the 58th session of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] concerning cultural practices in the family that reflect violence against women:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Special Rapporteur indicated that there had been contradictory decisions with regard to the honour defense in [[Brazil]], and that legislative provisions allowing for partial or complete defense in that context could be found in the penal codes of Argentina, Ecuador, Egypt, Guatemala, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Peru, Syria, Venezuela, and the [[Palestinian National Authority]].&lt;ref name="unhchr"&gt;''Working towards the elimination of crimes against women committed in the name of honour: Report of the Secretary-General''. July 2, 2002. United Nations General Assembly.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Practices such as honor killings and stoning continue to be supported by mainstream politicians and other officials in some countries. In Pakistan, after the 2008 [[Balochistan honour killings]] in which five women were killed by tribesmen of the [[Umrani|Umrani Tribe]] of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], Pakistani federal minister for Postal Services [[Israr Ullah Zehri]] defended the practice:&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4678530.ece |title=Three teenagers buried alive in 'honour killings' |access-date=September 5, 2008 |work=[[Times Online]] | location=London | first=Zahid | last=Hussain | date=September 5, 2008}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; "These are centuries-old traditions, and I will continue to defend them.

[[Dowry deaths]] result from the killing of women who are unable to pay the high dowry price for their marriage. According to [[Amnesty International]], "the ongoing reality of dowry-related violence is an example of what can happen when women are treated as property".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/women-s-rights/violence-against-women/violence-against-women-information|title=Violence Against Women Information|website=Amnesty International USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gendercide and forced sterilization ===

[[Female infanticide]] is the killing of newborn female children, while female [[sex-selective abortion|selective abortion]] is the terminating of a pregnancy based upon the female sex of the fetus.

Sex-selective abortion involves terminating a pregnancy based upon the predicted sex of the baby. The abortion of female fetuses is most common in areas where a culture values male children over females,&lt;ref name="Goodkind" /&gt; such as parts of [[East Asia]] and South Asia (China, India, Korea), the [[Caucasus]] (Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia), and [[Western Balkans]] (Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo).&lt;ref name="Goodkind"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1999|title=Should Prenatal Sex Selection be Restricted?: Ethical Questions and Their Implications for Research and Policy|journal=Population Studies|volume=53|issue=1|pages=49–61|doi=10.1080/00324720308069|jstor=2584811|author=Goodkind, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gettis"&gt;{{cite book |first1=A. |last1=Gettis |first2=J. |last2=Getis |first3=J.

[[Forced sterilization]] and [[forced abortion]] are also forms of gender-based violence.&lt;ref name="eige.europa.eu"/&gt; Forced sterilization was practiced during the first half of the 20th century by many Western countries and there are reports of this practice being currently employed in some countries, such as [[Uzbekistan]] and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17612550 | work=BBC News | title=Uzbekistan's policy of secretly sterilising women | date=April 12, 2012|access-date=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01fjx63|title=BBC Radio 4—Crossing Continents, Forced Sterilisation in Uzbekistan|website=BBC|access-date=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/asia-pacific/china/130409/china-mother-dies-after-forced-sterilization-one-child-policy|title=China 'one-child' policy: Mother of 2 dies after forced sterilization—GlobalPost|website=[[GlobalPost]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/thousands-risk-forced-sterilization-china-2010-04-22 |title=Everything you need to know about human rights |website=Amnesty International |access-date=March 31, 2015 |archive-date=May 29, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529125647/https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/thousands-risk-forced-sterilization-china-2010-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, the [[one child policy]] interacting with the low status of women has been deemed responsible for many abuses, such as female infanticide, sex-selective abortion, abandonment of baby girls, forced abortion, and forced sterilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-34667551|title=Explainer: What was China's one-child policy?|date=29 October 2015|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/06/chinas-barbaric-one-child-policy|title=China's barbaric one-child policy|first=Ma|last=Jian|date=May 6, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several countries in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia made spousal rape illegal before 1970; other European countries and some English-speaking countries outside Europe outlawed it later, mostly in the 1980s and 1990s;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWttAAAAQBAJ&amp;q=The+Routledge+Handbook+of+European+Criminology&amp;pg=PR1|title=The Routledge Handbook of European Criminology|website=Google.ro|access-date=March 31, 2015|isbn=978-1-136-18549-6|last1=Body-Gendrot|author1-link=Sophie Body-Gendrot|first1=Sophie|last2=Hough|first2=Mike|last3=Kerezsi|first3=Klara|last4=Lévy|first4=René|last5=Snacken|first5=Sonja|date=August 15, 2013|publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt; some countries outlawed it in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6225872.stm|title=Thailand passes marital rape bill|date=21 June 2007|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO wrote that: "Marriage is often used to legitimize a range of forms of sexual violence against women.

This practice—legal in many countries—is a form of sexual violence, since the children involved are unable to give or withhold their consent".&lt;ref name="whqlibdoc.who.int"/&gt;

In countries where [[fornication]] or [[adultery]] are illegal, victims of rape can be charged criminally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-21595814|title=BBC News—Maldives girl to get 100 lashes for pre-marital sex|access-date=March 31, 2015|date=February 26, 2013|last1=Lang|first1=Olivia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexism is manifested by the crime of rape targeting women civilians and soldiers, committed by soldiers, combatants or civilians during armed conflict, war or military occupation. This arises from the long tradition of women being seen as sexual booty and from the misogynistic culture of military training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103844570|title=The Nation: The Plight of Women Soldiers|date=May 6, 2009|website=[[NPR.org]]|access-date=March 31, 2015|last1=Benedict|first1=Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3848/|title=Why Soldiers Rape|journal=[[In These Times (publication)|In These Times]]|access-date=March 31, 2015|date=August 13, 2008|archive-date=May 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190518145847/http://inthesetimes.com/article/3848/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marrying girls under 18 years old is rooted in [[gender discrimination]], encouraging premature and continuous child bearing and giving preference to boys' education. Child marriage is also a strategy for economic survival as families marry off their daughters at an early age to reduce their economic burden.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Consequences of child marriage include restricted education and employment prospects, increased risk of domestic violence, [[child sexual abuse]], pregnancy and birth complications, and [[social isolation]].&lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; Early and forced marriage are defined as forms of modern-day slavery by the [[International Labour Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/02/nigeria-child-brides-religion |title=Nigeria's child brides: 'I thought being in labour would never end' |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, a woman or girl who has been raped may be forced to marry her rapist to restore the honor of her family;&lt;ref name="whqlibdoc.who.int"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-17379721|title=BBC News—Morocco protest after raped Amina Filali kills herself|access-date=2015-03-31|date=2012-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[marriage by abduction]], a practice in which a man abducts the woman or girl whom he wishes to marry and rapes her to force the marriage is common in [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/371944.stm | work=BBC News | title=Ethiopia: Revenge of the abducted bride | date=June 18, 1999|access-date=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/69993/ethiopia-surviving-forced-marriage|title=IRIN Africa—Ethiopia: Surviving forced marriage—Ethiopia—Children—Gender Issues|website=IRINnews|date=February 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pathfinder International/Ethiopia (2006) Report on causes and consequences of early marriage in Amhara region.

In several [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) countries the legal testimony of a woman is worth legally half of that of a man (see [[Status of women's testimony in Islam]]).

The criminal justice system in many [[common law countries]] has also been accused of discriminating against women. [[Provocation (legal)|Provocation]] is, in many common law countries, a partial defense to [[murder]], which converts what would have been murder into [[manslaughter]]. It is meant to be applied when a person kills in the "heat of passion" upon being "provoked" by the behavior of the victim. This defense has been criticized as being gendered, favoring men, because of it being used disproportionately in cases of [[adultery]], and other domestic disputes when women are killed by their partners. As a result of the defense exhibiting a strong gender bias, and being a form of legitimization of male violence against women and minimization of the harm caused by violence against women, it has been abolished or restricted in several jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Prod/parlment/publications.nsf/0/F2BA1BFEED2D87EECA257A4800001BD7/$File/briefing%20paper.provocation%20and%20self-defence.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140623052433/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Prod/parlment/publications.nsf/0/F2BA1BFEED2D87EECA257A4800001BD7/%24File/briefing%20paper.provocation%20and%20self-defence.pdf|date=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kate Fitz-Gibbon |title=Provocation in New South Wales: The need for abolition |journal=Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Criminology |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=194–213 |date=August 1, 2012 |doi=10.1177/0004865812443681 |s2cid=144833987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional leniency towards [[crimes of passion]] in Latin American countries has been deemed to have its origin in the view that women are property.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020215152919/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 15, 2002|title=Thousands of Women Killed for Family "Honor"|access-date=June 14, 2015|date=February 12, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Widney Brown, advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, stated that, "[S]o-called crimes of passion have a similar dynamic [to honor killings] in that the women are killed by male family members and the crimes are perceived as excusable or understandable."&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic.com"/&gt; The [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR) has called for "the elimination of discriminatory provisions in the legislation, including mitigating factors for 'crimes of passion{{'}}."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/WRGS/OnePagers/Gender_motivated_killings.pdf | title=Gender-Related Killings of Women and Girls | publisher=[[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, some studies have shown that for identical crimes, men are given harsher sentences than women. Controlling for arrest offense, criminal history, and other pre-charge variables, sentences are over 60% heavier for men. Women are more likely to avoid charges entirely, and to avoid imprisonment if convicted.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/11/men-women-prison-sentence-length-gender-gap_n_1874742.html |title=Men Sentenced To Longer Prison Terms Than Women For Same Crimes, Study Says |work=Huffington Post |access-date=July 20, 2013 |first=Simon |last=McCormack |date=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Michigan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umich.edu/newsandinfo/features/Pages/starr_gender_disparities.aspx|title=Study finds large gender disparities in federal criminal cases|publisher=Law.umich.edu|access-date=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gender disparity varies according to the nature of the case. For example, the gender gap is less pronounced in fraud cases than in drug trafficking and firearms. This disparity occurs in US federal courts, despite guidelines designed to avoid differential sentencing.&lt;ref name="etd.ohiolink.edu"&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Doerner |first=Jill Kathleen |title=Explaining the Gender Gap in Sentencing Outcomes: An Investigation of Differential Treatment in U.S. Federal Courts |date=2009 |degree=Ph.D. |publisher=Bowling Green State University |url=http://etd.ohiolink.edu/view.cgi?acc_num=bgsu1237482038 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630184354/http://etd.ohiolink.edu/view.cgi?acc_num=bgsu1237482038 |archive-date=2013-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The death penalty may also suffer from gender bias. According to Shatz and Shatz, "[t]he present study confirms what earlier studies have shown: that the death penalty is imposed on women relatively infrequently and that it is disproportionately imposed for the killing of women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/studies-gender-bias-death-sentencing|title=Studies: Gender Bias in Death Sentencing|website=Deathpenaltyinfo.org|access-date=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several reasons postulated for the gender criminal justice disparity in the United States. One of the most common is the expectation that women are predominantly care-givers.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Michigan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="etd.ohiolink.edu"/&gt; Other possible reasons include the "girlfriend theory" (whereby women are seen as tools of their boyfriends),&lt;ref name="University of Michigan"/&gt; the theory that female defendants are more likely to cooperate with authorities,&lt;ref name="University of Michigan"/&gt; and that women are often successful at turning their violent crime into victimhood by citing defenses such as [[postpartum depression]] or [[battered wife syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearson|first=Patricia|title=When She Was Bad: How and Why Women Get Away With Murder|year=1998|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-14-024388-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/whenshewasbadhow00pear/page/236 236–239]|url=https://archive.org/details/whenshewasbadhow00pear/page/236}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, none of these theories account for the total disparity,&lt;ref name="University of Michigan"/&gt; and sexism has also been suggested as an underlying cause.&lt;ref&gt;"Unlike race and ethnic discrimination, however, the evidence is more consistent that part of this gap is due to different treatment of offenders based on their gender."{{cite web|url=http://www.ussc.gov/Research_and_Statistics/Research_Projects/Miscellaneous/15_Year_Study/chap4.pdf|title=Chapter Four: Racial, Ethnic, and Gender Disparities In Federal Sentencing Today|publisher=Ussc.gov|access-date=August 30, 2013|archive-date=August 23, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823204828/http://www.ussc.gov/Research_and_Statistics/Research_Projects/Miscellaneous/15_Year_Study/chap4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender discrimination also helps explain the differences between trial outcomes in which some female defendants are sentenced to death and other female defendants are sentenced to lesser punishments. [[Phillip Barron]] argues that female defendants are more likely to be sentenced to death for crimes that violate gender norms, such as killing children or killing strangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barron|first1=Phillip|title=Gender Discrimination in the U.S. Death Penalty System|journal=[[Radical Philosophy Review]]|date=2000|volume=3|issue=1|pages=89–96|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/BARGDI|doi=10.5840/radphilrev20003110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgender people face widespread discrimination while incarcerated. They are generally housed according to their legal birth sex, rather than their gender identity. Studies have shown that transgender people are at an increased risk for harassment and sexual assault in this environment. They may also be denied access to medical procedures related to their reassignment.&lt;ref&gt;"Unlike race and ethnic discrimination, however, the evidence is more consistent that part of this gap is due to different treatment of offenders based on their gender."{{cite web|url=http://www.autostraddle.com/real-life-sophia-bursets-transgender-women-face-a-nightmare-in-mens-prisons-186876/|title=Real life Sophia Bursets Transgender Women face a nightmare in Men's Prisons|access-date=October 18, 2013|date=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries use [[stoning]] as a form of capital punishment. According to Amnesty International, the majority of those stoned are women and women are disproportionately affected by stoning because of sexism in the legal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=January 15, 2008|title=Amnesty International—Iran: Death by stoning, a grotesque and unacceptable penalty|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/iran-death-stoning-grotesque-and-unacceptable-penalty-20080115|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020184028/http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/iran-death-stoning-grotesque-and-unacceptable-penalty-20080115|archive-date=October 20, 2013|website=amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study found that: &lt;blockquote&gt;[O]n average, women receive lighter sentences in comparison with men{{nbsp}}... roughly 30% of the gender differences in incarceration cannot be explained by the observed criminal characteristics of offense and offender. We also find evidence of considerable heterogeneity across judges in their treatment of female and male offenders. There is little evidence, however, that tastes for gender discrimination are driving the mean gender disparity or the variance in treatment between judges.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Butcher |first1=Kristin F. |last2=Park |first2=Kyung H. |first3=Anne |last3=Morrison Piehl|title=Comparing Apples to Oranges: Differences in Women's and Men's Incarceration and Sentencing Outcomes |journal=[[Journal of Labor Economics]] |volume=35 |issue=S1 |year=2017 |pages=S201–S234 |doi=10.1086/691276 |s2cid=149991197 |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w23079.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 2017 study by Knepper found that "female plaintiffs filing workplace sex discrimination claims are substantially more likely to settle and win compensation whenever a female judge is assigned to the case. Additionally, female judges are 15 percentage points less likely than male judges to grant motions filed by defendants, which suggests that final negotiations are shaped by the emergence of the bias."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Knepper |first=Matthew |date=2017 |title=When the Shadow is the Substance: Judge Gender and the Outcomes of Workplace Sex Discrimination Cases |journal=Journal of Labor Economics |volume=  36|issue=3 |pages=623–664 |doi=10.1086/696150 |s2cid=157714160 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender bias and gender-based discrimination still permeate the education process in many settings. For example, in the teaching and learning process, including differential engagement, expectations and interactions by teachers with their male and female students, as well as gender stereotypes in [[textbook]]s and learning materials. There has been a lack in adequate resources and infrastructure to ensure safe and enabling [[learning environment]]s, and insufficient policy, legal and planning frameworks, that respect, protect and fulfil the [[right to education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=UNESCO|url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000369000?posInSet=1&amp;queryId=1d7dd56b-7298-433b-a194-50d378d393e6|title=From access to empowerment: UNESCO strategy for gender equality in and through education 2019-2025|publisher=UNESCO|year=2019|isbn=978-92-3-100330-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
