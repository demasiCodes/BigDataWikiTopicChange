'''Sexism''' is commonly considered to be [[discrimination]] and/or [[hatred]] against people based on their [[sex]] rather than their individual merits, but can also refer to any and all systemic differentiations based on the sex of the individuals.

'''Sexism''' can refer to subtly different beliefs or attitudes:
*The belief that one [[gender]] or [[sex]] is inferior to or more valuable than the other;
*Female or male [[chauvinism]]
*The attitude of [[misogyny]] (hatred of females) or [[misandry]] (hatred of males); as well as
*The attitude of imposing a limited and/or false notion of [[masculinity]] on [[males]] and a limited and/or false notion of [[femininity]] on [[females]], or vice versa.
*A feeling of distrust towards the opposite or same sex, most frequently operating at unconscious level.

== Generalization and partition ==
Sexist beliefs, as a species of [[essentialism]], holds that individuals can be understood or be judged simply based on the characteristics of the group to which they belong&amp;mdash;in this case, their sexual group, as males or females.  This assumes that all individuals fit into the category of ''male'' or ''female'' and does not take into account of [[intersex]]ed people who are born with a mixture of male and female sexual characteristics.&lt;!-- Note:  the mixed sexual characteristics are not necessarily _primary_ sexual characteristics.  Ambiguous genitalia (primary) are not a _sine qua non_ of intersexuality. See the page on Intersex for more details. --&gt;  This also assumes a [[wiktionary:Homogeneous|homogeneous]] characteristics of all males and all females and does not take into account the huge differences within a group.  There are also [[XX male syndrome|XX males]] and [[XY female syndrome|XY females]] who are genetically one sex but have developed sexual characteristics of another sex at foetal stage.

Certain forms of sexual [[discrimination]] are illegal in many countries, but nearly all countries have laws that give special rights, privileges, or responsibilities to one sex or two sexes.

=== Sexism against females ===
'''Sexism against [[females]]''' in its extreme form is known as [[misogyny]], which is derived from the Greek for "hatred of females".  The term 'sexism', in common usage, usually implies sexism against females, since this is the first form of sexism that has been commonly identified.  This form of sexism is also often called [[chauvinism]], though chauvinism is actually a wider term for any extreme and unreasoning partisanship with malice and hatred towards a rival group.  A mildly related term is ''[[wikt:gynophobia|gynophobia]]'', which refers to fears of [[females]] or [[feminity]].  

Historically, in many [[patriarchal]] societies, females were and are viewed as the "weaker sex".  Women's lower status is evident in cases in which females were not even recognized as [[person]]s under the law of the land. The [[feminism|feminist]] [[feminist movement|movement]] promotes [[women's rights]] to stop sexism against females by addressing issues such as equality under the law, political representation of females, access to education and employment, female victims of domestic violence, self-ownership of the female body, and the impact of [[pornography]] on women. While feminists broadly agree on the aims and goals of feminism, they may disagree on any one issue (for instance, pornography or abortion), tactics, or priorities.

=== Sexism against males ===
'''Sexism against [[males]]''' in its extreme form is known as [[misandry]], which is derived from the Greek for "hatred of males".  It is often known as "reverse sexism", however this term has recently received criticism for its assumption that sexism is usually, primarily, or initially, misogyny.  Therefore, the term "reverse sexism" is not frequently used by sociologists.   A related term is [[androphobia]], which refers to the fear of [[males]] or [[masculinity]]. While the view that women are superior to men is also sexism, only in recent years has such awareness begun to develop in public discourse{{Fact|date=August 2007}}.

Some critics, such as [[libertarian]] [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] (whom some consider an [[Christina Hoff Sommers#Responses to Hoff Sommers|antifeminist]]) and popular authors [[Nathanson and Young]], have charged that of the modern feminist movement have deviated from the original goals of feminism (creating equality for women) and have instead focused on the advancement of female power and dominance through suppressing and spreading misandrist views about men. Another source of sexism is the "old patriarchy" and "old matriarchy"{{Fact|date=June 2007}}, which has historically restricted and limited the role of males in other parts of society and has looked down upon male [[homemaker]]s {{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

Dr. Michael Flood, a sociologist at La Trobe University's Australian Research Centre in Sex writes, "The men in men's rights groups are typically in their forties and fifties, often divorced or separated, and nearly always heterosexual. In both general men's rights groups and fathers' rights groups, participants often are very angry, bitter and hurting (with good reason, they would say), and they often have gone through deeply painful marriage breakups and custody battles...

=== Sexism against transsexes ===
{{main|Transphobias}}

'''Sexism against [[transsex]]es''' has also only been recently identified, and it has also yet to enter into the public discourse.  Traditionally, transsexes are viewed as having [[psychological]] problem of [[gender identity disorder]], or more recently viewed as simply being radically [[Homosexuality|homosexual]].

''Transsexuality'' refers to the condition of being self-identified with the opposite sex and the [[LGBT]] movement has actively fought sexism against transexes.  The most typical forms of sexism against transsexuals are how many "women-only" and "men-only" events and organizations have been criticized for rejecting transfemales, and transmales respectively.  Transsexed people are also often the target of [[hate crimes]], as the traditional notion of masculinity and femininity is often perceived to be threatened by those who adopt a different sex later in life.

== Sexism and sexual expression ==
The expression of sexual intimacy is a part of the [[human condition]].  However, various aspects of human sexuality have been argued as having contributed to sexism.  

=== The Sexual Revolution ===
During the [[sexual revolution]], there was a change in the cultural perception of sexual morality and sexual behavior.  The sexual revolution has been known as the [[sexually liberal feminism|sexual liberation]] by [[feminist]]s since some saw this new development in the West as a leveling ground for females to have as many choices concerning their sexuality as males--hoping to elliminate the problematic virgin/whore dichotomy of traditional Western society. 

Modern feminists like [[Ariel Levy]] have warned that the current state of commercial sexuality has created a "[[Raunch Culture]]"{{Fact|date=June 2007}}. This cultural development, (which has largely occurred in the West) the commercialization of the sexual objectification of females, has been criticized as being limiting for men and women. Rather than being liberating, some feminists argue that the "pornification" of Western society has reduced and equated the scope of feminine power to sexual power only. Some feminists argue that females are themselves objectifying other females by becoming producers and promoters of the "[[Raunch Culture]]". 

Some [[masculist]] theorists posit that prior to the sexual revolution the idealized male was expected to be virile while the idealized female was expected to be modest.  They note that after the sexual revolution, females were given more liberty to express virility while the reverse has not been true for males, who have yet to be given a choice to be non-virile.  They argued that the dual identity of [[hypersexuality]] and [[asexuality]] is a luxury and special status that only exists for females. However, many feminists believe that this dual identity rather allows males to condemn a female for her sexuality for being either modest or virile (see [[double standard]]).

=== Pornography ===
Some individuals express the view that [[pornography]] is contributing to sexism, because in usual pornographic performances for male spectators the actresses are sexually objectified. The narrative is formed around male pleasure as the only goal of sexual activity. The [[Germany|German]] feminist [[Alice Schwarzer]] is one representative of this point of view. She has brought this topic up repeatedly since the [[1970s]], in particular in the feminist magazine ''Emma''.  The reverse, where female spectators are objectifying male actors, has also been identified as sexism.

On the other hand, some famous pornographic actresses such as [[Teresa Orlowski]] and [[Tímea Vágvölgyi]] have publicly stated that they do not feel themselves to be victims of sexism against females.  In fact, many female pornographic stars and [[sex-positive feminist]]s view pornography to be progressive, since they are paid money for performing consensual acts, and also since many directors and managers of the industry are women as well.  Porn positive feminists often support their position by pointing out the situation of women in countries with strict pornography laws (ie Saudi Arabia) versus women in countries with liberal pornography laws (ie the Netherlands). This does not however take into account that even though the women taking part in pornography choose to do so in large part because they are given money for it, they will still be seen as sexual trade objects by the viewers and consumers of pornography. Many anti-pornography supporters also believe that pornography gives a distorted view of men and women's bodies, as well as the actual sexual act, often showing the performers with synthetic implants or exaggerative, fake moans of pleasure. Many pornographic films also show the woman as being extremely passive, or performing degrading acts solely for the pleasure of their sexual partner, and the viewer.

Those advocating against pornography often fail to take homosexual pornography into account. The same arguments used against heterosexual pornography could be adapted to homosexual pornography. If it assumed that watching pornography inherently involves objectifying the actors and that objectifying someone is a form of sexism, than homosexuals who watch homosexual pornography would also be guilty of sexism against their own gender. Many people find this argument [[Reductio ad absurdum|absurd]] and falsely believe that this indicates that the arguments used against heterosexual pornography are unsound. Of course not all advocates against pornography make the argument that objectification only equals sexism and vice versa. Many uphold the view that pornography can be objectifying without the viewer necessarily being sexist against members of their own sex.

Still other feminists, outside of the [[porn-positive feminism]] and [[anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography feminism]], feared that censoring [[profit]]-oriented pornography would lead to censoring legitimate [[non-profit]] female expression of their sexual experience.  This is because historically, indecency acts in various countries had, in the past, been used to censor sexual educations, which are vital to the sexual independence of females and females taking ownership of the decisions over their bodies. Thus two independent matters get regrettably entangled.

== Sexism and linguistics ==
It has been argued that sexual dichotomies exist in language, though it is disputed whether certain language causes sexism or sexism causes certain language (see the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]]).  

=== Sexist language and Gender-neutral language ===
Nearing the end of the 20th century, there is a rise in the use of gender-neutral language in western worlds.  This is often attributed to the rise of [[feminism]].  [[Gender-neutral language]], as a part of [[political correctness]], is the avoidance of [[gender-specific job title]]s, [[Non-parallel usage#Disputed issues|non-parallel usage]], and other usage that is felt by some to be sexist.  Supporters feel that having gender-specific titles and gender-specific pronouns implies a system bias to exclude individuals based on their sex.  Opponents question whether such avoidance campaign is themselves engaging in [[semantics]] injection.  Some opponents dismiss this trend as "[[political correctness]] gone mad"{{Fact|date=June 2007}} and protest against what they see as [[censorship]].  Others like [[misandry]] researchers Nathonson and Young see the term 'gender' as a blatantly biased "front" for what they call "ideological" feminism{{Fact|date=June 2007}}.

=== Anthropological linguistics and gender-specific language ===
Unlike the [[Indo-European languages]] in the west, for many other [[languages]] around the world, [[gender-specific pronouns]] are a recent phenomenon that occur around the early-20th century.  As a result of [[colonialism]], cultural revolution occurred in many parts of the world with attempts to "modernize" and "westernize" by adding gender-specific pronouns and animate-inanimate pronouns to local languages.  This ironically resulted in the situation of what was [[gender-neutral pronouns]] a century ago suddenly becoming gender-specific.  (See for example [[Gender-neutrality in languages without grammatical gender#Turkish|Gender-neutrality in languages without grammatical gender: Turkish]].)
{{confusing|date=September 2007}}
In those parts of the world, some feminists, who are unaware of the etymology of their own language, complain about what they perceived as "sexist language" with arguments like "traditional language fails to reflect the presence of women in modern society adequately"{{Fact|date=June 2007}} similar to the west.  However, other feminists, who are aware of historical linguistics, realize that the traditional language in their part of the world is inherently gender-neutral.  They instead decide to revive the original gender-neutral usage from over a century ago with [[Reclaiming|reclamation]] projects.
For example, when the sex of something is unknown, is it always referred to as a "he," or when using the term "one," typically "himself" is used also.  As well as those examples, in the phrase "him and her," the "him" always comes first.  Furthermore, in some combined words such as "postman", the word man, wich is clearly not gender neutral, is used, whereas woman, or a gender neutral alternative (which doesn't even exist in many languages), is never used.

=== Reappropriation and reclamation ===
'''Reappropriation''' (aka '''reclamation projects''') describe a cultural process by which certain groups reclaim or re-appropriate terms, symbols, and artifacts that were previously used to discriminate.  Within the [[English language]], terms like '[[bitch]]' and '[[slut]]', which had been historically used as [[pejorative]] sexist remarks against [[females]].  They have since been used to refer to a "strong, independent, unattached female" and a "[[Sexually liberal feminism|sexually liberal]], [[hypersexual]] female"{{Fact|date=June 2007}}.  Similarly, terms like '[[girlie men]]' and '[[transgender|tranny]]', which has been historically used as pejorative sexist remarks against [[transsex]]es, have since been used to refer to the varying degree of transexuality for "pre-operation" and "non-operation" as whether they had undergone or will undergo sex-reassignment or not.  The success of these cultural process has been disputed.

On the flip side, the word 'dude' as a pejorative has crossed the sexes and is being applied to males.  In politics, the term 'girlie men' has also been used by [[Governor Schwarzenegger]] to attack his political opponents, who are not transsexes.  This has led to Schwarzenegger being accused of being sexist.

== Sexual discrimination and law ==
'''Sex discrimination''' is [[discrimination]] based on [[sex]]. Currently, discrimination because of sex is defined as adverse action against another person, that would not have occurred had the person been of another sex. This is considered a form of [[prejudice]] and is illegal in certain enumerated circumstances throughout most countries.

U.S. law has also included discrimination based upon pregnancy in the workplace as discrimination based upon sex with the Pregnancy Discrimination Act embodied in the [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]].
