'''Gay bashing''' and '''gay bullying''' is [[verbal abuse|verbal]] or [[physical abuse]] against a person who is perceived by the aggressor to be  [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]], including persons who are actually [[heterosexual]] or of non-specific or unknown [[sexual orientation]].

A "[[Bashing (pejorative)|bashing]]" may be a specific incident, and one could also use the verb ''to bash'' (e.g. "I was gay bashed."). A verbal gay bashing might use sexual slurs, expletives, [[intimidation]], and threatened or actual violence. It also might take place in a political forum and include one or more common [[anti-gay slogan]]s.

Gay bullying involves intentional and unprovoked actions toward the victim, repeated negative actions by one or more people against another person, and an imbalance of physical or psychological power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=US Dept of Education |title=Bullying Myths and Facts |accessdate=October 2, 2010 |url=http://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/training/bullying/bullying_pg3.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325204905/http://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/training/bullying/bullying_pg3.html |archivedate=March 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar terms such as ''lesbian bullying'', ''[[queer]] bullying'', and ''queer bashing'' may also be formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/violence-against-queer-people/9780813573151|title=Violence against Queer People|last=Meyer|first=Doug|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay bashing has occurred worldwide for many decades and continues today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Thomas|last=Rogers|url=http://www.salon.com/2010/12/12/lgbt_bullying_interview/|title=Explaining American schools' gay bullying epidemic|publisher=Salon.com|accessdate=December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homophobia in the United States]] was especially serious in the late 1940s and early 1950s, when many gay people were forced out of government by boards set up by Presidents [[Harry S. Truman]] and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. As historian David K. Johnson explains:&lt;ref name="uchicago"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/404811in.html|publisher=University of Chicago Press|title=An interview with David K. Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The [[Lavender Scare]] helped fan the flames of the [[Red Scare]]. In popular discourse, [[communist]]s and homosexuals were often conflated. Both groups were perceived as hidden [[subculture]]s with their own meeting places, literature, cultural codes, and bonds of loyalty. Both groups were thought to recruit to their ranks the psychologically weak or disturbed. And both groups were considered immoral and godless. Many people believed that the two groups were working together to undermine the government.}}

Johnson concludes that Senator [[Joe McCarthy]], notorious for his attacks on alleged communists in government, was often pressured by his allies to denounce homosexuals in government, but he resisted and did not do so.&lt;ref name="uchicago" /&gt; Using rumors collected by [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]], one [[Nevada]] publisher wrote in 1952 that both McCarthy and his chief counsel, [[Roy Cohn]], were homosexuals.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;After McCarthy called him an ex-Communist, [[Hank Greenspun]] wrote: "It is common talk among homosexuals in [[Milwaukee]] who rendezvous in the White Horse Inn that Senator Joe McCarthy has often engaged in homosexual activities." [[Las Vegas Sun]], October 25, 1952. McCarthy later explained he meant to call Greenspun an ex-convict (which was true), rather than an ex-Communist (which was false).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Washington Post]]'' editor [[Benjamin C. Bradlee]] said, "There was a lot of time spent investigating" these allegations, "although no one came close to proving it."  No reputable McCarthy biographer has accepted it as probable.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The allegations are specifically rejected in Richard Rovere, ''Senator Joe McCarthy'' (1969), p. 68; see also Robert D. Dean, ''Imperial Brotherhood: Gender and the Making of Cold War Foreign Policy'' (2001) p. 149 (includes Bradlee quote); Kyle A. Cuordileone, ''Manhood and American Political Culture in the Cold War'' (2003), p. 94; Thomas Patrick Doherty, ''Cold War, Cool Medium: Television, McCarthyism, and American Culture,'' (2003), p. 228. Geoff Schumacher, ''Sun, Sin &amp; Suburbia: An Essential History of Modern Las Vegas'' (2004), p. 144, concludes, "Greenspun descended into mud-spewing rhetoric that would make the [[National Enquirer]] blanch." Knowing that McCarthy would not dare enter Nevada, where he would be served with a lawsuit for defaming Greenspun, Greenspun punished McCarthy with his own weapon of anonymous, scandalous accusations.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Queer bullying ===

[[Egale Canada]] conducted a survey of more than 3700 high school students in Canada between December 2007 and June 2009. The final report of the survey, "Every Class in Every School",&lt;ref&gt;[http://egale.ca/youth-and-safer-schools/every-class/ Every Class in Every School], Final Report on the First National Climate Survey on Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia in Canadian Schools, Egale Canada&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2011, found that 70% of all students participating heard "that's so gay" daily at school, and 48% of respondents heard "faggot", "lezbo" and "dyke" daily. 58% or about 1400 of the 2400 heterosexual students participating in EGALE's survey found homophobic comments upsetting.
Further, EGALE found that students not directly affected by [[homophobia]], [[biphobia]] or [[transphobia]] were less aware of it. This finding relates to research done in the area of [[Empathy gap|empathy gaps for social pain]] which suggests that those not directly experiencing social pain (in this case, bullying) consistently underestimate its effects and thus may not adequately respond to the needs of one experiencing social pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nordgren | first1 = L.

A research study of 78 eleven to fourteen-year-old boys conducted in twelve schools in London, England between 1998 and 1999&lt;ref name="Phoenix" /&gt; revealed that respondents who used the word "gay" to label another boy in a derogatory manner intended the word as "just a joke", "just a cuss" and not as a statement of one's perceived [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pascoe, C. J. (2007). Dude You're a Fag, Masculinity and Sexuality in High School. Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; American sociologist [[Michael Kimmel]] and American psychologist [[Gregory Herek]] write that [[masculinity]] is a renunciation of the feminine and that males shore up their sense of their masculinity by denigrating the feminine and ultimately the homosexual.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, M.

Gay and lesbian youth are more likely to report bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Berlan, ED |author2=Corliss, HL |author3=Field, AE |title= Sexual Orientation and Bullying Among Adolescents in the Growing Up Today Study |journal= Journal of Adolescent Health |date=April 2010 |volume=46 |pages=366–71 | doi = 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2009.10.015 |pmid=20307826 |pmc=2844864 |issue=4|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, boys who were bullied with taunts of being gay suffered more bullying and more negative effects compared with boys who were bullied with other categories of taunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Swearer, SM |author2=Turner, RT |author3=Givens, JE |title="You’re so gay!": Do different forms of bullying matter for adolescent males? |journal= School Psychology Review |year=2008 |volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of queer bullying ==

Gay and lesbian youth can develop severe forms of depression and anxiety as they grow up. In fact, 71.4% of LGBT folk experience major depression disorder (MDD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sweet|first1=Matt|title=Depression and Anxiety in LGBT People: What You Need to Know|url=http://www.mattsweet.com/lgbt-anxiety-depression-guide.pdf|accessdate=July 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For LGBT individuals, MDD can be caused by any of the following: self-esteem, pressure to conform, minority stress, coming out, family rejection, parenting, relationship formation, and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sweet|first1=Matt|title=Depression and Anxiety in the LGBT People: What You Need to Know|url=http://www.mattsweet.com/lgbt-anxiety-depression-guide.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-esteem and pressure to conform go hand in hand. When an LGBT individual is told what to look like and who to love, it puts a toll on their self-esteem. When people make comments about who they are, what they look like, who they love, etc. it begins to make them feel insecure. It makes them feel as though they aren't good enough the way they are. "Coming-out" is a terms that is used to describe when an LGBT individual makes it known that they are gay, lesbian, etc. Coming out is usually the first factor that will affect a person involved in the LGBT community because when they first discover who they really are, their instinct is to confide in their parents to help them through it (Markheim, Personal Interview). When they experience family rejection after coming out, they automatically fel unwanted and unloved. This can set them into a downward spiral of depression. Parenting and relationship formation are very closely related because usually, people feel more comfortable parenting with their significant other rather than alone, especially if they are involved in the LGBT community. Just recently, in March 2016, is became legal for LGBT parents to adopt in all 50 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reilly|first1=Mollie|title=Same-Sex Couples Can Now Adopt Children in All 50 States|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mississippi-same-sex-adoption_us_56fdb1a3e4b083f5c607567f|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=July 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not being able to conceive their own child can already cause depression, but when they were denied the right to adopt, it caused even more pain. Minority stress is not the biggest of all the factors, but it doesn't make anybody feel better. Minority stress is defined as a stress experienced by LGBT individuals due to their sexual orientation/gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyer|first1=Ilan|title=Minority Stress and Mental Health in Gay Men|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|date=March 1995|volume= 36|issue= 1|page=38 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ilan_Meyer/publication/15461517_Minority_Stress_and_Mental_Health_in_Gay_Men/links/0deec53ad819484a10000000/Minority-Stress-and-Mental-Health-in-Gay-Men.pdf|accessdate=July 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence can slip anybody into a depressed state whether the violence is a type of physical abuse, mental abuse, or verbal abuse. A person can be harassed to the point where their depression becomes to much and they no longer experience any happiness. These factors all work together and make it extremely hard to avoid MDD.

== Effects of queer bullying ==

Queer bullying may make some victims feel sad and unsafe in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glew | first1 = G.

Some victims might feel paralyzed and withdraw socially as a coping mechanism.&lt;ref name="Crozier" /&gt; Other victims of queer bullying may begin to live the effects of [[learned helplessness]].&lt;ref name="Roth" /&gt; Queer or [[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]] students may try to pass as heterosexual in order to avoid queer bullying. [[Passing (sexual orientation)|Passing]] isolates the student from other queer or questioning students, potential [[Straight ally|allies]], and support.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; Adults who try to pass also may feel the effects emotionally and psychologically, of this effort to conceal their true identities.&lt;ref name="Herek" /&gt;
Queer and questioning youth who experience bullying have a higher incidence of substance abuse and STI and HIV infection,&lt;ref name="R&amp;J" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Russell | first1 = S.

Queer bullying may also be seen as a manifestation of what American academic [[Ilan Meyer]] calls ''[[minority stress]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meyer | first1 = I. H. | year = 1995 | title = Minority Stress and Mental Health in Gay Men | url = | journal = Journal of Health and Social Behavior | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 38–56 | doi=10.2307/2137286| pmid = 7738327 | jstor = 2137286 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which may affect sexual and ethno-racial minorities attempting to exist within a challenging broader society.

== Explicit and implicit homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings ==

Homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings can be categorized as explicit and implicit. Explicit homophobic and transphobic violence consists of overt acts that make subjects feel uncomfortable, hurt, humiliated or intimidated. Peers and educational staff are unlikely to intervene when witnessing these incidents. This contributes to normalizing such acts that become accepted as either a routine disciplinary measure or a means to resolve con icts among students. Homophobic and transphobic violence – as with all school-related gender-based violence – is acutely underreported due to subjects’ fear of retribution, combined with inadequate or non-existent reporting, support and redress systems.&lt;ref&gt;GMR, UNESCO, and UNGEI, ‘School-related gender-based violence is preventing the achievement of quality education for all: Policy Paper 17 at 59th session of the Commission on the Status of Women in New York City’, 59th session of the Commission on the Status of Women in New York City. UNESCO, p. 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plan International, ‘A Girl’s Right to Learn Without Fear: Working to end gender-based violence at school’, Plan Limited, Surrey, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.

Grimes, ‘Guidance for Gender Based Violence (GBV) Monitoring and Mitigation within Non-GBV Focused Sectoral Programming’, CARE USA, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plan UK, ‘Ending school-related gender-based violence: Brie ng paper’, London, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of effective policies, protection or remedies contributes to a vicious cycle where incidents become increasingly normal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002447/244756e.pdf|title=Out in the Open: Education sector responses to violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100150-5|location=|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Implicit homophobic and transphobic violence, sometimes called ‘symbolic violence’ or ‘institutional’ violence, is subtler than explicit violence. It consists of pervasive representations or attitudes that sometimes feel harmless or natural to the school community, but that allow or encourage homophobia and transphobia, including perpetuating harmful stereotypes. Policies and guidelines can reinforce or embed these representations or attitudes, whether in an individual institution or across an entire education sector. This way, they can become part of everyday practices and rules guiding school behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;ICGBV, ‘Addressing School Related Gender Based Violence: Learning from Practice: Learning Brief No. 10’, Irish Consortium on Gender Based Violence, Dublin, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Leach, M. Dunne, and F. Salvi, ‘School-Related Gender based Violence: A global review of current issues and approaches in policy, programming and implementation responses to School-Related Gender-Based Violence (SRGBV) for the Education Sector’, UNESCO, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Examples of implicit homophobic and transphobic violence include:

* Asserting that some subjects are better suited to students based on their sexual orientation or gender identity/expression (for example, science for heterosexual male students and drama for gay male students).
* Suggesting that it is normal for heterosexual students to have greater agency or influence (for example, with the opinions of LGBTI students treated as marginal and unimportant).
* Reinforcing stereotypes related to sexual orientation or gender identity/expression in curriculum materials or teacher training, such as through images and discourse (for example, that refer to heterosexuality as ‘normal’).
* Reinforcing stereotypes related to sexual orientation or gender identity/expression in educational policies, rules and regulations (for example, by not even acknowledging that LGBTI students are part of the school community and by not specifying them in relevant policies).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Statistics and examples ==

Teens face harassment, threats, and violence. A 1998 study in the US by [[Mental Health America]] found that students heard anti-gay slurs such as "homo", "faggot" and "sissy" about 26 times a day on average, or once every 14 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mental Health American, Bullying and Gay Youth |url=http://www.nmha.org/go/information/get-info/children-s-mental-health/bullying-and-gay-youth |publisher=National Mental Health Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414144851/http://www.nmha.org/go/information/get-info/children-s-mental-health/bullying-and-gay-youth |archivedate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, a union for UK professionals, the word “gay” was reported to be the most popular term of abuse heard by teachers on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How 'gay' Became Children's Insult of Choice|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7289390.stm|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About two-thirds of gay and lesbian students in [[Great Britain|British]] schools have suffered from gay bullying in 2007, according to a study done by the [[Schools Education Unit]] for [[LGBT|LGB]] activist group [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]]. Almost all that had been bullied had experienced verbal attacks, 41 percent had been physically attacked, and 17 percent had received death threats. It also showed that over 50% of teachers did not respond to homophobic language which they had explicitly heard in the classroom, and only 25% of schools had told their students that homophobic bullying was wrong, showing "a shocking picture of the extent of homophobic bullying undertaken by fellow pupils and, alarmingly, school staff",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=BBC News|title=Gay Bullying in Schools Common|date=June 26, 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6239098.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; with further studies conducted by the same charity in 2012 stated that 90% of teachers had had no training on the prevention of homophobic bullying. However, Ofsted's new 2012 framework did ask schools what they would be doing in order to combat the issue.&lt;ref name=Stonewall1&gt;{{cite web|title=Homophobic bullying|url=http://www.stonewall.org.uk/at_school/education_for_all/secondary_schools/homophobic_bullying/default.asp|website=stonewall.org.uk|publisher=Stonewall |accessdate=December 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of suicide is higher among LGBT people.
