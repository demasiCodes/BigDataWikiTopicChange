'''Gay bashing''' is an attack, [[abuse]], or [[assault]] committed against a person who is perceived by the aggressor to be [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]] or [[queer]] ([[LGBTQ+]]). It includes both  [[violence against LGBT people]] and [[LGBT bullying]]. The term covers violence against and bullying of people who are LGBT, as well as non-LGBT people whom the attacker perceives to be LGBT. 

Physical gay bashings sometimes involve extreme violence or murder motivated by the victim's [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], or [[gender expression]].

LGBT youth are more likely to report bullying than non-LGBT youth, particularly in schools. Victims of LGBT bullying may feel unsafe, resulting in depression and anxiety, including increased rates of suicide and attempted suicide. LGBT students may try to [[Passing (sexual orientation)|pass]] as heterosexual to escape the bullying, leading to further stress and isolation from available supports. Support organizations exist in many countries to prevent LGBT bullying and support victims. Some jurisdictions have passed legislation against LGBT bullying and harassment.

== Violence  ==
{{main|Violence against LGBT people}}
LGBT people frequently experience violence directed toward their [[human sexuality|sexuality]], [[gender identity]], or [[gender expression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Doug|title=An Intersectional Analysis of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) People's Evaluations of Anti-Queer Violence|journal=Gender &amp; Society|date=December 2012|volume=26|issue=6|pages=849–873|doi=10.1177/0891243212461299|s2cid=145812781}}&lt;/ref&gt; This violence may be enacted by the state, as in laws [[LGBT rights by country or territory|prescribing punishment]] for homosexual acts, or by individuals. It may be motivated by [[biphobia]], [[gayphobia]], [[homophobia]], [[lesbophobia]], and [[transphobia]]. Influencing factors may be [[Societal attitudes toward homosexuality|cultural]], [[religion and sexual orientation|religious]], or political [[mores]] and biases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/violence-against-queer-people/9780813573151|title=Violence against Queer People|last=Meyer|first=Doug|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2015|access-date=2017-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190515035337/https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/violence-against-queer-people/9780813573151/|archive-date=2019-05-15|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bullying ==
{{main|LGBT bullying}}
Bullying of LGBT people, particularly LGBT youth, involves intentional actions toward the victim, repeated negative actions by one or more people against another person, and an imbalance of physical or psychological power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=US Dept of Education |title=Bullying Myths and Facts |access-date=October 2, 2010 |url=http://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/training/bullying/bullying_pg3.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325204905/http://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/training/bullying/bullying_pg3.html |archive-date=March 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
