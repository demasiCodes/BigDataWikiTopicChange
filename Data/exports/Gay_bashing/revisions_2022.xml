'''Gay bashing''' is an attack, [[abuse]], or [[assault]] committed against a person who is perceived by the aggressor to be [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexual]], or [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]). It includes both  [[violence against LGBT people]] and '''LGBT bullying'''. The term covers violence against and bullying of people who are LGBT, as well as [[heterosexual]] people whom the attacker perceives to be LGBT. 

Physical gay bashings sometimes involve extreme violence or murder motivated by the victim's [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], or [[gender expression]].

LGBT youth are more likely to report bullying than non-LGBT youth, particularly in schools. Victims of LGBT bullying may feel unsafe, resulting in depression and anxiety, including increased rates of suicide and attempted suicide. LGBT students may try to [[Passing (sexual orientation)|pass]] as heterosexual to escape the bullying, leading to further stress and isolation from available supports. Support organizations exist in many countries to prevent LGBT bullying and support victims. Some jurisdictions have passed legislation against LGBT bullying and harassment.

== Violence  ==
{{main|Violence against LGBT people}}
LGBT people frequently experience violence directed toward their [[human sexuality|sexuality]], [[gender identity]], or [[gender expression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Doug|title=An Intersectional Analysis of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) People's Evaluations of Anti-Queer Violence|journal=Gender &amp; Society|date=December 2012|volume=26|issue=6|pages=849–873|doi=10.1177/0891243212461299|s2cid=145812781}}&lt;/ref&gt; This violence may be enacted by the state, as in laws [[LGBT rights by country or territory|prescribing punishment]] for homosexual acts, or by individuals. It may be motivated by [[biphobia]], [[gayphobia]], [[homophobia]], [[lesbophobia]], and [[transphobia]]. Influencing factors may be [[Societal attitudes toward homosexuality|cultural]], [[religion and sexual orientation|religious]], or political [[mores]] and biases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/violence-against-queer-people/9780813573151|title=Violence against Queer People|last=Meyer|first=Doug|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2015|access-date=2017-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190515035337/https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/violence-against-queer-people/9780813573151/|archive-date=2019-05-15|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bullying ==
Bullying of LGBT people, particularly LGBT youth, involves intentional actions toward the victim, repeated negative actions by one or more people against another person, and an imbalance of physical or psychological power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=US Dept of Education |title=Bullying Myths and Facts |access-date=October 2, 2010 |url=http://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/training/bullying/bullying_pg3.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325204905/http://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/training/bullying/bullying_pg3.html |archive-date=March 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Schools ===

Homophobic and transphobic violence in schools can be categorized as explicit and implicit. Explicit homophobic and transphobic violence consists of overt acts that make subjects feel uncomfortable, hurt, humiliated or intimidated. Peers and educational staff are unlikely to intervene when witnessing these incidents. {{Citation needed|date=November 2022}} This contributes to normalizing such acts that become accepted as either a routine disciplinary measure or a means to resolve conflicts among students. Homophobic and transphobic violence – as with all school-related gender-based violence – is acutely underreported due to subjects' fear of retribution, combined with inadequate or non-existent reporting, support and redress systems.&lt;ref&gt;GMR, UNESCO, and UNGEI, ‘School-related gender-based violence is preventing the achievement of quality education for all: Policy Paper 17 at 59th session of the Commission on the Status of Women in New York City’, 59th session of the Commission on the Status of Women in New York City. UNESCO, p. 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plan International, ‘A Girl’s Right to Learn Without Fear: Working to end gender-based violence at school’, Plan Limited, Surrey, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.

Implicit homophobic and transphobic violence, sometimes called 'symbolic violence' or 'institutional' violence, is subtler than explicit violence. It consists of pervasive representations or attitudes that sometimes feel harmless or natural to the school community, but that allow or encourage homophobia and transphobia, including perpetuating harmful stereotypes. Policies and guidelines can reinforce or embed these representations or attitudes, whether in an individual institution or across an entire education sector. This way, they can become part of everyday practices and rules guiding school behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;ICGBV, ‘Addressing School Related Gender Based Violence: Learning from Practice: Learning Brief No. 10’, Irish Consortium on Gender Based Violence, Dublin, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Leach, M. Dunne, and F. Salvi, ‘School-Related Gender based Violence: A global review of current issues and approaches in policy, programming and implementation responses to School-Related Gender-Based Violence (SRGBV) for the Education Sector’, UNESCO, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Examples of implicit homophobic and transphobic violence include:

* Asserting that some subjects are better suited to students based on their sexual orientation or gender identity/expression (for example, science for heterosexual male students and drama for gay male students).
* Suggesting that it is normal for heterosexual students to have greater agency or influence (for example, with the opinions of LGBTI students treated as marginal and unimportant).
* Reinforcing stereotypes related to sexual orientation or gender identity/expression in curriculum materials or teacher training, such as through images and discourse (for example, that refer to heterosexuality as 'normal').
* Reinforcing stereotypes related to sexual orientation or gender identity/expression in educational policies, rules and regulations (for example, by not even acknowledging that LGBTI students are part of the school community and by not specifying them in relevant policies).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Egale Canada]], along with previous research, has found teachers and school administration may be complicit in LGBT bullying through their silence and/or inaction.&lt;ref name="Crozier"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crozier |first1=W.

Graffiti found on school grounds and property, and its "relative permanence",&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; is another form of LGBT bullying.

American sociologist [[Michael Kimmel]] and American psychologist [[Gregory Herek]] write that [[masculinity]] is a renunciation of the feminine and that males shore up their sense of their masculinity by denigrating the feminine and ultimately the homosexual.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, M. (2010). Masculinity as Homophobia, Fear, Shame and Silence in the Construction of Gender Identity. In M. S. Kimmel &amp; A. L. Ferber (Eds.), Privilege, A Reader (pp.107-131). Boulder: Westview Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herek"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herek |first1=G.

=== Effects ===

Victims of LGBT bullying may feel chronically depressed, anxious, and unsafe in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glew | first1 = G.

Some victims might feel paralyzed and withdraw socially as a coping mechanism.&lt;ref name="Crozier" /&gt; Others may begin to live the effects of [[learned helplessness]].&lt;ref name="Roth" /&gt; 

LGBT and questioning youth who experience bullying have a higher incidence of substance abuse and [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted infections]].&lt;ref name="R&amp;J" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Russell | first1 = S.

H. |year=1995 |title=Minority Stress and Mental Health in Gay Men |journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=38–56 |doi=10.2307/2137286 |jstor=2137286 |pmid=7738327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay and lesbian youth can develop severe forms of depression and anxiety as they grow up. Around 70% of LGBT people experience [[major depressive disorder]] (MDD) sometime in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sweet|first1=Matt|title=Depression and Anxiety in LGBT People: What You Need to Know|url=http://www.mattsweet.com/lgbt-anxiety-depression-guide.pdf|access-date=July 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For LGBT individuals, MDD can be caused by any of the following: self-esteem, pressure to conform, minority stress, coming out, family rejection, parenting, relationship formation, and violence.&lt;ref name="MDD"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sweet|first1=Matt|title=Depression and Anxiety in the LGBT People: What You Need to Know|url=http://www.mattsweet.com/lgbt-anxiety-depression-guide.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person can be harassed to the point where their depression becomes too much and they no longer experience any happiness. These factors all work together and make it extremely hard to avoid MDD.&lt;ref name="MDD" /&gt; 

The rate of suicide is higher among LGBT people:

* In a study conducted by the Schools Education Unit for UK charity [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]], an online survey reported that 71 percent of the girl participants who identified as LGBTQ, and 57 percent of the boy participants who identified as LGBTQ had seriously considered suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The School Report |url=https://www.stonewall.org.uk/sites/default/files/The_School_Report__2012_.pdf |publisher=Stonewall}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to a 1979 Jay and Young study, 40 percent of gay men and 39 percent of gay women in the US had attempted or seriously thought about suicide.&lt;ref name="ncmh"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gay Male and Lesbian Youth Suicide |year=1989 |url=http://www.ncmhjj.com/resource_kit/pdfs/Special%20Issues/References/GayMaleLesSuic.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714161413/http://www.ncmhjj.com/resource_kit/pdfs/Special%20Issues/References/GayMaleLesSuic.pdf |archive-date=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The [[American Foundation for Suicide Prevention]] has found that gay, lesbian and bisexual youth attempt suicide at a rate three to six times that of similar-age heterosexual youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Statistics |url=http://www.afsp.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.viewPage&amp;page_ID=CF7F9E5B-BF4B-52F3-4D4079E9991163DC |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206160614/http://www.afsp.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.viewPage&amp;page_id=CF7F9E5B-BF4B-52F3-4D4079E9991163DC |archive-date=December 6, 2010 |access-date=October 2, 2010 |publisher=[[American Foundation for Suicide Prevention]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In 1985, F. Paris estimated that suicides by gay youth may comprise up to 30 percent of all youth suicides in the US. This contributes to suicide being the third leading cause for death among youth aged 10–24, reported by the CDC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suicide Prevention|url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/suicide/youth_suicide.html|publisher=Center for Disease Control and Prevention|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504155435/https://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/suicide/youth_suicide.html|archive-date=May 4, 2017|df=mdy-all|date=2019-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

LGBT or [[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]] students may try to pass as heterosexual in order to avoid LGBT bullying. [[Passing (sexual orientation)|Passing]] isolates the student from other LGBT or questioning students, potential [[Straight ally|allies]], and support.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; Adults who try to pass also may feel the effects emotionally and psychologically, of this effort to conceal their true identities.&lt;ref name="Herek" /&gt; 

=== Statistics ===

==== Canada ====
[[Egale Canada]] conducted a survey of more than 3,700 high school students in Canada between December 2007 and June 2009. The final report of the survey, "Every Class in Every School",&lt;ref&gt;[http://egale.ca/youth-and-safer-schools/every-class/ Every Class in Every School] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806003134/http://egale.ca/youth-and-safer-schools/every-class/ |date=August 6, 2015 }}, Final Report on the First National Climate Survey on Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia in Canadian Schools, Egale Canada&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2011, found that 70% of all students participating heard "that's so gay" daily at school, and 48% of respondents heard "faggot", "lezbo" and "dyke" daily. 58% or about 1,400 of the 2,400 heterosexual students participating in EGALE's survey found homophobic comments upsetting. Further, EGALE found that students not directly affected by [[homophobia]], [[biphobia]] or [[transphobia]] were less aware of it. This finding relates to research done in the area of [[Empathy gap (social psychology)|empathy gaps for social pain]] which suggests that those not directly experiencing social pain (in this case, bullying) consistently underestimate its effects and thus may not adequately respond to the needs of one experiencing social pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nordgren |first1=L.

==== United Kingdom ====
About two-thirds of gay and lesbian students in [[Great Britain|British]] schools have suffered from gay bullying in 2007, according to a study done by the [[Schools Education Unit]] for [[LGBT]] activist group [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]]. Almost all that had been bullied had experienced verbal attacks, 41 percent had been physically attacked, and 17 percent had received death threats. It also showed that over 50% of teachers did not respond to homophobic language which they had explicitly heard in the classroom, and only 25% of schools had told their students that homophobic bullying was wrong, showing "a shocking picture of the extent of homophobic bullying undertaken by fellow pupils and, alarmingly, school staff",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=June 26, 2007 |title=Gay Bullying in Schools Common |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6239098.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; with further studies conducted by the same charity in 2012 stated that 90% of teachers had had no training on the prevention of homophobic bullying. However, Ofsted's new 2012 framework did ask schools what they would be doing in order to combat the issue.&lt;ref name="Stonewall1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Homophobic bullying |url=http://www.stonewall.org.uk/at_school/education_for_all/secondary_schools/homophobic_bullying/default.asp |access-date=December 25, 2014 |website=stonewall.org.uk |publisher=Stonewall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A research study of 78 eleven to fourteen-year-old boys conducted in twelve schools in London, England between 1998 and 1999&lt;ref name="Phoenix" /&gt; revealed that respondents who used the word "gay" to label another boy in a derogatory manner intended the word as "just a joke", "just a cuss" and not as a statement of one's perceived [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pascoe, C. J. (2007). Dude You're a Fag, Masculinity and Sexuality in High School. Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== United States ====
A 1998 study in the US by [[Mental Health America]] found that students heard anti-gay slurs such as "homo", "faggot" and "sissy" about 26 times a day on average, or once every 14 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mental Health American, Bullying and Gay Youth |url=http://www.nmha.org/go/information/get-info/children-s-mental-health/bullying-and-gay-youth |publisher=National Mental Health Association |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414144851/http://www.nmha.org/go/information/get-info/children-s-mental-health/bullying-and-gay-youth |archive-date=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, a union for UK professionals, the word "gay" was reported to be the most popular term of abuse heard by teachers on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How 'gay' Became Children's Insult of Choice|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7289390.stm|work=BBC News|date=2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
