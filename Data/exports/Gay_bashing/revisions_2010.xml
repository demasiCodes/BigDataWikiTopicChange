{{Discrimination sidebar}}'''''Gay bashing''''' is an expression used to designate verbal confrontation with, denigration of, or physical violence against people thought to be [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], or [[transgender]]ed ([[LGBT]]) because of their apparent [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]]. Similar terms such as "lesbian bashing" or "[[queer]] bashing" may also be formed. A "bashing" may be a specific incident, or one could also use the verb "to bash" e.g. "I was gay bashed." As there is no foolproof way to detect a person's sexual orientation, people sometimes fall victim even if they are not LGBT, should they be perceived to conform to the relevant [[stereotype]]s. 

A verbal gay bashing might use sexual slurs, expletives, intimidation, or threats of violence — or it might take place in a political forum and include one or more common [[anti-gay slogan]]s. Passionate invective fits more closely into the general idea of gay bashing than does a calm, intellectual justification for anti-LGBT attitudes or policies. However, some people{{Who|date=May 2009}} would include any expression of anti-LGBT sentiment in one or another category of "bashing".

The term can also be applied to non-verbal acts of homophobia although that application is less common.

{{worldwide}}

===United States===
Homophobia was especially serious in the late 1940s and early 1950s, when many gay people were forced out of government by boards set up by presidents [[Harry S. Truman]] and [[Dwight Eisenhower]]. As historian David K. Johnson explains:&lt;ref name="uchicago"&gt;[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/404811in.html University of Chicago Press: An interview with David K. Johnson]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Lavender Scare]] helped fan the flames of the [[Red Scare]]. In popular discourse, [[communist]]s and homosexuals were often conflated. Both groups were perceived as hidden [[subculture]]s with their own meeting places, literature, cultural codes, and bonds of loyalty. Both groups were thought to recruit to their ranks the psychologically weak or disturbed. And both groups were considered immoral and godless. Many people believed that the two groups were working together to undermine the government.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Johnson concludes that Senator [[Joe McCarthy]], notorious for his attacks on alleged Communists in government, was often pressured by his allies to denounce homosexuals in government, but he resisted and did not do so.&lt;ref name="uchicago" /&gt; Using rumors collected by [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]] one [[Nevada]] publisher wrote in 1952 that both McCarthy and his chief counsel, [[Roy Cohn]], were homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;After McCarthy called him an ex-Communist, [[Hank Greenspun]] wrote: "It is common talk among homosexuals in [[Milwaukee]] who rendezvous in the White Horse Inn that Senator Joe McCarthy has often engaged in homosexual activities." ''[[Las Vegas Sun]]'' October 25, 1952. McCarthy later explained he meant to call Greenspun an ex-convict (which was true), rather than an ex-Communist (which was false).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Washington Post]]'' editor [[Benjamin C. Bradlee]] said, "There was a lot of time spent investigating" these allegations, "although no one came close to proving it."  No reputable McCarthy biographer has accepted it as probable.&lt;ref&gt;The allegations are specifically rejected in Richard Rovere, ''Senator Joe McCarthy'' (1969), p. 68; see also Robert D. Dean, ''Imperial Brotherhood: Gender and the Making of Cold War Foreign Policy'' (2001) p. 149 (includes Bradlee quote); Kyle A. Cuordileone, ''Manhood and American Political Culture in the Cold War'' (2003), p. 94; Thomas Patrick Doherty, ''Cold War, Cool Medium: Television, McCarthyism, and American Culture,'' (2003), p. 228. Geoff Schumacher, ''Sun, Sin &amp; Suburbia: An Essential History of Modern Las Vegas'' (2004), p. 144, concludes, "Greenspun descended into mud-spewing rhetoric that would make the National Enquirer blanch."&lt;/ref&gt;
