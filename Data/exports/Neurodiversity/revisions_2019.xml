'''Neurodiversity''' is a neologism popularized in the late 1990s by Australian sociologist Judy Singer and American journalist Harvey Blume to refer to [[Genetic variation|variation]] in the [[human brain]] regarding [[Social behavior|sociability]], [[learning]], [[attention]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] and other [[Cognition|mental functions]] in a non-pathological sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/760085215|title=The power of neurodiversity : unleashing the advantages of your differently wired brain|last=Armstrong|first=Thomas|date=|publisher=Da Capo Lifelong|year=2011|isbn=9780738215242|edition=1st Da Capo Press paperback|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=|oclc=760085215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term emerged as a challenge to prevailing views that certain [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]s are [[Medical model of disability|inherently pathological]] and instead adopts the [[social model of disability]], in which [[Disability rights movement#Disability barriers|societal barriers]] are the main contributing factor that disables people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62326930|title=Social work with disabled people|last=Oliver, Michael, 1945-2019.|date=2006|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|others=Sapey, Bob.|isbn=1403918384|edition= 3rd|location=Basingstoke, Hampshire|oclc=62326930}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomsbury"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=PV95DwAAQBAJ|title=The Bloomsbury Companion to Philosophy of Psychiatry|last=Chapman|first=Robert|date=2019-01-10|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=|isbn=9781350024069|editor-last=Tekin|editor-first=Serife|location=|pages=371-387|language=en|chapter=Neurodiversity Theory and Its Discontents: Autism, Schizophrenia, and the Social Model of Disability|editor-last2=Bluhm|editor-first2=Robyn|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=PV95DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA371&amp;lpg=PA387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In a ''[[New York Times]]'' piece written by American journalist and writer Harvey Blume on June 30, 1997, Blume described the foundation of neurodiversity using the term "neurological pluralism".&lt;ref name="BlumeNYT"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E7DC1F31F933A05755C0A961958260|title=Autistics, freed from face-to-face encounters, are communicating in cyberspace|author=Blume|first=Harvey|date=1997-06-30|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2007-11-08|quote=Yet, in trying to come to terms with [a neurotypical-dominated] world, autistics are neither willing nor able to give up their own customs. Instead, they are proposing a new social compact, one emphasizing neurological pluralism. [...] The consensus emerging from the Internet forums and Web sites where autistics congregate [...] is that NT is only one of many neurological configurations -- the dominant one certainly, but not necessarily the best.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blume was an early advocate who predicted the role the Internet would play in fostering the international neurodiversity movement.&lt;ref name="BlumeMIT"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/m-i-t/articles/index_blume.html|title="Autism &amp; The Internet" or "It's The Wiring, Stupid"|author=Blume|first=Harvey|date=1997-07-01|website=Media In Transition|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=2007-11-08|quote=A project called CyberSpace 2000 is devoted to getting as many people as possible in the autistic spectrum hooked up by the year 2000, reason being that "the Internet is an essential means for autistic people to improve their lives, because it is often the only way they can communicate effectively."}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

The word neurodiversity is attributed to Judy Singer, an Australian [[Social science|social scientist]] on the [[autism spectrum]], who used the term in her sociology honors thesis published in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=nWTlAAAAQBAJ|title=Disability Discourse|last=Singer|first=Judy|date=1999-02-01|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (UK)|isbn=9780335202225|editor-last=Corker|editor-first=Mairian|location=|pages=59-67|language=en|chapter='Why can't you be normal for once in your life?'

"The Geneticization of Autism: From New Reproductive Technologies to the Conception of Genetic Normalcy." Signs 34.4 (2009): 875-99. ''Chicago Journals''. University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Singer had been in correspondence with Blume as a result of their mutual interest in autism, and though he did not credit Singer, the word first appeared in print in an article by Blume in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' on September 30, 1998.&lt;ref name="BlumeAtlantic"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199809u/neurodiversity|title=Neurodiversity|author=Blume, Harvey|date=September 30, 1998|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=November 7, 2007|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130105003900/http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199809u/neurodiversity|archive-date=January 5, 2013|url-status=dead|quote=Neurodiversity may be every bit as crucial for the human race as biodiversity is for life in general.

Sinclair was a principal early organizer of the international online autism community. Sinclair's 1993 speech, "Don't Mourn For Us", emphasized autism as a way of being: "It is not possible to separate the person from the autism."&lt;ref name="Sinclair"&gt;Sinclair, Jim.

The term "neurodiversity" has since been applied to other conditions and has taken on a more general meaning; for example, the Developmental Adult Neurodiversity Association (DANDA) in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] encompasses [[developmental coordination disorder]], [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], [[Asperger's syndrome]], and related conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danda.org.uk/ danda.org.uk]  DANDA website.

Proponents of neurodiversity strive to reconceptualize autism and related conditions in society by the following measures: acknowledging that neurodiversity does not require a cure; changing the language from the current "condition, disease, disorder, or illness"-based nomenclature and "broaden[ing] the understanding of healthy or independent living"; acknowledging new types of autonomy; and giving non-neurotypical individuals more control over their treatment, including the type, timing, and whether there should be treatment at all.&lt;ref name="article"&gt;Fenton, Andrew, and Tim Krahn.

They found that, although all of the students reported uniformly difficult schooling careers involving exclusion, abuse, and bullying, those who viewed themselves from a difference view (41% of the study cohort) "indicated higher academic self-esteem and confidence in their abilities and many (73%) expressed considerable career ambitions with positive and clear goals."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Many of these students reported gaining this view of themselves through contact with neurodiversity advocates in online support groups.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

A 2013 online survey, which aimed to assess conceptions of autism and neurodiversity, found that "a deficit-as-difference conception of autism suggests the importance of harnessing autistic traits in developmentally beneficial ways, transcending a false dichotomy between celebrating differences and ameliorating deficit."&lt;ref name="Kapp"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kapp|first=Steven K.|date=January 2013|title=Deficit, difference, or both?

==Controversy==
{{Further|Controversies in autism#Advocacy}}
The neurodiversity paradigm is controversial in autism advocacy.&lt;ref name="Jaarsma" /&gt; The dominant [[paradigm]] is one which [[Medical model of disability|pathologizes]] human brains that diverge from those considered typical. From this perspective, these brains have medical conditions which should be treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/exploringdiagnosis/files/2017/03/Adam-Feinstein-notes-for-neurodiversity-talk-for-Exeter-December-11-2017.pdf|title=Neurodiversity:  The cases for and against|last=Feinstein|first=Adam|date=Dec 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A common criticism is that the neurodiversity paradigm is too widely encompassing and that its conception should exclude those whose functioning is more severely impaired.&lt;ref name="Jaarsma" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=qEBLQ3hTJw4C|title=Autism: A Very Short Introduction|last=Frith|first=Uta|date=2008-10-23|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191578656|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autistic advocate and interdisciplinary educator Nick Walker, who has been credited with the most nuanced definition of the neurodiversity movement and the paradigm underlying it, says that neurodivergencies refer specifically to "pervasive neurocognitive differences" that are "intimately related to the formation and constitution of the self," in contrast to medical conditions such as [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref name="Bloomsbury" /&gt;
