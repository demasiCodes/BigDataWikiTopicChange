'''Neurodiversity''' refers to [[diversity]] in the [[human brain]] and [[cognition]], for instance in [[Social behavior|sociability]], [[learning]], [[attention]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] and other [[Cognition|mental functions]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The power of neurodiversity: unleashing the advantages of your differently wired brain|last=Armstrong|first=Thomas|publisher=Da Capo Lifelong|year=2011|isbn=9780738215242|edition=1st Da Capo Press paperback|location=Cambridge, MA|oclc=760085215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was coined in 1998 by sociologist Judy Singer, who helped popularize the concept along with journalist Harvey Blume,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and situates human cognitive variation in the context of [[biodiversity]] and the politics of [[minority group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reflections on the Neurodiversity Paradigm: What is Neurodiversity? |url=https://neurodiversity2.blogspot.com/p/what.html |access-date=2022-04-12 |website=Reflections on the Neurodiversity Paradigm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Singer |first=Judy |asin=B01HY0QTEE |title=NeuroDiversity: The Birth of an Idea |date=2016-07-03 |publisher=Judy Singer |edition=2nd |language=English}}{{sps|date=April 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view arose out of the [[autism rights movement]], as a challenge to prevailing views that certain things currently classified as [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]s are [[Medical model of disability|inherently pathological]]. It builds on the [[social model of disability]], in which disability arises out of [[Disability rights movement#Disability barriers|societal barriers]] interacting with individual differences, rather than people being disabled simply as a result of having impairments.

Some neurodiversity advocates and researchers, notably Judy Singer and Patrick Dwyer, argue that the neurodiversity paradigm is the middle ground between strong medical model and strong social model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/PDF/523723|format=PDF|journal=Human Development|date=2022|volume=66|title=The Neurodiversity Approach(es): What Are They and What Do They Mean for Researchers?|author=Patrick Dwyer|issue=2 |pages=73–92 |doi=10.1159/000523723 |pmid=36158596 |pmc=9261839 |s2cid=247062174 |access-date=24 July 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social work with disabled people|last=Oliver, Michael |date=2006|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|others=Sapey, Bob.|isbn=1403918384|edition= 3rd|location=Basingstoke, Hampshire|oclc=62326930}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomsbury"&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PV95DwAAQBAJ |title=The Bloomsbury Companion to Philosophy of Psychiatry |last=Chapman |first=Robert |date=January 10, 2019 |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=9781350024069 |editor-last=Tekin |editor-first=Serife |pages=371–387 |chapter=Neurodiversity Theory and Its Discontents: Autism, Schizophrenia, and the Social Model of Disability |editor-last2=Bluhm |editor-first2=Robyn |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PV95DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subsequent [[Controversies in autism#Neurodiversity paradigm|neurodiversity paradigm]] has been controversial among [[disability]] advocates, with [[Medical model of autism|opponents]] arguing it risks downplaying the suffering associated with some disabilities, and calls for the acceptance of things some would wish to see treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Opar |first1=Alisa |title=A medical condition or just a difference?

Autistic self-advocate and researcher [[Ari Ne'eman]], one of the major advocates in the neurodiversity movement, suggested a trait-based approach, meaning that elements of the medical (or pathology) model can be applied in treating certain traits, behaviors, or conditions that are intrinsically harmful (e.g. self-injury behaviors, speech-language impairments, or other co-occurring health conditions), whereas neurodiversity approaches can be applied to non-harmful or adaptive autistic traits (e.g. [[stimming]], intense interests) of the same individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/PDF/524277|journal=Human Development |date=2022|volume=66|pages=149–157|title=Neurodiversity as Politics|author1=Ari Ne’emana|author2=Elizabeth Pellicano|issue=2 |doi=10.1159/000524277 |s2cid=247829768 |access-date=24 July 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rasd.2021.101864 | doi=10.1016/j.rasd.2021.101864 | title="It feels like holding back something you need to say": Autistic and Non-Autistic Adults accounts of sensory experiences and stimming | year=2021 | last1=Charlton | first1=Rebecca A. | last2=Entecott | first2=Timothy | last3=Belova | first3=Evelina | last4=Nwaordu | first4=Gabrielle | journal=Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders | volume=89 | page=101864 | s2cid=240532683 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in recent years, there have been developments of neurodiversity-affirming interventions and reforms of some interventions.&lt;ref name="Neurodiversity Movement 2021"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Leadbitter |first1=Kathy |last2=Buckle |first2=Karen Leneh |last3=Ellis |first3=Ceri |last4=Dekker |first4=Martijn |date=2021 |title=Autistic Self-Advocacy and the Neurodiversity Movement: Implications for Autism Early Intervention Research and Practice |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=12 |page=635690 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2021.635690 |pmid=33912110|pmc=8075160 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/s10803-021-05316-x | title=Neurodiversity and Autism Intervention: Reconciling Perspectives Through a Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Intervention Framework | year=2021 | last1=Schuck | first1=Rachel K. | last2=Tagavi | first2=Daina M. | last3=Baiden | first3=Kaitlynn M.

Proponents of neurodiversity strive to reconceptualize autism and related conditions in society by the following measures: acknowledging that neurodiversity does not require a cure; changing the language from the current "condition, disease, disorder, or illness"-based nomenclature; "broadening the understanding of healthy or independent living"; acknowledging new types of autonomy; and giving non-neurotypical individuals more control over their treatment, including the type, timing, and whether there should be treatment at all.&lt;ref name="article"&gt;Fenton, Andrew, and Tim Krahn.

A 2009 study&lt;ref name="Griffin"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griffin|first=Edward|author2=Pollak, David|title=Student experiences of neurodiversity in higher education: Insights from the BRAINHE project.|journal=Dyslexia|date=January 2009|volume=15|issue=1|pages=23–41|pmid=19140120|doi=10.1002/dys.383}}&lt;/ref&gt; separated 27 students (with autism, dyslexia, developmental coordination disorder, ADHD, and stroke), into two categories of self-view: "A 'difference' view—where neurodiversity was seen as a difference incorporating a set of strengths and weaknesses, or a 'medical/deficit' view—where neurodiversity was seen as a disadvantageous medical condition." They found that, although all of the students reported uniformly difficult schooling careers involving exclusion, abuse, and bullying, those who viewed themselves from a different view (41% of the study cohort) "Indicated higher academic self-esteem and confidence in their abilities and many (73%) expressed considerable career ambitions with positive and clear goals."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Many of these students reported gaining this view of themselves through contact with neurodiversity advocates in online support groups.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

A 2013 online survey, which aimed to assess conceptions of autism and neurodiversity, found that "A deficit-as-difference conception of autism suggests the importance of harnessing autistic traits in developmentally beneficial ways, transcending a false dichotomy between celebrating differences and ameliorating deficit."&lt;ref name="Kapp"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kapp|first=Steven K.|date=January 2013|title=Deficit, difference, or both?

=== Neurodiversity and the Workplace ===
Neurodiverse individuals are subjected to bias when applying and interviewing for job positions.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Whelpley |first1=Christopher E. |last2=May |first2=Cynthia P. |date=2022-03-16 |title=Seeing is Disliking: Evidence of Bias Against Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Traditional Job Interviews |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-022-05432-2 |journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders |language=en |doi=10.1007/s10803-022-05432-2 |pmid=35294714 |s2cid=247498491 |issn=1573-3432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, neurodiverse individuals can have their social engagement style compared to neurotypical individuals, and it can affect their ability to obtain a job position.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Neurodiversity stigmas, especially against autistic individuals, and cognition challenges in social situations can hinder an individual's ability to perform well in a traditional job interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Willis |first1=Colin |last2=Powell-Rudy |first2=Tracy |last3=Colley |first3=Kelsie |last4=Prasad |first4=Joshua |date=December 2021 |title=Examining the Use of Game-Based Assessments for Hiring Autistic Job Seekers |journal=Journal of Intelligence |language=en |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=53 |doi=10.3390/jintelligence9040053 |issn=2079-3200 |pmc=8628896 |pmid=34842751|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once in the workplace, neurodiverse employees continue to run into barriers. In a [[systematic review]] that considered developmental dyslexia (DD) as "an expression of neurodiversity," it was suggested that neurodiversity is not yet an established concept in the workplace, and therefore, support from social relationships and work accommodations is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=de Beer |first1=Joost |last2=Heerkens |first2=Yvonne |last3=Engels |first3=Josephine |last4=van der Klink |first4=Jac |date=2022-05-31 |title=Factors relevant to work participation from the perspective of adults with developmental dyslexia: a systematic review of qualitative studies |url=https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13436-x |journal=BMC Public Health |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=1083 |doi=10.1186/s12889-022-13436-x |issn=1471-2458 |pmc=9158268 |pmid=35642026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, another systematic review that focused on intervention studies for supporting adults with [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)]] discovered that there were few workplace-based intervention studies.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Lauder |first1=Kirsty |last2=McDowall |first2=Almuth |last3=Tenenbaum |first3=Harriet R. |date=2022 |title=A systematic review of interventions to support adults with ADHD at work—Implications from the paucity of context-specific research for theory and practice |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=13 |page=893469 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2022.893469 |issn=1664-1078 |pmc=9443814 |pmid=36072032|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The covered studies mainly assessed [[pharmacological]] and combined (pharmacological and [[psychosocial]]) interventions.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Additional research needs to be conducted to figure out how to best support neurodiverse employees in the workplace.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

When the COVID-19 pandemic occurred, remote work became more common, and researchers like Yael Goldfarb began looking into digital transitions and the implications for employees with autism.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Goldfarb |first1=Yael |last2=Gal |first2=Eynat |last3=Golan |first3=Ofer |date=2022-01-01 |title=Implications of Employment Changes Caused by COVID-19 on Mental Health and Work-Related Psychological Need Satisfaction of Autistic Employees: A Mixed-Methods Longitudinal Study |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-021-04902-3 |journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders |language=en |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=89–102 |doi=10.1007/s10803-021-04902-3 |issn=1573-3432 |pmc=7908957 |pmid=33635422}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldfarb's study suggested that these individuals would benefit more from remote work as it allowed them to engage in their interests, but social engagement is still necessary for productivity and performance.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Another study that assessed remote work employees with autism supported Goldfarb's findings and stressed the need for redesigned work and social conditions to be more inclusive for individuals with autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Tomczak |first1=Michał T. |last2=Mpofu |first2=Elias |last3=Hutson |first3=Nathan |date=January 2022 |title=Remote Work Support Needs of Employees with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Poland: Perspectives of Individuals with Autism and Their Coworkers |journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health |language=en |volume=19 |issue=17 |pages=10982 |doi=10.3390/ijerph191710982 |issn=1660-4601 |pmc=9518488 |pmid=36078696|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
{{Further|Controversies in autism#Advocacy initiatives}}
The neurodiversity paradigm is controversial in autism advocacy.&lt;ref name="Jaarsma" /&gt; The dominant [[paradigm]] is one which [[Medical model of disability|pathologizes]] human brains that diverge from those considered typical. From this perspective, these brains have medical conditions which should be treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/exploringdiagnosis/files/2017/03/Adam-Feinstein-notes-for-neurodiversity-talk-for-Exeter-December-11-2017.pdf|title=Neurodiversity: The cases for and against|last=Feinstein|first=Adam|date=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common criticism is that the neurodiversity paradigm is too widely encompassing and that its conception should exclude those whose functioning is more severely impaired.&lt;ref name="Jaarsma" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qEBLQ3hTJw4C|title=Autism: A Very Short Introduction|last=Frith|first=Uta|date=October 23, 2008|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191578656|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autistic advocate and interdisciplinary educator Nick Walker offers the distinction that neurodivergences refer specifically to "pervasive neurocognitive differences" that are "intimately related to the formation and constitution of the self," in contrast to medical conditions such as [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref name="Bloomsbury" /&gt;

Neurodiversity advocate [[John Elder Robison]] argues that the disabilities and strengths conferred by neurological differences may be mutually inseparable. "When 99 neurologically identical people fail to solve a problem, it's often the 1% fellow who's different who holds the key. Yet that person may be disabled or disadvantaged most or all of the time. To neurodiversity proponents, people are disabled because they are at the edges of the bell curve, not because they are sick or broken."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Neurodiversity?|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/my-life-aspergers/201310/what-is-neurodiversity|access-date=September 17, 2020|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Critiques of the Neurodiversity Movement", a 2020 review, argued two basic observations:
* Many people who do not have an autism diagnosis have autistic traits. This was known by researchers as the "broader autism phenotype". So, there was no clear bimodal distribution separating people with and without autism. In reality there were not two distinct populations, one "neurotypical" and one "neurodivergent".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Ginny |title=Autistic community and the neurodiversity movement: stories from the frontline |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2020 |isbn=978-981-13-8437-0 |editor-last=Kapp |editor-first=Steven |location=Singapore |pages=287–303 |chapter=Critiques of the Neurodiversity Movement |doi=10.1007/978-981-13-8437-0_21 |oclc=1127055276 |chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-981-13-8437-0_21.pdf |s2cid=210483688}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Neurotypical" was a dubious construct, because there was nobody who could be considered truly neurotypical. There was no such standard for the human brain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== In the media ==
The increase of representation of the neurodiversity movement in the media came about with changes in the technology of the media platforms themselves.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Leadbitter |first1=Kathy |last2=Buckle |first2=Karen Leneh |last3=Ellis |first3=Ceri |last4=Dekker |first4=Martijn |date=2021 |title=Autistic Self-Advocacy and the Neurodiversity Movement: Implications for Autism Early Intervention Research and Practice |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=12 |page=635690 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2021.635690 |pmid=33912110 |pmc=8075160 |issn=1664-1078|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The recent addition of text-based options on various social media sites allow disabled users to communicate, enjoy, and share at a more accessible rate.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Social media]] has a two-fold benefit to the neurodiverse community. It can help spread awareness and pioneer the neurodiversity movement, and it can also allow members of the communities themselves to connect.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Wang |first1=Tao |chapter=Benefits and Challenges for Social Media Users on the Autism Spectrum |date=2020-10-17 |book-title=Conference Companion Publication of the 2020 on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing |pages=419–424 |location=New York |publisher=Association for Computing Machinery |doi=10.1145/3406865.3418322 |isbn=978-1-4503-8059-1 |last2=Garfield |first2=Monica |last3=Wisniewski |first3=Pamela |last4=Page |first4=Xinru|title=Conference Companion Publication of the 2020 on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Gabarron |first1=Elia |last2=Dechsling |first2=Anders |last3=Skafle |first3=Ingjerd |last4=Nordahl-Hansen |first4=Anders |date=2022-03-07 |title=Discussions of Asperger Syndrome on Social Media: Content and Sentiment Analysis on Twitter |journal=JMIR Formative Research |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=e32752 |doi=10.2196/32752 |issn=2561-326X |pmc=8938830 |pmid=35254265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social media as connecting platform ===
Media platforms allow the connection of individuals of similar backgrounds to find a community of support with one another.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; Online networking and connections allows for the user to decide their level of comfort with interactions, and allow them to retain control of a relationship with another user. For the neurodiverse community, the use of social media to create relationships has proven a useful tool for those with difficulty in social situations.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Brownlow |first1=Charlotte |last2=Rosqvist |first2=Hanna Bertilsdotter |last3=O'Dell |first3=Lindsay |date=2015-11-02 |title=Exploring the potential for social networking among people with autism: challenging dominant ideas of 'friendship' |url=http://www.sjdr.se/articles/10.1080/15017419.2013.859174/ |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Disability Research |language=en |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=188–193 |doi=10.1080/15017419.2013.859174 |issn=1745-3011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By connecting neurodiverse users, media platforms are to provide 'safe spaces' that is helpful in the making of relationships.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Some media developers, such as Divyanka Kapoor, have taken a step further and created platforms such as "Blossom" which are designed specifically to connect neurodiverse users and families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2022-01-26 |title=Blossom: An App for the Neurodiverse Community |url=https://mittalsouthasiainstitute.harvard.edu/2022/01/blossom-app/ |access-date=2022-04-11 |website=The Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Platforms such a Blossom remove the external pressure for neurotypical users and allow the neurodiverse community to seek security and familiarity within a platform built especially for them.

=== Social media as a driving force ===
Another way in which media has the potential to benefit the neurodiverse community is by allowing users (especially popular influencers) to spread awareness about the [[Autism rights movement|neurodiversity movement]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Calhoun |first1=Amanda J. |last2=Gold |first2=Jessica A. |date=2020-04-01 |title="I Feel Like I Know Them": the Positive Effect of Celebrity Self-disclosure of Mental Illness |journal=Academic Psychiatry |language=en |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=237–241 |doi=10.1007/s40596-020-01200-5 |pmid=32100256 |s2cid=211479198 |issn=1545-7230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing awareness about disorders, especially those often debated by non-experts such as neurodiversity, has shown to increase the amount of factual information spread.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The spread of information through social media exposure can assist the neurodiversity movement in educating the public about understanding disabilities such as [[autism]] and sifting out misinformation.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; By sharing neurodiverse experiences from a first hand perspective, media influencers have power to educate the public as well as destigmatize certain disorders.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As negative portrayals of neurodiversity have an obstructive impact on members the community, changing the narrative through social media exposure is a tool the ND community is employing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Stuart |first=Heather |date=2006-02-01 |title=Media Portrayal of Mental Illness and its Treatments |journal=CNS Drugs |language=en |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=99–106 |doi=10.2165/00023210-200620020-00002 |pmid=16478286 |s2cid=21633246 |issn=1179-1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Challenges within media ===
Although representation of the neurodiverse community has grown with the help of social media platforms, those users are often criticized and misunderstood.&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bitman |first=Nomy |date=February 11, 2022 |title="Authentic" digital inclusion? Dis/ability performances on social media by users with concealable communicative disabilities |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14614448211063183 |journal=New Media and Society |language=en |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=401–419 |doi=10.1177/14614448211063183 |s2cid=246777065 |issn=1461-4448 |via=Sage Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media has not removed the social barriers that restrict inclusion of neurodiverse peoples. The persisting barriers in social media are deeper than the issues of accessibility. Neurodiverse users are reported to be limited to their platform to conform to the mainstream view of their disability to be seen as "authentic" users.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; The push for "authentic" users on the internet has grown with the use of social media itself. While the premise of sifting through ingenuine users was not a broach to the ND community, it has indirectly made it more difficult for neurodiverse users to grow platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Salisbury |first1=Meredith |last2=Pooley |first2=Jefferson |date=2017-01-20 |title=The #nofilter Self: The Contest for Authenticity among Social Networking Sites, 2002–2016 |journal=Social Sciences |language=en |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=10 |doi=10.3390/socsci6010010 |issn=2076-0760 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; This issue of non-disabled users evaluating the authenticity of a neurodiverse user based on stereotypes shows the battle that the neurodiversity movement has not reached its goal of inclusion.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;
