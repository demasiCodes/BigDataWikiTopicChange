==History==
{{Expand section|date=September 2011}}

Neurological diversity is an accepted phenomenon in the animal kingdom.&lt;ref name='Baker 2011'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Baker | first1 = Dana Lee | title = The Politics of Neurodiversity: Why Public Policy Matters | publisher = Lynne Rienner Publishers | year = 2011 | accessdate = 2011-09-04 | isbn = 978-1588267542}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2011}}

The concept of neurodiversity in humans was initially embraced by some [[autism|autistic]] individuals and people with [[Autism spectrum|related conditions]]. Subsequent groups sought to apply the concept of neurodiversity to conditions unrelated (or non-[[wiktionary:concomitant|concomitant]]) to autism such as [[bipolar disorder]], [[ADHD]],&lt;ref name=Woodford&gt;Woodford, Gillian.

==Etymology==
According to an article in ''[[New York Magazine]]'', the term was put forward by [[Judy Singer]] and first published by Harvey Blume.&lt;ref name=Solomon&gt;{{Cite news|last=Solomon |first=Andrew |title=The Autism Rights Movement |date=2008-05-25 | work=New York Magazine | url=http://nymag.com/news/features/47225/ |accessdate=2008-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest published use of the term appears in a ''New York Times'' article by Harvey Blume on September 30, 1998:&lt;ref name=BlumeAtlantic&gt;{{Cite news|author= Blume, Harvey |url= http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199809u/neurodiversity |title= Neurodiversity |work= The Atlantic |date= September 30, 1998 |accessdate= 2007-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote| Neurodiversity may be every bit as crucial for the human race as biodiversity is for life in general. Who can say what form of wiring will prove best at any given moment? Cybernetics and computer culture, for example, may favor a somewhat autistic cast of mind.}}

Previous to this, although Blume did not make explicit use of the term ''neurodiversity'', he wrote in a ''New York Times'' piece on June 30, 1997:&lt;ref name=BlumeNYT&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E7DC1F31F933A05755C0A961958260|author=Blume, Harvey|title=Autistics, freed from face-to-face encounters, are communicating in cyberspace|work=The New York Times|date=June 30, 1997|accessdate=2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|Yet anyone who explores the subject on the Internet quickly discovers an altogether different side of autism. In cyberspace, many of the nation's autistics are doing the very thing the syndrome supposedly deters them from doing -- communicating.

Yet, in trying to come to terms with an NT[&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[neurotypical]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;]-dominated world, autistics are neither willing nor able to give up their own customs. Instead, they are proposing a new social compact, one emphasizing neurological pluralism.

The consensus emerging from the Internet forums and Web sites where autistics congregate (...) is that NT is only one of many neurological configurations -- the dominant one certainly, but not necessarily the best.}}

Blume is also notable for his early public advocacy and prediction of the role the internet would play in fostering neurodiversity.&lt;ref name=BlumeMIT&gt;{{Cite web|author=Blume, Harvey|url=http://web.mit.edu/m-i-t/articles/index_blume.html|title="Autism &amp; The Internet" or "It's The Wiring, Stupid"|date=July 1, 1997|publisher=Media In Transition, Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|There is a political dimension to this bond with the Internet. A project called CyberSpace 2000 is devoted to getting as many people as possible in the autistic spectrum hooked up by the year 2000, reason being that "the Internet is an essential means for autistic people to improve their lives, because it is often the only way they can communicate effectively."

[ ... ] the community of autistics, which may not have matured and come to self-awareness without the Internet, presents the rest of us with a challenge.

The challenge we will all be increasingly confronted with, on-line and off, is, to look at ourselves differently than we have before, that is, to accept neurological diversity.}}

Previously, the term mostly appeared within the online [[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism|autistic community]], but its usage has spread to a more general meaning; for example, the [[Developmental Adult Neurodiversity Association]] (DANDA) in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] encompasses [[developmental dyspraxia]], [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], [[Asperger syndrome]] and related conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danda.org.uk/ Home page.]  DANDA.  Retrieved on 2007-11-08&lt;/ref&gt;  Usage of the term has seen a boost with a 2004 ''New York Times'' article by Amy Harmon, "The Disability Movement Turns to Brains".&lt;ref name=Movement&gt;Harmon, Amy. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9C07E0D9143CF93AA35756C0A9629C8B63 Neurodiversity Forever; The Disability Movement Turns to Brains.] ''The New York Times'', May 9, 2004.

==Society and culture==
===Debate===
;Neurodiversity as an ideology
The language surrounding neurodiversity has been a major point of contention. Those proposing the medical model label learning differences as “disorders, deficits, and dysfunctions.” From this point of view, neurodiverse states are viewed as medical conditions that can and should be corrected.&lt;ref name="Pollak"&gt;Pollak, David. 2009. “Neurodiversity in Higher Education.” John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Others{{Who|date=September 2010}} see neurodiversity as an inclusive term that refers to the equality of all possible mental states. Still others reject the word because it sounds too medical and overshadows the needs of people with learning differences.&lt;ref name="Pollak"/&gt;

Neurodiversity was prefigured by the work of French historian and theorist [[Michel Foucault]], whose book ''Folie et déraison'' ("Madness and unreason"; published in an abridged version in English as ''[[Madness and Civilization]]'', and eventually in full as ''The History of Madness'') influenced the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement of the 1960s.{{Or|date=October 2011}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Neurodiversity as a term captures the discovery that autism has an organic basis, representing a move away from the "mother-blaming" theories of the 20th century. Before the scientific advances in the 1980s, autism scholars including [[Bruno Bettelheim]] popularized the belief that autism came from "extremely abnormal mother-child relations". Bettelheim, a researcher and author of books about autism, pioneered the "refrigerator-mother" idea, claiming that cold, distant parenting was a cause of autism. Though Bettelheim later admitted to falsifying his credentials{{Request quotation|date=October 2011}}, the stigma remained until recent genetic research debunked this myth.&lt;ref name="genetics"&gt;Bumiller, Kristen. "The Geneticization of Autism: From New Reproductive Technologies to the Conception of Genetic Normalcy." Signs 34.4 (2009): 875-99. ''Chicago Journals''. University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of autism is contested and could result from a variety of factors that are genetic, biological, or environmental in nature; the shift is that the basis of autism is no longer believed to be entirely social. The post-1980 geneticization of autism, wherein the condition is said to have an organic basis, was a change that prompted the idea of neurodiversity, with autism able to be accepted as a natural difference in individuals. &lt;ref name="genetics"/&gt;

Autism diagnoses have increased; though the causes are disputed, ranging from childhood mercury poisoning to increased healthcare to non-uniform standards of diagnosis, there has been an undeniable growth of the diagnosed autistic population.&lt;ref name="baker"&gt;Baker, Dana. "Neurodiversity, Neurological Disability, and the Public Sector: Notes on the Autism Spectrum." ''Disability &amp; Society'' 21.1 (2006): 15-29. EBSCOhost. Web. 10  November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Public attention has grown to match this rise,{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} with articles in ''[[Newsweek]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' showcasing new research, in turn bringing autism, and, to a lesser extent, neurodiversity, more attention from leading elements in politics and contemporary culture.

;Goals of the neurodiversity movement
Proponents of neurodiversity are striving to re-conceptualize autism and related conditions in society. Main goals of the movement include:
*acknowledging that neurodiverse people do not need a cure
*changing the language from the current “condition, disease, disorder, or illness”-based nomenclature
*broadening the understanding of healthy or independent living; acknowledging new types of autonomy
*giving neurodiverse individuals more control over their treatment, including the type, timing, and whether there should be treatment at all&lt;ref name="article"&gt;Fenton, Andrew, and Tim Krahn. "Autism, Neurodiversity and Equality Beyond the Normal." Journal of Ethics in Mental Health 2.2 (2007): 1-6. Web. 10  November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
Autistic supporters of neurodiversity want their way of life to be considered as a respectable, autonomous, and equal way of living. Since autism is inseparable from daily perceptions and decisions, some believe it ought not be separated from the person and treated as a curable disease. Rather, autism should be recognized as a different but equal way of understanding and approaching the world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Proponents of neurodiversity are typically not opposed to medical treatments, but they believe that it should be up to the individual and be seen as aiding in the enjoyment of life rather than "fixing" a person.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Some parents say they value their children's individuality and want to allow their children to develop naturally. For example, [[Morton Ann Gernsbacher]] is a parent of an autistic child and a psychology professor, who argues that autistics need acceptance, not a cure, and endorses the theory that autism cannot be separated from the person.&lt;ref&gt;Gernsbacher, Morton Ann. [http://www.autistics.org/library/acceptance.html "Autistics Need Acceptance, Not Cure".] autistics.org, April 24, 2004. Retrieved on 2 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
