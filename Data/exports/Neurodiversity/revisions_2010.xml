'''Neurodiversity''' is an idea which asserts that atypical (neurodivergent) [[neurology|neurological]] development is a normal human difference that is to be recognized and respected as any other human variation.&lt;ref name=Movement/&gt;  Differences may arise in ways of processing information, including language, sound, images, light, texture, taste, or movement. The concept of neurodiversity is embraced by some [[autism|autistic]] individuals and people with [[Autism spectrum|related conditions]]. Some groups apply the concept of neurodiversity to conditions potentially unrelated (or non-[[wiktionary:concomitant|concomitant]]) to autism such as [[bipolar disorder]], [[ADHD]],&lt;ref name=Woodford&gt;Woodford, Gillian.

==Origin of the term==
According to an article in ''[[New York Magazine]]'', the term was put forward by [[Judy Singer]] and first published by Harvey Blume.&lt;ref name=Solomon&gt;{{Cite news|last=Solomon |first=Andrew |title=The Autism Rights Movement |date=2008-05-25 | work=New York Magazine | url=http://nymag.com/news/features/47225/ |accessdate=2008-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest published use of the term appears in a ''New York Times'' article by Harvey Blume on September 30, 1998:&lt;ref name=BlumeAtlantic&gt;{{Cite news|author= Blume, Harvey |url= http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199809u/neurodiversity |title= Neurodiversity |work= The Atlantic |date= September 30, 1998 |accessdate= 2007-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote| Neurodiversity may be every bit as crucial for the human race as biodiversity is for life in general. Who can say what form of wiring will prove best at any given moment? Cybernetics and computer culture, for example, may favor a somewhat autistic cast of mind.}}

Previous to this, although Blume did not make explicit use of the term ''Neurodiversity'', he wrote in a ''New York Times'' piece on June 30, 1997:&lt;ref name=BlumeNYT&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E7DC1F31F933A05755C0A961958260|author=Blume, Harvey|title=Autistics, freed from face-to-face encounters, are communicating in cyberspace|work=The New York Times|date=June 30, 1997|accessdate=2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|Yet anyone who explores the subject on the Internet quickly discovers an altogether different side of autism. In cyberspace, many of the nation's autistics are doing the very thing the syndrome supposedly deters them from doing -- communicating.

Yet, in trying to come to terms with an [[neurotypical|NT]]-dominated world, autistics are neither willing nor able to give up their own customs. Instead, they are proposing a new social compact, one emphasizing neurological pluralism.

The consensus emerging from the Internet forums and Web sites where autistics congregate (...) is that NT is only one of many neurological configurations -- the dominant one certainly, but not necessarily the best.}}

Blume is also notable for his early public advocacy and prediction of the role the internet would play in fostering neurodiversity.&lt;ref name=BlumeMIT&gt;{{Cite web|author=Blume, Harvey|url=http://web.mit.edu/m-i-t/articles/index_blume.html|title="Autism &amp; The Internet" or "It's The Wiring, Stupid"|date=July 1, 1997|publisher=Media In Transition, Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|There is a political dimension to this bond with the Internet. A project called CyberSpace 2000 is devoted to getting as many people as possible in the autistic spectrum hooked up by the year 2000, reason being that "the Internet is an essential means for autistic people to improve their lives, because it is often the only way they can communicate effectively."

[ ... ] the community of autistics, which may not have matured and come to self-awareness without the Internet, presents the rest of us with a challenge.

The challenge we will all be increasingly confronted with, on-line and off, is, to look at ourselves differently than we have before, that is, to accept neurological diversity.}}

The term mostly appears within the online [[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism|autistic community]], but its usage has spread to a more general meaning; for example, the [[Developmental Adult Neurodiversity Association]] (DANDA) in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] encompasses [[developmental dyspraxia]], [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], [[Asperger syndrome]] and related conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danda.org.uk/ Home page.]  DANDA.  Retrieved on 2007-11-08&lt;/ref&gt;  Usage of the term has seen a boost with a 2004 ''New York Times'' article by Amy Harmon, "The Disability Movement Turns to Brains".&lt;ref name=Movement&gt;Harmon, Amy. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9C07E0D9143CF93AA35756C0A9629C8B63 Neurodiversity Forever; The Disability Movement Turns to Brains.] ''The New York Times'', May 9, 2004.

==Neurodiversity as an ideology==
The language surrounding neurodiversity has been a major point of contention. Those proposing the medical model label learning differences as “disorders, deficits, and disfunctions.” From this point of view, neurodiverse states are viewed as medical conditions that can and should be corrected.&lt;ref name="Pollak"&gt;Pollak, David. 2009. “Neurodiversity in Higher Education.” John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Others{{Who|date=September 2010}} see neurodiversity as an inclusive term that refers to the equality of all possible mental states. Still others reject the word because it sounds too medical and overshadows the needs of people with learning differences.&lt;ref name="Pollak"/&gt;

The idea that there are "normal" people and "not normal" people is being challenged by more recent research in psychology. Many psychological disorders are spectrum disorders, including Autism, meaning that people with varying degrees of symptoms will be placed at different spots on a theoretical spectrum, but be given the same broad diagnosis. One of the common symptoms in individuals with Autism is having high interest in a narrow subject, but taken loosely, nearly everyone could be described this way. How to determine where the spectrum should end, where on one side an individual is termed "normal" and the other "not normal", is often difficult to say. In contrast to trying to classify humans into discrete categories, the neurodiversity movement views each human as unique and supports the expression of it.

Neurodiversity as a word does capture the discovery that autism has a biological basis, representing a move away from the “mother-blaming” theories of the 20th century. Before the scientific advances in the 1980s, autism scholars including [[Bruno Bettelheim]] popularized the belief that autism came from “extremely abnormal mother-child relations.” Bettelheim, a researcher and author of many books about autism, pioneered the "refrigerator-mother" idea, saying the cold and distant parenting was a cause of autism. Though Bettelheim later admitted to falsifying his credentials, the stigma remained until recent genetic research debunked this myth.&lt;ref name="genetics"&gt;Bumiller, Kristen. "The Geneticization of Autism: From New Reproductive Technologies to the Conception of Genetic Normalcy." Signs 34.4 (2009): 875-99. Chicago Journals. University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-1980 geneticization of autism, wherein the condition is said to have a biological basis, was a change that prompted the idea of neurodiversity. Since the condition is innate, it is able to be accepted as a natural difference in individuals. It is important to note that the true cause of autism is contested and could result from a variety of factors that are genetic, biological, or environmental in nature. The important shift is that the basis of autism is no longer believed to be entirely social.&lt;ref name="genetics"/&gt;

There has been a large increase in the number of autism diagnoses in the past few decades. Though the cause of this “autism baby boom” are disputed, ranging from childhood mercury poisoning to increased healthcare to different standards of diagnosis, there has been an undeniable growth of the diagnosed autistic population.&lt;ref name="baker"&gt;Baker, Dana. "Neurodiversity, neurological disability and the public sector: notes on the autism spectrum." Disability &amp; Society 21.1 (2006): 15-29. EBSCOhost. Web. 10  November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Public attention has grown to match this rise, with articles in ''[[Newsweek]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' to showcase new research. This has brought autism, and, to a lesser extent, neurodiversity, more attention from leading elements in politics and contemporary culture.

==Goals of the neurodiversity movement==
Proponents of neurodiversity are striving to re-conceptualize autism and related conditions in society. Main goals of the movement include:
*acknowledging that neurodiverse people do not need a cure
*changing the language from the current “condition, disease, disorder, or illness”-based nomenclature
*broadening the understanding of healthy or independent living; acknowledging new types of autonomy
*giving neurodiverse individuals more control over their treatment, including the type, timing, and whether there should be treatment at all&lt;ref name="article"&gt;Fenton, Andrew, and Tim Krahn. "Autism, Neurodiversity and Equality Beyond the Normal." Journal of Ethics in Mental Health 2.2 (2007): 1-6. Web. 10  November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
Autistic supporters of neurodiversity want their way of life to be considered as a respectable, autonomous, and equal way of living. Since autism is inseparable from daily perceptions and decisions, some believe it ought not be separated from the person and treated as a curable disease. Rather, autism should be recognized as a different but equal way of understanding and approaching the world.

Proponents of neurodiversity are typically not opposed to medical treatments, but they believe that it should be up to the individual and be seen as aiding in the enjoyment of life rather than "fixing" a person.

==Legislation and its implications==
In 1990, President [[George H.W. Bush]] signed the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] into law. This act prohibited discrimination based on disability in schools, the workplace, and other public institutions.

In 1995, the United Kingdom passed the [[Disability Discrimination Act]], making it illegal to deny people employment, goods and services, education, or transportation based on disability.

Both countries were required to anticipate and make "reasonable adjustments" for people with disabilities. Some of these adjustments were outlined under the Disability Equality Duty (a provision under the Americans with Disabilities Act):

*promote equality of opportunity
*eliminate unlawful discrimination
*eliminate harassment of disabled persons that is related to their disabilities
*promote positive attitudes towards disabled persons
*encourage participation by disabled persons in public life
*take steps to take account of disabled persons' disabilities&lt;ref name="james"&gt;Palfreman-Kay, James. "Institutional policy and neurodiversity in the post-16 sector." Google. Web. 26  November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

These changes have brought increasing participation by neurodiverse people in both countries. The numbers of neurodiverse students in higher education have increased tenfold in both the US and the UK since their respective anti-discrimination acts have been passed,&lt;ref name="Pollak"/&gt; though the rate of autism diagnosis has quintupled in the same period of time.

==Proponents and opponents==
Neurodiversity was prefigured by the work of French historian and theorist [[Michel Foucault]], whose book ''Folie et déraison'' ("Madness and unreason"; published in an abridged version in English as ''[[Madness and Civilization]]'', and eventually in full as ''The History of Madness'') influenced the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement of the 1960s.

Many supporters of neurodiversity are anti-cure autistics,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} who are engaged in advocacy; some parents of autistic children also support neurodiversity. Such parents say they value their children's individuality and want to allow their children to develop naturally. For example, [[Morton Ann Gernsbacher]] is a parent of an autistic child and a psychology professor, who argues that autistics need acceptance, not a cure, and endorses the theory that autism cannot be separated from the person.&lt;ref&gt;Gernsbacher, Morton Ann. [http://www.autistics.org/library/acceptance.html "Autistics Need Acceptance, Not Cure".] autistics.org, April 24, 2004. Retrieved on 2 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the line between proponents and opponents to the neurodiversity movement is blurred. Though its primary function is to provide advocacy and fundraising for biomedical research, [[Autism Speaks]] is considered to be an opponent of neurodiversity. Supporters of neurodiversity fear that the research and rhetoric of Autism Speaks will inevitably lead to [[eugenic]]s implications. Many of Autism Speaks' ad campaigns suggest that a child diagnosed with autism is a "preventable tragedy," since [[genetic counseling]] could eliminate autism from the gene pool one child at a time. However, since there is no single “autism gene,” attempting to control autism genetically would potentially eliminate many characteristics associated with autism. Supporters of neurodiversity argue that all of these characteristics are not meant to be genetically hidden.&lt;ref name="genetics"/&gt;

==Neurodiversity and the classroom==
Unfortunately, labeling children with a disorder that requires special education is a paradox.  On one hand, this labeling helps children get the extra attention and focus that they need.  On the other, they are stifled and ridiculed because of their label. This paradox alludes to the connection between human rights and education.{{Or|date=September 2010}}

Placing children in special education when it is not necessary may be detrimental to a child’s right to education. Often children who are neurologically diverse are placed in special education classrooms as they are considered ‘disruptive’ to the standard classroom environment. Consequently, ADHD children who are capable of performing at the age appropriate level are removed from the standard classroom and placed into a special education class.  Some studies argue that if a child is removed from the regular classroom when it is not necessary, the child is losing his/her access to the general curriculum that provides more necessary academic skills, a learning environment that fosters civic and social participation, and an environment that encourages academic rigor. The caliber of educational standards is not expected to be as high as those established in a “normal” classroom setting. The hegemony of neuronormalcy tethers the standard pedagogy and classroom setting to a to the expectation that "neurologically non-normative" students be secluded to a different educational setting.  It is difficult to say, however, what these critics suggest for a better solution for educating these students with particular learning needs.  The paradox that subsequently follows is how to allow neurologically diverse students to participate in a system that has been structured specifically for a “neurologically normal” community.{{Or|date=September 2010}}{{Request quotation|date=September 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;Keefe, E., Moore, V., &amp; Duff, F. (2006). Listening to the experts: students with disabilites speak out. Baltimore: Paul H. Brookes Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==“Backdoor eugenics” controversy==
With all of the recent biomedical advances, a controversy has arisen that is closely related to the neurodiversity movement. The commonality of genetic counseling before or during pregnancy may create a choice between a “normal” child and a “disabled” one. Although this is not outright [[eugenics]]-style elimination of a segment of the population, this could result in a hushed, "backdoor" form of eugenics in which parents are able to choose whether to bear a child with a disability. In a utilitarian society, there is no choice: disabled people are undeniably “more costly and less productive.”&lt;ref name="genetics"/&gt; Sympathetic parents also worry that a disabled child would be subject to social isolation and limited opportunities. Whether a choice about disability status should be made based on any grounds is debated between supporters of the biomedical perspective and supporters of neurodiversity.

Supporters of the biomedical perspective believe that citizens have the responsibility to improve the health and welfare of their societies.  Embryo selection has been proposed as a way to improve the health of society. Since those with so-called “low-functioning” autism are a drain on resources and may not be able to enjoy a “normal” life, genetic screening could be used as a preventative measure.&lt;ref name="genetics"/&gt;

On the other hand, supporters of neurodiversity see embryo selection as a threat to their way of life and even a personal attack, perceiving that proponents of genetic screening would rather neurodiverse people had not been born. Neurodiversity activists see the tendency toward embryo selection as a devaluation of those with autism and related conditions. Genetic screening is on the rise with parents-to-be. People with disabilities already fear they will be increasingly economically, socially, and politically marginalized due to this potential move to eliminate disabilities from the population.&lt;ref name="genetics"/&gt;
