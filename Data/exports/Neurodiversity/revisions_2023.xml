'''Neurodiversity''' is a framework for understanding [[human brain]] function and [[mental illness]]. It argues that diversity in human [[cognition]] is normal and that some conditions classified as mental disorders are differences and disabilities that are not necessarily [[Medical model of disability|pathological]]. 

The framework grew out of the [[autism rights movement]] and builds on the [[social model of disability]], arguing that disability partly arises from [[Disability rights movement#Disability barriers|societal barriers]], rather than attributing disability purely to inherent deficits. It instead situates human cognitive variation in the context of [[biodiversity]] and the politics of [[minority group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manalili MA, Pearson A, Sulik J, Creechan L, Elsherif M, Murkumbi I, Azevedo F, Bonnen KL, Kim JS, Kording K, Lee JJ, Obscura M, Kapp SK, Röer JP, Morstead T | display-authors = 6 | title = From Puzzle to Progress: How Engaging With Neurodiversity Can Improve Cognitive Science | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = e13255 | date = February 2023 | pmid = 36807910 | doi = 10.1111/cogs.13255 | s2cid = 257068968 | url = http://sure.sunderland.ac.uk/id/eprint/15757/1/Cognitive%20Science%20-%202023%20-%20Manalili%20-%20From%20Puzzle%20to%20Progress%20%20How%20Engaging%20With%20Neurodiversity%20Can%20Improve%20Cognitive.pdf | access-date = April 6, 2023 | archive-date = April 7, 2023 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20230407220825/https://sure.sunderland.ac.uk/id/eprint/15757/1/Cognitive%20Science%20-%202023%20-%20Manalili%20-%20From%20Puzzle%20to%20Progress%20%20How%20Engaging%20With%20Neurodiversity%20Can%20Improve%20Cognitive.pdf | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reflections on the Neurodiversity Paradigm: What is Neurodiversity? |url=https://neurodiversity2.blogspot.com/p/what.html |access-date=April 12, 2022 |website=Reflections on the Neurodiversity Paradigm |archive-date=April 1, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230401064658/https://neurodiversity2.blogspot.com/p/what.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Singer J |asin=B01HY0QTEE |title=NeuroDiversity: The Birth of an Idea |date=July 3, 2016 |publisher=Judy Singer |edition=2nd |language=English}}{{sps|date=April 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some neurodiversity advocates and researchers argue that the neurodiversity paradigm is the middle ground between strong [[Medical model of disability|medical model]] and strong social model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dwyer P | title = The Neurodiversity Approach(es): What Are They and What Do They Mean for Researchers? | journal = Human Development | volume = 66 | issue = 2 | pages = 73–92 | date = May 2022 | pmid = 36158596 | pmc = 9261839 | doi = 10.1159/000523723 | s2cid = 247062174 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social work with disabled people| vauthors = Oliver M, Sapey B |date=2006 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=1403918384|edition= 3rd|location=Basingstoke, Hampshire|oclc=62326930}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomsbury"&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PV95DwAAQBAJ |title=The Bloomsbury Companion to Philosophy of Psychiatry | vauthors = Chapman R |date=January 10, 2019 |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=978-1350024069 | veditors = Tekin S, Bluhm R |pages=371–387 |chapter=Neurodiversity Theory and Its Discontents: Autism, Schizophrenia, and the Social Model of Disability  |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PV95DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Damian Milton]] notes that, in 2014, Nick Walker attempted to define neurodiversity, the neurodiversity movement, and the neurodiversity paradigm. Walker tied neurodiversity to the idea that "all brains are to a degree unique". He also defined the movement as a rights movement, and the paradigm as a broader discussion of diversity, cultural constructions and social dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Reception ===
"Critiques of the Neurodiversity Movement", a 2020 review, raised two concerns regarding the term:
* Many people who do not have an autism diagnosis have autistic traits (known by researchers as the "broad autism phenotype"), so there is no clear bimodal distribution separating people with and without autism. In reality there are not two distinct populations, one "neurotypical" and one "neurodivergent".&lt;ref name=Russell20&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Russell G |title=Autistic Community and the Neurodiversity Movement |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2020 |isbn=978-981-13-8437-0 |veditors=Kapp S |location=Singapore |pages=287–303 |chapter=Critiques of the Neurodiversity Movement |doi=10.1007/978-981-13-8437-0_21 |oclc=1127055276 |chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-981-13-8437-0_21.pdf |s2cid=210483688 |access-date=May 13, 2022 |archive-date=October 28, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211028053840/https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-981-13-8437-0_21.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|288}}

{{Main|Double empathy problem}}
[[File:Double empathy problem image.jpg|thumb|Both autistic and non-autistic people can find it difficult to empathize with each other. The fact that both people in the interaction have trouble with understanding and empathy is why the theory is called the "double empathy problem".&lt;ref name="double-empathy-why"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Crompton |first1=Catherine J. |last2=DeBrabander |first2=Kilee |last3=Heasman |first3=Brett |last4=Milton |first4=Damian |last5=Sasson |first5=Noah J. |date=2021-05-11 |title=Double Empathy: Why Autistic People Are Often Misunderstood |journal=[[Frontiers for Young Minds]] |volume=9 |pages=554875 |doi=10.3389/frym.2021.554875 |issn=2296-6846 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The theory of the double empathy problem argues that autistic people do not lack empathy, but rather that the experiences of autistic and non-autistic people are so different that it is hard for one to understand how the other thinks; for example, non-autistic people may not understand when an autistic person is overwhelmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = DeThorne L |date=April 1, 2020 |title=Revealing the Double Empathy Problem: It's not that autistic* people lack empathy.

The problem with the double empathy problem theory is that there is no simple fix for it. Attempting to "treat" the person with autism could generate other mental health issues and feelings of inferiority and self-blame. However, neurotypical individuals can adapt this theory to better understand how neurodivergent people think and empathize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The double empathy problem |url=https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/professional-practice/double-empathy |access-date=June 3, 2023 |website=www.autism.org.uk |language=en |archive-date=March 30, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230330104453/https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/professional-practice/double-empathy |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of neurodiversity strive to reconceptualize autism and related conditions in society by acknowledging that neurodiversity does not require a cure, changing the language from the current "condition, disease, disorder, or illness"-based nomenclature, "broadening the understanding of healthy or independent living", acknowledging new types of autonomy, and giving neurodivergent individuals more control over their treatment, including the type, timing, and whether there should be treatment at all.&lt;ref name="article"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fenton A, Krahn T | title = Autism, neurodiversity and equality beyond the'normal. | journal = Journal of Ethics in Mental Health | date = November 2007 | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 1–6 | url = http://www.jemh.ca/issues/v2n2/documents/JEMH_V2N2_Theme_Article2_Neurodiversity_Autism.pdf | access-date = August 9, 2013 | archive-date = April 28, 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190428185724/https://jemh.ca/issues/v2n2/documents/JEMH_V2N2_Theme_Article2_Neurodiversity_Autism.pdf | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomsbury" /&gt;

Activists such as [[Jennifer White-Johnson]] have helped bring attention to the neurodiversity movement, by creating symbols of protest and recognition, including a combination of the [[black power fist]] and [[infinity symbol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors =  Lupton E, Kafei F, Tobias J, Halstead JA, Sales K, Xia L, Vergara V |title=Extra bold : a feminist inclusive anti-racist nonbinary field guide for graphic designers |date=2021 |location=Hudson, NY| publisher = Princeton Architectural Press |isbn=978-1-61689-918-9 |edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 study&lt;ref name="Griffin"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Griffin E, Pollak D | title = Student experiences of neurodiversity in higher education: insights from the BRAINHE project | journal = Dyslexia | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–41 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19140120 | doi = 10.1002/dys.383 }}&lt;/ref&gt; separated 27 students with conditions including autism, dyslexia, developmental coordination disorder, ADHD, and having suffered a stroke into two categories of self-view: "A 'difference' view—where neurodiversity was seen as a difference incorporating a set of strengths and weaknesses, or a 'medical/deficit' view—where neurodiversity was seen as a disadvantageous medical condition." They found that, although all of the students reported uniformly difficult schooling careers involving exclusion, abuse, and bullying, those who viewed themselves from the "difference" view (41% of the study cohort) "indicated higher academic self-esteem and confidence in their abilities and many (73%) expressed considerable career ambitions with positive and clear goals."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Many of these students reported gaining this view of themselves through contact with neurodiversity advocates in online support groups.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

A 2013 online survey which aimed to assess conceptions of autism and neurodiversity suggested that conception of autism as a difference, and not a deficit, is developmentally beneficial and "transcend[s] a [[false dichotomy]] between celebrating differences and ameliorating deficit."&lt;ref name="Kapp"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kapp SK, Gillespie-Lynch K, Sherman LE, Hutman T | title = Deficit, difference, or both?

Neurodiversity advocate [[John Elder Robison]] argues that the disabilities and strengths conferred by neurological differences may be mutually inseparable. "When 99 neurologically identical people fail to solve a problem, it's often the 1% fellow who's different who holds the key. Yet that person may be disabled or disadvantaged most or all of the time. To neurodiversity proponents, people are disabled because they are at the edges of the bell curve, not because they are sick or broken."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What Is Neurodiversity?|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/my-life-aspergers/201310/what-is-neurodiversity|access-date=September 17, 2020|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neurodiversity and education ===
Diversity in the education system is not always observed from a neurodiverse perspective. There are several models that are used to understand disability. One is the medical model of disability that views people with disabilities as needing to be treated or cured.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Kwon, Chang-kyu, et al. "Understanding Career Development Pathways of College Students with Disabilities using Crip Theory and the Theory of Whole Self." ''Journal of Diversity in Higher Education'' 16.4 (2023): 520–525. ''ProQuest.'' Web. 27 July 2023.&lt;/ref&gt; Another is the social model of disability putting emphasis on the way that society treats people with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The social model argues that people with disabilities experience more difficulties from society than the disability alone.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Nachman and colleagues reviewed several articles published by 2-year community colleges and found some discrepancies in the way that they perceived and categorized "disabled" students and "non-disabled" students.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Nachman, Brett Ranon, and Kirsten R. Brown. "Crip Places: Dismantling Disability Discourse in the 2-Year College Literature." ''Journal of Diversity in Higher Education'' (2022)''ProQuest.'' Web. 27 July 2023.&lt;/ref&gt; They found that all of the articles were attempting to normalize disability.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Many of them put distinct separation between typical and atypical learners as well as their potential academic achievement.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Nachman also found that many of the articles showed a lack of autonomy for neurodivergent students.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; They had little power in regard to academic choices and classroom management.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Another study explored minority stress through the lens of transgender and gender diverse students who were neurodivergent.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Farquhar-Leicester, Alexander, Elliot Tebbe, and Michael Scheel. "The Intersection of Transgender and Gender-Diverse Identity and Neurodiversity among College Students: An Exploration of Minority Stress." ''Psychology of Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity'' (2022)''ProQuest.'' Web. 27 July 2023.&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers found that these students were likely to experience multiple forms of oppression rather than just one.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Some of those types include gender related oppression and oppression related to their neurodivergence.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The students who had a higher level of minority stress due to stigma awareness were expected to have lower academic performance and higher risk of psychological distress.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Career preparation that is specifically targeted for neurodivergent students is lacking.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There are several programs that exist to help assist neurodivergent individuals in finding and obtaining a job but not many of those programs exist within schools.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This can make it difficult for neurodivergent students to find a career path that they feel is attainable for them.

=== Neurodiversity and the workplace ===
Neurodivergent individuals are subjected to bias when applying and interviewing for job positions.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whelpley CE, May CP | title = Seeing is Disliking: Evidence of Bias Against Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Traditional Job Interviews | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 53 | issue = 4 | pages = 1363–1374 | date = April 2023 | pmid = 35294714 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-022-05432-2 | s2cid = 247498491 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, neurodivergent individuals can have their social engagement style compared to neurotypical individuals, which can affect their ability to obtain a job position.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Stigmas against neurodivergence (especially against autistic individuals) and cognition challenges in social situations can hinder an individual's ability to perform well in a traditional job interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Willis C, Powell-Rudy T, Colley K, Prasad J | title = Examining the Use of Game-Based Assessments for Hiring Autistic Job Seekers | journal = Journal of Intelligence | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 53 | date = November 2021 | pmid = 34842751 | pmc = 8628896 | doi = 10.3390/jintelligence9040053 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[systematic review]] that considered developmental dyslexia (DD) as "an expression of neurodiversity," it was suggested that neurodiversity is not yet an established concept in the workplace, and therefore, support from social relationships and work accommodations is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Beer J, Heerkens Y, Engels J, van der Klink J | title = Factors relevant to work participation from the perspective of adults with developmental dyslexia: a systematic review of qualitative studies | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 1083 | date = May 2022 | pmid = 35642026 | pmc = 9158268 | doi = 10.1186/s12889-022-13436-x | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, another systematic review that focused on [[pharmacological]] and combined pharmacological/[[psychosocial]] interventions for adults with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] found that there were few workplace-based intervention studies, and suggested that additional research needs to be conducted to figure out how to best support neurodivergent employees in the workplace.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lauder K, McDowall A, Tenenbaum HR |date=2022 |title=A systematic review of interventions to support adults with ADHD at work – Implications from the paucity of context-specific research for theory and practice |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=13 |pages=893469 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2022.893469 |pmc=9443814 |pmid=36072032 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] suggested that neurodivergent individuals would benefit from [[remote work]] as it allowed them to engage in their interests, but that social engagement is still necessary for productivity and performance.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goldfarb Y, Gal E, Golan O |date=January 2022 |title=Implications of Employment Changes Caused by COVID-19 on Mental Health and Work-Related Psychological Need Satisfaction of Autistic Employees: A Mixed-Methods Longitudinal Study |journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=89–102 |doi=10.1007/s10803-021-04902-3 |pmc=7908957 |pmid=33635422}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study supported these findings and stressed the need for redesigned work and social conditions to be more inclusive for individuals with autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomczak MT, Mpofu E, Hutson N | title = Remote Work Support Needs of Employees with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Poland: Perspectives of Individuals with Autism and Their Coworkers | journal = International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health | volume = 19 | issue = 17 | pages = 10982 | date = September 2022 | pmid = 36078696 | pmc = 9518488 | doi = 10.3390/ijerph191710982 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
{{Further|Controversies in autism#Advocacy initiatives}}
The neurodiversity paradigm is controversial in autism advocacy.&lt;ref name="Jaarsma" /&gt; The dominant [[paradigm]], the [[medical model of disability]] holds that neurodivergent individuals have medical conditions which should be treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/exploringdiagnosis/files/2017/03/Adam-Feinstein-notes-for-neurodiversity-talk-for-Exeter-December-11-2017.pdf|title=Neurodiversity: The cases for and against|vauthors=Feinstein A|date=December 11, 2017|access-date=May 15, 2019|archive-date=May 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190515031444/http://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/exploringdiagnosis/files/2017/03/Adam-Feinstein-notes-for-neurodiversity-talk-for-Exeter-December-11-2017.pdf|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common criticism is that the neurodiversity paradigm is too widely encompassing and that its conception should exclude those whose functioning is more severely impaired.&lt;ref name="Jaarsma" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qEBLQ3hTJw4C|title=Autism: A Very Short Introduction| vauthors = Frith U |year= 2008|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0191578656|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, autistic advocate Nick Walker suggested that neurodiversity refers specifically to "pervasive neurocognitive differences [...] intimately related to the formation and constitution of the self," in contrast to medical conditions such as [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref name="Bloomsbury" /&gt; {{Undue weight inline|date=May 2023}}

== In social media ==
The increase of representation of the neurodiversity movement in the media came about with changes in the technology of the media platforms themselves.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; The recent addition of text-based options on various social media sites allow disabled users to communicate, enjoy, and share at a more accessible rate.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Social media]] has a two-fold benefit to the neurodivergent community: it can help spread awareness and pioneer the neurodiversity movement, and it can also allow members of the communities themselves to connect.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite conference | vauthors = Wang T, Garfield M, Wisniewski P, Page X |chapter=Benefits and Challenges for Social Media Users on the Autism Spectrum |date=October 17, 2020 |book-title=Conference Companion Publication of the 2020 on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing |pages=419–424 |location=New York |publisher=Association for Computing Machinery |doi=10.1145/3406865.3418322 |isbn=978-1-4503-8059-1 |title=Conference Companion Publication of the 2020 on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gabarron E, Dechsling A, Skafle I, Nordahl-Hansen A | title = Discussions of Asperger Syndrome on Social Media: Content and Sentiment Analysis on Twitter | journal = JMIR Formative Research | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = e32752 | date = March 2022 | pmid = 35254265 | pmc = 8938830 | doi = 10.2196/32752 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social media as a platform ===
Media platforms allow the connection of individuals of similar backgrounds to find a community of support with one another.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; Online networking and connections allows for the user to decide their level of comfort with interactions, and allow them to retain control of a relationship with another user.

Social media also allows users to spread awareness about the [[Autism rights movement|neurodiversity movement]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Calhoun AJ, Gold JA | title = 'I Feel Like I Know Them': the Positive Effect of Celebrity Self-disclosure of Mental Illness | journal = Academic Psychiatry | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 237–241 | date = April 2020 | pmid = 32100256 | doi = 10.1007/s40596-020-01200-5 | s2cid = 211479198 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing awareness about disorders has been shown to increase the amount of factual information spread.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The spread of information through social media exposure can assist the neurodiversity movement in educating the public about understanding disabilities such as [[autism]] and sifting out misinformation.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; By sharing neurodivergent experiences from a first hand perspective, social media can educate the public and destigmatize certain disorders, but negative portrayals of neurodivergence can have an obstructive impact on members of the community.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stuart H | title = Media portrayal of mental illness and its treatments: what effect does it have on people with mental illness? | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 99–106 | date = February 1, 2006 | pmid = 16478286 | doi = 10.2165/00023210-200620020-00002 | s2cid = 21633246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Challenges within media ===
Although representation of the neurodivergent community has grown with the help of social media platforms, those users are often criticized and misunderstood.&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Bitman N |date=February 11, 2022 |title="Authentic" digital inclusion? Dis/ability performances on social media by users with concealable communicative disabilities |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14614448211063183 |journal=New Media and Society |language=en |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=401–419 |doi=10.1177/14614448211063183 |s2cid=246777065 |issn=1461-4448 |via=Sage Journals |access-date=April 11, 2022 |archive-date=April 15, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220415022906/https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14614448211063183 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media has not entirely removed the social barriers that restrict inclusion of neurodivergent peoples. Some have reported needing to conform to the mainstream view of their disability to be seen as "authentic" users.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; Doing so has indirectly made it more difficult for neurodivergent users to grow platforms.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Salisbury M, Pooley J |date=January 20, 2017 |title=The #nofilter Self: The Contest for Authenticity among Social Networking Sites, 2002–2016 |journal=Social Sciences |language=en |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=10 |doi=10.3390/socsci6010010 |issn=2076-0760 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-disabled users evaluating the authenticity of neurodivergent users based on stereotypes shows that the neurodiversity movement has not reached its goal of inclusion.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

== Clinical setting ==

=== Medicine and Healthcare ===
Medical and healthcare professionals have begun to acknowledge neurodivergence among its employees.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Duong |first1=Diana |last2=Vogel |first2=Lauren |date=2022 |title=Untapped potential: embracing neurodiversity in medicine |journal=CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=194 |issue=27 |pages=E951–E952 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.1096006 |issn=0820-3946 |pmc=9299741 |pmid=35851534}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Im |first1=David S |last2=Tamarelli |first2=Carrie M |date=2023 |title=Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Medical Learners and Physicians and a Potentially Helpful Educational Tool |journal=Advances in Medical Education and Practice |volume=14 |pages=435–442 |doi=10.2147/AMEP.S398196 |issn=1179-7258 |pmid=37131931 |pmc=10149068 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, more groups are being created that are centered around advocacy and peer support among medical and healthcare professionals who associate themselves with neurodiversity, such as the Autistic Doctors International created by Dr. Mary Doherty.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another approach is the implementation of a 5-minute video summary (5MVS) for medical learners and physicians who have [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; It consists of a 5-minute recorded video summary in which an engaging speaker presents the relevant information from a scientific article about ADHD using a brief PowerPoint presentation shared using videoconferencing technology. The researchers state that providing this educational tool for helping medical learners and physicians with ADHD acquire relevant information from scientific articles could help in addressing their inattention, impulsivity and/or hyperactivity, and improve their development of critical appraisal skills when working in healthcare.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Similarly, healthcare systems may benefit from hiring neurodiverse individuals to gain a unique perspective when caring for patients.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Embracing Neurodiversity in Our Health Systems |url=https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/aap-voices/embracing-neurodiversity-in-our-health-systems/ |access-date=2023-10-26 |website=www.aap.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some healthcare staff agree that inviting neurodiverse individuals to join patient advisory groups and/or hire them as staff are essential steps to acceptance and integration in the workforce. Neurodiverse people’s unique strengths can be vital to health system innovation and improvement efforts.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; One example of the push toward this is the Stanford Neurodiversity Project, in which one of their goals is to discover the strengths of neurodiverse individuals and make use of their talents to increase innovation and productivity of their society, such as working in the field of healthcare and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Stanford Neurodiversity Project |url=https://med.stanford.edu/neurodiversity.html |access-date=2023-10-26 |website=Stanford Neurodiversity Project |language=sm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurodiversity has also recently been investigated as a new way of working within neurodevelopmental clinics in the UK.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Dunn |first1=Zach D. |last2=Gowda |first2=Asha |last3=Horsfall Turner |first3=Isobel C. |date=2023 |title=The viability of a proposed psychoeducational neurodiversity approach in children services: The PANDA (the Portsmouth alliance's neuro-diversity approach) |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13591045231184121 |journal=Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry |language=en |doi=10.1177/13591045231184121 |pmid=37311174 |s2cid=259153165 |issn=1359-1045}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team of researchers in Portsmouth, England have created an approach in aiding neurodiverse individuals known as PANDA, or the Portsmouth Alliance Neurodiversity Approach. This approach may help medical and healthcare professionals facilitate understanding, communication and early support for children who may identify as being neurodiverse.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Therapy ===
Neurodiversity and the role it plays in therapeutic settings has been a central focal point in recent years. Many therapists and mental health professionals have pushed for more inclusive psychotherapeutic frameworks appropriate for neurodivergent individuals.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Chapman |first1=Robert |last2=Botha |first2=Monique |date=2023 |title=Neurodivergence-informed therapy |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36082483/ |journal=Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=310–317 |doi=10.1111/dmcn.15384 |issn=1469-8749 |pmid=36082483|s2cid=252161995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Healey |first=Gemma |date=2023 |title=What is neurodiversity affirming therapy? |url=https://www.lawsonpsychology.com.au/neurodiversity-affirming-therapy/ |access-date=2023-10-22 |website=Lawson Clinical Psychology |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is neurodivergence-informed therapy, which reframes dysfunction as interconnectedness among society rather than strictly individual, advocating for acceptance and pride in the neurodiversity community, and the push for therapists to pursue [[humility]] regarding the knowledge and education associated with individuals who identify as neurodivergent.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Similarly, neurodiversity affirming therapy supports neurodivergent differences, rather than viewing them as something that should be "cured," and to offer ways to support the individual with difficult areas, while still appreciating their needs and strengths.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Therapeutic programs and interventions are also being investigated for the neurodivergent community.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=McDonald |first1=T. A. Meridian |last2=Lalani |first2=Salima |last3=Chen |first3=Ivy |last4=Cotton |first4=Claire M. |last5=MacDonald |first5=Lydia |last6=Boursoulian |first6=Lana J. |last7=Wang |first7=Jiahao |last8=Malow |first8=Beth A. |date=2023 |title=Appropriateness, Acceptability, and Feasibility of a Neurodiversity-Based Self-determination Program for Autistic Adults |journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders |volume=53 |issue=8 |pages=2933–2953 |doi=10.1007/s10803-022-05598-9 |issn=1573-3432 |pmc=9934918 |pmid=35618972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Manning |first1=Catherine |last2=Scerif |first2=Gaia |date=2023 |title=Understanding perceptual decisions by studying development and neurodiversity |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=300–306 |doi=10.1177/09637214231162369 |issn=0963-7214 |pmc=7614885 |pmid=37547284}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Self-determination]] programs to help neurodivergent individuals achieve goals in their life has been founded to be successful, with neurodivergent participants finding it to be "appropriate, acceptable, and feasible."&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Various approaches (e.g., eye-tracking, longitudinal data, computational modeling) in understanding perceptual decision-making in neurodivergent individuals are also being studied and the implications it may have in the therapeutic environment in working with the neurodivergent population.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

Another form of therapeutic intervention in that has been investigated in neurodivergent individuals is the use of Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBIs).&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Schuck |first1=Rachel K. |last2=Tagavi |first2=Daina M. |last3=Baiden |first3=Kaitlynn M. P. |last4=Dwyer |first4=Patrick |last5=Williams |first5=Zachary J. |last6=Osuna |first6=Anthony |last7=Ferguson |first7=Emily F. |last8=Jimenez Muñoz |first8=Maria |last9=Poyser |first9=Samantha K. |last10=Johnson |first10=Joy F. |last11=Vernon |first11=Ty W. |date=2022 |title=Neurodiversity and Autism Intervention: Reconciling Perspectives Through a Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Intervention Framework |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-021-05316-x |journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders |language=en |volume=52 |issue=10 |pages=4625–4645 |doi=10.1007/s10803-021-05316-x |issn=1573-3432 |pmc=9508016 |pmid=34643863}}&lt;/ref&gt; NDBIs have been shown to have positive effects on language and social-communication while, at the same time, respecting individuals’ needs and autonomy. One of the key goals in this type of intervention is putting the focus of therapy on the neurodivergent individual themselves in the creation of intervention goals, procedures, and outcomes. In doing so, they are likely to be seen as more acceptable, useful, and effective to that individual.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;
