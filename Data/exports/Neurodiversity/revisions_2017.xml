There is a neurodiversity movement, which is an international [[civil rights movements|civil rights movement]] that has the [[autism rights movement]] as its most influential submovement. Sharing the Disability Rights slogan, "[[Nothing About Us Without Us]]", the movement promotes self-advocacy of its members. Neurodiversity advocates promote support systems (such as inclusion-focused services, accommodations, communication and assistive technologies, occupational training, and independent living support)&lt;ref name="ASAN"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://autisticadvocacy.org/policy-advocacy/position-statements/|title=Position Statements|publisher=Autistic Self Advocacy Network|accessdate=April 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that allow those who are "non-neurotypical" to live their lives as they are, rather than being coerced or forced to adopt uncritically accepted ideas of normality, or to conform to a clinical ideal.&lt;ref name="Syracuse"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://neurodiversitysymposium.wordpress.com/what-is-neurodiversity/|title=What is Neurodiversity?|publisher=National Symposium on Neurodiversity at Syracuse University|year=2011|accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Challenging pervasive social norms and [[social stigma|stigmas]], it frames [[autism spectrum|autism]], ADHD/ADD, dyslexia, [[bipolar disorder|bipolarity]] and other neurotypes as a natural human variation rather than a pathology or disorder, and rejects the idea that neurological differences need to be (or can be) [[cure]]d, as they believe them to be authentic forms of human [[diversity (politics)|diversity]], self-expression, and being.

==Terminology==
According to the 2011 National Symposium on Neurodiversity held at [[Syracuse University]], neurodiversity is:

{{quote|... a concept where neurological differences are to be recognized and respected as any other human variation. These differences can include those labeled with Dyspraxia, Dyslexia, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Dyscalculia, Autistic Spectrum, Tourette Syndrome, and others.&lt;ref name="Syracuse"/&gt;}}

According to Pier Jaarsma in 2011, neurodiversity is a "controversial concept" that "regards atypical neurological development as a normal human difference".&lt;ref name=Jaarsma&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jaarsma P, Welin S |title=Autism as a Natural Human Variation: Reflections on the Claims of the Neurodiversity Movement |journal=Health Care Anal |date=February 2011 |pmid=21311979 |doi=10.1007/s10728-011-0169-9 |url=http://www.imh.liu.se/avd_halsa_samhalle/filarkiv1/1.264263/JaarsmaWelin2011Autismasanaturalvariation.pdf |format=PDF |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=20–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nick Walker argued in 2012 that there is no such thing as a "neurodiverse individual", because the concept of neurodiversity encompasses all people of every neurological status, and that all people are neurodiverse. Walker instead proposes the term ''neurominority'' as "a good, non-pathologizing word for referring to all people who aren't neurotypical." He says that people with other neurological styles are "marginalized and poorly accommodated by the dominant culture".&lt;ref name=LoudHands&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Nick|title=Loud Hands: Autistic People, Speaking|year=2012|publisher=The Autistic Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9781938800023|pages=154–162|authorlink=Throw Away the Master's Tools: Liberating Ourselves from the Pathology Paradigm|editor=Julia Bascom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker proposes making a distinction between neurodiversity as an overarching concept, and the neurodiversity paradigm, or "the understanding of neurodiversity as a natural form of human diversity subject to the same societal dynamics as other forms of diversity",&lt;ref name=LoudHands /&gt; which is contrasted to the pathology paradigm of representing neurominorities as problematic and pathological solely due to their deviance from the neurotypical majority.

==Autism rights movement==
{{further|Autism rights movement}}
The [[autism rights movement]] (ARM) is a [[social movement]] within the neurodiversity movement that encourages autistic people, their caregivers and society to adopt a position of neurodiversity, accepting autism as a variation in functioning rather than a [[mental disorder]] to be cured.&lt;ref name="Solomon"&gt;{{cite news |work=New York |title=The autism rights movement |last=Solomon |first=Andrew |date=2008-05-25 |accessdate=2008-05-27 |url=http://nymag.com/news/features/47225/| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080527025140/http://nymag.com/news/features/47225/| archivedate= 27 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ARM advocates a variety of goals including a greater acceptance of autistic behaviors;&lt;ref name=AAP&gt;[http://www.taaproject.com/about-us/mission-statement/ Mission Statement.] Autism Acceptance Project.

Autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the human genome. This perspective is distinct from two other likewise distinct views: the mainstream perspective that autism is caused by a genetic defect and should be addressed by targeting the genes that cause autism; and the perspective that autism is caused by environmental factors like vaccines and pollution and could be cured by addressing environmental causes.&lt;ref name="Solomon"/&gt;

Many autistic supporters of autism rights describe themselves through words that emphasize the condition as an intrinsic part of their identity, such as "autistic", or "aspie" for those with [[Asperger syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Ortega2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ortega|first1=Francisco|title=The Cerebral Subject and the Challenge of Neurodiversity|journal=BioSocieties|date=December 2009|volume=4|issue=4|pages=425–445|doi=10.1017/S1745855209990287|url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/biosoc/journal/v4/n4/full/biosoc200938a.html|language=en|issn=1745-8552}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts to a general recommendation by [[United States|US]] disability advocacy organizations for the use of [[person-first language]] when referring to a person with a medical or mental condition or disability, which emphasizes the ''person'' with the condition, who has, rather than is defined by it.&lt;ref&gt;[[BusinessWeek]] (letter to the editor), Issues 3059–3062, 1988 [https://books.google.com/books?id=tGA1AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22people-first+language%22&amp;dq=%22people-first+language%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SaLOTKWwAYeBOoS1jOcB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA];

===Acceptance perspective===
Members of the various autism rights organizations view autism as a way of life rather than as a disease and thus advocate acceptance over a search for a cure.&lt;ref name=Harmon&gt;Harmon, Amy. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9C07E0D9143CF93AA35756C0A9629C8B63 Neurodiversity Forever; The Disability Movement Turns to Brains.] ''The New York Times'', May 9, 2004.

The ''"acceptance perspective"'' endorsed by the movement is a view that [[autism spectrum|autism]] is not a disorder, but a normal occurrence—an alternate variation in brain wiring or a less common expression of the human genome.&lt;ref name="Harmon"/&gt; Advocates of this perspective believe that autism is a unique way of being that should be validated, supported and appreciated rather than shunned, discriminated against or eliminated.&lt;ref name="Harmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gal&gt;{{cite news |author=Gal L |title=Who says autism's a disease? |work=Haaretz |date=2007-06-28 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/876283.html |accessdate=2007-07-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070701201936/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/876283.html| archivedate= 1 July 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe quirks and uniqueness of autistic individuals should be tolerated as the differences of any minority group should be tolerated and that efforts to eliminate autism should not be compared, for example, to curing cancer but instead to the antiquated notion of curing [[left-handedness]].&lt;ref name="Harmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dawson&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.autistics.org/library/dawson.html|title=In Support of Michelle Dawson and Her Work|publisher=Autistics.org |accessdate=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ARM is a part of the larger disability rights movement, and as such acknowledges the social model of disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Waltz, M |title=Autism: A Social and Medical History |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=London |year=2013 |isbn=0-230-52750-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the model, struggles faced by autistic people are viewed as discrimination rather than deficiencies.

===Advocacy===
According to Andrew Fenton and Tim Krahn, proponents of neurodiversity strive to reconceptualize autism and related conditions in society by the following measures: acknowledging that neurodiversity does not require a cure; changing the language from the current "condition, disease, disorder, or illness"-based nomenclature and "broaden[ing] the understanding of healthy or independent living"; acknowledging new types of autonomy; and giving non-neurotypical individuals more control over their treatment, including the type, timing, and whether there should be treatment at all.&lt;ref name="article"&gt;Fenton, Andrew, and Tim Krahn. [http://www.jemh.ca/issues/v2n2/documents/JEMH_V2N2_Theme_Article2_Neurodiversity_Autism.pdf "Autism, Neurodiversity and Equality Beyond the Normal" (PDF).] Journal of Ethics in Mental Health 2.2 (2007): 1-6. 10  November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 study&lt;ref name=Griffin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griffin|first=Edward|author2=Pollak, David|title=Student experiences of neurodiversity in higher education: Insights from the BRAINHE project.|journal=Dyslexia|date=January 2009|volume=15|issue=1|pages=23–41|pmid=19140120|doi=10.1002/dys.383}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Edward Griffin and David Pollak separated 27 students (with autism, dyslexia, developmental coordination disorder, ADHD, and stroke), into two categories of self-view: "a 'difference' view—where neurodiversity was seen as a difference incorporating a set of strengths and weaknesses, or a 'medical/deficit' view—where neurodiversity was seen as a disadvantageous medical condition". They found that although all of the students reported uniformly difficult schooling careers involving exclusion, abuse, and bullying, those who viewed themselves from a difference view (41% of the study cohort) "indicated higher academic self-esteem and confidence in their abilities and many (73%) expressed considerable career ambitions with positive and clear goals".&lt;ref name=Griffin/&gt; Many of these students reported gaining this view of themselves through contact with neurodiversity advocates in online support groups.&lt;ref name=Griffin/&gt;

A 2013 online survey said this: "Such a deficit-as-difference conception of autism suggests the importance of harnessing autistic traits in developmentally beneficial ways, transcending a false dichotomy between celebrating differences and ameliorating deficit".&lt;ref name="Kapp"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kapp|first=Steven K.|date=January 2013|title=Deficit, difference, or both?

==History==
According to Jaarsma and Welin (2011), the "neurodiversity movement was developed in the 1990s by online groups of autistic persons. It is now associated with the struggle for the civil rights of all those diagnosed with neurological or neurodevelopmental disorders."&lt;ref name=Jaarsma/&gt; The term neurodiversity also represents a move away from the "mother-blaming" or [[refrigerator mother]] theories of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="genetics"&gt;Bumiller, Kristen. "The Geneticization of Autism: From New Reproductive Technologies to the Conception of Genetic Normalcy." Signs 34.4 (2009): 875-99. ''Chicago Journals''. University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The neurodiversity paradigm was initially embraced by individuals on the [[autism spectrum]],&lt;ref name=Jaarsma/&gt; but subsequent groups have applied the concept to conditions that aren't on the autism spectrum such as [[bipolar disorder|bipolarity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bphope.com/blog/on-neurodiversity/|title=On Neurodiversity|access-date=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = An Exploration Of The Neurodiversity Movement|url = http://radicalpsychology.org/vol7-1/boundy.html|website = radicalpsychology.org|accessdate = 2015-08-11|quote = Conducting a poll of what she calls her ‘online tribe’, other bipolar people participating in specialized listservs and chatrooms, Antonetta discovered that, like her, most responders like their minds and the gifts their bipolarity brings them.  One man she quotes says: "I choose not to look at bipolarity as an illness at all.  In fact, I couldn’t imagine myself as not being bipolar, nor would I want to be.  The bipolar is a strong component of who I am, and I do not wish to be anyone else but me" (p. 89).  Another respondent wrote, "I feel, and cause others to feel . . .

The term is attributed to Judy Singer, an Australian social scientist on the autism spectrum,&lt;ref name=Jaarsma/&gt; and it first appeared in print in an article by journalist Harvey Blume (which did not credit Singer)&lt;ref name=Solomon/&gt; in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' on September 30, 1998:&lt;ref name=BlumeAtlantic&gt;{{Cite news|author= Blume, Harvey |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199809u/neurodiversity |title= Neurodiversity |work= The Atlantic |date= September 30, 1998 |accessdate= November 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''[[New York Times]]'' piece on June 30, 1997, Blume did not use the term "neurodiversity", but he did describe the foundation of the idea in the phrase "neurological pluralism":&lt;ref name=BlumeNYT&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E7DC1F31F933A05755C0A961958260|author=Blume, Harvey|title=Autistics, freed from face-to-face encounters, are communicating in cyberspace|work=The New York Times|date=June 30, 1997|accessdate=November 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The consensus emerging from the Internet forums and Web sites where autistics congregate [...] is that NT is only one of many neurological configurations -- the dominant one certainly, but not necessarily the best."&lt;ref name=BlumeNYT/&gt;}}

Blume was an early advocate who predicted the role the Internet would play in fostering the international neurodiversity movement, writing:&lt;ref name=BlumeMIT&gt;{{Cite web|author=Blume, Harvey|url=http://web.mit.edu/m-i-t/articles/index_blume.html|title="Autism &amp; The Internet" or "It's The Wiring, Stupid"|date=July 1, 1997|publisher=Media In Transition, Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=November 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|There is a political dimension to this bond with the Internet.

The challenge we will all be increasingly confronted with, on-line and off, is, to look at ourselves differently than we have before, that is, to accept neurological diversity.&lt;ref name=BlumeMIT/&gt;}}

Some authors&lt;ref name=Solomon/&gt;&lt;ref name="article"/&gt; also credit the earlier work of autistic advocate [[Jim Sinclair (activist)|Jim Sinclair]], who was a principal early organizer of the international online autism community. Sinclair's 1993 speech, "Don't Mourn For Us",&lt;ref name=Sinclair&gt;Sinclair, Jim. [http://www.autreat.com/dont_mourn.html Don't Mourn For Us.] Autism Network International, n.d..  Retrieved on 2013-05-07.&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned that some parents considered their child's autism diagnosis as "the most traumatic thing that ever happened to them". Sinclair (who did not speak until the age of 12) addressed the communal grief parents felt by asking them to try to take the perspectives of autistic people themselves:
{{quote|Non-autistic people see autism as a great tragedy, and parents experience continuing disappointment and grief at all stages of the child's and family's life cycle. But this grief does not stem from the child's autism in itself. It is grief over the loss of the normal child the parents had hoped and expected to have ... There's no normal child hidden behind the autism. Autism is a way of being. It is pervasive; it colors every experience, every sensation, perception, thought, emotion, and encounter, every aspect of existence. It is not possible to separate the autism from the person—and if it were possible, the person you'd have left would not be the same person you started with. This is important, so take a moment to consider it: Autism is a way of being. It is not possible to separate the person from the autism.&lt;ref name=Sinclair/&gt;}}

Sinclair is also credited with coining the word "[[neurotypical]]" in the early 1990s, which was originally used to denote people with non-autistic brains, but has morphed in usage to denote neurologically typically developing people (or the culture that is built around such people). Both Singer and Sinclair created new ways to view and frame people with neurological differences – first in regard to the autism spectrum but eventually in regard to other conditions as well.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}{{Original research inline|date=April 2014}}

The term "neurodiversity" has since been applied to other conditions and has taken on a more general meaning; for example, the [[Developmental Adult Neurodiversity Association]] (DANDA) in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] encompasses [[developmental coordination disorder]], [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], [[Asperger's syndrome]] and related conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danda.org.uk/ danda.org.uk]  DANDA website.

== Criticism ==
The concept of neurodiversity is controversial.&lt;ref name=Jaarsma /&gt; Those supporting the [[medical model of disability]] identify the mental differences associated with these conditions as disorders, deficits, and dysfunctions, intrinsic differences in functioning which cause impairments in many areas of life. From this point of view, the mental states that are encompassed by neurodiversity are medical conditions that can and should be treated.&lt;ref name="Pollak"&gt;Pollak, David. 2009. "Neurodiversity in Higher Education." John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Author David Pollak sees neurodiversity as an inclusive term for the equality of all possible mental states. Still others reject the word because they think it sounds too medical.&lt;ref name="Pollak" /&gt;

The concept of neurodiversity as applied to [[autism]] is criticized for being skewed towards the "high-functioning" individuals of the autistic spectrum or those with milder forms of the condition. Those with "low-functioning" autism are often significantly impaired in their everyday functioning, and may not be able to function effectively with even the extensive use of advanced [[Assistive technology|assistive technologies]]. Because many of these low-functioning individuals are unable to communicate effectively to express their opinions and wishes, controversy surrounds the issue of who represents them and what represents their interests.&lt;ref name="MichaelFitzpatrick"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Michael|title=Why we should be cautious about celebrating autism|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/review_of_books/article/why-we-shouldnt-celebrate-autism/17468#.VxzY_nBWY7k|website=www.spiked-online.com|accessdate=24 April 2016|date=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sue Rubin]], an autistic woman and author who was the subject of the documentary ''[[Autism is a World]]'', favors a cure for the condition and asserts that while those with high-functioning autism tend to support the neurodiversity anti-cure position, those who have low functioning autism generally hold the opposite opinion.&lt;ref name="Ortega2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rubin|first1=Sue|title=Acceptance versus cure|url=http://www-cgi.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/presents/shows/autism.world/notebooks/sue/notebook.html|website=www-cgi.cnn.com|publisher=Cable News Network|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaarsma and Welin wrote in 2011 that the "broad version of the neurodiversity claim, covering low-functioning as well as high-functioning autism, is problematic. Only a narrow conception of neurodiversity, referring exclusively to high-functioning autists, is reasonable."&lt;ref name=Jaarsma /&gt; They say that "higher functioning" individuals with autism may "not [be] benefited with such a psychiatric defect-based diagnosis ... some of them are being harmed by it, because of the disrespect the diagnosis displays for their natural way of being", but "think that it is still reasonable to include other categories of autism in the psychiatric diagnostics. The narrow conception of the neurodiversity claim should be accepted but the broader claim should not."&lt;ref name=Jaarsma /&gt;

Criticism has been levied against the "acceptance" position of neurodiversity advocates, with it being noted that even if the biomedical therapies that target the clinical features of, for example, autism and the conditions that may co-occur with it, do not amount to a complete cure, such treatments can still potentially significantly improve the everyday functioning and quality of life of those with these conditions. While such treatments require substantial investment and development and would not be available for application in the immediate future, they may provide greater benefit in the future and in the long-term.&lt;ref name="MichaelFitzpatrick" /&gt; For many who view autism as a disabling developmental disease, the acceptance perspective of neurodiversity insults the suffering of its patients and their families.&lt;ref name="Ortega2009" /&gt;

[[Jonathan Mitchell (writer)|Jonathan Mitchell]], an [[autistic]] author and blogger who is a vocal opponent of the neurodiversity movement and an advocate for research for a cure for autism, criticizes neurodiversity for providing "simplistic solutions to hard problems" and trivializing the disabling aspects of autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Mark|title=A different way of thinking|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/feature/different-way-thinking|website=News|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considers his condition to have negatively affected his life, describing autism as having "prevented me from making a living or ever having a girlfriend. It's given me bad fine motor coordination problems where I can hardly write. I have an impaired ability to relate to people. I can't concentrate or get things done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hamilton|first1=Jon|title=Shortage of Brain Tissue Hinders Autism Research|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/02/04/170835708/shortage-of-brain-tissue-sets-autism-research-back|website=NPR|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes neurodiversity as a "tempting escape valve" for many of the people who are on the autism spectrum, and commenting on the supposition of a general acceptance of neurodiversity by those on the spectrum, says that "most persons with an autism-spectrum disorder have never expressed their opinions on someone's blog and never will" and states that neurodiversity has no solution for low-functioning autistics.&lt;ref name=Solomon /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mitchell|first1=Jonathan|title=Neurodiversity: Just Say No - An Article by Jonathan Mitchell|url=http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/neurodiv.html|website=www.jonathans-stories.com|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticizes [[Temple Grandin]] for making generalizations about the condition and the experiences of those with it, saying that her generalizations trivialize his suffering.&lt;ref name=Osborne&gt;{{cite book|last1=Osborne|first1=Lawrence|title=American Normal : The Hidden World of Asperger Syndrome|date=2002|publisher=Copernicus|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-95307-6|pages=114–115, 155, 158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mitchell has been insulted online by members of neurodiversity, and Dr. Manuel Casanova has claimed that some members of the Neurodiversity movement compare his research to genocide.  He has received disparaging phone calls and emails, and even death threats.&lt;ref name=Hayasaki2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hayasaki|first1=Erika|title=The Debate Over an Autism Cure Turns Hostile|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2015/02/27/one-activists-search-cure-his-autism-drawing-violent-backlash-306998.html|website=Newsweek|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
