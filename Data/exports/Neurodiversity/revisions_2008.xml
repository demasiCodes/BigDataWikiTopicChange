'''Neurodiversity''' is an idea that asserts that atypical (neurodivergent) [[neurology|neurological]] development is a normal human difference that is to be tolerated and respected as any other human difference.&lt;ref name=Movement/&gt;  The concept of neurodiversity is embraced by some [[autism|autistic]] individuals and people with [[Autism spectrum|related conditions]]. Some groups apply the concept of neurodiversity to [[bipolar disorder]], [[ADHD]],&lt;ref name=Woodford&gt;Woodford, Gillian.

==History of the term==
According to an article in ''[[New York Magazine]]'', the term was put forward by Judy Singer and first published by Harvey Blume.&lt;ref name=Solomon&gt;{{cite news |last=Solomon |first=Andrew |title=The Autism Rights Movement |date=2008-05-25 | work=New York Magazine | url=http://nymag.com/news/features/47225/ |accessdate=2008-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest published use of the term appears in a ''New York Times'' article by Harvey Blume on [[September 30]], [[1998]]:&lt;ref name=BlumeAtlantic&gt;{{cite news |author= Blume, Harvey |url= http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199809u/neurodiversity |title= Neurodiversity |work= The Atlantic |date= [[September 30]], [[1998]] |accessdate= 2007-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote| Neurodiversity may be every bit as crucial for the human race as biodiversity is for life in general. Who can say what form of wiring will prove best at any given moment? Cybernetics and computer culture, for example, may favor a somewhat autistic cast of mind.}}

Previous to this, although Blume did not make explicit use of the term ''Neurodiversity'', he wrote in a ''New York Times'' piece on [[June 30]], [[1997]]:&lt;ref name=BlumeNYT&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E7DC1F31F933A05755C0A961958260|author=Blume, Harvey|title=Autistics, freed from face-to-face encounters, are communicating in cyberspace|work=The New York Times|date=[[June 30]], [[1997]]|accessdate=2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|Yet anyone who explores the subject on the Internet quickly discovers an altogether different side of autism. In cyberspace, many of the nation's autistics are doing the very thing the syndrome supposedly deters them from doing -- communicating.

Yet, in trying to come to terms with an [[neurotypical|NT]]-dominated world, autistics are neither willing nor able to give up their own customs. Instead, they are proposing a new social compact, one emphasizing neurological pluralism.

The consensus emerging from the Internet forums and Web sites where autistics congregate (...) is that NT is only one of many neurological configurations -- the dominant one certainly, but not necessarily the best.}}

Blume is also notable for his early public advocacy and prediction of the role the internet would play in fostering neurodiversity.&lt;ref name=BlumeMIT&gt;{{cite web|author=Blume, Harvey|url=http://web.mit.edu/m-i-t/articles/index_blume.html|title="Autism &amp; The Internet" or "It's The Wiring, Stupid"|date=[[July 1]], [[1997]]|publisher=Media In Transition, Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|There is a political dimension to this bond with the Internet. A project called CyberSpace 2000 is devoted to getting as many people as possible in the autistic spectrum hooked up by the year 2000, reason being that "the Internet is an essential means for autistic people to improve their lives, because it is often the only way they can communicate effectively." 

[ ... ] the community of autistics, which may not have matured and come to self-awareness without the Internet, presents the rest of us with a challenge. 

The challenge we will all be increasingly confronted with, on-line and off, is, to look at ourselves differently than we have before, that is, to accept neurological diversity.

The term mostly appears within the online [[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism|autistic community]], but its usage has spread to a more general meaning; for example, the Developmental Adult Neurodiversity Association (DANDA) in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] encompasses [[developmental dyspraxia]], [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], [[Asperger syndrome]] and related conditions.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.danda.org.uk/ Home page.]  DANDA.  Retrieved on [[2007-11-08]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Usage of the term has seen a boost with a 2004 ''New York Times'' article by Amy Harmon, "The Disability Movement Turns to Brains".&lt;ref name=Movement&gt;Harmon, Amy. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9C07E0D9143CF93AA35756C0A9629C8B63 Neurodiversity Forever; The Disability Movement Turns to Brains.] ''The New York Times'', [[May 9]], [[2004]].  Retrieved on [[2007-11-08]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proponents and opponents==
Neurodiversity was prefigured by the work of French historian and theorist [[Michel Foucault]], whose book ''Folie et déraison'' ("Madness and unreason"; published in an abridged version in English as ''[[Madness and Civilization]]'', and eventually in full as ''The History of Madness'') influenced the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement of the 1960s.

Many supporters of neurodiversity are anti-cure autistics,{{Fact|date=August 2008}} who are engaged in advocacy; some parents of autistic children also support neurodiversity. Such parents say they value their children's individuality and want to allow their children to develop naturally. For example, [[Morton Ann Gernsbacher]] is a parent of an autistic child and a psychology professor, who argues that autistics need acceptance, not a cure, and endorses the theory that autism cannot be separated from the person.&lt;ref&gt;Gernsbacher, Morton Ann. [http://www.autistics.org/library/acceptance.html "Autistics Need Acceptance, Not Cure".] autistics.org, [[April 24]], [[2004]]. Retrieved on [[2 February]] [[2007]].&lt;/ref&gt;
