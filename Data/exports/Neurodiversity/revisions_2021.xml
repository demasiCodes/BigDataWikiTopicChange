== History ==
The word neurodiversity is attributed to Judy Singer, a [[Social science|social scientist]] who has described herself as "likely somewhere on the [[Autism spectrum|autistic spectrum.]]"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Meet Judy Singer Neurodiversity Pioneer|url=http://www.myspectrumsuite.com/meet-judy-singer/|access-date=2019-05-14|website=My Spectrum Suite|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She used the term in her sociology honours thesis published in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Singer|first=Judy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nWTlAAAAQBAJ|title=Disability Discourse|date=1999-02-01|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (UK)|isbn=9780335202225|editor-last=Corker|editor-first=Mairian|pages=59–67|language=en|chapter='Why can't you be normal for once in your life?'

University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Singer had been in correspondence with Blume as a result of their mutual interest in autism, and though he did not credit Singer, the word first appeared in print in an article by Blume in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' on September 30, 1998.&lt;ref name="BlumeAtlantic"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Blume, Harvey|date=September 30, 1998|title=Neurodiversity|work=The Atlantic|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199809u/neurodiversity|url-status=dead|access-date=November 7, 2007|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130105003900/http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199809u/neurodiversity|archive-date=January 5, 2013|quote=Neurodiversity may be every bit as crucial for the human race as biodiversity is for life in general.

Proponents of neurodiversity strive to reconceptualize autism and related conditions in society by the following measures: acknowledging that neurodiversity does not require a cure; changing the language from the current "condition, disease, disorder, or illness"-based nomenclature; "broadening the understanding of healthy or independent living"; acknowledging new types of autonomy; and giving non-neurotypical individuals more control over their treatment, including the type, timing, and whether there should be treatment at all.&lt;ref name="article"&gt;Fenton, Andrew, and Tim Krahn.

They found that, although all of the students reported uniformly difficult schooling careers involving exclusion, abuse, and bullying, those who viewed themselves from a difference view (41% of the study cohort) "Indicated higher academic self-esteem and confidence in their abilities and many (73%) expressed considerable career ambitions with positive and clear goals."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Many of these students reported gaining this view of themselves through contact with neurodiversity advocates in online support groups.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

A 2013 online survey, which aimed to assess conceptions of autism and neurodiversity, found that "A deficit-as-difference conception of autism suggests the importance of harnessing autistic traits in developmentally beneficial ways, transcending a false dichotomy between celebrating differences and ameliorating deficit."&lt;ref name="Kapp"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kapp|first=Steven K.|date=January 2013|title=Deficit, difference, or both?

===Controversy===
{{Further|Controversies in autism#Advocacy initiatives}}
The neurodiversity paradigm is controversial in autism advocacy.&lt;ref name="Jaarsma" /&gt; The dominant [[paradigm]] is one which [[Medical model of disability|pathologizes]] human brains that diverge from those considered typical. From this perspective, these brains have medical conditions which should be treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/exploringdiagnosis/files/2017/03/Adam-Feinstein-notes-for-neurodiversity-talk-for-Exeter-December-11-2017.pdf|title=Neurodiversity: The cases for and against|last=Feinstein|first=Adam|date=Dec 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common criticism is that the neurodiversity paradigm is too widely encompassing and that its conception should exclude those whose functioning is more severely impaired.&lt;ref name="Jaarsma" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qEBLQ3hTJw4C|title=Autism: A Very Short Introduction|last=Frith|first=Uta|date=2008-10-23|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191578656|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autistic advocate and interdisciplinary educator Nick Walker offers the distinction that neurodivergencies refer specifically to "pervasive neurocognitive differences" that are "intimately related to the formation and constitution of the self," in contrast to medical conditions such as [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref name="Bloomsbury" /&gt;

Neurodiversity advocate [[John Elder Robison]] agrees that neurological difference may sometimes produce disability, but at the same time he argues that the disability caused by neurological difference may be inseparable from the strengths it provides. "99 neurologically identical people fail to solve a problem, it's often the 1% fellow who's different who holds the key. Yet that person may be disabled or disadvantaged most or all of the time. To neurodiversity proponents, people are disabled because they are at the edges of the bell curve, not because they are sick or broken." He therefore argues for the accommodation of neurological difference while also recognizing that it can produce disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What Is Neurodiversity?|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/my-life-aspergers/201310/what-is-neurodiversity|access-date=2020-09-17|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Undue weight inline|date=October 2021}}
