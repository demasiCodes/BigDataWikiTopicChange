The '''neurodiversity''' {{audio|LL-Q1860 (eng)-Flame, not lame-neurodiversity.wav|}} paradigm is a framework for understanding [[human brain]] function that recognizes the diversity within [[sensory processing]], [[Motor skill|motor abilities]], [[Social anxiety|social comfort]], [[cognition]], and [[Attention|focus]] as neurobiological differences. This diversity falls on a spectrum of neurocognitive differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-13-8437-0 |title=Autistic Community and the Neurodiversity Movement |date=2020 |language=en |doi=10.1007/978-981-13-8437-0 |isbn=978-981-13-8436-3 | veditors = Kapp SK }}&lt;/ref&gt; The neurodiversity paradigm argues that diversity in human cognition is normal and that some conditions generally classified as disorders, such as [[autism]], are differences and disabilities that are not necessarily [[Medical model of disability|pathological]]. Neurotypical individuals are those who fall within the average range of functioning and thinking.

The neurodiversity movement started in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the start of [[Autism Network International]]. Much of the correspondence that led to the formation of the movement happened over autism conferences, namely the autistic-led [[autreat]], penpal lists, and [[Usenet]]. The framework grew out of the [[disability rights movement]] and builds on the [[social model of disability]], arguing that disability partly arises from [[Disability rights movement#Disability barriers|societal barriers]], rather than attributing disability purely to inherent deficits.&lt;ref name="Botha et al., 2024"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Botha |first1=Monique |last2=Chapman |first2=Robert |last3=Giwa Onaiwu |first3=Morénike |last4=Kapp |first4=Steven K |last5=Stannard Ashley |first5=Abs |last6=Walker |first6=Nick |title=The neurodiversity concept was developed collectively: An overdue correction on the origins of neurodiversity theory |journal=Autism |date=12 March 2024 |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=1591–1594 |doi=10.1177/13623613241237871 |pmid=38470140 |language=en |issn=1362-3613 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; It instead situates human cognitive variation in the context of [[biodiversity]] and the politics of [[minority group]]s.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manalili MA, Pearson A, Sulik J, Creechan L, Elsherif M, Murkumbi I, Azevedo F, Bonnen KL, Kim JS, Kording K, Lee JJ, Obscura M, Kapp SK, Röer JP, Morstead T | title = From Puzzle to Progress: How Engaging With Neurodiversity Can Improve Cognitive Science | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = e13255 | date = February 2023 | pmid = 36807910 | doi = 10.1111/cogs.13255 | pmc = 7616419 | s2cid = 257068968 | url = http://sure.sunderland.ac.uk/id/eprint/15757/1/Cognitive%20Science%20-%202023%20-%20Manalili%20-%20From%20Puzzle%20to%20Progress%20%20How%20Engaging%20With%20Neurodiversity%20Can%20Improve%20Cognitive.pdf | access-date = April 6, 2023 | archive-date = April 7, 2023 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20230407220825/https://sure.sunderland.ac.uk/id/eprint/15757/1/Cognitive%20Science%20-%202023%20-%20Manalili%20-%20From%20Puzzle%20to%20Progress%20%20How%20Engaging%20With%20Neurodiversity%20Can%20Improve%20Cognitive.pdf | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reflections on the Neurodiversity Paradigm: What is Neurodiversity? |url=https://neurodiversity2.blogspot.com/p/what.html |access-date=April 12, 2022 |website=Reflections on the Neurodiversity Paradigm |archive-date=April 1, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230401064658/https://neurodiversity2.blogspot.com/p/what.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Singer J | isbn = 978-0-6481547-0-9 |title=NeuroDiversity: The Birth of an Idea |date=July 3, 2016 |publisher=Kindle Ebook |edition=2nd |language=English}}{{self-published inline|date=April 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some neurodiversity advocates and researchers argue that the neurodiversity paradigm is the middle ground between a strong [[Medical model of disability|medical model]] and a strong social model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dwyer P | title = The Neurodiversity Approach(es): What Are They and What Do They Mean for Researchers? | journal = Human Development | volume = 66 | issue = 2 | pages = 73–92 | date = May 2022 | pmid = 36158596 | pmc = 9261839 | doi = 10.1159/000523723 | s2cid = 247062174 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social work with disabled people| vauthors = Oliver M, Sapey B |date=2006 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=1-4039-1838-4|edition= 3rd|location=Basingstoke, Hampshire|oclc=62326930}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomsbury"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PV95DwAAQBAJ |title=The Bloomsbury Companion to Philosophy of Psychiatry |vauthors=Chapman R |date=January 10, 2019 |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=978-1-350-02406-9 |veditors=Tekin S, Bluhm R |pages=371–387 |chapter=Neurodiversity Theory and Its Discontents: Autism, Schizophrenia, and the Social Model of Disability |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PV95DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA371 |access-date=May 12, 2020 |archive-date=July 19, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230719160012/https://books.google.com/books?id=PV95DwAAQBAJ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurodivergent individuals face unique challenges in education and the workplace. The efficacy of accessibility and support programs in career development and higher education depends on the individual.&lt;ref name=":110" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Social media has introduced a platform where neurodiversity awareness and support has emerged, further promoting the neurodiversity movement.

[[Damian Milton]] notes that, in 2014, [[Nick Walker (scholar)|Nick Walker]] attempted to define neurodiversity, the neurodiversity movement, and the neurodiversity paradigm. Walker tied neurodiversity to the idea that "all brains are to a degree unique". She also defined the movement as a rights movement, and the paradigm as a broader discussion of diversity, cultural constructions and social dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Autistic self-advocate and researcher [[Ari Ne'eman]] has suggested a trait-based approach, where elements of the medical (or pathology) model can be applied in treating certain traits, behaviors, or conditions that are intrinsically harmful (e.g. self-injury behaviors, epilepsy, or other co-occurring health conditions), while neurodiversity approaches can be applied to non-harmful or adaptive autistic traits (e.g. [[stimming]], [[Special interest (autism)|intense interests]]) of the same individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ne'eman A, Pellicano E | title = Neurodiversity as Politics | journal = Human Development | volume = 66 | issue = 2 | pages = 149–157 | date = May 2022 | pmid = 36714278 | pmc = 9881465 | doi = 10.1159/000524277 | s2cid = 247829768 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.rasd.2021.101864 | title="It feels like holding back something you need to say": Autistic and Non-Autistic Adults accounts of sensory experiences and stimming | year=2021 | vauthors=Charlton RA, Entecott T, Belova E, Nwaordu G | journal=Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders | volume=89 | page=101864 | s2cid=240532683 | url=https://research.gold.ac.uk/id/eprint/30505/8/Charlton_RASD_Stimming_Author_Copy_corrections.pdf | access-date=April 6, 2023 | archive-date=March 23, 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230323220017/https://research.gold.ac.uk/id/eprint/30505/8/Charlton_RASD_Stimming_Author_Copy_corrections.pdf | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, both new intervention strategies and neurodiversity-based reforms of existing intervention strategies have been developed.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leadbitter K, Buckle KL, Ellis C, Dekker M | title = Autistic Self-Advocacy and the Neurodiversity Movement: Implications for Autism Early Intervention Research and Practice | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 12 | pages = 635690 | date = 2021 | pmid = 33912110 | pmc = 8075160 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2021.635690 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schuck RK, Tagavi DM, Baiden KM, Dwyer P, Williams ZJ, Osuna A, Ferguson EF, Jimenez Muñoz M, Poyser SK, Johnson JF, Vernon TW | title = Neurodiversity and Autism Intervention: Reconciling Perspectives Through a Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Intervention Framework | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 52 | issue = 10 | pages = 4625–4645 | date = October 2022 | pmid = 34643863 | pmc = 9508016 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-021-05316-x | s2cid = 238744698 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurodivergent==
Following the rise of the [[autism rights movement]] in the 1990s, many autistic advocates, including [[Kassiane Asasumasu]], recognized that a wide variety of people experienced the world in ways similar to autistic people, despite not being autistic. As a result, Asasumasu coined the related terms neurodivergent and neurodivergence circa 2000.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Thompson |first=Rachel |date=September 3, 2020 |title=Disability Justice Advocate and Writer Lydia X.

According to Asasumasu, neurodivergent/neurodivergence refers to those "whose neurocognitive functioning diverges from dominant societal norms in multiple ways".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; She intended for these terms to apply to a broad variety of people,&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Neurodivergence |url=https://www.umassp.edu/inclusive-by-design/who-before-how/understanding-disabilities/neurodivergence |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240304010926/https://www.umassp.edu/inclusive-by-design/who-before-how/understanding-disabilities/neurodivergence |archive-date=March 4, 2024 |access-date=March 4, 2024 |website=[[University of Massachusetts]] Office of the President}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Coates |first=Shannon |date=October 25, 2022 |title=Neurodiversity in the Voice Studio, Clinic, and Performance Space: Using a Neurodiversity Affirming Lens to Build More Inclusive Spaces for Singers.

Neurodivergent has been used in multiple ways since Asasumasu's conception, especially to refer specifically to individuals diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; It is also used as an umbrella term used to describe people with atypical [[mental disorder|mental]] and [[emotional and behavioral disorders|behavioral]] traits, such as [[mood disorder|mood]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Adams D, Kaliss N, Missner A, Valentine MM |date=2021 |title=The Interplay of Nicotine and Social Stress Mediate Dopaminergic Neuron Firing in the Ventral Tegmental Area – Nucleus Accumbens Pathway, Contributing to Stress and Depressive Mood Disorder |url=https://gsrjournal.org/index.php/home/article/view/10 |url-status=live |journal=Georgetown Scientific Research Journal |pages=70–83 |doi=10.48091/SUVN5250 |s2cid=234261007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230330114506/https://gsrjournal.org/index.php/home/article/view/10 |archive-date=March 30, 2023 |access-date=September 19, 2022 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[anxiety disorder|anxiety]], [[dissociative disorder|dissociative]], [[spectrum disorder#Psychosis|psychotic]], [[personality disorder|personality]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Homan P, Reddan MC, Brosch T, Koenigsberg HW, Schiller D |date=November 2017 |title=Aberrant link between empathy and social attribution style in borderline personality disorder |url=https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:97897 |url-status=live |journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research |volume=94 |pages=163–171 |doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2017.07.012 |pmid=28735169 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211206172205/https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:97897 |archive-date=December 6, 2021 |access-date=April 6, 2023 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[eating disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Corsi E, Cardi V, Sowden S, Coll MP, Cascino G, Ricca V, Treasure J, Bird G, Monteleone AM |date=August 2021 |title=Socio-cognitive processing in people with eating disorders: Computerized tests of mentalizing, empathy and imitation skills |journal=The International Journal of Eating Disorders |volume=54 |issue=8 |pages=1509–1518 |doi=10.1002/eat.23556 |pmc=8453969 |pmid=34056730}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the neurodiversity framework, these conditions are often referred to as "neurodivergencies", in an effort to move away from the [[medical model of disability]] (sometimes referred to in the neurodiversity community as the "pathology paradigm"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Simpson E, Dalal S, Semaan B |date=2023-04-14 |title="Hey, Can You Add Captions?": The Critical Infrastructuring Practices of Neurodiverse People on TikTok |journal=Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction |language=en |volume=7 |issue=CSCW1 |pages=1–27 |arxiv=2212.06204 |doi=10.1145/3579490 |issn=2573-0142 |s2cid=254591329 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Alternative terms used for neurodiversity===
Advocates within the neurodiversity movements have also coined other alternative [[neologism]]s that people use to refer to themselves with the goal to remove the stigma of the medicalized view of neurodiversity. These terms, such as ''{{vanchor|neurospicy}}'' are often used instead of neurodivergent by people when referring to themself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-11-term-neurospicy-autism-neurodivergences.html|title=Is it OK to use the term 'neurospicy' when talking about autism and other neurodivergences?|date=15 November 2024|access-date=20 November 2024|website=medicalxpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.womensmentalhealthpodcast.com/blog/neurospicy-meaning-origin/|title=Neurospicy Meaning &amp; Origin|date=11 April 2024|access-date=20 November 2024|website=womenshealthpodcast.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurotypical or neuroconforming&lt;span class="anchor" id="Neurotypical"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;==
'''Neurotypical''' (an abbreviation of '''neurologically typical''', sometimes '''NT''') is a [[neologism]] widely used in the neurodiversity movement as a label for anyone who has a neurotype that fits into the norm of thinking patterns. Thus, the term "neurotypical" includes anyone who is not [[autism|autistic]], and does not have [[ADHD]], [[dyslexia]], anxiety, or any other condition that would be considered neurodivergent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Advice {{!}} He's been diagnosed with autism.

In contrast to some of the shortcomings of terms like 'neurotypical' (such as its underlying assumption that neurodivergent experiences are an anomaly, ''i.e.'' not typical), a growing group of advocates in the neurodivergent movement prefer other terms such as "neuroconforming".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Legault |first1=Mylène |last2=Bourdon |first2=Jean-Nicolas |last3=Poirier |first3=Pierre |date=2021-12-01 |title=From neurodiversity to neurodivergence: the role of epistemic and cognitive marginalization |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-021-03356-5 |journal=Synthese |language=en |volume=199 |issue=5 |pages=12843–12868 |doi=10.1007/s11229-021-03356-5 |issn=1573-0964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Double empathy problem theory ==
{{Main|Double empathy problem}}
[[File:Double empathy problem image.jpg|thumb|Both autistic and non-autistic people can find it difficult to empathize with each other. The fact that both people in the interaction have trouble with understanding and empathy is why the theory is called the "double empathy problem".&lt;ref name="double-empathy-why"&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Crompton CJ, DeBrabander K, Heasman B, Milton D, Sasson NJ |date=2021-05-11 |title=Double Empathy: Why Autistic People Are Often Misunderstood |journal=[[Frontiers for Young Minds]] |volume=9 |pages=554875 |doi=10.3389/frym.2021.554875 |issn=2296-6846 |doi-access=free |hdl=20.500.11820/94ee032a-6103-470a-bc06-08337dd6b512 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The theory of the double empathy problem argues that autistic people do not lack empathy as often supposed by people who see autism as pathological. Rather, the experiences of autistic and non-autistic people are so different that it is hard for one to understand how the other thinks; for example, non-autistic people may not understand when an autistic person is overwhelmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=DeThorne L |date=April 1, 2020 |title=Revealing the Double Empathy Problem: It's not that autistic* people lack empathy.

It was originally conceived in 2012 by autistic scholar [[Damian Milton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Milton DE |date=October 1, 2012 |title=On the ontological status of autism: the 'double empathy problem' |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/09687599.2012.710008 |journal=Disability &amp; Society |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=883–887 |doi=10.1080/09687599.2012.710008 |s2cid=54047060 |issn=0968-7599 |access-date=April 5, 2023 |archive-date=May 13, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240513164401/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09687599.2012.710008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; One study comparing the conversations and socialization of autistic groups, non-autistic groups, and mixed groups found that autistic people were more able to build rapport with other autistic people than with non-autistic people, and at a level similar to the purely non-autistic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rifai OM, Fletcher-Watson S, Jiménez-Sánchez L, Crompton CJ | title = Investigating Markers of Rapport in Autistic and Nonautistic Interactions | journal = [[Autism in Adulthood]] | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–11 | date = March 2022 | pmid = 36600904 | pmc = 8992924 | doi = 10.1089/aut.2021.0017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The double empathy problem theory implies there is no simple fix that can help each group better empathize with each other. Moreover, attempting to "treat" an autistic person by teaching them to empathize with non-autistic people could generate mental health issues and feelings of inferiority and self-blame. The same risks do not apply when seeking to teach non-autistic people, because their allistic neurology is not stigmatized. The advantage of the theory is reducing pathologization of autistic people by identifying that everyone struggles to empathize with different neurotypes. It can also help neurotypical individuals to better understand how neurodivergent people think and empathize and to recognize their own limitations in empathizing with autistic people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The double empathy problem |url=https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/professional-practice/double-empathy |access-date=June 3, 2023 |website=www.autism.org.uk |language=en |archive-date=March 30, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230330104453/https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/professional-practice/double-empathy |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vikram Jaswal|Jaswal]] and Akhtar (2019) highlight the difference between ''being'' socially uninterested and ''appearing'' socially uninterested, and challenge preconceived notions of a lack of social motivation. For example, testimonies from autistic individuals report that avoiding eye contact serves an important function of helping them to concentrate during conversation, and should not be interpreted as expressing social disinterest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaswal VK, Akhtar N | title = Being versus appearing socially uninterested: Challenging assumptions about social motivation in autism | journal = The Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 42 | pages = e82 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29914590 | doi = 10.1017/s0140525x18001826 | s2cid = 49305763 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of neurodiversity strive to reconceptualize autism and related conditions in society by acknowledging that neurodiversity does not require a cure, changing the language from the current "condition, disease, disorder, or illness"-based nomenclature, "broadening the understanding of healthy or independent living", acknowledging new types of autonomy, and giving neurodivergent individuals more control over their treatment, including the type, timing, and whether there should be treatment at all.&lt;ref name="article"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fenton A, Krahn T | title = Autism, neurodiversity and equality beyond the'normal. | journal = Journal of Ethics in Mental Health | date = November 2007 | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 1–6 | url = http://www.jemh.ca/issues/v2n2/documents/JEMH_V2N2_Theme_Article2_Neurodiversity_Autism.pdf | access-date = August 9, 2013 | archive-date = April 28, 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190428185724/https://jemh.ca/issues/v2n2/documents/JEMH_V2N2_Theme_Article2_Neurodiversity_Autism.pdf | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomsbury" /&gt;

They found that, although all of the students reported uniformly difficult schooling careers involving exclusion, abuse, and bullying, those who viewed themselves from the "difference" view (41% of the study cohort) "indicated higher academic self-esteem and confidence in their abilities and many (73%) expressed considerable career ambitions with positive and clear goals".&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Many of these students reported gaining this view of themselves through contact with neurodiversity advocates in online support groups.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

Neurodiversity advocate [[John Elder Robison]] argues that the disabilities and strengths conferred by neurological differences may be mutually inseparable. "When 99 neurologically identical people fail to solve a problem, it's often the 1% fellow who's different who holds the key. Yet that person may be disabled or disadvantaged most or all of the time. To neurodiversity proponents, people are disabled because they are at the edges of the bell curve, not because they are sick or broken."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What Is Neurodiversity?|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/my-life-aspergers/201310/what-is-neurodiversity|access-date=September 17, 2020|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US|archive-date=May 13, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240513164340/https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/my-life-aspergers/201310/what-is-neurodiversity|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emotional experiences of neurodivergent students in higher education depend on a combination of factors, including the type of disability, the level of impairment, and the student's access to resources and accommodations.&lt;ref name=":111"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Clouder |first1=Lynn |last2=Karakus |first2=Mehmet |last3=Cinotti |first3=Alessia |last4=Ferreyra |first4=María Virginia |last5=Fierros |first5=Genoveva Amador |last6=Rojo |first6=Patricia |date=2020-10-01 |title=Neurodiversity in higher education: a narrative synthesis |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10734-020-00513-6 |journal=Higher Education |language=en |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=757–778 |doi=10.1007/s10734-020-00513-6 |issn=1573-174X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common difficulty for neurodivergent students is maintaining social relationships, which can give rise to [[loneliness]], [[anxiety]], and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name=":111" /&gt; There is also the added stress and difficulty of transitioning into higher education, as well as the responsibilities and task management required in college.&lt;ref name=":111" /&gt; Many neurodivergent students may find that they need added support.&lt;ref name=":111" /&gt; As for academics, neurodivergent students may experience difficulties in learning, [[Executive functions|executive function]], managing peer relationships in the classroom or in group work, and other impairments that can affect academic performance and success in higher education.&lt;ref name=":111" /&gt; However, neurodivergent students may find that their differences are a strength and an integral part of their new social roles as adults.&lt;ref name=":111" /&gt;

=== Higher education institutions ===
The typical curriculum and format of higher education may pose as a challenge for neurodivergent students, and a lack of support and flexibility from staff may further complicate the university experience.&lt;ref name=":112"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Clouder |first1=Lynn |last2=Karakus |first2=Mehmet |last3=Cinotti |first3=Alessia |last4=Ferreyra |first4=María Virginia |last5=Fierros |first5=Genoveva Amador |last6=Rojo |first6=Patricia |date=2020-10-01 |title=Neurodiversity in higher education: a narrative synthesis |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10734-020-00513-6 |journal=Higher Education |language=en |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=757–778 |doi=10.1007/s10734-020-00513-6 |issn=1573-174X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, reasonable adjustments are available to students who disclose their disabilities.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt; However, these adjustments and/or accommodations may put an emphasis on academics, and less on the various challenges of higher education on neurodivergent students.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt; For instance, neurodivergent students in higher education also report a need for non-academic supports, such as social mentorships and resources for strength-based interventions in order to further assist neurodivergent students in the social aspects of college life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Clouder L, Karakus M, Cinotti A, Ferreyra MV, Fierros GA, Rojo P |date=2020-06-07 |title=Neurodiversity in higher education: a narrative synthesis |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10734-020-00513-6 |url-status=live |journal=Higher Education |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=757–778 |doi=10.1007/s10734-020-00513-6 |issn=0018-1560 |s2cid=219680857 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240513164351/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10734-020-00513-6 |archive-date=May 13, 2024 |access-date=February 25, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, career preparation that is specifically targeted for neurodivergent students is lacking. There are several programs, such as [[supported employment]], that exist to help assist neurodivergent individuals in finding and obtaining a job. However,  many of these programs do not exist in schools. This can make it difficult for neurodivergent students to find a career path that they feel is attainable for them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Another consideration is the implementation of a universal design approach (UDL) when building learning spaces or communal areas that considers the needs of neurodivergent students. A UDL design incorporates a design that accommodates the needs of all students, including the neurodivergent population.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Densberger |first=Kathryn |date=2021 |title=Book Review: Supporting Neurodiverse College Student Success: A Guide for Librarians, Student Support Services, and Academic Learning Environments |url=https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?p=PROF&amp;u=birm97026&amp;id=GALE%7CA679898761&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;aty=ip |journal=The Learning Assistance Review |volume=26 |issue=2 |via=National College Learning Center Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an article published in 2023, universities and post-secondary establishments would show more tolerance towards neurodivergent people. A tolerant environment can increase autonomy, leading to kindness and understanding among students.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hamilton |first1=Lorna G. |last2=Petty |first2=Stephanie |date=2023-02-16 |title=Compassionate pedagogy for neurodiversity in higher education: A conceptual analysis |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |language=English |volume=14 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1093290 |doi-access=free |issn=1664-1078 |pmc=9978378 |pmid=36874864}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher education institutions offer counseling and support services to students. However, neurodivergent students face particular challenges that impair their ability to receive consistent support and care. Additionally, counseling and support services face a lack of funding, personnel, and specialists that can adequately support neurodivergent students. Overall, these services work for some students and not for others.&lt;ref name=":113"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Clouder |first1=Lynn |last2=Karakus |first2=Mehmet |last3=Cinotti |first3=Alessia |last4=Ferreyra |first4=María Virginia |last5=Fierros |first5=Genoveva Amador |last6=Rojo |first6=Patricia |date=2020-10-01 |title=Neurodiversity in higher education: a narrative synthesis |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10734-020-00513-6 |journal=Higher Education |language=en |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=757–778 |doi=10.1007/s10734-020-00513-6 |issn=1573-174X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nachman and colleagues reviewed several articles published by two-year community colleges and found some discrepancies in the way that they perceived and categorized "disabled" students and "non-disabled" students. They found that all of the articles were attempting to normalize disability. Many of them put distinct separation between typical and atypical learners as well as their potential academic achievement. Nachman also found that many of the articles showed a lack of autonomy for neurodivergent students. They had little power in regard to academic choices and classroom management.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Nachman, Brett Ranon, and Kirsten R. Brown.

In a [[systematic review]] that considered developmental [[dyslexia]] as "an expression of neurodiversity", it was suggested that neurodiversity is not yet an established concept in the workplace, and therefore, support from social relationships and work accommodations is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Beer J, Heerkens Y, Engels J, van der Klink J | title = Factors relevant to work participation from the perspective of adults with developmental dyslexia: a systematic review of qualitative studies | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 1083 | date = May 2022 | pmid = 35642026 | pmc = 9158268 | doi = 10.1186/s12889-022-13436-x | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, another systematic review that focused on [[pharmacological]] and combined pharmacological/[[psychosocial]] interventions for adults with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] found that there were few workplace-based intervention studies, and suggested that additional research needs to be conducted to figure out how to best support neurodivergent employees in the workplace.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lauder K, McDowall A, Tenenbaum HR |date=2022 |title=A systematic review of interventions to support adults with ADHD at work – Implications from the paucity of context-specific research for theory and practice |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=13 |pages=893469 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2022.893469 |pmc=9443814 |pmid=36072032 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In social media ==
{{NPOV-section|date=August 2024}}
The increase of representation of the neurodiversity movement in the media came about with changes in the technology of the media platforms themselves.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; The recent addition of text-based options on various social media sites allow disabled users to communicate, enjoy, and share at a more accessible rate.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Social media]] has a two-fold benefit to the neurodivergent community: it can help spread awareness and pioneer the neurodiversity movement, and it can also allow members of the communities themselves to connect.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite conference | vauthors = Wang T, Garfield M, Wisniewski P, Page X |chapter=Benefits and Challenges for Social Media Users on the Autism Spectrum |date=October 17, 2020 |book-title=Conference Companion Publication of the 2020 on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing |pages=419–424 |location=New York |publisher=Association for Computing Machinery |doi=10.1145/3406865.3418322 |isbn=978-1-4503-8059-1 |title=Conference Companion Publication of the 2020 on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gabarron E, Dechsling A, Skafle I, Nordahl-Hansen A | title = Discussions of Asperger Syndrome on Social Media: Content and Sentiment Analysis on Twitter | journal = JMIR Formative Research | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = e32752 | date = March 2022 | pmid = 35254265 | pmc = 8938830 | doi = 10.2196/32752 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social media as a platform ===
Media platforms allow the connection of individuals of similar backgrounds to find a community of support with one another.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; Online networking and connections allows for the user to decide their level of comfort with interactions, and allow them to retain control of a relationship with another user. For the neurodivergent community, the use of social media to create relationships has proven a useful tool for those with difficulty in social situations.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Brownlow C, Bertilsdotter Rosqvist H, O'Dell L |date=November 2, 2015 |title=Exploring the potential for social networking among people with autism: challenging dominant ideas of 'friendship' |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Disability Research |language=en |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=188–193 |doi=10.1080/15017419.2013.859174 |issn=1745-3011|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; By connecting neurodivergent users, media platforms provide "[[safe space]]s" that are helpful in forming relationships.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Some media developers have created platforms such as Blossom, which are designed specifically to connect neurodivergent users and families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=January 26, 2022 |title=Blossom: An App for the Neurodiverse Community |url=https://mittalsouthasiainstitute.harvard.edu/2022/01/blossom-app/ |access-date=April 11, 2022 |website=The Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute |archive-date=May 29, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220529021500/https://mittalsouthasiainstitute.harvard.edu/2022/01/blossom-app/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social media as a driving force ===
Social media also allows users to spread awareness about the [[Autism rights movement|neurodiversity movement]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Calhoun AJ, Gold JA | title = 'I Feel Like I Know Them': the Positive Effect of Celebrity Self-disclosure of Mental Illness | journal = Academic Psychiatry | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 237–241 | date = April 2020 | pmid = 32100256 | doi = 10.1007/s40596-020-01200-5 | s2cid = 211479198 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing awareness about disorders has been shown to increase the amount of factual information spread.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The spread of information through social media exposure can assist the neurodiversity movement in educating the public about understanding disabilities such as [[autism]] and sifting out misinformation.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; By sharing neurodivergent experiences from a first hand perspective, social media can educate the public and destigmatize certain disorders, but negative portrayals of neurodivergence can have an obstructive impact on members of the community.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stuart H | title = Media portrayal of mental illness and its treatments: what effect does it have on people with mental illness? | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 99–106 | date = February 1, 2006 | pmid = 16478286 | doi = 10.2165/00023210-200620020-00002 | s2cid = 21633246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Challenges within media ===
Although representation of the neurodivergent community has grown with the help of social media platforms, those users are often criticized and misunderstood.&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Bitman N |date=February 11, 2022 |title="Authentic" digital inclusion?

Some have reported needing to conform to the mainstream view of their disability to be seen as "authentic" users.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; Doing so has indirectly made it more difficult for neurodivergent users to grow platforms.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Salisbury M, Pooley J |date=January 20, 2017 |title=The #nofilter Self: The Contest for Authenticity among Social Networking Sites, 2002–2016 |journal=Social Sciences |language=en |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=10 |doi=10.3390/socsci6010010 |issn=2076-0760 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-disabled users evaluating the authenticity of neurodivergent users based on stereotypes shows that the neurodiversity movement has not reached its goal of inclusion.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

== Clinical setting ==
=== Medicine and healthcare ===
Medical and healthcare professionals have begun to acknowledge neurodivergence among employees.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Duong D, Vogel L | title = Untapped potential: embracing neurodiversity in medicine | journal = CMAJ | volume = 194 | issue = 27 | pages = E951–E952 | date = July 2022 | pmid = 35851534 | pmc = 9299741 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.1096006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Im DS, Tamarelli CM | title = Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Medical Learners and Physicians and a Potentially Helpful Educational Tool | journal = Advances in Medical Education and Practice | volume = 14 | pages = 435–442 | date = 2023 | pmid = 37131931 | pmc = 10149068 | doi = 10.2147/AMEP.S398196 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, more groups are being created that are centered around advocacy and peer support among medical and healthcare professionals who associate themselves with neurodiversity, such as the Autistic Doctors International created by Dr. Mary Doherty.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another approach is the implementation of a 5-minute video summary (5MVS) for medical learners and physicians who have [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; It consists of a 5-minute recorded video summary in which an engaging speaker presents the relevant information from a scientific article about ADHD using a brief [[PowerPoint]] presentation shared using videoconferencing technology. The researchers state that providing this educational tool for helping medical learners and physicians with ADHD acquire relevant information from scientific articles could help in addressing their inattention, impulsivity and/or hyperactivity, and improve their development of critical appraisal skills when working in healthcare.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Similarly, healthcare systems may benefit from hiring neurodivergent individuals to gain a unique perspective when caring for patients.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Embracing Neurodiversity in Our Health Systems |url=https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/aap-voices/embracing-neurodiversity-in-our-health-systems/ |access-date=2023-10-26 |website=www.aap.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some healthcare staff agree that inviting neurodivergent individuals to join patient advisory groups or hiring them as staff are essential steps to acceptance and integration in the workforce. Neurodivergent people's unique strengths can be vital to health system innovation and improvement efforts.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; One example of the push toward this is the Stanford Neurodiversity Project, in which one of their goals is to discover the strengths of neurodivergent individuals and make use of their talents to increase innovation and productivity of their society, such as working in the field of healthcare and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Stanford Neurodiversity Project |url=https://med.stanford.edu/neurodiversity.html |access-date=2023-10-26 |website=Stanford Neurodiversity Project |language=sm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurodiversity has also recently been investigated as a new way of working within neurodevelopmental clinics in the UK.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dunn ZD, Gowda A, Horsfall Turner IC | title = The viability of a proposed psychoeducational neurodiversity approach in children services: The PANDA (the Portsmouth alliance's neuro-diversity approach) | journal = Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 198–212 | date = January 2024 | pmid = 37311174 | doi = 10.1177/13591045231184121 | s2cid = 259153165 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A team of researchers in Portsmouth, England, have created an approach in aiding neurodivergent individuals known as PANDA, or the Portsmouth Alliance Neurodiversity Approach. This approach may help medical and healthcare professionals facilitate understanding, communication and early support for children who may identify as being neurodivergent.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Therapy ===
Neurodiversity and the role it plays in therapeutic settings has been a central focal point in recent years. Many therapists and mental health professionals have pushed for more inclusive psychotherapeutic frameworks appropriate for neurodivergent individuals.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chapman R, Botha M | title = Neurodivergence-informed therapy | journal = Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology | volume = 65 | issue = 3 | pages = 310–317 | date = March 2023 | pmid = 36082483 | doi = 10.1111/dmcn.15384 | s2cid = 252161995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web |vauthors=Healey G |date=2023 |title=What is neurodiversity affirming therapy? |url=https://www.lawsonpsychology.com.au/neurodiversity-affirming-therapy/ |access-date=2023-10-22 |website=Lawson Clinical Psychology |language=en-GB |archive-date=November 28, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231128164222/https://www.lawsonpsychology.com.au/neurodiversity-affirming-therapy/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is neurodivergence-informed therapy, which reframes dysfunction as interconnectedness among society rather than strictly individual, advocating for acceptance and pride in the neurodiversity community, and the push for therapists to pursue [[humility]] regarding the knowledge and education associated with individuals who identify as neurodivergent.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Similarly, neurodiversity affirming therapy supports neurodivergent differences, rather than viewing them as something that should be "cured", and to offer ways to support the individual with difficult areas, while still appreciating their needs and strengths.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Therapeutic programs and interventions are also being investigated for the neurodivergent community.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McDonald TA, Lalani S, Chen I, Cotton CM, MacDonald L, Boursoulian LJ, Wang J, Malow BA | title = Appropriateness, Acceptability, and Feasibility of a Neurodiversity-Based Self-determination Program for Autistic Adults | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 53 | issue = 8 | pages = 2933–2953 | date = August 2023 | pmid = 35618972 | pmc = 9934918 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-022-05598-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manning C, Scerif G | title = Understanding perceptual decisions by studying development and neurodiversity | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 300–306 | date = August 2023 | pmid = 37547284 | pmc = 7614885 | doi = 10.1177/09637214231162369 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Self-determination]] programs to help neurodivergent individuals achieve goals in their life has been founded to be successful, with neurodivergent participants finding it to be "appropriate, acceptable, and feasible".&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Various approaches (e.g., eye-tracking, longitudinal data, computational modeling) in understanding perceptual decision-making in neurodivergent individuals are also being studied and the implications it may have in the therapeutic environment in working with the neurodivergent population.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

Another form of therapeutic intervention in that has been investigated in neurodivergent individuals is the use of Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBIs).&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schuck RK, Tagavi DM, Baiden KM, Dwyer P, Williams ZJ, Osuna A, Ferguson EF, Jimenez Muñoz M, Poyser SK, Johnson JF, Vernon TW | title = Neurodiversity and Autism Intervention: Reconciling Perspectives Through a Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Intervention Framework | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 52 | issue = 10 | pages = 4625–4645 | date = October 2022 | pmid = 34643863 | pmc = 9508016 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-021-05316-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; NDBIs have been shown to have positive effects on language and social-communication while, at the same time, respecting individuals’ needs and autonomy. One of the key goals in this type of intervention is putting the focus of therapy on the neurodivergent individual themselves in the creation of intervention goals, procedures, and outcomes. In doing so, they are likely to be seen as more acceptable, useful, and effective to that individual.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

In addition to support from neurodiversity advocates for affirming therapies, concerns have been raised about the role of certain approaches such as [[applied behavior analysis]]. Neurodivergent individuals and activists tend to emphasize the tendency of these interventions to set a goals-focused approach that, to a neurodivergent patient, might seem to center societal participation rather than the goals of the individual. In this sense, concerns from neurodivergent individuals tends to argue that these interventions aim to enforce conformity with expectations of society rather than addressing the needs of the person receiving the treatment.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leaf JB, Cihon JH, Leaf R, McEachin J, Liu N, Russell N, Unumb L, Shapiro S, Khosrowshahi D | title = Concerns About ABA-Based Intervention: An Evaluation and Recommendations | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 52 | issue = 6 | pages = 2838–2853 | date = June 2022 | pmid = 34132968 | pmc = 9114057 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-021-05137-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; While a large body of research on the role of ABA seems to support its efficacy in long term cognitive and behavioral outcomes, there remains concerns regarding long-term mental health impacts and with the measures used in determining social validity by those who have raised these concerns. In addition to advocates from within the neurodivergent community, some behavioral analysts have begun to reconsider the role of these therapies with the context of a neurodiversity framework.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

== Reception and controversies ==
{{Further|Controversies in autism#Advocacy initiatives}}

The neurodiversity paradigm is controversial in autism advocacy. The dominant [[paradigm]], the [[medical model of disability]] holds that neurodivergent individuals have medical conditions which should be treated. The neurodiversity paradigm, under the understanding that differences in neural function are natural variations in function, suggests that not all conditions that would be classified as neurodivergent need medical intervention. A prevalent criticism about application of the neurodiversity paradigm to autism comes from the understanding that{{snd}}even with a framework of natural variance that neurodiversity includes{{snd}}individuals with functional difficulties would continue to have challenges. Some critics of the neurodiversity paradigm, such as family members that are responsible for the care of an autistic individual, consider it detached from the needs of individuals that would continue to be functionally disabled through the frame of natural variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dwyer |first=Patrick |date=2022-02-22 |title=The Neurodiversity Approach(es): What Are They and What Do They Mean for Researchers? |url=https://doi.org/10.1159/000523723 |journal=Human Development |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=73–92 |doi=10.1159/000523723 |issn=0018-716X |pmc=9261839 |pmid=36158596 |access-date=April 5, 2024 |archive-date=May 13, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240513164625/https://karger.com/hde/article/66/2/73/828432/The-Neurodiversity-Approach-es-What-Are-They-and |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common criticism is that the neurodiversity paradigm is too widely encompassing and that its conception should exclude those whose functioning is more severely impaired. In response, autistic advocate Nick Walker suggested that neurodiversity refers specifically to "pervasive neurocognitive differences [...] intimately related to the formation and constitution of the self", in contrast to medical conditions such as [[epilepsy]].&lt;sup&gt;[''[[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view#Due and undue weight|undue weight?]]  – [[Talk:Neurodiversity#undue|discuss]]'']&lt;/sup&gt;

"Critiques of the Neurodiversity Movement", a 2020 review, raised two concerns regarding the term ''neurotypical'':

* Many people who do not have an autism diagnosis have autistic traits (known by researchers as the "broad autism phenotype"), so there is no clear bimodal distribution separating people with and without autism. In reality there are not two distinct populations, one "neurotypical" and one "neurodivergent".&lt;ref name="Russell202"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Autistic Community and the Neurodiversity Movement |vauthors=Russell G |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2020 |isbn=978-981-13-8437-0 |veditors=Kapp S |location=Singapore |pages=287–303 |chapter=Critiques of the Neurodiversity Movement |doi=10.1007/978-981-13-8437-0_21 |oclc=1127055276 |access-date=May 13, 2022 |chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-981-13-8437-0_21.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211028053840/https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-981-13-8437-0_21.pdf |archive-date=October 28, 2021 |url-status=live |s2cid=210483688}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|288}}
* "Neurotypical" was a dubious construct, because there is nobody who could be considered truly neurotypical, and there is no such standard for the human brain.&lt;ref name="Russell202" /&gt;{{rp|290}}
