'''International Women's Day''' ('''IWD'''), originally called '''International Working Women’s Day''', is marked on '''[[March 8]]''' every year.&lt;ref name="international-mens-day.com"&gt;[http://www.international-mens-day.com/IWD_IMD.php Origins and Evolution: Perspectives of Two International Days]&lt;/ref&gt; In different regions the focus of the celebrations ranges from general celebration of respect, appreciation and love towards women to a celebration for women's economic, political and social achievements. Started as a Socialist political event, the holiday blended in the culture of many countries, primarily [[Eastern Europe]], [[Russia]], and the former [[Soviet bloc]]. In many regions, the day lost its political flavour, and became simply an occasion for men to express their love for women in a way somewhat similar to a mixture of [[Mother's Day]] and [[St Valentine's Day]]. In other regions, however, the original political and human rights theme designated by the [[United Nations]] runs strong, and political and social awareness of the struggles of women worldwide are brought out and examined in a hopeful manner.

==History==
[[Image:NSW Builders Labourers march on IWD 1975.jpg|thumb|Female members of the Australian [[Builders Labourers Federation]] march on International Women's Day 1975 in Sydney]]
The first ''national'' Women's Day was observed on 28 February 1909 in the United States following a declaration by the [[Socialist Party of America]].&lt;ref name = "UN"&gt;[http://www.un.org/events/women/iwd/2008/history.shtml United Nations page on the background of the IWD]&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1910, an International Women's Conference was organized to precede the general meeting of the Socialist [[Second International]] in [[Copenhagen]]. Inspired in part by the American socialists, German Socialist Luise Zietz proposed the establishment of an annual 'International Woman's Day' (singular) and was seconded by [[Clara Zetkin]], although no date was specified at that conference.&lt;ref name = "kaplan"&gt;Temma Kaplan, "On the Socialist Origins of International Women's Day", Feminist Studies, 11/1 (Spring, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Delegates (100 women from 17 countries) agreed with the idea as a strategy to promote equal rights, including [[suffrage]], for women.&lt;ref name = "iwd"&gt;[http://www.internationalwomensday.com/about.asp About International Women's Day]&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, on 18 March, 1911, IWD was marked for the first time, by over a million people in [[Austria]], [[Denmark]], [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]]. In the Austro-Hungarian Empire alone, there were 300 demonstrations&lt;ref name = "kaplan" /&gt; In Vienna, women paraded on the [[Ringstrasse]] and carried banners honouring the martyrs of the [[Paris Commune]].&lt;ref name = "kaplan" /&gt; Women demanded that women be given the right to vote and to hold public office. They also protested against employment sex discrimination.&lt;ref name = "UN"/&gt; Americans continued to celebrate National Women's Day on the last Sunday in February.&lt;ref name = "kaplan" /&gt;

In 1913 [[Russian Empire|Russian]] women observed their first International Women's Day on the last Sunday in February (by [[Julian calendar]] then used in Russia). In 1917 demonstrations marking International Women's Day in [[St.Petersburg]] on the last Sunday in February (which fell on 8 March on the [[Gregorian calendar]]) initiated the [[February Revolution]].&lt;ref name = "UN"/&gt;

Following the [[October Revolution]], the [[Bolshevik]] [[Alexandra Kollontai]] persuaded [[Lenin]] to make it an [[Public holiday|official holiday]] in the Soviet Union, and it was established, but was a working day until 1965. On May 8, 1965 by the decree of the [[USSR]] [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] International Women's Day was declared a non working day in the USSR "in commemoration of the outstanding merits of Soviet women in communistic construction, in the defense of their Fatherland during the Great Patriotic War, in their heroism and selflessness at the front and in the rear, and also marking the great contribution of women to strengthening friendship between peoples, and the struggle for peace. But still, women's day must be celebrated as are other holidays."{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

From its official adoption in Russia following the Soviet Revolution in 1917 the holiday was predominantly celebrated in communist and socialist countries. It was celebrated by the communists in China from 1922, and by Spanish communists from 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nelson|first=Jinty|title=International Women’s Day: a centenary to celebrate|url=http://www.historyworkshop.org.uk/international-womens-day-a-centenary-to-celebrate/|publisher=History Workshop Online|accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]] on October 1, 1949 the state council proclaimed on December 23 that March 8 would be made an official holiday with women in China given a half-day off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anniversaries of important events|url=http://www.gov.cn/english/2005-08/10/content_28291.htm|work=China Factfile|publisher=Chinese Government|accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the West, International Women's Day was first observed as a popular event after 1977 when the [[United Nations General Assembly]] invited member states to proclaim March 8 as the [[UN Day]] for Women's Rights and International Peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/womenwatch/feature/iwd/ WomenWatch].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="international-mens-day.com"&gt;[http://www.international-mens-day.com/IWD_IMD.php Origins and Evolution: Perspectives of Two International Days]&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2010 International Women's Day ==

On the occasion of 2010 International Women's Day the ICRC drew attention to the hardship displaced women endure. The displacement of populations is one of the gravest consequences of today's armed conflicts. It affects women in a host of ways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/women-displacement-interview-020310 Women and displacement: strength in adversity] International Committee of the Red Cross.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women displaced by armed conflict – often living alone with their children – are frequently exposed to sexual violence, discrimination and intimidation. Many face poverty and social exclusion as well. International humanitarian law therefore includes specific provisions protecting women, for example when they are pregnant or as mothers of young children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/women-news-040310 International Women's Day: giving a say to displaced women] International Committee of the Red Cross.&lt;/ref&gt;

On this day it is customary for men to give the women in their lives – mothers, wives, girlfriends, daughters, colleagues, etc. – flowers and small gifts. In some countries (such as Bulgaria and Romania) it is also observed as an equivalent of Mother's Day, where children also give small presents to their mothers and grandmothers.&lt;ref name="agentia.org"/&gt;

In Armenia, after the collapse of the Soviet Union celebrations of IWD were abandoned. Instead, April 7 was introduced as state holiday of ‘Beauty and Motherhood’. The new holiday immediately became popular among [[Armenians]], as it commemorates one of the main holidays of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Church]], the [[Annunciation]]. However, people still kept celebrating IWD on March 8 as well. Public discussion held on the topic of two ‘Women’s Days’ in Armenia resulted in the recognition of the so called ‘Women’s Month’ which is the period between March 8 and April 7.

In [[Italy]], to celebrate the day, men give [[Acacia dealbata|yellow mimosas]] to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.repubblica.it/online/societa/otto/otto/otto.html la Repubblica/societa: 8 marzo, niente manifestazione tante feste diverse per le donne].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/2006/c/sezioni/politica/versoelezioni34/ciampidonne/ciampidonne.html Repubblica.it » politica » Festa della donna, parla Ciampi "La parità è ancora lontana"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; Yellow mimosas and chocolate are also one of the most common March 8 presents in [[Russia]] and [[Albania]].

In many countries, such as in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Brazil]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Estonia]], [[Hungary]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Moldova]], [[Montenegro]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Slovenia]], the custom of giving women flowers still prevails. Women also sometimes get gifts from their employers. Schoolchildren often bring gifts for their teachers, too.

In countries like [[Portugal]] groups of women usually celebrate on the night of 8 March in "women-only" dinners and parties.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

In [[Pakistan]] working women in formal and informal sectors celebrate International Women's Day every year to commemorate their ongoing struggle for due rights, despite facing many cultural and religious restrictions. Some women working for change in society use IWM to help the movement for women's rights. In [[Poland]], for instance, every IWD includes large feminist demonstrations in major cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ippf.org/en/News/Intl+news/March+8+in+Poland+Still+Marching+Together+for+Freedom+and+Equality.htm IPPF.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, which was designated as International Women’s Year, the United Nations gave official sanction to, and began sponsoring, International Women's Day.

The 2005 Congress (conference) of the British [[Trades Union Congress]] overwhelmingly approved a resolution calling for IWD to be designated a public holiday in the [[United Kingdom]].

Since 2005, IWD has been celebrated in [[Montevideo]], either on the principal street, 18 de Julio, or alternatively through one of its neighbourhoods. The event has attracted much publicity due to a group of female drummers, [http://www.lamelaza.com/ La Melaza], who have performed each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uruguaynow.com/la_melaza_candombe.php Uruguaynow.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, many events are held by women's groups around the world. The UK-based marketing company [[Aurora (organization)|Aurora]] hosts a free worldwide register of IWD local events &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalwomensday.com Internationalwomensday.com].&lt;/ref&gt; so that women and the media can learn about local activity. Many governments and organizations around the world support IWD.

==Controversies==
In some cases International Women's Day has led to questionable practices that discriminated against men. For example [[Tower Hamlets Council]] closed off one of its libraries to all males to "celebrate" the occasion, forcing them to travel elsewhere, going as far as even banning male staff from the premises.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelondonpaper.com/cs/Satellite/london/lcsearch/article/1157146635813?packedargs=suffix%3DArticleController Thelondonpaper.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Czech Republic]] (then part of Czechoslovak Socialist Republic), huge Soviet style celebrations were held annually. After the fall of Communism, the holiday, generally considered to be one of the major symbols of the old regime, fell into obscurity. International Women's Day was re-established as an official "important day" by the Parliament only recently, on the proposal of the Social Democrats and Communists. This has provoked some controversy as a large part of the public as well as the political right see the holiday as a relic of the nation's Communist past. In 2008, the conservative Catholic People's Party's deputies unsuccessfully proposed the abolition of the holiday. However, some non-government organizations consider the official recognition of International Women's Day as an important reminder of women's role in the society. Still, unlike in the past, the holiday is no longer observed by the general public in any significant way.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

International Women's Day sparked violence in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]] on March 4, 2007, when police beat hundreds of men and women who were planning a rally. Police arrested dozens of women and some were released after several days of solitary confinement and interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6426087.stm BBC.CO.UK].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shadi Sadr]] Mahbubeh Abbasgholizadeh and several more community activists were released on March 19, 2007, ending a fifteen day hunger strike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/03/07/iran15452.htm HRW.ORG].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apocrypha==

A popular [[apocrypha]]l story which surfaced in French Communist circles&lt;ref name="emancipatie.nl"&gt;Temma Kaplan, On the Socialist Origins of International Women's Day, in: Feminist Studies, 11, 1985, S. 163-171. ([http://www.emancipatie.nl/_documenten/vvnl/doc/2006/KaplanSocialistOrigins.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Françoise Picq 1982"&gt;Liliane Kandel / Françoise Picq, Le Mythe des origines à propos de la journée internationale des femmes, in: La Revue d'en face, 12, 1982, S. 67-80.&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that women from [[clothing]] and [[textile]] factories had staged a protest on 8 March 1857 in [[New York, New York|New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;Angela Howard Zophy, Handbook of American women's history, Garland, 1990, 187.&lt;/ref&gt; The story alleged that garment workers were protesting against very poor working conditions and low wages and were attacked and dispersed by [[police]]. It was claimed that this event led to a rally in commemoration of its 50th anniversary in 1907. Temma Kaplan&lt;ref name="emancipatie.nl"/&gt; explains that "neither event seems to have taken place, but many Europeans think March 8, 1907 inaugurated International Women's Day."&lt;ref name="emancipatie.nl"/&gt; Speculating about the origins of this 1857 legend, Liliane Kandel and Françoise Picq suggested it was likely that (in recent times) some felt it opportune to detach International Women's Day from its basis in Soviet history and ascribe to it a more "international" origin which could be painted as more ancient than Bolshevism and more spontaneous than a decision of Congress or the initiative of those women affiliated to the Party.&lt;ref name="international-mens-day.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Françoise Picq 1982"/&gt;
