'''International Women's Day''' ('''IWD'''), originally called '''International Working Women's Day''', is celebrated on March 8 every year.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/feature/iwd/history.html | title=UN WomenWatch: International Women's Day – History | publisher=UN.org | accessdate=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In different regions the focus of the celebrations ranges from general celebration of respect, appreciation and love towards women for their economic, political and [[economic, social and cultural rights|social achievements]].  The most effective Woman's day was the [[1975 Icelandic women's strike]] which paved the way for the first female president in the world and the best example for women's equality the world has seen. 

In some regions, the day lost its political flavor and became simply an occasion for people to express their love for women in a way somewhat similar to a mixture of [[Mother's Day]] and [[Valentine's Day]]. In other regions however, the political and human rights theme designated by the [[United Nations]] runs strong political and social awareness of the struggles of women worldwide are brought out and examined in a hopeful manner. Some people celebrate the day by wearing [[purple ribbon]]s.

The earliest celebration was held as a [[socialism|Socialist]] [[politics|political]] event in 1909. It blended the culture of many countries primarily in Europe, especially those in the [[Soviet Bloc]].&lt;ref name="ruthchild 2012"&gt;Rochelle Goldberg Ruthchild, "From West to East: International Women’s Day, the First Decade”, ''Aspasia: The International Yearbook of Central, Eastern, and Southeastern European Women's and Gender History'', vol. 6 (2012): 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Declared a national holiday in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1917, it spread to other nearby countries. It is now celebrated in many [[Eastern world|Eastern]] countries.

[[File:Zetkin luxemburg1910.jpg|thumb|[[Clara Zetkin]] and [[Rosa Luxemburgo|Rosa Luxemburg]] in January 1910]]

The earliest Women's Day observance was held on February 28, 1909, in New York. It was organized by the [[Socialist Party of America]] in remembrance of the 1908 strike of the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union|International Ladies Garment Worker's Union]].&lt;ref name="unevents"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/events/women/iwd/2008/history.shtml |title=United Nations page on the background of the IWD |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no specific strike happening on March 8, despite later claims.&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt;

In August 1910, an [[International Socialist Women's Conferences#Copenhagen 1910|International Women's Conference]] was organized to precede the general meeting of the Socialist [[Second International]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name="ruthchild 2012" /&gt; Inspired in part by the American socialists, German Socialist [[Luise Zietz]] proposed the establishment of an annual International Woman's Day (singular) and was seconded by fellow socialist and later communist leader [[Clara Zetkin]], although no date was specified at that conference.&lt;ref name="kaplan"&gt;Temma Kaplan, "On the Socialist Origins of International Women's Day", Feminist Studies, 11/1 (Spring, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= History of International Women's Day |url= http://www.un.org/womenwatch/feature/iwd/history.html |publisher= United Nations |accessdate= May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delegates (100 women from 17 countries) agreed with the idea as a strategy to promote equal rights including [[suffrage]] for women.&lt;ref name="iwd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalwomensday.com/About|title=About International Women's Day |publisher=Internationalwomensday.com |date=March 8, 1917 |accessdate=February 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year on March 19, 1911 IWD was marked for the first time, by over a million people in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland.&lt;ref name="unevents" /&gt; In the Austro-Hungarian Empire alone, there were 300 demonstrations.&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt; In Vienna, women paraded on the [[Ringstrasse]] and carried banners honouring the martyrs of the [[Paris Commune]].&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt; Women demanded that they be given the [[right to vote]] and to hold public office. They also protested against employment sex discrimination.&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt; Americans continued to celebrate National Women's Day on the last Sunday in February.&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt;

[[File:NSW Builders Labourers march on IWD 1975.jpg|thumb|Female members of the Australian [[Builders Labourers Federation]] march on International Women's Day 1975 in Sydney]]

In 1913 [[Russian Empire|Russian]] women observed their first International Women's Day on the last Saturday in February (by [[Julian calendar]] then used in Russia).&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt;

Although there were some women-led strikes, marches, and other protests in the years leading up to 1914, none of them happened on March 8.&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt; In 1914 International Women's Day was held on March 8, possibly because that day was a Sunday, and now it is always held on March 8 in all countries.&lt;ref name="mmf1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mmf2010.info/our-action/le-8-mars-2013-journee-internationale-des-femmes-a-la-recherche-de-la-memoire-perdue |title=8th of March – International woman's day: in search of the lost memory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313064904/http://www.mmf2010.info/our-action/le-8-mars-2013-journee-internationale-des-femmes-a-la-recherche-de-la-memoire-perdue |archivedate=March 13, 2011|deadurl=yes |accessdate=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1914 observance of the Day in Germany was dedicated to women's right to vote, which German women did not win until 1918.&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/suffrage.htm |title=Women's Suffrage |publisher=Inter-Parliamentary Union |accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In London there was a march from Bow to [[Trafalgar Square]] in support of women's suffrage on March 8, 1914. Sylvia Pankhurst was arrested in front of [[Charing Cross]] station on her way to speak in Trafalgar Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suffragist Disorders|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/archive/article/1914-03-09/5/1.html#start%3D1785-01-01%26end%3D1985-12-31%26terms%3D%22Sylvia%20Pankhurst%22%20arrested%26back%3D/tto/archive/find/%252522Sylvia+Pankhurst%252522+arrested/w:1785-01-01%7E1985-12-31/o:date/4%26prev%3D/tto/archive/frame/goto/%252522Sylvia+Pankhurst%252522+arrested/w:1785-01-01%7E1985-12-31/o:date/32%26next%3D/tto/archive/frame/goto/%252522Sylvia+Pankhurst%252522+arrested/w:1785-01-01%7E1985-12-31/o:date/34|accessdate=May 9, 2014|newspaper=The Times|date=March 9, 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917 demonstrations marking International Women's Day in [[Saint Petersburg]] on the last Thursday in February (which fell on March 8 on the [[Gregorian calendar]]) initiated the [[February Revolution]].&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt; Women in Saint Petersburg went on strike that day for "Bread and Peace"&amp;nbsp;– demanding the end of World War I, an end to Russian food shortages, and the end of czarism.&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt; [[Leon Trotsky]] wrote, "23 February (8th March) was International Woman's Day and meetings and actions were foreseen. But we did not imagine that this 'Women's Day' would inaugurate the revolution. Revolutionary actions were foreseen but without date. But in morning, despite the orders to the contrary, textile workers left their work in several factories and sent delegates to ask for support of the strike… which led to mass strike... all went out into the streets."&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt;

Following the [[October Revolution]], the [[Bolshevik]] [[Alexandra Kollontai]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]] made it an [[Public holiday|official holiday]] in the Soviet Union, and it was established, but was a working day until 1965. On May 8, 1965 by the decree of the [[USSR]] [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] International Women's Day was declared a non-working day in the USSR "in commemoration of the outstanding merits of Soviet women in communistic construction, in the defense of their Fatherland during the Great Patriotic War, in their heroism and selflessness at the front and in the rear, and also marking the great contribution of women to strengthening friendship between peoples, and the struggle for peace. But still, women's day must be celebrated as are other holidays."

From its official adoption in Russia following the Soviet Revolution in 1917 the holiday was predominantly celebrated in communist and socialist countries. It was celebrated by the communists in China from 1922, and by Spanish communists from 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nelson|first=Jinty|title=International Women's Day: a centenary to celebrate|url=http://www.historyworkshop.org.uk/international-womens-day-a-centenary-to-celebrate/|publisher=History Workshop Online|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949 the state council proclaimed on December 23 that March 8 would be made an official holiday with women in China given a half-day off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anniversaries of important events|url=http://www.gov.cn/english/2005-08/10/content_28291.htm|work=China Factfile|publisher=Chinese Government|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, International Women's Day was first observed as a popular event after 1977 when the [[United Nations General Assembly]] invited member states to proclaim March 8 as the [[UN Day]] for [[women's rights]] and [[world peace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/feature/iwd/ |title=WomenWatch: International Women's Day |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; But women of Eastern European origins in North America were celebrating International Women's Day decades earlier than that.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4555737/ukrainiancanaadian_women_mark/ "Ukrainian Women's Organization Marks Women's 'May Day'"] ''Winnipeg Tribune'' (March 10, 1937): 10. via [[Newspapers.com]]{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, some Western countries marked the date with an emphasis on women's contributions to the war effort and to the defeat of [[Fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4555657/international_womens_day_celebration/ "International Day Celebrated"] ''Sydney Morning Herald'' (March 8, 1943): 3. via [[Newspapers.com]]{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] praised such celebrations of women's worldwide unity in her "[[My Day]]" column in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Roosevelt, [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4555774/eleanor_roosevelt_writes_about/ "My Day"] ''Ottawa Journal'' (January 13, 1944): 19. via [[Newspapers.com]]{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IWD 2010 ===

On the occasion of 2010 International Women's Day the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) drew attention to the hardships displaced women endure. The displacement of populations is one of the gravest consequences of today's armed conflicts. It affects women in a host of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/women-displacement-interview-020310 |title=Women and displacement: strength in adversity |publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross |date=March 2, 2010 |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egypt, however, the day was a step back for women.

On the occasion of International Women's Day 2012, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] called for more action to help the mothers and wives of people who have gone missing during armed conflict. The vast majority of people who go missing in connection with conflict are men. As well as the anguish of not knowing what has happened to the missing husband or son, many of these women face economic and practical difficulties. The ICRC underlined the duty of parties to a conflict to search for the missing and provide information to the families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/news-release/2012/women-day-news-2012.htm Helping women take matters into their own hands] International Committee of the Red Cross&lt;/ref&gt;

In Armenia, after the collapse of the Soviet Union celebrations of IWD were abandoned. Instead, April 7 was introduced as state holiday of 'Beauty and Motherhood'. The new holiday immediately became popular among [[Armenians]], as it commemorates one of the main holidays of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Church]], the [[Annunciation]]. However, people still kept celebrating IWD on March 8 as well. Public discussion held on the topic of two 'Women's Days' in Armenia resulted in the recognition of the so-called 'Women's Month' which is the period between March 8 and April 7.

In Italy, to celebrate the day, men give [[Acacia dealbata|yellow mimosas]] to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/societa/otto/otto/otto.html |title=la Repubblica/societa: 8 marzo, niente manifestazione tante feste diverse per le donne |publisher=Repubblica.it |date= |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2006/c/sezioni/politica/versoelezioni34/ciampidonne/ciampidonne.html |title=politica " Festa della donna, parla Ciampi "La parità è ancora lontana" |publisher=Repubblica.it |date=March 8, 2006 |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Teresa Mattei]] chose the mimosa as the symbol of IWD in Italy because she felt that the French symbols of the day, [[Violet (plant)|violets]] and [[lily-of-the-valley]], were too scarce and expensive to be used effectively in Italy.&lt;ref name=florentine&gt;{{cite news|first=Dierdre|last=Pirro|title=Teresa Mattei, Flower power |url=http://www.theflorentine.net/articles/article-view.asp?issuetocId=5425 |work=[[The Florentine]] |publisher= |date=March 25, 2013 |accessdate=April 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yellow mimosas and chocolate are also one of the most common March 8 presents in Russia and Albania.

In many countries, such as in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Croatia, Colombia, Estonia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine the custom of giving women flowers still prevails [within these regions only]. Women also sometimes get gifts from their employers. Schoolchildren often bring gifts for their female teachers, too.

In countries like Portugal and Italy groups of women usually celebrate on the night of March 8 in "women-only" dinners and parties.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

In Pakistan working women in formal and informal sectors celebrate International Women's Day every year to commemorate their ongoing struggle for due rights, despite facing many cultural and religious restrictions. Some women working for change in society use IWM to help the movement for women's rights. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} In Poland, for instance, every IWD includes large feminist demonstrations in major cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ippf.org/en/News/Intl+news/March+8+in+Poland+Still+Marching+Together+for+Freedom+and+Equality.htm |title=March 8 in Poland: Still Marching Together for Freedom and Equality |publisher=Ippf.org |date= |accessdate=March 8, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407024131/http://www.ippf.org/en/News/Intl+news/March+8+in+Poland+Still+Marching+Together+for+Freedom+and+Equality.htm |archivedate=April 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, which was designated as International Women's Year, the United Nations gave official sanction to, and began sponsoring, International Women's Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comoserguapa.com/feliz-dia-la-mujer/ |title=Formalization of International Women's Day |publisher=Comoserguapa.com |date= |accessdate=March 8, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312212313/http://comoserguapa.com/feliz-dia-la-mujer/ |archivedate=March 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for efforts to achieve official recognition in the [[United States of America]], actress and human rights activist [[Beata Pozniak]] worked with the Mayor of Los Angeles and the Governor of California to lobby members of the U.S. Congress to propose official recognition of the holiday. In February 1994, H.J. Res. 316 was introduced by Rep. [[Maxine Waters]], along with 79 cosponsors, in an attempt to officially recognize March 8 of that year as International Women's Day. The bill was subsequently referred to, and remained in, the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. No vote of either house of Congress was achieved on this piece of legislation.&lt;ref name="billsummary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d103:h.j.res.00316: |title=Bill Summary &amp; Status 103rd Congress (1993–1994) H.J.RES.316 |publisher=Library of Congress |date= |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 Congress (conference) of the British [[Trades Union Congress]] overwhelmingly approved a resolution calling for IWD to be designated a public holiday in the United Kingdom.

Since 2005, IWD has been celebrated in [[Montevideo]], either on the principal street, 18 de Julio, or alternatively through one of its neighbourhoods. The event has attracted much publicity due to a group of female drummers, La Melaza, who have performed each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uruguaynow.com/la_melaza_candombe.php |title=Travel Guide to Uruguay – Uruguay gets a female beat |publisher=UruguayNow |date= |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The internationalwomensday.com digital hub allows registration for IWD events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=internationalwomensday.com|title=About|url=http://www.internationalwomensday.com/About}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The IWD website adopts an annual theme that is globally relevant for groups and organizations and has the further objective that women and the media can learn about local activity.

In Taiwan, International Women's Day is marked by the annual release of a government survey on women's waist sizes, accompanied by warnings that weight gain can pose a hazard to women's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2013/03/09/2003556662 |title=Women's waistlines increasing: bureau |publisher=Taipei Times |date=March 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish Women's Convention (SWD) celebrates IWD on the Saturday nearest to 8 March. Over the past 10 years, women from throughout Scotland have met in the Scottish Parliament in a celebratory event organised by the SWC.

In the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]], huge Soviet-style celebrations were held annually. After the fall of Communism, the holiday, generally considered to be one of the major symbols of the old regime, fell into obscurity. International Women's Day was re-established as an official "important day" by the [[Parliament of the Czech Republic]] in 2004&lt;ref name="Kapusta‐Pofahl"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/aeer/article/viewFile/1284/1356 |title=Reinstating International Women's Day in the Czech Republic: Feminism, Politics and the Specter of Communism |author= Karen Kapusta‐Pofahl |publisher=Washburn University |access-date= February 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the proposal of the [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] and [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia|Communists]]. This has provoked some controversy as a large part of the public as well as the political right see the holiday as a relic of the nation's Communist past.&lt;ref name="Kapusta‐Pofahl" /&gt; In 2008, the Christian conservative [[Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party|Czechoslovak People's Party]]'s deputies unsuccessfully proposed the abolition of the holiday. However, some non-government organizations consider the official recognition of International Women's Day as an important reminder of women's role in the society.

International Women's Day sparked violence in [[Tehran]], Iran on March 4, 2007, when police beat hundreds of men and women who were planning a rally. (A previous rally for the occasion was held in Tehran in 2003.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4555610/international_womens_day_rally_in/ "Iranian Women Rally to Demand Equal Social, Political Rights"] ''Index-Journal'' (March 9, 2003): 9. via [[Newspapers.com]]{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police arrested dozens of women and some were released after several days of solitary confinement and interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harrison |first=Frances |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6426087.stm |title=Middle East &amp;#124; Iranian women struggle for equality |publisher=BBC News |date=March 8, 2007 |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shadi Sadr]], [[Mahbubeh Abbasgholizadeh]] and several more community activists were released on March 19, 2007, ending a fifteen-day hunger strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/03/07/iran15452.htm |title=Iran: Release Women's Rights Advocates &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=March 8, 2007 |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Apocrypha ==

A popular [[apocrypha]]l story which surfaced in French Communist circles&lt;ref name="emancipatie.nl"&gt;Temma Kaplan, On the Socialist Origins of International Women's Day, in: Feminist Studies, 11, 1985, S. 163–171. ([http://www.emancipatie.nl/_documenten/vvnl/doc/2006/KaplanSocialistOrigins.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Françoise Picq 1982"&gt;Liliane Kandel / Françoise Picq, [http://www.archivesdufeminisme.fr/article.php3?id_article=80 "Le Mythe des origines à propos de la journée internationale des femmes"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927183523/http://www.archivesdufeminisme.fr/article.php3?id_article=80 |date=September 27, 2013 }}, in: La Revue d'en face, 12, 1982, S. 67–80.&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that women from clothing and textile factories had staged a protest on March 8, 1857 in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Howard Zophy, Handbook of American women's history, Garland, 1991, 187.&lt;/ref&gt; The story alleged that garment workers were protesting against very poor working conditions and low wages and were attacked and dispersed by police. It was claimed that this event led to a rally in commemoration of its 50th anniversary in 1907. Temma Kaplan&lt;ref name="emancipatie.nl" /&gt; explains that "neither event seems to have taken place, but many Europeans think March 8, 1907, inaugurated International Women's Day."&lt;ref name="emancipatie.nl" /&gt; Speculating about the origins of this 1857 legend, Liliane Kandel and Françoise Picq suggested it was likely that (in recent times) some felt it opportune to detach International Women's Day from its basis in Soviet history and ascribe to it a more "international" origin which could be painted as more ancient than Bolshevism and more spontaneous than a decision of Congress or the initiative of those women affiliated to the Party.&lt;ref name="Françoise Picq 1982" /&gt;
