'''International Women's Day''' ('''IWD''') is celebrated on March 8 every year.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/feature/iwd/history.html | title=UN WomenWatch: International Women's Day –  | publisher=UN.org | accessdate=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- LINK PARTIALLY BROKEN: UN put up a redirection with JavaScript, avoidable with "stop loading" button in browsers --&gt; It is a focal point in the movement for [[women's rights]].

After the [[Socialist Party of America]] organised a Women's Day on February 28, 1909 in [[New York (city)|New York]], the [[International Socialist Women's Conferences|1910 International Socialist Woman's Conference]] suggested a Women's Day be held annually. After women gained suffrage in [[Soviet Russia]] in 1917, March 8 became a national [[holiday]] there. The day was then predominantly celebrated by the socialist movement and communist countries until it was adopted in 1975 by the [[United Nations]].

Today, International Women's Day is a public holiday in some countries and largely ignored elsewhere.&lt;ref name=RFE100 /&gt; In some places, it is a day of protest; in others, it is a day that celebrates womanhood.

In August 1910, an [[International Socialist Women's Conferences#Copenhagen 1910|International Socialist Women's Conference]] was organized to precede the general meeting of the Socialist [[Second International]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name="ruthchild 2012"&gt;Rochelle Goldberg Ruthchild, "From West to East: International Women’s Day, the First Decade”, ''Aspasia: The International Yearbook of Central, Eastern, and Southeastern European Women's and Gender History'', vol. 6 (2012): 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired in part by the American socialists, German Socialist [[Luise Zietz]] proposed the establishment of an annual Women's Day and was seconded by fellow socialist and later communist leader [[Clara Zetkin]], supported by [[Käte Duncker]], although no date was specified at that conference.&lt;ref name="kaplan"&gt;Temma Kaplan, "On the Socialist Origins of International Women's Day", Feminist Studies, 11/1 (Spring, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= History of International Women's Day |url= https://www.un.org/womenwatch/feature/iwd/history.html |publisher= United Nations |accessdate= May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delegates (100 women from 17 countries) agreed with the idea as a strategy to promote equal rights including [[suffrage]] for women.&lt;ref name="iwd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalwomensday.com/About|title=About International Women's Day |publisher=Internationalwomensday.com |date=March 8, 1917 |accessdate=February 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year on March 19, 1911, IWD was marked for the first time, by over a million people in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland.&lt;ref name="unevents" /&gt; In the Austro-Hungarian Empire alone, there were 300 demonstrations.&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt; In Vienna, women paraded on the [[Ringstrasse]] and carried banners honouring the martyrs of the [[Paris Commune]].&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt; Women demanded that they be given the [[right to vote]] and to hold public office.

In 1913 [[Russian Empire|Russian]] women observed their first International Women's Day on the last Saturday in February (by the [[Julian calendar]] then used in Russia).&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt;

In 1914 International Women's Day was held on March 8 in Germany, possibly because that day was a Sunday, and now it is always held on March 8 in all countries.&lt;ref name="mmf1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mmf2010.info/our-action/le-8-mars-2013-journee-internationale-des-femmes-a-la-recherche-de-la-memoire-perdue |title=8th of March – International woman's day: in search of lost memory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313064904/http://www.mmf2010.info/our-action/le-8-mars-2013-journee-internationale-des-femmes-a-la-recherche-de-la-memoire-perdue |archivedate=March 13, 2011|deadurl=yes |accessdate=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1914 observance of the Day in Germany was dedicated to women's right to vote, which German women did not win until 1918.&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/suffrage.htm |title=Women's Suffrage |publisher=Inter-Parliamentary Union |accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In London there was a march from Bow to [[Trafalgar Square]] in support of women's suffrage on March 8, 1914. [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] was arrested in front of [[Charing Cross]] station on her way to speak in Trafalgar Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suffragist Disorders|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/archive/article/1914-03-09/5/1.html#start%3D1785-01-01%26end%3D1985-12-31%26terms%3D%22Sylvia%20Pankhurst%22%20arrested%26back%3D/tto/archive/find/%252522Sylvia+Pankhurst%252522+arrested/w:1785-01-01%7E1985-12-31/o:date/4%26prev%3D/tto/archive/frame/goto/%252522Sylvia+Pankhurst%252522+arrested/w:1785-01-01%7E1985-12-31/o:date/32%26next%3D/tto/archive/frame/goto/%252522Sylvia+Pankhurst%252522+arrested/w:1785-01-01%7E1985-12-31/o:date/34|accessdate=May 9, 2014|newspaper=The Times|date=March 9, 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 8, 1917, on the [[Gregorian calendar]], in the capital of the [[Russian Empire]], [[Petrograd]], women textile workers began a demonstration, covering the whole city. This marked the beginning of the [[February Revolution]], which alongside the [[October Revolution]] made up the [[Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ria.ru/revolution_postup/20170306/1489217048.html|title=February Revolution|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt; Women in Saint Petersburg went on strike that day for "Bread and Peace"&amp;nbsp;– demanding the end of World War I, an end to Russian food shortages, and the end of czarism.&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt; [[Leon Trotsky]] wrote, "23 February (8th March) was International Woman's Day and meetings and actions were foreseen. But we did not imagine that this 'Women's Day' would inaugurate the revolution. Revolutionary actions were foreseen but without date. But in the morning, despite the orders to the contrary, textile workers left their work in several factories and sent delegates to ask for support of the strike… which led to mass strike... all went out into the streets."&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt; Seven days later, the [[Emperor of Russia]], [[Nicholas II]] abdicated and the [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional Government]] granted women the right to vote.&lt;ref name="unevents" /&gt;

Following the [[October Revolution]], the [[Bolshevik]] [[Alexandra Kollontai]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]] made it an [[Public holiday|official holiday]] in the Soviet Union, but it was a working day until 1965. On May 8, 1965 by the decree of the [[USSR]] [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] International Women's Day was declared a non-working day in the USSR "in commemoration of the outstanding merits of Soviet women in communistic construction, in the defense of their Fatherland during the Great Patriotic War, in their heroism and selflessness at the front and in the rear, and also marking the great contribution of women to strengthening friendship between peoples, and the struggle for peace. But still, women's day must be celebrated as are other holidays."

From its official adoption in Soviet Russia following the Revolution in 1917, the holiday was predominantly celebrated in communist countries and by the communist movement worldwide. It was celebrated by the communists in China from 1922.&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt; After the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949 the State Council proclaimed on December 23 that March 8 would be made an official holiday with women in China given a half-day off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anniversaries of important events|url=http://www.gov.cn/english/2005-08/10/content_28291.htm|website=China Factfile|publisher=Chinese Government|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communist leader [[Dolores Ibárruri]] led a women's march in Madrid in 1936 on the eve of the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt;

The [[United Nations]] began celebrating International Women's Day in the [[International Women's Year]], 1975. In 1977, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] invited member states to proclaim March 8 as the [[UN Day]] for [[women's rights]] and [[world peace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/international-womens-day|title=International Women's Day |publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egypt, however, the day was a step back for women. In Egypt's [[Tahrir Square]], hundreds of men came out not in support, but to harass the women who came out to stand up for their rights as the police and military stood by watching the events unfold in front of them, doing nothing to stop the crowds of men.

On the occasion of International Women's Day 2012, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] called for more action to help the mothers and wives of people who have gone missing during armed conflict. The vast majority of people who go missing in connection with conflict are men. As well as the anguish of not knowing what has happened to the missing husband or son, many of these women face economic and practical difficulties. The ICRC underlined the duty of parties to a conflict to search for the missing and provide information to the families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/news-release/2012/women-day-news-2012.htm Helping women take matters into their own hands] International Committee of the Red Cross&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme for International Women's Day 2017 was "Women in the Changing World of Work: Planet 50-50 by 2030".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/international-womens-day/|title=International Women's Day 2017|publisher=UN Women|accessdate=8 March 2017|language=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308061547/http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/international-womens-day|archivedate=March 8, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a message in support of International Women's Day, the UN Secretary-General [[António Guterres]] commented on how [[women's rights]] were being "reduced, restricted and reversed". With men still in leadership positions and a widening economic [[Gender pay gap|gender gap]], he called for change "by empowering women at all levels, enabling their voices to be heard and giving them control over their own lives and over the future of our world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2017/3/statement-sg-international-womens-day-2017|title=UN Secretary-General's Message for International Women's Day|date=6 March 2017|publisher=UN|accessdate=8 March 2017 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On this day it is customary for men to give the women in their lives&amp;nbsp;– friends, mothers, wives, girlfriends, daughters, colleagues, etc.&amp;nbsp;– flowers and small gifts. In some countries (such as Bulgaria and Romania) it is also observed as an equivalent of Mother's Day, where children also give small presents to their mothers and grandmothers.&lt;ref name="agentia.org" /&gt; In Russia, the day has lost all political context through the time, becoming simply a day to honor women and feminine beauty.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Гуриев, Сергей Маратович|Сергей Гуриев]]''.

In the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]], huge Soviet-style celebrations were held annually. After the fall of Communism, the holiday, generally considered to be one of the major symbols of the old regime, fell into obscurity. International Women's Day was re-established as an official "important day" by the [[Parliament of the Czech Republic]] in 2004&lt;ref name="Kapusta‐Pofahl"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/aeer/article/viewFile/1284/1356 |title=Reinstating International Women's Day in the Czech Republic: Feminism, Politics and the Specter of Communism |author= Karen Kapusta‐Pofahl |publisher=Washburn University |access-date= February 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the proposal of the [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] and [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia|Communists]]. This has provoked some controversy as a large part of the public as well as the political right see the holiday as a relic of the nation's Communist past.&lt;ref name="Kapusta‐Pofahl" /&gt;

International Women's Day sparked violence in [[Tehran]], Iran on March 4, 2007, when police beat hundreds of men and women who were planning a rally. (A previous rally for the occasion was held in Tehran in 2003.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4555610/international_womens_day_rally_in/ "Iranian Women Rally to Demand Equal Social, Political Rights"] ''Index-Journal'' (March 9, 2003): 9. via [[Newspapers.com]]{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police arrested dozens of women and some were released after several days of solitary confinement and interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harrison |first=Frances |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6426087.stm |title=Middle East &amp;#124; Iranian women struggle for equality |publisher=BBC News |date=March 8, 2007 |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shadi Sadr]], [[Mahbubeh Abbasgholizadeh]] and several more community activists were released on March 19, 2007, ending a fifteen-day hunger strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/03/07/iran15452.htm |title=Iran: Release Women's Rights Advocates &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=March 8, 2007 |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mimosa2007.JPG|150px|thumb|left|[[Acacia dealbata|Yellow mimosa]] is the symbol of IWD in Italy]]
In Italy, to celebrate the day, men give [[Acacia dealbata|yellow mimosas]] to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/societa/otto/otto/otto.html |title=la Repubblica/societa: 8 marzo, niente manifestazione tante feste diverse per le donne |publisher=Repubblica.it |date= |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2006/c/sezioni/politica/versoelezioni34/ciampidonne/ciampidonne.html |title=politica " Festa della donna, parla Ciampi "La parità è ancora lontana" |publisher=Repubblica.it |date=March 8, 2006 |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communist politician [[Teresa Mattei]] chose the mimosa in 1946 as the symbol of IWD in Italy because she felt that the French symbols of the day, [[Violet (plant)|violets]] and [[lily-of-the-valley]], were too scarce and expensive to be used effectively in Italy.&lt;ref name=florentine&gt;{{cite news|first=Dierdre|last=Pirro|title=Teresa Mattei, Flower power |url=http://www.theflorentine.net/articles/article-view.asp?issuetocId=5425 |work=[[The Florentine]] |publisher= |date=March 25, 2013 |accessdate=April 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, actress and human rights activist [[Beata Pozniak]] worked with the Mayor of Los Angeles and the Governor of California to lobby members of the U.S. Congress to propose official recognition of the holiday. In February 1994, H. J. Res. 316 was introduced by Rep. [[Maxine Waters]], along with 79 cosponsors, in an attempt to officially recognize March 8 of that year as International Women's Day. The bill was subsequently referred to, and remained in, the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. No vote of either house of Congress was achieved on this piece of legislation.&lt;ref name="billsummary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d103:h.j.res.00316: |title=Bill Summary &amp; Status 103rd Congress (1993–1994) H.J.RES.316 |publisher=Library of Congress |date= |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
