'''International Women's Day''' ('''IWD''') is marked on '''[[March 8]]''' every year. It is a major day of global celebration for the economic, political and social achievements of women. 

Started as a political event, the holiday blended in the culture of many countries (primarily [[Russia]] and the countries of former Soviet bloc). &lt;br&gt; In some celebrations, the day lost its political flavour, and became simply an occasion for men to express their love to the women around them in a somewhat similar to [[Mother's Day]] and [[St Valentine's Day]] mixed together. In others, however, the political and human rights theme as designated by the [[United Nations]] runs strong, and political and social awareness of the struggles of women worldwide are brought out and examined in a hopeful manner.

The IWD is also celebrated as the first spring holiday, as in the listed countries the first day of March is considered the first day of the spring season.

==History==
[[Image:8marchrallydhaka (55).JPG|thumb|March 8 rally in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]]]]
The first IWD was observed on [[28 February]] [[1909]] in the United States following a declaration by the [[Socialist Party of America]]. Among other relevant historic events, it commemorates the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] ([[New York]], [[1911]]), where over 140 women lost their lives. The idea of having an international women's day was first put forward at the turn of the [[20th century]] amid rapid world [[industrialization]] and economic expansion that led to protests over working conditions. By urban legend,&lt;ref&gt;Temma Kaplan, On the Socialist Origins of International Women's Day, in: Feminist Studies, 11, 1985, S. 163-171. ([http://www.emancipatie.nl/_documenten/vvnl/doc/2006/KaplanSocialistOrigins.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liliane Kandel / Françoise Picq, Le Mythe des origines à propos de la journée internationale des femmes, in: La Revue d'en face, 12, 1982, S. 67-80.&lt;/ref&gt; women from [[clothing]] and [[textile]] factories staged one such protest on [[8 March]] [[1857]] in [[New York, New York|New York City]]{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. The garment workers were protesting what they saw as very poor working conditions and low wages. The protesters were attacked and dispersed by [[police]]. These women established their first [[labor union]] in the same month two years later.
 
More protests followed on 8 March in subsequent years, most notably in [[1908]] when 15,000 women marched through New York City demanding shorter hours, better pay and voting rights{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. In [[1910]] the first international women's conference was held in [[Copenhagen]] (in the labour-movement building located at Jagtvej 69, which until recently housed [[Ungdomshuset]]) by the [[Second International]] and an 'International Women's Day' was established, which was submitted by the important German Socialist [[Clara Zetkin]]. The following year, IWD was marked by over a million people in [[Austria]], [[Denmark]], [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]]. However, soon thereafter, the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] in [[New York City]] killed over 140 garment workers. A lack of safety measures was blamed for the high death toll. Furthermore, on the eve of [[World War I]], women across [[Europe]] held peace rallies on [[8 March]] [[1913]]. In the West, International Women's Day was commemorated during the [[1910s]] and [[1920s]], but dwindled. It was revived by the rise of [[feminism]] in the [[1960s]]. 
 
Demonstrations marking International Women's Day in [[Russia]] proved to be the first stage of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].

Following the [[October Revolution]], the [[Bolshevik]] feminist [[Alexandra Kollontai]] persuaded [[Lenin]] to make it an [[holiday|official holiday]] in Russia, and it was established, but was a working day until 1965. On [[May 8]] [[1965]] by the decree of the USSR [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] International Women's Day was declared as a non working day in the [[USSR]] "in commemoration of outstanding merits of the Soviet women in communistic construction, in the defense of their Motherland during the [[Great Patriotic War]], their heroism and selflessness at the front and in rear, and also marking the big contribution of women to strengthening friendship between peoples and struggle for the peace."

== Women's Day in modern culture ==
[[Image:8marta.jpg|thumb|250px|The 1932 Soviet poster dedicated to the 8th of March holiday. The text reads: "8th of March is the day of the rebellion of the working women against the kitchen slavery" and "Down with the oppression and narrow-mindedness of the household work!". Originally in the USSR the holiday had a clear political character, emphasizing the role of the Soviet state in ''liberation of women'' from the second-class citizens' position...]]
[[Image:8march landysh.jpg|thumb|250px|However, with time the meaning of the Holiday evolved to an apolitical celebration of women with an emphasis on their beauty and motherhood. Most late Soviet 8th of March postcards carried no political meaning.]]
The day remains an official holiday in [[Albania]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belarus]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[China]], [[Cuba]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Moldova]], [[Mongolia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Ukraine]], [[Uzbekistan]],  and [[Vietnam]], and is observed by men giving the women in their lives - mothers, wives, girlfriends, colleagues, etc., flowers and small gifts. In some countries it is also observed as an equivalent of Mother's Day, where children also give small presents to their mothers and grandmothers.  

After the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] celebrations of IWD were abandoned in Armenia. Instead [[April 7]] was introduced as state holiday of ‘Beauty and Motherhood.’ The new holiday immediately got popular among [[Armenians]], as it commemorates one of the main holidays of [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Church]], [[Annunciation]]. However, people still kept celebrating IWD on March 8 as well. Public discussion held on the topic of two ‘Women’s Days’ in Armenia resulted in the recognition of the so called ‘Women’s Month’ which is the period between March 8 and April 7.       

In [[Italy]], to celebrate the day, men give [[Acacia dealbata|yellow mimosas]] to women.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.repubblica.it/online/societa/otto/otto/otto.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.repubblica.it/2006/c/sezioni/politica/versoelezioni34/ciampidonne/ciampidonne.html&lt;/ref&gt; Yellow mimosas and chocolate are also one of the most common March 8 presents in Russia.

In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Brazil]], [[Croatia]], [[Hungary]], [[Montenegro]], [[Poland]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], the custom of giving women flowers still prevails. Women usually get gifts from their employers too.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} School children often bring gifts for their teachers as well.

In [[India]], IWD holds a lot of significance. Many celebrations are held during the day. This portrays the power of women in the modern era and how vital their role is in the society.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}
 
In [[1975]], which had been designated as [[International Women’s Year]], the [[United Nations]] gave official sanction to and began sponsoring International Women's Day.
 
The [[2005]] Congress (conference) of the British [[Trades Union Congress]] overwhelmingly approved a resolution calling for IWD to be designated a public holiday in the United Kingdom.
 
Today many events are held by women's groups around the world. The global women's organization [[Aurora (organization)|Aurora]] hosts a free worldwide register of IWD local events ([http://www.internationalwomensday.com www.internationalwomensday.com]) so that women and the media can locate local activity. Many governments and organisations around the world support IWD. For example, [[HSBC]] hosts a range of IWD activity including co-hosting of the [[United Kingdom|UK]]'s flagship IWD event with women's group Aurora. Global interest in IWD shows a steady increase.
