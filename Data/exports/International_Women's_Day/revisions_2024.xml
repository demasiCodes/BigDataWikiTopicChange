'''International Women's Day''' ('''IWD''') is a [[holiday]] celebrated annually on March 8 as a focal point in the [[women's rights|women's rights movement]].

The earliest version reported was a "[[National Woman's Day|Woman's Day]]" organized by the [[Socialist Party of America]] in [[New York City]] on February 28, 1909. This inspired German delegates at the [[International Socialist Women's Conferences|1910 International Socialist Women's Conference]] in [[Copenhagen]] to propose "a special Women's Day" be organized annually, albeit with no set date;&lt;ref name="ICSW"&gt;{{Cite web|title="International Socialist Congress, 1910; Second International Conference of Socialist Women|url=https://archive.org/details/InternationalSocialistCongress1910SecondInternationalConferenceOf/page/n21/mode/2up|page=21|access-date=March 7, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; the following year saw the first demonstrations and commemorations of International Women's Day across Europe.

In August 1910, an [[International Socialist Women's Conferences#Copenhagen 1910|International Socialist Women's Conference]] was organized ahead of the general meeting of the Socialist [[Second International]] in Copenhagen, Denmark.&lt;ref name="ruthchild 2012"&gt;Rochelle Goldberg Ruthchild, "From West to East: International Women's Day, the First Decade", ''Aspasia: The International Yearbook of Central, Eastern, and Southeastern European Women's and Gender History'', vol. 6 (2012): 1–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired in part by the American socialists, German delegates [[Clara Zetkin]], [[Käte Duncker]], [[Paula Thiede]], and others proposed the establishment of an annual "Women's Day", although no date was specified.&lt;ref name="ICSW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kaplan"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Temma |last=Kaplan |title=On the Socialist Origins of International Women's Day |journal=Feminist Studies |volume=11 |issue=1 |year=1985 |pages=163–171 |jstor=3180144|doi=10.2307/3180144 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= History of International Women's Day |url= https://www.un.org/womenwatch/feature/iwd/history.html |publisher= United Nations |access-date= May 26, 2012 |archive-date= July 3, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190703185713/https://www.un.org/womenwatch/feature/iwd/history.html |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 100 delegates, representing 17 countries, agreed with the idea as a strategy to promote equal rights, including [[suffrage|women's suffrage]].&lt;ref name="iwd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalwomensday.com/About |title=About International Women's Day |publisher=Internationalwomensday.com |date=March 8, 1917 |access-date=February 26, 2016 |archive-date=September 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190916195847/https://www.internationalwomensday.com/About |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, on March 19, 1911, the first International Women's Day was marked by over a million people in Austria-Hungary, Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland.&lt;ref name="unevents" /&gt; In Austria-Hungary alone, there were 300 demonstrations,&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt; with women parading on the [[Ringstrasse]] in Vienna, carrying banners honoring the martyrs of the [[Paris Commune]].&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt; Across Europe, women demanded the [[right to vote]] and to hold public office, and protested against employment sex discrimination.&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt;

IWD initially had no set date, though it was generally celebrated in late February or early March. Americans continued to observe "[[National Woman's Day|Woman's Day]]" on the last Sunday in February, while Russia observed International Women's Day for the first time in 1913, on the last Saturday in February (albeit based on the [[Julian calendar]], as in the Gregorian calendar, the date was March 8).&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt; In 1914, International Women's Day was held on March 8 for the first time in Germany, possibly because that date was a Sunday.&lt;ref name="mmf1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mmf2010.info/our-action/le-8-mars-2013-journee-internationale-des-femmes-a-la-recherche-de-la-memoire-perdue |title=8th of March – International woman's day: in search of lost memory |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313064904/http://www.mmf2010.info/our-action/le-8-mars-2013-journee-internationale-des-femmes-a-la-recherche-de-la-memoire-perdue |archive-date=March 13, 2011|url-status=dead |access-date=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As elsewhere, Germany's observance was dedicated to women's right to vote, which German women did not win until 1918.&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/suffrage.htm |title=Women's Suffrage |publisher=Inter-Parliamentary Union |access-date=January 26, 2014 |archive-date=August 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807104506/http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/suffrage.htm |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, there was a march in London in support of women's suffrage, during which [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] was arrested in front of [[Charing Cross]] station on her way to speak in [[Trafalgar Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suffragist Disorders|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/archive/article/1914-03-09/5/1.html#start%3D1785-01-01%26end%3D1985-12-31%26terms%3D%22Sylvia%20Pankhurst%22%20arrested%26back%3D/tto/archive/find/%252522Sylvia+Pankhurst%252522+arrested/w:1785-01-01%7E1985-12-31/o:date/4%26prev%3D/tto/archive/frame/goto/%252522Sylvia+Pankhurst%252522+arrested/w:1785-01-01%7E1985-12-31/o:date/32%26next%3D/tto/archive/frame/goto/%252522Sylvia+Pankhurst%252522+arrested/w:1785-01-01%7E1985-12-31/o:date/34|access-date=May 9, 2014|newspaper=The Times|date=March 9, 1914|archive-date=March 2, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220302155147/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/archive/article/1914-03-09/5/1.html#start%3D1785-01-01%26end%3D1985-12-31%26terms%3D%22Sylvia%20Pankhurst%22%20arrested%26back%3D/tto/archive/find/%252522Sylvia+Pankhurst%252522+arrested/w:1785-01-01%7E1985-12-31/o:date/4%26prev%3D/tto/archive/frame/goto/%252522Sylvia+Pankhurst%252522+arrested/w:1785-01-01%7E1985-12-31/o:date/32%26next%3D/tto/archive/frame/goto/%252522Sylvia+Pankhurst%252522+arrested/w:1785-01-01%7E1985-12-31/o:date/34|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 8, 1917, in [[Petrograd]] (February 23, 1917, on the [[Julian calendar]]), women textile workers began a demonstration that eventually engulfed the whole city, demanding "Bread and Peace"—an end to World War I, to food shortages, and to [[Tsarist autocracy|Tsarism]].&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt; This marked the beginning of the [[February Revolution]], which alongside the [[October Revolution]], made up the [[Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ria.ru/revolution_postup/20170306/1489217048.html|title=February Revolution|date=March 6, 2017|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|access-date=March 7, 2017|archive-date=March 2, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220302154812/https://ria.ru/20170306/1489217048.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revolutionary leader [[Leon Trotsky]] wrote, "23 February (8th March) was International Woman's Day and meetings and actions were foreseen. But we did not imagine that this 'Women's Day' would inaugurate the revolution. Revolutionary actions were foreseen but without a date. But in the morning, despite the orders to the contrary, textile workers left their work in several factories and sent delegates to ask for the support of the strike… which led to mass strike... all went out into the streets."&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt; Seven days later, Tsar [[Nicholas II]] abdicated, and the [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional Government]] granted women the right to vote.&lt;ref name="unevents" /&gt;

After the Russian Revolution, [[Bolshevik]]s began to celebrate the International Women's Day on 8 March as it marked the beginning of revolutionary changes in 1917 in Russia. However, it was not officially declared as such for some time. For example, the first congress of the newly founded Communist International could only adopt a very brief "Resolution on the Role of Working Women" submitted by [[Alexandra Kollontai]] on 6 March 1919, which made no mention of 8 March or IWD. The second congress convened next year couldn't even find time for it, although it began holding an "International Conference of Communist Women" (organized by a newly created "International Secretariat on Work Amongst Women") under its auspices. It was only during the third world congress of Communist International in 1921 that an important document titled "Methods and Forms of Work Among Communist Party Women: Theses" was adopted as a result of the work of the Second International Conference of Communist Women held in parallel to this congress. The theses mentioned "organizing an annual International Working Women's Day" among the tasks of central women's department of communist parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theses, Resolutions and Manifestos of the First Four Congresses of the Third International |editor=Alan Adler |translator=Alix Holt, Barbara Holland |publisher=Ink Links |year=1980 |pages=46, 177, 210–229, 325–26 |isbn=0-906133-12-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its adoption in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], IWD was predominantly celebrated in communist countries and by the communist movement worldwide. In the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]], huge Soviet-style celebrations were held annually.&lt;ref name="Kapusta‐Pofahl"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/aeer/article/viewFile/1284/1356 |title=Reinstating International Women's Day in the Czech Republic: Feminism, Politics and the Specter of Communism |author=Karen Kapusta-Pofahl |publisher=Washburn University |access-date=February 28, 2016 |archive-date=March 5, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305030020/https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/aeer/article/viewFile/1284/1356 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Chinese communists observed the holiday beginning in 1922,&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt; though it soon gained traction across the [[political spectrum]]. In 1927, [[Guangzhou]] saw a march of 25,000 women and male supporters, including representatives of the [[Kuomintang]], the [[YWCA]], and labor organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yau Tsit Law|title=International Women's Day in Canton March 8, 1927|journal=News Bulletin (Institute of Pacific Relations)|date=June–July 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]] on October 1, 1949, the State Council proclaimed on December 23 that March 8 would be made an official holiday, with women given a half-day off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anniversaries of important events|url=http://www.gov.cn/english/2005-08/10/content_28291.htm|website=China Factfile|publisher=Chinese Government|access-date=August 28, 2011|archive-date=September 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190913161251/http://www.gov.cn/english/2005-08/10/content_28291.htm|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hujum]] ({{lang-rus|Худжум|Khudzhum|xʊd͡ʐʐʊm}}; in [[Turkic languages]], ''storming'' or ''assault'', from {{langx|ar|هجوم}}) was a series of policies and actions taken by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], initiated by [[Joseph Stalin]] on International Women's Day in 1927, to remove all manifestations of [[gender inequality]], especially the systems of female [[veil]]ing and seclusion practiced in [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Northrop, Douglas (2001a).

The Sydney march featured approximately sixty women leading three hundred to five hundred marchers. The Melbourne march consisted of fifty women leading one hundred and fifty marchers, with a banner in front stating, "Long Live International Women's Day". In 1938, the first major International Women’s Day meeting in Perth was held; in attendance were women from the Association of University Women, Jewish Women, [[Mothers Union]], [[Movement Against War and Fascism]], [[National Council of Women of Australia|National Council of Women]], Spanish Relief Committee, [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]], [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]], Women's Section of [[National Party of Australia – Queensland|Primary Producers]], [[Women's Service Guilds]], Young Labor League, and [[YWCA]].&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

The [[Congress of American Women]] was an American [[women's rights]] organization founded in New York on International Women's Day in 1946, following the 1945 founding conference of the [[Women's International Democratic Federation]] in Paris, to which it affiliated. Its primary organizer was [[Elinor S. Gimbel]] (wife of Louis S. Gimbel, Jr., grandson of [[Adam Gimbel]] of [[Gimbels]] department store.&lt;ref&gt;

The organization was finally dissolved in 1950. The congress was an official US branch of the [[Women's International Democratic Federation]], which though an antifascist organization was pro-Soviet.&lt;ref name=":congress0"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gore |first=Dayo F. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-3YVCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59 |title=Radicalism at the Crossroads: African American Women Activists in the Cold War |publisher=[[NYU Press]] |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-8147-7011-5 |location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization supported progressive policies giving women full rights and equality both in the home and economically.

IWD remained predominantly a communist holiday until circa 1967 when it was taken up by [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave feminists]].&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt; The day re-emerged as a day of activism, and is sometimes known in Europe as the "Women's International Day of Struggle". In the 1970s and 1980s, women's groups were joined by leftists and labor organizations in calling for equal pay, equal economic opportunity, equal legal rights, [[reproductive rights]], subsidized child care, and the prevention of violence against women.&lt;ref name="Søland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://origins.osu.edu/connecting-history/international-womens-day|title=International Women's Day|first=Birgitte|last=Søland|publisher=Origins|date=March 4, 2019|access-date=March 10, 2019|archive-date=March 2, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220302155203/https://origins.osu.edu/connecting-history/international-womens-day|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wbur.org/news/2017/01/20/boston-womens-march-history|title=Ahead Of The Boston Women's March, A Look Back 47 Years Ago|first=Elizabeth|last=Gillis|publisher=WBUR|date=January 20, 2017|access-date=July 22, 2019|archive-date=March 2, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220302155146/https://www.wbur.org/news/2017/01/20/boston-womens-march-history|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International Women's Day had been largely forgotten in the United States by the late 1960s, before an activist called [[Laura X]] organized a march in Berkeley, California, on International Women’s Day in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Bernikow |first=Louise |date=2005-03-02 |title=The Birth of Women's History Month |url=https://womensenews.org/2005/03/the-birth-womens-history-month/ |access-date=2023-03-01 |website=Women's eNews |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The march led to the creation of The Women’s History Research Center, a central archive of the women’s movement from 1968 to 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=1970: Reviving the fighting spirit of Int'l Women's Day |url=https://www.workers.org/2005/us/womens-day-0303/ |access-date=2023-03-01 |website=www.workers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laura X also thought it unfair for half the human race, meaning women, to have only one day a year and called for National [[Women's History Month]] to be built around International Women’s Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Anniversary of Women's History Library/NCMDR |url=https://ncmdr.org/anniv.html |access-date=2023-03-01 |website=ncmdr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Women’s History Research Center collected nearly one million documents on microfilm, and provided resources and records of the women’s liberation movement that are now available through the National Women’s History Alliance, which carried on their ideas, including successfully petitioning Congress to declare March as Women’s History Month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Women's History in the Digital World 2015 – Ken Wachsberger's Blog |url=https://kenwachsberger.wordpress.com/tag/womens-history-in-the-digital-world-2015/ |access-date=2023-03-01 |website=Ken Wachsberger's Blog |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, 1972 was when large IWD marches began.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Announced in 1978 on International Women’s Day, the [[Women’s Work Committee]] in Palestine came to represent an association willing to develop a strategy to combine national liberation and women's liberation. The founders of the committee were disappointed in the actions of previous charitable societies as they failed to educate the general population; to rectify this issue, they launched programs promoting literacy, health education, and classes teaching embroidery. Further aiding those of a working-class background, they started daycare centers to allow them to continue working as their children were being cared for.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Hiltermann, Joost R. “The Women’s Movement during the Uprising.” ''Journal of Palestine Studies'' 20, no. 3 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[1979 International Women's Day protests in Tehran|International Women's Day in 1979]], a women's march took place in [[Tehran]] in [[Iran]]. The march was originally intended to celebrate International Women's Day, but transformed into massive protests against the changes taking place in women's rights during the [[Iranian revolution]], specifically the introduction of mandatory [[hijab]] (veiling), which had been announced the day before. The protests lasted for six days, from 8 March to 14 March 1979, with thousands of women participating. The protests resulted in a temporary retraction of the decree of mandatory veiling. When the left and the liberals were eliminated, and the conservatives secured sole control, however, veiling was enforced on all women.&lt;ref name="Iran"&gt;John Foran, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2Z2FAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=1979+iran+hijab+protest&amp;pg=PA144 Theorizing Revolutions]''&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 8, 1984 in Argentina, the first International Women's Day demonstrations since the end of the country's military regime took place in the [[Congressional Plaza]], in what is now considered a landmark.&lt;ref name="revistafurias"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revistafurias.com/8-de-marzo-de-1984/|language=es|title=8 de marzo de 1984|last=Bellucci|first=Mabel|publisher=Revista Furias|access-date=March 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was organized by the Multisectorial de la Mujer (English: Multisectorial of Women), an organization formed by members of women's groups, feminists, housewives and representatives of political parties and unions.&lt;ref name="revistafurias"/&gt; An emblematic moment of the protests was when activist [[María Elena Oddone]] climbed up the stairs of the Monument of the Two Congresses and raised a banner that read "No to motherhood, yes to pleasure". Her banner, as well as those held by other [[radical feminist]]s that day, was harshly criticized by the press for being too provocative. Oddone was also repudiated within the feminist movement. Elena Tchalidy, president of the [[Alicia Moreau de Justo]] Foundation, said: "March 8 was the first public act and she walked with [that sign]. It came out in the magazine that today would be ''Caras'' or ''Gente''. Then she said to me: 'Oh, three girls came to me.' 'Yes', I told her, 'and you distanced a few thousand.'&lt;ref name="revistafurias"/&gt; Oddone recalled the meeting with the Multisectorial de la Mujer that took place two days after the event in her autobiography, claiming she replied to their "lapidary critics": "I am not a feminist to please anyone but to tell the truth about our condition. I did not write those banners to be liked. If they caused scandal, it is because the truth is always scandalous. We received Dr. Justo with admiration and affection. Eighty years ago, she and her companions who asked for the right to vote were called 'crazy'. I am willing to wait the same number of years for my banners to be understood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oddone|first=María Elena|page=34|language=es|title=La pasión por la libertad: Memorias de una feminista|year=2001|publisher=Colihue-Mimbipa|isbn=978-9992582374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] began celebrating International Women's Day in 1975, which had been proclaimed the [[International Women's Year]]. In 1977, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] invited member states to ''"proclaim in accordance with their historical and national traditions and customs, any day of the year as United Nations Day for Women's Rights and International Peace"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{UN doc |docid=A-RES-32-142 |body=A |session=32 |type=R |resolution_number=142 |title=Women's participation in the strengthening of international peace and security and in the struggle against colonialism, racism, racial discrimination, foreign aggression and occupation and all forms of foreign domination |date=16 December 1977 |accessdate=10 March 2024}} {{Dead link|date=March 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/32/142 |title=UN Resolution A/RES/32/142 |publisher=United Nations General Assembly |access-date=10 March 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; In common with most countries, March 8 has been traditionally recognised as the day for International Women's Days by the UN for [[women's rights]] and [[world peace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/international-womens-day|title=International Women's Day|publisher=United Nations|access-date=February 13, 2014|archive-date=May 12, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210512134039/https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/international-womens-day|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been commemorated annually by the UN and much of the world, with each year's observance centered on a particular theme or issue within women's rights.

Regardless of [[legal]] status, in much of the [[world]], it is customary for women and men to give their female [[colleagues]] and loved ones flowers and gifts on the day. In some [[Country|countries]] (such as [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]]) it is also observed as an equivalent of [[Mother's Day]], where children also give small presents to their [[mother]]s and [[Grandparent|grandmothers]].&lt;ref name="agentia.org" /&gt;

In the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]], huge Soviet-style celebrations were held annually. After the fall of Communism, the holiday, generally considered to be one of the major symbols of the old regime, fell into obscurity. International Women's Day was re-established as an official "important day" by the [[Parliament of the Czech Republic]] in 2004&lt;ref name="Kapusta‐Pofahl"/&gt; on the proposal of the [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] and [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia|Communists]]. This has provoked some controversy as a large part of the public as well as the political right see the holiday as a relic of the nation's Communist past.&lt;ref name="Kapusta‐Pofahl" /&gt;
