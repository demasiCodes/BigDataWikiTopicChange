'''International Women's Day''' ('''IWD''') is a global [[holiday]] [[list of minor secular observances#March|celebrated]] annually on March 8 as a focal point in the [[women's rights|women's rights movement]], bringing attention to issues such as [[gender equality]], [[reproductive rights]], and [[Violence against women|violence and abuse against women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=About International Women's Day|url=https://www.internationalwomensday.com/about|access-date=March 8, 2021|website=International Women's Day|language=en|archive-date=June 3, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603171245/https://www.internationalwomensday.com/About|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{Cite web|title=International Women's Day|url=https://www.un.org/en/observances/womens-day|access-date=March 8, 2021|website=United Nations|language=en|archive-date=March 7, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210307203632/https://www.un.org/en/observances/womens-day|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spurred on by the [[Women's suffrage|universal female suffrage]] movement, IWD originated from [[labour movement|labor movements]] in North America and Europe during the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=History of International Women's Day|url=https://www.internationalwomensday.com/Activity/15586/The-history-of-IWD|access-date=March 8, 2021|website=International Women's Day|language=en|archive-date=March 7, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210307202122/https://www.internationalwomensday.com/Activity/15586/The-history-of-IWD|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nations"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Nations|first=United|title=Background {{!}} International Women's Day|url=https://www.un.org/en/observances/womens-day/background|access-date=March 8, 2021|website=United Nations|language=en|archive-date=March 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200308132802/https://www.un.org/en/observances/womens-day/background|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Stories of women's activism|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/suffrage125/three-waves-of-womens-activism|access-date=February 18, 2022|website=nzhistory.govt.nz|language=en|archive-date=February 18, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220218003206/https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/suffrage125/three-waves-of-womens-activism|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest version reported was a "[[National Woman's Day|Women's Day]]" organized by the [[Socialist Party of America]] in [[New York City]] on February 28, 1909. This inspired German delegates at the [[International Socialist Women's Conferences|1910 International Socialist Women's Conference]] to propose "a special Women's Day" be organized annually, albeit with no set date;&lt;ref name="ICSW"&gt;{{Cite web|title="International Socialist Congress, 1910; Second International Conference of Socialist Women|url=https://archive.org/details/InternationalSocialistCongress1910SecondInternationalConferenceOf/page/n21/mode/2up|page=21|access-date=March 7, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; the following year saw the first demonstrations and commemorations of International Women's Day across Europe. After women gained suffrage during the [[Russian Provisional Government]] in 1917, IWD was made a national [[holiday]] on March 8;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Pruitt |first=Sarah |date=2023-09-13 |title=The Surprising History of International Women's Day |url=https://www.history.com/news/the-surprising-history-of-international-womens-day |access-date=2023-11-02 |website=[[History (American TV network)|HISTORY]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was subsequently celebrated on that date by the [[socialist movement]] and [[communist countries]]. The holiday was associated with far-left movements and governments until its adoption by the [[Feminist movement|global feminist movement]] in the late 1960s. IWD became a mainstream global holiday following its adoption by the [[United Nations]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/observances/womens-day/background|title=International Women's Day, 8 March|website=United Nations|language=en|access-date=March 7, 2020|archive-date=March 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200308132802/http://www.un.org/en/observances/womens-day/background|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International Women's Day is commemorated in a variety of ways worldwide; it is a public holiday in several countries, and observed socially or locally in others to celebrate and promote the achievements of women.&lt;ref name=RFE100 /&gt;

The UN observes the holiday in connection with a particular issue, campaign, or theme in women's rights.&lt;ref name="Nations"/&gt; In some parts of the world, IWD still reflects its political origins, being marked by protests and calls for radical change; in other areas, particularly in the West, it is largely sociocultural and centered on a celebration of womanhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nationaltoday.com/international-womens-day/|title=International Women's Day – March 8, 2020|website=National Today|language=en-US|access-date=March 6, 2020|archive-date=March 9, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220309065134/https://nationaltoday.com/international-womens-day/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1910, an [[International Socialist Women's Conferences#Copenhagen 1910|International Socialist Women's Conference]] was organized ahead of the general meeting of the Socialist [[Second International]] in Copenhagen, Denmark.&lt;ref name="ruthchild 2012"&gt;Rochelle Goldberg Ruthchild, "From West to East: International Women's Day, the First Decade", ''Aspasia: The International Yearbook of Central, Eastern, and Southeastern European Women's and Gender History'', vol. 6 (2012): 1–24.&lt;/ref&gt; However, what made history for the modern celebration of International Women's Day, according to the [[ILO]], was the fire at the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire|Triangle Shirtwaist factory]] in New York City on March 25, 1911, which killed 146 young workers, most of whom were immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Triangle Shirtwaist Fire and International Women's Day: 100 years on |date=March 8, 2011 |url=https://www-ilo-org.translate.goog/global/about-the-ilo/mission-and-objectives/features/WCMS_152708/lang--en/index.htm?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp |access-date=March 7, 2023 |archive-date=March 6, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230306165613/https://www-ilo-org.translate.goog/global/about-the-ilo/mission-and-objectives/features/WCMS_152708/lang--en/index.htm?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired in part by the American socialists, German delegates [[Clara Zetkin]], [[Käte Duncker]], [[Paula Thiede]], and others proposed the establishment of an annual "Women's Day", although no date was specified.&lt;ref name="ICSW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kaplan"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Temma |last=Kaplan |title=On the Socialist Origins of International Women's Day |journal=Feminist Studies |volume=11 |issue=1 |year=1985 |pages=163–171 |jstor=3180144|doi=10.2307/3180144 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= History of International Women's Day |url= https://www.un.org/womenwatch/feature/iwd/history.html |publisher= United Nations |access-date= May 26, 2012 |archive-date= July 3, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190703185713/https://www.un.org/womenwatch/feature/iwd/history.html |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 100 delegates, representing 17 countries, agreed with the idea as a strategy to promote equal rights, including [[suffrage|women's suffrage]].&lt;ref name="iwd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalwomensday.com/About |title=About International Women's Day |publisher=Internationalwomensday.com |date=March 8, 1917 |access-date=February 26, 2016 |archive-date=September 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190916195847/https://www.internationalwomensday.com/About |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, on March 19, 1911, the first International Women's Day was marked by over a million people in Austria, Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland.&lt;ref name="unevents" /&gt; In Austria-Hungary alone, there were 300 demonstrations,&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt; with women parading on the [[Ringstrasse]] in Vienna, carrying banners honoring the martyrs of the [[Paris Commune]].&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt; Across Europe, women demanded the [[right to vote]] and to hold public office, and protested against employment sex discrimination.&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt;

IWD initially had no set date, though it was generally celebrated in late February or early March. Americans continued to observe "National Women's Day" on the last Sunday in February, while Russia observed International Women's Day for the first time in 1913, on the last Saturday in February (albeit based on the [[Julian calendar]], as in the Gregorian calendar, the date was March 8).&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt; In 1914, International Women's Day was held on March 8 for the first time in Germany, possibly because that date was a Sunday.&lt;ref name="mmf1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mmf2010.info/our-action/le-8-mars-2013-journee-internationale-des-femmes-a-la-recherche-de-la-memoire-perdue |title=8th of March – International woman's day: in search of lost memory |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313064904/http://www.mmf2010.info/our-action/le-8-mars-2013-journee-internationale-des-femmes-a-la-recherche-de-la-memoire-perdue |archive-date=March 13, 2011|url-status=dead |access-date=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As elsewhere, Germany's observance was dedicated to women's right to vote, which German women did not win until 1918.&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/suffrage.htm |title=Women's Suffrage |publisher=Inter-Parliamentary Union |access-date=January 26, 2014 |archive-date=August 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807104506/http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/suffrage.htm |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, there was a march in London in support of women's suffrage, during which [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] was arrested in front of [[Charing Cross]] station on her way to speak in [[Trafalgar Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suffragist Disorders|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/archive/article/1914-03-09/5/1.html#start%3D1785-01-01%26end%3D1985-12-31%26terms%3D%22Sylvia%20Pankhurst%22%20arrested%26back%3D/tto/archive/find/%252522Sylvia+Pankhurst%252522+arrested/w:1785-01-01%7E1985-12-31/o:date/4%26prev%3D/tto/archive/frame/goto/%252522Sylvia+Pankhurst%252522+arrested/w:1785-01-01%7E1985-12-31/o:date/32%26next%3D/tto/archive/frame/goto/%252522Sylvia+Pankhurst%252522+arrested/w:1785-01-01%7E1985-12-31/o:date/34|access-date=May 9, 2014|newspaper=The Times|date=March 9, 1914|archive-date=March 2, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220302155147/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/archive/article/1914-03-09/5/1.html#start%3D1785-01-01%26end%3D1985-12-31%26terms%3D%22Sylvia%20Pankhurst%22%20arrested%26back%3D/tto/archive/find/%252522Sylvia+Pankhurst%252522+arrested/w:1785-01-01%7E1985-12-31/o:date/4%26prev%3D/tto/archive/frame/goto/%252522Sylvia+Pankhurst%252522+arrested/w:1785-01-01%7E1985-12-31/o:date/32%26next%3D/tto/archive/frame/goto/%252522Sylvia+Pankhurst%252522+arrested/w:1785-01-01%7E1985-12-31/o:date/34|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 8, 1917, in [[Petrograd]] (February 23, 1917, on the [[Julian calendar]]), women textile workers began a demonstration that eventually engulfed the whole city, demanding "Bread and Peace"—an end to World War I, to food shortages, and to [[Tsarist autocracy|czarism]].&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt;  This marked the beginning of the [[February Revolution]], which alongside the [[October Revolution]], made up the second [[Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ria.ru/revolution_postup/20170306/1489217048.html|title=February Revolution|date=March 6, 2017|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|access-date=March 7, 2017|archive-date=March 2, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220302154812/https://ria.ru/20170306/1489217048.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revolutionary leader [[Leon Trotsky]] wrote, "23 February (8th March) was International Woman's Day and meetings and actions were foreseen. But we did not imagine that this 'Women's Day' would inaugurate the revolution. Revolutionary actions were foreseen but without a date. But in the morning, despite the orders to the contrary, textile workers left their work in several factories and sent delegates to ask for the support of the strike… which led to mass strike... all went out into the streets."&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt; Seven days later, Tsar [[Nicholas II]] abdicated, and the [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional Government]] granted women the right to vote.&lt;ref name="unevents" /&gt;

In 1917, [[Bolshevik]]s [[Alexandra Kollontai]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]] made IWD an [[Public holiday|official holiday]] in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title=How Lenin and Russian Revolution in 1917 played a role in the origin of Women's Day|url=https://www.dailyo.in/variety/womens-day-russian-revolution-october-revolution-womens-rights-russia-suffrage/story/1/22725.html|access-date=March 7, 2021|website=www.dailyo.in|archive-date=March 31, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331133717/https://www.dailyo.in/variety/womens-day-russian-revolution-october-revolution-womens-rights-russia-suffrage/story/1/22725.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 8, 1965, the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] decreed International Women's Day a non-working day in the USSR, "in commemoration of the outstanding merits of Soviet women in communistic construction, in the defense of their Fatherland during the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]], in their heroism and selflessness at the front and in the rear, and also marking the great contribution of women to strengthening friendship between peoples, and the struggle for peace. But still, women's day must be celebrated as are other holidays."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

After its official adoption in Soviet Russia, IWD was predominantly celebrated in communist countries and by the communist movement worldwide. Communist leader [[Dolores Ibárruri]] led a women's march in Madrid in 1936 on the eve of the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt; Chinese communists observed the holiday beginning in 1922,&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt; though it soon gained traction across the [[political spectrum]]: In 1927, [[Guangzhou]] saw a march of 25,000 women and male supporters, including representatives of the [[Kuomintang]], the [[YWCA]], and labor organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yau Tsit Law|title=International Women's Day in Canton March 8, 1927|journal=News Bulletin (Institute of Pacific Relations)|date=June–July 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, the State Council proclaimed on December 23 that March 8 would be made an official holiday, with women given a half-day off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anniversaries of important events|url=http://www.gov.cn/english/2005-08/10/content_28291.htm|website=China Factfile|publisher=Chinese Government|access-date=August 28, 2011|archive-date=September 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190913161251/http://www.gov.cn/english/2005-08/10/content_28291.htm|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption by United Nations===

IWD remained predominantly a communist holiday until roughly 1967 when it was taken up by [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave feminists]].&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt; The day re-emerged as a day of activism, and is sometimes known in Europe as the "Women's International Day of Struggle".

In 1977, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] invited member states to proclaim March 8 as [[UN Day|an official UN holiday]] for [[women's rights]] and [[world peace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/international-womens-day|title=International Women's Day|publisher=United Nations|access-date=February 13, 2014|archive-date=May 12, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210512134039/https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/international-womens-day|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been commemorated annually by the UN and much of the world, with each year's observance centered on a particular theme or issue within women's rights.

Regardless of legal status, in much of the world, it is customary for men and women to give their colleagues and loved ones flowers and gifts and show the equality towards the other gender. In some countries (such as Bulgaria and Romania) it is also observed as an equivalent of Mother's Day, where children also give small presents to their mothers and grandmothers.&lt;ref name="agentia.org" /&gt; In the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]], huge Soviet-style celebrations were held annually.
