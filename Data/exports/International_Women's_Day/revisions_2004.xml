It is a major day of global celebration for the economic, political and social achievements of women. Amongst other relevant historic events, it commemorates the [[Triangle Factory Fire]] ([[New York]], [[1911]]), where over 140 women lost their lives. 

The idea of having an international women's day was first put forward at the turn of the [[20th century]] amid rapid world [[industrialization]] and economic expansion that led to protests over working conditions. Women from [[clothing]] and [[textile]] factories staged one such protest on [[March 8]]th, [[1857]] in [[New York, New York|New York City]]. The garment workers were protesting what they saw as very poor working conditions and low wages. The protesters were attacked and dispersed by [[police]]. These women established their first [[labour union]] in the same month two years later.

More protests followed on March 8th in subsequent years, most notably in [[1908]] when 15,000 women marched through [[New York City]] demanding shorter hours, better pay and voting rights. Even so, the first IWD was observed on [[28 February]] [[1909]] in the United States following a declaration by the [[Socialist Party of America]]. In [[1910]] the first international women's conference was held in [[Copenhagen]] by the [[Socialist International]] and an 'International Women's Day' was established. The following year, IWD was marked by over a million people in [[Austria]], [[Denmark]], [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]]. However, just six days later, the [[Triangle Factory Fire]] in [[New York City]] killed over 140 garment workers. A lack of safety measures was blamed for the high death toll. Furthermore, on the eve of [[World War One]], women across [[Europe]] held peace rallies on [[March 8]], [[1913]].

Demonstrations marking International Women's Day in [[Russia]] proved to be the first stage of the [[Russian Revolution]]. Following the [[October Revolution]], the [[Bolshevik]] feminist [[Alexandra Kollontai]] persuaded [[Lenin]] to make it an [[official holiday]], and during the Soviet period it continued to celebrate "the heroic woman worker". The day remains an official [[holiday]] in Russia, and is observed by men congratulating women (''any'' woman) and giving them gifts.

In the West, International Women's Day was commemorated during the [[1910s]] and [[1920s]], but dwindled. It was revived by the rise of [[feminism]] in the [[1960s]]. In [[1975]], the [[United Nations]] began sponsoring International Women's Day.
