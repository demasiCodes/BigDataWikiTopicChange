It is a major day of global celebration for the economic, political and social achievements of women. Among other relevant historic events, it commemorates the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] ([[New York]], [[1911]]), where over 140 women lost their lives. 

The idea of having an international women's day was first put forward at the turn of the [[20th century]] amid rapid world [[industrialization]] and economic expansion that led to protests over working conditions. Women from [[clothing]] and [[textile]] factories staged one such protest on [[8 March]] [[1857]] in [[New York, New York|New York City]]. The garment workers were protesting what they saw as very poor working conditions and low wages. The protesters were attacked and dispersed by [[police]]. These women established their first [[labor union]] in the same month two years later.

More protests followed on 8 March in subsequent years, most notably in [[1908]] when 15,000 women marched through New York City demanding shorter hours, better pay and voting rights. Even so, the first IWD was observed on [[28 February]] [[1909]] in the United States following a declaration by the [[Socialist Party of America]]. In [[1910]] the first international women's conference was held in [[Copenhagen]] by the [[Socialist International]] and an 'International Women's Day' was established. The following year, IWD was marked by over a million people in [[Austria]], [[Denmark]], [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]]. However, soon thereafter, the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] in [[New York City]] killed over 140 garment workers. A lack of safety measures was blamed for the high death toll. Furthermore, on the eve of [[World War I]], women across [[Europe]] held peace rallies on [[8 March]] [[1913]].

Demonstrations marking International Women's Day in [[Russia]] proved to be the first stage of the [[Russian Revolution]]. Following the [[October Revolution]], the [[Bolshevik]] feminist [[Alexandra Kollontai]] persuaded [[Lenin]] to make it an [[holiday|official holiday]], and during the Soviet period it continued to celebrate "the heroic woman worker". However, the holiday quickly lost its political flavour and became an occasion for men to express their sympathy or love to the women around them - somewhat similar to Western [[Mother's Day]] and [[St Valentine's Day]] mixed together. The day remains an official holiday in [[Russia]] (as well as in [[Belarus]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Moldova]], and [[Ukraine]]), and is observed by men congratulating women (''any'' woman) and giving them flowers and gifts. When [[Czechoslovakia]] was part of the Soviet Block this celebration was supported officially and gradually turned into parody - see [[MDZ (International Women's Day in Czechoslovakia, 1948 - 1989)|MD&amp;#381;]].

In the West, International Women's Day was commemorated during the [[1910s]] and [[1920s]], but dwindled. It was revived by the rise of [[feminism]] in the [[1960s]]. In [[1975]], the [[United Nations]] began sponsoring International Women's Day.
