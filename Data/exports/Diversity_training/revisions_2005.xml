Although it is a big business with a profound effect on business, government and education, observers characterize diversity training in very different ways. Its proponents consider it morally right, because it [[respect diversity|respects diversity]]. They also view it as economically sound, because it enables organizations to draw on multiplicities of talents and strengths. Its opponents consider it an oppressive [[ideology|ideological]] re-education tactic, that actually injures the ability of organizations to attain their goals.
