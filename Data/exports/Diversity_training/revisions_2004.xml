Nonetheless, views on it vary so much that it is difficult to characterize. Typically, its stated purpose is to treat [[diversity]] as an opportunity and promote the ability of students and workers from a great variety of backgrounds to cooperate productively and make as great a contribution as possible to organizational goals. 

Its proponents consider it morally right, because it [[respect diversity|respects diversity]]; they also view it as economically sound, because it enables organizations to draw on multiplicities of talents and strengths. Its opponents consider it an oppressive [[ideology|ideological]] monstrosity, a sort of [[mind control]] or short-term [[reeducation camp]], that actually injures the ability of organizations to attain their goals.
