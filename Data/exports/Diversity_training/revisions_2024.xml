{{Discrimination sidebar|state=collapsed}}'''Diversity training''' is a type of [[Training and development|corporate training]] designed to facilitate positive intergroup interaction, reduce [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]], and teach different individuals how to work together effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Lindsey |first1=Alex |last2=King |first2=Eden |last3=Hebl |first3=Michelle |last4=Levine |first4=Noah |date=September 2015|title=The Impact of Method, Motivation, and Empathy on Diversity Training Effectiveness|journal=[[Journal of Business and Psychology]]|volume=30|issue=3|pages=605–617|doi=10.1007/s10869-014-9384-3|s2cid=144447133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diversity training is often aimed to meet objectives such as attracting and [[Customer retention|retaining customers]] and productive workers; maintaining high [[employee morale]]; and fostering understanding and harmony between workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chavez | first1 = Carolyn I. | last2 = Weisinger | first2 = Judith Y. | title = Beyond diversity training: a social infusion for cultural inclusion | journal = Human Resource Management| volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 331&amp;ndash;350 | doi = 10.1002/hrm.20215 | date = Summer 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite intended benefits, systematic studies have not proven benefits to diversity training. While some studies show that voluntary diversity training can lead to more diverse management, other studies have found that mandatory diversity training can lead to increased discrimination and prejudice.

As of 2019, more than $8 billion a year is spent on diversity training in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/despite-spending-billions-companies-cant-buy-diversity/2019/11/21/d8907b92-fb1a-11e9-ac8c-8eced29ca6ef_story.html |first=Stephanie |last=Mehta |date=2019-11-21 |title=Despite spending billions, companies can't buy diversity |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |url-status=live |archive-date=2021-12-04 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20211204014841/https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/despite-spending-billions-companies-cant-buy-diversity/2019/11/21/d8907b92-fb1a-11e9-ac8c-8eced29ca6ef_story.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== 1960s ===
In the 1960s, the concept of promoting diversity in the workplace was prompted as a result of the [[civil rights movement]]. The [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], enacted by the [[88th United States Congress|88th US Congress]], made it illegal for employers with more than 15 workers to discriminate against employees and candidates based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, age, and disability was also later outlawed. After the Act was passed, activists protested organizations who refused to hire blacks, planned jobs banks,{{Clarify|date=December 2021}} and filed charges against employers that discriminated against employees.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Anand|first1=Rohini|last2=Winters|first2=Mary-Frances|date=2008|title=A Retrospective View of Corporate Diversity Training From 1964 to the Present|url=https://ideas.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Anand-Winters-2008.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211129141531/https://ideas.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Anand-Winters-2008.pdf|archive-date=2021-11-29|journal=Academy of Management Learning &amp; Education|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=356–372|doi=10.5465/amle.2008.34251673|issn=1537-260X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1970s ===
The [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] extended the definition of discrimination in 1971 in [[Griggs v. Duke Power Co.|Griggs v. Duke Power Company]], ruling against employment practices that ostracized black employees without evidence of intent to discriminate. The civil rights movement helped to recreate its momentum for a new round of movements in the 1970s for the rights of women, the disabled, Latinos, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dobbin|first=Frank|url=https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9781400830893/html|title=Inventing Equal Opportunity|date=2009-12-31|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-3089-3|location=Princeton|doi=10.1515/9781400830893}}&lt;/ref&gt; With shifts in societal and legal reforms, federal agencies took the first step towards modern day diversity training, and by the end of 1971, the [[Social Security Administration]] had enrolled over 50,000 employees through racial bias training. Corporations followed suit and, over the next five years, began offering anti-bias training to their employees. By 1976, 60 percent of large companies offered equal-opportunity training.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Dobbin|first1=Frank|last2=Kalev|first2=Alexandra|date=2018-05-04|title=Why Doesn't Diversity Training Work?

=== 1980s to Present ===
In the 1980s, [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]] tried to reverse [[affirmative action]] regulations put forward by former president [[John F. Kennedy]] and appointed [[Clarence Thomas]] to run the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]. As a result, diversity trainers in the U.S. began calling for diversity training, arguing that women and minorities would soon be the backbone of the workforce and that companies needed to determine how to include them amongst their ranks. By 2005, 65 percent of large corporations offered their employees some form of diversity training.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; 

Promoting respect and appealing to minority employees and customers became significant goals of diversity training starting in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="readnymag" /&gt; In the early 2000s, an expansion of diversity training was prompted by a series of high-profile discrimination lawsuits in the financial industry.&lt;ref name="dobbinsfail" /&gt; 

== Impact ==
Findings on diversity trainings are mixed. According to Harvard University sociologist Frank Dobbin, there is no evidence to indicate that anti-bias training leads to increases in the number of women or people of color in management positions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Bergner |first=Daniel |date=2020-07-15 |title='White Fragility' Is Everywhere.

According to a 2006 study in the ''[[American Sociological Review]]'', "diversity training and diversity evaluations are least effective at increasing the share of white women, black women, and black men in management."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kalev|first1=Alexandra|last2=Dobbin|first2=Frank|last3=Kelly|first3=Erin|date=August 2006|title=Best practices or best guesses?

Alexandra Kalev and Frank Dobbin conducted a comprehensive review of cultural diversity training conducted in 830 midsize to large U.S. workplaces over a thirty one-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Vedantam|first=Shankar|date=2008-01-20|title=Most Diversity Training Ineffective, Study Finds|language=en-US|journal=The Washington Post and Times-Herald|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/19/AR2008011901899.html|access-date=2018-04-29|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results showed that diversity training was followed by a decrease of anywhere from 7.5–10% in the number of women in management. The percentage of black men in top positions fell by 12 percent. Similar effects were shown for Latinos and Asians. The study did not find that all diversity training is ineffective. Mandatory training programs offered to protect against discrimination lawsuits were called into question. Voluntary diversity training participation to advance organization's business goals was associated with increased diversity at the management level; voluntary services resulted in near triple digit increases for black, Hispanic, and Asian men.&lt;ref name="dobbinsfail"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Dobbins|first1=Frank|last2=Kalev|first2=Alexandra|date=July 2016|title=Why Diversity Programs Fail|url=https://hbr.org/2016/07/why-diversity-programs-fail|url-status=live|journal=Harvard Business Review|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821071539/https://hbr.org/2016/07/why-diversity-programs-fail |archive-date=2016-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2021 [[meta-analysis]] found a lack of high quality studies on the efficacy of diversity training.&lt;ref name="Paluck 2020"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Paluck |first1=Elizabeth Levy |last2=Porat |first2=Roni |last3=Clark |first3=Chelsey S. |last4=Green |first4=Donald P. |date=2021-01-04 |title=Prejudice Reduction: Progress and Challenges |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |volume=72 |issue=1 |pages=533–560 |doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-071620-030619 |pmid=32928061 |s2cid=221722150 |issn=0066-4308|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers concluded that "while the small number of experimental studies provide encouraging average effects... the effects shrink when the trainings are conducted in real-world workplace settings, when the outcomes are measured at a greater time distance than immediately following the intervention, and, most importantly, when the sample size is large enough to produce reliable results."&lt;ref name="Paluck 2020" /&gt;

A 2013 study found that white men were less likely to think a complaint of discrimination by an employee was accurate when they were told that the employer used diversity training, even when they were presented with evidence of discrimination.&lt;ref name=presumedfair/&gt; Several studies of the results of discrimination lawsuits in the United States have found that official diversity structures, including diversity training, have increasingly been accepted by judges as evidence of a lack of discrimination regardless of their effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=When Organizations Rule: Judicial Deference to Institutionalized Employment Structures |journal=American Journal of Sociology |issue=117 #3 |date=November 2011 |first1=Lauren B. |last1=Edelman |first2=Linda H. |last2=Krieger |first3=Scott R. |last3=Eliason |first4=Catherine R. |last4=Albiston |first5=Virginia |last5=Mellema |volume=117 |pages=888–954 |doi=10.1086/661984 |s2cid=31192421 |url=https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1124680/files/organizations_rule.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211217015734/https://tind-customer-berkeleylaw.s3.amazonaws.com/50c616f6-cc62-4f74-91b8-b557eaed5f8c?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B+filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27organizations_rule.pdf&amp;response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAXL7W7Q3XNDXVUP4O%2F20211217%2Feu-west-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Date=20211217T015250Z&amp;X-Amz-Signature=18eec7fd6a1d3626a52bbe826c456fdfaa62433860a2893b2a33095e52b8bad7 &lt;!--The original URL redirected here when archived--&gt; |archive-date=2021-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=When "Best Practices" Win, Employees Lose: Symbolic Compliance and Judicial Inference in Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Cases |journal=[[Law &amp; Social Inquiry]] |first1=Linda Hamilton |last1=Krieger |first2=Rachel Kahn |last2=Best |first3=Lauren B. |last3=Edelman |date=2015 |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=843–879 |doi=10.1111/lsi.12116 |s2cid=153033615 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273158676 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211217015639/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Linda-Krieger-2/publication/273158676_When_Best_Practices_Win_Employees_Lose_Symbolic_Compliance_and_Judicial_Inference_in_Federal_Equal_Employment_Opportunity_Cases/links/5c339bd492851c22a36264c8/When-Best-Practices-Win-Employees-Lose-Symbolic-Compliance-and-Judicial-Inference-in-Federal-Equal-Employment-Opportunity-Cases.pdf |archive-date=2021-12-17 |hdl=10125/66112 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nakamura&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Brent K. |last1=Nakamura |first2=Lauren B. |last2=Edelman |title=''Bakke'' at 40: How Diversity Matters in the Employment Context |issue=52 |date=2019 |journal=UC Davis Law Review |pages=2627–2679 |url=https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/52/5/Symposium/52-5_Nakamura_Edelman.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211217020116/https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/52/5/Symposium/52-5_Nakamura_Edelman.pdf |archive-date=2021-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nakamura &amp; Edelman's summary of corporate diversity policies, "[i]n the twenty-first century, diversity commitments and policies are standard and firms that lack such structures look suspect."&lt;ref name=nakamura/&gt;
