Trainers use diversity training as a means to meet many objectives, such as attracting and retaining [[customers]] and productive workers; maintaining high [[employee]] morale; and/or fostering understanding and harmony between workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chavez | first1 = Carolyn I. | last2 = Weisinger | first2 = Judith Y. | title = Beyond diversity training: a social infusion for cultural inclusion | journal = Human Resource Management, special issue: Part One: Breaking Barriers for Purposes of Inclusiveness | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 331&amp;ndash;350 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1002/hrm.20215 | date = Summer 2008 | url = https://doi.org/10.1002/hrm.20215 | ref = harv | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a systematic analysis has shown the diversity training is usually counterproductive.&lt;ref name="ethics.harvard.edu"&gt;{{Cite web | last1 = Dobbin | first1 = Frank | last2 = Kalev | first2 = Alexandra | url = http://ethics.harvard.edu/blog/why-diversity-management-backfires-and-how-firms-can-make-it-work|title=Why Diversity Management Backfires (And How Firms Can Make it Work)|website=ethics.harvard.edu | publisher = [[Edmond J.

==Controversial issues==
Diversity training has been a controversial issue, raising questions about moral considerations and counter-productivity. Observers characterize diversity training in very different ways. Its proponents consider it morally right, because it respects diversity, recognizing the value and contributions of every human being. They also view it as economically sound, because it enables organizations to draw on multiplicities of talents and strengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Diversity at the Top May Boost the Bottom Line | url = http://www.utdallas.edu/news/2010/9/10-5431_Diversity-at-the-Top-May-Boost-the-Bottom-Line_article.html#sharer | work = UT Dallas News | publisher = [[University of Texas at Dallas|UT Dallas]] | date = 10 September 2010 | access-date = 13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hans Bader, its opponents consider it an oppressive [[ideology]] and reeducation tactic that actually reduces the ability of organizations to attain their goals. It has been suggested that diversity training reinforces differences between individuals instead of fostering their commonalities, thus helping to further racialize the workplace, creating situations where people "tiptoe" around issues such as how to relate to people of different cultures as opposed to people learning to [[communicate]] with and truly understand each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Bader | first = Hans | url = https://cei.org/blog/diversity-training-backfires | title = Diversity training backfires | publisher = [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] | website = cei.org| date = 26 December 2007 | access-date = 13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs which established specific responsibility for diversity, such as [[equal opportunity]] staff positions or diversity task forces, have proven most effective in general. However, the results also indicate that [[White people|White]] females benefit significantly more from diversity training. The benefits for [[African American]] females and males were appreciably lower than European American females. [[Social network|Networking]] and [[mentor]]ing, which were considered bias mitigating approaches, served [[African Americans|African American]] females the most. African American males were the least likely to benefit from any of the methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kalev | first1 = Alexandra | last2 = Dobbin | first2 = Frank | last3 = Kelly | first3 = Erin | title = Best practices or best guesses?

They argue that attempting to see both sides of a controversial issue builds empathy and allows working environments to function better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steiner | first1 = Sue | last2 = Brzuzy | first2 = Stephanie | last3 = Gerdes | first3 = Karen | last4 = Hurdle | first4 = Donna | title = Using structured controversy to teach diversity content and cultural competence | journal = Journal of Teaching in Social Work | volume = 23 | issue = 1&amp;ndash;2 | pages = 55&amp;ndash;71 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1300/J067v23n01_05 | date = 2003 |url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J067v23n01_05 | ref = harv | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purported benefits ==
An analysis of data from over 800 firms over 30 years shows that diversity training and grievance procedures backfires and leads to reductions in the diversity of the firms workforce.&lt;ref name="ethics.harvard.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; Other research shows that people "were less likely to take discrimination complaints seriously against companies who had diversity programs".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = McElroy | first = Molly | url = http://www.washington.edu/news/2013/04/03/diversity-programs-give-illusion-of-corporate-fairness-study-shows/ | title = Diversity programs give illusion of corporate fairness, study shows | work = UW Today | publisher = [[University of Washington]] | date = 3 April 2013 |access-date=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As organizations and communities are becoming more [[Globalization|globalized]], there is a need for an expansion in relation to communication among individuals from all over the world, operating within a diverse environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/240550|title=The Myriad Benefits of Diversity in the Workplace|last=Abreu|first=Kim|work=[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]]|access-date= 13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars believe it is beneficial for companies to train a diverse staff, as a reflection of the market in which you wish to serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Armache | first = Jalal | title = Diversity in the workplace: benefits and challenges | journal = Journal of International Diversity | volume = 2012 | issue = 1 | pages = 59&amp;ndash;75 | publisher = | date = March 2012 | url = http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/75172682/diversity-workplace-benefits-challenges | ref = harv | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jalai Armache, in a heterogeneous workplace environment filled with people knowledgeable of those with different backgrounds and nationalities, there is ability to easily expand an organization.  There is an ability to create inventive solutions to issues being faced in the world market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Kim Abreu, there are five key benefits of diversity in today's workplace. One of these benefits is increased creativity, which bases from the belief that teams including workers from different experiences and backgrounds are able to produce creative solutions to problem solving.  Additionally, benefits of workplace diversity also include drives in innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last1 = Hewlett | first1 = Sylvia Ann | last2 = Marshall | first2 = Melinda | last3 = Sherbin | first3 = Laura | url = https://hbr.org/2013/12/how-diversity-can-drive-innovation/ar/1 | title=How Diversity Can Drive Innovation | work = [[Harvard Business Review]] | date = December 2013 | access-date = 13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Important figures==
Activists, educators, and public speakers have become a vital part of diversity training seminars. Some have become known specifically for their effective methods and their commitment in social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Liberman | first = Benjamin E. | title = Diversity trainer preconceptions: the effects of trainer race and gender on perceptions of diversity trainer effectiveness | journal = [[Basic and Applied Social Psychology]] | volume = 33 | issue = 3 | pages = 279&amp;ndash;293 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/01973533.2011.589327 | date = 2011 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/01973533.2011.589327| ref = harv | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2016}} Conferences often get owners of companies, human resources specialists, managers, and others involved with worker's rights to speak at these events because of their experience working with a diverse group of people. According to "Diversity Training University International students", the most important diversity pioneers include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Vaughn | first = Billy E. | title = The history of diversity training &amp; its pioneers | url = http://diversityofficermagazine.com/diversity-inclusion/the-history-of-diversity-training-its-pioneers/ | work = Diversity Officer Magazine Newsletter | date = August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conferences ==
Numerous types of diversity training conferences exist currently throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Experts Convene For Landmark Diversity Conference.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2016}} They have become an essential tool that a company now seeks for their employees. While most trainings are the same, some differ based on the type of sector and work the company does. Businesses look into diversity within the workplace but also within consumers while educators use diversity training as a way to learn adequate communication among students and parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lappin|first1=G|title=Diversity Training, Educational Equity, and Teacher Preparation Programs: The Promise of Multiculturalism| journal=International Journal of the Humanities|volume=5|issue=2|pages=109–113|url =http://ijh.cgpublisher.com/product/pub.26/prod.1005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most training is done through companies that specialize in the matter and certify those who conduct the conference.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}
