In the [[Hawaiian language]], a [[haole]] means "foreign" or "foreigner," and on Kill Haole Day, school children of Hawaiian ancestry harass, and sometimes assault white children. The origins of the day are unknown, but the tradition dates back to the 1950s.  

In 1999, "School Superintendent Paul LeMahieu said he is aware of "kill haole day" but is not aware of any recent incidents."&lt;ref&gt;[http://starbulletin.com/1999/03/24/news/story7.html ‘Kill haole day’ linked to hate-crime bill]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, it became an issue for [[hate crimes]] legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://starbulletin.com/1999/03/24/news/story7.html ‘Kill haole day’ linked to hate-crime bill]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaiireporter.com/story.aspx?294d9da5-dbb5-40e9-8f94-13712a73408c Waters of Life Teachers, Students, School Property, Assaulted by Gang of Kids from Nearby Public School]&lt;/ref&gt;
