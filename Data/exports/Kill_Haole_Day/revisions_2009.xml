On Kill Haole Day, school children of Hawai{{okina}}ian ancestry harass and sometimes assault white children. The origins of the day are unknown, but the tradition dates back to the 1950s.  

In the [[Hawaiian language]], ''[[haole]]'' means "foreign" or "foreigner". The word predates the [[1778]] arrival of Captain [[James Cook]] (which is the generally accepted date of first contact with westerners), as recorded in several chants stemming from antiquity. Haole, in its current definition, first became associated with the children of [[Caucasoid|Caucasian]] immigrants in the early 1820s. It unified the self-identity of these Hawai{{okina}}i-born children whose parents were as culturally different as the children were similar.  For Haole children whose first language was Hawai{{okina}}ian, their parents were generally either [[missionary|religious missionaries]] or secular businessmen, and hailed from both [[Europe]] and [[North America]], not necessarily speaking a common [[dialect]] or even language. Over the years, "Haole" became an expression of contempt. Though its first usage described members of a socioeconomic class, it added a racial component, erroneously replacing "malihini" (newcomer) in addressing first generation Hawai{{okina}}ians originally from the U.S. mainland. Today it is often applied to any Caucasian, or to those who think or behave in a "foreign" manner. In current application, Haole can be used either descriptively or as a racial slur (often, if not generally, preceded by an obscene invective).

In 1999, "School Superintendent Paul LeMahieu said he is aware of "kill haole day" but is not aware of any recent incidents."&lt;ref name="starbulletin"&gt;{{cite web
