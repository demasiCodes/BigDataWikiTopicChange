'''Kill Haole Day''' is an event that has occurred in some [[Hawaiia]]n schools, when non-white students are said to harass and sometimes attack [[White Hawaiian]] students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Kill Haole Day|author=Community Relations Commission|journal=New community|volume=7–8|page=267|issn=0047-9586|oclc=615546790|quote=My students talked of the High Schools' 'Kill Haole Day' when a day in the school year was dedicated to roughing up the whites.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2009 book, lawyer and former Hawai{{okina}}i governor [[Ben Cayetano]] wrote that "Kill Haole Day" began as a news story headline about an incident between [[haole]] and local (not just Hawaiian) students. After that, "whenever there was a fight or an incident between haole and non-haole students, the news media", and newspaper editorial boards, "repeatedly reprised 'Kill Haole Day' in their news stories".&lt;ref&gt;Cayetano, Ben. ''Ben: A Memoir, From Street Kid to Governor'' (Watermark, 2009), p. 531&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, School Superintendent Paul LeMahieu said he was aware of "kill haole day" but not aware of any recent incidents. Also, in 1999, it became an issue for [[hate crimes]] legislation.&lt;ref name="starbulletin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starbulletin.com/1999/03/24/news/story7.html|title=‘Kill haole day’ linked to hate-crime bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Newspaper columnist Lee Cataluna wrote in 2010, "In terms of actual, first-person, eyewitness accounts of Kill Haole Day, no one had any [incidents] that happened in the last three decades. Not one teacher, not one police officer, not one victim or perpetrator."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Catalune, Lee|title=Responses refute existence of any recent 'Kill Haole Day'|work=Honolulu Advertiser|date=November 23, 2010|url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/20101123_responses_refute_existence_of_any_recent_kill_haole_day.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 31, 2008, the U.S. Department of Education released a report that concluded there was "substantial evidence that students experienced racially and sexually derogatory name-calling on nearly a daily basis on school buses, at school bus stops, in school hallways and other areas of the school".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United States Department of Education - Office for Civil Rights|title=OCR Reference No 10051060|url=http://stopsexualassaultinschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/OCR-FOIA-cases-Hawaii.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report also concluded that school officials responded inadequately or not at all when students complained of racial harassment. Students who did complain were retaliated against by their antagonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Southern Poverty Law Center,|title=Hawaii Suffering From Racial Prejudice|url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2009/fall/prejudice-in-paradise}}&lt;/ref&gt;
