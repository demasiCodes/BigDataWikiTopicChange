'''Kill Haole Day''' is an annual event that some people claim occurs in some of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]]'s schools. On the last day of school before summer vacation, non-white students are said to harass and sometimes attack white students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|location=Great Britain|author=Community Relations Commission|journal=New community|volume=7â€“8|page=267|issn=0047-9586|oclc=615546790|quote=My students talked of the High Schools' 'Kill Haole Day' when a day in the school year was dedicated to roughing up the whites.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Hawaiian language]], ''[[haole]]'' means "foreign" or "foreigner".&lt;ref&gt;{{Hawaiian Dictionaries |Haole |accessdate= September 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
