The term ''state church'' is associated with [[Christianity]], and is sometimes used to denote a specific national branch of Christianity. Closely related to state churches are what [[sociology|sociologists]] call [[ecclesia (sociology of religion)|ecclesiae]], though the two are slightly different. State religions are examples of the official or government-sanctioned [[establishment of religion]], as distinct from [[theocracy]].


==Types of state churches==
The degree and nature of state backing for denomination or creed designated as a state religion can vary. It can range from mere endorsement and financial support, with freedom for other faiths to practice, to prohibiting any competing religious body from operating and persecuting the followers of other sects. In Europe, competition between Catholic and Protestant denominations for state sponsorship in the 16th century evolved the principle ''[[cuius regio eius religio]]'' ("states follow the religion of the ruler") embodied in the text of the [[treaty]] that marked the [[Peace of Augsburg]], [[1555]].

In some cases, a state may have a set of state-sponsored religious denominations that it funds; such is the case in [[Alsace-Moselle]] in [[France]], following the pattern in [[Germany]].

In some [[communist state]]s, notably the [[People's Republic of China]], the state sponsors religious organizations, and activities outside those state-sponsored religious organizations are met with various degrees of official disapproval. In these cases, state religions are widely seen as efforts by the state to prevent alternate sources of authority.  

===Sociology of state churches===
Sociologists refer to mainstream non-state religions as [[religious denomination|denominations]]. State religions tend to admit a larger variety of opinion within them than denominations. Denominations encountering major differences of opinion within themselves are likely to split; this option is not open for most state churches, so they tend to try to integrate differing opinions within themselves.  An exception to this is the [[Church of Scotland]] which has split several times in the past for doctrinal reasons.  Its largest offshoots were the [[Free Church of Scotland]] and the [[United Free Church of Scotland]].  These offshoots lost the established status of their parent, but since 1929 the reunited [[Church of Scotland]] has considered itself to be a "national church" rather than an established church, as it is entirely independent of state control in matters spirtitual. 

Increasingly, sociologists of religion are using the concept of [[monopoly|monopolies]] in economics as an analogy for state churches.

State religions typically exist in countries or jurisdictions where they the majority of residents are considered adherents; however much of this support is little more than nominal, with many members of the church rarely attending it. But the population's allegiance towards the state religion is often strong enough to prevent them from joining competing religious groups. Sociologists put this forward as an explanation for the religious differences between the United States and Europe: many sociologists theorise that the continuing vitality of religion in American life, compared to many European countries, is due to the lack of a state church at all during much of American history.

A denomination's status as official religion does not universally imply that the jurisdiction prohibits the existence or operation of other sects or religious bodies.  It all depends upon the government and the level of tolerance the citizens of that country have for each other.  Some countries with official religions have laws that guarantee the freedom of worship, full liberty of conscience, and places of worship for all citizens and implement those laws in society better than countries that do not have an official or established state religion.

==Disestablishment==

''See also [[secular state]].''

'''Disestablishment''' is the process of divesting a church of its status as an organ of the state. In Britain there was a campaign by [[The Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]], [[dissenter]]s and [[nonconformists]] to disestablish the [[Church of England]] in the late 19th century; it failed in [[England]], but demands for the measure persist to this day. The [[Church of Ireland]] was disestablished in 1869 and the Church of England was disestablished in Wales in 1920, becoming the [[Church in Wales]].   Those who wish to continue with an established church take a position of [[antidisestablishmentarianism]]. 

The [[First Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|US Constitution]] explicitly bans the [[federal]] [[government]] from setting up a state church. This did not, when ratified, prevent [[state government]]s from establishing a church, and [[Connecticut]] continued to do so until she replaced her colonial [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Charter]] with the [[History of Connecticut#The 1818 Constitution (1818-1890)|Connecticut Constitution of 1818]].  The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] forbids the states to violate the rights of citizens of the United States, those rights defended by the Constitution against the Federal Government; and thus prohibits state establishments also. The exact boundaries of this prohibition are still disputed and are a frequent source of cases before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]], especially as the court must reconcile the establishment clause of the First Amendment with the clause that prohibits restraints on the free exercise of religion. All present State Constitutions also include a clause parallel to the First Amendment.

In [[1967]], the Albanian government made [[state atheism|atheism]] the "state religion". This designation remained in effect until [[1991]]. &lt;BR&gt;

Finland's State Church was the [[Church of Sweden]] until [[1809]]. As an autonomous Grand Duchy under Russia 1809-1917, Finland retained the Lutheran State Church system, and a national church separate from Sweden was established. Since the independence in [[1917]], both the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]] and the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]] have got a constitutionally established special status.

In several colonies, the establishment ceased to exist in practice at the [[American Revolution|Revolution]], about [[1776]]; this is the date of legal abolition.

&lt;cite id="fn_2"&gt;[[#fn_2_back|Note 2:]]&lt;/cite&gt;
Replaced by a system which required every man to belong to a church, and permitted each church to tax its members. This was not, in theory, an establishment; but was sufficiently oppressive in practice, to be abolished in [[1833]].
