A '''state religion''' (also called an '''official religion''', '''established church''' or '''state church''') is a [[religion|religious]] body or [[creed]] officially endorsed by the [[Sovereign state|state]]. A state with an official religion, while not [[secular state|secular]], is not necessarily a [[theocracy]].

The term ''[[state church]]'' is associated with [[Christianity]], historically the [[state church of the Roman Empire]], and is sometimes used to denote a specific modern national branch of Christianity. Closely related to state churches are what [[sociology|sociologists]] call [[ecclesia (sociology of religion)|ecclesiae]], though the two are slightly different.

State religions are official or government-sanctioned establishments of a religion, but neither does the state need be under the control of the church (as in a theocracy), nor is the state-sanctioned church necessarily under the control of the state.

The institution of state-sponsored religious cults is ancient, reaching into the [[Ancient Near East]] and prehistory. The relation of religious cult and the state was discussed by [[Varro]], under the term of ''[[theologia civilis]]'' ("civic theology"). The first state-sponsored [[Christian church]] was the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], established in 301 AD.&lt;ref&gt;The Journal of Ecclesiastical History&amp;nbsp;– Page 268 by Cambridge University Press, Gale Group, C.W. Dugmore&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of state religion ==
The degree and nature of state backing for denomination or creed designated as a state religion can vary. It can range from mere endorsement and financial support, with freedom for other faiths to practice, to prohibiting any competing religious body from operating and to persecuting the followers of other sects. In Europe, competition between Catholic and Protestant denominations for state sponsorship in the 16th century evolved the principle ''[[cuius regio eius religio]]'' ("states follow the religion of the ruler") embodied in the text of the [[treaty]] that marked the [[Peace of Augsburg]], 1555. In [[England]] the monarch imposed Protestantism in 1533, with himself taking the place of the Pope, while in [[Scotland]] the [[Church of Scotland]] opposed the religion of the ruler.

In some cases, an administrative region may sponsor and fund a set of religious denominations; such is the case in [[Alsace-Moselle]] in [[France]] under its [[Local law in Alsace-Moselle|local law]], following the pattern in [[Germany]].

In some [[communist state]]s, notably in [[Religion in North Korea|North Korea]] and [[Religion in Cuba|Cuba]], the state sponsors religious organizations, and activities outside those state-sponsored religious organizations are met with various degrees of official disapproval. In these cases, state religions are widely seen as efforts by the state to prevent alternate sources of authority.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

=== State churches ===
There is also a difference between a "state church" and the broader term of "state religion". A "state church" is a state religion created by a state for use exclusively by that state, examples of which include the [[Church of England]] (which previously was a Catholic church until it was separated by [[Henry VIII]] in 1534). An example of a "state religion" that's not also a "state church", is [[Roman Catholicism]] in [[Costa Rica]] which was accepted as the state religion in the 1949 Constitution, despite the lack of a national church. In the case of the former, the state has absolute control over the church, but in the case of the latter the church is ruled by an exterior body (in the case of Catholicism, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] has control over the church). In either case, the official state religion has some influence over the ruling of the state. As of 2012, there are only [[State church|five state churches]] left, as most countries which once featured state churches have separated church and state, thus downgrading their state churches to "national churches". The most recent country to separate church and state was [[Church of Norway|Norway]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="digitaljournal"&gt;http://digitaljournal.com/article/324906&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="secularism"&gt;http://www.secularism.org.uk/news/2012/05/norway-shows-the-way-by-separating-church-and-state&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disestablishment===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Liberal Party (UK)]] --&gt;
{{Further|Secular state}}
Disestablishment is the process of depriving a church of its status as an organ of the state.  Opponents of disestablishment may be called by one of the longest words in the English language:  "[[Antidisestablishmentarianism|antidisestablishmentarians]]".

== Current state religions ==
Currently, the following religions are recognized as state religions in some countries (all are a variation of [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] or [[Buddhism]]).

=== Christian countries ===
The following states recognize some form of [[Christianity]] as their state or official religion (by denomination):

==== Catholic ====
Jurisdictions which recognize [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] as their state or official religion:

* [[Vatican City]] ([[theocracy]])

The large portion of western Europe which previously held to the [[Catholic Church|Catholic religion]] was known as [[Christendom]], which was nominally headed by the [[Holy Roman Empire]], a Catholic federation; after the advent of Protestantism and the subsequent [[Enlightenment]], Christendom slowly collapsed as different states declared themselves Protestant or [[separation of Church and state|separated the Church from the state]] altogether.

==== Eastern Orthodox ====
Jurisdictions which recognize one of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es as their state religion:

The internal structure of the church is described in the Orthodox Church Act. The church has a power to tax its members and corporations if a majority of shareholders are members. The church does not consider itself a state church, as the state does not have the authority to affect its internal workings or theology.

==== Protestantism ====
===== Lutheran =====
Jurisdictions which recognize a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church as their state religion include the [[Nordic countries]]. Membership is very high among the general population, however the amount of actively participating members and believers is considerably lower than in many other countries with similar membership statistics. Furthermore, all of these churches have lately seen decline in the fraction of the population being members.

The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]] has a special relationship with the Finnish state, its internal structure being described in a special law, the Church Act.&lt;ref name=FinlandConstitution /&gt; The Church Act can be amended only by a decision of the Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church and subsequent ratification by the parliament. The Church Act is protected by the Finnish constitution, and the state can not change the Church Act without changing the constitution. The church has a power to tax its members and all corporations unless a majority of shareholders are members of the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]]. The state collects these taxes for the church, for a fee. On the other hand, the church is required to give a burial place for everyone in its graveyards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The church does not consider itself a state church, as the Finnish state does not have the power to influence its internal workings or its theology, although it has a veto in those changes of the internal structure which require changing the Church Act. Neither does the Finnish state accord any precedence to Lutherans or the Lutheran faith in its own acts.

[[Sweden]] relegated their state church, [[Church of Sweden]], to a [[national church]] in 2000. In late 2009 the Church of Sweden had 71.3% of the population as its members in 2009 although only around 20% of the Swedish population believes in any religion. Memberships are high because until 1996 membership was compulsory, all born before 1996 have to actively leave the church.&lt;ref name="Church of Sweden statistics"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/default.aspx?id=100243&amp;did=246080 |title=Medlemmar 1972-2008, tabell och diagram |format=XLS, 22.5&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]] |language=Swedish |publisher=Svenska kyrkan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisdictions which recognize a [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] church as their state religion:

* [[Tuvalu]] ([[Church of Tuvalu]])

;Other
The [[Church of Scotland]] is recognized as the national church of [[Scotland]], but is not a state church and thus differs from the [[Church of England]]. Its constitution, which is recognised by acts of the British Parliament, gives it complete independence from the state in spiritual matters.&lt;ref&gt;Despite some official documentation (marriage registrations being a common example) describing the [[Church of Scotland]] as the "Established Church" the Kirk has always disclaimed that status.{{dubious|date=April 2012}} This was eventually acknowledged by the United Kingdom government within the [[Church of Scotland Act 1921]]. Since it has thus never been legally established it cannot be disestablished.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Cantons in Switzerland give official recognition to the main churches, i. e. both the [[Swiss Reformed Church]] and the Roman Catholic Church, except [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]] and [[Canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]]. Switzerland itself has no official religion.

==== Anglican ====
{{See also|State religion#Tabular summary}}

Jurisdictions that recognise an [[Anglican]] church as their state religion:

* [[England]] ([[Church of England]])
The [[Church of England]] is the officially established religious institution &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/history/ |title=The History of the Church of England |publisher=The Archbishops' Council of the Church of England|accessdate=2006-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[England]], and also the [[Mother Church]] of the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]]. It is the only established Anglican Church. The [[British monarchy|British monarch]] is the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]] and is Defender of the Faith.  In late-19th-century England there was a campaign by [[The Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]], [[dissenter]]s and [[nonconformists]] to disestablish the Church of England, which was viewed, in the period after civil [[Chartism|Chartist]] activism, as a discriminatory organisation placing employment and other access disabilities on non-members. The campaigners styled themselves "Liberationists" (the "Liberation Society" was founded by [[Edward Miall]] in 1853). Though their campaign failed, nearly all of the legal disabilities of nonconformists were gradually dismantled. The campaign for disestablishment was revived in the 20th century when Parliament rejected the 1929 revision of the [[Book of Common Prayer]], leading to calls for separation of Church and State to prevent political interference in matters of [[worship]].

[[Lord Spiritual|Lords Spiritual]], who are the 26 most senior Archbishops and Bishops in the [[Church of England|Church]] are reserved seats in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in the [[House of Lords]]. The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Archbishop of York]], [[Bishop of London]], [[Bishop of Durham]], and the [[Bishop of Winchester]] sit automatically with the 21 longest-serving Bishops.
Both the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] have proposed reserved seats for the [[Lord Spiritual|Lords Spiritual]] in a reformed [[House of Lords]] which would contain elected members. Plans to reform the house however, have been abandoned for this current Parliament and so all 26 [[Lord Spiritual|Lords Spiritual]] remain in their reserved seats.

=== Muslim countries ===

===Jewish countries===

[[Israel]] is defined in several of its laws as a "[[Jewish and democratic state]]" (''medina yehudit ve-demokratit''). However, the term "[[Jew]]ish" is a [[polysemy|polyseme]] that can relate equally to the Jewish people or religion (see: [[Who is a Jew?]]). The debate about the meaning of the term Jewish and its legal and social applications is one of the most profound issues with which Israeli society deals.

At present, there is no specific law or official statement establishing the Jewish ''religion'' as the state's religion. However, the State of Israel supports religious institutions, particularly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] ones, and recognizes the "religious communities" as carried over from those recognized under the British Mandate. These are: Jewish and Christian (Eastern Orthodox, Latin [Catholic], Gregorian-Armenian, Armenian-Catholic, Syrian [Catholic], Chaldean [Uniate], Greek Catholic Melkite, Maronite, and Syrian Orthodox). The fact that the Muslim population was not defined as a religious community is a vestige of the Ottoman period{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} during which Islam was the dominant religion and does not affect the rights of the Muslim community to practice their faith. At the end of the period covered by this report, several of these denominations were pending official government recognition; however, the Government has allowed adherents of not officially recognized groups freedom to practice. In 1961, legislation gave Muslim Shari'a courts exclusive jurisdiction in matters of personal status. Three additional religious communities have subsequently been recognized by Israeli law – the [[Druze]] (prior under Islamic jurisdiction), the Evangelical Episcopal Church, and the [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127349.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2009 : Israel and the occupied territories], U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.&lt;/ref&gt; These groups have their own religious courts as official state courts for personal status matters (see [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]]).

The structure and goals of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]] are governed by Israeli law, but the law does not say explicitly that it is a state Rabbinate. However, outspoken Israeli secularists such as [[Shulamit Aloni]] and [[Uri Avnery]] have long maintained that it is that in practice. Non-recognition of other streams of Judaism such as [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Conservative Judaism]] is the cause of some controversy; rabbis belonging to these currents are not recognized as such by state institutions and marriages performed by them are not recognized as valid. {{As of|2011}} [[marriage in Israel]] provides no provision for [[civil marriage]], marriage between people of different religions, marriages by people who do not belong to one of nine recognised religious communities, or [[same-sex marriage]]s, although there is recognition of marriages performed abroad.

=== Additional notes ===
* [[Nepal]] was once the world's only Hindu state, but has ceased to be so following a declaration by the Parliament in 2006.

* Many countries indirectly fund the activities of different religious denominations by granting tax-exempt status to churches and religious institutions which qualify as [[charitable organization]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

== Ancient state religions ==
=== Egypt and Sumer ===
{{See also|History of religion}}
The concept of state religions was known as long ago as the empires of [[Egypt]] and [[Sumer]], when every city state or people had its own god or gods. Many of the early Sumerian rulers were priests of their patron city god. Some of the earliest semi-mythological kings may have passed into the pantheon, like [[Dumuzid the Shepherd|Dumuzid]], and some later kings came to be viewed as divine soon after their reigns, like [[Sargon the Great]] of [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]. One of the first rulers to be proclaimed a god during his actual reign was [[Gudea]] of [[Lagash]], followed by some later kings of [[Ur]], such as [[Shulgi]]. Often, the state religion was integral to the power base of the reigning government, such as in Egypt, where Pharaohs were often thought of as embodiments of the god Horus.

=== Sassanid Empire ===
[[Zoroastrianism]] was the state religion of the [[Sassanid dynasty]] which lasted until 651, when Persia was conquered by the forces of Islam. However, it persisted as the state religion of the independent state of [[Hyrcania]] until the 15th century.

The tiny kingdom of [[Adiabene]] in northern Mesopotamia converted to Judaism around 34 AD.

=== Greek city-states ===
Many of the Greek city-states also had a 'god' or 'goddess' associated with that city. This would not be the 'only god' of the city, but the one that received special honors. In ancient Greece the city of [[Athens]] had [[Athena]], [[Sparta]] had [[Ares]], [[Delphi]] had [[Apollo]] and [[Artemis]], [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] had [[Zeus]], [[Corinth]] had [[Poseidon]] and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] had [[Demeter]].

=== Roman religion and Christianity ===
In Rome, the office of ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'' came to be reserved for the Emperor, who was often [[Apotheosis|declared a god]] posthumously, or sometimes during his reign. Failure to worship the Emperor as a god was at times punishable by death, as the Roman government sought to link emperor worship with loyalty to the Empire. Many Christians and Jews were subject to persecution, torture and death in the Roman Empire, because it was against their beliefs to worship the Emperor.

In 311, Emperor [[Galerius]], on his deathbed, declared a religious indulgence to Christians throughout the Roman Empire, focusing on the ending of anti-Christian persecution. [[Constantine I]] and [[Licinius]], the two ''Augusti'', by the [[Edict of Milan]] of 313, enacted a law allowing religious freedom to everyone within the Roman Empire. Furthermore, the Edict of Milan cited that Christians may openly practice their religion unmolested and unrestricted, and provided that properties taken from Christians be returned to them unconditionally. Although the Edict of Milan allowed religious freedom throughout the Empire, it did not abolish nor disestablish the Roman state cult (Roman polytheistic paganism). The Edict of Milan was written in such a way as to implore the blessings of the deity.

Constantine called up the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, although he was not a baptised Christian until years later. Despite enjoying considerable popular support, Christianity was still not the official state religion in Rome, although it was in some neighboring states such as [[Armenia]] and [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]].

[[Roman religion (disambiguation)|Roman Religion]] ([[Neoplatonic]] [[Religion in ancient Greece|Hellenism]]) was restored for a time by [[Julian the Apostate]] from 361 to 363. Julian does not appear to have reinstated the persecutions of the earlier [[Roman emperors]].

[[Catholic]] Christianity, as opposed to Arianism and other ideologies deemed heretical, was declared to be the [[State church of the Roman Empire|state religion of the Roman Empire]] on 27 February 380&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Theodosian Code |url=http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/latinlibrary/theod.html |work=THE LATIN LIBRARY at Ad Fontes Academy|publisher=Ad Fontes Academy |accessdate=2006-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the decree ''De Fide Catolica'' of Emperor [[Theodosius I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Theodosian Code XVI.i.2 |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/theodcodeXVI.html |work=Medieval Sourcebook: Banning of Other Religions |first=Paul |last=Halsall |year=1997 |month=June |publisher=Fordham University |accessdate=2006-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Han Dynasty Confucianism ===

In China, the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC – 220 AD) advocated [[Confucianism]] as the ''de facto'' state religion, establishing tests based on Confucian texts as an entrance requirement into government service—although, in fact, the "Confucianism" advocated by the Han emperors may be more properly termed a sort of Confucian [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] or "State Confucianism". This sort of Confucianism continued to be regarded by the emperors, with a few notable exceptions, as a form of state religion from this time until the overthrow of the imperial system of government in 1911.  Note however, there is a debate over whether Confucianism (including Neo-confucianism) is a religion or purely a philosophical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Confucian Religiosity: A Partial Bibliography  |url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln471/Confucian%20religiosity%20bib.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern era ==
=== Empire of Japan ===
From the [[Meiji era]] to the first part of the [[Showa era]], '' [[State Shinto|Koshitsu Shinto]]'' was established in Japan as the national religion. According to this, the [[Emperor of Japan]] was an [[arahitogami]], an incarnate divinity and the offspring of goddess [[Amaterasu]]. As the Emperor was, according to the constitution, "head of the empire" and "supreme commander of the Army and the Navy", every Japanese citizen had to obey his will and show absolute loyalty.

== States/Countries without a state religion ==
A state that does not profess a state religion is known as a "[[Secular state]]".

The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]], ratified in 1868, makes no mention of religious establishment, but forbids the states to "abridge the privileges or immunities" of U.S. citizens, or to "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law". In the 1947 case of [[Everson v. Board of Education]], the United States Supreme Court held that this later provision [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporates]] the First Amendment's Establishment Clause as applying to the States, and thereby prohibits state and local religious establishments. The exact boundaries of this prohibition are still disputed, and are a frequent source of cases before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] — especially as the Court must now balance, on a state level, the First Amendment prohibitions on government establishment of official religions with the First Amendment prohibitions on government interference with the free exercise of religion. See [[school prayer]] for such a controversy in contemporary American politics.

All current State constitutions do mention a Creator, but include guarantees of religious liberty parallel to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. The constitutions of eight states ([[Arkansas]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[North Carolina]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[South Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Texas]]) also contain clauses that prohibit atheists from holding public office.{{Cite web

However, these clauses were held by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] to be unenforceable in the 1961 case of ''[[Torcaso v. Watkins]]'', where the court ruled unanimously that such clauses constituted a religious test incompatible with the religious test prohibition in [[no religious test clause|Article 6 Section 3]] of the United States Constitution.

== Former state churches in British North America ==
=== Protestant colonies ===
* The colonies of [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]], [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Massachusetts Bay]], [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]], and [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] were founded by [[Puritan]] Calvinist Protestants.
* The colonies of [[Province of New York|New York]], [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], [[Province of North Carolina|North Carolina]], [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]], and [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] were officially [[Church of England]].

=== Catholic colonies ===
* When [[New France]] was transferred to [[Great Britain]] in 1763, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] remained under toleration, but [[Huguenot]]s were allowed entrance where they had formerly been banned from settlement by Parisian authorities.
* The [[Colony of Maryland]] was founded by a charter granted in 1632 to George Calvert, secretary of state to Charles I, and his son Cecil, both recent converts to Roman Catholicism. Under their leadership many English Catholic gentry families settled in Maryland. However, the colonial government was officially neutral in religious affairs, granting toleration to all Christian groups and enjoining them to avoid actions which antagonized the others. On several occasions, low-church dissenters led insurrections which temporarily overthrew the Calvert rule. In 1689, when William and Mary came to the English throne, they acceded to demands to revoke the original royal charter. In 1701, the Church of England was proclaimed, and in the course of the 18th century Maryland Catholics were first barred from public office, then disenfranchised, although not all of the laws passed against them (notably laws restricting property rights and imposing penalties for sending children to be educated in foreign Catholic institutions) were enforced, and some Catholics even continued to hold public office.
* [[Spanish Florida]] was ceded to [[Great Britain]] in 1763, the British divided Florida into two colonies. Both East and West Florida continued a policy of toleration for the Catholic Residents.

=== Colonies with no established church ===
* The [[Province of Pennsylvania]] was founded by [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], but the colony never had an established church.
* The [[Province of New Jersey]], without official religion, had a significant [[Quaker]] lobby, but Calvinists of all types also had a presence.
* [[Delaware Colony]] had no established church, but was contested between Catholics and Quakers.
* The [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]], founded by religious dissenters forced to flee the Massachusetts Bay colony, is widely regarded as the first polity to grant religious freedom to all its citizens, although Catholics were barred intermittently. Baptists, Seekers/Quakers and Jews made this colony their home.

No one religious society shall ever be established in this state, in preference to another; nor shall any person be denied the enjoyment of any civil right merely on account of his religious principles."

{{Note|MA|Note 3:}}
From 1780 Massachusetts had a system which required every man to belong to a church, and permitted each church to tax its members, but forbade any law requiring that it be of any particular denomination. This was objected to, as in practice establishing the Congregational Church, the majority denomination, and was abolished in 1833.

{{Note|NH|Note 4:}}
Until 1877 the New Hampshire Constitution required members of the State legislature to be of the Protestant religion.

{{Note|NC|Note 5:}}
The North Carolina Constitution of 1776 disestablished the Anglican church, but until 1835 the NC Constitution allowed only Protestants to hold public office. From 1835–1876 it allowed only Christians (including Catholics) to hold public office. Article VI, Section 8 of the current NC Constitution forbids only atheists from holding public office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://statelibrary.dcr.state.nc.us/nc/stgovt/article_vi.htm Article VI of the North Carolina state constitution]. Statelibrary.dcr.state.nc.us. Retrieved 5 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such clauses were held by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] to be unenforceable in the 1961 case of [[Torcaso v. Watkins]], when the court ruled unanimously that such clauses constituted a religious test incompatible with [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] Amendment protections.

{{Note|WEFL|Note 6:}}
Religious tolerance for Catholics with an established Church of England was policy in the former Spanish Colonies of East and West Florida while under British rule.

{{Note|EWFL|Note 7:}}
In [[Peace of Paris (1783)#Treaty with Spain|1783 Peace of Paris]], which ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], the British ceded both East and West Florida back to Spain (see [[Spanish Florida]]).

{{Note|VA|Note 8:}}
Tithes for the support of the Anglican Church in Virginia were suspended in 1776, and never restored. 1786 is the date of the [[Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom]], which prohibited any coercion to support any religious body.

=== Non-Anglo-American colonies ===

In both cases, these areas were disestablished and dissolved, yet their presences were tolerated by the Anglo-American government, as [[Foreign Protestants]], whose communities were expected to observe their own ways without causing controversy or conflict for the prevalent colonists. After the Revolution, their ethno-religious backgrounds were chiefly sought as the most compatible non-British Isles immigrants.

* [[New Netherland]] was founded by [[Dutch Reformed]] Calvinists.
* [[New Sweden]] was founded by [[Church of Sweden]] Lutherans.

=== State of Deseret ===
The [[State of Deseret]] was a provisional [[US State|state]] of the [[United States]], proposed in 1849 by [[Mormon]] settlers in [[Salt Lake City]]. The provisional state existed for slightly over two years, but attempts to gain recognition by the United States government floundered for various reasons. The [[Utah Territory]] which was then founded was under Mormon control, and repeated attempts to gain statehood met resistance, in part due to concerns over the principle of separation of church and state conflicting with the practice of members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] of placing their highest value on "following counsel" in virtually all matters relating to their church-centered lives. The state of [[Utah]] was eventually admitted to the union on 4 January 1896, after the various issues had been resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/statehood_and_the_progressive_era/struggleforstatehood.html Struggle For Statehood] Edward Leo Lyman, ''Utah History Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;
