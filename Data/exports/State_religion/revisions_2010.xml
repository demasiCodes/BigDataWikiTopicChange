A '''state religion''' (also called an '''official religion''', '''established church''' or '''state church''') is a [[religion|religious]] body or [[creed]] officially endorsed by the [[Sovereign state|state]]. Practically, a state without a state religion is called a [[secular state]]. The term ''state church'' is associated with [[Christianity]], historically the [[State church of the Roman Empire]], and is sometimes used to denote a specific modern national branch of Christianity. Closely related to state churches are what [[sociology|sociologists]] call [[ecclesia (sociology of religion)|ecclesiae]], though the two are slightly different. State religions are examples of the official or government-sanctioned establishment of religion, as distinct from [[theocracy]]. It is also possible for a national church to become established without being under state control. The first national [[Christian church|''church'']] was the [[Armenian Orthodox Church]] which was established in 301 A.D.&lt;ref&gt;The Journal of Ecclesiastical History – Page 268 by Cambridge University Press, Gale Group, C.W. Dugmore&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of state churches ==
The degree and nature of state backing for denomination or creed designated as a state religion can vary. It can range from mere endorsement and financial support, with freedom for other faiths to practice, to prohibiting any competing religious body from operating and to persecuting the followers of other sects. In Europe, competition between Catholic and Protestant denominations for state sponsorship in the 16th century evolved the principle ''[[cuius regio eius religio]]'' ("states follow the religion of the ruler") embodied in the text of the [[treaty]] that marked the [[Peace of Augsburg]], 1555. In [[England]] the monarch imposed Protestantism in 1533, with himself taking the place of the Pope, while in [[Scotland]] the [[Church of Scotland]] opposed the religion of the ruler.

In some cases, a state may have a set of state-sponsored religious denominations that it funds; such is the case in [[Alsace-Moselle]] in [[France]] under its [[Local law in Alsace-Moselle|local law]], following the pattern in [[Germany]].

In some [[communist state]]s, notably in [[North Korea]] and [[Cuba]], the state sponsors religious organizations, and activities outside those state-sponsored religious organizations are met with various degrees of official disapproval. In these cases, state religions are widely seen as efforts by the state to prevent alternate sources of authority.

=== State church vs state religion ===
There is also a difference between a "state church" and "state religion". A "state church" is created by the state,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} as in the cases of the [[Anglican Church]], created by [[Henry VIII]] or the [[Church of Sweden]], created by [[Gustav Vasa]]. An example of "state religion" is Argentina's acceptance of [[Roman Catholicism]] as its religion.&lt;ref name=ArgentinaConstitution /&gt; In the case of the former, the state has absolute control over the church, but in the case of the latter, in this example, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] has control over the church.

=== Sociology of state churches ===
Sociologists refer to mainstream non-state religions as [[religious denomination|denominations]]. State religions tend to admit a larger variety of opinion within them than denominations. Denominations encountering major differences of opinion within themselves are likely to split; this option is not open for most state churches, so they tend to try to integrate differing opinions within themselves.

Many sociologists now consider the effect of a state church as analogous to a chartered [[monopoly]] in religion.

Where state religions exist, it is usually true the majority of residents are officially considered adherents; however, in some cases support is little more than nominal with many members not practicing the religion regularly such as the case with the Anglican Church in England. In other cases, such as in many countries that have Islam as a state religion, the proportion of practicing members is quite high and other religions' presence in the country is negligible.

A denomination's status as official religion does not always imply that the jurisdiction prohibits the existence or operation of other sects or religious bodies. It all depends upon the government and the level of tolerance the citizens of that country have for other religions. Some countries with official religions have laws that guarantee the freedom of worship, full liberty of conscience, and places of worship for all citizens; and implement those laws more than other countries that do not have an official or established state religion.

==Disestablishment==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Liberal Party (UK)]] --&gt;
{{See|Secular state}}
Disestablishment is the process of depriving a church of its status as an organ of the state. Supporters of retaining an established church call themselves "antidisestablishmentarianists" — [[Antidisestablishmentarianism|one of the longest words]] in the English language.

=== Canada ===
[[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] guarantees freedom of religion.  Progressively, case law has led to the [[Freedom of religion in Canada|overturning of specific laws]] that reflected religious observances (essentially Christian). Notwithstanding this, Roman Catholic schools are constitutionally protected and funded by taxes in some provinces.

===United Kingdom===
== England ==
In late-19th-century England there was a campaign by [[The Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]], [[dissenter]]s and [[nonconformists]] to disestablish the [[Church of England]] which was viewed, in the period after civil [[Chartism|Chartist]] activism, as a discriminatory organisation placing employment and other access disabilities on non-members.

The campaigners styled themselves "Liberationists" (the "Liberation Society" was founded by [[Edward Miall]] in [[1853]]). Though their campaign failed, nearly all of the legal disabilities of nonconformists were gradually dismantled. The campaign for disestablishment was revived in the [[20th century]] when Parliament rejected the [[1929]] revision of the [[Book of Common Prayer]], leading to calls for separation of Church and State to prevent political interference in matters of [[worship]]. In the late 20th century, reform of the [[House of Lords]] also brought into question the position of the [[Lord Spiritual|Lords Spiritual]]. Another issue of controversy is the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] which determines succession to the [[British monarchy]], under which the head of state is also the head of the Church of England.

== Scotland ==
Despite some official documentation (marriage registrations being a common example) describing the [[Church of Scotland]] as the "Established Church" the Kirk has always disclaimed that status. This was eventually acknowledged by the United Kingdom government within the [[Church of Scotland Act 1921]]. Since it has thus never been legally ''Established'' it cannot be disestablished.

== Wales ==
{{Main|Welsh Church Act 1914}}
In Wales, four Church of England dioceses were disestablished in 1920, becoming separated from the Church of England in the process and subsequently becoming the [[Church in Wales]].

== Ireland ==
{{Main|Irish Church Act 1869}}
The (Anglican) state church was disestablished in 1871, becoming the [[Church of Ireland]]. The [[Constitution of Ireland]], in force since 1937, prohibits the state from endorsing any religion as an established church. Formerly, the constitution recognised the "special position" of the Catholic Church "as the guardian of the Faith professed by the great majority of the citizens", in addition with other religions, but these provisions were removed by the [[Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]] in 1973.

=== United States of America ===
The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]] explicitly forbids the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] from enacting any law respecting a religious establishment, and thus forbids either designating an official church for the United States, or interfering with [[U.S. State|State]] and local official churches — which were common when the First Amendment was enacted. It did not prevent [[state government]]s from establishing official churches. [[Connecticut]] continued to do so until it replaced its colonial [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Charter]] with the [[History of Connecticut#The 1818 Constitution (1818–1890)|Connecticut Constitution of 1818]]; Massachusetts retained an establishment of religion in general until 1833.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James H. Hutson|title=Religion and the new republic: faith in the founding of America|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YwW_g8qr68MC|year=2000|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780847694341|pages=[http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=YwW_g8qr68MC&amp;pg=PA22 22]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The Massachusetts system required every man to belong to some church, and pay taxes towards it; while it was formally neutral between denominations, in practice the indifferent would be counted as belonging to the majority denomination, and in some cases religious minorities had trouble being recognized at all.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}) {{as of|2010}} Article III of the Massachusetts constitution still provides, "... the legislature shall, from time to time, authorize and require, the several towns, parishes, precincts, and other bodies politic, or religious societies, to make suitable provision, at their own expense, for the institution of the public worship of God, and for the support and maintenance of public Protestant teachers of piety, religion and morality, in all cases where such provision shall not be made voluntarily."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/Constitution CONSTITUTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS], [http://malegislature.gov/ malegislature.gov].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]], ratified in 1868, makes no mention of religious establishment, but forbids the states to "abridge the privileges or immunities" of U.S. citizens, or to "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law". In the 1947 case of [[Everson v. Board of Education]], the United States Supreme Court held that this later provision [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporates]] the First Amendment's Establishment Clause as applying to the States, and thereby prohibits state and local religious establishments. The exact boundaries of this prohibition are still disputed, and are a frequent source of cases before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] — especially as the Court must now balance, on a state level, the First Amendment prohibitions on government establishment of official religions with the First Amendment prohibitions on government interference with the free exercise of religion. See [[school prayer]] for such a controversy in contemporary American politics.

All current State constitutions do mention a Creator,{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} but include guarantees of religious liberty parallel to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], but eight ([[Arkansas]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[North Carolina]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[South Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Texas]]) also contain clauses that prohibit atheists from holding public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

|accessdate=2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, these clauses have been held by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] to be unenforceable in the 1961 case of ''[[Torcaso v. Watkins]]'', where the court ruled unanimously that such clauses constituted a religious test incompatible with the religious test prohibition in Article 6 Section 3 of the United States Constitution.

=== Eastern Orthodox ===
Jurisdictions which recognize one of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es as their state religion:
* [[Greece]] ([[Church of Greece]])&lt;ref name=GreeceConstitution&gt;[http://www.hri.org/docs/syntagma/artcl25.html#A3 THE CONSTITUTION OF GREECE ]: SECTION II RELATIONS OF CHURCH AND STATE, [http://www.hri.org/ Hellenic Resources network].&lt;/ref&gt;

The church has a power to tax its members and corporations if a majority of shareholders are members. The church does not consider itself a state church, as the state does not have the authority to affect its internal workings or theology.

=== Protestantism ===
==== Lutheran ====
Jurisdictions which recognize a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church as their state religion contain the [[Nordic countries]]. Membership is very high among the general population, however the amount of actively participating members and believers is considerably lower than in many other countries with similar membership statistics. Furthermore, all of these churches have lately seen decline in the fraction of the population being members.

* [[Finland]]: [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]] has a special relationship with the Finnish state, its internal structure being described in a special law, the Church Act.&lt;ref name=FinlandConstitution /&gt; The Church Act can be amended only by a decision of the Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church and subsequent ratification by the parliament. The Church Act is protected by the Finnish constitution, and the state can not change the Church Act without changing the constitution. The church has a power to tax its members and all corporations unless a majority of shareholders are members of the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]]. The state collects these taxes for the church, for a fee. On the other hand, the church is required to give a burial place for everyone in its graveyards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=== Additional notes ===
* [[Israel]] is defined in several of its laws as a "[[Jewish and democratic state]]" (''medina yehudit ve-demokratit''). However, the term "[[Jew]]ish" is a [[polysemy|polyseme]] that can relate equally to the Jewish people or religion (see: [[Who is a Jew?]]). The debate about the meaning of the term Jewish and its legal and social applications is one of the most profound issues with which Israeli society deals. At present, there is no specific law or official statement establishing the Jewish ''religion'' as the state's religion. However, the State of Israel supports religious institutions, particularly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] ones, and recognizes the "religious communities" as carried over from those recognized under the British Mandate. These are: Jewish and Christian (Eastern Orthodox, Latin [Catholic], Gregorian-Armenian, Armenian-Catholic, Syrian [Catholic], Chaldean [Uniate], Greek Catholic Melkite, Maronite, and Syrian Orthodox). The fact that the Muslim population was not defined as a religious community is a vestige of the Ottoman period{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} during which Islam was the dominant religion and does not affect the rights of the Muslim community to practice their faith. At the end of the period covered by this report, several of these denominations were pending official government recognition; however, the Government has allowed adherents of not officially recognized groups freedom to practice. In 1961, legislation gave Muslim Shari'a courts exclusive jurisdiction in matters of personal status. Three additional religious communities have subsequently been recognized by Israeli law – the [[Druze]] (prior under Islamic jurisdiction), the Evangelical Episcopal Church, and the [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127349.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2009 : Israel and the occupied territories], U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.&lt;/ref&gt; These groups have their own religious courts as official state courts for personal status matters (see [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]]). The structure and goals of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]] are governed by Israeli law, but the law does not say explicitly that it is a state Rabbinate. Non-recognition of other streams of Judaism is the cause of some controversy. As of 2010, there is no civil marriage in Israel, although there is recognition of marriages performed abroad.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these religions are not established as state religions.

== Ancient state religions ==
=== Egypt and Sumer ===
{{See also|History of religion}}
The concept of state religions was known as long ago as the empires of [[Egypt]] and [[Sumer]], when every city state or people had its own god or gods. Many of the early Sumerian rulers were priests of their patron city god. Some of the earliest semi-mythological kings may have passed into the pantheon, like [[Dumuzid]], and some later kings came to be viewed as divine soon after their reigns, like [[Sargon the Great]] of [[Akkad]]. One of the first rulers to be proclaimed a god during his actual reign was [[Gudea]] of [[Lagash]], followed by some later kings of [[Ur]], such as [[Shulgi]]. Often, the state religion was integral to the power base of the reigning government, such as in Egypt, where Pharaohs were often thought of as embodiments of the god Horus.

=== Sassanid Empire ===
[[Zoroastrianism]] was the state religion of the [[Sassanid dynasty]] which lasted until 651, when Persia was conquered by the forces of Islam. However, it persisted as the state religion of the independent state of [[Hyrcania]] until the 15th century.

The tiny kingdom of [[Adiabene]] in northern Mesopotamia converted to Judaism around 34 AD.

=== Greek city-states ===
Many of the Greek city-states also had a 'god' or 'goddess' associated with that city. This would not be the 'only god' of the city, but the one that received special honors. In ancient Greece the city of [[Athens]] had [[Athena]], [[Sparta]] had [[Ares]], [[Delphi]] had [[Apollo]] and [[Artemis]], [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] had [[Zeus]], [[Corinth]] had [[Poseidon]] and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] had [[Demeter]].

=== Roman religion and Christianity ===
In Rome, the office of ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'' came to be reserved for the emperor, who was often declared a 'god' posthumously, or sometimes during his reign. Failure to worship the emperor as a god was at times punishable by death, as the Roman government sought to link emperor worship with loyalty to the Empire. Many Christians and Jews were subject to persecution, torture and death in the Roman Empire, because it was against their beliefs to worship the emperor.

In 311, Emperor [[Galerius]], on his deathbed, declared a religious indulgence to Christians throughout the Roman Empire, focusing on the ending of anti-Christian persecution. [[Constantine I]] and [[Licinius]], the two ''Augusti'', by the [[Edict of Milan]] of 313, enacted a law allowing religious freedom to everyone within the Roman Empire. Furthermore, the Edict of Milan cited that Christians may openly practice their religion unmolested and unrestricted, and provided that properties taken from Christians be returned to them unconditionally. Although the Edict of Milan allowed religious freedom throughout the empire, it did not abolish nor disestablish the Roman state cult (Roman polytheistic paganism). The Edict of Milan was written in such a way as to implore the blessings of the deity.

Constantine called up the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, although he was not a baptised Christian until years later. Despite enjoying considerable popular support, Christianity was still not the official state religion in Rome, although it was in some neighboring states such as [[Armenia]] and [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]].

[[Roman Religion]] ([[Neoplatonic]] [[Religion in ancient Greece|Hellenism]]) was restored for a time by [[Julian the Apostate]] from 361 to 363. Julian does not appear to have reinstated the persecutions of the earlier [[Roman emperors]].

[[Catholic]] Christianity, as opposed to Arianism and other ideologies deemed heretical, was declared to be the [[State church of the Roman Empire|state religion of the Roman Empire]] on February 27, 380&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Theodosian Code |url=http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/latinlibrary/theod.html |work=THE LATIN LIBRARY at Ad Fontes Academy|publisher=Ad Fontes Academy |accessdate=2006-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the decree ''De Fide Catolica'' of Emperor [[Theodosius I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Theodosian Code XVI.i.2 |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/theodcodeXVI.html |work=Medieval Sourcebook: Banning of Other Religions |first=Paul |last=Halsall |year=1997 |month=June |publisher=Fordham University |accessdate=2006-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Han Dynasty Confucianism ===

In China, the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC – 220 AD) advocated [[Confucianism]] as the ''de facto'' state religion, establishing tests based on Confucian texts as an entrance requirement into government service—although, in fact, the "Confucianism" advocated by the Han emperors may be more properly termed a sort of Confucian [[Legalism]] or "State Confucianism". This sort of Confucianism continued to be regarded by the emperors, with a few notable exceptions, as a form of state religion from this time until the overthrow of the imperial system of government in 1911.  Note however, there is a debate over whether Confucianism (including Neo-confucianism) is a religion or purely a philosophical system.

== Modern era ==
=== Empire of Japan ===
From the [[Meiji era]] to the first part of the [[Showa era]], '' [[State Shinto|Koshitsu Shinto]]'' was established in Japan as the national religion. According to this, the [[emperor of Japan]] was an [[arahitogami]], an incarnate divinity and the offspring of goddess [[Amaterasu]]. As the emperor was, according to the constitution, "head of the empire" and "supreme commander of the Army and the Navy", every Japanese citizen had to obey his will and show absolute loyalty.

== Former state churches in British North America ==
=== Protestant colonies ===
* The colonies of [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]], [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Massachusetts Bay]], [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]], and [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] were founded by Puritan Calvinist Protestants.
* The colonies of [[Province of New York|New York]], [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], [[Province of North Carolina|North Carolina]], [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]], and [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] were officially [[Church of England]].

=== Catholic colonies ===
* When [[New France]] was transferred to [[Great Britain]] in 1763, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] remained under toleration, but [[Huguenot]]s were allowed entrance where they had formerly been banned from settlement by Parisian authorities.
* The [[Colony of Maryland]] was founded by a charter granted in 1632 to George Calvert, secretary of state to Charles I, and his son Cecil, both recent converts to Roman Catholicism. Under their leadership many English Catholic gentry families settled in Maryland. However, the colonial government was officially neutral in religious affairs, granting toleration to all Christian groups and enjoining them to avoid actions which antagonized the others. On several occasions low-church dissenters led insurrections which temporarily overthrew the Calvert rule. In 1689, when William and Mary came to the English throne, they acceded to demands to revoke the original royal charter. In 1701 the Church of England was proclaimed, and in the course of the eighteenth century Maryland Catholics were first barred from public office, then disenfranchised, although not all of the laws passed against them (notably laws restricting property rights and imposing penalties for sending children to be educated in foreign Catholic institutions) were enforced, and some Catholics even continued to hold public office.
* [[Spanish Florida]] was ceded to [[Great Britain]] in 1763, the British divided Florida into two colonies. Both East and West Florida continued a policy of toleration for the Catholic Residents.

=== Colonies with no established church ===
* The [[Province of Pennsylvania]] was founded by [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], but the colony never had an established church.
* The [[Province of New Jersey]], without official religion, had a significant [[Quaker]] lobby, but Calvinists of all stripes also had a presence.
* [[Delaware Colony]] had no established church, but was contested between Catholics and Quakers.
* The [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]], founded by religious dissenters forced to flee the Massachusetts Bay colony, is widely regarded as the first polity to grant religious freedom to all its citizens, although Catholics were barred intermittently. Baptists, Seekers/Quakers and Jews made this colony their home.

No person within this state shall, upon any pretense, be deprived of the inestimable privilege of worshipping God in any manner agreeable to his own conscience, nor be compelled to attend any place of worship contrary to his own faith and judgment; nor shall he ever be obliged to pay tithes, taxes, or any other rate, for the building or repairing any place of worship, or for the maintenance of any minister or ministry, contrary to what he believes to be right, or hath voluntarily engaged. To do. No one religious society shall ever be established in this state, in preference to another; nor shall any person be denied the enjoyment of any civil right merely on account of his religious principles."

{{Note|MA|Note 3:}}
From 1780 Massachusetts had a system which required every man to belong to a church, and permitted each church to tax its members, but forbade any law requiring that it be of any particular denomination. This was objected to, as in practice establishing the Congregational Church, the majority denomination, and was abolished in 1833.

{{Note|NH|Note 4:}}
Until 1877 the New Hampshire Constitution required members of the State legislature to be of the Protestant religion.

{{Note|NC|Note 5:}}
The North Carolina Constitution of 1776 disestablished the Anglican church, but until 1835 the NC Constitution allowed only Protestants to hold public office. From 1835–1876 it allowed only Christians (including Catholics) to hold public office. Article VI, Section 8 of the current NC Constitution forbids only atheists from holding public office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://statelibrary.dcr.state.nc.us/nc/stgovt/article_vi.htm Article VI of the North Carolina state constitition]&lt;/ref&gt;  Such clauses were held by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] to be unenforceable in the 1961 case of [[Torcaso v. Watkins]], when the court ruled unanimously that such clauses constituted a religious test incompatible with [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] Amendment protections.

{{Note|WEFL|Note 6:}}
Religious tolerance for Catholics with an established Church of England was policy in the former Spanish Colonies of East and West Florida while under British rule.

{{Note|EWFL|Note 7:}}
In [[Peace of Paris (1783)#Treaty with Spain|1783 Peace of Paris]], which ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], the British ceded both East and West Florida back to Spain (see [[Spanish Florida]]).

{{Note|VA|Note 8:}}
Tithes for the support of the Anglican Church in Virginia were suspended in 1776, and never restored. 1786 is the date of the [[Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom]], which prohibited any coercion to support any religious body.

=== Non-Anglo-American colonies ===

In both cases, these areas were disestablished and dissolved, yet their presences were tolerated by the Anglo-American government, as [[Foreign Protestants]], whose communities were expected to observe their own ways without causing controversy or conflict for the prevalent colonists. After the Revolution, their ethno-religious backgrounds were chiefly sought as the most compatible non-British Isles immigrants.

* [[New Netherland]] was founded by [[Dutch Reformed]] Calvinists.
* [[New Sweden]] was founded by [[Church of Sweden]] Lutherans.

=== State of Deseret ===
The [[State of Deseret]] was a provisional [[US State|state]] of the [[United States]], proposed in 1849 by [[Mormon]] settlers in [[Salt Lake City]]. The provisional state existed for slightly over two years, but attempts to gain recognition by the United States government floundered for various reasons. The [[Utah Territory]] which was then founded was under Mormon control, and repeated attempts to gain statehood met resistance, in part due to concerns over the principle of separation of church and state conflicting with the practice of members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] of placing their highest value on "following counsel" in virtually all matters relating to their church-centered lives. The state of [[Utah]] was eventually admitted to the union on January 4, 1896, after the various issues had been resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/statehood_and_the_progressive_era/struggleforstatehood.html Struggle For Statehood] Edward Leo Lyman, ''Utah History Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;
