A '''state religion''' (also called '''official religion''') is a [[religion]] or [[creed]] officially endorsed by a [[sovereign state]]. A state with an official religion (also known as '''[[confessional state]]''' or '''religious state'''), while not a [[secular state]], is not necessarily a [[theocracy]]. State religions are official or government-sanctioned establishments of a religion, but the state does not need to be under the control of the [[clergy]] (as in a theocracy), nor is the state-sanctioned religion necessarily under the control of the state.

Official religions have been known throughout [[human history]] in almost all types of cultures, reaching into the [[Ancient Near East]] and [[prehistory]]. The relation of [[Cult|religious cult]] and the state was discussed by the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Latin]] scholar [[Marcus Terentius Varro]], under the term of ''[[theologia civilis]]'' ({{Literal translation|civic theology}}). The first state-sponsored [[Church (congregation)|Christian church]] was the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], established in 301 CE.&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Ecclesiastical History''. p. 268 by Cambridge University Press, Gale Group, C.W. Dugmore&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Christianity]], as the term ''church'' is typically applied to a place of worship for [[Christians]] or organizations incorporating such ones, the term ''state church'' is associated with Christianity as sanctioned by the government, historically the [[state church of the Roman Empire]] in the last centuries of the Empire's existence, and is sometimes used to denote a specific modern national branch of Christianity. Closely related to state churches are [[ecclesia (sociology of religion)|ecclesiae]], which are similar but carry a more minor connotation.

In the [[Middle East]], the majority of states with a predominantly [[Muslims|Muslim]] population have [[Islam]] as their official religion, though the degree of religious restrictions on citizens' everyday lives varies by country. Rulers of [[Saudi Arabia]] use both secular and religious power, while [[Iran]]'s secular presidents are supposed to follow the decisions of religious authorities since the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Islamic Revolution]]. [[Turkey]], which also has Muslim-majority population, became a secular country after [[Atatürk's reforms|Atatürk's Reforms]], although unlike the [[Russian Revolution]] of the same time period, it did not result in the adoption of [[state atheism]].

The degree to which an official national religion is imposed upon citizens by the state in contemporary society varies considerably; from high as in [[Religion in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]] and [[Religion in Iran|Iran]], to none at all as in [[Religion in Greenland|Greenland]], [[Religion in Denmark|Denmark]], [[Religion in England|England]], [[Religion in Iceland|Iceland]], and [[Religion in Greece|Greece]].

==Types==
The degree and nature of state backing for denomination or creed designated as a state religion can vary. It can range from mere endorsement (with or without financial support) with freedom for other faiths to practice, to prohibiting any competing religious body from operating and to persecuting the followers of other sects.{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}} In Europe, competition between [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations for state sponsorship in the 16th century evolved the principle ''[[Cuius regio, eius religio]]'' (states follow the religion of the ruler) embodied in the text of the treaty that marked the [[Peace of Augsburg]], 1555. In [[England]], [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] broke with Rome in 1534, being declared the [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]],{{efn|The headship was administrative and jurisdictional but did not include the ''potestas ordinis'' (the right to preach, ordain, administer the sacraments and rites of the Church which were reserved to the clergy).&lt;ref&gt;Bray, Gerald. ''Documents of the English Reformation'' James Clarke &amp; Cº (1994), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;}} the official religion of England continued to be "Catholicism without the Pope" until after his death in 1547,&lt;ref&gt;Neill, Stephen. ''Anglicanism'' Penguin (1960), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[Scotland]] the [[Church of Scotland]] assested spiritual independence from the state.{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}

In some cases, an administrative region may sponsor and fund a set of religious denominations; such is the case in [[Alsace-Moselle]] in [[France]] under its [[Local law in Alsace-Moselle|local law]], following the pre-1905 French concordatory legal system and patterns in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;The concerned religious communities are the [[Diocese of Metz|dioceses of Metz]] and [[Archdiocese of Strasbourg|of Strasbourg]], the Lutheran [[EPCAAL]] and the Reformed [[EPRAL]] and the three [[Consistory (Judaism)|Israelite consistories]] in Colmar, Metz and Strasbourg.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[communist state]]s, notably in [[Religion in North Korea|North Korea]] and [[Religion in Cuba|Cuba]], the state sponsors religious organizations, and activities outside those state-sponsored religious organizations are met with various degrees of official disapproval. In these cases, state religions are widely seen as efforts by the state to prevent alternate sources of authority.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===State churches===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2021}}
There is also a difference between a "state church" and the broader term of "state religion". A "state church" is a state religion created by a state for use exclusively by that state. An example of a "state religion" that is not also a "state church" is [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] in Costa Rica, which was accepted as the state religion in the 1949 Constitution, despite the lack of a [[national church]]. In the case of a "state church", the state has absolute control over the church, but in the case of a "state religion", the church is ruled by an exterior body; in the case of Catholicism, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] has control over the church. In either case, the official state religion has some influence over the ruling of the state. As of 2012, there are only five state churches left.{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}

===Disestablishment===
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Liberal Party (UK)]]--&gt;
{{Further|Secular state}}
Disestablishment is the process of repealing a church's status as an organ of the state. In a state where an established church is in place, opposition to such a move may be described as [[antidisestablishmentarianism]]. This word is, however, most usually associated with the debate on the position of the Anglican churches in the [[British Isles]]: the [[Church of Ireland]] (disestablished in [[Irish Church Act 1869|1871]]), the [[Church of England]] in [[Wales]] (disestablished in [[Welsh Church Act 1914|1920]]), and the Church of England itself (which remains established in England).{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}

===Buddhism===

===Christianity===
{{Main|Christian state|Christian republic|Christianity and politics|Christian democracy|Christian nationalism|Christendom}}
The following states recognize some form of [[Christianity]] as their state or official religion or recognize a special status for it (by denomination):

====Non-denominational Christianity====
* {{flag|Samoa}}: In June 2017, Parliament voted to amend the wording of Article{{nbsp}}1 of the constitution, thereby making Christianity the state religion. Part 1, Section (1)(3) reads "Samoa is a Christian nation founded on God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit." The status of the religion had previously only been mentioned in the preamble, which Prime Minister [[Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi]] considered legally inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wyeth|first1=Grant|title=Samoa Officially Becomes a Christian State|url=https://thediplomat.com/2017/06/samoa-officially-becomes-a-christian-state/|work=The Diplomat|date=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feagaimaali’i-Luamanu|first1=Joyetter|title=Constitutional Amendment Passes; Samoa Officially Becomes 'Christian State'|url=http://www.pireport.org/articles/2017/06/08/constitutional-amendment-passes-samoa-officially-becomes-christian-state|publisher=Pacific Islands Report|date=8 June 2017|access-date=16 June 2017|archive-date=11 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201111223748/http://www.pireport.org/articles/2017/06/08/constitutional-amendment-passes-samoa-officially-becomes-christian-state|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flag|Zambia}}: The preamble to the [[Constitution of Zambia|Zambian Constitution of 1991]] declares Zambia to be "a Christian nation", while also guaranteeing freedom of religion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/ELECTRONIC/26620/90492/F735047973/ZMB26620.pdf Constitution of Zambia]. Retrieved 19 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Catholicism====
Jurisdictions where [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] has been established as a state or official religion:
* {{Flag|Costa Rica}}: [[Article 75 of the Constitution of Costa Rica]] confirms that "The Catholic and Apostolic Religion is the religion of the State, which contributes to its maintenance, without preventing the free exercise in the Republic of other forms of worship that are not opposed to universal morality or good customs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.costaricalaw.com/Constitutional-Law/costa-rica-constitution-in-english.html|title=Costa Rica Constitution in English – Constitutional Law – Costa Rica Legal Topics|work=costaricalaw.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906224713/http://costaricalaw.com/Constitutional-Law/costa-rica-constitution-in-english.html|archive-date=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Flag|Holy See}}: It is an [[Elective monarchy|elective]], [[Theocracy|theocratic]] (or [[Sacerdotal state|sacerdotal]]), [[absolute monarchy]] ruled by the [[Pope]], who is also the [[Vicar of Christ]].&lt;ref name="pages"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-pages.com/vatican/vatican_city.asp |title=Vatican City |publisher=Catholic-Pages.com |access-date=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest state functionaries are all [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] clergy of various national origins. It is the sovereign territory of the [[Holy See]] ({{lang-la|Sancta Sedes}}) and the location of the Pope's official residence, referred to as the [[Apostolic Palace]].

=====Anglicanism=====
The Anglican [[Church of England]] is the established church in England as well as all three of the [[Crown Dependencies]]:

The Anglican [[Church in Wales]], the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] and the [[Church of Ireland]] are not established churches and they are independent of the Church of England. The [[British monarchy|British monarch]] is the titular [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]].

====Nordic Countries====
=====Lutheranism=====
Jurisdictions where a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church has been fully or partially established as a state recognized religion include the [[Nordic States]].
* {{flag|Denmark}}: Section 4 of the [[Constitution of Denmark]] confirms the [[Church of Denmark]] as the established church.&lt;ref name="DenmarkConstitution"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Denmark Constitution|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/da00000_.html|access-date=2023-01-02|website=www.servat.unibe.ch|language=en|at=Section 4, State Church}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{flag|Norway|size=23px}}: Until 2017, the [[Church of Norway]] was not a separate legal entity from the government. It was disestablished and became a [[national church]], a legally distinct entity from the state with special constitutional status. The King of Norway is required by the Constitution to be a member of the Church of Norway, and the church is regulated by special canon law, unlike other religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheu.org/state-and-church-move-towards-greater-separation-norway|title=International Humanist and Ethical Union – State and Church move towards greater separation in Norway|access-date=18 March 2015|date=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Jurisdictions that give various degrees of recognition in their constitutions to Lutheranism without establishing it as the state religion:
* {{flag|Finland}}: The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]] has a special relationship with the Finnish state, its internal structure being described in a special law, the Church Act.&lt;ref name="LL.M"&gt;{{Cite web|last=LL.M.|first=Prof. Dr. Axel Tschentscher|title=ICL &gt; Finland &gt; Constitution|url=http://servat.unibe.ch/icl/fi00000_.html|access-date=2021-06-23|website=servat.unibe.ch|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church Act can be amended only by a decision of the synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church and subsequent ratification by the Parliament of Finland. The Church Act is protected by the Constitution of Finland and the state cannot change the Church Act without changing the constitution. The church has the power to tax its members. The state collects these taxes for the church, for a fee. On the other hand, the church is required to give a burial place for everyone in its graveyards.&lt;ref name="LL.M"/&gt; The President of Finland also decides the themes for intercession days. The church does not consider itself a state church, as the Finnish state does not have the power to influence its internal workings or its theology, although it has a veto in those changes of the internal structure which require changing the Church Act. Neither does the Finnish state accord any precedence to Lutherans or the Lutheran faith in its own acts.
* {{flag|Sweden}}: The [[Church of Sweden]] was the state church of Sweden between 1527 when King Gustav Vasa broke all ties with Rome and 2000 when the state officially became secular. Much like in Finland, it does have a special relation to the Swedish state unlike any other religious organizations. For example, there is a special law that regulates certain aspects of the church&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Riksdagsförvaltningen|title=Lag (1998:1591) om Svenska kyrkan Svensk författningssamling 1998:1998:1591 t.o.m.

A majority of the population still belongs to the Church of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Riksdagsförvaltningen|title=Successionsordning (1810:0926); Svensk författningssamling 1810:1810:0926 – Riksdagen|url=https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/successionsordning-18100926_sfs-1810-0926|access-date=2021-06-23|website=www.riksdagen.se|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other/mixed====
* {{flag|Armenia}}: The [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] has a constitutional agreement with the [[Armenia|State]]: "The Republic of Armenia shall recognise the exclusive mission of the Armenian Apostolic Holy Church, as a national church, in the spiritual life of the Armenian people, in the development of their national culture and preservation of their national identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.am/parliament.php?id=constitution&amp;lang=eng|title=National Assembly of the Republic of Armenia|website=parliament.am}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flag|Dominican Republic}}: The constitution of the Dominican Republic specifies that there is no state church and provides for freedom of religion and belief. A [[concordat]] with the [[Holy See]] designates Catholicism as the official religion and extends special privileges to the Catholic Church not granted to other religious groups. These include the legal recognition of church law, use of public funds to underwrite some church expenses, and complete exoneration from customs duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=2011 Report on International Religious Freedom – Dominican Republic|url=https://www.refworld.org/docid/502105c67d.html|access-date=2023-01-02|website=Refworld|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flag|France}}: The [[local law in Alsace-Moselle]] accords official status to four religions in this specific region of France: [[Judaism]], [[Roman Catholicism]], [[Lutheranism]] and [[Calvinism]]. The law is a remnant of the Napoleonic [[Concordat of 1801]], which was abrogated in the rest of France by the [[1905 French law on the separation of Church and State|law of 1905]] on the [[separation of church and state]]. However, at the time, Alsace-Moselle had been [[Alsace-Lorraine|annexed by Germany]]. The Concordat, therefore, remained in force in these areas, and it was not abrogated when France regained control of the region in 1918. Therefore, the separation of church and state, part of the French concept of [[Laïcité]], does not apply in this region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Church-state tie opens door for mosque

* {{flag|Hungary}}: The preamble to the [[Constitution of Hungary|Hungarian Constitution of 2011]] describes Hungary as "part of Christian Europe" and acknowledges "the role of Christianity in preserving nationhood", while Article VII provides that "the State shall cooperate with the Churches for community goals."

===Status of religion in Israel===
{{See also|Jewish state}}
* {{flag|Israel}} is defined in several of its laws as a "[[Jewish and democratic state]]" (''medina yehudit ve-demokratit''). However, the term "[[Jew]]ish" is a [[Polysemy|polyseme]] that can describe the Jewish people [[Who is a Jew?|as either an ethnic or a religious group]]. The debate about the meaning of the term "Jewish" and its legal and social applications is one of the most profound issues with which Israeli society deals. The problem of the status of religion in Israel, even though it is relevant to all religions, usually refers to the status of [[Judaism]] in Israeli society. Thus, even though from a constitutional point of view Judaism is not the state religion in Israel, its status nevertheless determines relations between religion and state and the extent to which religion influences the political center.&lt;ref&gt;''Trouble in Utopia: The Overburdened Polity of Israel'', by Dan Horowitz and Moshe Lissak, pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Law of Return]], was passed on 5 July 1950, gives the global diaspora [[Jews]], the right to relocate to Israel and acquire [[Israeli citizenship]]. Section - (1) of that law declares that "Every Jew has the right to come to this country as an Oleh, "(Immigrant)". In the Law of Return, the State of Israel gave effect to the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]]'s "credo" which called for the establishment of Israel as a [[Sovereign]] [[Jewish state]] with [[Democracy|Democratic]] setups, ideals and values.&lt;ref&gt;International Commission of Jurists

The State of Israel supports religious institutions, particularly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] ones, and recognizes the "religious communities" as carried over from those recognized under the British Mandate—in turn derived from the pre-1917 Ottoman system of ''[[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millets]]''. These are Jewish and Christian ([[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Latin Catholic]], [[Gregorian-Armenian]], [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian-Catholic]], [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syriac Catholic]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean]], [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkite Catholic]], [[Maronites|Maronite Catholic]], and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]]). The fact that the Muslim population was not defined as a religious community does not affect the rights of the Muslim community to practice their faith. At the end of the period covered by the 2009 U.S. International Religious Freedom Report, several of these denominations were pending official government recognition; however, the Government has allowed adherents of not officially recognized groups the freedom to practice. In 1961, legislation gave Muslim Shari'a courts exclusive jurisdiction in matters of personal status. Three additional religious communities have subsequently been recognized by Israeli law: the [[Druze]] (prior under Islamic jurisdiction), the Evangelical Episcopal Church, and followers of the [[Baháʼí Faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2009-10-29|title=Israel and the occupied territories|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127349.htm|access-date=2023-01-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029164133/http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127349.htm |archive-date=29 October 2009|publisher=U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of Indonesia]] guarantees freedom of religion and the practice of other religions and beliefs, including traditional animistic beliefs. Indonesians who are practicing other unrecognized religions such as [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] and [[Jainism|Jains]] are often counted as "Hindu" while Indonesians practicing [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]] are often counted as "Christian" for governmental purposes.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} [[Atheism in Indonesia|Atheism]], although not prosecuted, is discouraged by the state ideology of ''[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]]''.

=== Roman religion and Christianity ===
{{Main|Roman imperial cult|Christianity as the Roman state religion}}
In Rome, the office of ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'' came to be reserved for the Emperor, who was occasionally [[Apotheosis|declared a god]] posthumously, or sometimes during his reign. Failure to worship the Emperor as a god was at times punishable by death, as the Roman government sought to link emperor worship with loyalty to the Empire. Many Christians and Jews were subject to persecution, torture and death in the Roman Empire because it was against their beliefs to worship the Emperor.{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}

In 311, Emperor [[Galerius]], on his deathbed, declared a religious indulgence to Christians throughout the Roman Empire, focusing on the ending of anti-Christian persecution. [[Constantine I]] and [[Licinius]], the two ''[[Augustus (title)|Augusti]]'', by the [[Edict of Milan]] of 313, enacted a law allowing religious freedom to everyone within the Roman Empire. Furthermore, the Edict of Milan cited that Christians may openly practice their religion unmolested and unrestricted, and provided that properties taken from Christians be returned to them unconditionally. Although the Edict of Milan allowed religious freedom throughout the Empire, it did not abolish nor disestablish the Roman state cult (Roman polytheistic paganism). The Edict of Milan was written in such a way as to implore the blessings of the deity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}

Constantine called up the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, although he was not a baptized Christian until years later. Despite enjoying considerable popular support, Christianity was still not the official state religion in Rome, although it was in some neighboring states such as [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]], [[Kingdom of Iberia (antiquity)|Iberia]], and [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}

[[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]] ([[Neoplatonic]] [[Religion in ancient Greece|Hellenism]]) was restored for a time by the Emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] from 361 to 363. Julian does not appear to have reinstated the persecutions of the earlier [[Roman emperors]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}

[[Catholic]] Christianity, as opposed to Arianism and other ideologies deemed [[heresy|heretical]], was declared to be the [[State church of the Roman Empire|state religion of the Roman Empire]] on 27 February 380&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Theodosian Code |url=http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/latinlibrary/theod.html |work=The Latin Library at Ad Fontes Academy|publisher=Ad Fontes Academy |access-date=2006-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the decree ''[[Edict of Thessalonica|De fide catolica]]'' of Emperor [[Theodosius I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Theodosian Code XVI.i.2 |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/theodcodeXVI.html |work=Medieval Sourcebook: Banning of Other Religions |first=Paul |last=Halsall |date=June 1997 |publisher=Fordham University |access-date=2006-11-23 |archive-date=27 February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227120555/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/theodcodeXVI.html |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Han dynasty Confucianism ===
In China, the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE – 220 CE) advocated [[Confucianism]] as the ''de facto'' state religion, establishing tests based on Confucian texts as an entrance requirement into government service—although, in fact, the "Confucianism" advocated by the Han emperors may be more properly termed a sort of Confucian [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] or "State Confucianism". This sort of Confucianism continued to be regarded by the emperors, with a few notable exceptions, as a form of state religion from this time until the [[1911 Revolution|collapse]] of the [[Monarchy of China|Chinese monarchy]] in 1912. Note, however, there is a debate over whether Confucianism (including [[Neo-Confucianism]]) is a religion or purely a philosophical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln471/Confucian%20religiosity%20bib.htm|title=Sources on Confucian religiosity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Yuan dynasty Buddhism ===
During the Mongol-led [[Yuan dynasty]] of China (1271–1368 CE), [[Tibetan Buddhism]] was established as the ''de facto'' state religion by the [[Kublai Khan]], the founder of the Yuan dynasty. The top-level department and government agency known as the [[Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs]] (Xuanzheng Yuan) was set up in [[Khanbaliq]] (modern [[Beijing]]) to supervise [[Buddhist monk]]s throughout the empire. Since Kublai Khan only esteemed the [[Sakya (Tibetan Buddhist school)|Sakya]] sect of Tibetan Buddhism, other religions became less important. Before the end of the Yuan dynasty, 14 leaders of the Sakya sect had held the post of [[Imperial Preceptor]] (Dishi), thereby enjoying special power.&lt;ref&gt;''History of civilizations of Central Asia.: A.D. 750 to the end of the fifteenth century''. Part two: The achievements, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Golden Horde and Ilkhanate ===
The Mongol rulers [[Ghazan]] of Ilkhanate and [[Öz Beg Khan|Uzbeg]] of Golden Horde converted to [[Islam]] in 1295 CE because of the Muslim Mongol emir [[Nawrūz (Mongol emir)|Nawruz]] and in 1313 CE because of [[Sufi]] [[Bukhara]]n [[sayyid]] and [[sheikh]] [[Ibn Abdul Hamid]] respectively. Their official favoring of Islam as the state religion coincided with a marked attempt to bring the regime closer to the non-Mongol majority of the regions they ruled. In Ilkhanate, [[Christians|Christian]] and [[Jewish]] subjects lost their equal status with Muslims and again had to pay the poll tax; Buddhists had the starker choice of conversion or expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;''Medieval Persia 1040–1797'', [[David Morgan (historian)|David Morgan]] p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[State of Deseret]] was an unrecognised provisional [[U.S. state|state]] of the United States, proposed in 1849, by [[Mormon]] settlers in [[Salt Lake City]]. The provisional state existed for slightly over two years, but attempts to gain recognition by the United States government floundered for various reasons. The [[Utah Territory]] which was then founded was under Mormon control, and repeated attempts to gain statehood met resistance, in part due to concerns that the principle of separation of church and state conflicted with the practice of members of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] placing their highest value on "following counsel" in virtually all matters relating to their church-centered lives. The state of [[Utah]] was eventually admitted to the union on 4{{nbsp}}January 1896, after the various issues had been resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/statehood_and_the_progressive_era/struggleforstatehood.html Struggle For Statehood] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110224120/http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/statehood_and_the_progressive_era/struggleforstatehood.html|date=10 January 2019}} [[Edward Leo Lyman]], ''Utah History Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;

| United States{{efn|The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]] explicitly forbids the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] from enacting any law respecting a religious establishment, and thus forbids either designating an official church for the United States, or interfering with [[U.S. state|State]] and local official churches—which were common when the First Amendment was enacted. It did not prevent [[state government]]s from establishing official churches. [[Connecticut]] continued to do so until it replaced its colonial [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Charter]] with the [[History of Connecticut#The 1818 Constitution (1818–1890)|Connecticut Constitution of 1818]]; Massachusetts retained an establishment of religion in general until 1833.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=James H. Hutson|title=Religion and the new republic: faith in the founding of America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YwW_g8qr68MC|year=2000|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0847694341|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YwW_g8qr68MC&amp;pg=PA22 22]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until its substitution by Article of Amendment XI in 1834, Article{{nbsp}}III of the Massachusetts constitution's bill of rights provided, "...{{nbsp}}the legislature shall, from time to time, authorize and require, the several towns, parishes, precincts, and other bodies politic, or religious societies, to make suitable provision, at their own expense, for the institution of the public worship of God, and for the support and maintenance of public Protestant teachers of piety, religion and morality, in all cases where such provision shall not be made voluntarily."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/Constitution Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts], [https://malegislature.gov/Laws/Constitution].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]], ratified in 1868, makes no mention of religious establishment, but forbids the states to "abridge the privileges or immunities" of U.S. citizens, or to "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law". In the 1947 case of [[Everson v. Board of Education]], the United States Supreme Court held that this later provision [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporates]] the First Amendment's Establishment Clause as applying to the States, and thereby prohibits state and local religious establishments. The exact boundaries of this prohibition are still disputed, and are a frequent source of cases before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]—especially as the Court must now balance, on a state level, the First Amendment prohibitions on government establishment of official religions with the First Amendment prohibitions on government interference with the free exercise of religion. See [[school prayer]] for such a controversy in contemporary American politics.

All current State constitutions do mention a Creator, but include guarantees of religious liberty parallel to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. The constitutions of eight states ([[Arkansas]], [[Maryland]], [[Mississippi]], [[North Carolina]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[South Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Texas]]) also contain clauses that prohibit atheists from holding public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.godlessgeeks.com/LINKS/StateConstitutions.htm |title=State Constitutions that Discriminate Against Atheists |publisher=godlessgeeks.com |access-date=2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/texas.htm
|title=Religious laws and religious bigotry – Religious discrimination in U.S. state constitutions |publisher=religioustolerance.com |access-date=2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these clauses were held by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] to be unenforceable in the 1961 case of ''[[Torcaso v. Watkins]]'', where the court ruled unanimously that such clauses constituted a religious test incompatible with the religious test prohibition in [[no religious test clause|Article{{nbsp}}6 Section{{nbsp}}3]] of the United States Constitution.
