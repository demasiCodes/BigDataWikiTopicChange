A '''state religion''' (also called an '''established religion''', '''state church''', '''established church''', or '''official religion''') is a [[religion|religious]] body or [[creed]] officially endorsed by the [[Sovereign state|state]]. A state with an official religion, while not [[secular state|secular]], is not necessarily a [[theocracy]] – a country whose rulers have in their hands both secular and spiritual authority.

Official religions have been known throughout [[History of the world|human history]] in almost all types of cultures. They were adopted by most ancient states, both monoethnic and polyethnic, and observing them was a requirement made to all citizens, and especially public officials.

Official religions justified and reinforced the type of government existing in a society. Sanctifying it as the most, or the only, correct (divine) one, they often put forward and/or supported ideas of its expansion to other lands, whether the latter already follow the same religion or, sometimes not.

As the term ''church'' is typically applied to a Christian place of worship and organizations incorporating such ones, the term ''state church'' is associated with [[Christianity]], historically the [[state church of the Roman Empire]] in the last centuries of the Empire's existence, and is sometimes used to denote a specific modern national branch of Christianity. Closely related to state churches are what [[sociology|sociologists]] call [[ecclesia (sociology of religion)|ecclesiae]], though the two are slightly different.

State religions are official or government-sanctioned establishments of a religion, but neither does the state need be under the control of the religion (as in a theocracy), nor is the state-sanctioned religion necessarily under the control of the state.

The institution of state-sponsored religious cults is ancient, reaching into the [[Ancient Near East]] and prehistory. The relation of religious cult and the state was discussed by [[Varro]], under the term of ''[[theologia civilis]]'' ("civic theology"). The first state-sponsored [[Christian church]] was the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], established in 301 AD.&lt;ref&gt;
The Journal of Ecclesiastical History&amp;nbsp;– Page 268 by Cambridge University Press, Gale Group, C.W. Dugmore&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Near East and Middle East, many states with mostly Islamic population have [[Islam]] as their state religion in its [[Shiite]] and [[Sunni]] variety, though the degree of religious restrictions on the citizen's everyday life varies. On the one hand, rulers of Saudi Arabia join secular and religious power in their hands, and Iran's secular presidents since the revolution of 1979 are supposed to follow decisions of religious authorities. Turkey, which also has mostly Muslim population, after its 1920s revolution became a secular country, though unlike Russian revolution of the same decade, it did not make the country atheistic.

The degree that an official religion is imposed upon citizens in contemporary society varies considerably from total as in [[Saudi Arabia]] to not at all as in [[Norway]].

==Types of state religion==
The degree and nature of state backing for denomination or creed designated as a state religion can vary. It can range from mere endorsement (with or without financial support) with freedom for other faiths to practice, to prohibiting any competing religious body from operating and to persecuting the followers of other sects. In Europe, competition between Catholic and Protestant denominations for state sponsorship in the 16th century evolved the principle ''[[cuius regio eius religio]]'' ("states follow the religion of the ruler") embodied in the text of the [[treaty]] that marked the [[Peace of Augsburg]], 1555. In England, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] broke with Rome in 1534, being declared the "Supreme Head on earth of the Church of England",&lt;ref&gt;The headship was administrative and jurisdictional but did not include the ''potestas ordinis'' (the right to preach, ordain, administer the sacraments and rites of the Church which were reserved to the clergy) &amp;ndash;Bray, Gerald. ''Documents of the English Reformation'' James Clarke &amp; Cº(1994), p.114&lt;/ref&gt; the official religion of England continued to be "Catholicism without the Pope" until after his death in 1547,&lt;ref&gt;Neill, Stephen. ''Anglicanism'' Penguin (1960), p.61&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[Scotland]] the [[Church of Scotland]] opposed the religion of the ruler.

In some cases, an administrative region may sponsor and fund a set of religious denominations; such is the case in [[Alsace-Moselle]] in [[France]] under its [[Local law in Alsace-Moselle|local law]], following the pre-1905 French concordatry legal system and patterns in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;The concerned religious communities are the [[Diocese of Metz|dioceses of Metz]] and [[Archdiocese of Strasbourg|of Strasbourg]], the Lutheran [[EPCAAL]] and the Reformed [[EPRAL]] and the three [[Consistory (Judaism)|Israelite consistories]] in Colmar, Metz and Strasbourg.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[communist state]]s, notably in [[Religion in North Korea|North Korea]] and [[Religion in Cuba|Cuba]], the state sponsors religious organizations, and activities outside those state-sponsored religious organizations are met with various degrees of official disapproval. In these cases, state religions are widely seen as efforts by the state to prevent alternate sources of authority.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===State churches===
There is also a difference between a "state church" and the broader term of "state religion".{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} A "state church" is a state religion created by a state for use exclusively by that state.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}{{clarify|Please give an example of a "state religion created by a state for use exclusively by that state" or otherwise make it much clearer|date=March 2016}} An example of a "state religion" that's not also a "state church" is [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] in [[Costa Rica]], which was accepted as the state religion in the 1949 Constitution, despite the lack of a national church. In the case of a "state church", the state has absolute control over the church, but in the case of a "state religion", the church is ruled by an exterior body; in the case of Catholicism, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] has control over the church. In either case, the official state religion has some influence over the ruling of the state.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} As of 2012, there are only seven state churches left,{{what|Whiche ones?|date=November 2016}} as most countries that once featured state churches have separated the church from their government.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

===Disestablishment===
&lt;!---This section is linked from [[Liberal Party (UK)]]---&gt;
{{further|Secular state}}

Disestablishment is the process of repealing a church's status as an organ of the state. Opponents of disestablishment of the [[Church of England]] were known as [[Antidisestablishmentarianism|antidisestablishmentarians]].

==Current state religions==
Currently, the following religions have been established as state religions in some countries. All are versions of [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] or [[Buddhism]].

===Christian countries===
{{main article|Christianity and politics|Christian democracy|Canon law|Christendom}}
The following states recognize some form of [[Christianity]] as their state or official religion (by denomination):

====Roman Catholicism====
Jurisdictions where [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] has been established as a state or official religion:

* {{Flag|Costa Rica}}: article 75 of the [[constitution of Costa Rica]] confirms that ''"The Roman Catholic and Apostolic Religion is the religion of the State, which contributes to its maintenance, without preventing the free exercise in the Republic of other forms of worship that are not opposed to universal morality or good customs."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.costaricalaw.com/Constitutional-Law/costa-rica-constitution-in-english.html|title=Costa Rica Constitution in English - Constitutional Law - Costa Rica Legal Topics|author=Super User|work=costaricalaw.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Flag|Liechtenstein}}: the [[constitution of Liechtenstein]] describes the Catholic Church as the state religion and enjoying ''"the full protection of the State"''. The constitution does however ensure that people of other faiths ''"shall be entitled to practise their creeds and to hold religious services to the extent consistent with morality and public order."''&lt;ref name=LiechtensteinConstitution&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326162534/http://www.liechtenstein.li/en/pdf-fl-staat-verfassung-sept2003.pdf |date=26 March 2009 |title=Constitution Religion }} (archived from [http://www.liechtenstein.li/en/pdf-fl-staat-verfassung-sept2003.pdf the original] on 2009-03-26).&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Flag|Malta}}: Article 2 of the [[Constitution of Malta]] declares that "the religion of Malta is the Roman Catholic Apostolic Religion"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mjha.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lom&amp;itemid=8566|title=Constitution of Malta (Article 2)|publisher= mjha.gov.mt }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Flag|Monaco}}: article 9 of the [[constitution of Monaco]] describes ''"La religion catholique, apostolique et romaine"'' [the catholic, [[apostolic succession|apostolic]] and Roman religion]" as the religion of the state.&lt;ref name=MonacoReligion&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927091747/http://www.gouv.mc/devwww/wwwnew.nsf/1909$/036c62fe5f92f2efc1256f5b0054fa42gb?OpenDocument&amp;3Gb |date=27 September 2011 |title=CONSTITUTION DE LA PRINCIPAUTE }} (French): Art. 9., Principaute De Monaco: Ministère d'Etat (archived from [http://www.gouv.mc/devwww/wwwnew.nsf/1909$/036c62fe5f92f2efc1256f5b0054fa42gb?OpenDocument&amp;3Gb the original] on 2011-09-27).&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Flag|Vatican City}}: the Vatican is an [[Elective monarchy|Elective]], [[Theocracy|Theocratic]], or [[Sacerdotal state|sacerdotal]] [[Absolute Monarchy]]&lt;ref name=pages&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-pages.com/vatican/vatican_city.asp |title=Vatican City |publisher=Catholic-Pages.com |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ruled by the [[Pope]], who is also the [[Vicar]] of the Catholic Church. The highest state functionaries are all [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] clergy of various national origins. It is the sovereign territory of the [[Holy See]] ({{lang-la|Sancta Sedes}}) and the location of the Pope's official residence, referred to as the [[Apostolic Palace]].

Jurisdictions that give various degrees of recognition in their constitutions to Roman Catholicism without establishing it as the state religion:

* {{flag|Andorra}}
* {{flag|Argentina}} – article 2 of the [[Constitution of Argentina|Constitution]] explicitly states that the government supports the Catholic Church, but the constitution does not establish a state religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitiosargentina.com.ar/2/CONSTITUCION_NACIONAL_ARGENTINA.htm|title=CONSTITUCION NACIONAL ARGENTINA|work=DIARIOS Y NOTICIAS DE ARGENTINA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argentina.gob.ar/pais/56-religion.php|title=Argentina - Religión|work=argentina.gob.ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flag|Dominican Republic}}
* {{flag|El Salvador}}
* {{Flag|Panama}} – the [[Constitution of Panama|Constitution]] recognizes Catholicism as "the religion of the majority" of citizens but does not designate it as the official state religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/222609.pdf Executive Summary - Panama], 2013 [[Report on International Religious Freedom]], United States Department of State.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Flag|Paraguay}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of the Republic of Paraguay|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/pa00000_.html|quote=The role played by the Catholic Church in the historical and cultural formation of the Republic is hereby recognized.|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Flag|Peru}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of the Republic of Peru|url=http://www.congreso.gob.pe/_ingles/CONSTITUTION_29_08_08.pdf|quote=Within an independent and autonomous system, the State recognizes the Catholic Church as an important element in the historical, cultural, and moral formation of Peru and lends it its cooperation. The State respects other denominations and may establish forms of collaboration with them.|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flag|Poland}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Republic of Poland|date=1997-04-02|url=http://sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/angielski/kon1.htm|quote=The relations between the Republic of Poland and the Roman Catholic Church shall be determined by international treaty concluded with the Holy See, and by statute. The relations between the Republic of Poland and other churches and religious organizations shall be determined by statutes adopted pursuant to agreements concluded between their appropriate representatives and the Council of Ministers.|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eastern Orthodoxy====
The jurisdictions below give various degrees of recognition in their constitutions to [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], but without establishing it as the state religion:
* {{flag|Greece}}: The [[Church of Greece]] is recognized by the Greek Constitution as the prevailing religion in Greece.&lt;ref name=GreeceConstitution&gt;[http://www.hri.org/docs/syntagma/artcl25.html#A3] THE CONSTITUTION OF GREECE: SECTION II RELATIONS OF CHURCH AND STATE: Article 3, [http://www.hri.org/ Hellenic Resources network].&lt;/ref&gt; However, this provision does not give official status to the Church of Greece, while all other religions are recognized as equal and may be practiced freely.&lt;ref name=GreeceConstitution2&gt;[http://www.hri.org/docs/syntagma/artcl25.html#A13] THE CONSTITUTION OF GREECE: PART TWO INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL RIGHTS: Article 13&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this provision is considered a dead letter and can only be interpreted as a nationalistic historical remnant.
* {{flag|Georgia}}: [[Georgian Orthodox Church]] is not the state church of Georgia but has a special constitutional agreement with the state, with the constitution recognising ''"the special role of the Apostolic Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Georgia in the history of Georgia and its independence from the state."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.ge/en/kanonmdebloba/constitution-of-georgia-68 Constitution of Georgia] Article 9(1&amp;2) and 73(1a{{sup|1}})&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Concordat of 2002]])
* {{flag|Bulgaria}}: in the Bulgarian Constitution, the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] is recognized as "the traditional religion" of the Bulgarian people, but the state itself remains secular.

====Protestantism====

=====Anglicanism=====
* {{flag|England}}: the [[Church of England]] is the established church in England, but not in the [[United Kingdom]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/history/ |title=The History of the Church of England |publisher=The Archbishops' Council of the Church of England|accessdate=2006-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only established Anglican church worldwide. The Anglican [[Church in Wales]], the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] and the [[Church of Ireland]] are not established churches and they are independent from the Church of England. The [[British monarchy|British monarch]] is the titular [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]]. The 26 most senior bishops in the Church of England are [[Lords Spiritual]] and have seats in the [[House of Lords]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]]. Scottish, Welsh and Irish Anglican bishops do not sit in the House of Lords.

In the 19th century, there was a campaign by [[The Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]], [[dissenter]]s and [[nonconformists]] to disestablish the Church of England. The campaign for disestablishment was revived in the 20th century when Parliament rejected the [[1928 Prayer Book|1928 revision]] of the [[Book of Common Prayer]], leading to calls for separation of church and state to prevent political interference in matters of [[worship]]. Nevertheless, the Church of England remained the state church.

=====Calvinism=====
* {{flag|Tuvalu}}: The [[Church of Tuvalu]] is the state religion, although in practice this merely entitles it to "the privilege of performing special services on major national events".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/docid/4cf2d05cc.html "2010 Report on International Religious Freedom - Tuvalu"], [[United States Department of State]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitution of Tuvalu]] guarantees freedom of religion, including the freedom to practice, the freedom to change religion, the right not to receive religious instruction at school or to attend religious ceremonies at school, and the right not to "take an oath or make an affirmation that is contrary to his religion or belief".&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Tuvalu, article 23.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* {{flag|Scotland}}: The [[Church of Scotland]] is recognized as the national church of [[Scotland]], but is not a state church and thus differs from the [[Church of England]]. Its constitution, which is recognised by acts of the British Parliament, gives it complete independence from the state.

=====Lutheranism=====
{{Disputed-section|Nordic countries|date=November 2016}}
Jurisdictions where a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church has been established as a state religion include the [[Nordic countries]].

* {{flag|Denmark}}: section 4 of the Danish constitution confirms the [[Church of Denmark]] as the state church.&lt;ref name=DenmarkConstitution&gt;[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/da00000_.html Denmark – Constitution]: Section 4 State Church, [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/ International Constitutional Law].&lt;/ref&gt;
** {{flag|Faroe Islands}}: the [[Church of the Faroe Islands]] is the state church of the [[Faroe Islands]], an [[autonomous administrative division|autonomous]] country within the [[Danish Realm]].
** {{flag|Greenland}}: the [[Church of Denmark]] is the state church of [[Greenland]], an [[autonomous administrative division|autonomous]] country within the [[Danish Realm]].
* {{flag|Iceland}}: the [[Constitution of Iceland|Icelandic constitution]] confirms the [[Church of Iceland]] as the state church of Iceland.&lt;ref name=IcelandConstitution&gt;[http://www.government.is/constitution/ Constitution of the Republic of Iceland]: Article 62, [http://www.government.is/ Government of Iceland].&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flag|Norway}}: the [[Constitution of Norway]] stipulates that ''"[[Church of Norway|The Church of Norway]], an Evangelical-Lutheran church, will remain the Established Church of Norway and will as such be supported by the State."''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stortinget.no/globalassets/pdf/constitutionenglish.pdf The Constitution of Norway, Article 16 (English translation, published by the Norwegian Parliament)]&lt;/ref&gt; This was amended in 2012, from ''"Evangelical-Lutheran religion remains the public religion of the State"''. The church is granted autonomy in doctrine and appointment of bishops.&lt;ref name="abcnyheter"&gt;[http://www.abcnyheter.no/nyheter/080410/losere-band-men-fortsatt-statskirke Løsere bånd, men fortsatt statskirke], ABC Nyheter&lt;!-- http://www.webcitation.org/6DEb3MkkC --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/norge/1.8076910 Staten skal ikke lenger ansette biskoper], NRK&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fritanke.no/index.php?page=vis_nyhet&amp;NyhetID=8840|title=Ingen avskaffelse: / Slik blir den nye statskirkeordningen|author=Human-Etisk Forbund|work=Fritanke.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bill passed in 2016 creates the Church of Norway as an independent legal entity from 1 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/offisielt-fra-statsradet/id2501869/ Offisielt frå statsrådet 27. mai 2016] regjeringen.no «Sanksjon av Stortingets vedtak 18. mai 2016 til lov om endringer i kirkeloven (omdanning av Den norske kirke til eget rettssubjekt m.m.)

* {{flag|Finland}}: the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]] has a special relationship with the Finnish state, its internal structure being described in a special law, the Church Act.&lt;ref name=FinlandConstitution&gt;[http://servat.unibe.ch/icl/fi00000_.html Finland – Constitution], Section 76 The Church Act, http://servat.unibe.ch/icl/fi00000_.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The Church Act can be amended only by a decision of the synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church and subsequent ratification by the [[Parliament of Finland]]. The Church Act is protected by the [[Constitution of Finland|Finnish Constitution]] and the state can not change the Church Act without changing the constitution. The church has a power to tax its members and all corporations unless a majority of shareholders are members of the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]]. The state collects these taxes for the church, for a fee. On the other hand, the church is required to give a burial place for everyone in its graveyards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eroakirkosta.fi/media/english/status_of_the_finnish_state_church_in_2007.html#privileges |title=Status of the Finnish State Church in 2007—Privileges of the State Church |date=7 October 2007 |publisher=eroakirkosta.fi |accessdate=2007-10-23 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[President of the Republic of Finland]] also decides the themes for intercession days. The church does not consider itself a state church, as the Finnish state does not have the power to influence its internal workings or its theology, although it has a veto in those changes of the internal structure which require changing the Church Act. Neither does the Finnish state accord any precedence to Lutherans or the Lutheran faith in its own acts. The [[Union of Freethinkers of Finland]] has criticized the official endorsement of the two churches by the Finnish state, and has campaigned for the separation of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eroakirkosta.fi]] - [http://eroakirkosta.fi/media/taustatietoa/toiminta-ajatus.html Palvelun tavoite: Kirkko on erotettava valtiosta]&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flag|Sweden}}: the [[Church of Sweden]] was until 2000 the official state church of Sweden, and Lutheranism was therefore the state religion of Sweden. In spite of the separation between the state and the church in 2000, the [[Church of Sweden]] still has a special status in Sweden. Sweden is therefore often seen as a midway between having a state religion and not. The church has its own legal regulation in the 1998 Church of Sweden Act, which regulates the church's basic structure, creeds and right to tax members of the church. According to the Act, the Church of Sweden must be a democratic, Lutheran people's church. Only the Swedish [[Riksdag]] can change this fact. The connections to the [[Swedish royal family]] are complicated. For example, the Swedish constitution stipulates that the [[Monarch of Sweden]] must be a true Lutheran, accepting the doctrine of the Church of Sweden. All members of the [[royal house]] must accept the same doctrine to be able to inherit the [[Monarchy of Sweden|Throne of Sweden]]. The parishes of the Church of Sweden were the smallest administrative entities in Sweden and were used as civil registration and taxation units until 1 January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.raa.se/2014/06/framtidens-folkbokforing-efter-distrikt-istallet-for-forsamling-2/ |title= Framtidens folkbokföring efter distrikt istället för församling|publisher=Swedish National Heritage Board |language= Swedish |author=Cecilia Olla |date=12 June 2014 |accessdate= 31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Methodism=====
* {{flag|Tonga}}: The [[Free Wesleyan Church of Tonga]]
In 1928, Queen [[Salote Tupou III]], who was a member of the church, established the Free Wesleyan Church as the state religion of Tonga.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The chief pastor of the Free Wesleyan Church serves as the representative of the people of Tonga and of the Church at the coronation of a King or Queen of Tonga where he anoints and crowns the Monarch. In Opposition to the establishment of the Free Wesleyan Church as a state religion, the [[Church of Tonga]] separated from the Free Wesleyan Church in 1928.

====Other/Mixed====
* {{flag|France}}: The [[local law in Alsace-Moselle]] accords official status to four religions in this specific region of France: [[Judaism]], [[Roman Catholicism]], [[Lutheranism]] and [[Calvinism]]. The law is a remnant of the Napoleonic [[Concordat of 1801]], which was abrogated in the rest of France by the [[1905 French law on the separation of Church and State|law of 1905]] on the [[separation of church and state]].  However, at the time, Alsace-Moselle had been [[Alsace-Lorraine|annexed by Germany]]. The Concordat therefore remained in force in these areas, and it was not abrogated when France regained control of the region in 1918. The Concordat recognises four religious traditions in Alsace-Moselle: the Jewish religion and three branches of Christianity: Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed. Therefore, the separation of church and state, part of the French concept of [[Laïcité]], does not apply in this region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Church-state tie opens door for mosque

* {{flag|Hungary}}: The preamble to the [[Constitution of Hungary|Hungarian Constitution of 2011]] describes Hungary as "part of Christian Europe" and acknowledges "the role of Christianity in preserving nationhood", while Article VII provides that "the State shall cooperate with the Churches for community goals". However, the constitution also guarantees freedom of religion and separation of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Hungary_2011.pdf Hungary's Constitution of 2011]. Retrieved 9 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muslim countries===
{{main article|Political aspects of Islam|Sharia|Caliphate|Islamic religious police (disambiguation)|Islamism}}
{{refimprove section|date=April 2012}}

Many [[List of Muslim-majority countries|Muslim-majority countries]] have constitutionally established Islam, or a specific form of it, as a state religion. [[Proselytism]] (converting people to another religion) is often illegal.

====Islam (non-denominational)====
{{main article|Non-denominational Muslim}}

===Status of religion in Israel===
{{See also|Jewish state}}
[[Israel]] is defined in several of its laws as a "[[Jewish and democratic state]]" (''medina yehudit ve-demokratit''). However, the term "[[Jew]]ish" is a [[Polysemy|polyseme]] that can describe the Jewish people [[Who is a Jew?|as either an ethnic or a religious group]]. The debate about the meaning of the term "Jewish" and its legal and social applications is one of the most profound issues with which Israeli society deals. The problem of the status of religion in Israel, even though it is relevant to all religions, usually refers to the status of [[Judaism]] in Israeli society. Thus, even though from a constitutional point of view Judaism is not the state religion in Israel, its status nevertheless determines relations between religion and state and the extent to which religion influences the political center.&lt;ref&gt;Trouble in Utopia: The Overburdened Polity of Israel, by Dan Horowitz and Moshe Lissak, p51-52&lt;/ref&gt;

The State of Israel supports religious institutions, particularly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] ones, and recognizes the "religious communities" as carried over from those recognized under the British Mandate - in turn derived from the pre-1917 Ottoman system of [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)| Millets]]. These are: Jewish and Christian (Eastern Orthodox, Latin [Catholic], Gregorian-Armenian, Armenian-Catholic, Syrian [Catholic], Chaldean [Uniate], Greek Catholic Melkite, Maronite, and Syrian Orthodox). The fact that the Muslim population was not defined as a religious community is a vestige of the Ottoman period{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} during which Islam was the dominant religion and does not affect the rights of the Muslim community to practice their faith. At the end of the period covered by the 2009 U.S. International Religious Freedom Report, several of these denominations were pending official government recognition; however, the Government has allowed adherents of not officially recognized groups freedom to practice. In 1961, legislation gave Muslim Shari'a courts exclusive jurisdiction in matters of personal status. Three additional religious communities have subsequently been recognized by Israeli law: the [[Druze]] (prior under Islamic jurisdiction), the Evangelical Episcopal Church, and the [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127349.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2009 : Israel and the occupied territories], U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.&lt;/ref&gt; These groups have their own religious courts as official state courts for personal status matters (see [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]]).

The structure and goals of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]] are governed by Israeli law, but the law does not say explicitly that it is a state Rabbinate. However, outspoken Israeli secularists such as [[Shulamit Aloni]] and [[Uri Avnery]] have long maintained that it is that in practice. Non-recognition of other streams of Judaism such as [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Conservative Judaism]] is the cause of some controversy; rabbis belonging to these currents are not recognized as such by state institutions and marriages performed by them are not recognized as valid. As pointed out by Avnery and Aloni, the essential problem is that Israel carries on the top-down Ottoman [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)| Millet]] system, under which the government reserves the complete discretion of recognizing some religions groups and not recognizing others. {{As of|2015}} [[marriage in Israel]] provides no provision for [[civil marriage]], marriage between people of different religions, marriages by people who do not belong to one of nine recognised religious communities, or [[same-sex marriage]]s, although there is recognition of marriages performed abroad.

===Political religions===
In some countries, there is a [[List of political ideologies|political ideology]] sponsored by the government that may be called [[political religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gentile |first=Emilio |year=2006 |origyear=2001 |title=Le religioni della politica.

* {{Flag|North Korea}}: the North Korean government has promulgated [[Juche]] as a political alternative to traditional religion. The doctrine advocates a strong nationalist propaganda basis and is fundamentally opposed to [[Christianity]] and [[Buddhism]], the two largest religions on the Korean peninsula. Juche theoreticians have, however, incorporated religious ideas into the state ideology.  According to government figures, Juche is the largest political religion in [[North Korea]]. The public practice of all other religions is overseen and subject to heavy surveillance by the state.

===Additional notes===
* {{flag|Indonesia}} does not declare or designate a state religion. However, [[Government of Indonesia|the government]] does only recognize 6 religions: [[Islam]], [[Protestantism]], [[Catholicism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Confucianism]]. The [[Constitution of Indonesia]] guarantees the freedom of religion and the practice of other religions and beliefs, including the [[Animism|animistic]] indigenous ones, is not prohibited by any laws. Indonesians practicing traditional polytheistic and animistic beliefs are often counted as "Hindu" for government purposes.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} [[Atheism]] or [[agnosticism]], although not prosecuted, is discouraged by the state ideology of [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]]. In addition, the province of [[Aceh]] receives a special status and a higher degree of autonomy, in which it may enact laws ([[Qanun (law)|qanuns]]) based on the [[Sharia]] and enforce it, especially to its [[Muslim]] residents.

== Former state religions ==

===Pre-modern era===

====Egypt and Sumer====
{{see also|History of religion}}

The concept of state religions was known as long ago as the empires of [[Egypt]] and [[Sumer]], when every city state or people had its own god or gods. Many of the early Sumerian rulers were priests of their patron city god. Some of the earliest semi-mythological kings may have passed into the pantheon, like [[Dumuzid the Shepherd|Dumuzid]], and some later kings came to be viewed as divine soon after their reigns, like [[Sargon the Great]] of [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]. One of the first rulers to be proclaimed a god during his actual reign was [[Gudea]] of [[Lagash]], followed by some later kings of [[Ur]], such as [[Shulgi]]. Often, the state religion was integral to the power base of the reigning government, such as in Egypt, where Pharaohs were often thought of as embodiments of the god Horus.

====Sassanid Empire====
[[Zoroastrianism]] was the state religion of the [[Sassanid dynasty]] which lasted until 651, when Persia was conquered by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]]. However, it persisted as the state religion of the independent state of [[Hyrcania]] until the 15th century.

The tiny kingdom of [[Adiabene]] in [[northern Mesopotamia]] converted to [[Judaism]] around 34&amp;nbsp;CE.

====Greek city-states====
Many of the Greek city-states also had a god or goddess associated with that city. This would not be its only god/dess, but the one that received special honors. In ancient Greece, the city of [[Athens]] had [[Athena]], [[Sparta]] had [[Ares]], [[Delphi]] had [[Apollo]] and [[Artemis]], [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] had [[Zeus]], [[Corinth]] had [[Poseidon]] and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] had [[Demeter]].

====Roman religion and Christianity====
In Rome, the office of ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'' came to be reserved for the Emperor, who was often [[Apotheosis|declared a god]] posthumously, or sometimes during his reign. Failure to worship the Emperor as a god was at times punishable by death, as the Roman government sought to link emperor worship with loyalty to the Empire. Many Christians and Jews were subject to persecution, torture and death in the Roman Empire, because it was against their beliefs to worship the Emperor.

In 311, Emperor [[Galerius]], on his deathbed, declared a religious indulgence to Christians throughout the Roman Empire, focusing on the ending of anti-Christian persecution. [[Constantine I]] and [[Licinius]], the two ''Augusti'', by the [[Edict of Milan]] of 313, enacted a law allowing religious freedom to everyone within the Roman Empire. Furthermore, the Edict of Milan cited that Christians may openly practice their religion unmolested and unrestricted, and provided that properties taken from Christians be returned to them unconditionally. Although the Edict of Milan allowed religious freedom throughout the Empire, it did not abolish nor disestablish the Roman state cult (Roman polytheistic paganism). The Edict of Milan was written in such a way as to implore the blessings of the deity.

Constantine called up the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, although he was not a baptised Christian until years later. Despite enjoying considerable popular support, Christianity was still not the official state religion in Rome, although it was in some neighboring states such as [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]], [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]], and [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]].

[[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman Religion]] ([[Neoplatonic]] [[Religion in ancient Greece|Hellenism]]) was restored for a time by [[Julian the Apostate]] from 361 to 363. Julian does not appear to have reinstated the persecutions of the earlier [[Roman emperors]].

[[Catholic]] Christianity, as opposed to Arianism and other ideologies deemed heretical, was declared to be the [[State church of the Roman Empire|state religion of the Roman Empire]] on 27 February 380&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Theodosian Code |url=http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/latinlibrary/theod.html |work=THE LATIN LIBRARY at Ad Fontes Academy|publisher=Ad Fontes Academy |accessdate=2006-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the decree ''De Fide Catolica'' of Emperor [[Theodosius I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theodosian Code XVI.i.2 |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/theodcodeXVI.html |work=Medieval Sourcebook: Banning of Other Religions |first=Paul |last=Halsall |date=June 1997 |publisher=Fordham University |accessdate=2006-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Han dynasty Confucianism====
In China, the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC – 220 AD) advocated [[Confucianism]] as the ''de facto'' state religion, establishing tests based on Confucian texts as an entrance requirement into government service—although, in fact, the "Confucianism" advocated by the Han emperors may be more properly termed a sort of Confucian [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] or "State Confucianism". This sort of Confucianism continued to be regarded by the emperors, with a few notable exceptions, as a form of state religion from this time until the overthrow of the imperial system of government in 1911.  Note however, there is a debate over whether Confucianism (including Neo-confucianism) is a religion or purely a philosophical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Confucian Religiosity: A Partial Bibliography  |url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln471/Confucian%20religiosity%20bib.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yuan dynasty Buddhism====
During the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271 – 1368 AD), [[Tibetan Buddhism]] was established as the ''de facto'' state religion by the Mongol ruler [[Kublai Khan]], the founder of the Yuan dynasty. The top-level department and government agency known as the [[Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs]] (Xuanzheng Yuan) was set up in [[Khanbaliq]] (modern [[Beijing]]) to supervise [[Buddhist monk]]s throughout the empire. Since Kublai Khan only esteemed the [[Sakya]] sect of Tibetan Buddhism, other religions became less important. Before the end of the Yuan dynasty, 14 leader of the Sakya sect had held the post of [[Imperial Preceptor]] (Dishi), thereby enjoy special power.&lt;ref&gt;History of civilizations of Central Asia.: A.D. 750 to the end of the fifteenth century. Part two : The achievements, p59&lt;/ref&gt;

====Golden Horde and Ilkhanate====
[[Shamanism]] and [[Buddhism]] were once the dominant religions among the ruling class of the Mongol khanates of [[Golden Horde]] and [[Ilkhanate]], the two western khanates of the [[Mongol Empire]]. In the early days, the rulers of both khanates increasingly adopted [[Tibetan Buddhism]], similar to the Yuan dynasty at that time. However, the Mongol rulers [[Ghazan]] of Ilkhanate and [[Öz Beg Khan|Uzbeg]] of Golden Horde converted to [[Islam]] in 1295 AD because of the Muslim Mongol emir [[Nawrūz (Mongol emir)|Nawruz]] and in 1313 AD because of [[Sufi]] [[Bukhara]]n [[sayyid]] and [[sheikh]] [[Ibn Abdul Hamid]] respectively. Their official favoring of Islam as the state religion coincided with a marked attempt to bring the regime closer to the non-Mongol majority of the regions they ruled. In Ilkhanate, [[Christian]] and [[Jewish]] subjects lost their equal status with Muslims and again had to pay the poll tax; [[Buddhists]] had the starker choice of conversion or expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;''Medieval Persia 1040–1797'', [[David Morgan (historian)|David Morgan]] p.72&lt;/ref&gt; In Golden Horde, Buddhism and Shamanism among the Mongols were proscribed, and by 1315, Uzbeg had successfully Islamicized the Horde, killing Jochid princes and Buddhist [[lama]]s who opposed his religious policy and succession of the throne.

===Modern era===
{{Globalize|article|North America|date=August 2015}}

====Europe====
* {{Flag|Netherlands}}: Article 133 of the 1814 [[Constitution of the Netherlands|Constitution]] stipulated the [[King of the Netherlands|Sovereign Prince]] should be a member of the [[Dutch Reformed Church|Reformed Church]]; this provision was dropped in the 1815 Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.denederlandsegrondwet.nl/9353000/1/j9vvihlf299q0sr/vi6ei64fdgg2&lt;/ref&gt; The 1815 Constitution also provided for a state salary and pension for the priesthood of established religions at the time (Protestantism, Catholicism and Judaism). This settlement, nicknamed ''de zilveren koorde'' (the silver cord), was abolished in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.denederlandsegrondwet.nl/9353000/1/j9vvihlf299q0sr/vi6jejckwezy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/14622151/Deontknopingvandezilverenkoorde21.pdf!null&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0003640/1994-01-01&lt;/ref&gt;

====Former state churches in British North America====

=====Protestant colonies=====
* The colonies of [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]], [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Massachusetts Bay]], [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]], [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]], and [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] were founded by [[Puritan]] Calvinist Protestants.
* The colonies of [[Province of New York|New York]], [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], [[Province of North Carolina|North Carolina]], [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]], and [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] maintained the [[Church of England]] as the established church.
* The [[Colony of Maryland]] was founded by a charter granted in 1632 to George Calvert, secretary of state to Charles I, and his son Cecil, both recent converts to Roman Catholicism. Under their leadership many English Catholic gentry families settled in Maryland. However, the colonial government was officially neutral in religious affairs, granting toleration to all Christian groups and enjoining them to avoid actions which antagonized the others. On several occasions, low-church dissenters led insurrections which temporarily overthrew the Calvert rule. In 1689, when William and Mary [[Glorious Revolution|came to the English throne]], they acceded to demands to revoke the original royal charter. In 1701, the Church of England was proclaimed, and in the course of the 18th century Maryland Catholics were first barred from public office, then disenfranchised, although not all of the laws passed against them (notably laws restricting property rights and imposing penalties for sending children to be educated in foreign Catholic institutions) were enforced, and some Catholics even continued to hold public office.

=====Catholic colonies=====
* When [[New France]] was transferred to [[Great Britain]] in 1763, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] remained under toleration, but [[Huguenot]]s were allowed entrance where they had formerly been banned from settlement by Parisian authorities.
* When [[Spanish Florida]] was ceded to [[Great Britain]] in 1763, the British divided Florida into two colonies, East and West Florida, which both continued a policy of toleration for the Catholic residents.

=====Colonies with no established church=====
* The [[Province of Pennsylvania]] was founded by [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], but the colony never had an established church.
* The [[Province of New Jersey]], without official religion, had a significant [[Quaker]] lobby, but Calvinists of all types also had a presence.
* [[Delaware Colony]] had no established church, but was contested between Catholics and Quakers.
* The [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]], founded by religious dissenters forced to flee the Massachusetts Bay colony, is widely regarded as the first polity to grant religious freedom to all its citizens, although Catholics were barred intermittently. Baptists, Seekers/Quakers and Jews made this colony their home.  The [[Rhode Island Royal Charter|King Charles Charter]] of 1663 guaranteed "full liberty in religious concernments".

====Non-British colonies====
These areas were disestablished and dissolved, yet their presences were tolerated by the English and later British colonial governments, as [[Foreign Protestants]], whose communities were expected to observe their own ways without causing controversy or conflict for the prevalent colonists. After the Revolution, their ethno-religious backgrounds were chiefly sought as the most compatible non-British Isles immigrants.

* [[New Netherland]] was founded by [[Dutch Reformed]] Calvinists.
* [[New Sweden]] was founded by [[Church of Sweden]] Lutherans.

====State of Deseret====
The [[State of Deseret]] was a provisional [[US State|state]] of the [[United States]], proposed in 1849, by [[Mormon]] settlers in [[Salt Lake City]]. The provisional state existed for slightly over two years, but attempts to gain recognition by the United States government foundered for various reasons. The [[Utah Territory]] which was then founded was under Mormon control, and repeated attempts to gain statehood met resistance, in part due to concerns over the principle of separation of church and state conflicting with the practice of members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] of placing their highest value on "following counsel" in virtually all matters relating to their church-centered lives. The state of [[Utah]] was eventually admitted to the union on 4 January 1896, after the various issues had been resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/statehood_and_the_progressive_era/struggleforstatehood.html Struggle For Statehood] [[Edward Leo Lyman]], ''Utah History Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]], ratified in 1868, makes no mention of religious establishment, but forbids the states to "abridge the privileges or immunities" of U.S. citizens, or to "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law". In the 1947 case of [[Everson v. Board of Education]], the United States Supreme Court held that this later provision [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporates]] the First Amendment's Establishment Clause as applying to the States, and thereby prohibits state and local religious establishments. The exact boundaries of this prohibition are still disputed, and are a frequent source of cases before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] — especially as the Court must now balance, on a state level, the First Amendment prohibitions on government establishment of official religions with the First Amendment prohibitions on government interference with the free exercise of religion. See [[school prayer]] for such a controversy in contemporary American politics.

All current State constitutions do mention a Creator, but include guarantees of religious liberty parallel to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. The constitutions of eight states ([[Arkansas]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[North Carolina]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[South Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Texas]]) also contain clauses that prohibit atheists from holding public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.godlessgeeks.com/LINKS/StateConstitutions.htm |title=State Constitutions that Discriminate Against Atheists |publisher=www.godlessgeeks.com |accessdate=2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/texas.htm

Watkins]]'', where the court ruled unanimously that such clauses constituted a religious test incompatible with the religious test prohibition in [[no religious test clause|Article 6 Section 3]] of the United States Constitution.
