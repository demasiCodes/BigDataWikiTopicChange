A '''state religion''' (also called an '''established religion''', '''state church''', '''established church''', or '''official religion''') is a [[religion|religious]] body or [[creed]] officially endorsed by the [[Sovereign state|state]]. A state with an official religion, while not [[secular state|secular]], is not necessarily a [[theocracy]].

The term ''state church'' is associated with [[Christianity]], historically the [[state church of the Roman Empire]], and is sometimes used to denote a specific modern national branch of Christianity. Closely related to state churches are what [[sociology|sociologists]] call [[ecclesia (sociology of religion)|ecclesiae]], though the two are slightly different.

State religions are official or government-sanctioned establishments of a religion, but neither does the state need be under the control of the church (as in a theocracy), nor is the state-sanctioned church necessarily under the control of the state.

The institution of state-sponsored religious cults is ancient, reaching into the [[Ancient Near East]] and prehistory. The relation of religious cult and the state was discussed by [[Varro]], under the term of ''[[theologia civilis]]'' ("civic theology"). The first state-sponsored [[Christian church]] was the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], established in 301 AD.&lt;ref&gt;

== Types of state religion ==

The degree and nature of state backing for denomination or creed designated as a state religion can vary. It can range from mere endorsement (with or without financial support) with freedom for other faiths to practice, to prohibiting any competing religious body from operating and to persecuting the followers of other sects. In Europe, competition between Catholic and Protestant denominations for state sponsorship in the 16th century evolved the principle ''[[cuius regio eius religio]]'' ("states follow the religion of the ruler") embodied in the text of the [[treaty]] that marked the [[Peace of Augsburg]], 1555. In England, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] broke with Rome in 1534, being declared the "Supreme Head on earth of the Church of England",&lt;ref&gt;The headship was administrative and jurisdictional but did not include the ''potestas ordinis'' (the right to preach, ordain, administer the sacraments and rites of the Church which were reserved to the clergy) &amp;ndash;Bray, Gerald. ''Documents of the English Reformation'' James Clarke &amp; Cº(1994), p.114&lt;/ref&gt; the official religion of England continued to be "Catholicism without the Pope" until after his death in 1547,&lt;ref&gt;Neill, Stephen. ''Anglicanism'' Penguin (1960), p.61&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[Scotland]] the [[Church of Scotland]] opposed the religion of the ruler.

In some cases, an administrative region may sponsor and fund a set of religious denominations; such is the case in [[Alsace-Moselle]] in [[France]] under its [[Local law in Alsace-Moselle|local law]], following the pre-1905 French concordatry legal system and patterns in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;The concerned religious communities are the [[Diocese of Metz|dioceses of Metz]] and [[Archdiocese of Strasbourg|of Strasbourg]], the Lutheran [[EPCAAL]] and the Reformed [[EPRAL]] and the three [[Consistory (Judaism)|Israelite consistories]] in Colmar, Metz and Strasbourg.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[communist state]]s, notably in [[Religion in North Korea|North Korea]] and [[Religion in Cuba|Cuba]], the state sponsors religious organizations, and activities outside those state-sponsored religious organizations are met with various degrees of official disapproval. In these cases, state religions are widely seen as efforts by the state to prevent alternate sources of authority.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===State churches===
There is also a difference between a "state church" and the broader term of "state religion". A "state church" is a state religion created by a state for use exclusively by that state. An example of a "state religion" that's not also a "state church", is [[Roman Catholicism]] in [[Costa Rica]] which was accepted as the state religion in the 1949 Constitution, despite the lack of a national church. In the case of a "state church", the state has absolute control over the church, but in the case of a "state religion", the church is ruled by an exterior body (in the case of Catholicism, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] has control over the church). In either case, the official state religion has some influence over the ruling of the state. As of 2012, there are only seven state churches left, as most countries which once featured state churches have separated the church from their government.

===Disestablishment===
&lt;!---This section is linked from [[Liberal Party (UK)]]---&gt;
{{further|Secular state}}
Disestablishment is the process of repealing a church's status as an organ of the state. Opponents of disestablishment are known as [[Antidisestablishmentarianism|antidisestablishmentarians]].

== Current state religions ==

Currently, the following religions have been established as state religions in some countries. All are versions of [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] or [[Buddhism]].

===Christian countries===
The following states recognize some form of [[Christianity]] as their state or official religion (by denomination):

====Roman Catholicism====
Jurisdictions where [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] has been established as a state or official religion:

* [[Argentina]]: article 2 of the [[constitution of Argentina]] explicitly states that the government supports the Catholic Church. However, the constitution does not establish a state religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sitiosargentina.com.ar/2/CONSTITUCION_NACIONAL_ARGENTINA.htm Preable: First part, section 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.argentina.gob.ar/pais/56-religion.php]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Costa Rica]]: article 75 of the constitution of Costa Rica confirms that ''"The Roman Catholic and Apostolic Religion is the religion of the State, which contributes to its maintenance, without preventing the free exercise in the Republic of other forms of worship that are not opposed to universal morality or good customs."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.costaricalaw.com/Constitutional-Law/costa-rica-constitution-in-english.html Costa Rica Constitution in English TITLE VI: RELIGION]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Liechtenstein]]: the [[constitution of Liechtenstein]] describes the Catholic Church as the state religion and enjoying ''"the full protection of the State"''. The constitution does however ensure that people of other faiths ''"shall be entitled to practise their creeds and to hold religious services to the extent consistent with morality and public order."''&lt;ref name=LiechtensteinConstitution&gt;{{Wayback |date=20090326162534 |url=http://www.liechtenstein.li/en/pdf-fl-staat-verfassung-sept2003.pdf |title=Constitution  Religion }} (archived from [http://www.liechtenstein.li/en/pdf-fl-staat-verfassung-sept2003.pdf the original] on 2009-03-26).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Malta]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mjha.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lom&amp;itemid=8566|title=Constitution of Malta (Article 2)|publisher=[http://www.mjha.gov.mt mjha.gov.mt]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Monaco]]: article 9 of the [[constitution of Monaco]] describes ''"La religion catholique, apostolique et romaine'' [the catholic, [[apostolic]] and Roman religion]" as the religion of the state.&lt;ref name=MonacoReligion&gt;{{Wayback |date=20110927091747 |url=http://www.gouv.mc/devwww/wwwnew.nsf/1909$/036c62fe5f92f2efc1256f5b0054fa42gb?OpenDocument&amp;3Gb |title=CONSTITUTION DE LA PRINCIPAUTE }} (French): Art. 9., Principaute De Monaco: Ministère d'Etat (archived from [http://www.gouv.mc/devwww/wwwnew.nsf/1909$/036c62fe5f92f2efc1256f5b0054fa42gb?OpenDocument&amp;3Gb the original] on 2011-09-27).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vatican City]]: the Vatican is an [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] or [[Sacerdotal state|sacerdotal]]-[[Monarchy|monarchical]]&lt;ref name=pages&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-pages.com/vatican/vatican_city.asp |title=Vatican City |publisher=Catholic-Pages.com |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; state ruled by the [[Pope]], who is also the head of the Catholic Church. The highest state functionaries are all [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] clergy of various national origins. It is the sovereign territory of the [[Holy See]] ({{lang-la|Sancta Sedes}}) and the location of the Pope's official residence, referred to as the [[Apostolic Palace]].

The above listed countries also give constitutional privileges to Roman Catholicism without necessarily referring to it as the state religion.

====Eastern Orthodoxy====
*[[Greece]]: [[Church of Greece]]&lt;ref name=GreeceConstitution&gt;[http://www.hri.org/docs/syntagma/artcl25.html#A3 THE CONSTITUTION OF GREECE ]: SECTION II RELATIONS OF CHURCH AND STATE, [http://www.hri.org/ Hellenic Resources network].&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]: [[Georgian Orthodox Church]] is not the state church of Georgia but has a special constitutional agreement with the state, with the constitution recognising ''"the special role of the Apostle Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Georgia in the history of Georgia and its independence from the state."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.ge/en/kanonmdebloba/constitution-of-georgia-68 Constitution of Georgia] Article 9(1&amp;2) and 73(1a{{sup|1}})&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Concordat of 2002]])

====Protestantism====

=====Anglicanism=====
*[[England]]: the [[Church of England]] is the officially established religious institution &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/history/ |title=The History of the Church of England |publisher=The Archbishops' Council of the Church of England|accessdate=2006-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[England]], and also the [[Mother Church]] of the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]]. It is the only established Anglican Church. The [[British monarchy|British monarch]] is the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]] and is [[Defender of the Faith]].  In 19th century England there was a campaign by [[The Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]], [[dissenter]]s and [[nonconformists]] to disestablish the Church of England, even when most of its privileges had been removed by Parliament. The campaigners styled themselves "Liberationists" (the "Liberation Society" was founded by [[Edward Miall]] in 1853). Though their campaign failed, nearly all of the legal disabilities of nonconformists were gradually dismantled. The campaign for disestablishment was revived in the 20th century when Parliament rejected the 1929 revision of the [[Book of Common Prayer]], leading to calls for separation of Church and State to prevent political interference in matters of [[worship]].

:[[Lords Spiritual]], who are the 26 most senior Archbishops and Bishops in the [[Church of England|Church]] are reserved seats in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in the [[House of Lords]]. The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Archbishop of York]], [[Bishop of London]], [[Bishop of Durham]], and the [[Bishop of Winchester]] sit automatically with the 21 longest-serving Bishops.

=====Lutheranism=====
Jurisdictions where a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church has been established as a state religion include the [[Nordic countries]]. Membership is very high among the general population, however the amount of actively participating members and believers is considerably lower than in many other countries with similar membership statistics. Furthermore, all of these churches have lately seen decline in the percentage of the population being members.

*[[Denmark]]: section 4 of the Danish constitution confirms the [[Church of Denmark]] as the state church.&lt;ref name=DenmarkConstitution&gt;[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/da00000_.html Denmark – Constitution]: Section 4 State Church, [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/ International Constitutional Law].&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Faroe Islands]]: the [[Church of the Faroe Islands]] is the state church of the [[Faroe Islands]], a territory of Denmark.
*[[Iceland]]: the [[Constitution of Iceland|Icelandic constitution]] confirms [[Church of Iceland]] as the state church of Iceland.&lt;ref name=IcelandConstitution&gt;[http://www.government.is/constitution/ Constitution of the Republic of Iceland]: Article 62, [http://www.government.is/ Government of Iceland].&lt;/ref&gt; (76.81% of population members at 1 January 2012) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statice.is/?PageID=1180&amp;src=/temp_en/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=MAN10001%26ti=Populations+by+religious+organizations+1990-2009++%26path=../Database/mannfjoldi/Trufelog/%26lang=1%26units=Number |title=Statistics Iceland - Statistics » Population » Religious organisations |publisher=Statice.is |year=2011 |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Norway]]: the [[Constitution of Norway]] describes the [[Church of Norway]] as ''"an Evangelical-Lutheran church ... Norway's people's church, and is supported by the State as such."'' This was amended in 2012 from ''"Evangelical-Lutheran religion remains the public religion of the State"''&lt;ref name="abcnyheter"&gt;[http://www.abcnyheter.no/nyheter/080410/losere-band-men-fortsatt-statskirke Løsere bånd, men fortsatt statskirke], ABC Nyheter&lt;!-- http://www.webcitation.org/6DEb3MkkC --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/norge/1.8076910 Staten skal ikke lenger ansette biskoper], NRK&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fritanke.no/index.php?page=vis_nyhet&amp;NyhetID=8840 Slik blir den nye statskirkeordningen]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Finland]]: the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]] has a special relationship with the Finnish state, its internal structure being described in a special law, the Church Act.&lt;ref name=FinlandConstitution&gt;[http://servat.unibe.ch/icl/fi00000_.html Finland – Constitution], Section 76 The Church Act, http://servat.unibe.ch/icl/fi00000_.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The Church Act can be amended only by a decision of the synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church and subsequent ratification by the [[Parliament of Finland]]. The Church Act is protected by the [[Constitution of Finland|Finnish Constitution]] and the state can not change the Church Act without changing the constitution. The church has a power to tax its members and all corporations unless a majority of shareholders are members of the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]]. The state collects these taxes for the church, for a fee. On the other hand, the church is required to give a burial place for everyone in its graveyards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eroakirkosta.fi/media/english/status_of_the_finnish_state_church_in_2007.html#privileges |title=Status of the Finnish State Church in 2007—Privileges of the State Church |date=7 October 2007 |publisher=eroakirkosta.fi |accessdate=2007-10-23 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (77.2% of population members at the end of 2011).&lt;ref&gt;[http://evl.fi/EVLUutiset.nsf/Documents/16643791F3A298B5C22579A0003B1059?OpenDocument&amp;lang=EN 77.2 percent of Finns belong to the Lutheran church] evl.fi 10.2.2012&lt;/ref&gt; The [[President of the Republic of Finland]] also decides the themes for intercession days. The church does not consider itself a state church, as the Finnish state does not have the power to influence its internal workings or its theology, although it has a veto in those changes of the internal structure which require changing the Church Act. Neither does the Finnish state accord any precedence to Lutherans or the Lutheran faith in its own acts.
*[[Sweden]]: the [[Church of Sweden]], previously the national state church, is now described as ''"[[national church]]"''. In late 2011 the Church of Sweden had 68.8% of the population as its members. Memberships are high because until 1996 membership was automatic for children of members. Since 1996, [[baptism]] is the basis for membership.&lt;ref name="Church of Sweden statistics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/default.aspx?id=100243&amp;did=246080 |title=Medlemmar 1972-2008, tabell och diagram |format=XLS, 22.5&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]] |language=Swedish |publisher=Svenska kyrkan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Reformed=====
*[[Tuvalu]]: [[Church of Tuvalu]]
*[[Scotland]]: [[Church of Scotland]] is recognized as the national church of [[Scotland]], but is not a state church and thus differs from the [[Church of England]]. Its constitution, which is recognised by acts of the British Parliament, gives it complete independence from the state in spiritual matters.

====Other====
*[[France]]: the [[Local law in Alsace-Moselle|Concordat in Alsace-Moselle]] is a law relating to the official status accorded to certain religions in these territories. This Concordat is a remnant of the Napoleonic [[Concordat of 1801]].  The 1801 Concordat was abrogated in the rest of France by the [[1905 French law on the separation of Church and State|law of 1905]] on the [[separation of church and state]].  However, at the time, Alsace-Moselle had been [[Alsace-Lorraine|annexed by Germany]], so the Concordat remained in force in these areas. The Concordat recognises four religious traditions in Alsace-Moselle: the Jewish religion and three branches of Christianity: Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed. Therefore the separation of church, the French concept of [[Laïcité]], does not apply in this region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Church-state tie opens door for mosque

===Israel===
*[[Israel]]: Israel is defined in several of its laws as a "[[Jewish and democratic state]]" (''medina yehudit ve-demokratit''). However, the term "[[Jew]]ish" is a [[Polysemy|polyseme]] that can describe the Jewish people [[Who is a Jew?|as both an ethnic or a religious group]]. The debate about the meaning of the term "Jewish" and its legal and social applications is one of the most profound issues with which Israeli society deals.

:The State of Israel supports religious institutions, particularly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] ones, and recognizes the "religious communities" as carried over from those recognized under the British Mandate. These are: Jewish and Christian (Eastern Orthodox, Latin [Catholic], Gregorian-Armenian, Armenian-Catholic, Syrian [Catholic], Chaldean [Uniate], Greek Catholic Melkite, Maronite, and Syrian Orthodox). The fact that the Muslim population was not defined as a religious community is a vestige of the Ottoman period{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} during which Islam was the dominant religion and does not affect the rights of the Muslim community to practice their faith. At the end of the period covered by the 2009 U.S. International Religious Freedom Report, several of these denominations were pending official government recognition; however, the Government has allowed adherents of not officially recognized groups freedom to practice. In 1961, legislation gave Muslim Shari'a courts exclusive jurisdiction in matters of personal status. Three additional religious communities have subsequently been recognized by Israeli law: the [[Druze]] (prior under Islamic jurisdiction), the Evangelical Episcopal Church, and the [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127349.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2009 : Israel and the occupied territories], U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.&lt;/ref&gt; These groups have their own religious courts as official state courts for personal status matters (see [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]]).

:The structure and goals of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]] are governed by Israeli law, but the law does not say explicitly that it is a state Rabbinate. However, outspoken Israeli secularists such as [[Shulamit Aloni]] and [[Uri Avnery]] have long maintained that it is that in practice. Non-recognition of other streams of Judaism such as [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Conservative Judaism]] is the cause of some controversy; rabbis belonging to these currents are not recognized as such by state institutions and marriages performed by them are not recognized as valid. {{As of|2011}} [[marriage in Israel]] provides no provision for [[civil marriage]], marriage between people of different religions, marriages by people who do not belong to one of nine recognised religious communities, or [[same-sex marriage]]s, although there is recognition of marriages performed abroad.

===Political religions===
In some countries, there is a [[List of political ideologies|political ideology]] sponsored by the government that may be called [[political religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gentile |first=Emilio |year=2006 |origyear=2001 |title=Le religioni della politica.

*[[North Korea]]: the North Korean government has promulgated [[Juche]] as a political alternative to traditional religion. The doctrine advocates a strong nationalist propaganda basis and is fundamentally opposed to [[Christianity]] and [[Buddhism]], the two largest religions on the Korean peninsula. Juche theoreticians have, however, incorporated religious ideas into the state ideology.  According to government figures, Juche is the largest political religion in [[North Korea]]. The public practice of all other religions is overseen and subject to heavy surveillance by the state.

===Additional notes===
* [[Indonesia]] does not declare or designate a state religion. However, [[Government of Indonesia|the government]] does only recognize 6 religions: [[Islam]], [[Protestantism]], [[Catholicism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Confucianism]]. The [[Constitution of Indonesia]] guarantees the freedom of religion and the practice of other religions and beliefs, including the [[Animism|animistic]] indigenous ones, is not prohibited by any laws. Indonesians practicing traditional polytheistic and animistic beliefs are often counted as "Hindu" for government purposes.{{cn|date=October 2014}} [[Atheism]] or [[agnosticism]], although not prosecuted, is discouraged by the state ideology of [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]]. In addition, the province of [[Aceh]] receives a special status and a higher degree of autonomy, in which it may enact laws ([[Qanun (law)|qanuns]]) based on the [[Sharia]] and enforce it, especially to its [[Muslim]] residents.
* [[Nepal]] was once the world's only Hindu state, but has ceased to be so following a declaration by the Parliament in 2006.

* Many countries indirectly fund the activities of different religious denominations by granting tax-exempt status to churches and religious institutions which qualify as [[charitable organization]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1828.pdf |format=PDF |title=Tax guide for churches and Religious Institutions |accessdate=2006-11-23 |author=Internal Revenue Service |publisher=United States Department of the Treasury}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irs.gov/charities/charitable/article/0,,id=96099,00.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120920210815/http://www.irs.gov/Charities-&amp;-Non-Profits/Charitable-Organizations/Exemption-Requirements---Section-501(c)(3)-Organizations |archivedate=2012-09-20 |title=Exemption Requirements |accessdate=2006-11-23 |author=Internal Revenue Seervice |publisher=United States Department of the Treasury}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these religions are not established as state religions.

==Former state religions ==

===Ancient===

====Egypt and Sumer====
{{see also|History of religion}}
The concept of state religions was known as long ago as the empires of [[Egypt]] and [[Sumer]], when every city state or people had its own god or gods. Many of the early Sumerian rulers were priests of their patron city god. Some of the earliest semi-mythological kings may have passed into the pantheon, like [[Dumuzid the Shepherd|Dumuzid]], and some later kings came to be viewed as divine soon after their reigns, like [[Sargon the Great]] of [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]. One of the first rulers to be proclaimed a god during his actual reign was [[Gudea]] of [[Lagash]], followed by some later kings of [[Ur]], such as [[Shulgi]]. Often, the state religion was integral to the power base of the reigning government, such as in Egypt, where Pharaohs were often thought of as embodiments of the god Horus.

====Sassanid Empire====
[[Zoroastrianism]] was the state religion of the [[Sassanid dynasty]] which lasted until 651, when Persia was conquered by the forces of Islam. However, it persisted as the state religion of the independent state of [[Hyrcania]] until the 15th century.

The tiny kingdom of [[Adiabene]] in northern Mesopotamia converted to Judaism around 34&amp;nbsp;AD.

====Greek city-states====
Many of the Greek city-states also had a god or goddess associated with that city. This would not be its only god/dess, but the one that received special honors. In ancient Greece, the city of [[Athens]] had [[Athena]], [[Sparta]] had [[Ares]], [[Delphi]] had [[Apollo]] and [[Artemis]], [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] had [[Zeus]], [[Corinth]] had [[Poseidon]] and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] had [[Demeter]].

====Roman religion and Christianity====
In Rome, the office of ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'' came to be reserved for the Emperor, who was often [[Apotheosis|declared a god]] posthumously, or sometimes during his reign. Failure to worship the Emperor as a god was at times punishable by death, as the Roman government sought to link emperor worship with loyalty to the Empire. Many Christians and Jews were subject to persecution, torture and death in the Roman Empire, because it was against their beliefs to worship the Emperor.

In 311, Emperor [[Galerius]], on his deathbed, declared a religious indulgence to Christians throughout the Roman Empire, focusing on the ending of anti-Christian persecution. [[Constantine I]] and [[Licinius]], the two ''Augusti'', by the [[Edict of Milan]] of 313, enacted a law allowing religious freedom to everyone within the Roman Empire. Furthermore, the Edict of Milan cited that Christians may openly practice their religion unmolested and unrestricted, and provided that properties taken from Christians be returned to them unconditionally. Although the Edict of Milan allowed religious freedom throughout the Empire, it did not abolish nor disestablish the Roman state cult (Roman polytheistic paganism). The Edict of Milan was written in such a way as to implore the blessings of the deity.

Constantine called up the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, although he was not a baptised Christian until years later. Despite enjoying considerable popular support, Christianity was still not the official state religion in Rome, although it was in some neighboring states such as [[Armenia]] and [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]].

[[Roman religion (disambiguation)|Roman Religion]] ([[Neoplatonic]] [[Religion in ancient Greece|Hellenism]]) was restored for a time by [[Julian the Apostate]] from 361 to 363. Julian does not appear to have reinstated the persecutions of the earlier [[Roman emperors]].

[[Catholic]] Christianity, as opposed to Arianism and other ideologies deemed heretical, was declared to be the [[State church of the Roman Empire|state religion of the Roman Empire]] on 27 February 380&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Theodosian Code |url=http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/latinlibrary/theod.html |work=THE LATIN LIBRARY at Ad Fontes Academy|publisher=Ad Fontes Academy |accessdate=2006-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the decree ''De Fide Catolica'' of Emperor [[Theodosius I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theodosian Code XVI.i.2 |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/theodcodeXVI.html |work=Medieval Sourcebook: Banning of Other Religions |first=Paul |last=Halsall |date=June 1997 |publisher=Fordham University |accessdate=2006-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Han Dynasty Confucianism====
In China, the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC – 220 AD) advocated [[Confucianism]] as the ''de facto'' state religion, establishing tests based on Confucian texts as an entrance requirement into government service—although, in fact, the "Confucianism" advocated by the Han emperors may be more properly termed a sort of Confucian [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] or "State Confucianism". This sort of Confucianism continued to be regarded by the emperors, with a few notable exceptions, as a form of state religion from this time until the overthrow of the imperial system of government in 1911.  Note however, there is a debate over whether Confucianism (including Neo-confucianism) is a religion or purely a philosophical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Confucian Religiosity: A Partial Bibliography  |url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln471/Confucian%20religiosity%20bib.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern era ===

====Former state churches in British North America====

=====Protestant colonies=====
* The colonies of [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]], [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Massachusetts Bay]], [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]], [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]], and [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] were founded by [[Puritan]] Calvinist Protestants.
* The colonies of [[Province of New York|New York]], [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], [[Province of North Carolina|North Carolina]], [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]], and [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] were officially [[Church of England]].
* The [[Colony of Maryland]] was founded by a charter granted in 1632 to George Calvert, secretary of state to Charles I, and his son Cecil, both recent converts to Roman Catholicism. Under their leadership many English Catholic gentry families settled in Maryland. However, the colonial government was officially neutral in religious affairs, granting toleration to all Christian groups and enjoining them to avoid actions which antagonized the others. On several occasions, low-church dissenters led insurrections which temporarily overthrew the Calvert rule. In 1689, when William and Mary came to the English throne, they acceded to demands to revoke the original royal charter. In 1701, the Church of England was proclaimed, and in the course of the 18th century Maryland Catholics were first barred from public office, then disenfranchised, although not all of the laws passed against them (notably laws restricting property rights and imposing penalties for sending children to be educated in foreign Catholic institutions) were enforced, and some Catholics even continued to hold public office.

=====Catholic colonies=====
* When [[New France]] was transferred to [[Great Britain]] in 1763, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] remained under toleration, but [[Huguenot]]s were allowed entrance where they had formerly been banned from settlement by Parisian authorities.
* [[Spanish Florida]] was ceded to [[Great Britain]] in 1763, the British divided Florida into two colonies. Both East and West Florida continued a policy of toleration for the Catholic Residents.

=====Colonies with no established church=====
* The [[Province of Pennsylvania]] was founded by [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], but the colony never had an established church.
* The [[Province of New Jersey]], without official religion, had a significant [[Quaker]] lobby, but Calvinists of all types also had a presence.
* [[Delaware Colony]] had no established church, but was contested between Catholics and Quakers.
* The [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]], founded by religious dissenters forced to flee the Massachusetts Bay colony, is widely regarded as the first polity to grant religious freedom to all its citizens, although Catholics were barred intermittently. Baptists, Seekers/Quakers and Jews made this colony their home.

====Non-British colonies====
In both cases, these areas were disestablished and dissolved, yet their presences were tolerated by the English and later British colonial governments, as [[Foreign Protestants]], whose communities were expected to observe their own ways without causing controversy or conflict for the prevalent colonists. After the Revolution, their ethno-religious backgrounds were chiefly sought as the most compatible non-British Isles immigrants.

* [[New Netherland]] was founded by [[Dutch Reformed]] Calvinists.
* [[New Sweden]] was founded by [[Church of Sweden]] Lutherans.

====State of Deseret====
The [[State of Deseret]] was a provisional [[US State|state]] of the [[United States]], proposed in 1849 by [[Mormon]] settlers in [[Salt Lake City]]. The provisional state existed for slightly over two years, but attempts to gain recognition by the United States government foundered for various reasons. The [[Utah Territory]] which was then founded was under Mormon control, and repeated attempts to gain statehood met resistance, in part due to concerns over the principle of separation of church and state conflicting with the practice of members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] of placing their highest value on "following counsel" in virtually all matters relating to their church-centered lives. The state of [[Utah]] was eventually admitted to the union on 4 January 1896, after the various issues had been resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/statehood_and_the_progressive_era/struggleforstatehood.html Struggle For Statehood] [[Edward Leo Lyman]], ''Utah History Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]], ratified in 1868, makes no mention of religious establishment, but forbids the states to "abridge the privileges or immunities" of U.S. citizens, or to "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law". In the 1947 case of [[Everson v. Board of Education]], the United States Supreme Court held that this later provision [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporates]] the First Amendment's Establishment Clause as applying to the States, and thereby prohibits state and local religious establishments. The exact boundaries of this prohibition are still disputed, and are a frequent source of cases before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] — especially as the Court must now balance, on a state level, the First Amendment prohibitions on government establishment of official religions with the First Amendment prohibitions on government interference with the free exercise of religion. See [[school prayer]] for such a controversy in contemporary American politics.

All current State constitutions do mention a Creator, but include guarantees of religious liberty parallel to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. The constitutions of eight states ([[Arkansas]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[North Carolina]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[South Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Texas]]) also contain clauses that prohibit atheists from holding public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.godlessgeeks.com/LINKS/StateConstitutions.htm |title=State Constitutions that Discriminate Against Atheists |publisher=www.godlessgeeks.com |accessdate=2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/texas.htm

Watkins]]'', where the court ruled unanimously that such clauses constituted a religious test incompatible with the religious test prohibition in [[no religious test clause|Article 6 Section 3]] of the United States Constitution.
