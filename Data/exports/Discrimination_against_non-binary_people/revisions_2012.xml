'''[[Discrimination]] towards [[gender variant]] persons who fall outside of the [[gender binary]]''' is [[prejudice]] towards individuals who do not fit the [[gender binary]] as strictly [[male]] or [[female]]. It is a type of [[transphobia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norton|first=Jody|title="Brain Says You're a Girl, But I Think You're a Sissy Boy": Cultural Origins of Transphobia|journal=International Journal of Sexuality and Gender Studies|year=1997|volume=2, Number 2|pages=139–164|doi=10.1023/A:1026320611878|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sexism.&lt;ref name="Levesque2011"&gt;{{cite book | author = Roger J.R.

[[Cisgender]] and binary [[transgender]] people can also display prejudice against non-binary people, and there is discrimination of this sort in the transgender community much like there is transphobia in the [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and transgender ([[LGBT]]) communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Preves|first=Sharon Elaine|title=Negotiating the Constraints of Gender Binarism: Intersexuals' Challenge to Gender Categorization|journal=Current Sociology|year=2000|month=July|volume=48|issue=3|pages=27–50|doi=10.1177/0011392100048003004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A study in the ''National Transgender Discrimination Survey'' showed that genderqueer and other non-binary individuals were more likely to be unemployed (76% vs. 56%), suffer physical assaults (32% vs. 25%), experience police brutality and harassment (31% vs. 21%), and opt out of medical treatment due to discrimination (36% vs. 27%) compared to transgender individuals who identified within the gender binary (i.e., [[trans man|trans men]] and [[trans woman|trans women]]). This study also found that they were more likely to be [[people of color]] (30% vs. 23%) and younger (under 45) than binary transgender people (89% vs. 68%).&lt;ref name="Harrison2011"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jack Harrison, Jaime Grant, Jody L.
