A '''culture war''' is a form of [[cultural conflict]] (metaphorical "[[war]]") between different [[Social group|social groups]] who struggle to politically impose their own ideology (moral beliefs, humane [[virtue]]s, religious practices) upon [[Mainstream culture|mainstream society]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Diaz Ruiz |first1=Carlos |last2=Nilsson |first2=Tomas |date=2022-08-08 |title=Disinformation and Echo Chambers: How Disinformation Circulates on Social Media Through Identity-Driven Controversies |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/07439156221103852 |journal=Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing |language=en |volume=42 |pages=18–35 |doi=10.1177/07439156221103852 |issn=0743-9156 |s2cid=248934562 |access-date=September 5, 2022 |archive-date=June 20, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220620070343/https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/07439156221103852 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Koleva |first1=Spassena P. |last2=Graham |first2=Jesse |last3=Iyer |first3=Ravi |last4=Ditto |first4=Peter H. |last5=Haidt |first5=Jonathan |date=2012-04-01 |title=Tracing the threads: How five moral concerns (especially Purity) help explain culture war attitudes |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656612000074 |journal=Journal of Research in Personality |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=184–194 |doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2012.01.006 |s2cid=6786293 |issn=0092-6566}}&lt;/ref&gt; or upon the other.

==Etymology==

=== Kulturkampf ===
{{excerpt|Kulturkampf}}

In the English language, the term ''culture war'' is a [[calque]] of the German word ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' (culture struggle), which refers to an historical event in Germany.   The term appears  as the title of an 1875 British book review of a German pamphlet.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=p7nTaPXOce4C&amp;dq=%22culture+war%22&amp;pg=PA380  ''The Month and Catholic Review'' (March 1875) vol 4 p. 380]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

===Criticism and evaluation===

Since the time that James Davison Hunter first applied the concept of culture wars to American life, the idea has been subject to questions about whether "culture wars" names a real phenomenon, and if so, whether the phenomenon it describes is a cause of, or merely a result of, membership in groups like political parties and religions. Culture wars have also been subject to the criticism of being artificial, imposed, or asymmetric conflicts, rather than a result of authentic differences between cultures.

Researchers have differed about the [[Validity (statistics)|scientific validity]] of the notion of culture war. Some claim it does not describe real behavior, or that it describes only the behavior of a small political elite. Others claim culture war is real and widespread, and even that it is fundamental to explaining Americans' political behavior and beliefs.

A 2023 study on the circulation of conspiracy theories on social media noted that disinformation actors insert polarizing claims in culture wars by taking one side or the other, thus making the adherents circulate and parrot disinformation as a rhetorical ammunition against their perceived opponents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Political scientist [[Alan Wolfe]] participated in a series of scholarly debates in the 1990s and 2000s against Hunter, claiming that Hunter's concept of culture wars did not accurately describe the opinions or behavior of Americans, which Wolfe claimed were more united than polarized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hunter |first1=James Davison |last2=Wolfe |first2=Alan |date= 2006 |title=Is There a Culture War? : A Dialogue on Values and American Public Life |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |oclc=76966750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[meta-analysis]] of opinion data from 1992 to 2012 published in the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' concluded that, in contrast to a common belief that political party and religious membership shape opinion on culture war topics, instead opinions on culture war topics lead people to revise their political party and religious orientations. The researchers view culture war attitudes as "foundational elements in the political and religious belief systems of ordinary citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goren |first1=Paul |last2=Chapp |first2=Christopher |date=February 24, 2017 |title=Moral Power: How Public Opinion on Culture War Issues Shapes Partisan Predispositions and Religious Orientations |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=111 |issue=1 |pages=110–128 |doi=10.1017/S0003055416000435 |s2cid=151573922 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Artificiality or asymmetry====

Some writers and scholars have said that culture wars are created or perpetuated by political special interest groups, by reactionary social movements, by party dynamics, or by electoral politics as a whole. These authors view culture war not as an unavoidable result of widespread cultural differences, but as a technique used to create [[In-group and out-group|in-groups and out-groups]] for a political purpose.

Political commentator E. J. Dionne has written that culture war is an electoral technique to exploit differences and grievances, remarking that the real cultural division is "between those who want to have a culture war and those who don't."&lt;ref name="Dionne2006" /&gt;

Sociologist Scott Melzer says that culture wars are created by conservative, reactive organizations and movements. Members of these movements possess a "sense of victimization at the hands of a liberal culture run amok. In their eyes, immigrants, gays, women, the poor, and other groups are (undeservedly) granted special rights and privileges." Melzer writes about the example of the [[National Rifle Association of America]], which he says intentionally created a culture war in order to unite conservative groups, particularly groups of white men, against a common perceived threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Melzer |first=Scott |date=October 1, 2009 |title=Gun Crusaders: The NRA's Culture War |url=https://nyupress.org/9780814795507/gun-crusaders/ |publisher=New York University Press |page=59 |isbn=978-0814764503 |access-date=May 25, 2020 |archive-date=April 6, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230406001357/https://nyupress.org/9780814795507/gun-crusaders/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, religion scholar Susan B. Ridgely has written that culture wars were made possible by [[Focus on the Family]]. This organization produced conservative Christian "[[alternative news]]" that began to bifurcate American media consumption, promoting a particular "traditional family" archetype to one part of the population, particularly conservative religious women. Ridgely says that this tradition was depicted as under liberal attack, seeming to necessitate a culture war to defend the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ridgely |first=Susan B. |date=March 2020 |title=Conservative Christianity and the Creation of Alternative News: An Analysis of Focus on the Family's Multimedia Empire |journal=Religion and American Culture |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=1–25 |doi=10.1017/rac.2020.1|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientists Matt Grossmann and David A. Hopkins have written about an asymmetry between the US's two major political parties, saying the Republican party should be understood as an ideological movement built to wage political conflict, and the Democratic party as a coalition of social groups with less ability to impose ideological discipline on members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grossmann |first1=Matt |last2=Hopkins |first2=David A. |date=March 2015 |title=Ideological Republicans and Group Interest Democrats: The Asymmetry of American Party Politics |journal=Perspectives on Politics |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=119–139 |doi=10.1017/S1537592714003168 |s2cid=144639776 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This encourages Republicans to perpetuate and to draw new issues into culture wars, because Republicans are well equipped to fight such wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.honestgraft.com/2020/04/solving-covid-crisis-requires.html |title=Solving the COVID Crisis Requires Bipartisanship, But the Modern GOP Isn't Built for It |last=Hopkins |first=David A. |date=April 15, 2020 |website=Honest Graft |access-date=May 24, 2020 |archive-date=May 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200518135152/http://www.honestgraft.com/2020/04/solving-covid-crisis-requires.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', "many on the left have argued that such [culture war] battles [a]re 'distractions' from the real fight over class and economic issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=O. Taiwo |first=Olufemi |date=2022-05-16 |title=Are culture wars really a distraction? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/16/are-culture-wars-distraction-critical-race-theory |access-date=2022-07-17 |website=[[The Guardian]] |language=en |archive-date=July 17, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220717045600/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/16/are-culture-wars-distraction-critical-race-theory |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In American usage, ''culture war'' may imply a conflict between those values considered [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] or [[Conservativism in the United States|conservative]] and those considered [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] or [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]. This usage originated in the 1920s when urban and rural American values came into closer conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=Fall 2001|title=Seminar on the Culture Wars of the 1920s|url=http://www1.assumption.edu/ahc/1920s/|access-date=October 24, 2021|archive-date=October 25, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211025063441/http://www1.assumption.edu/ahc/1920s/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed several decades of immigration to the States by people who earlier European immigrants considered 'alien'. It was also a result of the cultural shifts and modernizing trends of the [[Roaring Twenties]], culminating in the presidential campaign of [[Al Smith]] in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dionne|first=E.

====1991–2001: Rise in prominence====
[[James Davison Hunter]], a [[sociologist]] at the [[University of Virginia]], introduced the expression again in his 1991 publication, ''[[Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America]]''. Hunter described what he saw as a dramatic realignment and polarization that had transformed [[politics of the United States|American politics]] and [[American culture|culture]].

He argued that on an increasing number of "[[Hot-button issue|hot-button]]" defining issues—[[abortion]], [[gun politics]], [[separation of church and state]], [[privacy]], [[recreational drug use]], [[homosexuality]], [[censorship]]—there existed two definable polarities. Furthermore, not only were there a number of divisive issues, but society had divided along essentially the same lines on these issues, so as to constitute two warring groups, defined primarily not by nominal religion, ethnicity, social class, or even political affiliation, but rather by ideological [[world-view]]s.

Hunter characterized this polarity as stemming from opposite impulses, toward what he referred to as ''Progressivism'' and as ''Orthodoxy''. Others have adopted the dichotomy with varying labels. For example, [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], a conservative political commentator and former host of the [[Fox News Channel]] talk show ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', emphasizes differences between "Secular-Progressives" and "Traditionalists" in his 2006 book ''[[Culture Warrior]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Dakss,

Historian [[Kristin Kobes Du Mez]] attributes the 1990s emergence of culture wars to the end of the [[Cold War]] in 1991. She writes that [[Evangelical Christians]] viewed a particular Christian masculine [[gender role]] as the only defense of America against the threat of [[communism]]. When this threat ended upon the close of the Cold War, Evangelical leaders transferred the perceived source of threat from foreign communism to domestic changes in gender roles and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Illing |first=Sean |date=July 9, 2020 |title=Is evangelical support for Trump a contradiction? |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/7/9/21291493/donald-trump-evangelical-christians-kristin-kobes-du-mez |work=Vox |access-date=July 9, 2020 |archive-date=June 16, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230616155249/https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/7/9/21291493/donald-trump-evangelical-christians-kristin-kobes-du-mez |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Patrickjbuchanan.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Pat Buchanan in 2008]]
During the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential election]], commentator [[Pat Buchanan]] mounted [[Pat Buchanan#1992 presidential primaries|a campaign]] for the [[1992 Republican Party presidential primaries|Republican nomination for president]] against incumbent [[George H. W. Bush]]. In a [[Prime time|prime]]-[[time slot]] at the [[1992 Republican National Convention]], Buchanan gave his speech on the culture war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote=Not since Pat Buchanan's famous 'culture war' speech in 1992 has a major speaker at a national political convention spoken so hatefully, at such length, about the opposition. |title=Dogs of War |url=http://www.newdonkey.com/2004/09/dogs-of-war.html |url-status=dead |publisher=New Donkey |date=September 2, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308043424/http://www.newdonkey.com/2004/09/dogs-of-war.html |archive-date=March 8, 2005 |access-date=August 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued: "There is a religious war going on in our country for the soul of America. It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we will one day be as was the Cold War itself."&lt;ref name="1992-GOP"&gt;{{Cite speech |author-link=Patrick Buchanan |first=Patrick |last=Buchanan |title=1992 Republican National Convention Speech |date=August 17, 1992 |url=http://buchanan.org/blog/1992-republican-national-convention-speech-148 |access-date=November 3, 2014 |archive-date=December 8, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201208185713/https://buchanan.org/blog/1992-republican-national-convention-speech-148 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to criticizing [[Environmental movement in the United States|environmentalists]] and [[Feminism in the United States|feminism]], he portrayed [[public morality]] as a [[defining issue]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The agenda [Bill] Clinton and [Hillary] Clinton would impose on America—abortion on demand, a [[Litmus test (politics)|litmus test]] for the Supreme Court, homosexual rights, discrimination against religious schools, women in combat units—that's change, all right. But it is not the kind of change America wants. It is not the kind of change America needs. And it is not the kind of change we can abide in a nation that we still call God's country.&lt;ref name="1992-GOP" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A month later, Buchanan characterized the conflict as about power over society's definition of right and wrong. He named abortion, sexual orientation and popular culture as major fronts—and mentioned other controversies, including clashes over the [[Confederate flag]], Christmas, and taxpayer-funded art. He also said that the negative attention his "culture war" speech received was itself evidence of America's polarization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buchanan.org/blog/the-cultural-war-for-the-soul-of-america-149 |title=The Cultural War for the Soul of America |last=Buchanan |first=Patrick |author-link=Patrick Buchanan |access-date=March 6, 2015 |archive-date=March 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317033220/http://buchanan.org/blog/the-cultural-war-for-the-soul-of-america-149 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A political view called [[neoconservatism]] shifted the terms of the debate in the early 2000s. Neoconservatives differed from their opponents in that they interpreted problems facing the nation as [[moral issues]] rather than economic or political ones.

This broader understanding of culture war issues in the mid-late 2010s and 2020s is associated with a political strategy called "[[owning the libs]]." Conservative media figures employing this strategy emphasize and expand upon culture war issues with the goal of upsetting liberals. According to [[Nicole Hemmer]] of Columbia University, this strategy is a substitute for the cohesive conservative ideology that existed during the [[Cold War]]. It holds a conservative [[voting bloc]] together in the absence of shared policy preferences among the bloc's members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Peters |first=Jeremy W. |date=August 3, 2020 |title=These Conservatives Have a Laser Focus: 'Owning the Libs' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/us/politics/the-federalist-trump-liberals.html |work=New York Times |access-date=August 3, 2020 |archive-date=August 3, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803161740/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/us/politics/the-federalist-trump-liberals.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Australian Prime Ministers, [[Paul Keating]] (in office 1991–1996) and John Howard (in office 1996–2007), became major participants in the "wars".

He accused [[United Kingdom|Britain]] of having abandoned Australia during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Keating staunchly supported a symbolic apology to [[Aboriginal Australians|Australian Aboriginals]] for their mistreatment at the hands of previous administrations, and outlined his view of the origins and potential solutions to contemporary Aboriginal disadvantage in his [[Redfern Park Speech]] of 10 December 1992 (drafted with the assistance of historian [[Don Watson]]). In 1999, following the release of the 1998 ''[[Bringing Them Home]]'' Report, Howard passed a Parliamentary [[Motion of Reconciliation]] describing treatment of Aborigines as the "most blemished chapter" in Australian history, but he refused to issue an official apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thinkingfaith.org/articles/20080221_1.htm |title= The History of Apologies Down Under &amp;#124; Thinking Faith |publisher= thinkingfaith.org |date= February 21, 2008 |access-date= March 5, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141202000730/http://www.thinkingfaith.org/articles/20080221_1.htm |archive-date= December 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard saw an apology as inappropriate as it would imply "intergeneration guilt"; he said that "practical" measures were a better response to contemporary Aboriginal disadvantage.

Unlike fellow Labor leaders and contemporaries, [[Bob Hawke]] (Prime Minister 1983–1991) and [[Kim Beazley]] (Labor Party leader 2005–2006), Keating never traveled to [[Gallipoli]] for ANZAC Day ceremonies.

In 2006 John Howard said in a speech to mark the 50th anniversary of ''Quadrant'' that [[Political correctness|"Political Correctness"]] was dead in Australia but: "we should not underestimate the degree to which the soft-left still holds sway, even dominance, especially in Australia's universities".{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} Also in 2006, [[The Sydney Morning Herald|''Sydney Morning Herald'']] political editor [[Peter Hartcher]] reported that Opposition foreign-affairs spokesman [[Kevin Rudd]] was entering the philosophical debate by arguing in response that "John Howard, is guilty of perpetrating 'a fraud' in his so-called culture wars&amp;nbsp;... designed not to make real change but to mask the damage inflicted by the Government's economic policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/pms-culture-wars-a-fraud-rudd/2006/10/27/1161749320974.html |title= PM's culture wars a fraud: Rudd - National |work= The Sydney Morning Herald |date= October 28, 2006 |access-date= April 27, 2010 |archive-date= June 5, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110605030058/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/pms-culture-wars-a-fraud-rudd/2006/10/27/1161749320974.html |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of the Howard government in the [[2007 Australian federal election|Australian Federal election of 2007]] and its replacement by the [[First Rudd Government|Rudd Labor government]] altered the dynamic of the debate.

===African continent===

According to political scientist Constance G. Anthony, American culture war perspectives on human sexuality were exported to Africa as a form of [[neocolonialism]]. In his view, this began during the [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|AIDS epidemic in Africa]], with the United States government first tying HIV/AIDS assistance money to evangelical leadership and the [[Christian right]] during the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]], then to LGBTQ tolerance during the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|administration]] of [[Barack Obama]]. This stoked a culture war that resulted in (among others) the [[Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2014|''Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Act'']] of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anthony |first=Constance G. |date=November 2018 |title=Schizophrenic Neocolonialism: Exporting the American Culture War on Sexuality to Africa |journal=International Studies Perspectives |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=289–304 |doi=10.1093/isp/eky004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zambian scholar [[Kapya Kaoma]] notes that because "the demographic center of Christianity is shifting from the [[global North]] to the [[global South]]" Africa's influence on Christianity worldwide is increasing. American conservatives export their culture wars to Africa, Kaoma says, particularly when they realize they may be losing the battle back home. US Christians have framed their anti-LGBT initiatives in Africa as standing in opposition to a "Western [[gay agenda]]", a framing which Kaoma finds ironic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Klinken|first=Adriaan|date=2017|title=Culture Wars, Race, and Sexuality: A Nascent Pan-African LGBT-Affirming Christian Movement and the Future of Christianity|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/jafrireli.5.2.0217|journal=Journal of Africana Religions|volume=5|issue=2|pages=217–238|doi=10.5325/jafrireli.5.2.0217|jstor=10.5325/jafrireli.5.2.0217|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210810082713/https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/jafrireli.5.2.0217|archive-date=August 10, 2021|access-date=May 4, 2021|url-status=bot: unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North American and European conspiracy theories have become widespread in [[West Africa]] via social media, according to 2021 survey by ''[[First Draft News]]''. [[COVID-19 misinformation]], [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]] conspiracy thinking, [[QAnon]] and other conspiracy theories associated with culture war topics are spread by American, Pro-Russian, French-language, and local [[disinformation]] websites and social media accounts, including prominent politicians in [[Nigeria]]. This has contributed to [[vaccine hesitancy]] in West Africa, with 60 percent of survey respondents saying they were unlikely to try to get vaccinated, and an erosion of trust in institutions in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |first1=Carlotta |last1=Dotto |first2=Seb |last2=Cubbon |date=June 23, 2021 |title=Disinformation exports: How foreign anti-vaccine narratives reached West African communities online |url=https://firstdraftnews.org/long-form-article/foreign-anti-vaccine-disinformation-reaches-west-africa/ |publisher=First Draft News |access-date=June 23, 2021 |archive-date=June 23, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210623070135/https://firstdraftnews.org/long-form-article/foreign-anti-vaccine-disinformation-reaches-west-africa/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2021 report from [[King's College London]] argued that many people's views on cultural issues in Britain had become tied up with the side of the [[Brexit]] debate with which they identify, while the public party-political identities, although not as strong, show similar alignments and that around half the country held relatively strong views on "culture war" issues such as debates on Britain's colonial history or Black Lives Matter. However, the report concluded Britain's cultural and political divide was not as stark as the Republican–Democratic divide in the US and that a sizeable section of the public can be categorised as having either moderate views or as being disengaged from social debates. It also found that ''[[The Guardian]]'', as opposed to the centre-right newspapers, was more likely to talk about the culture wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Duffy |first1=Bobby |last2=Hewlett |first2=Kirstie |last3=Murkin |first3=George |last4=Benson |first4=Rebecca |last5=Hesketh |first5=Rachel |last6=Page |first6=Ben |last7=Skinner |first7=Gideon |last8=Gottfried |first8=Glenn |date=June 2021 |title='Culture wars' in the UK |url=https://www.kcl.ac.uk/policy-institute/assets/culture-wars-in-the-uk.pdf |website=The Policy Institute at King's College London |access-date=November 2, 2023 |archive-date=November 2, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231102135835/https://www.kcl.ac.uk/policy-institute/assets/culture-wars-in-the-uk.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] have been described as attempting to ignite culture wars in regard to "conservative values" under the tenure of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Boris Johnson]].

An April 2022 survey found evidence that Britons are less divided on "culture war" issues than has often been portrayed in the media. The greatest predictor of opinion was how people voted in the UK's referendum on membership of the European Union, [[Brexit]], yet even among those who voted 'Leave', 75% agreed "it is important to be attentive to issues of race and social justice". Similarly, even among Remainers and those who last voted for the Labour Party, there was moderately strong support for several socially conservative positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/01/four-in-five-people-in-the-uk-believe-in-being-woke-to-race-and-social-justice |title=Four in five people in the UK believe in being 'woke' to race and social justice |work=[[The Guardian]] |first=Michael |last=Savage |date=1 May 2022 |access-date=3 May 2022 |archive-date=May 3, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220503201928/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/01/four-in-five-people-in-the-uk-believe-in-being-woke-to-race-and-social-justice |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="InCommon"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ourglobalfuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GF_TheCentreHolds_Report_10.pdf |title=The Centre Holds |work=Global Future |first1=Renie |last1=Anjeh |first2=Isabel |last2=Doraisamy |date=April 2022 |access-date=3 May 2022 |archive-date=January 29, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230129165934/https://ourglobalfuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GF_TheCentreHolds_Report_10.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One facet of the controversy in Poland is the removal of [[Soviet War Memorials]] which is divisive because some Poles viewed the memorials positively as commemorations of their ancestors who died during [[World War II]] while others felt negatively due to the oppression that some Poles experienced under the Soviet-backed [[Polish People's Republic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Poland plans to tear down hundreds of Soviet memorials |url=https://www.dw.com/en/poland-plans-to-tear-down-hundreds-of-soviet-memorials/a-19185159 |work=Deutsche Welle |date=13 April 2016 |access-date=October 31, 2021 |archive-date=March 26, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220326170823/https://www.dw.com/en/poland-plans-to-tear-down-hundreds-of-soviet-memorials/a-19185159 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Then And Now: Soviet Monuments Disappear Across Poland |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/then-and-now-photos-show-soviet-monuments-disappearing-in-poland-after-decommunization-law/30905305.html |work=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |date=23 October 2020 |access-date=October 31, 2021 |archive-date=March 30, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220330064935/https://www.rferl.org/a/then-and-now-photos-show-soviet-monuments-disappearing-in-poland-after-decommunization-law/30905305.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Culture war in Hungary is alleged by [[Kim Scheppele]] to be a disguise for [[democratic backsliding]] by Viktor Orbán.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Here's why American conservatives are heading to Hungary for a big conference |language=en |work=NPR.org |url=https://www.npr.org/2022/05/18/1099680587/a-prominent-conference-of-american-conservatives-is-taking-place-in-hungary |access-date=2022-05-19 |archive-date=May 19, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220519173042/https://www.npr.org/2022/05/18/1099680587/a-prominent-conference-of-american-conservatives-is-taking-place-in-hungary |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ukraine, meanwhile, has experienced a decades-long culture war pitting the eastern, predominately Russian-speaking, regions against the western Ukrainian-speaking areas of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ukraine's Culture War |url=https://nationalinterest.org/commentary/ukraines-culture-war-9838 |work=The National Interest |date=7 February 2014 |access-date=October 31, 2021 |archive-date=October 22, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211022235721/https://nationalinterest.org/commentary/ukraines-culture-war-9838 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; LGBT rights are controversial in Poland, as exemplified by President [[Andrzej Duda]]'s vow in 2020 to oppose both [[same-sex marriage]] and [[LGBT adoption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=Polish President Calls 'LGBT Ideology' More Harmful Than Communism|url=https://time.com/5853277/andrzej-duda-lgbt-ideology-communism/|access-date=2020-06-14|magazine=Time|language=en|archive-date=June 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200613203428/https://time.com/5853277/andrzej-duda-lgbt-ideology-communism/|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Polish election: Andrzej Duda says LGBT 'ideology' worse than communism |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53039864 |publisher=BBC News |date=14 June 2020 |access-date=October 31, 2021 |archive-date=October 31, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211031095804/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53039864 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different interpretations of bitter events during [[World War II]] have become especially contentious in Poland since 2015, shortly after the start of the [[Russo-Ukrainian War]].&lt;ref name=carnegie&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/75029 | title=The Polish-Ukrainian Battle for the Past}}, Carnegie Europe&lt;/ref&gt; One disputed issue is whether Poland bears any [[responsibility for the Holocaust|responsibility]] for the [[Holocaust in Poland|Holocaust]], or whether Poland was entirely a victim of [[Nazi Germany]]. This dispute is embodied by the [["Polish death camp" controversy|"Polish death camp"]] controversy (involving [[concentration camp]]s that had been built by [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]] on German-occupied Polish soil) and an attempt to address that controversy with a now [[Amendment to the Act on the Institute of National Remembrance|partly repealed law]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hackmann |first1=Jörg |title=Defending the "Good Name" of the Polish Nation: Politics of History as a Battlefield in Poland, 2015–18 |journal=Journal of Genocide Research |date=2018 |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=587–606 |doi=10.1080/14623528.2018.1528742|s2cid=81922100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second issue, also addressed by the partly repealed law, revolves around [[Poland–Ukraine relations]]
