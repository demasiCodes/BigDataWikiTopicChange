A '''culture war''' is a [[cultural conflict]] between social groups and the struggle for [[Dominant culture|dominance]] of their [[Value (ethics)|values]], beliefs, and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/culture-war|title=Culture war|website=[[Dictionary.com]]|language=en|access-date=2019-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It commonly refers to topics on which there is general societal disagreement and [[Political polarization|polarization]] in societal values.

The term is commonly used to describe aspects of contemporary politics in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This includes [[wedge issues]] such as [[abortion]], [[homosexuality]], [[transgender rights]], [[pornography]], [[multiculturalism]], [[racism]] and other cultural conflicts based on values, [[morality]], and [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] which are described as the major [[political cleavage]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/legal-and-political-magazines/culture-wars|title=Culture Wars|website=[[Encyclopedia.com]]|access-date=2019-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Etymology===
The term ''culture war'' is a loan translation ([[calque]]) of the German ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' ('culture struggle'). In German, ''Kulturkampf'', a term coined by [[Rudolf Virchow]], refers to the clash between cultural and religious groups in the campaign from 1871 to 1878 under [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] of the [[German Empire]] against the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Kulturkampf |encyclopedia=[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]] |year=1910 |publisher=[[Robert Appleton Company]] |location=New York |volume=8 |access-date=March 27, 2015 |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08703b.htm |last=Spahn |first=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The translation was printed in some American newspapers at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/clip/29456963/prosecution_of_priests_culture_war/|title=Prosecution of priests (Culture War reference) (1874)|website=Newspapers.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1920s–1980s: Origins===
In American usage, "culture war" may imply a conflict between those values considered [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] or [[Conservativism in the United States|conservative]] and those considered [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] or [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]. This usage originated in the 1920s when urban and rural American values came into closer conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=Fall 2001|title=Seminar on the Culture Wars of the 1920s|url=http://www1.assumption.edu/ahc/1920s/|access-date=October 24, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed several decades of immigration to the States by people who earlier European immigrants considered 'alien'. It was also a result of the cultural shifts and modernizing trends of the [[Roaring Twenties|Roaring '20s]], culminating in the presidential campaign of [[Al Smith]] in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dionne|first=E.

Dionne|title=Culture Wars: How 2004|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/03/reclaiming_faith_and_politics.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent decades during the 20th century, the term was published occasionally in American newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What Bismarck could not do (Culture War reference) (1906)|url=http://www.newspapers.com/clip/29457081/what_bismarck_could_not_do_culture_war/|access-date=2019-03-13|website=Newspapers.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title='Culture War' to be theme of talk (1942)|url=http://www.newspapers.com/clip/29456609/culture_war_to_be_theme_of_talk_1942/|access-date=2019-03-13|website=Newspapers.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1991–2001: Rise in prominence===
[[James Davison Hunter]], a [[sociologist]] at the [[University of Virginia]], introduced the expression again in his 1991 publication, ''[[Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America]]''. Hunter described what he saw as a dramatic realignment and polarization that had transformed [[politics of the United States|American politics]] and [[American culture|culture]].

He argued that on an increasing number of "[[Hot-button issue|hot-button]]" defining issues—[[abortion]], [[gun politics]], [[separation of church and state]], [[privacy]], [[recreational drug use]], [[homosexuality]], [[censorship]]—there existed two definable polarities. Furthermore, not only were there a number of divisive issues, but society had divided along essentially the same lines on these issues, so as to constitute two warring groups, defined primarily not by nominal religion, ethnicity, social class, or even political affiliation, but rather by ideological [[world-view]]s.

Hunter characterized this polarity as stemming from opposite impulses, toward what he referred to as ''Progressivism'' and as ''Orthodoxy''. Others have adopted the dichotomy with varying labels. For example, [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], a conservative political commentator and former host of the [[Fox News Channel]] talk show ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', emphasizes differences between "Secular-Progressives" and "Traditionalists" in his 2006 book ''[[Culture Warrior]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Dakss,

Historian [[Kristin Kobes Du Mez]] attributes the 1990s emergence of culture wars to the end of the [[Cold War]] in 1991. She writes that [[Evangelical Christians]] viewed a particular Christian masculine [[gender role]] as the only defense of America against the threat of [[communism]]. When this threat ended upon the close of the Cold War, Evangelical leaders transferred the perceived source of threat from foreign communism to domestic changes in gender roles and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Illing |first=Sean |date=July 9, 2020 |title=Is evangelical support for Trump a contradiction? |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/7/9/21291493/donald-trump-evangelical-christians-kristin-kobes-du-mez |work=Vox |access-date=July 9, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Patrickjbuchanan.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Pat Buchanan in 2008]]
During the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential election]], commentator [[Pat Buchanan]] mounted [[Pat Buchanan 2000 presidential campaign|a campaign]] for the [[1992 Republican Party presidential primaries|Republican nomination for president]] against incumbent [[George H. W. Bush]]. In a [[Prime time|prime]]-[[time slot]] at the [[1992 Republican National Convention]], Buchanan gave his speech on the culture war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote=Not since Pat Buchanan's famous 'culture war' speech in 1992 has a major speaker at a national political convention spoken so hatefully, at such length, about the opposition. |title=Dogs of War |url=http://www.newdonkey.com/2004/09/dogs-of-war.html |url-status=dead |publisher=New Donkey |date=September 2, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308043424/http://www.newdonkey.com/2004/09/dogs-of-war.html |archive-date=March 8, 2005 |access-date=August 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued: "There is a religious war going on in our country for the soul of America. It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we will one day be as was the Cold War itself."&lt;ref name="1992-GOP"&gt;{{Cite speech |author-link=Patrick Buchanan |first=Patrick |last=Buchanan |title=1992 Republican National Convention Speech |date=August 17, 1992 |url=http://buchanan.org/blog/1992-republican-national-convention-speech-148 |access-date=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to criticizing [[Environmental movement in the United States|environmentalists]] and [[Feminism in the United States|feminism]], he portrayed [[public morality]] as a [[defining issue]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The agenda [Bill] Clinton and [Hillary] Clinton would impose on America—abortion on demand, a [[Litmus test (politics)|litmus test]] for the Supreme Court, homosexual rights, discrimination against religious schools, women in combat units—that's change, all right. But it is not the kind of change America wants. It is not the kind of change America needs. And it is not the kind of change we can tolerate in a nation that we still call God's country.&lt;ref name="1992-GOP" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A month later, Buchanan characterized the conflict as about power over society's definition of right and wrong. He named abortion, sexual orientation and popular culture as major fronts—and mentioned other controversies, including clashes over the [[Confederate flag]], Christmas, and taxpayer-funded art. He also said that the negative attention his "culture war" speech received was itself evidence of America's polarization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buchanan.org/blog/the-cultural-war-for-the-soul-of-america-149 |title=The Cultural War for the Soul of America |last=Buchanan |first=Patrick |author-link=Patrick Buchanan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The culture war had significant impact on national politics in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Andrew Hartman 2015"&gt;Andrew Hartman, ''A War for the Soul of America: A History of the Culture Wars'' (University of Chicago Press, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; The rhetoric of the [[Christian Coalition of America]] may have weakened president George H. W. Bush's chances for re-election in 1992 and helped his successor, [[Bill Clinton]], win reelection in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chapman |first=Roger |title=Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints, and Voices |year=2010 |publisher=M.

The culture wars influenced the debate over [[State school|state-school]] history [[Curriculum|curricula]] in the United States in the 1990s. In particular, debates over the development of [[Standards-based education reform in the United States|national educational standards]] in 1994 revolved around whether the study of American history should be a "celebratory" or "critical" undertaking and involved such prominent public figures as [[Lynne Cheney]], the late [[Rush Limbaugh]], and historian [[Gary Nash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{google book |title=Who Owns History: Rethinking the Past in a Changing World |last=Foner |first=Eric |id=H3I-Z8KW5REC |location=New York |publisher=Hill &amp; Wang |year=2002 |isbn=1-4299-2392-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{google book |title=History on Trial: Culture Wars and the Teaching of the Past |last1=Nash |first1=Gary B. |authorlink1=Gary B.

===2001–2014: Post-9/11 era===
[[File:Bush War Budget 2003-crop.jpg|thumb|43rd President [[George W. Bush]], [[Donald Rumsfeld]], and [[Paul Wolfowitz]] were prominent neoconservatives of the 2000s.]]
A political view called [[neoconservatism]] shifted the terms of the debate in the early 2000s. Neoconservatives differed from their opponents in that they interpreted problems facing the nation as [[moral issues]] rather than economic or political issues. For example, neoconservatives saw the decline of the traditional [[Family structure in the United States|family structure]] as a [[spiritual crisis]] that required a spiritual response. Critics accused neoconservatives of [[Correlation does not imply causation|confusing cause and effect]].&lt;ref&gt;Zafirovski, Milan.

During the 2000s, voting for Republicans began to correlate heavily with [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] or [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] religious belief across diverse religious sects. Voting for Democrats became more correlated to [[Religious liberalism|liberal]] or [[Modernism in the Catholic Church|modernist]] religious belief, and to being [[nonreligious]].&lt;ref name="Dionne2006"&gt;Dionne, E.J., Jr.

===2014–present: Broadening of the culture war===
{{Seealso|List of monuments and memorials removed during the George Floyd protests|List of changes made due to the George Floyd protests}}
While traditional culture war issues, notably abortion, continue to be a focal point,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Karl.  [https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-05-21/abortion-debate-it-s-different-from-other-culture-wars "The Abortion Debate Is Not Part of the Culture Wars."] ''Bloomberg''.&lt;/ref&gt; the issues identified with culture war broadened and intensified in the mid-late 2010s. Journalist [[Michael Grunwald]] says that "President [[Donald Trump]] has pioneered a new politics of perpetual culture war" and lists the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement, [[U.S. national anthem protests]], [[climate change]], education policy, healthcare policy including [[Obamacare]], and infrastructure policy as culture war issues in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Grunwald |first=Michael |date=November 2018 |title=How Everything Became the Culture War |url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/11/02/culture-war-liberals-conservatives-trump-2018-222095 |magazine=Politico |access-date=May 24, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rights of [[transgender]] people and the role of religion in lawmaking were identified as "new fronts in the culture war" by political scientist Jeremiah Castle, as the polarization of public opinion on these two topics resemble that of previous culture war issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Castle |first1=Jeremiah |date=December 14, 2018 |title=New Fronts in the Culture Wars?

This broader understanding of culture war issues in the mid-late 2010s and 2020s is associated with a political strategy called "[[owning the libs]]." Conservative media figures employing this strategy, prominently [[Ben Shapiro]], emphasize and expand upon culture war issues with the goal of upsetting liberal people. According to [[Nicole Hemmer]] of Columbia University, this strategy is a substitute for the cohesive conservative ideology that existed during the [[Cold War]]. It holds a conservative [[voting bloc]] together in the absence of shared policy preferences among the bloc's members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Peters |first=Jeremy W. |date=August 3, 2020 |title=These Conservatives Have a Laser Focus: 'Owning the Libs' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/us/politics/the-federalist-trump-liberals.html |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of conflicts about diversity in popular culture occurring in the 2010s, such as the [[Gamergate controversy]], [[Comicsgate]] and the [[Sad Puppies]] science fiction voting campaign, were identified in the media as being examples of the culture war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Hurley |first=Kameron |author-link=Kameron Hurley |date=April 9, 2015 |title=Hijacking the Hugo Awards Won't Stifle Diversity in Science Fiction |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/04/the-culture-wars-come-to-sci-fi/390012/ |magazine=The Atlantic |access-date=May 23, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Caitlin Dewey]] described Gamergate as a "[[proxy war]]" for a larger culture war between those who want greater inclusion of women and minorities in cultural institutions versus anti-feminists and traditionalists who do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dewey |first=Caitlin |date=October 14, 2014 |title=The only guide to Gamergate you will ever need to read |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/10/14/the-only-guide-to-gamergate-you-will-ever-need-to-read/ |work=The Washington Post |access-date=May 23, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The perception that culture war conflict had been demoted from electoral politics to popular culture led writer Jack Meserve to call popular movies, games, and writing the "last front in the culture war" in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meserve |first1=Jack |date=Spring 2015 |title=Last Front in the Culture War |url=https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/36/last-front-in-the-culture-war/ |journal=Democracy: A Journal of Ideas |issue=36 |access-date=May 23, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These conflicts about representation in popular culture re-emerged into electoral politics via the [[alt-right]] and [[alt-lite]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nagle |first=Angela |author-link=Angela Nagle |date=June 30, 2017 |title=Kill All Normies: Online Culture Wars From 4Chan And Tumblr To Trump And The Alt-Right |publisher=Zero Books |isbn=9781785355431}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to media scholar Whitney Phillips, Gamergate "prototyped" strategies of harassment and controversy-stoking that proved useful in political strategy. For example, Republican political strategist [[Steve Bannon]] publicized pop-culture conflicts during the 2016 presidential campaign of [[Donald Trump]], encouraging a young audience to "come in through Gamergate or whatever and then get turned onto politics and Trump."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Warzel |first=Charlie |date=August 15, 2019 |title=How an Online Mob Created a Playbook for a Culture War |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/15/opinion/what-is-gamergate.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=May 24, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism and evaluation===

Since the time that James Davison Hunter first applied the concept of culture wars to American life, the idea has been subject to questions about whether "culture wars" names a real phenomenon, and if so, whether the phenomenon it describes is a cause of, or merely a result of, membership in groups like political parties and religions. Culture wars have also been subject to the criticism of being artificial, imposed, or asymmetric conflicts, rather than a result of authentic differences between cultures.

====Validity====

Researchers have differed about the [[Validity (statistics)|scientific validity]] of the notion of culture war. Some claim it does not describe real behavior, or that it describes only the behavior of a small political elite. Others claim culture war is real and widespread, and even that it is fundamental to explaining Americans' political behavior and beliefs.

Political scientist [[Alan Wolfe]] participated in a series of scholarly debates in the 1990s and 2000s against Hunter, claiming that Hunter's concept of culture wars did not accurately describe the opinions or behavior of Americans, which Wolfe claimed were more united than polarized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hunter |first1=James Davison |last2=Wolfe |first2=Alan |date= 2006 |title=Is There a Culture War? : A Dialogue on Values and American Public Life |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |oclc=76966750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[meta-analysis]] of opinion data from 1992 to 2012 published in the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' concluded that, in contrast to a common belief that political party and religious membership shape opinion on culture war topics, instead opinions on culture war topics lead people to revise their political party and religious orientations. The researchers view culture war attitudes as "foundational elements in the political and religious belief systems of ordinary citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goren |first1=Paul |last2=Chapp |first2=Christopher |date=February 24, 2017 |title=Moral Power: How Public Opinion on Culture War Issues Shapes Partisan Predispositions and Religious Orientations |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=111 |issue=1 |pages=110–128 |doi=10.1017/S0003055416000435 |s2cid=151573922 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Artificiality or asymmetry====

Some writers and scholars have said that culture wars are created or perpetuated by political special interest groups, by reactionary social movements, by dynamics within the Republican party, or by electoral politics as a whole. These authors view culture war not as an unavoidable result of widespread cultural differences, but as a technique used to create [[In-group and out-group|in-groups and out-groups]] for a political purpose.

Political commentator E. J. Dionne has written that culture war is an electoral technique to exploit differences and grievances, remarking that the real cultural division is "between those who want to have a culture war and those who don't."&lt;ref name="Dionne2006" /&gt;

Sociologist Scott Melzer says that culture wars are created by conservative, reactive organizations and movements. Members of these movements possess a "sense of victimization at the hands of a liberal culture run amok. In their eyes, immigrants, gays, women, the poor, and other groups are (undeservedly) granted special rights and privileges." Melzer writes about the example of the [[National Rifle Association]], which he says intentionally created a culture war in order to unite conservative groups, particularly groups of white men, against a common perceived threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Melzer |first=Scott |date=October 1, 2009 |title=Gun Crusaders: The NRA's Culture War |url=https://nyupress.org/9780814795507/gun-crusaders/ |publisher=New York University Press |page=59 |isbn=978-0814764503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, religion scholar Susan B. Ridgely has written that culture wars were made possible by [[Focus on the Family]]. This organization produced conservative Christian "[[alternative news]]" that began to bifurcate American media consumption, promoting a particular "traditional family" archetype to one part of the population, particularly conservative religious women.

Political scientists Matt Grossmann and David A.

Some observers in [[Canada]] have used the term "culture war" to refer to differing values between [[Western Canada|Western]] versus [[Eastern Canada]], [[List of the largest population centres in Canada|urban]] versus [[rural Canada]], as well as [[Conservatism in Canada|conservatism]] versus [[Liberalism in Canada|liberalism]] and [[Progressivism in Canada|progressivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Gerald|last=Caplan |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/second-reading/culture-clash-splits-canadians-over-basic-values/article4626123/ |location=Toronto|work=The Globe and Mail |title=Culture clash splits Canadians over basic values |date=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Canadian society is generally not dramatically polarized over immigration, gun control, drug legality, sexual morality, or government involvement in healthcare: the main issues at play in the United States.  In all of those cases, the majority of Canadians, including Conservatives would support the "progressive" position in the United States.  In Canada a different set of issues create a clash of values.  Chief among these are [[language policy in Canada]], [[reasonable accommodation (Quebec)|minority religious rights]], [[pipeline politics]], [[indigenous land rights]], [[climate policy]], and [[Canadian federalism|federal-provincial disputes]].

It is a relatively new phrase in Canadian political commentary. It can still be used to describe historical events in Canada, such as the [[Rebellions of 1837]], [[Western Alienation]], the [[Quebec sovereignty movement]], and any [[:Category:Aboriginal conflicts in Canada|Aboriginal conflicts in Canada]]; but is more relevant to current events such as the [[Grand River land dispute]] and the increasing hostility between conservative and liberal Canadians.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The phrase has also been used to describe the [[Premiership of Stephen Harper|Harper government]]'s attitude towards the [[Art in Canada|arts community]]. [[Andrew Coyne]] termed this negative policy towards the arts community as "[[class warfare]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.macleans.ca/general/this-isnt-a-culture-war-its-a-good-old-class-war/ |title= Coyne: This isn't a culture war, it's a good old class war |author= Andrew Coyne |date= October 2, 2008 |work= Macleans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History wars}}
During the tenure of the [[Coalition (Australia)|Liberal–National Coalition]] government of 1996 to 2007, interpretations of [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] history became a part of a wider political debate regarding Australian national pride and symbolism occasionally called the "[[History wars#History wars and culture wars|culture wars]]", more often the "history wars".&lt;ref name="Manne11/08"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2008/november/1277253191/robert-manne/what-rudd-s-agenda |last= Manne |first= Robert |author-link= Robert Manne |title= What is Rudd's Agenda? |work= [[The Monthly]] |date= November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This debate extended into [[#National Museum of Australia controversy|a controversy]] over the presentation of history in the [[National Museum of Australia]] and in [[Education in Australia|high-school]] history curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Rundle |first= Guy |url= http://www.crikey.com.au/2007/06/28/1915-and-all-that-history-in-a-holding-pattern/ |title= 1915 and all that: History in a holding pattern |work= Crikey |date= June 28, 2007 |access-date= April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Ferrari |first= Justine&lt;!--Education writer--&gt; |url= http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24492542-13881,00.html |title= History curriculum author defies his critics to find bias |work= The Australian |date= October 14, 2008 |access-date= April 27, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091006084757/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24492542-13881,00.html |archive-date= October 6, 2009 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also migrated into the general Australian media, with major broadsheets such as ''[[The Australian]]'', ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]'' regularly publishing opinion pieces on the topic. [[Marcia Langton]] has referred to much of this wider debate as "war porn"&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard J. War porn. ''Journal of Visual Culture'', Vol. 5, No. 1, 86–88 (2006) {{doi| 10.1177/147041290600500107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as an "intellectual dead end".&lt;ref name=Langton&gt;Langton M. Essay: [https://www.griffithreview.com/articles/trapped-in-the-aboriginal-reality-show/ "Trapped in the aboriginal reality show"]. ''Griffith Review 2007'', 19:Re-imagining Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Australian Prime Ministers, [[Paul Keating]] (in office 1991–1996) and John Howard (in office 1996–2007), became major participants in the "wars". According to [[Mark McKenna (historian)|Mark McKenna's]] analysis for the Australian Parliamentary Library,&lt;ref name=McKenna&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/RP9798/98RP05 |title= Different Perspectives on Black Armband History |author= Mark McKenna |series= Parliamentary Library: Research Paper 5 1997-98 |publisher= The Parliament of Australia |date= November 10, 1997 |access-date= March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Howard believed that Paul Keating portrayed Australia pre-[[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] (Prime Minister from 1972 to 1975) in an unduly negative light; while Keating sought to distance the modern [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] movement from its historical support for the monarchy and for the [[White Australia policy]] by arguing that it was the conservative Australian parties which had been barriers to national progress. He accused [[United Kingdom|Britain]] of having abandoned Australia during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Keating staunchly supported a symbolic apology to [[Aboriginal Australians|Australian Aboriginals]] for their mistreatment at the hands of previous administrations, and outlined his view of the origins and potential solutions to contemporary Aboriginal disadvantage in his [[Redfern Park Speech]] of 10 December 1992 (drafted with the assistance of historian [[Don Watson]]). In 1999, following the release of the 1998 ''[[Bringing Them Home]]'' Report, Howard passed a Parliamentary [[Motion of Reconciliation]] describing treatment of Aborigines as the "most blemished chapter" in Australian history, but he refused to issue an official apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thinkingfaith.org/articles/20080221_1.htm |title= The History of Apologies Down Under &amp;#124; Thinking Faith |publisher= thinkingfaith.org |date= February 21, 2008 |access-date= March 5, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141202000730/http://www.thinkingfaith.org/articles/20080221_1.htm |archive-date= December 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard saw an apology as inappropriate as it would imply "intergeneration guilt"; he said that "practical" measures were a better response to contemporary Aboriginal disadvantage. Keating has argued for the eradication of remaining symbols linked to colonial origins: including deference for [[ANZAC Day]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/a-nation-reborn-at-anzac-cove-utter-nonsense-keating-20081030-5enw.html|title=A nation reborn at Anzac Cove?

Unlike fellow Labor leaders and contemporaries, [[Bob Hawke]] (Prime Minister 1983–1991) and [[Kim Beazley]] (Labor Party leader 2005–2006), Keating never traveled to [[Gallipoli]] for ANZAC Day ceremonies. In 2008 he described those who gathered there as "misguided".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theage.com.au/national/a-nation-reborn-at-anzac-cove-utter-nonsense-keating-20081030-5enw.html |title= A nation reborn at Anzac Cove?

In 2006 John Howard said in a speech to mark the 50th anniversary of ''Quadrant'' that [[Political correctness|"Political Correctness"]] was dead in Australia but: "we should not underestimate the degree to which the soft-left still holds sway, even dominance, especially in Australia's universities".{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} Also in 2006, [[The Sydney Morning Herald|''Sydney Morning Herald'']] political editor [[Peter Hartcher]] reported that Opposition foreign-affairs spokesman [[Kevin Rudd]] was entering the philosophical debate by arguing in response that "John Howard, is guilty of perpetrating 'a fraud' in his so-called culture wars&amp;nbsp;... designed not to make real change but to mask the damage inflicted by the Government's economic policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/pms-culture-wars-a-fraud-rudd/2006/10/27/1161749320974.html |title= PM's culture wars a fraud: Rudd - National |work= The Sydney Morning Herald |date= October 28, 2006 |access-date= April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of the Howard government in the [[2007 Australian federal election|Australian Federal election of 2007]] and its replacement by the [[First Rudd Government|Rudd Labor government]] altered the dynamic of the debate. Rudd made an [[Apology to Australia's Indigenous peoples|official apology]] to the Aboriginal ''[[Stolen Generation]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/02/12/australia.text/index.html |title= Full text of Australia's apology to Aborigines |publisher= [[CNN]] |date= February 12, 2008 |access-date= April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with bi-partisan support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/brendan-nelsons-sorry-speech/2008/02/13/1202760366050.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 |title= Brendan Nelson's sorry speech |work= The Sydney Morning Herald |date= February 13, 2008 |access-date= April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Keating, Rudd supported an Australian republic, but in contrast to Keating, Rudd declared support for the [[Australian flag]] and supported the commemoration of ANZAC Day; he also expressed admiration for Liberal Party founder [[Robert Menzies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/keating-utterly-wrong-on-gallipoli-pm/story-0-1111117908459 |title= Paul Keating 'utterly wrong' to reject Gallipoli identity, says Kevin Rudd |date= October 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/is-rudd-having-a-bob-each-way/2007/04/12/1175971263000.html |title= Is Rudd having a Bob each way? - Opinion |work= The Sydney Morning Herald |date= October 28, 2004 |access-date= April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to the 2007 change of government, and prior to the passage, with support from all parties, of the Parliamentary apology to indigenous Australians, Professor of Australian Studies Richard Nile argued: "the culture and history wars are over and with them should also go the adversarial nature of intellectual debate",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au/richardnile/index.php/theaustralian/comments/end_of_the_culture_wars |title= End of the culture wars &amp;#124; Richard Nile Blog, ''The Australian'' |publisher= blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au |date= November 28, 2007 |access-date= April 27, 2010 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100309215605/http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au/richardnile/index.php/theaustralian/comments/end_of_the_culture_wars/ |archive-date= March 9, 2010 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a view contested by others, including conservative commentator [[Janet Albrechtsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/orwellian-left-quick-to-unveil-totalitarian-heart/story-e6frg6n6-1111115088194 |title= Orwellian Left quick to unveil totalitarian heart |work= The Australian |date= December 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==

According to political scientist Constance G. Anthony, American culture war perspectives on human sexuality were exported to Africa as a form of [[neocolonialism]]. In his view, this began during the [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|AIDS epidemic in Africa]], with the United States government first tying HIV/AIDS assistance money to evangelical leadership and the [[Christian right]] during the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]], then to LGBTQ tolerance during the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|administration]] of [[Barack Obama]]. This stoked a culture war that resulted in (among others) the [[Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2014|''Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Act'']] of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anthony |first=Constance G. |date=November 2018 |title=Schizophrenic Neocolonialism: Exporting the American Culture War on Sexuality to Africa |journal=International Studies Perspectives |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=289–304 |doi=10.1093/isp/eky004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zambian scholar [[Kapya Kaoma]] notes that because "the demographic center of Christianity is shifting from the [[global North]] to the [[global South]]" Africa's influence on Christianity worldwide is increasing. American conservatives export their culture wars to Africa, Kaoma says, particularly when they realize they may be losing the battle back home. US Christians have framed their anti-LGBT initiatives in Africa as standing in opposition to a "Western [[gay agenda]]", a framing which Kaoma finds ironic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Klinken|first=Adriaan|date=2017|title=Culture Wars, Race, and Sexuality: A Nascent Pan-African LGBT-Affirming Christian Movement and the Future of Christianity|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/jafrireli.5.2.0217|journal=Journal of Africana Religions|volume=5|issue=2|pages=217-238|doi=10.5325/jafrireli.5.2.0217|archive-url=https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/105826/|archive-date=11 October 2016|access-date=May 4, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North American and European conspiracy theories have become widespread in [[West Africa]] via social media, according to 2021 survey by ''[[First Draft News]]''. [[COVID-19 misinformation]], [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]] conspiracy thinking, [[Qanon]] and other conspiracy theories associated with culture war topics are spread by American, Pro-Russian, French-language, and local disinformation websites and social media accounts, including prominent politicians in [[Nigeria]]. This has contributed to [[vaccine hesitancy]] in West Africa, with 60 percent of survey respondents saying they were unlikely to try to get vaccinated, and an erosion of trust in institutions in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |first1=Carlotta |last1=Dotto |first2=Seb |last2=Cubbon |date=June 23, 2021 |title=Disinformation exports: How foreign anti-vaccine narratives reached West African communities online |url=https://firstdraftnews.org/long-form-article/foreign-anti-vaccine-disinformation-reaches-west-africa/ |publisher=First Draft News |access-date=June 23, 2021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
