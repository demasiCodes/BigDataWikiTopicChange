The '''culture war''' or '''culture conflict''' refers to the conflict between [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] or [[conservative]] values and [[social democracy]], [[Progressivism|progressive]] or [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] values in the Western world, as well as other countries.  Beginning in the 1990s, culture wars have influenced the debate over public school history and science curricula in the United States, along with many other issues.

The expression ''culture war'' entered the vocabulary of United States politics with the publication of ''[[Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America]]'' by [[James Davison Hunter]] in 1991. Hunter perceived a dramatic realignment and polarization that had transformed [[politics of the United States|United States politics]] and [[culture of the United States|culture]], including the issues of [[abortion]], [[Gun law in the United States|federal]] and [[Gun laws in the United States by state|state gun laws]], [[global warming]], [[immigration]], [[separation of church and state]], [[privacy]], [[recreational drug use]], [[LGBT]], and [[censorship]].

In [[Canada]], ''culture war'' refers to differing values between [[Western Canada|Western]] versus [[Eastern Canada]], [[List of the 100 largest population centres in Canada|urban]] versus [[rural Canada]], as well as [[Conservatism in Canada|conservatism]] versus [[Liberalism in Canada|liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Gerald|last=Caplan |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/second-reading/culture-clash-splits-canadians-over-basic-values/article4626123/ |location=Toronto|work=The Globe and Mail |title=Culture clash splits Canadians over basic values |date=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Kladderadatsch 1875 - Zwischen Berlin und Rom.png|thumb|200px|Bismarck (left) and the Pope, from the German satirical magazine ''[[Kladderadatsch]]'', 1875.]]
The phrase "culture war" represents a loan translation ([[calque]]) from the German ''[[Kulturkampf]]''. The German word ''Kulturkampf'' (culture struggle), refers to the clash between cultural and religious groups in the campaign from 1871 to 1878 under [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] of the [[German Empire]] against the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Kulturkampf |encyclopedia=[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]] |year=1910 |publisher=[[Robert Appleton Company]] |location=New York |volume=8 |accessdate=March 27, 2015 |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08703b.htm |last=Spahn |first=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States of America==
{{further information|Ethnocultural politics in the United States}}
In American usage the term ''culture war'' may imply a conflict between those values considered [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] or [[Conservativism in the United States|conservative]] and those considered [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] or [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]. It originated in the 1920s when urban and rural American values came into clear conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.assumption.edu/users/McClymer/his394/ |title=Seminar on the Culture Wars of the 1920s |date=Fall 2001 |accessdate=March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This followed several decades of immigration to the States by people who earlier European immigrants considered "alien". It was also a result of the cultural shifts and modernizing trends of the [[Roaring 20s]], culminating in the presidential campaign of [[Al Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/03/reclaiming_faith_and_politics.html |title= Culture Wars: How 2004 |last=Dionne |first=E. J. |authorlink=E. J. Dionne}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1928. However, [[James Davison Hunter]]'s 1991 book ''Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America'' redefined the "culture war" in the United States of America.  Hunter traces the concept to the 1960s.&lt;ref name=CultStrat&gt;{{cite book |last=Holt |first=Douglas |last2= Cameron |first2=Douglas |year=2010 |title= Cultural Strategy |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn= 978-0-19-958740-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perceived focus of the American culture war and its definition have taken various forms since then.&lt;ref name="Andrew Hartman 2015"&gt;Andrew Hartman, ''A War for the Soul of America: A History of the Culture Wars'' (University of Chicago Press, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
[[James Davison Hunter]], a [[sociologist]] at the [[University of Virginia]], introduced the expression again in his 1991 publication, ''Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America''. Hunter described what he saw as a dramatic realignment and polarization that had transformed [[politics of the United States|American politics]] and [[American culture|culture]].

He argued that on an increasing number of "hot-button" defining issues—[[abortion]], [[gun politics]], [[separation of church and state]], [[privacy]], [[recreational drug use]], [[homosexuality]], [[censorship]]—there existed two definable polarities. Furthermore, not only were there a number of divisive issues, but society had divided along essentially the same lines on these issues, so as to constitute two warring groups, defined primarily not by nominal religion, ethnicity, social class, or even political affiliation, but rather by ideological [[world-view]]s.

Hunter characterized this polarity as stemming from opposite impulses, toward what he referred to as ''Progressivism'' and as ''Orthodoxy''. Others have adopted the dichotomy with varying labels. For example, [[Fox News]] commentator [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] emphasizes differences between "Secular-Progressives" and "Traditionalists".

[[File:Patrickjbuchanan.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Patrick Buchanan in 2008.]]

In 1990, commentator [[Pat Buchanan]] mounted a campaign for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination for President against incumbent [[George H. W. Bush]] in [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]]. He received a prime-time speech-slot at the [[1992 Republican National Convention]], to give his speech on the culture war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote=Not since Pat Buchanan's famous "culture war" speech in 1992 has a major speaker at a national political convention spoken so hatefully, at such length, about the opposition. |title=Dogs of War |url=http://www.newdonkey.com/2004/09/dogs-of-war.html |deadurl=yes |publisher=New Donkey |date=September 2, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308043424/http://www.newdonkey.com/2004/09/dogs-of-war.html |archivedate=March 8, 2005 |accessdate=August 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued: "There is a religious war going on in our country for the soul of America. It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we will one day be as was the Cold War itself."&lt;ref name="1992-GOP"&gt;{{Cite speech |authorlink=Patrick Buchanan |first=Patrick |last=Buchanan |title=1992 Republican National Convention Speech |date=August 17, 1992 |url=http://buchanan.org/blog/1992-republican-national-convention-speech-148 |accessdate=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to criticizing environmentalists and feminism, he portrayed [[public morality]] as a [[defining issue]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The agenda [Bill] Clinton and [Hillary] Clinton would impose on America—abortion on demand, a [[Litmus test (politics)|litmus test]] for the Supreme Court, homosexual rights, discrimination against religious schools, women in combat units—that's change, all right. But it is not the kind of change America wants. It is not the kind of change America needs. And it is not the kind of change we can tolerate in a nation that we still call God's country."&lt;ref name="1992-GOP" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A month later, Buchanan characterized the conflict as about power over society's definition of right and wrong. He named abortion, sexual orientation and popular culture as major fronts—and mentioned other controversies, including clashes over the [[Confederate Flag]], Christmas and taxpayer-funded art. He also said that the negative attention his "culture war" speech received was itself evidence of America's polarization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buchanan.org/blog/the-cultural-war-for-the-soul-of-america-149 |title=The Cultural War for the Soul of America |last=Buchanan |first=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick Buchanan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Culture war had significant impact on national politics in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Andrew Hartman 2015" /&gt; The rhetoric of the [[Christian Coalition of America]] may have weakened president [[George H.W. Bush]]'s chances for reelection in 1992 and helped his successor, [[Bill Clinton]], win reelection in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chapman |first=Roger |title=Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints, and Voices |year=2010 |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |location=Armonk, NY |isbn=978-0-7656-1761-3 |page=88 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vRY27FkGJAUC&amp;pg=PA88}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the rhetoric of conservative cultural warriors helped Republicans gain control of Congress in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chapman |first=Roger |title=Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints, and Voices |year=2010 |publisher=M.E.

The culture wars influenced the debate over state-school history curricula in the United States in the 1990s. In particular, debates over the development of national educational standards in 1994 revolved around whether the study of American history should be a "celebratory" or "critical" undertaking and involved such prominent public figures as [[Lynne Cheney]], [[Rush Limbaugh]], and historian [[Gary Nash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{google book |title=Who Owns History: Rethinking the Past in a Changing World |last=Foner |first=Eric |id=H3I-Z8KW5REC |location=New York |publisher=Hill &amp; Wang |year=2002 |isbn=1-4299-2392-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{google book |title=History on Trial: Culture Wars and the Teaching of the Past |last1=Nash |first1=Gary B. |authorlink1=Gary B.

===2000s===

In a February 2009 column in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[William Saletan]] stated that a holistic mix of left-wing and right-wing ideas would come out of the culture war. He wrote: "morality has to be practical, and that practicality requires morals." He concluded that conservatives should embrace [[family planning]] as a way to reduce abortion and government assistance while liberals should embrace personal responsibility, which means that unprotected sex is criticized "bluntly." He also advocated same-sex marriage as a way to lead [[LGBT in the United States|LGBT Americans]] to an "ethic of mutual support and sacrifice" involving stricter personal responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;

Interpretations of Aboriginal history became part of the wider political debate sometimes called the ''[[#History wars and culture wars|'culture wars']]'' during the tenure of the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] government from 1996–2007, with the [[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[John Howard]] publicly championing the views of some of those associated with ''Quadrant''.&lt;ref name="Manne11/08"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2008/november/1277253191/robert-manne/what-rudd-s-agenda |last=Manne |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Manne |title=What is Rudd’s Agenda? |work=[[The Monthly]] |date=November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This debate extended into a [[#National Museum of Australia controversy|controversy]] over the way history was presented in the [[National Museum of Australia]] and in [[high school]] history curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rundle |first=Guy |url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2007/06/28/1915-and-all-that-history-in-a-holding-pattern/ |title=1915 and all that: History in a holding pattern |work=Crikey |date=June 28, 2007 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ferrari |first=Justine&lt;!--Education writer--&gt; |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24492542-13881,00.html |title=History curriculum author defies his critics to find bias |work=The Australian |date=October 14, 2008 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also migrated into the general Australian media, with regular opinion pieces being published in major [[broadsheet]]s such as ''[[The Australian]]'', ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]''. [[Marcia Langton]] has referred to much of this wider debate as 'war porn'&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard J. War porn. ''Journal of Visual Culture'', Vol. 5, No. 1, 86-88 (2006) {{doi|10.1177/147041290600500107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an 'intellectual dead end'&lt;ref name=Langton&gt;Langton M. Essay: Trapped in the aboriginal reality show. ''Griffith Review 2007'', 19:Re-imagining Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Australian Prime Ministers, Paul Keating and John Howard, were major participants in the "wars". According to the analysis for the Australian Parliamentary Library of Dr Mark McKenna,&lt;ref name=McKenna&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/RP9798/98RP05 |title=Different Perspectives on Black Armband History |author=Dr. Mark McKenna |series=Parliamentary Library: Research Paper 5 1997-98 |publisher=The Parliament of Australia |date=November 10, 1997 |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Keating]] (1991–1996) was believed by [[John Howard]] (1996–2007) to portray Australia pre-[[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] in an unduly negative light; while Keating sought to distance the modern [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] movement from its historical support for the Monarchy and the [[White Australia policy]] by arguing that it was the Conservative Australian Parties who had been barriers to national progress and excessively loyal to the British Empire. He accused Britain of having abandoned Australia during World War II. Keating was a staunch advocate of a symbolic apology to indigenous people for the misdeeds of past governments, and outlined his view of the origins and potential solutions to contemporary Aboriginal disadvantage in his [[Redfern Park Speech]] (drafted with the assistance of historian [[Don Watson]]). In 1999, following the release of the 1998 [[Bringing Them Home]] Report, Howard passed a Parliamentary [[Motion of Reconciliation]] describing treatment of Aborigines as the "most blemished chapter" in Australian history, but he did not make a Parliamentary apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thinkingfaith.org/articles/20080221_1.htm |title=The History of Apologies Down Under &amp;#124; Thinking Faith |publisher=thinkingfaith.org |date=February 21, 2008 |accessdate=March 5, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202000730/http://www.thinkingfaith.org/articles/20080221_1.htm |archivedate=December 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard argued that an apology was inappropriate as it would imply "intergeneration guilt" and said that "practical" measures were a better response to contemporary Aboriginal disadvantage. Keating has argued for the eradication of remaining symbols linked to British origins: including deference for [[ANZAC Day]], the [[Australian Flag]] and the [[Monarchy in Australia]], while Howard was a supporter of these institutions. Unlike fellow Labor leaders and contemporaries, [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Kim Beazley]], Keating never traveled to [[Gallipoli]] for ANZAC Day ceremonies. In 2008 he described those who gathered there as "misguided".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/a-nation-reborn-at-anzac-cove-utter-nonsense-keating-20081030-5enw.html |title=A nation reborn at Anzac Cove?

In 2006, John Howard said in a speech to mark the 50th anniversary of ''Quadrant'' that "Political Correctness" was dead in Australia but: "we should not underestimate the degree to which the soft-left still holds sway, even dominance, especially in Australia's universities"; and in 2006, [[Sydney Morning Herald]] Political Editor [[Peter Hartcher]] reported that Opposition foreign affairs spokesman [[Kevin Rudd]] was entering the philosophical debate by arguing in response that "John Howard, is guilty of perpetrating 'a fraud' in his so-called culture wars... designed not to make real change but to mask the damage inflicted by the Government's economic policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/pms-culture-wars-a-fraud-rudd/2006/10/27/1161749320974.html |title=PM's culture wars a fraud: Rudd - National |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=October 28, 2006 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of the Howard government in the Australian Federal election of 2007, and its replacement by the [[First Rudd Government|Rudd Labor government]] has altered the dynamic of the debate. Rudd made an official apology to the ''[[Stolen Generation]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/02/12/australia.text/index.html |title=Full text of Australia's apology to Aborigines |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=February 12, 2008 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with bi-partisan support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/brendan-nelsons-sorry-speech/2008/02/13/1202760366050.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 |title=Brendan Nelson's sorry speech |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=February 13, 2008 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Keating, Rudd supports an Australian Republic, but in contrast to Keating, Rudd has declared support for the [[Australian flag]] and supports the commemoration of [[ANZAC Day]] and expressed admiration for Liberal Party founder [[Robert Menzies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/keating-utterly-wrong-on-gallipoli-pm/story-0-1111117908459 |title=Paul Keating 'utterly wrong' to reject Gallipoli identity, says Kevin Rudd |date=October 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/is-rudd-having-a-bob-each-way/2007/04/12/1175971263000.html |title=Is Rudd having a Bob each way? - Opinion |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=October 28, 2004 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the change of government, and the passage, with support from all parties, of a Parliamentary apology to indigenous Australians, Professor of Australian Studies Richard Nile has argued: "the culture and history wars are over and with them should also go the adversarial nature of intellectual debate",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au/richardnile/index.php/theaustralian/comments/end_of_the_culture_wars |title=End of the culture wars &amp;#124; Richard Nile Blog, ''The Australian'' |publisher=blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au |date=November 28, 2007 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a view contested by others, including conservative commentator [[Janet Albrechtsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/orwellian-left-quick-to-unveil-totalitarian-heart/story-e6frg6n6-1111115088194 |title=Orwellian Left quick to unveil totalitarian heart |work=The Australian |date=December 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; An intention to reengage in the history wars has been indicated by the Federal Opposition's [[Christopher Pyne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?&amp;docID=SMH130427114V71OBPNC Julia Baird, (April 27, 2013), Don't dismiss nation's blemishes ''Sydney Morning Herald'', Sydney, p. 12]&lt;/ref&gt;
