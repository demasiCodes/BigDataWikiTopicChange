'''Culture war''' is the [[cultural conflict]] between social groups and the struggle for [[Dominant culture|dominance]] of their [[Value (ethics)|values]], beliefs, and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/culture-war|title=Culture war|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Dictionary.com]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It commonly refers to the hot button topics on which there is general societal disagreement and [[Political polarization|polarization]] in societal values is seen.

The term is commonly used to describe contemporary politics in the United States,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; with issues such as [[abortion]], [[homosexuality]], [[pornography]], [[multiculturalism]], and other cultural conflicts based on values, [[morality]], and [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] being described as the major political cleavage.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/legal-and-political-magazines/culture-wars|title=Culture Wars|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Encyclopedia.com]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Origins==
[[File:Kladderadatsch 1875 - Zwischen Berlin und Rom.png|thumb|200px|Bismarck (left) and the Pope, from the German satirical magazine ''[[Kladderadatsch]]'', 1875]]
The phrase "culture war" represents a loan translation ([[calque]]) from the German ''[[Kulturkampf]]''. The German word ''Kulturkampf'' (culture struggle) refers to the clash between cultural and religious groups in the campaign from 1871 to 1878 under [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] of the [[German Empire]] against the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Kulturkampf |encyclopedia=[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]] |year=1910 |publisher=[[Robert Appleton Company]] |location=New York |volume=8 |accessdate=March 27, 2015 |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08703b.htm |last=Spahn |first=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The translation was printed in some American newspapers at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/clip/29456963/prosecution_of_priests_culture_war/|title=Prosecution of priests (Culture War reference) (1874)|website=Newspapers.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{further information|Ethnocultural politics in the United States}}

The expression "culture war" was published occasionally in American newspapers during the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/clip/29457081/what_bismarck_could_not_do_culture_war/|title=What Bismarck could not do (Culture War reference) (1906)|website=Newspapers.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/clip/29456609/culture_war_to_be_theme_of_talk_1942/|title="Culture War" to be theme of talk (1942)|website=Newspapers.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; but only joined the vocabulary of United States politics with the publication of ''[[Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America]]'' by [[James Davison Hunter]] in 1991. Hunter perceived a dramatic realignment and polarization that had transformed [[politics of the United States|United States politics]] and [[culture of the United States|culture]], including the issues of [[abortion]], [[Gun law in the United States|federal]] and [[Gun laws in the United States by state|state gun laws]], [[global warming]], [[immigration]], [[separation of church and state]], [[Privacy laws of the United States|privacy]], [[recreational drug use]], [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]], and [[censorship]].

In American usage the term "culture war" may imply a conflict between those values considered [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] or [[Conservativism in the United States|conservative]] and those considered [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] or [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]. It originated in the 1920s when urban and rural American values came into clear conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.assumption.edu/users/McClymer/his394/ |title=Seminar on the Culture Wars of the 1920s |date=Fall 2001 |accessdate=March 27, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527011107/http://www1.assumption.edu/users/mcclymer/his394/ |archive-date=May 27, 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This followed several decades of immigration to the States by people who earlier European immigrants considered "alien". It was also a result of the cultural shifts and modernizing trends of the [[Roaring 20s]], culminating in the presidential campaign of [[Al Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/03/reclaiming_faith_and_politics.html |title= Culture Wars: How 2004 |last=Dionne |first=E. J. |authorlink=E. J. Dionne}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1928. However, [[James Davison Hunter]]'s 1991 book ''Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America'' redefined the "culture war" in the United States of America.  Hunter traces the concept to the 1960s.&lt;ref name=CultStrat&gt;{{cite book |last=Holt |first=Douglas |last2= Cameron |first2=Douglas |year=2010 |title= Cultural Strategy |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn= 978-0-19-958740-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perceived focus of the American culture war and its definition have taken various forms since then.&lt;ref name="Andrew Hartman 2015"&gt;Andrew Hartman, ''A War for the Soul of America: A History of the Culture Wars'' (University of Chicago Press, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
[[James Davison Hunter]], a [[sociologist]] at the [[University of Virginia]], introduced the expression again in his 1991 publication, ''Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America''. Hunter described what he saw as a dramatic realignment and polarization that had transformed [[politics of the United States|American politics]] and [[American culture|culture]].

He argued that on an increasing number of "hot-button" defining issues—[[abortion]], [[gun politics]], [[separation of church and state]], [[privacy]], [[recreational drug use]], [[homosexuality]], [[censorship]]—there existed two definable polarities. Furthermore, not only were there a number of divisive issues, but society had divided along essentially the same lines on these issues, so as to constitute two warring groups, defined primarily not by nominal religion, ethnicity, social class, or even political affiliation, but rather by ideological [[world-view]]s.

Hunter characterized this polarity as stemming from opposite impulses, toward what he referred to as ''Progressivism'' and as ''Orthodoxy''. Others have adopted the dichotomy with varying labels. For example, [[Fox News]] commentator [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] emphasizes differences between "Secular-Progressives" and "Traditionalists".

[[File:Patrickjbuchanan.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Patrick Buchanan in 2008]]

During the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential election]], commentator [[Pat Buchanan]] mounted a campaign for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination for President against incumbent [[George H. W. Bush]]. In a prime-time slot at the [[1992 Republican National Convention]], Buchanan gave his speech on the culture war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote=Not since Pat Buchanan's famous 'culture war' speech in 1992 has a major speaker at a national political convention spoken so hatefully, at such length, about the opposition. |title=Dogs of War |url=http://www.newdonkey.com/2004/09/dogs-of-war.html |url-status=dead |publisher=New Donkey |date=September 2, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308043424/http://www.newdonkey.com/2004/09/dogs-of-war.html |archivedate=March 8, 2005 |accessdate=August 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued: "There is a religious war going on in our country for the soul of America. It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we will one day be as was the Cold War itself."&lt;ref name="1992-GOP"&gt;{{Cite speech |authorlink=Patrick Buchanan |first=Patrick |last=Buchanan |title=1992 Republican National Convention Speech |date=August 17, 1992 |url=http://buchanan.org/blog/1992-republican-national-convention-speech-148 |accessdate=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to criticizing environmentalists and feminism, he portrayed [[public morality]] as a [[defining issue]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The agenda [Bill] Clinton and [Hillary] Clinton would impose on America—abortion on demand, a [[Litmus test (politics)|litmus test]] for the Supreme Court, homosexual rights, discrimination against religious schools, women in combat units—that's change, all right. But it is not the kind of change America wants. It is not the kind of change America needs. And it is not the kind of change we can tolerate in a nation that we still call God's country.&lt;ref name="1992-GOP" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A month later, Buchanan characterized the conflict as about power over society's definition of right and wrong. He named abortion, sexual orientation and popular culture as major fronts—and mentioned other controversies, including clashes over the [[Confederate flag]], Christmas and taxpayer-funded art. He also said that the negative attention his "culture war" speech received was itself evidence of America's polarization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buchanan.org/blog/the-cultural-war-for-the-soul-of-america-149 |title=The Cultural War for the Soul of America |last=Buchanan |first=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick Buchanan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The culture war had significant impact on national politics in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Andrew Hartman 2015" /&gt; The rhetoric of the [[Christian Coalition of America]] may have weakened president George H. W. Bush's chances for reelection in 1992 and helped his successor, [[Bill Clinton]], win reelection in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chapman |first=Roger |title=Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints, and Voices |year=2010 |publisher=M.

The culture wars influenced the debate over state-school history curricula in the United States in the 1990s. In particular, debates over the development of national educational standards in 1994 revolved around whether the study of American history should be a "celebratory" or "critical" undertaking and involved such prominent public figures as [[Lynne Cheney]], [[Rush Limbaugh]], and historian [[Gary Nash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{google book |title=Who Owns History: Rethinking the Past in a Changing World |last=Foner |first=Eric |id=H3I-Z8KW5REC |location=New York |publisher=Hill &amp; Wang |year=2002 |isbn=1-4299-2392-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{google book |title=History on Trial: Culture Wars and the Teaching of the Past |last1=Nash |first1=Gary B. |authorlink1=Gary B.

A worldview called [[neo-conservatism]] shifted the terms of the debate in the early 2000s.  Neo-conservatives differed from their opponents in that they interpreted problems facing the nation as moral issues rather than economic or political issues. For example, neo-conservatives saw the decline of the traditional family structure as a spiritual crisis that required a spiritual response. Critics accused neo-conservatives of [[Correlation does not imply causation|confusing cause and effect]].&lt;ref&gt; Zafirovski, Milan.

{{Hatnote|See: [[Battle of Alberta]] and [[Battle of Ontario]]}}
In [[Canada]], "culture war" refers to differing values between [[Western Canada|Western]] versus [[Eastern Canada]], [[List of the 100 largest population centres in Canada|urban]] versus [[rural Canada]], as well as [[Conservatism in Canada|conservatism]] versus [[Liberalism in Canada|liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Gerald|last=Caplan |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/second-reading/culture-clash-splits-canadians-over-basic-values/article4626123/ |location=Toronto|work=The Globe and Mail |title=Culture clash splits Canadians over basic values |date=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A divide between [[Francophone|French]] and [[Anglophone|English]] is also a consistent part of Canadian society.

The phrase "culture war" (or "culture wars") in Canada describes the [[political polarization|polarization]] between the different values of Canadians.{{cn|date=April 2017}} This can be [[Western Canada|West]] versus [[Eastern Canada|East]], [[Rural Canada|rural]] versus [[List of the 100 largest urban areas in Canada by population|urban]], or [[Conservatism in Canada|traditional values]] versus [[Progressivism in Canada|progressive values]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/second-reading/culture-clash-splits-canadians-over-basic-values/article4626123/ |location= Toronto |work= The Globe and Mail |title= Culture clash splits Canadians over basic values |date= October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification | reason = No example of "culture war(s)" in a Canadian context|date=April 2017}} "Culture war" is a relatively new phrase in Canadian political commentary.

{{Main article|History wars}}
Interpretations of [[Aboriginal Australians | Aboriginal]] history became part of the wider political debate sometimes called the "[[History wars#History wars and culture wars|culture wars]]" during the tenure of the [[Coalition (Australia)| Liberal–National Coalition]] government of 1996 to 2007, with the [[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[John Howard]] publicly championing the views of some of those associated with [[Quadrant (magazine) | ''Quadrant'']].&lt;ref name="Manne11/08"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2008/november/1277253191/robert-manne/what-rudd-s-agenda |last= Manne |first= Robert |authorlink= Robert Manne |title= What is Rudd's Agenda? |work= [[The Monthly]] |date= November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This debate extended into [[#National Museum of Australia controversy|a controversy]] over the presentation of history in the [[National Museum of Australia]] and in [[Education in Australia | high-school]] history curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Rundle |first= Guy |url= http://www.crikey.com.au/2007/06/28/1915-and-all-that-history-in-a-holding-pattern/ |title= 1915 and all that: History in a holding pattern |work= Crikey |date= June 28, 2007 |accessdate= April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Ferrari |first= Justine&lt;!--Education writer--&gt; |url= http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24492542-13881,00.html |title= History curriculum author defies his critics to find bias |work= The Australian |date= October 14, 2008 |accessdate= April 27, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091006084757/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24492542-13881,00.html |archive-date= October 6, 2009 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also migrated into the general Australian media, with major broadsheets such as ''[[The Australian]]'', ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]'' regularly publishing opinion pieces on the topic. [[Marcia Langton]] has referred to much of this wider debate as "war porn"&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard J. War porn. ''Journal of Visual Culture'', Vol. 5, No. 1, 86–88 (2006) {{doi| 10.1177/147041290600500107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as an "intellectual dead end".&lt;ref name=Langton&gt;Langton M. Essay: Trapped in the aboriginal reality show. ''Griffith Review 2007'', 19:Re-imagining Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Australian Prime Ministers, [[Paul Keating]] (in office 1991–1996) and John Howard (in office 1996–2007), became major participants in the "wars". According to Mark McKenna's analysis for the Australian Parliamentary Library,&lt;ref name=McKenna&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/RP9798/98RP05 |title= Different Perspectives on Black Armband History |author= Mark McKenna |series= Parliamentary Library: Research Paper 5 1997-98 |publisher= The Parliament of Australia |date= November 10, 1997 |accessdate= March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Howard believed that Paul Keating portrayed Australia pre-[[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] (Prime Minister from 1972 to 1975) in an unduly negative light; while Keating sought to distance the modern [[Australian Labor Party| Labor]] movement from its historical support for the monarchy and for the [[White Australia policy]] by arguing that it was the conservative Australian parties which had been barriers to national progress and excessively loyal to the [[British Empire]]. He accused Britain of having abandoned Australia during [[World War II]] (1939–1945). Keating staunchly supported a symbolic apology to [[Indigenous Australians | indigenous people]] for the misdeeds of past governments, and outlined his view of the origins and potential solutions to contemporary Aboriginal disadvantage in his [[Redfern Park Speech]] of 10 December 1992 (drafted with the assistance of historian [[Don Watson]]). In 1999, following the release of the 1998 ''[[Bringing Them Home]]'' Report, Howard passed a Parliamentary [[Motion of Reconciliation]] describing treatment of Aborigines as the "most blemished chapter" in Australian history, but he did not make a Parliamentary apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thinkingfaith.org/articles/20080221_1.htm |title= The History of Apologies Down Under &amp;#124; Thinking Faith |publisher= thinkingfaith.org |date= February 21, 2008 |accessdate= March 5, 2015 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141202000730/http://www.thinkingfaith.org/articles/20080221_1.htm |archivedate= December 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard saw an apology as inappropriate as it would imply "intergeneration guilt"; he said that "practical" measures were a better response to contemporary Aboriginal disadvantage. Keating has argued for the eradication of remaining symbols linked to British origins: including deference for [[ANZAC Day]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.smh.com.au/national/a-nation-reborn-at-anzac-cove-utter-nonsense-keating-20081030-5enw.html&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[Australian flag]] and for the [[monarchy in Australia]], while Howard supported these institutions. Unlike fellow Labor leaders and contemporaries, [[Bob Hawke]] (Prime Minister 1983–1991) and [[Kim Beazley]] (Labor Party leader 2005–2006), Keating never traveled to [[Gallipoli]] for ANZAC Day ceremonies. In 2008 he described those who gathered there as "misguided".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theage.com.au/national/a-nation-reborn-at-anzac-cove-utter-nonsense-keating-20081030-5enw.html |title= A nation reborn at Anzac Cove?

In 2006 John Howard said in a speech to mark the 50th anniversary of ''Quadrant'' that [[Political correctness | "Political Correctness"]] was dead in Australia but: "we should not underestimate the degree to which the soft-left still holds sway, even dominance, especially in Australia's universities".{{cn|date=December 2018}} Also in 2006, [[The Sydney Morning Herald | ''Sydney Morning Herald'']] political editor [[Peter Hartcher]] reported that Opposition foreign-affairs spokesman [[Kevin Rudd]] was entering the philosophical debate by arguing in response that "John Howard, is guilty of perpetrating 'a fraud' in his so-called culture wars&amp;nbsp;... designed not to make real change but to mask the damage inflicted by the Government's economic policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/pms-culture-wars-a-fraud-rudd/2006/10/27/1161749320974.html |title= PM's culture wars a fraud: Rudd - National |work= The Sydney Morning Herald |date= October 28, 2006 |accessdate= April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of the Howard government in the [[2007 Australian federal election | Australian Federal election of 2007]] and its replacement by the [[First Rudd Government |Rudd Labor government]] altered the dynamic of the debate. Rudd made an [[Apology to Australia's Indigenous peoples | official apology]] to the Aboriginal ''[[Stolen Generation]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/02/12/australia.text/index.html |title= Full text of Australia's apology to Aborigines |publisher= [[CNN]] |date= February 12, 2008 |accessdate= April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with bi-partisan support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/brendan-nelsons-sorry-speech/2008/02/13/1202760366050.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 |title= Brendan Nelson's sorry speech |work= The Sydney Morning Herald |date= February 13, 2008 |accessdate= April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Keating, Rudd supported an Australian republic, but in contrast to Keating, Rudd declared support for the [[Australian flag]] and supported the commemoration of ANZAC Day; he also expressed admiration for Liberal Party founder [[Robert Menzies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/keating-utterly-wrong-on-gallipoli-pm/story-0-1111117908459 |title= Paul Keating 'utterly wrong' to reject Gallipoli identity, says Kevin Rudd |date= October 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/is-rudd-having-a-bob-each-way/2007/04/12/1175971263000.html |title= Is Rudd having a Bob each way? - Opinion |work= The Sydney Morning Herald |date= October 28, 2004 |accessdate= April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to the 2007 change of government, and prior to the passage, with support from all parties, of the Parliamentary apology to indigenous Australians, Professor of Australian Studies Richard Nile argued: "the culture and history wars are over and with them should also go the adversarial nature of intellectual debate",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au/richardnile/index.php/theaustralian/comments/end_of_the_culture_wars |title= End of the culture wars &amp;#124; Richard Nile Blog, ''The Australian'' |publisher= blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au |date= November 28, 2007 |accessdate= April 27, 2010 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100309215605/http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au/richardnile/index.php/theaustralian/comments/end_of_the_culture_wars/ |archivedate= March 9, 2010 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a view contested by others, including conservative commentator [[Janet Albrechtsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/orwellian-left-quick-to-unveil-totalitarian-heart/story-e6frg6n6-1111115088194 |title= Orwellian Left quick to unveil totalitarian heart |work= The Australian |date= December 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Liberal Party parliamentarian [[Christopher Pyne]] indicated{{when?|date=December 2018}} an intention to re-engage in the history wars.&lt;ref&gt;
