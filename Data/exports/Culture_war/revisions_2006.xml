The term evokes the 19th-century German ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' (where [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] and the German Protestant government attacked the legal rights of Catholics.) [[Paleoconservatism|Paleoconservative]] [[Pat Buchanan]] used the term often, and in one speech, compared it to the [[Cold War]] between the United States and the Soviet Union.

== Gramsci's theory of hegemony ==
The concept of culture war was built on by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Antonio Gramsci]]. Gramsci argued that the reason [[proletarian revolution]] had not advanced as fast as many Marxists thought it would was because of [[cultural hegemony]]. The theory of cultural hegemony states that a diverse culture can be dominated by one class because of that class's monopoly over the [[Mass media]] and [[popular culture]]. Gramsci therefore argued for a culture war in which [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] elements seek to gain a dominant voice in mass media, education, and other mass organizations.

==James Davison Hunter==
The expression gained wide use with the 1991 publication of ''Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America'' by [[James Davison Hunter]]. In that book, Hunter described what he saw as a dramatic re-alignment and polarization that had transformed [[politics of the United States|American politics]] and [[American culture|culture]]. 

He argued that on an increasing number of "hot-button" defining issues&amp;mdash;[[abortion]], [[gun politics]], [[separation of church and state]], [[privacy]], [[homosexuality]], [[censorship]] issues&amp;mdash; there had come to be two definable polarities. Furthermore, it was not just that there were a number of divisive issues, but that society had divided along essentially the same lines on each of these issues, so as to constitute two warring groups, defined primarily not by nominal religion, ethnicity, social class, or even political affiliation, but rather by ideological [[world view]]s. 

Hunter characterised this polarity as stemming from opposite impulses, toward what he refers to as ''Progressivism'' and ''Orthodoxy''. The dichotomy has been adopted with varying labels, including, for example, by commentator [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] who emphasizes differences between "Secular-Progressives" and "Traditionalists".

==Pat Buchanan==

During the same period, [[paleoconservatism|paleoconservative]] commentator [[Pat Buchanan]] mounted a campaign for the [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] nomination for [[president of the United States]] against incumbent [[George H.W. Bush]] in 1992. After doing surprisingly well in the [[New Hampshire Primary]], where he drew 37% of the vote, his campaign faded. He received a prime time speech slot on the opening night of the [[Republican National Convention]]. His keynote is sometimes dubbed the "'''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'culture war' speech'''".&lt;ref&gt;
''"Not since Pat Buchanan's famous "culture war" speech in 1992 has a major speaker at a national political convention spoken so hatefully, at such length, about the opposition."''&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

During his speech, he said:  "There is a religious war going on in our country for the soul of America. It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we will one day be as was the Cold War" itself."[http://www.buchanan.org/pa-92-0817-rnc.html]  In addition to criticizing "environmental extremists" and "radical feminism," he said [[public morality]] was a [[defining issue]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The agenda [Bill] Clinton and [Hillary] Clinton would impose on America--abortion on demand, a litmus test for the Supreme Court, homosexual rights, discrimination against religious schools, women in combat--that's change, all right. But it is not the kind of change America wants. It is not the kind of change America needs. And it is not the kind of change we can tolerate in a nation that we still call God's country.[http://www.buchanan.org/pa-92-0817-rnc.html]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A month later, Buchanan elaborated that this conflict was about power over society's definition of right and wrong.  He named abortion, sexual preference and popular culture as major fronts – and mentioned other controversies,  including clashes over the [[Confederate Flag]], Christmas and taxpayer-funded art.  He also said that the negative attention his talk of a culture war received was itself evidence of America’s polarization.[http://www.buchanan.org/pa-92-0914.html]

When Buchanan ran for president in 1996, he promised to fight for the conservative side of the culture war:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I will use the bully pulpit of the Presidency of the United States, to the full extent of my power and ability, to defend American traditions and the values of faith, family, and country, from any and all directions. And, together, we will chase the purveyors of sex and violence back beneath the rocks whence they came.[http://www.4president.org/speeches/buchanan1996announcement.htm]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 2004 column, Buchanan said the culture war had reignited and that Americans no longer inhabited the same moral universe.  He gave such examples as gay civil unions, the "crudity of the MTV crowd," and the controversy surrounding [[Mel Gibson|Mel Gibson's]] film, [[Passion of the Christ]].   He wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Who is in your face here? Who started this? Who is on the offensive? Who is pushing the envelope? The answer is obvious. A radical Left aided by a cultural elite that detests Christianity and finds Christian moral tenets reactionary and repressive is hell-bent on pushing its amoral values and imposing its ideology on our nation.
The unwisdom of what the Hollywood and the Left are about should be transparent to all.[http://www.theamericancause.org/patculturewars.htm]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Campus culture wars==

From the point of view of American [[academia]], the "culture wars" and their alignments were nothing new &amp;mdash; rather, they were perceived as an extrapolation of some conflicts that had been simmering in university life since the [[1960s]]. Positions had been taken up on a number of issues: alleged [[ethnocentricity]] of traditional studies such as philosophy and literature; [[feminism]]; [[postmodernism]]; and [[homosexuality]] as a topic in the [[humanities]]. Cruder debates in more emotive terms were expected on the [[curriculum]], [[popular culture]], [[political correctness]], [[affirmative action]] as it applies to admissions, and allegations that teaching was too centred on so called "[[dead white males]]." 

The campus culture wars reflected a change in the demographics of the student population, as well as social change in society at large. [[Public intellectual]]s have sometimes been content to blur the distinction between "culture war" in this sense, and in national politics.

The 1992 book ''Beyond the Culture Wars: How Teaching the Conflicts Can Revitalize American Education'' by [[Gerald Graff]] took a positive line on the campus culture wars.

==After 9/11==

The idea that the events of 9-11 might have ended the culture wars, however, became less tenable after the 2004 presidential election. Debates and controversy over "hot button" culture wars issues of the 1980s and 1990s seemed more polarized than ever. The red state/blue state electoral divide showed the country very evenly split.&lt;ref&gt;''Time'' Sept 11, 2006, pp 31-54&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators and others were surprised by [[exit poll]]s on November 2, 2004. {{fact}} Many voters responded that their primary concern in the election was "moral values."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It has been pointed out that this may be misleading because together more people mentioned the [[Iraq War]] and [[terrorism]] which were coded separately.{{fact}} Although "moral values" was the primary concern of a plurality of voters, the percentage who cited this as their primary concern was actually lower than in previous elections. [{{fact}}

==In Australia==

The concept of a "culture war" is also current in [[Australia]], particularly in the area of [[History of Australia|Australian historiography]]. The so-called [[history wars]] concern how to interpret the country's history, especially regarding Aborigines. [[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[John Howard]] is one participant as is evidenced in a recent speech. [http://www.pm.gov.au/news/speeches/speech1754.html]
