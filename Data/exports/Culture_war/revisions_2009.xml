The term frequently implies a conflict between those values considered traditional or [[Conservativism in the United States|conservative]] and those considered [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] or [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]].  The "culture war" is sometimes traced to the 1960s and has taken various forms since then. 

== Origins ==
The phrase "culture war" may have been influenced by the German ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' ("cultural struggle" or "struggle between cultures"; literally, "battle of cultures"), the campaign from 1871 to 1878 under [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] of the [[German Empire]] against the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

In any case, Italian [[Marxist]] [[Antonio Gramsci]] presented in the 1920s a theory of [[cultural hegemony]] to explain the slower advance, compared to many Marxists' expectations, of [[proletarian revolution]] in Europe. This stated that a culturally diverse society can be dominated by one class that has a monopoly over the mass media and popular culture, and Gramsci argued for a "culture war" in which [[anti-capitalist]] elements seek to gain a dominant voice in [[mass media]], education, and other mass institutions.

As an American phenomenon, its origin was in the 1920s when urban and rural American values came into clear conflict.  This followed several decades of immigration to the cities by elements considered alien by the earlier immigrants and was a result of the cultural shifts and modernizing trends of the [[Roaring 20s]], culminating in the presidential campaign of [[Al Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;

==1990s==
The expression was introduced again by the 1991 publication of ''Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America'' by James Davison Hunter, a [[sociologist]] at the [[University of Virginia]]. In it, Hunter described what he saw as a dramatic realignment and polarization that had transformed [[politics of the United States|American politics]] and [[American culture|culture]]. 

He argued that on an increasing number of "hot-button" defining issues &amp;mdash; [[abortion]], [[gun politics]], [[separation of church and state]], [[privacy]], [[recreational drug use]], [[homosexuality]], [[censorship]] issues &amp;mdash; there had come to be two definable polarities. Furthermore, it was not just that there were a number of divisive issues, but that society had divided along essentially the same lines on each of these issues, so as to constitute two warring groups, defined primarily not by nominal religion, ethnicity, social class, or even political affiliation, but rather by ideological [[world view]]s. 

Hunter characterised this polarity as stemming from opposite impulses, toward what he refers to as ''Progressivism'' and ''Orthodoxy''. The dichotomy has been adopted with varying labels, including, for example, by [[Fox News]] commentator [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] who emphasizes differences between "Secular-Progressives" and "Traditionalists".

In 1990 [[paleoconservatism|paleoconservative]] commentator [[Pat Buchanan]] mounted a campaign for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination for [[President of the United States]] against incumbent [[George H. W. Bush]] in [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]].  He received a prime time speech slot at the [[1992 Republican National Convention]], which is sometimes dubbed the "'''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'culture war' speech'''".&lt;ref&gt;
''"Not since Pat Buchanan's famous "culture war" speech in 1992 has a major speaker at a national political convention spoken so hatefully, at such length, about the opposition."''&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

During his speech, he said:  "There is a religious war going on in our country for the soul of America. It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we will one day be as was the Cold War itself." [http://www.buchanan.org/pa-92-0817-rnc.html]  In addition to criticizing "environmental extremists" and "radical feminism," he said [[public morality]] was a [[defining issue]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The agenda [Bill] Clinton and [Hillary] Clinton would impose on America &amp;mdash; abortion on demand, a litmus test for the Supreme Court, homosexual rights, discrimination against religious schools, women in combat &amp;mdash; that's change, all right. But it is not the kind of change America wants. It is not the kind of change America needs. And it is not the kind of change we can tolerate in a nation that we still call God's country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink = Patrick Buchanan| first=Patrick | last=Buchanan  | title=1992 Republican National Convention Speech | date=1992-08-17 | publisher= | url =http://www.buchanan.org/pa-92-0817-rnc.html |  accessdate = 2007-11-03 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A month later, Buchanan elaborated that this conflict was about power over society's definition of right and wrong.  He named abortion, sexual orientation and popular culture as major fronts – and mentioned other controversies,  including clashes over the [[Confederate Flag]], Christmas and taxpayer-funded art.  He also said that the negative attention his talk of a culture war received was itself evidence of America’s polarization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buchanan.org/pa-92-0914.html The Cultural War for the Soul of America - by Pat Buchanan - Articles, Essays and Speeches - T H E I N T E R N E T B R I G A D E - Official Web Site&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Buchanan ran for President in 1996, he promised to fight for the conservative side of the culture war:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I will use the [[bully pulpit]] of the Presidency of the United States, to the full extent of my power and ability, to defend American traditions and the values of faith, family, and country, from any and all directions. And, together, we will chase the purveyors of sex and violence back beneath the rocks whence they came.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4president.org/speeches/buchanan1996announcement.htm Announcement Speech by Patrick J&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==2000s==
In a 2004 column, [[Pat Buchanan]] said the culture war had reignited and that Americans no longer inhabited the same moral universe. He gave such examples as gay civil unions, the "crudity of the MTV crowd," and the controversy surrounding [[Mel Gibson|Mel Gibson's]] film, ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''. He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Who is in your face here? Who started this? Who is on the offensive? Who is pushing the envelope? The answer is obvious. A [[radical Left]] aided by a [[cultural elite]] that detests Christianity and finds Christian moral tenets reactionary and repressive is hell-bent on pushing its amoral values and imposing its ideology on our nation.
The unwisdom of what the Hollywood and the Left are about should be transparent to all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theamericancause.org/patculturewars.htm The Aggressors in the Culture Wars&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
