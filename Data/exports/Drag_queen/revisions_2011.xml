{{Crossdressing}}

A '''drag queen''' is a man who dresses, and usually acts, like a [[caricature]] [[woman]] often for the purpose of entertaining. There are many kinds of drag artists and they vary greatly, from professionals who have starred in films to people who just try it once. Drag queens also vary by class and culture and can vary even within the same city. Although many drag queens are [[gay]] men, there are drag artists of all genders and sexualities who do drag for various reasons or purposes. Women who dress like men for the same purpose are known as [[drag king]]s.

Generally, however drag queens are males who dress in a female [[gender role]], often exaggerating certain characteristics (such as make-up and eyelashes) for comic, dramatic or satirical effect. Other drag performers include [[drag king]]s, who are women who perform in male roles, [[faux queen]]s, who are women who dress in an exaggerated style to emulate drag queens and faux kings, who are men who dress to impersonate drag kings.

The term ''drag queen'' usually refers to people who dress in drag for the purpose of performing, whether singing or [[lip sync|lip-synching]], dancing, participating in events such as [[gay pride parade]]s, [[drag pageants]], or at venues such as [[cabaret]]s and [[discotheque]]s. In the [[United Kingdom]], alongside traditional drag work such as shows and performances, many drag queens engage in 'mix-and-mingle' or hosting work at night clubs or at private parties/events.
Drag is a part of Western [[Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures|gay culture]]; it is often noted that the [[Stonewall riots]] on June 27, 1969 in New York City were inspired and led by drag queens, and, in part for this reason, drag queens remain a tradition at gay pride events. Prominent drag queens in the gay community of a city often serve as official or unofficial spokespersons, hosts or emcees, fund-raisers, chroniclers and community leaders.

== Terminology ==
The etymology of the term "drag" is disputed. It was used in reference to transvestites at least as early as the 18th century, owing to the tendency of their skirts to drag on the ground.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The term ''drag queen'' occurred in [[Polari]], a subset of English slang that was popular in some gay communities in the early part of the 20th century.  A [[folk etymology]] whose [[acronym]] basis reveals the late 20th-century bias, would make "drag" an abbreviation of "dressed resembling a girl" in description of male [[transvestism]]. '''Queen''' may refer to the trait of affected royalty found in many drag characters. It is also related to the archaic word "quean" which was used as a label both for promiscuous women and gay men (see Oxford English Dictionary definition number 3 for "queen").

Another term for a drag queen ''female impersonator'', is still used—though it is often regarded as inaccurate, because many contemporary drag performers are not attempting to [[Passing (gender)|pass]] as women. ''Female impersonation'', has been and continues to be illegal in some places, which inspired the drag queen [[José Sarria]] to hand out labels to his friends reading "I am a boy," so he could not be accused of female impersonation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sarria_j.html glbtq &gt;&gt; social sciences &gt;&gt; Sarria, José&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; American drag queen [[RuPaul]] once said "I do not impersonate females! How many women do you know who wear seven-inch heels, four-foot wigs, and skintight dresses?"  He also said, "I don't dress like a woman; I dress like a drag queen!". Celebrity drag couple "The Darling Bears" go so far as to sport full beards for their performances.  Going in drag while retaining clearly masculine features is referred to as ''skag drag''.  Some performers draw the distinction that a female impersonator seeks to emulate a specific female star or celebrity, while a drag queen only seeks to create a distinctive feminine persona of his or her own.

There are also performers who prefer to be called "gender illusionists" who do blur the line between transgender and drag queen. Generally transgender performers do not consider themselves to be drag queens and drag queens don't consider themselves to be illusionists, but, as with everything, there are exceptions. Often these distinctions are more generational as laws and acceptance of individuality change and grow.

Many drag queens prefer to be referred to as "[[gender-specific pronoun|she]]" while in drag and desire to stay completely in character. Some performers object to being referred to as "he" or by their legal name while in character.  Drag performer RuPaul is an exception, as he seems to be completely ambivalent to which pronoun is used to refer to him.  In his words, "You can call me he.  You can call me she.  You can call me Regis and Kathie Lee; I don't care!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|author=[[Rupaul]]|title=Lettin' It All Hang Out: An Autobiography|publisher=Hyperion Books|date=1995-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drag and transvestism ==
[[File:2004-GayPrideBrazil-1.jpeg|thumb|left|180px|Drag queens walking in a parade in [[São Paulo, Brazil]].]]
Most drag queens perform for personal fulfillment as a [[hobby]], a [[profession]], or an [[art]] form; as a way to be in the spotlight; or as a road to local or wider fame. Historically and currently, there have been and are a significant number of [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] men, generally actors, who perform in drag. There are also transgender or [[Transsexuality|transsexual]] people, as well as straight women, who perform as drag queens.

Drag queens are sometimes called [[transvestism|transvestites]], although that term also has many other connotations than the term "drag queen". "Drag queen" usually connotes cross-dressing for the purposes of entertainment or performance without necessarily aiming to [[Passing (gender)|pass]] as female.  It is not generally used to describe those persons who cross-dress for the fulfillment of [[transvestic fetishism|transvestic fetishes]] alone, or whose [[cross-dressing]] is primarily part of a private sexual activity or identity. As for those whose motivation is not primarily sexual, and who may socialise cross-dressed, they tend not to adopt the typical over-the-top drag queen look.

== Drag queen names ==

&lt;!-- PLEASE NOTE: Please do not add drag queens names that don't already have an article on Wikipedia as this is not a list but simply some notable examples. If the article is deleted the name would also be removed from this article. --&gt;
There tend to be three types of drag names:
The first are satirical names that play on words, such as [[Miss Understood]], [[Peaches Christ]], [[Ciara Mist]], and [[John Epperson|Lypsinka]].

The second type are names that trend toward glamour and extravagance, such as [[Dame Edna Everage]], [[Chi Chi LaRue]], [[Margo Howard-Howard]], [[Funny Girls|Betty "Legs" Diamond]] and [[The Lady Chablis]]. This is the type used by the character Albin in the movie and musical ''[[La Cage aux Folles (film)|La Cage Aux Folles]]'' for his drag persona, "Miss ZaZa Napoli".

The third type is considered simpler but can have an in-depth backstory, cultural or geographical significance or simply be a feminine form of their "boy" name. Often a drag queen will pick a name or be given one by a friend or "drag mother" as a one-time occasion only to discover they like performing and go on to use a less-than ideal name for years. Drag queens do change names as well even using two or more concurrently for various reasons. Some examples of simpler names include [[Verka Serduchka]], [[Miss Coco Peru]], [[Shequida]], [[Rikki Reeves]], [[Chuck Knipp|Betty Butterfield]] and [[Divine (actor)|Divine]].

&lt;!-- PLEASE NOTE: Please do not add drag queens names that don't already have an article on Wikipedia as this is not a list but simply some notable examples. If the article is deleted the name would also be removed from this article. --&gt;

== Drag shows and venues ==

A '''drag show''' is an entertainment consisting of a variety of songs, [[monologue]]s or skits featuring either single performers or groups of performers in drag meant to entertain an audience. They range from amateur performances at small bars to elaborately staged theatrical presentations. Many drag shows feature performers singing or [[Lip sync|lip-synching]] to songs while performing a pre-planned [[pantomime]], or dancing. The performers often don elaborate costumes and makeup, and sometimes dress to imitate various famous female singers or personalities. And some events are centered around drag, such as [[Southern Decadence]] where the majority of festivities are led by the Grand Marshals, who are traditionally drag queens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southerndecadence.net Southern Decadence Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In music ==
[[File:Miss Understood by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Miss Understood]], who has appeared in several films and on television]]
Some male music celebrities wear exagerated feminine clothing as part of their show, but they should not be necessarily called drag queens. [[Boy George]] wears drag queen style clothes and cosmetics but he once stated he was not a drag queen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi6offnQQN0 BOY GEORGE: "I'M NOT A DRAGQUEEN!" at Youtube]&lt;/ref&gt; [[RuPaul]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dragqueendiaries.com/rupaul.htm Rupaul Biography] Drag Queen Diaries&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pete Burns]] are professional singers and drag queen performers.

Drag queens in lyrycal interpretation of some songs:
* [[Lola (song)|Lola]] by [[The Kinks]]
* [[Walk on the Wild Side (Lou Reed song)|Walk on the Wild Side]] by [[Lou Reed]]
* [[Dude (Looks Like a Lady)]] by [[Aerosmith]]
* [[Ballad of Cleo and Joe]] by [[Cyndi Lauper]]
* King for a Day by [[Green Day]]
* [[Cherry Lips]] by [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]]
* [[Born This Way (song)|Born This Way]] by [[Lady Gaga]]

== Genres ==
* High ''[[Camp (style)|camp]]'' drag queens employ a drag aesthetic based on [[clown]]-like values like exaggeration, [[satire]], and [[ribaldry]].  [[Pandora Boxx]], [[Glen Milstead|Divine]], [[Miss Understood]], [[Peaches Christ]], [[Hedda Lettuce]] and [[Jolene Sugarbaker]] can be considered examples of camp queens.

* Some drag queens exaggerate in the dimension of elegance and fashion, employing elaborate jewelry and gowns. [[The Lady Chablis]], who can be seen in the movie ''[[Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil]]'' is an example of this type of performer. Many of these drag queens impersonate specific actresses and pop divas such as [[Britney Spears]], [[Cher]], [[Bette Midler]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Gilla]], [[Charo]], [[Connie Francis]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Celine Dion|Céline Dion]], [[Diana Ross]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Patti LaBelle]], [[Shirley Bassey]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Spice Girls]], [[Lady Gaga]] and others, emulating their high-fashion costuming and jewelry.  Drag artist [[John Epperson]] has used the persona Lypsinka as a caricature of [[Joan Crawford]], including in his play ''The Passion of the Crawford''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.examiner.com/a-645293~Lypsinka_dearest_syncs_into_Joan.html Lypsinka dearest syncs into Joan],  Christina Troup, ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'', March 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cher-Drag-Impersonator.jpg|thumb|170px|right|A drag queen doing a celebrity impersonation of a gay icon, [[Cher]].]]
* Some drag queens primarily perform in [[Beauty contest|pageant]]s, hence the term ''pageant queen''.  Pageant queens gear their act toward winning titles and prizes in various contests and pageant systems. Some of these have grand prizes that rival those of pageants such as [[Miss America]]; see [[drag pageantry]]. These drag queens can be known nationally and many work professionally year-round producing and hosting shows that specialize in drag and celebrity illusionists.

* Post-modernist drag queens; an example would be The Divine David, now appearing as [[David Hoyle (performance artist)|David Hoyle]], who regularly performed in London during the 1990s in clubs such as Duckie, in South London. He used an extreme form of presentation, with make-up that was applied roughly and then smeared across his face. His act was designed to make the audience feel extremely uncomfortable about any preconceived ideas of acceptable subject matter for a drag queen to tackle. One show included cutting up a pig's head and throwing the pieces into the audience. As such, the act bore close similarities to [[performance art]] of the 1970s.  [[Vaginal Davis]], in Los Angeles, has performed as a drag queen for many years; her [[genderfuck]] performances, often mixing male and female signifiers (also called "sloppy drag"), and her many appearances in performance art venues since the 1980s attest to her status as a [[performance artist]].  Like [[RuPaul]], Davis is indifferent to whether addressed as "he" or "she."

== Societal reception ==
Drag has come to be a celebrated aspect of modern gay life. Many gay bars and clubs around the world hold drag shows as special parties. Several "[http://www.internationaldragday.com International Drag Day]" holidays have been started over the years to promote the shows. Typically, in the U.S. drag is celebrated in early March. This year, "Drag Day" falls on March 6.

However, within the larger [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) communities drag queens are sometimes criticized for their participation in pride parades and other public events, believing that this projects a limited and harmful image of gay people and impedes a broader social acceptance. In more recent years drag queens have been prominently featured at these same events. A common criticism of drag queens is that they promote harmful stereotypes of women, comparable to [[blackface]] portrayal of African-Americans by white performers that was popular in the early 20th century.

Drag queens are sometimes criticized by members of the transgender community—especially, but not exclusively, by many [[trans women]]—because of fears that they themselves may be stereotyped as drag queens. Canadian transgender activist [[Star Maris]] wrote a song entitled "I'm Not A Fucking Drag Queen" which expresses this viewpoint.  The song was featured in the film ''[[Better Than Chocolate]]'', performed by a male-to-female transsexual on stage at a gay club.  The transsexual character, played by [[Peter Outerbridge]], struggles throughout the movie to fit in with [[cisgender]] (non-transgender) women, and partially performs the song as an act of cathartic defiance and self-empowerment. Other transwomen reject those fears in the broader context that drag queens, many of whom are [[gender-variant]] and sexuality minorities, are more of an ally than a threat.
