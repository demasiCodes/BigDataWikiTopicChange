{{Cross-dressing}}
'''Drag queens''' are people, usually male, who dress in [[Drag (clothing)|women's clothing]] and often act with exaggerated [[femininity]] and in feminine [[gender role]]s with a primarily entertaining purpose. They often exaggerate make-up such as eyelashes for dramatic, comedic or satirical effect. Drag is closely associated with [[gay]] men and [[gay culture]], however a drag queen can be of any sexual orientation. Drag queens vary widely by class and culture and dedication, from professionals who star in films to people who try drag very occasionally.

The activity, which is called ''doing drag'', has many motivations, from individual self-expression to mainstream performance. Drag queen activities among stage and [[Street performance|street performers]] may include [[lip sync|lip-syncing]], live singing, dancing, participating in events such as [[gay pride parade]]s, [[drag pageants]], or at venues such as [[cabaret]]s and [[discotheque]]s.

Another term for a drag queen is ''female impersonator.''&lt;ref&gt;When Cross Dressing was a crime http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/books/2015/03/12/tbt-when-cross-dressing-was-crime?page=full&lt;/ref&gt; Although this is still used, it is sometimes regarded as inaccurate, because not all contemporary drag performers are attempting to [[Passing (gender)|pass]] as women. Female impersonation has been and continues to be illegal in some places, which inspired the drag queen [[José Sarria]] to hand out labels to his friends reading, "I am a boy", so he could not be accused of female impersonation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sarria_j.html |title=&gt;&gt; social sciences &gt;&gt; Sarria, José |publisher=glbtq |date=1923-12-12 |accessdate=2014-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203005833/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sarria_j.html |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; American drag queen [[RuPaul]] once said, "I do not impersonate females! How many women do you know who wear seven-inch heels, four-foot wigs, and skintight dresses?" He also said, "I don't dress like a woman; I dress like a drag queen!".&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Susan Corso (April 15, 2009).

===Alternative terms===
[[File:2004-GayPrideBrazil-1.jpeg|thumb|200px|alt=4 individuals portraying women|Drag queens walking in a parade in [[São Paulo, Brazil]].]]
Some drag queens  may prefer to be referred to as "[[gender-specific pronoun|she]]" while in drag and desire to stay completely in character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://transequality.org/issues/resources/understanding-drag |title=Understanding Drag |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-04-28 |website=transequality.org |publisher=National Center for Transgender Equality |access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other drag performers, like RuPaul, seem to be completely indifferent to which pronoun is used to refer to them. In his words, "You can call me he. You can call me she. You can call me Regis and Kathie Lee; I don't care! Just so long as you call me."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Rupaul]]|title=Lettin' It All Hang Out: An Autobiography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mq-HAAAAIAAJ|publisher=Hyperion Books|date=June 1995|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drag queens are sometimes called [[transvestism|transvestites]], although that term also has many other connotations than the term ''drag queen'' and is not much favored by many drag queens themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Zack.

Many drag performers refer to themselves as drag artists, as opposed to drag queens, as contemporary forms of drag have become [[nonbinary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Knauf |first1=Ana Sofia |title=Person of Interest: Arson Nicki |url=https://www.thestranger.com/features/2017/02/01/24834816/person-of-interest |website=The Stranger |publisher=Tim Keck |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lam |first1=Teresa |title=Getting to Know Non-Binary Drag Artist Rose Butch |url=https://hypebae.com/2018/6/rose-butch-non-binary-drag-performer-lgbtq-pride-month-vancouver-canada-interview |website=Hypebae |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of drag ==

=== Europe ===

==== Pantomime dames ====
In the late 1800s to the mid-1900s, [[pantomime dame]]s became a popular form of female impersonation in Europe.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This was the first era of female impersonation in Europe to use comedy as part of the performance, in contrast to the serious [[Shakespeare's plays|Shakespearean]] tragedies and [[Italian opera]]s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The dame became a stock character with a range of attitudes from "charwoman" to "grande dame" that was mostly used for improvisation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The most famous and successful pantomime dame was [[Dan Leno]].  After [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], the theatre and movie scenes were changing, and the use of pantomime dames declined.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== America ===
[[File:Wench character 3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eugene d'Ameli]], a white man, dressed in [[blackface]] as an African American woman for a [[minstrel show]] in the late 19th century]]

==== Minstrel shows ====
Development of the drag queen in the United States started with the development of the [[blackface]] [[minstrel show]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite |last=Boyd |first=Nan Alamilla |title=Wide-Open Town |publisher=University of California Press |year=2003 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/25351 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the performers would only mock African American men, but as time went on they found it amusing to mock African American femininity as well.  They performed in comedic skits, dances, and "wench" songs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite |last=Bean |first=Annemarie |title=Female Impersonation in Nineteenth-Century American Blackface Minstrelsy |publisher=[[New York University]] |date=2001 |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304709304/abstract/21B0435A209F4C54PQ/1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These minstrel shows and their "wench players" were used by white men to both mock and oppress women and African Americans.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==== Vaudeville and female impersonators ====
[[File:Julian Eltinge (the fascinating widow).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Julian Eltinge]] as a female impersonator in the 1910s]]
The broad comedic stylings of the minstrel shows helped develop the [[vaudeville]] shows of the late 1800s to the early 1900s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With this shift, the "wench players" became "prima donnas", and became more elegant and refined, while still retaining their comedic elements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  While the "wenches" were purely American creations, the "prima donnas" were inspired by both America and European cross-dressing shows, like [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] actors and [[castrato|castrati]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With the United States shifting demographics, including the shift from farms to cities, [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of African Americans, and an influx of [[immigration to the United States|immigrants]], vaudeville's broad comedy and music expanded the audience from minstrelsy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With vaudeville becoming more popular, it allowed female impersonators to become popular as well.  Many female impersonators started with low comedy in vaudeville and worked their way up to perform as the prima donna.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Moore, F. Michael. ''Drag!: Male and Female Impersonators on Stage, Screen, and Television: An Illustrated World History''. Jefferson, N.C: McFarland &amp; Company, 1994.
&lt;/ref&gt; Famous female impersonator [[Julian Eltinge]] found success in this and eventually made his way to the [[Broadway theatre|broadway]] stage performing as a woman.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  At this time being a female impersonator was seen as something for the straight white male, and any deviation was punished.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Connection with [[sex work]] and [[homosexuality]] eventually lead to the decline of vaudeville during the [[Progressive Era]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both the minstrelsy and vaudeville eras of female impersonation led to an association with music, dance, and comedy that still lasts today.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Night clubs ====
In the early to mid-1900s, female impersonation had become tied to the [[LGBT community]]{{Dubious|reason=This cannot be right as stated; there was no LGBT community in the mid 1900s, that didn't form till later|date=May 2017}} and thus criminality, so it had to change forms and locations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  It moved from being popular mainstream entertainment to something done only at night in disreputable areas, such as San Francisco's [[Tenderloin, San Francisco|Tenderloin]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Here female impersonation started to evolve into what we today know as [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] and drag queens.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Baker, Roger. ''Drag: A History of Female Impersonation in the Performing Arts''. NYU Press, 1994.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Drag queens such as [[José Sarria]]&lt;ref&gt;"The Drag Times." ''Drag'', 1980. Archives of Sexuality.
&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aleshia Brevard]]&lt;ref name="SMTimes-1961"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=February 3, 1961 |title=Finocchio's 1961 Revue One of LaMonte's Best |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/38985183/ |newspaper=The Times |location=San Mateo, California |page=23 |access-date=May 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; first came to prominence in these clubs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  People went to these [[Gay nightclub|nightclubs]] to play with the boundaries of gender and sexuality and it became a place for the LBGT community, especially gay men, to feel accepted.  As [[LGBT culture]] has slowly become more accepted in American society, drag has also become more, though not totally, acceptable in today's society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Protests ====
{{Main|Cooper Do-nuts Riot|Compton's Cafeteria riot|Stonewall riots|Invasion of the Pines}}
The [[Cooper Do-nuts Riot]] was a May 1959 incident in Los Angeles in which drag queens, lesbians, transgender women, and gay men rioted; it was one of the first [[LGBT]] uprisings in the United States.&lt;ref name="Out"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moffitt|first1=Evan|title=10 Years Before Stonewall, There Was the Cooper's Donuts Riot|url=https://www.out.com/today-gay-history/2015/5/31/today-gay-history-10-years-stonewall-there-was-coopers-donuts-riot|accessdate=30 June 2017|work=Out Magazine|agency=Here Media Inc.|date=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Compton's Cafeteria riot]], which involved drag queens and others, occurred in San Francisco in 1966.&lt;ref name="boyd"&gt;Boyd, Nan Alamilla (2004). "San Francisco" in the ''Encyclopedia of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered History in America'', Ed. Marc Stein. Vol. 3. Charles Scribner's Sons. pp. 71–78.&lt;/ref&gt; It marked the beginning of [[transgender]] activism in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="boyd"/&gt;

On March 17, 1968, in Los Angeles, to protest [[entrapment]] and harassment by the LAPD, two drag queens known as "The Princess" and "The Duchess" held a St. Patrick's Day party at [[Griffith Park]], a popular [[cruising for sex|cruising]] spot and a frequent target of police activity. More than 200 gay men socialized through the day.&lt;ref&gt;Witt, Lynn, Sherry Thomas and Eric Marcus (eds.) (1995). ''Out in All Directions: The Almanac of Gay and Lesbian America'', pg. 210. New York, Warner Books. {{ISBN|0-446-67237-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drag queens were also involved in the [[Stonewall riots]], a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the [[LGBT community]] against a [[police raid]] that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the [[Stonewall Inn]], located in the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], New York City. The riots are widely considered to be the catalyst for the [[gay liberation]] movement and the modern fight for [[LGBT rights in the United States]].&lt;ref name=diversity&gt;{{cite web |author=National Park Service |title=Workforce Diversity: The Stonewall Inn, National Historic Landmark National Register Number: 99000562 |url=http://www.nps.gov/diversity/stonewall.htm |publisher=US Department of Interior |year=2008 |accessdate=January 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/2012_Presidential_Election/Obama_inaugural_speech_references_Stonewall_riots.html |title=Obama inaugural speech references Stonewall gay-rights riots |publisher=North Jersey Media Group Inc |date=January 21, 2013 |accessdate=January 21, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723025158/http://www.northjersey.com/news/2012_Presidential_Election/Obama_inaugural_speech_references_Stonewall_riots.html |archivedate=July 23, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 1976, a restaurant in [[Fire Island Pines, New York|Fire Island Pines]], [[New York (state)|New York]], denied entry to a visitor in drag named Terry Warren. When Warren's friends in Cherry Grove heard what had happened, they dressed up in drag, and, on [[United States Bicentennial|July 4, 1976]], sailed to the Pines by [[water taxi]]. This turned into a yearly event where drag queens go to the Pines, called the [[Invasion of the Pines]].

==== Story time in libraries ====
In December 2015, Radar Productions and [[Michelle Tea]] developed the concept of "Drag Queen Story Hour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lamarche |first1=Una |title=Drag Queen Story Hour Puts the Rainbow in Reading |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/style/drag-queen-story-hour-puts-the-rainbow-in-reading.html |accessdate=22 June 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=19 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Launched at the [[San Francisco Public Library]], Drag Queen Story Hour was adopted by the [[Brooklyn Public Library]] in the summer of 2016, and has since traveled to various libraries, museums, bookstores, and recreation centers, and parks across the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Drag Queen Story Hour|url=https://www.dragqueenstoryhour.org/#about|website=Drag Queen Story Hour -- drag queens reading stories to children in libraries, schools, and bookstores|publisher=Drag Queen Story Hour|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art of drag ==
[[File:ESC2014 - Austria 16.jpg|thumb|alt=man with long hair and a beard, wearing a radiant gold dress|[[Conchita Wurst]], the winner of the Eurovision Song Contest 2014.]]
The process of getting into drag or into character can take hours. A drag queen may aim for a certain style, celebrity impression, or message with their look. Hair, make-up, and costumes are the most important essentials for drag queens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2002/10/03/dude-diva-how-become-drag-queen |title=Dude to Diva: How to Become a Drag Queen &amp;#124; The Chronicle |publisher=Dukechronicle.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Drag queens tend to go for a more exaggerated look with a lot more makeup than a typical feminine woman would wear.

Some people do drag simply as a means of self-expression,&lt;ref name="PsyToday"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2015/05/drag_queens_find_form_of_self-.html |title=Performing in drag is all about self-expression for some West Michigan men |last=Jackson |first=Angie |date=May 20, 2015 |access-date=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but often drag queens (once they have completed a look) will go out to clubs and bars and perform a "drag show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark|last=King |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/aug/12/drag-queen-cookie-monstar |title=A working life: the drag queen &amp;#124; Money |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many drag queens do dress up for money by doing different shows, but there are also drag queens that have full-time jobs but still enjoy dressing up in drag as a hobby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-bartolomei/10-myths-about-drag-queens_b_2979249.html |title=Tom Bartolomei: 10 Myths About Drag Queens |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2013-04-01 |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many parts of the drag show, and of the drag queens' other intellectual properties, cannot be protected by intellectual property law. To substitute the lack of legal protection, drag queens revert to social norms in order to protect their intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sarid|first1=Eden|title=Don’t Be a Drag, Just Be a Queen – How Drag Queens Protect their Intellectual Property without Law|journal=Florida International University Law Review|date=2014|volume=10|issue=1|url=http://ecollections.law.fiu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1242&amp;context=lawreview|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drag shows and venues ===
[[File:Lorellasukkiarini.jpg|thumb|alt=a drag queen putting on lip liner|A drag queen preparing stage make-up.]]
A ''[[drag show]]'' is an entertainment consisting of a variety of songs, [[monologue]]s or skits featuring either single performers or groups of performers in drag meant to entertain an audience. They range from amateur performances at small bars to elaborately staged theatrical presentations. Many drag shows feature performers singing or [[Lip sync|lip-synching]] to songs while performing a pre-planned [[pantomime]], or dancing. The performers often don elaborate costumes and makeup, and sometimes dress to imitate various famous female singers or personalities. Some events are centered around drag, such as [[Southern Decadence]] where the majority of festivities are led by the Grand Marshals, who are traditionally drag queens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southerndecadence.net |title=Southern Decadence Official Website |publisher=Southerndecadence.net |date=2013-09-03 |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In music ===

While some male music celebrities wear exaggerated feminine clothing as part of their show, they are not necessarily drag queens. For example, [[Boy George]] wears drag queen style clothes and cosmetics but he once stated he was not a drag queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi6offnQQN0 |title=Boy George: "I'M Not A Dragqueen!" At YouTube |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2007-12-27 |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[RuPaul]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dragqueendiaries.com/rupaul.htm Rupaul Biography] Drag Queen Diaries&lt;/ref&gt; is a professional drag queen performer and singer.

=== In television === 
''[[What Would You Do? (ABC News series)|What Would You Do?]]'', airing since early 2008, has had episodes featuring drag queens.&lt;ref&gt;https://abcnews.go.com/WhatWouldYouDo/video/parents-disapprove-drag-queen-sons-eat-56275264&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://abcnews.go.com/WhatWouldYouDo/drag-queens-harassed-cafe/story?id=12332984&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2008, RuPaul began producing ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]'', a [[reality television]] [[game show]] which began airing in February 2009. The premise of the program has several drag queens compete to be selected by RuPaul and a panel of judges as "America's next drag superstar". It inspired the similar spin-off shows ''[[RuPaul's Drag U]]'' and ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars]]''.

In 2018, ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 21 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' featured Queen Shane Jenek (drag name [[Courtney Act]]) as one of its contestants, placing first in the season with 49.43% of the public vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/celebrity-big-brother/news/a849084/courtney-act-winner-celebrity-big-brother-2018/|title=Courtney Act crowned winner of Celebrity Big Brother|date=2018-02-02|work=Digital Spy|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, ''[[American Idol (season 16)|American Idol]]'' featured a drag queen, Adam Sanders (drag name Ada Vox) as one of its contestants.&lt;ref name="goodhousekeeping1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/entertainment/a20054917/ada-vox-american-idol-facts/ |title=Facts About Ada Vox From "American Idol" You Need to Know |publisher=Goodhousekeeping.com |date=2018-04-25 |accessdate=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made it to the top ten.&lt;ref name="goodhousekeeping1"/&gt;

== In education ==
While drag queens have a prevalent status as entertainers, they play a role in educating people on gender roles and stereotyping. Professor Stephen Schacht of Plattsburgh State University of New York began introducing his and his students experiences of attending a Drag Show to his gender/sexualities class to challenge his students ideas of dichotomy. Over time he began inviting students to attend with him. He gathered from his students that after attending the drag show they had a new appreciation for gender and sexuality and often become very vocal about their new experiences in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J082v46n03_14 |title=Browse journals by subject |publisher=Tandfonline.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Societal reception ==
Drag has come to be a celebrated aspect of modern gay life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sarid|first1=Eden|title=Don ’t Be a Drag, Just Be a Queen—How Drag Queens Protect their Intellectual Property without Law|journal=Florida International University Law Review|date=2014|volume=10|issue=1|page=142|url=http://ecollections.law.fiu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1242&amp;context=lawreview}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many gay bars and clubs around the world hold drag shows as special parties. Several "International Drag Day" holidays have been started over the years to promote the shows. In the U.S. Drag Day is typically celebrated in early March.

A televised drag competition, ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]'', is the most successful program on the [[Logo (TV channel)|Logo]] television network. In 2016, the show won a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/rupauls-drag-race|title=RuPaul's Drag Race|website=Television Academy|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the show became the first show to win a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program]] and a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Billboard |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/8475768/rupauls-drag-race-emmys-win-reaction-tweets |title='RuPaul's Drag Race's Emmys Win: See The Best Reactions |publisher=Billboard |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-host-for-a-reality-or-reality-competition-program |title=Nominees/Winners &amp;#124; Television Academy |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-reality-competition-program |title=Nominees/Winners &amp;#124; Television Academy |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its winners and contestants have yet to receive the same level of recognition as mainstream reality show contestants.

RuPaul received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for his contributions to the television industry on March 16, 2018, making him the first drag queen to be given such an award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/23/entertainment/hollywood-walk-fame-2018/index.html |title=Hollywood Walk of Fame Class of 2018 revealed |last=France |first=Lisa Respers |date=23 June 2017 |website=CNN |access-date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/rupaul-hollywood-walk-of-fame|title=RuPaul Is the First Drag Queen to Get a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
