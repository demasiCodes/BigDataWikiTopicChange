{{Crossdressing}}

A '''drag queen''' is a man who dresses, and often acts, like a [[caricature]] [[woman]] often for the purpose of entertaining. There are many kinds of drag artists and they vary greatly, from professionals who have starred in films to people who just try it once. Drag queens also vary by class and culture and can vary even within the same cities. There are drag artists of all genders and sexualities who do drag for various reasons or purposes.

Generally drag queens are males who dress and act in a female [[gender role]], often exaggerating certain characteristics (such as make-up and eyelashes) for comic, dramatic or satirical effect. Other drag performers include [[drag king]]s, who are women who perform in male roles, [[faux queen]]s, who are women who dress in an exaggerated style to emulate drag queens, and faux kings, who are men who dress to impersonate drag kings.

The term ''drag queen'' usually refers to people who dress in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] for the purpose of performing, whether singing or [[lip sync|lip-synching]], dancing, participating in events such as [[gay pride parade]]s, [[drag pageants]], or at venues such as [[cabaret]]s and [[discotheque]]s. In the [[United Kingdom]], alongside traditional drag work such as shows and performances, many drag queens engage in "mix-and-mingle" or hosting work at night clubs or at private parties and events. Drag is a part of Western [[Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures|gay culture]].

== Terminology ==

===Drag queen===

The [[etymology]] of the term "drag queen" is disputed. The term ''drag queen'' occurred in [[Polari]], a subset of English slang that was popular in some gay communities in the early part of the 20th century. Its first recorded use to refer to actors dressed in women's clothing is from 1870.&lt;ref name="autogenerated231"&gt;{{cite book|title=Languages and cultures in contrast and comparison|year=2008|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=9789027254191|page=231|author=Felix Rodriguez Gonzales|chapter=The feminine stereotype in gay characterization: A look at English and Spanish|editor=María de los Ángeles Gómez-González, María A. Gómez-González, J. Lachlan Mackenzie, Elsa González Álvarez}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[folk etymology]] whose [[acronym]] basis reveals the late 20th-century bias, would make "drag" an abbreviation of "Dressed as A Girl" in description of male theatrical [[transvestism]]. However, there is no trace of this supposed stage direction in Dessen and Thomson's ''Dictionary of Stage Directions in English Drama, 1580-1642''. '''Queen''' may refer to the trait of affected royalty found in many drag characters. It is also related to the Old English word "quean" or ''cwene'', which originally simply meant "woman", then was later used as a label both for promiscuous women and gay men (see Oxford English Dictionary definition number 3 for "queen"). '''Drag''' as a term referring to women's clothing worn by men has less clear origins. According to one theory, it was used in reference to transvestites at least as early as the 18th century, owing to the tendency of their skirts to drag on the ground.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Another possibility is that it derives from non-English languages. ''Bardah'' was a Persian word meaning "slave", which developed into the Spanish term ''bardaje'' referring to a [[catamite]]. This was borrowed into French as ''bardache''. The French word was then used in America in the American-English form ''berdache'', and was used in referring to indigenous men who assumed the role of homemaker and dressed as a woman, while the wife left the home to assume warrior duties.&lt;ref name="autogenerated231"/&gt;

===Female impersonator===
Another term for a drag queen ''female impersonator'', is still used—though it is sometimes regarded as inaccurate, because some contemporary drag performers are not attempting to [[Passing (gender)|pass]] as women. ''Female impersonation'', has been and continues to be illegal in some places, which inspired the drag queen [[José Sarria]] to hand out labels to his friends reading, "I am a boy," so he could not be accused of female impersonation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sarria_j.html glbtq &gt;&gt; social sciences &gt;&gt; Sarria, José&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; American drag queen [[RuPaul]] once said, "I do not impersonate females! How many women do you know who wear seven-inch heels, four-foot wigs, and skintight dresses?" He also said, "I don't dress like a woman; I dress like a drag queen!". Celebrity drag couple "The Darling Bears" go so far as to sport full beards for their performances, which could also be referred to as [[genderfuck]]. Going in drag while retaining clearly masculine features is referred to as ''skag drag''. Some performers draw the distinction that a female impersonator seeks to emulate a specific female star or celebrity, while a drag queen only seeks to create a distinctive feminine persona of his or her own.

===Alternative terms===
There are also performers who prefer to be called "gender illusionists" who do blur the line between transgender and drag queen. Generally transgender performers do not consider themselves to be drag queens and drag queens don't consider themselves to be illusionists, but, as with everything, there are exceptions. Often these distinctions are more generational as laws and acceptance of individuality, change and growth.

Many drag queens prefer to be referred to as "[[gender-specific pronoun|she]]" while in drag and desire to stay completely in character. Some performers object to being referred to as "he" or by their legal name while in character. Drag performer RuPaul is an exception, as he seems to be completely indifferent to which pronoun is used to refer to him. In his words, "You can call me he. You can call me she. You can call me Regis and Kathie Lee; I don't care!"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Rupaul]]|title=Lettin' It All Hang Out: An Autobiography|publisher=Hyperion Books|date=1995-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term tranny has been embraced by drag performers, notably RuRaul,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Spargo |url=http://www.newnownext.com/rupaul-tranny-lance-bass-drag-race/01/2012/ |title=NEW: RuPaul's 'Tranny' Conroversy |publisher=NewNowNext |date=2012-01-15 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the gay male community&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Musto |first=Michael |url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/dailymusto/2010/11/is_tranny_so_ba.php |title=Is "Tranny" So Bad? |publisher=Blogs.villagevoice.com |date=2010-11-12 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States. It is considered offensive to transgender and transsexual people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bilerico.com/2008/09/is_tranny_offensive.php |title=Is 'Tranny' Offensive? |publisher=The Bilerico Project |date=2008-09-09 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Monica Roberts |url=http://transgriot.blogspot.com/2009/02/gay-media-rupaul-isnt-transgender.html |title=TransGriot: Gay Media, RuPaul Isn't A Transgender 'Expert', So Stop Trying To Pass Him Off As One |publisher=Transgriot.blogspot.com |date=2009-02-22 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this usage is offensive in the transgender community where it is taken as a degrading term along the lines of the highly offensive word "fag" in gay communities. This has caused the usage of the term to diminish.

== Drag and transvestism ==
[[File:2004-GayPrideBrazil-1.jpeg|thumb|left|180px|Drag queens walking in a parade in [[São Paulo, Brazil]].]]
Most drag queens perform for personal fulfillment as a [[hobby]], a [[profession]], or an [[art]] form; as a way to be in the spotlight; or as a road to local or wider fame. Historically and currently, there have been and are a significant number of [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] men, generally actors, who perform in drag. There are also transgender or [[Transsexuality|transsexual]] people, as well as straight women,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} who perform as drag queens.

Drag queens are sometimes called [[transvestism|transvestites]], although that term also has many other connotations than the term "drag queen". "Drag queen" usually connotes cross-dressing for the purposes of entertainment or performance without necessarily aiming to [[Passing (gender)|pass]] as female. It is not generally used to describe those persons who cross-dress for the fulfillment of [[transvestic fetishism|transvestic fetishes]] alone, or whose [[cross-dressing]] is primarily part of a private sexual activity or identity. As for those whose motivation is not primarily sexual, and who may socialise cross-dressed, they tend not to adopt the typical over-the-top drag queen look.

== Drag queen names ==

&lt;!-- PLEASE NOTE: Please do not add drag queens names that don't already have an article on Wikipedia as this is not a list but simply some notable examples. If the article is deleted the name would also be removed from this article. --&gt;
There are various types of drag names. Many fall into two categories:
The first are satirical names that play on words, such as [[Miss Understood]] and [[John Epperson|Lypsinka]].

The second type are names that trend toward glamour and extravagance, such as [[Dame Edna Everage]], [[Chi Chi LaRue]], and [[The Lady Chablis]]. This is the type used by the character Albin in the movie and musical ''[[La Cage aux Folles (film)|La Cage Aux Folles]]'' for his drag persona, "Miss ZaZa Napoli".

Other types can have an in-depth backstory, cultural or geographical significance or simply be a feminine form of their "boy" name. Some examples of these varieties include [[Verka Serduchka]], [[Miss Coco Peru]], [[Shequida]], [[Chuck Knipp|Betty Butterfield]] and [[Divine (actor)|Divine]].

Often a drag queen will pick a name or be given one by a friend or "drag mother" as a one-time occasion only to discover they like performing and go on to use a less-than ideal name for years. Drag queens do change names as well even using two or more concurrently for various reasons.

== Art of Drag ==

The process of getting into drag or into character can take hours.  As a reminder, drag queens are men, who dress up as women for entertainment, which means body hair, must be hidden or waxed.  The goal is to look feminine, as a female impersonator a drag queen must look their part.  Of course hair, make-up and costumes are the most important essentials for drag queens. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2002/10/03/dude-diva-how-become-drag-queen&lt;/ref&gt;
Drag is a form of art; there is so much work and creativity that is put into transforming into a drag queen.  The steps are limitless, Makeup is the first essential in transforming, every drag queen must have flawless skin, that is where foundation comes in to play, a clean clear face need to be able to cover all wrinkles, flaws, blemishes which help create a clean canvas.  Once the clean canvas is created, eye shadow will be added to eyes for an intense, dramatic look. Drag queen uses a lot of eyelashes to give the eyes a more intense look. It’s all about layering different colors of eye shadows, bronzers and blush into creating a finish face on a drag queen. Since drag queen are men, contouring is very important in creating high cheekbones, a more slimming face as well as creating a more smaller structured nose.  After the makeup process the drag queen will be adding hair to the look will give the look a more realistic women-like head. Many drag queens often wear wigs or hairpieces.  To finish up the look, a perfect costume is needed, depending on the event and the look that each drag queen are going for the costumes can consist of a sparkling sequin dress, a leopard body suit, and even a fur coat. ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOIrIHW1k2w&lt;/ref&gt; Drag queen tends to like the more exaggerated look with a lot more makeup, bigger than a typical female.  With the complete look, drag queens often go out to clubs and bars to where they will typically perform an act which is called a “drag show”. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/aug/12/drag-queen-cookie-monstar&lt;/ref&gt;  Many drag queens do dress up for money such as doing different shows but there are drag queens that have full-time jobs but still enjoy dressing up in drag as a hobby.  &lt;ref&gt; http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-bartolomei/10-myths-about-drag-queens_b_2979249.html&lt;/ref&gt;


== Drag shows and venues ==
[[File:Lorellasukkiarini.jpg|thumb|Lorella Sukkiarini, an Italian drag queen, preparing stage make-up.]]
A '''drag show''' is an entertainment consisting of a variety of songs, [[monologue]]s or skits featuring either single performers or groups of performers in drag meant to entertain an audience. They range from amateur performances at small bars to elaborately staged theatrical presentations. Many drag shows feature performers singing or [[Lip sync|lip-synching]] to songs while performing a pre-planned [[pantomime]], or dancing. The performers often don elaborate costumes and makeup, and sometimes dress to imitate various famous female singers or personalities. And some events are centered around drag, such as [[Southern Decadence]] where the majority of festivities are led by the Grand Marshals, who are traditionally drag queens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southerndecadence.net Southern Decadence Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;In most cases, you can see drag performance at bars without any cost, but there are other drag queen performances where you would have to purchase tickets in advance to see them perform.

== In music ==
[[File:Miss Understood by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Miss Understood]], who has appeared in several films and on television]]
Some male music celebrities wear exaggerated feminine clothing as part of their show, but they should not be necessarily called drag queens. [[Boy George]] wears drag queen style clothes and cosmetics but he once stated he was not a drag queen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi6offnQQN0 BOY GEORGE: "I'M NOT A DRAGQUEEN!" at Youtube]&lt;/ref&gt; [[RuPaul]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dragqueendiaries.com/rupaul.htm Rupaul Biography] Drag Queen Diaries&lt;/ref&gt; is a professional drag queen performer.

== Genres ==
* High ''[[Camp (style)|camp]]'' drag queens employ a drag aesthetic based on [[clown]]-like values like exaggeration, [[satire]], and [[ribaldry]]. [[Glen Milstead|Divine]], [[Miss Understood]], [[Peaches Christ]] and [[Hedda Lettuce]] can be considered examples of camp queens.

* Some drag queens exaggerate in the dimension of elegance and fashion, employing elaborate jewelry and gowns. [[The Lady Chablis]], who can be seen in the movie ''[[Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil]]'' is an example of this type of performer. Many of these drag queens impersonate specific actresses and pop divas such as [[Cher]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Bette Midler]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Gilla]], [[Charo]], [[Connie Francis]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Celine Dion|Céline Dion]], [[Diana Ross]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Patti LaBelle]], [[Shirley Bassey]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Spice Girls]], [[Lady Gaga]] and others, emulating their high-fashion costuming and jewelry. Drag artist [[John Epperson]] has used the persona Lypsinka as a caricature of [[Joan Crawford]], including in his play ''The Passion of the Crawford''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.examiner.com/a-645293~Lypsinka_dearest_syncs_into_Joan.html Lypsinka dearest syncs into Joan], Christina Troup, ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'', March 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cher-Drag-Impersonator.jpg|thumb|170px|right|A drag queen doing a celebrity impersonation of a gay icon, [[Cher]].]]

* Some drag queens primarily perform in [[Beauty contest|pageant]]s, hence the term ''pageant queen''. Pageant queens gear their act toward winning titles and prizes in various contests and pageant systems. Some of these have grand prizes that rival those of pageants such as [[Miss America]]; see [[drag pageantry]]. These drag queens can be known nationally and many work professionally year-round producing and hosting shows that specialize in drag and celebrity illusionists.

* Post-modernist drag queens, [[tranimal]], or "terrorist drag" mixes performance art, punk rock, racial and social issues into drag. The drag queens often purposely use unkempt wigs and clothing. [[Vaginal Davis]] and [[Christeene Vale]] are examples of "drag terrorists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weathers|first=Christeene|title=Christeene by Chelsea Weathers|url=http://www.artlies.org/article.php?id=1950&amp;issue=67&amp;s|work=Art Lies|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis' performances have been described as a reaction against the "conservative politics of gay culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Dominic|title=Vaginal Davis' Biography|url=http://www.vaginaldavis.com/bio.shtml|work=[[Vaginal Davis|VaginalDavis.com]]|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[David Hoyle (performance artist)|David Hoyle]] describes himself as an "anti-drag queen" in his use self-harm to parody what he views as materialism and hedonism within the gay community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Walters|first=Ben|title=Welcome back David Hoyle: you're a divine director|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2010/mar/24/david-hoyle-london-gay-lesbian-film|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=9 March 2013|date=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tranimal]] drag also breaks conventional ways of dressing like a woman by taking influences from [[Leigh Bowery]] and [[the Cockettes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shellhammer|first=Bradford|title=jer ber jones (Bradford Shellhammer : Interviews)|url=http://www.bradfordshellhammer.com/interviews/2010/12/jer_ber_jones.html|work=BradfordShellhammer.com|accessdate=23 March 2013|date=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Romano|first=Tricia|title=How to Become a Tranimal|url=http://www.blackbookmag.com/nightlife/la-nightlife-denizens-get-a-tranimal-makeover-1.33349|work=[[BlackBook]]|accessdate=23 March 2013|date=1 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Starting in the late 20th Century, groups of drag queens have come together under a unifying identity and shtick to perform a charitable and/or activist function in their communities. Some perform to raise funds for other charities, LGBT and other, while others protest for LGBT and Civil rights. These groups include The West Hollywood Cheerleaders, the [[Imperial Court System]] founded by The Widow Norton ([[José Julio Sarria]]), and The [[Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence]]. Some of these groups, such as the Sisters, perform a quasi-spiritual function or act as social counselors, consciously reviving the ancient archetype of historical drag queens as shamans and spiritual functionaries. The common practice and aesthetic here is flamboyance in service.

== Societal reception ==
Drag has come to be a celebrated aspect of modern gay life. Many gay bars and clubs around the world hold drag shows as special parties. Several "[http://www.internationaldragday.com International Drag Day]" holidays have been started over the years to promote the shows. Typically, in the U.S. drag is celebrated in early March. This year, "Drag Day" falls on March 6.

On the [[Logo (TV channel)|Logo]] television network, its most successful program is a drag competition, ''RuPaul's Drag Race''. However, its winners and contestants have yet to receive the same praise as mainstream reality show contestants.

However, within the larger [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) communities drag queens are sometimes criticized for their participation in pride parades and other public events, believing that this projects a limited and harmful image of gay people and impedes a broader social acceptance. In more recent years drag queens have been prominently featured at these same events. A common criticism of drag queens is that they promote harmful stereotypes of women, comparable to [[blackface]] portrayal of African-Americans by white performers that was popular in the early 20th century.

Drag queens are sometimes criticized by members of the transgender community — especially, but not exclusively, by many [[trans women]] — because of fears that they themselves may be stereotyped as drag queens. Canadian transgender activist [[Star Maris]] wrote a song entitled "I'm Not A Fucking Drag Queen" which expresses this viewpoint. The song was featured in the film ''[[Better Than Chocolate]]'', performed by a male-to-female transsexual on stage at a gay club. The transsexual character, played by [[Peter Outerbridge]], struggles throughout the movie to fit in with [[cisgender]] (non-transgender) women, and partially performs the song as an act of cathartic defiance and self-empowerment. Other transwomen reject those fears in the broader context that drag queens, many of whom are [[gender-variant]] and sexuality minorities, are more of an ally than a threat.
