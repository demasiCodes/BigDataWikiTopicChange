A '''drag queen''' is a person, usually male,&lt;!-- NOTE: "Usually male" is used because drag queens are most commonly men; they most commonly identify as male. The "usually" text is the result of extensive talk page discussion and reaching a compromise. If wanting to change this to be broader in its gender application, please discuss on the talk page first. But the viewpoint that drag queens may be of any gender is noted in this paragraph. --&gt;  who uses [[Drag (clothing)|drag clothing]] and makeup to imitate and often exaggerate [[femininity|female gender signifiers]] and [[gender roles]] for entertainment purposes. In modern times, drag queens are associated with [[gay men]] and [[gay culture]], but people of other [[gender identity|genders]] and [[sexual identity|sexual identities]] also perform as drag queens.

People partake in the activity of ''doing drag'' for reasons ranging from self-expression to mainstream performance. Drag shows frequently include [[lip sync|lip-syncing]], live singing, and dancing. They occur at events like [[gay pride parade]]s, [[carnival]]s and [[drag pageants]] and in venues such as [[cabaret]]s and [[discotheque|nightclub]]s. Drag queens vary by type, culture, and dedication, from professionals who star in films to people who do drag only occasionally.

===''Female impersonator''===
The term ''female impersonator'' was commonly used in the past. In 1972, Esther Newton described a ''female impersonator'' as a "professional drag queen".&lt;ref name="newton_3"/&gt; She considered the term ''female impersonator'' to be the one that was (then) widely understood by heterosexual audiences.&lt;ref name="newton_3"/&gt;

Female impersonation can be traced back at least as far as ancient Greece.  There was little to no gender equity then and women held a lower social status. This meant male actors would play female roles during theatrical performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Gewertz|first=Ken|date=17 July 2003|title=When men were men (and women, too)|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2003/07/when-men-were-men-and-women-too/|access-date=10 February 2022|website=The Harvard Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This tradition continued for centuries but began to be less prevalent as motion pictures became popular.  During the era of [[vaudeville]] it was considered immodest for women to appear on stage.  Due to that circumstance, some men became famous as "female impersonators", the most notable being [[Julian Eltinge]].  At the peak of his career he was one of the most sought after and highest paid actors in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Goodman|first=Elyssa|date=6 April 2018|title=Drag Herstory: This Drag Queen Was Once the Highest Paid Actor in the World|url=https://www.them.us/story/julian-eltinge-drag-queen-history|access-date=10 February 2022|website=them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female impersonation has been and continues to be illegal in some places, which inspired the drag queen [[José Sarria]] to hand out labels to his friends reading, "I am a boy", so they could not be accused of female impersonation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sarria_j.html |title=&gt;&gt; social sciences &gt;&gt; Sarria, José |publisher=glbtq |date=12 December 1923 |access-date=1 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203005833/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sarria_j.html |archive-date=3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American drag queen [[RuPaul]] once said, "I do not impersonate females! How many women do you know who wear seven-inch heels, four-foot wigs, and skintight dresses?" He also said, "I don't dress like a woman; I dress like a drag queen!"&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Susan Corso (15 April 2009).

===Uncommon terms===
In the drag queen world today, there is an ongoing debate about whether transgender drag queens are actually considered "Drag Queens". Some argue that, because a drag queen is defined as a man portraying a woman, transgender women cannot be drag queens. [[Drag king]]s are women who assume a masculine aesthetic. However this is not always the case, because there are also biokings, bio-queens, and [[Female queen (drag)|female queens]], which are people who perform their own biological sex through a heightened or exaggerated gender presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.4324/9780203057094|title=The Drag Queen Anthology|year=2013|last1=Underwood|first1=Lisa|isbn=9780203057094}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://academic.eb.com/?target=%2Flevels%2Fcollegiate%2Farticle%2Fdrag-queen%2F627517|title=Britannica Academic|website=academic.eb.com|access-date=5 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Joshua Trey|last2=Johnson|first2=Corey W.|date=November 2013|title=We Are All Royalty|journal=Journal of Leisure Research|volume=45|issue=5|pages=677–694|doi=10.18666/jlr-2013-v45-i5-4369|s2cid=143305970|issn=0022-2216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 the Canadian film ''[[Outrageous!]]'', starring drag queen [[Craig Russell (Canadian actor)|Craig Russell]], became one of the first gay-themed films to break out into mainstream theatrical release.
 	
In 1980, for the first time, a police presence protected gay spectators and drag queens from anti-gay harassment at the annual Hallowe'en show at Toronto's St. Charles Tavern.

=== Europe ===

==== Pantomime dames ====
In the late 1800s to the mid-1900s, [[pantomime dame]]s became a popular form of female impersonation in Europe.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This was the first era of female impersonation in Europe to use comedy as part of the performance, contrasting with the serious [[Shakespearean tragedy|Shakespearean tragedies]] and [[Italian opera]]s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The dame became a [[stock character]] with a range of attitudes from "[[charwoman]]" to "[[grande dame]]" that mainly was used for improvisation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The most famous and successful pantomime dame was [[Dan Leno]]. After World War I and World War II, the theatre and movie scenes were changing, and the use of pantomime dames declined.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== United States ===
==== First drag balls ====
The first person known to describe himself as "the queen of drag" was [[William Dorsey Swann]], born enslaved in Hancock, Maryland, who in the 1880s started hosting [[Ball culture|drag balls]] in [[Washington, DC]] attended by other men who were formerly enslaved, and often raided by the police, as documented in the newspapers.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Joseph|first=Channing Gerard|date=31 January 2020|title=The First Drag Queen Was a Former Slave|journal=The Nation|language=en-US|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/society/drag-queen-slave-ball/|access-date=4 February 2020|issn=0027-8378}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, Swann was convicted and sentenced to 10 months in jail on the false charge of "keeping a disorderly house" (euphemism for running a brothel) and requested a pardon from the [[Grover Cleveland|president]] for holding a drag ball (the request was denied).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;[[File:Wench character 3.jpg|thumb|upright|Eugene d'Ameli, a white man, dressed in [[blackface]] as an African-American woman for a [[minstrel show]] in the late 19th century]]

==== Minstrel shows ====
Development of the drag queen in the United States was influenced by the development of the [[blackface]] [[minstrel show]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{citation |last=Boyd |first=Nan Alamilla |title=Wide-Open Town |publisher=University of California Press |year=2003 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/25351 |isbn=9780520938748 |access-date=1 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827045758/https://muse.jhu.edu/book/25351 |archive-date=27 August 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the performers would only mock African American men, but as time went on they found it amusing to mock African American femininity as well.  They performed in comedic skits, dances, and "wench" songs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{citation |last=Bean |first=Annemarie |title=Female Impersonation in Nineteenth-Century American Blackface Minstrelsy |publisher=[[New York University]] |date=2001 |id={{ProQuest|304709304}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Vaudeville and female impersonators ====
[[File:Julian Eltinge (the fascinating widow).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Julian Eltinge]] as a female impersonator in the Fascinating Widow, early 1910s]]
The broad comedic stylings of the minstrel shows helped develop the [[vaudeville]] shows of the late 1800s to the early 1900s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to the "wench players", minstrel shows developed the role of "prima donnas", who appeared more elegant and refined while still retaining their comedic elements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  While the "wenches" were purely American creations, the "prima donnas" were inspired by both American and European cross-dressing shows, like [[Shakespearean]] actors and [[castrati]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With the United States shifting demographics, including the shift from farms to cities, [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of African Americans, and an influx of [[immigration to the United States|immigrants]], vaudeville's broad comedy and music expanded the audience from minstrelsy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

With vaudeville becoming more popular, it allowed female impersonators to become popular as well. Many female impersonators started with low comedy in vaudeville and worked their way up to perform as the prima donna.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Moore, F. Michael. ''Drag!: Male and Female Impersonators on Stage, Screen, and Television: An Illustrated World History''. Jefferson, N.C: McFarland &amp; Company, 1994.{{ISBN?}}{{page needed|date=June 2020}}
&lt;/ref&gt; They were known to perform song and dance routines with multiple outfit changes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In New York City, famous female impersonator [[Julian Eltinge]] found success, and he eventually made his way to the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage performing as a woman.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He published a magazine, ''Magazine and Beauty Hints'' (1913), which provided beauty and fashion tips, and he posed for corset and cosmetics advertisements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Meanwhile, in San Francisco, [[Bothwell Browne]] was the top female impersonator of the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. He performed at the Grand Opera House and Central Theater, among other venues, went on tour with United Vaudeville, and later appeared in the film [[Yankee Doodle in Berlin]] (1919), produced by [[Mack Sennett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Boyd|first=Nan Alamilla|url=https://archive.org/details/wideopentownhist00boyd|title=Wide Open Town: A History of Queer San Francisco to 1965|publisher=University of California Press|year=2003|isbn=0-520-24474-5|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time being a female impersonator was seen as something for the straight white male, and any deviation was punished.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Connection with [[sex work]] and [[homosexuality]] eventually led to the decline of vaudeville during the [[Progressive Era]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both the minstrelsy and vaudeville eras of female impersonation led to an association with music, dance, and comedy that still lasts today.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Night clubs ====
In the early to mid-1900s, female impersonation had become tied to the [[LGBT community]] and thus criminality, so it had to change forms and locations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  It moved from being popular mainstream entertainment to something done only at night in disreputable areas, such as San Francisco's [[Tenderloin, San Francisco|Tenderloin]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Here female impersonation started to evolve into what we today know as [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] and drag queens.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Baker, Roger.

==== Protests ====
{{Main|Cooper Donuts Riot|Compton's Cafeteria riot|Stonewall riots|Invasion of the Pines}}
The [[Cooper Donuts Riot]] was a May 1959 incident in Los Angeles in which drag queens, lesbians, transgender women, and gay men rioted; it was one of the first [[LGBT]] protests in the United States.&lt;ref name="Out"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moffitt|first1=Evan|date=31 May 2015|title=10 Years Before Stonewall, There Was the Cooper's Donuts Riot|work=Out Magazine|agency=Here Media Inc.|url=https://www.out.com/today-gay-history/2015/5/31/today-gay-history-10-years-stonewall-there-was-coopers-donuts-riot|url-status=live|access-date=30 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621211159/https://www.out.com/today-gay-history/2015/5/31/today-gay-history-10-years-stonewall-there-was-coopers-donuts-riot|archive-date=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Compton's Cafeteria riot]], which involved drag queens and others, occurred in San Francisco in 1966.&lt;ref name="boyd"&gt;Boyd, Nan Alamilla (2004). "San Francisco" in the ''Encyclopedia of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered History in America'', Ed. Marc Stein. Vol. 3. Charles Scribner's Sons. pp. 71–78.&lt;/ref&gt; It marked the beginning of [[transgender]] activism in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="boyd" /&gt;

On 17 March 1968, in Los Angeles, to protest [[entrapment]] and harassment by the LAPD, two drag queens known as "The Princess" and "The Duchess" held a St. Patrick's Day party at [[Griffith Park]], a popular [[cruising for sex|cruising]] spot and a frequent target of police activity. More than 200 gay men socialized through the day.&lt;ref&gt;Witt, Lynn, Sherry Thomas and Eric Marcus (eds.) (1995). ''Out in All Directions: The Almanac of Gay and Lesbian America'', p. 210. New York, Warner Books. {{ISBN|0-446-67237-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drag queens were also involved in the [[Stonewall riots]], a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the [[LGBT community]] against a [[police raid]] that took place in the early morning hours of 28 June 1969, at the [[Stonewall Inn]], located in the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], New York City. The riots are widely considered to be the catalyst for the [[gay liberation]] movement and the modern fight for [[LGBT rights in the United States]].&lt;ref name="diversity"&gt;{{cite web|author=National Park Service|year=2008|title=Workforce Diversity: The Stonewall Inn, National Historic Landmark National Register Number: 99000562|url=http://www.nps.gov/diversity/stonewall.htm|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306222059/http://www.nps.gov/diversity/stonewall.htm|archive-date=6 March 2016|access-date=21 January 2013|publisher=US Department of Interior}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=21 January 2013|title=Obama inaugural speech references Stonewall gay-rights riots|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/2012_Presidential_Election/Obama_inaugural_speech_references_Stonewall_riots.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723025158/http://www.northjersey.com/news/2012_Presidential_Election/Obama_inaugural_speech_references_Stonewall_riots.html|archive-date=23 July 2013|access-date=21 January 2013|publisher=North Jersey Media Group Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 1976, a restaurant in [[Fire Island Pines, New York|Fire Island Pines]], [[New York (state)|New York]], denied entry to a visitor in drag named Terry Warren. When Warren's friends in Cherry Grove heard what had happened, they dressed up in drag, and, on [[United States Bicentennial|4 July 1976]], sailed to the Pines by [[water taxi]]. This turned into a yearly event where drag queens go to the Pines, called the [[Invasion of the Pines]].

As such, drag mothers and drag daughters have a [[mentorship|mentor]]-apprentice relationship. This is because drag mothers help hone the skills of their younger queens, or drag daughters, by teaching them things such as how to apply makeup, walk in heels, sew clothing, dance, sing etc. In addition to this, drag mothers also promote their drag children at events and performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Networks |first=Hornet |date=2021-08-06 |title=‘Call Me Mother’: How Drag Mothers Are Raising a New Generation of Queens |url=https://hornet.com/stories/drag-mothers/ |access-date=2022-11-29 |website=Hornet |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of getting into drag or into character can take hours. A drag queen may aim for a certain style, celebrity impression, or message with their look. Hair, make-up, and costumes are the most important essentials for drag queens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2002/10/03/dude-diva-how-become-drag-queen |title=Dude to Diva: How to Become a Drag Queen &amp;#124; The Chronicle |publisher=Dukechronicle.com |access-date=1 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307024947/http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2002/10/03/dude-diva-how-become-drag-queen |archive-date=7 March 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Drag queens tend to go for a more exaggerated look with a lot more makeup than a typical woman would wear.

== In education ==
While drag queens are entertainers, they play a role in educating people on gender roles and stereotyping. Professor Stephen Schacht of Plattsburgh State University of New York began introducing his and his students' experiences of attending a drag show to his gender/sexualities class to challenge his students' ideas of dichotomy. Over time he began inviting students to attend with him. He gathered from his students that after attending the drag show they had a new appreciation for gender and sexuality and often become very vocal about their new experiences in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Browse journals by subject |journal=Journal of Homosexuality |volume=46 |issue=3–4 |pages=225–240 |doi=10.1300/J082v46n03_14 |pmid=15132493 |year = 2004|last1 = Schacht|first1 = Steven P.|s2cid=38596592 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== With children ===
[[Nina West]], ''Drag Race'' season eleven contestant and winner of ''Miss Congeniality'', and producer of ''[[Drag Is Magic]]'', an EP of children's music about the art form, says she hopes to inspire them to "dream big, be kind, and be their perfect selves."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nina-west-drag-is-magic-video_n_5ce30897e4b075a35a2bd851|title=Nina West Of 'RuPaul's Drag Race' Wants Kids To Feel 'Loved And Seen' With New Video|last=Wong|first=Curtis M.|date=21 May 2019|website=[[HuffPost]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190908171245/https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nina-west-drag-is-magic-video_n_5ce30897e4b075a35a2bd851|archive-date=8 September 2019|access-date=9 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; West feels the art form is "an opportunity for children to get creative and think outside the boxes us silly adults have crafted for them."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Marti Gould Cummings]] said something similar when a video of them performing "[[Baby Shark]]" at a drag brunch event went [[Viral video|viral]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/baby-shark-drag-queen-brunch_n_5c893c7ee4b038892f49caa9|title=Drag Queen Performs 'Baby Shark' At 2-Year-Old's Request, And It's Delightful|last=Wong|first=Curtis M.|date=19 March 2019|website=[[HuffPost]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190614202754/https://www.huffpost.com/entry/baby-shark-drag-queen-brunch_n_5c893c7ee4b038892f49caa9|archive-date=14 June 2019|access-date=9 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Anyone who thinks drag isn't for children is wrong," said Cummings, "Drag is expression, and children are such judgment-free beings; they don't really care what you're wearing, just what you're performing."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As of May 2019, the video has been viewed over 806,000 times.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

West responded to critics who question if children are too young to experience drag, saying "Drag is an opportunity for anyone – including and especially children – to reconsider the masks we are all forced to wear daily."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; West added, "Children are inundated with implicit imagery from media about what is 'boy' and what is 'girl.' And I believe that almost all kids are really less concerned about playing with a toy that's supposedly aligned to their gender, and more concerned with playing with toys that speak to them."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

John Casey, an adjunct professor at [[Wagner College]] in New York City, posits in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'',{{Blockquote|"[Drag queens] are incredibly talented, and they are trying to live their lives, and in the process, brighten the lives of those around them. That's the message parents should be communicating to their kids, at any age. It's all about acceptance and being loved for who you are."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.advocate.com/commentary/2019/9/17/exposing-kids-drag-isnt-abuse|title=Exposing Kids to Drag Isn't Abuse|last=Casey|first=John|date=September 17, 2019|website=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190921225932/https://www.advocate.com/commentary/2019/9/17/exposing-kids-drag-isnt-abuse|archive-date=September 21, 2019|access-date=September 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, as of 2022, exposing kids to drag has become somewhat controversial. Lawmakers in states such has Florida, Arizona, Texas are attempting to ban minors from attending drag shows and punish parents who expose their kids to drag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Barco |first=Mandalit del |date=2022-06-16 |title=Some lawmakers hope to crack down on drag shows watched by children |language=en |work=NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/2022/06/16/1105544325/drag-shows-children |access-date=2022-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These attempts to ban minors from watching drag are based on allegations of drag being a form of perversion and hyper-sexualization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Barco |first=Mandalit del |date=2022-06-16 |title=Some lawmakers hope to crack down on drag shows watched by children |language=en |work=NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/2022/06/16/1105544325/drag-shows-children |access-date=2022-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who disagree have argued that drag queens provide a safe and creative environment for young children, especially LGBTQ+ children, and are a source of both education and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Barco |first=Mandalit del |date=2022-06-16 |title=Some lawmakers hope to crack down on drag shows watched by children |language=en |work=NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/2022/06/16/1105544325/drag-shows-children |access-date=2022-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An event in recent news in the state of California details the invasion of a drag story time event with children by men belonging to the far-right group known as [[Proud Boys]]. The County Sheriff's Office opened a hate crime investigation into the incident after homophobic and transphobic statements were made, endangering both the drag queen reading to the children, and the children themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Barco |first=Mandalit del |date=2022-06-16 |title=Some lawmakers hope to crack down on drag shows watched by children |language=en |work=NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/2022/06/16/1105544325/drag-shows-children |access-date=2022-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separately from kids watching drag, the phenomena of drag kids is relatively recent, ''The New York Times'' notes that as of September 2019 there are over a hundred public drag children in the U.S., with [[Desmond is Amazing]] as the one with the most followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/07/style/self-care/drag-kids-desmond-the-amazing.html|title=Sashaying Their Way Through Youth|last=Hines|first=Alice|date=7 September 2019|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=9 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190909054506/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/07/style/self-care/drag-kids-desmond-the-amazing.html|archive-date=9 September 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mainstream access to drag queens on television exponentially increased in 2009 when ''RuPaul's Drag Race s''tarted airing.
