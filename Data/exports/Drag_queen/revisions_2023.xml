A '''drag queen''' is a person, usually male,&lt;!-- NOTE: "Usually male" is used because drag queens are most commonly men; they most commonly identify as male. The "usually" text is the result of extensive talk page discussion and reaching a compromise. If wanting to change this to be broader in its gender application, please discuss on the talk page first. But the viewpoint that drag queens may be of any gender or orientation is already here in the lede. --&gt;  who uses [[Drag (clothing)|drag clothing]] and makeup to imitate and often exaggerate [[femininity|female gender signifiers]] and [[gender roles]] for entertainment purposes. Historically, drag queens have usually been [[gay men]], and have been a part of [[gay culture]].

People [[Drag (clothing)|do drag]] for reasons ranging from self-expression to mainstream performance. [[Drag show]]s frequently include [[lip sync|lip-syncing]], live singing, and dancing. They typically occur at [[gay pride parades|LGBT pride parades]], [[drag pageants]], [[cabaret]]s, [[carnival]]s, and [[discotheque|nightclub]]s. Drag queens vary by type, culture, and dedication, from professionals who star in films and spend a lot of their time in their drag personas, to people who do drag only occasionally. Women who dress as men and entertain by imitating them are called [[drag king]]s.

Those who do occasional drag may be from other backgrounds than the LGBT community. There is a long history of [[Drag (clothing)#In folk custom|folkloric]] and [[Drag (clothing)#Theatre|theatrical]] crossdressing that involves people of all orientations. Not everyone who does drag at some point in their lives is a drag queen or a drag king.

===Drag===
Drag refers to an entertainment style wearing stylized clothing.

===Drag queens and kings===
In 1971, an article in [[Lee Brewster]]'s ''Drag Queens'' magazine described a drag queen as a "homosexual [[transvestite]]" who is hyperfeminine, flamboyant, and militant.&lt;ref name="dq_1_1_11_12"&gt;{{cite magazine |editor1-last=Brewster |editor1-first=Lee G. |editor2-last=Gybbons |editor2-first=Kay |editor3-last=McAllister |editor3-first=Laura |date=1971 |title=Drag Queen vs. Transvestite |magazine=Drag Queens: A Magazine About the Transvestite |volume=1 |issue=1 |publisher=Queens Publications |publication-place=New York, NY |pages=11–12 |url=https://archive.org/details/drag11unse/page/10/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dq_1_4_29_30"&gt;{{cite magazine |editor1-last=Brewster |editor1-first=Lee G. |editor2-last=Gybbons |editor2-first=Kay |editor3-last=McAllister |editor3-first=Laura |date=1971 |title=Drag Queen vs. Transvestite |magazine=Drag: A Magazine About the Transvestite |volume=1 |issue=4 |publisher=Queens Publications |publication-place=New York, NY |pages=29–30 |url=https://archive.org/details/drag14unse/page/28/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drag queens were further described as having an attitude of superiority, and commonly courted by heterosexual men who would "not ordinarily participate in homosexual relationships".&lt;ref name="dq_1_1_11_12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dq_1_4_29_30"/&gt; While the term ''drag queen'' implied "homosexual transvestite", the term ''drag'' carried no such connotations.&lt;ref name="dq_2_6_4"&gt;{{cite magazine |editor1-last=Brewster |editor1-first=Lee G. |editor2-last=Gybbons |editor2-first=Kay |editor3-last=McAllister |editor3-first=Laura |date=1971 |title=Editorial: Drag |magazine=Drag: A Magazine About the Transvestite |volume=2 |issue=6 |publisher=Queens Publications |publication-place=New York, NY |page=4 |url=https://archive.org/details/drag00leeg_0/page/4/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, ''drag queen'' was continually defined as a "homosexual transvestite".&lt;ref name="newton_3"&gt;{{cite book |last=Newton |first=Esther |title=Mother Camp: Female Impersonators in America |year=1972 |location=Chicago, IL |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |page=3 |isbn=9780226577609 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Drag'' was parsed as changing one's clothes to those of a different sex, while ''[[queen (slang)|queen]]'' was said to refer to a homosexual man.&lt;ref name="newton_3"/&gt;

For much of history, drag queens were men, but in more modern times, [[cisgender]] and [[Trans woman|trans women]], as well as [[Non-binary gender|non-binary]] people, also perform as drag queens.&lt;ref name="Guardian-MBH"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/08/rupaul-drag-race-transgender-performers-diversity |title=Who can be a drag queen?

Drag queens' counterparts are [[drag kings]]: performers, usually women, who dress in exaggeratedly masculine clothing. Examples of drag kings include [[Landon Cider]]. Trans men who dress like drag kings are sometimes termed trans kings.

===Female impersonator===
The term ''female impersonator'' was commonly used in the past. In 1972, Esther Newton described a ''female impersonator'' as a "professional drag queen".&lt;ref name="newton_3"/&gt; She considered the term ''female impersonator'' to be the one that was (then) widely understood by heterosexual audiences.&lt;ref name="newton_3"/&gt;

Female impersonation can be traced back at least as far as ancient Greece. There was little to no gender equity then and women held a lower social status. This meant male actors would play female roles during theatrical performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Gewertz|first=Ken|date=17 July 2003|title=When men were men (and women, too)|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2003/07/when-men-were-men-and-women-too/|access-date=10 February 2022|website=The Harvard Gazette|archive-date=11 February 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220211052711/https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2003/07/when-men-were-men-and-women-too/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition continued for centuries but began to be less prevalent as motion pictures became popular. During the era of [[vaudeville]] it was considered immodest for women to appear on stage. Due to that circumstance, some men became famous as "female impersonators", the most notable being [[Julian Eltinge]]. At the peak of his career he was one of the most sought after and highest paid actors in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Goodman|first=Elyssa|date=6 April 2018|title=Drag Herstory: This Drag Queen Was Once the Highest Paid Actor in the World|url=https://www.them.us/story/julian-eltinge-drag-queen-history|access-date=10 February 2022|website=them.|archive-date=11 February 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220211051829/https://www.them.us/story/julian-eltinge-drag-queen-history|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female impersonation has been and continues to be illegal in some places, which inspired the drag queen [[José Sarria]] to hand out labels to his friends reading, "I am a boy", so they could not be accused of female impersonation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sarria_j.html |title=&gt;&gt; social sciences &gt;&gt; Sarria, José |publisher=glbtq |date=12 December 1923 |access-date=1 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203005833/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sarria_j.html |archive-date=3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American drag queen [[RuPaul]] once said, "I do not impersonate females! How many women do you know who wear seven-inch heels, four-foot wigs, and skintight dresses?" He also said, "I don't dress like a woman; I dress like a drag queen!"&lt;ref&gt;Susan Corso (15 April 2009).

===Alternative terms===
[[File:Khookha McQueer autoportrait 5.jpg|thumb|[[Khookha McQueer]], Tunisian drag queen]]
Some drag queens may prefer to be referred to as "[[gender-specific pronoun|she]]" while in drag and desire to stay completely in character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://transequality.org/issues/resources/understanding-drag |title=Understanding Drag |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=28 April 2017 |website=transequality.org |publisher=National Center for Transgender Equality |access-date=13 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310044748/https://transequality.org/issues/resources/understanding-drag |archive-date=10 March 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other drag performers are indifferent to which pronoun is used to refer to them.

Among drag queens and their contacts today, there is an ongoing debate about whether transgender drag queens are actually considered "drag queens". Some argue that, because a drag queen is defined as a man portraying a woman, transgender women cannot be drag queens. [[Drag king]]s are women who assume a masculine aesthetic, but this is not always the case, because there are also biokings, bioqueens, and [[Female queen (drag)|female queens]], which are people who perform their own biological sex through a heightened or exaggerated gender presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.4324/9780203057094|title=The Drag Queen Anthology|year=2013|last1=Underwood|first1=Lisa|isbn=9780203057094}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://academic.eb.com/?target=%2Flevels%2Fcollegiate%2Farticle%2Fdrag-queen%2F627517|title=Britannica Academic|website=academic.eb.com|access-date=5 December 2018|archive-date=22 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200922085318/https://academic.eb.com/?target=%2Flevels%2Fcollegiate%2Farticle%2Fdrag-queen%2F627517|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Joshua Trey|last2=Johnson|first2=Corey W.|date=November 2013|title=We Are All Royalty|journal=Journal of Leisure Research|volume=45|issue=5|pages=677–694|doi=10.18666/jlr-2013-v45-i5-4369|s2cid=143305970|issn=0022-2216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of drag ==

=== Ancient Greece ===
The concept of drag can be seen in the earliest forms of entertainment, including [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek theatre]]. In ancient western cultures, women often were not allowed to perform onstage or become actors, therefore male actors played the roles of women also.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{Cite web |last=thedifferentlevel |date=2021-09-01 |title=History of Drag: From Antic Greece to RuPaul's Drag Race |url=https://different-level.com/history-of-drag-from-antic-greece-to-rupauls-drag-race/ |access-date=2022-12-02 |website=LEVEL |language=en-US |archive-date=5 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230405033506/https://different-level.com/history-of-drag-from-antic-greece-to-rupauls-drag-race/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstrates how female impersonation can be traced back to the earliest forms of entertainment and spectacle.

There is some controversy as to whether this is actually where drag emerged, or if it occurred later in history in the 1800s with forms of entertainment such as [[minstrel show]]s and Shakespeare's plays, as he often incorporated male actors as female impersonators.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In the late 1800s to the mid-1900s, [[pantomime dame]]s became a popular form of female impersonation in Europe.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This was the first era of female impersonation in Europe to use comedy as part of the performance, contrasting with the serious [[Shakespearean tragedy|Shakespearean tragedies]] and [[Italian opera]]s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The dame became a [[stock character]] with a range of attitudes from "[[charwoman]]" to "[[grande dame]]" that mainly was used for improvisation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The most famous and successful pantomime dame was [[Dan Leno]]. After World War I and World War II, the theatre and movie scenes were changing, and the use of pantomime dames declined.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Pantomime]], complete with dames, remains a popular form of theatre - traditionally performed at [[Christmas]] and afterwards - to family audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, David (2002). "British Culture: An Introduction", p. 74, Routledge; and [https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21636788-understand-britishand-have-fungo-and-see-christmas-pantomime-its-behind-you "It's Behind You"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815101055/https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21636788-understand-britishand-have-fungo-and-see-christmas-pantomime-its-behind-you |date=15 August 2017 }}, ''The Economist'', 20 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond theatre, in the 1800s, [[Molly house]]s became a place for gay men to meet, often dressed in drag.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite web |title=A brief but glamorous history of drag |url=https://www.history.co.uk/articles/a-brief-but-glamorous-history-of-drag |access-date=2022-12-02 |website=Sky HISTORY TV channel |language=en |archive-date=15 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230515145054/https://www.history.co.uk/articles/a-brief-but-glamorous-history-of-drag |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite gayness being outlawed, men would dress in women's clothing and attend these taverns and coffee houses to congregate and meet with other queer people (mostly gay men).&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

=== South Africa ===
Drag in South Africa emerged in the 1950s in major cities such as [[Johannesburg]] and [[Cape Town]].&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Drag in South Africa: The Art of Expression |url=https://www.queermajority.com/essays-all/drag-in-south-africa-the-art-of-expression |access-date=2022-12-02 |website=Queer Majority |date=30 September 2020 |language=en-US |archive-date=2 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221202212640/https://www.queermajority.com/essays-all/drag-in-south-africa-the-art-of-expression |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; It started in the form of underground pageants which created a safe space for members of the LGBTQ+ community in [[Apartheid]] South Africa, where people could be punished by law for being gay.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Being gay was not legalized in South Africa until 1998, so pageants, such as the famous Miss Gay Western Cape, did not become official until the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=McCormick |first=T.

Discrimination against drag is widespread in South Africa, and drag queens face the threat of violence by being openly gay. Furthermore, there is not language to explore queerness in [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]], one of the indigenous languages of South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Olwage |first1=Lee-Ann |last2=Ingber |first2=Sasha |date=2019-09-20 |title=PHOTOS: Drag Queens In South Africa Embrace Queerness And Tradition |language=en |work=NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/09/20/761990035/photos-drag-queens-in-south-africa-embrace-queerness-and-tradition |access-date=2022-12-02 |archive-date=2 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221202212639/https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/09/20/761990035/photos-drag-queens-in-south-africa-embrace-queerness-and-tradition |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thailand ===
After homosexual acts were decriminalized in Thailand in 1956, gay clubs and other queer spaces began opening which lead to the first cabaret. However, drag in Thailand was actually heavily influenced by drag queens from the Philippines as the first drag show started after the owner of a gay club saw drag queens from the Philippines perform in [[Bangkok]].&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Thailand's Drag Shows: Testimony to Survival and Culture Redefined |url=https://www.thailandfoundation.or.th/culture_heritage/thailands-drag-shows-testimony-to-survival-and-culture-redefined/ |access-date=2022-12-02 |website=Thailand Foundation |language=en-US |archive-date=9 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230509035506/https://www.thailandfoundation.or.th/culture_heritage/thailands-drag-shows-testimony-to-survival-and-culture-redefined/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, drag shows started in Thailand in the mid-1970s and have become increasingly popular over time, especially in major cities like Bangkok.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt;

=== Philippines ===
Before being colonized by Spain in the mid-1500s, it was a national custom for men to dress in women's clothing.&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;{{Cite web |last=COMMONER |date=2021-06-30 |title=Beyond the Glitz and Glamour: How Philippine Drag Has Evolved throughout the Years |url=https://mediacommoner.medium.com/beyond-the-glitz-and-glamour-how-philippine-drag-has-evolved-throughout-the-years-6eb867d7d658 |access-date=2022-12-02 |website=Medium |language=en |archive-date=2 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221202212644/https://mediacommoner.medium.com/beyond-the-glitz-and-glamour-how-philippine-drag-has-evolved-throughout-the-years-6eb867d7d658 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the Spaniards arrived, they not only outlawed homosexuality but executed men that appeared to be homosexual. Spain cast a culture of [[Machismo]] onto the Philippines, causing any kind of queerness and queer culture to be heavily suppressed.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt;

Nonetheless, in the early 1900s drag started to reappear in the media. Drag became a key element of national pantomime theatre and as time went on, drag queens appeared in other forms of theatre and in movies.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt;

=== Canada ===
In the 1940s [[John Herbert (playwright)|John Herbert]], who sometimes competed in drag pageants, was the victim of an attempted robbery while he was dressed as a woman.&lt;ref name="theatre"&gt;[http://www.canadiantheatre.com/dict.pl?term=John%20Herbert John Herbert] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220507080727/https://www.canadiantheatre.com/dict.pl?term=John%20Herbert |date=7 May 2022 }} at the Canadian Theatre Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|One source asserts that the attack occurred in 1947,&lt;ref name="theatre" /&gt; another is vague on the timing,&lt;ref name="BodyPolitic" /&gt; and ''The New York Times'' obituary of Herbert asserts that it occurred during Herbert's teens.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/27/theater/john-herbert-dies-at-75-wrote-of-prison-life.html "John Herbert Dies at 75; Wrote of Prison Life"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221124123526/https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/27/theater/john-herbert-dies-at-75-wrote-of-prison-life.html |date=24 November 2022 }}.

In 1977 the Canadian film ''[[Outrageous!]]'', starring drag queen [[Craig Russell (Canadian actor)|Craig Russell]], became one of the first gay-themed films to break out into mainstream theatrical release.

=== United States ===
==== First drag balls ====
The first person known to describe himself as "the queen of drag" was [[William Dorsey Swann]], born enslaved in [[Hancock, Maryland]], who in the 1880s started hosting [[Ball culture|drag balls]] in [[Washington, DC]] attended by other men who were formerly enslaved.

He requested a pardon from [[Grover Cleveland|President Grover Cleveland]], but was denied.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

With vaudeville becoming more popular, it allowed female impersonators to become popular as well. Many female impersonators started with low comedy in vaudeville and worked their way up to perform as the prima donna.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Moore, F. Michael.

&lt;/ref&gt; They were known to perform song and dance routines with multiple outfit changes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In [[New York City]], famous female impersonator [[Julian Eltinge]] found success, and he eventually made his way to the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage performing as a woman.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

He published a magazine, ''Magazine and Beauty Hints'' (1913), which provided beauty and fashion tips, and he posed for corset and cosmetics advertisements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Meanwhile, in [[San Francisco]], [[Bothwell Browne]] was the top female impersonator of the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. He performed at the Grand Opera House and Central Theater, among other venues, went on tour with United Vaudeville, and later appeared in the film [[Yankee Doodle in Berlin]] (1919), produced by [[Mack Sennett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Boyd|first=Nan Alamilla|url=https://archive.org/details/wideopentownhist00boyd|title=Wide Open Town: A History of Queer San Francisco to 1965|publisher=University of California Press|year=2003|isbn=0-520-24474-5|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time being a female impersonator was seen as something for the straight white male, and any deviation was punished.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Connection with [[sex work]] and [[homosexuality]] eventually led to the decline of vaudeville during the [[Progressive Era]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both the minstrelsy and vaudeville eras of female impersonation led to an association with music, dance, and comedy that still lasts today.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Night clubs ====
In the early to mid-1900s, female impersonation had become tied to the [[LGBT community]] and thus criminality, so it had to change forms and locations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  It moved from being popular mainstream entertainment to something done only at night in disreputable areas, such as San Francisco's [[Tenderloin, San Francisco|Tenderloin]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Here female impersonation started to evolve into what we today know as [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] and drag queens.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Baker, Roger.

==== Protests ====
{{Main|Cooper Donuts Riot|Compton's Cafeteria riot|Stonewall riots|Invasion of the Pines}}
The [[Cooper Donuts Riot]] was a May 1959 incident in [[Los Angeles]] in which drag queens, lesbians, transgender women, and gay men rioted; it was one of the first [[LGBT]] protests in the United States.&lt;ref name="Out"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moffitt|first1=Evan|date=31 May 2015|title=10 Years Before Stonewall, There Was the Cooper's Donuts Riot|work=Out Magazine|agency=Here Media Inc.|url=https://www.out.com/today-gay-history/2015/5/31/today-gay-history-10-years-stonewall-there-was-coopers-donuts-riot|url-status=live|access-date=30 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621211159/https://www.out.com/today-gay-history/2015/5/31/today-gay-history-10-years-stonewall-there-was-coopers-donuts-riot|archive-date=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Compton's Cafeteria riot]], which involved drag queens and others, occurred in San Francisco in 1966.&lt;ref name="boyd"&gt;Boyd, Nan Alamilla (2004). "San Francisco" in the ''Encyclopedia of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered History in America'', Ed. Marc Stein. Vol. 3. Charles Scribner's Sons. pp. 71–78.&lt;/ref&gt; It marked the beginning of [[transgender]] activism in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="boyd" /&gt;

On 17 March 1968, in Los Angeles, to protest [[entrapment]] and harassment by the [[Los Angeles Police Department]], two drag queens known as "The Princess" and "The Duchess" held a St. Patrick's Day party at [[Griffith Park]], a popular [[cruising for sex|cruising]] spot and a frequent target of police activity. More than 200 gay men socialized through the day.&lt;ref&gt;Witt, Lynn, Sherry Thomas and Eric Marcus (eds.) (1995). ''Out in All Directions: The Almanac of Gay and Lesbian America'', p. 210. New York, Warner Books. {{ISBN|0-446-67237-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drag queens were also involved in the [[Stonewall riots]], a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the [[LGBT community]] against a [[police raid]] that took place in the early morning hours of 28 June 1969, at the [[Stonewall Inn]], located in the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], New York City. The riots are widely considered to be the catalyst for the [[gay liberation]] movement and the modern fight for [[LGBT rights in the United States]].&lt;ref name="diversity"&gt;{{cite web |author=National Park Service |year=2008 |title=Workforce Diversity: The Stonewall Inn, National Historic Landmark National Register Number: 99000562 |url=http://www.nps.gov/diversity/stonewall.htm |url-status=deviated |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306222059/http://www.nps.gov/diversity/stonewall.htm |archive-date=6 March 2016 |access-date=21 January 2013 |publisher=US Department of Interior}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=21 January 2013 |title=Obama inaugural speech references Stonewall gay-rights riots |url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/2012_Presidential_Election/Obama_inaugural_speech_references_Stonewall_riots.html |url-status=deviated |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723025158/http://www.northjersey.com/news/2012_Presidential_Election/Obama_inaugural_speech_references_Stonewall_riots.html |archive-date=23 July 2013 |access-date=21 January 2013 |publisher=North Jersey Media Group Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 1976, a restaurant in [[Fire Island Pines, New York|Fire Island Pines]], [[New York (state)|New York]], denied entry to a visitor in drag named Terry Warren. When Warren's friends in Cherry Grove heard what had happened, they dressed up in drag, and, on [[United States Bicentennial|4 July 1976]], sailed to the Pines by [[water taxi]]. This turned into a yearly event where drag queens go to the Pines, called the [[Invasion of the Pines]].{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

As such, drag mothers and drag daughters have a [[mentorship|mentor]]-apprentice relationship. This is because drag mothers help hone the skills of their younger queens, or drag daughters, by teaching them things such as how to apply makeup, walk in heels, sew clothing, dance, sing etc. In addition to this, drag mothers also promote their drag children at events and performances.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;

The process of getting into drag or into character can take hours. A drag queen may aim for a certain style, celebrity impression, or message with their look. Hair, make-up, and costumes are the most important essentials for drag queens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2002/10/03/dude-diva-how-become-drag-queen |title=Dude to Diva: How to Become a Drag Queen &amp;#124; The Chronicle |publisher=Dukechronicle.com |access-date=1 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307024947/http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2002/10/03/dude-diva-how-become-drag-queen |archive-date=7 March 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Drag queens tend to go for a more exaggerated look with a lot more makeup than a typical woman would wear.

== In education ==
While drag queens are entertainers, they play a role in educating people on gender roles and stereotyping. Professor Stephen Schacht of [[State University of New York at Plattsburgh|Plattsburgh State University of New York]] began introducing his and his students' experiences of attending a drag show to his gender/sexualities class to challenge his students' ideas of dichotomy. Over time he began inviting students to attend with him. He gathered from his students that after attending the drag show they had a new appreciation for gender and sexuality and often become very vocal about their new experiences in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Browse journals by subject |journal=Journal of Homosexuality |volume=46 |issue=3–4 |pages=225–240 |doi=10.1300/J082v46n03_14 |pmid=15132493 |year = 2004|last1 = Schacht|first1 = Steven P.|s2cid=38596592 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

West responded to critics who question if children are too young to experience drag, saying "Drag is an opportunity for anyone – including and especially children – to reconsider the masks we are all forced to wear daily."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; West added, "Children are inundated with implicit imagery from media about what is 'boy' and what is 'girl.' And I believe that almost all kids are really less concerned about playing with a toy that's supposedly aligned to their gender, and more concerned with playing with toys that speak to them."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

John Casey, an adjunct professor at [[Wagner College]] in New York City, posits in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'',{{Blockquote|"[Drag queens] are incredibly talented, and they are trying to live their lives, and in the process, brighten the lives of those around them. That's the message parents should be communicating to their kids, at any age.

Separately from kids watching drag, the phenomena of drag kids is relatively recent,{{vague|date=January 2023}} ''The New York Times'' in September 2019 published a guess that a there are about a hundred children who do drag in the U.S., with [[Desmond is Amazing]] being the one with the most followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/07/style/self-care/drag-kids-desmond-the-amazing.html|title=Sashaying Their Way Through Youth|last=Hines|first=Alice|date=7 September 2019|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=9 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190909054506/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/07/style/self-care/drag-kids-desmond-the-amazing.html|archive-date=9 September 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mainstream access to drag queens on television exponentially increased in 2009 when ''RuPaul's Drag Race'' started airing.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

However, as of 2022, exposing kids to drag has become somewhat controversial. Lawmakers in states such as Arizona, Florida, and Texas are attempting to ban minors from attending drag shows and punish parents who expose their kids to drag.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Barco |first=Mandalit del |date=2022-06-16 |title=Some lawmakers hope to crack down on drag shows watched by children |language=en |work=NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/2022/06/16/1105544325/drag-shows-children |access-date=2022-11-19 |archive-date=10 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230510005848/https://www.npr.org/2022/06/16/1105544325/drag-shows-children |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; These attempts to ban minors from watching drag are based on allegations of drag being a form of perversion and hyper-sexualization.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; Some have argued that these accusations are the same that were leveled against homosexual men since the [[lavender scare]] of the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Tensley |first=Brandon |date=2022-10-27 |title=How age-old homophobic language is being used to miseducate voters |url=https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/27/us/rhetoric-lgbtq-midterms-race-deconstructed-newsletter-reaj/index.html |access-date=2023-06-21 |website=CNN |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Timothy W. |date=2023-05-16 |title=Calling drag queens 'groomers' and 'pedophiles' is the latest in a long history of weaponising those terms against the LGBTIQA community |url=http://theconversation.com/calling-drag-queens-groomers-and-pedophiles-is-the-latest-in-a-long-history-of-weaponising-those-terms-against-the-lgbtiqa-community-205648 |access-date=2023-06-21 |website=The Conversation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who disagree with the accusations have argued that drag queens provide a safe and creative environment for young children, especially LGBTQ+ children, and are a source of both education and entertainment.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

==== Story time in libraries ====
In December 2015, Radar Productions and [[Michelle Tea]] developed the concept of [[Drag Queen Story Hour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lamarche |first1=Una |date=19 May 2017 |title=Drag Queen Story Hour Puts the Rainbow in Reading |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/style/drag-queen-story-hour-puts-the-rainbow-in-reading.html |url-status=live |access-date=22 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701150324/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/style/drag-queen-story-hour-puts-the-rainbow-in-reading.html |archive-date=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Launched at the [[San Francisco Public Library]], Drag Queen Story Hour was adopted by the [[Brooklyn Public Library]] in the summer of 2016, and has since traveled to various libraries, museums, bookstores, recreation centers, and parks across the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Drag Queen Story Hour |url=https://www.dragqueenstoryhour.org/#about |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602104444/https://www.dragqueenstoryhour.org/#about |archive-date=2 June 2017 |access-date=22 June 2017 |website=Drag Queen Story Hour – drag queens reading stories to children in libraries, schools, and bookstores |publisher=Drag Queen Story Hour}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Societal reception ==
Drag has come to be a celebrated and important aspect of modern gay life,&lt;ref name="JustBeAQueen"/&gt; but has also been criticized for degrading women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thecritic.co.uk/how-drag-degrades-women/ Article] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221024095225/https://thecritic.co.uk/how-drag-degrades-women/ |date=24 October 2022 }} by Dr Em in ''[[The Critic (modern magazine)|The Critic]]'' 2022-02-25&lt;/ref&gt; In the era of [[second-wave feminism]] some women "were angry and appalled by what they perceived as the charade of femininity expressed by some drag queens and transsexual women."&lt;ref name="Rudacille2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rudacille |first=Deborah |author-link=Deborah Rudacille |date=2005 |title=The Riddle of Gender: Science, Activism and Transgender Rights |location=New York |publisher=Pantheon Books |pages=162–163 |isbn=0375421629}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics compared drag to [[blackface]] and saw it "as a kind of gender [[minstrel show|minstrel]]."&lt;ref name="Rudacille2005" /&gt;

Many gay bars and clubs around the world hold drag shows as regular events or for special parties. Several "International Drag Day" holidays have been started over the years to promote the shows. In the United States, Drag Day is typically celebrated in early March.

A televised drag competition, ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]'', is the most successful program on the [[Logo (TV channel)|Logo]] television network. In 2016, the show won a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/rupauls-drag-race|title=RuPaul's Drag Race|website=Television Academy|access-date=28 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160928150709/http://www.emmys.com/shows/rupauls-drag-race|archive-date=28 September 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the show became the first show to win a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program]] and a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine  |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/8475768/rupauls-drag-race-emmys-win-reaction-tweets |title='RuPaul's Drag Race's Emmys Win: See The Best Reactions |magazine=Billboard |access-date=19 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919155810/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/8475768/rupauls-drag-race-emmys-win-reaction-tweets |archive-date=19 September 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-host-for-a-reality-or-reality-competition-program |title=Nominees/Winners &amp;#124; Television Academy |publisher=Emmys.com |access-date=19 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919070811/http://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-host-for-a-reality-or-reality-competition-program |archive-date=19 September 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-reality-competition-program |title=Nominees/Winners &amp;#124; Television Academy |publisher=Emmys.com |access-date=19 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919211627/https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-reality-competition-program |archive-date=19 September 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral panic ===
A moral panic called [[drag panic]] has emerged in the United States in relation to drag queen performers. It alleges that contact between children and drag queens would involve drag queens attempting to molest them or indoctrinate them into the "queer way of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tannehill |first=Brynn |date=January 12, 2023 |title=The Moral Panic We Cannot Ignore |url=https://www.damemagazine.com/2023/01/12/the-moral-panic-trans-backlash/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230414152941/https://www.damemagazine.com/2023/01/12/the-moral-panic-trans-backlash/ |archive-date=April 14, 2023 |access-date=April 14, 2023 |website=Dame Magazine |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This moral panic has also been linked to the [[LGBT grooming conspiracy theory]], also from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Romano |first=Aja |date=2022-04-21 |title=The right's moral panic over "grooming" invokes age-old homophobia |url=https://www.vox.com/culture/23025505/leftist-groomers-homophobia-satanic-panic-explained |access-date=2023-05-16 |website=Vox |language=en |archive-date=17 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230517125930/https://www.vox.com/culture/23025505/leftist-groomers-homophobia-satanic-panic-explained |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Empson |first=Olivia |date=2023-03-23 |title=Drag storytellers grapple with growing threats by Republicans and far right |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/23/us-drag-storytellers-face-growing-threats |access-date=2023-05-16 |issn=0261-3077 |archive-date=16 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230516090018/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/23/us-drag-storytellers-face-growing-threats |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
