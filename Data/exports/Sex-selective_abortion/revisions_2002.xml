determination by ultrasound that the fetus is a certain sex (usually female).  
It is believed to be responsible for at least part of the skewed birth
statistics in favor of males in Mainland China, India, Taiwan, and South Korea.
Although the practice is often illegal, laws against it are extremely difficult
to enforce.

The cause of sex-selective abortion are social in that a male is necessary to
carry on the family name and economic in that a male can work in the fields
and generate more income than females.  Another contributing factor is the
wide availablity of [[ultrasound]] in rural areas which makes it possible
to determine gender before birth.</rev></revisions></page></pages></query></api>
