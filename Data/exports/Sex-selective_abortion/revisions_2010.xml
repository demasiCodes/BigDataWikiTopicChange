'''Sex-selective abortion''' is the practice of terminating a pregnancy based upon the predicted sex of the fetus.  The selective abortion of female fetuses is most common in areas where cultural norms value male children over female children, &lt;ref name= "Goodkind"&gt;Goodkind, Daniel. (1999).

A 2005 study estimated that over 90 million females were "missing" from the expected population in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, India, Pakistan, South Korea and Taiwan alone, and suggested that sex-selective abortion plays a role in this deficit.&lt;ref name= "Gettis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/topics/pubs/Hudson&amp;denBoer.pdf Layout 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some research suggests that culture plays a larger role than economic conditions in gender preference and sex-selective abortion, because such deviations in sex ratios do not exist in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean.&lt;ref name= "Gettis"/&gt; Other demographers, however, argue that perceived gender imbalances may arise from the underreporting of female births, rather than sex-selective abortion or infanticide.&lt;ref&gt;M.

Sex-selective abortion was rare before the late 20th century, because of the difficulty of determining the sex of the fetus before birth, but [[ultrasound]] has made such selection easier. Prior to this, parents would alter family sex compositions through [[infanticide]]. Even today, there are no scientifically proven and commercialized practices that allow gender detection during the first trimester, and ultrasound is fairly unreliable until approximately the 20th week of pregnancy. Consequently, sex selection often requires late term abortion of a fetus close to the limit of viability.

Sex-selection practices are also believed by some to occur among South Asian immigrants in the United States, though there is a lack of evidence to prove such claims. A study of the 2000 United States Census observed definite male bias in families of Chinese, Korean and Indian immigrants, which was getting increasingly stronger in families where first one or two children were female. In those families where the first two children were girls, the sex ratio of the third child was observed to be 1.51:1 in favor of boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/15/nyregion/15babies.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;hp|title=U.S. Births Hint at Bias for Boys in Some Asians | work=The New York Times | first=Sam | last=Roberts | date=June 15, 2009 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Societal effects==
Gender bias can broadly impact a society, and it is estimated that by 2020 there could be more than 35 million young "surplus males" in [[China]] and 25 million in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://kennedy.byu.edu/bridges/pdfs/bridgesF2000.pdf Surplus Males: The Need for Balance]." (Fall 2000). ''Bridges.'' Retrieved March 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;.  

It is possible that sex-selective abortions have caused an increase in the imbalances between sex ratios of various Asian countries. Studies have estimated that prenatal sex selection has increased the ratio of males to females from the natural average of 105-106 males per 100 females to 113 males per 100 females in both South Korea and China, 110 males per 100 females in Taiwan and 107 males per 100 females among Chinese populations living in Singapore and parts of Malaysia.&lt;ref name="goodkind1"&gt;Goodkind, Daniel.

''Population and Development Review, 22 (1),'' 111-125. Retrieved March 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a similar trend does not exist in North Korea, possibly due to limited access to prenatal sex-testing technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Goodkind, Daniel. (1999).

During the 1994 [[United Nations]] [[International Conference on Population and Development]] in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], policy objectives intended to eliminate sex-selective abortion and infanticide, along with discrimination against female children, were stated in Article 4.15 of the [http://www.unfpa.org/icpd/icpd_poa.htm Programme of Action]: "...to eliminate all forms of discrimination against the girl child and the root causes of son preference, which results in harmful and unethical practices regarding female infanticide and prenatal sex selection".&lt;ref name="goodkind1" /&gt;

Sex-selective abortion has been seen as worsening the sex ratio in India, affecting gender issues related to sex compositions of Indian households.&lt;ref&gt;Sabarwal, Shwetlena.

Retrieved March 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2001 census, the sex-ratio in India is 107.8 males per 100 females, up from 105.8 males per 100 females in 1991. The ratio is significantly higher in certain [[States and territories of India|states]] such as [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] (126.1) and [[Haryana]] (122.0).&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Fred, Kishor, Sunita, &amp; Roy, T.

Retrieved March 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that by having a [[one-child policy]], China has increased the rate of abortion of female fetuses, thereby accelerating a demographic decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/353/11/1171 The Effect of China's One-Child Family Policy after 25 Years],  Therese Hesketh and Zhu Wei Xing, ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'', 2005-09-15.&lt;/ref&gt; As most Chinese families are given incentives to have only one child, and would often prefer at least one son.
