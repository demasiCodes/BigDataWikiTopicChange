'''Pinkwashing''' is a term used to describe the action of using [[gay]]-related issues in positive ways in order to distract attention from negative actions by an organization, country or government.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Schulman|first=Sarah|date=2011-11-23|title=Opinion {{!}} Israel and 'Pinkwashing' (Published 2011)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/23/opinion/pinkwashing-and-israels-use-of-gays-as-a-messaging-tool.html|access-date=2020-11-11|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[LGBT rights]], it is used to describe a variety of marketing and political strategies aimed at promoting products, countries, people or entities through an appeal to [[gay friendly|gay-friendliness]], in order to be perceived as progressive, modern and tolerant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This phrase, in reference to LGBT rights, was coined by [[Sarah Schulman]] in an op-ed piece for ''[[The New York Times]]'' entitled "Israel and Pinkwashing". This term is not to be confused with [[Pinkwashing (breast cancer)|pinkwashing]] in relation to breast cancer, which describes a company's campaigning for breast cancer awareness while they contribute to the production of chemical carcinogens.

== Immigration ==
In 2013, the [[Human Rights Campaign]] officially endorsed comprehensive immigration reform and committed to helping immigrants as they seek health and safety, asylum or citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Immigration |url=http://www.hrc.org/topics/immigration |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201091142/http://www.hrc.org/topics/immigration |archive-date=February 1, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The endorsement came days after an incident where a gay immigrant activist was prevented by HRC from discussing their legal status at a Supreme Court rally, mistreatment for which HRC later issued an apology. ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' described the HRC's actions as pinkwashing, "making immigration reform look pro-gay to garner LGBT support in order to mask the severe drawbacks of the legislation" – drawbacks such as funding to support enforcement, deportation, and further US militarization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Lal|first1=Prerna|last2=Attorney|first2=ContributorStaff|last3=Supervisor|first3=Clinical|last4=Center|first4=East Bay Community Law|date=2013-04-15|title=How Pinkwashing Masks The Retrograde Effects Of Immigration Reform|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pinkwashing-immigration-reform_b_3070788|access-date=2020-11-12|website=HuffPost|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Jason Kenney]], Canada's Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, was accused of pinkwashing after an email titled "LGBT Refugees from Iran" was sent to thousands of Canadians. The message contained additional recent comments by [[John Baird (Canadian politician)|John Baird]], Minister of Foreign Affairs, about Canada's stand against the persecution and marginalization of gays and lesbian and women around the world. A group of activists claimed that it "is a poor attempt at 'pinkwashing' the Conservative government's obvious desire to encourage war with Iran."

== Homonationalism ==
[[Homonationalism]] is a term coined by Jasbir Puar to describe a particular type of queer people that are white, ideal, and help to promote countries that use queer rights to seem more modern. In short, this is the intersection between gay identities and nationalist ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Nichols|first=James Michael|date=2016-10-05|title=Understanding Homonationalism: Why Are There Gay People Supporting Trump?|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gay-people-supporting-trump-homonationalism_n_57f3e545e4b01b16aaff4bff|access-date=2020-11-18|website=HuffPost|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jasbir Puar defined homonationalism in her book "Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in Queer Times", in 2007, before Sarah Schulman's article that coined pinkwashing. Homonationalism shaped the concept of pinkwashing and the two terms are often used together as tools to explain the actions of countries like Israel. Puar writes in a later article, "Rethinking Homonationalism", that the two terms are not parallel but rather pinkwashing is able to exist because homonationalism exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Puar|first=Jasbir|date=2013|title=Rethinking Homonationalism|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43302999|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|volume=45|issue=2|pages=336–339|doi=10.1017/S002074381300007X|jstor=43302999|s2cid=232253207|issn=0020-7438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{Expand section|date=February 2017}}
According to Omar G. Encarnación, a Professor of Political Studies at [[Bard College]], the [[Obama administration]] was accused by some critics of pinkwashing "to distract from other unsavory policies such as the deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants and the failure to prosecute those responsible for the human rights abuses of the Bush administration’s War on Terror."&lt;ref name="foreignaffairstrumpandgayrights"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Encarnación|first1=Omar G.|title=Trump and Gay Rights: The Future of the Global Movement|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2017-02-13/trump-and-gay-rights?cid=nlc-fatoday-20170213&amp;sp_mid=53412954&amp;sp_rid=dmljdG9yLnN0ZXBpZW5AZ21haWwuY29tS0|access-date=February 14, 2017|work=Foreign Affairs|date=February 13, 2017|quote=There is even the cynical charge that Obama engaged in “pink washing,” or the use of the gay rights issue to distract from other unsavory policies such as the deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants and the failure to prosecute those responsible for the human rights abuses of the Bush administration’s War on Terror.}} {{subscription required|via=Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinkwashing in the United States, according to author Stephan Dahl from the University of Hull, is centered around pride merchandise created and sold by companies that do nothing for queer people.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Dahl|first=Stephan|title=The rise of pride marketing and the curse of 'pink washing'|url=http://theconversation.com/the-rise-of-pride-marketing-and-the-curse-of-pink-washing-30925|access-date=2020-11-12|website=The Conversation|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This feeds a "big business small community" relationship and seems beneficial when in reality there is nothing changing legally for queer people through this practice.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Israeli government public relations==
[[File:משפריצות פעולה ורודה 2.jpg|thumb|[[Anarcho-queer]] collective ''Mashpritzot'' hold a "[[die-in]]" protest against Israeli pinkwashing and the perceived [[homonormativity|homonormative]] priorities of the [[LGBT]] support centre in [[Tel Aviv]].]]
[[Sarah Schulman]], a writer and professor at the [[City University of New York]], claims Israeli [[Public diplomacy (Israel)|government public relations campaign]] exploits Israel's supposed LGBT-friendliness to promote perceptions of Israel as a modern democracy, a secure place for investment, and a sunny tourist destination.&lt;ref&gt;Avraham, Eli. (2009), "Marketing and managing nation branding during prolonged crisis: The case of Israel". Vol. 5, 3, pp. 202–212.&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli marketing claims that LGBT people have more freedom in Israel than in most places and paints the state as an ideal place for queer couples to vacation without fear of oppression. The campaign has specifically targeted gay men between the ages of 18 to 34.

Schulman argues Israel does not have laws that benefit LGBT people more than in other countries and some politicians in Israel are homophobic. She contends the promotion of LGBT rights leads people to incorrectly assume that Israel is liberal when it may, in fact, violate other human rights, and that Israel's pinkwashing negatively affects LGBT people as well as Palestinians by suppressing demands for political change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In August 2011, ''The Jerusalem Post'' reported the Foreign Ministry was promoting Gay Israel as part of its campaigns to counter the negative stereotypes that many liberal Americans and Europeans have of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tovah |last=Lazaroff |date=October 26, 2006 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Foreign-Ministry-promoting-Gay-Israel |title=Foreign Ministry promoting Gay Israel |work=The Jerusalem Post |access-date=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of Israel like [[Jasbir Puar]], an associate professor of Women's and Gender Studies at [[Rutgers University]], cite the Israeli government's comparison of LGBT rights in Israel and in the [[occupied Palestinian territories]] as an example of pinkwashing. Citing WorldPride, which Jerusalem hosted in 2006, she writes: "Within global gay and lesbian organising circuits, to be gay friendly is to be modern, cosmopolitan, developed, first-world, global north, and, most significantly, democratic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/01/israels-gay-propaganda-war |title=Israel's gay propaganda war |work=The Guardian |date=July 1, 2010 |first=Jasbir|last=Puar |access-date=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Massad]], associate professor of modern Arab politics and intellectual history at [[Columbia University]], has written that the Israeli government "insist[s] on advertising and exaggerating its recent record on LGBT rights ... to fend off international condemnation of its violations of the rights of the Palestinian people."&lt;ref name=kaufman&gt;{{cite news |last=Kaufman|first=David|title=Is Israel Using Gay Rights to Excuse Its Policy on Palestine?|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2070415,00.html|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=May 13, 2011|access-date=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Morten |last=Berthelsen |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/stop-using-palestinian-gays-to-whitewash-israel-s-image-1.6887 |title='Stop using Palestinian gays to whitewash Israel's image' |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=October 1, 2009 |access-date=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israeli response===
According to some in Israel, pinkwashing allegations against Israel constitute a [[straw man]] argument, and Israel's embrace of the LGBT community has never been used to justify or excuse the Israeli [[occupation of Palestine]]. To them, the fact that Israel is generally tolerant towards LGBT individuals and groups on both state and individual levels is a factual contrast to the discriminatory and often-brutal treatment given to LGBT people by Arab and Muslim groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/the-fallacy-of-the-pinkwashing-argument-1.422951|title=The Fallacy of the 'Pinkwashing' Argument|last=Kirchick|first=James|date=2012-04-06|newspaper=Haaretz|language=en|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mazzig |first=Hen |author-link=Hen Mazzig |date=June 11, 2017 |title=The Dark Side of The Rainbow |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/The-dark-side-of-the-rainbow-496560 |work=The Jerusalem Post }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ido Aharoni]], former head of the [[Brand Israel]] project, responded to such criticism saying: "We are not trying to hide the conflict but broaden the conversation.

[[Yair Qedar]], a gay Israeli filmmaker and civil rights activist, has said that Israel has a praiseworthy LGBT+ rights record and that failing to defend it "ultimately serves homophobia far more than dialogue and peace". He criticized Israeli LGBT+ groups for failing to oppose pinkwashing charges.&lt;ref name=kaufman/&gt; Shaul Ganon of the Israeli based LGBT+ rights group [[Israeli Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Association|Aguda]], assessed the dispute this way: "Each side is trying to gain some points. The truth is the only one who gets screwed by this is the [[LGBT rights in the State of Palestine|Palestinian gays]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Luongo |first1=Michael |title=Gay Palestinians caught in the middle of the conflict |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/middle-east/israel-and-palestine/120607/gay-palestinians-lgbt-israel-conflict |date=June 8, 2012 |newspaper=[[Global Post]] |access-date=January 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anti-pinkwashing ==
Anti-pinkwashing refers to the response that LGBT organizations have had to pinkwashing. Lynn Darwich and Hannen Maikay in their article, "The Road from Antipinkwashing Activism to the Decolonization of Palestine”, is about how the act of pinkwashing by Israel has led to an intersection of queer rights movements and Palestinian rights movements in Palestine and other countries. This is a strategy that has allowed the two activist groups to fight for one cause, however it also places limits on both movements. Darwich and Maikay suggest that the antipinkwashing movement has to consider not only pinkwashing, but also homonationalism, colonialism, and imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Darwich|first1=Lynn|last2=Maikey|first2=Haneen|date=2014|title=The Road from Antipinkwashing Activism to the Decolonization of Palestine|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24365011|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|volume=42|issue=3/4|pages=281–285|jstor=24365011|issn=0732-1562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Country comparisons ==
Stephan Lefebvre of the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]] has noted how the Obama administration, followed by the mainstream US media, has criticized Russia for its failure to provide basic civil liberties for its LGBT population. He contrasts that with the US government's failure to condemn the comparable record on LGBT issues on the part of US allies like Honduras, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as the US government's failure to acknowledge progress on LGBT rights in Cuba. In his analysis, this constitutes pinkwashing, which he defines as "deliberately highlighting support for gay rights while ignoring or downplaying other relevant human rights issues".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lefebvre |first1=Stephan |title=Foreign Policy Pinkwashing: Russia's New Law and Continuing Violence in Honduras|url=http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/the-americas-blog/foreign-policy-pinkwashing-russias-new-law-and-continuing-violence-in-honduras|publisher=[[Center for Economic and Policy Research]]|date=August 16, 2013|access-date=January 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laurie Penny]], an author and feminist activist, contrasted those who criticized Russia's LGBT policies during the [[2014 Winter Olympics|Sochi Olympics]] with their silence on instances of homophobic treatment at their own countries' border crossings.
