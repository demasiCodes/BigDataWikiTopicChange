==Origin of the term==
In April 2010, Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism (QUIT) in the Bay Area, used the phrase ''pinkwashing'' as a twist on ''[[greenwashing]]'', a practice where companies claim to be eco-friendly in order to make profit. Dunya Alwan was at a talk with Ali Abunimah, editor of [[Electronic Intifada]] in 2010, when he said "We won't put up with Israel whitewashing or greenwashing" and she thought "or pinkwashing!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last1=Ellison |first1=Joy |title=Recycled rhetoric: brand Israel 'pinkwashing' in historical context |url=https://via.library.depaul.edu/etd/149 |type=MA thesis |publisher=DePaul University |access-date=31 August 2022 |page=8 |date=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Sarah Schulman]] used the term ''pinkwashing'' in a widely read ''[[The New York Times]]'' editorial arguing that Israel used the tactic in its public relations. Schulman saw pinkwashing as a manifestation of [[homonationalism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tziallas |first1=Evangelos |title=The new 'Porn Wars': representing gay male sexuality in the Middle East |journal=Psychology &amp; Sexuality |date=2015 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=93–110 |doi=10.1080/19419899.2014.983741|s2cid=145381763 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ritchie |first1=Jason |title=Pinkwashing, Homonationalism, and Israel-Palestine: The Conceits of Queer Theory and the Politics of the Ordinary: Pinkwashing, Homonationalism, and Israel-Palestine |journal=Antipode |date=2015 |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=616–634 |doi=10.1111/anti.12100|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; the processes by which some powers selectively agree with the claims of [[sexual minorities]] and exploit them to justify [[racism]], [[xenophobia]] (rejection of foreign people), and [[aporophobia]] (rejection of the poor);&lt;ref name="homonationalism"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Puar |first=Jasbir K. |year=2007 |title=Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in Queer Times |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S-DlmHrJE6AC |publisher=Duke University Press |pages=83 |isbn=978-0-8223-4094-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heteronationalism"&gt;[http://www.publicseminar.org/2016/08/homonationalism-heteronationalism-and-lgbti-rights-in-the-eu/ Homonationalism, Heteronationalism and LGBTI Rights in the EU.] Public Seminar. 31 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Puar |first1=Jasbir |last2=Mikdashi |first2=Maya |date=9 August 2012 |title=Pinkwatching And Pinkwashing: Interpenetration and its Discontents |url=https://www.jadaliyya.com/Details/26818 |access-date=2022-01-20 |website=Jadaliyya - جدلية}}&lt;/ref&gt; in short, the intersection between gay identities and nationalist ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Nichols |first=James Michael |date=2016-10-05 |title=Understanding Homonationalism: Why Are There Gay People Supporting Trump? |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gay-people-supporting-trump-homonationalism_n_57f3e545e4b01b16aaff4bff |access-date=2020-11-18 |website=HuffPost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homonationalism shaped the concept of pinkwashing and the two terms are often used together as tools to explain the actions of countries.

==By country or region==

=== Canada ===
In 2012, [[Jason Kenney]], Canada's Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, was accused of pinkwashing, after an email titled "LGBT Refugees from Iran" was sent to thousands of Canadians. The message contained additional recent comments by [[John Baird (Canadian politician)|John Baird]], Minister of Foreign Affairs, about Canada's stand against the persecution and marginalization of gays and lesbian women around the world. A group of activists claimed that it "is a poor attempt at 'pinkwashing' the Conservative government's obvious desire to encourage war with Iran".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=25 September 2012 |title=Critics accuse Kenney of 'pinkwashing' in targeted emails |work=CTVNews |url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/critics-accuse-kenney-of-pinkwashing-in-targeted-emails-1.970259 |access-date=3 December 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
A coalition organized by several popular grassroots movements in Europe, including the [[English Defence League]] (EDL), mounted [[counter-jihad]] demonstrations in conjunction with LGBT Pride Week celebrations in Helsinki and Stockholm in July and August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In the Tracks of Breivik: Far Right Networks in Northern and Eastern Europe |date=2014 |publisher=LIT Verlag |editor1-last=Deland |editor1-first=Mats |page=12 |editor2-last=Minkenberg |editor2-first=Michael |editor3-last=Mays |editor3-first=Christin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sverigesradio"&gt;{{cite news |date=August 3, 2012 |title=Queers against Pinkwashing reject Counter Jihad |publisher=Radio Sweden |url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=5217586 |access-date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these movements inspired a counter demonstration by an LGBT rights group called "Queers against Pinkwashing", which claimed that the counter-jihad march against [[Muslim]]s was a clear example of pinkwashing and projected a fake support image for sexual minorities.&lt;ref name="sverigesradio" /&gt; In an interview for Radio Sweden, [[Lisa Bjurwald]], a Swedish journalist and expert on European [[right-wing]] ideology, criticized the EDL for allying with the wrong people, as "Queers against Pinkwashing" are in fact against singling out Islam as if it were the source of all the relevant problems because such attempts do not benefit the LGBTQ community.&lt;ref name="sverigesradio" /&gt;

==== Belgium ====
The Flemish nationalist party [[Vlaams Belang]] and [[Filip Dewinter]] shifted their stance on gay issues in the 2010s and began using pro-gay rhetoric to criticize Muslims and immigrants. According to Eric Louis Russell, Dewinter exploits homophobic violence in a similar way that pornography commodifies women's bodies; he argues "that this type of commodification of potential or real violence directed toward members of a society for political ends is a real, albeit [[wikt:subjacent|subjacent]] and deeply insidious form of homophobia".{{sfn|Russell|2019|pp=182, 256}}

==== France ====
[[Marine Le Pen]], president of the French [[far-right]] political party [[National Rally|National Front]], was gaining support from LGBT communities in the presidential election, despite the fact that [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]], her father and the founder of the party, once condemned homosexuality as "a biological and social anomaly".&lt;ref name="french1"&gt;{{Cite web |date=2017-04-07 |title='Pinkwashing' populism: Gay voters embrace French far-right |url=https://apnews.com/article/35ec96903d9444e9942396505d635981 |accessdate=2021-09-13 |website=APNews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Orlando nightclub shooting]], Marine Le Pen declared "how much homosexuality is attacked in countries that live under the Islamist jackboot".&lt;ref name="french1" /&gt; Facing these threats and receiving "sympathy" from Le Pen, some LGBT voters started to advocate for the far-right party, with one supporter stating that "they'll be the first victims of these barbarians, and only Marine is proposing radical solutions".&lt;ref name="french1" /&gt;

=== Ireland ===
According to Professor of Gender and Women's Studies Eithne Luibhéid, Ireland used its [[Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|2015 same-sex marriage referendum]] "to pinkwash its migration regimes, thereby naturalizing harsh policies that reproduce gendered, sexual, racial, economic, and geopolitical inequalities".{{sfn|Luibhéid|2018|p=405}}

===Israel===
The Israeli government's marketing strategy includes "Israel Beyond the Conflict", an attempt to promote aspects of Israeli life outside the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. According to Israeli gay rights activist [[Hagai El-Ad]], "In no other arena has that been used in a more cynical way than in the context of LGBT rights."{{sfn|Atshan|2020|p=80}} According to Palestinian anthropologist [[Sa'ed Atshan]],
{{blockquote|[Israeli] pinkwashing relies on a logic based on four pillars: 
#naming queer Israeli agency and eliding Israeli homophobia; 
#naming Palestinian homophobia and eliding queer Palestinian agency; 
#juxtaposing these contrasting queer experiences in Israeli and Palestinian societies as a civilizational discourse aimed at highlighting the superior humanity of the former and the subhumanity of the latter, who deserve to be dominated; and 
#representing Israel as a gay haven for Israelis, Palestinians, and internationals in order to attract tourism and other forms of solidarity and support.{{sfn|Atshan|2020|p=72}}}}

Opponents of the term pinkwashing in relation to Israel argue that Israeli society has seen [[LGBT rights in Israel|meaningful progress on LGBT rights]] that are better than those in neighbouring countries.{{sfn|Atshan|2020|p=92}} Others highlight the phenomenon of some gay Palestinians who live illegally in Israel;{{sfn|Atshan|2020|pp=99–100}} however, Israel has a rule against granting asylum to such individuals on the basis that "there is no systematic persecution based on sexual orientation in the Palestinian Authority".{{sfn|Atshan|2020|pp=101–102}} Pro-Israel writers also argue that the term is not always applied to other countries that use similar strategies.{{sfn|Atshan|2020|p=95–97}} [[Ido Aharoni]], former head of the [[Brand Israel]] project, responded to such criticism, saying: "We are not trying to hide the conflict, but broaden the conversation."&lt;ref name="kaufman" /&gt; [[Yair Qedar]], a gay Israeli filmmaker and civil rights activist, has said that Israel has a praiseworthy LGBT+ rights record, and that failing to defend it "ultimately serves homophobia far more than dialogue and peace". He criticized Israeli LGBT+ groups for failing to oppose pinkwashing charges.&lt;ref name="kaufman" /&gt; Shaul Ganon of the Israeli-based LGBT+ rights group [[Israeli Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Association|Aguda]], assessed the dispute this way: "Each side is trying to gain some points. The truth is the only one who gets screwed by this is the [[LGBT rights in the State of Palestine|Palestinian gays]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Luongo |first1=Michael |title=Gay Palestinians caught in the middle of the conflict |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/middle-east/israel-and-palestine/120607/gay-palestinians-lgbt-israel-conflict |date=June 8, 2012 |newspaper=[[Global Post]] |access-date=January 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Atshan, "the critiques leveled against [anti-pinkwashing activists] are often not well founded or ethically deployed. It is particularly disconcerting when supporters of Israel instead cast Israeli state sources of victimization as saviors of queer Palestinians."{{sfn|Atshan|2020|p=105}} He also argues that anti-pinkwashing can go too far when activists prioritize the struggle against [[Israeli occupation]] and only bring up LGBT issues in order to criticize Israel.{{sfn|Atshan|2020|p=110}}

After the 2011 [[Gaza Freedom Flotilla]], an Israeli actor created a hoax video in which he pretended to have been turned away from the flotilla because he was gay. The video was promoted by the Israeli prime minister's office.{{sfn|Atshan|2020|pp=79–80}}

[[Joseph Massad]], associate professor of modern Arab politics and intellectual history at [[Columbia University]], has written that the Israeli government "insist[s] on advertising and exaggerating its recent record on LGBT rights ... to fend off international condemnation of its violations of the rights of the Palestinian people".&lt;ref name="kaufman"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kaufman |first=David |title=Is Israel Using Gay Rights to Excuse Its Policy on Palestine? |url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2070415,00.html |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=May 13, 2011 |access-date=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Culture studies academic Nada Elia calls pinkwashing "the twenty-first century manifestation of the Zionist colonialist narrative of bringing civilisation to an otherwise backwards land".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elia |first1=Nada |title=Gay Rights with a Side of Apartheid |journal=Settler Colonial Studies |date=2012 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=49–68 |doi=10.1080/2201473X.2012.10648841|s2cid=154917783|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corporate marketing ==
{{further|LGBT marketing}}
Pinkwashing in the United States, according to author Stephan Dahl from the [[University of Hull]], is centered around pride merchandise created and sold by companies that do nothing for queer people.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dahl |first=Stephan |title=The rise of pride marketing and the curse of 'pink washing' |url=http://theconversation.com/the-rise-of-pride-marketing-and-the-curse-of-pink-washing-30925 |access-date=November 12, 2020 |website=The Conversation}}&lt;/ref&gt; This feeds a "big business small community" relationship and seems beneficial when in reality there is nothing changing legally for queer people through this practice.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A campaign to develop public support for the [[Keystone Pipeline]], which would transport Canadian oil through the United States, has been accused of pinkwashing for its argument that the project deserves support based on a comparison of Canada's record on LGBT rights compared to that of other oil-producing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Michaelson |first1=Jay |title=How Canadian Oilmen Pinkwash the Keystone Pipeline |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/28/how-canadian-oilmen-pinkwash-the-keystone-pipeline.html |publisher=The Daily Beast |date=December 28, 2014 |access-date=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, concern has been raised about the commodification of gay rights by major corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/pink-washing-marketing-stunt-or-corporate-revolution-20150605-ghhthh.html |title="Pink washing": marketing stunt or corporate revolution? |last=Stark |first=Jill |date=June 7, 2015 |accessdate=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[LGBTQ Nation]] states that "many brands that engage in pinkwashing are guilty of using the LGBTQ community to boost their PR and incur capital from 'pink money', all while maintaining unjust labor practices, discriminatory hiring processes, and supporting anti-LGBTQ organizations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=What is pinkwashing? |url=https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/07/what-is-pinkwashing/ |work=[[LGBTQ Nation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intersex movement ==
{{main|Intersex and LGBT}}

In June 2016, [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] pointed to contradictory statements by Australian governments, suggesting that the dignity and rights of LGBT and intersex people are recognized while, at the same time, harmful practices on intersex children continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Submission: list of issues for Australia's Convention Against Torture review | url = https://ihra.org.au/30546/loi-cat-review/ | work = [[Intersex Human Rights Australia]] | date = June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, [[Zwischengeschlecht]] described actions to promote equality or civil status legislation without action on banning "intersex genital mutilations" as a form of pinkwashing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=seelenlos | title = 'Intersex legislation' that allows the daily mutilations to continue = PINKWASHING of IGM practices | url = http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/Intersex-politics-that-ignore-the-daily-mutilations-PINKWASHING-OF-IGM-PRACTICES | work = [[Zwischengeschlecht]] | date = August 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has previously highlighted evasive government statements to UN Treaty Bodies that conflate intersex, transgender and LGBT issues, instead of addressing harmful practices on infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = TRANSCRIPTION &gt; UK Questioned over Intersex Genital Mutilations by UN Committee on the Rights of the Child - Gov Non-Answer + Denial | url = http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/UK-Questioned-over-Intersex-Genital-Mutilations-by-UN-Committee-on-the-Rights-of-the-Child | work = [[Zwischengeschlecht]] | date = May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-pinkwashing==
Anti-pinkwashing or pinkwatching is the opposition to pinkwashing. Lynn Darwich and Hannen Maikay, in their article "The Road from Antipinkwashing Activism to the Decolonization of Palestine", allege that accusations of pinkwashing against Israel have led to an intersection of queer rights movements and Palestinian rights movements in Palestine and other countries, despite ongoing discrimination and abuse of LGBT individuals within Palestinian controlled territories. This is a strategy that has allowed the two activist groups to fight for one cause; however, it also places limits on both movements. Darwich and Maikay suggest that the anti-pinkwashing movement has to consider not only pinkwashing but also homonationalism, colonialism, and imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Darwich |first1=Lynn |last2=Maikey |first2=Haneen |date=2014 |title=The Road from Antipinkwashing Activism to the Decolonization of Palestine |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24365011 |journal=Women's Studies Quarterly |volume=42 |issue=3/4 |pages=281–285 |jstor=24365011 |issn=0732-1562}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Palestinian queer movement rejects pinkwashing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lahiri |first1=Sukrita |title=Anti-Pinkwashing as Emerging Hope: Queering the Palestinian Liberation Movement in the Context of Institutionalised Neoliberalism |journal=International Journal of Critical Diversity Studies |date=2020 |volume=3 |issue=2 |doi=10.13169/intecritdivestud.3.2.0053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alqaisiya |first1=Walaa |title=Decolonial Queering: The Politics of Being Queer in Palestine |journal=Journal of Palestine Studies |date=2018 |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=29–44 |doi=10.1525/jps.2018.47.3.29|s2cid=158219919 |url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/27262/1/27262.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Cyril Ghosh, the argument against pinkwashing portraying Western countries as bastions of LGBT freedom while demonizing countries that lack LGBT rights protection has merit, but can fall into "Radical Theory Creep" when multiple strands of critique are combined in a way that lacks analytic rigor.{{sfn|Ghosh|2018|p=11}}
