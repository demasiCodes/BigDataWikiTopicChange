'''Pinkwashing''' is a [[portmanteau]] [[compound word]] of the words ''pink'' and ''whitewashing''. In the context of [[LGBT rights]], it is used to describe a variety of marketing and political strategies aimed at promoting a product or an entity through an appeal to [[queer]]-friendliness, primarily by political or social activists. The phrase was originally coined by [[Breast Cancer Action]] to identify companies that claimed to support people with [[breast cancer]] while actually profiting from their illness.

== Immigration ==
In 2013, the [[Human Rights Campaign]] officially endorsed comprehensive immigration reform and committed to helping immigrants as they seek health and safety, asylum or citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IMMIGRATION|url=http://www.hrc.org/topics/immigration}}&lt;/ref&gt; The endorsement came days after an incident where a queer immigrant activist was prevented by HRC from discussing their legal status at a Supreme Court rally, mistreatment for which HRC later issued an apology.&lt;ref name="mistreat"&gt;{{cite web|title=HRC Apologizes for Mistreating Trans and Immigrant Activists at Supreme Court rally|url=http://transitiontransmission.com/post/46904132956/hrc-apologizes-for-mistreating-trans-and-immigrant|date=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Huffington Post]]'' described the HRC's actions as pinkwashing, "making immigration reform look pro-gay to garner LGBT support in order to mask the severe drawbacks of the legislation" – drawbacks such as funding to support enforcement, deportation, and further U.S. militarization.&lt;ref name="hpost"&gt;{{cite news|title=How Pinkwashing Masks the Retrograde Effects of Immigration Reform|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/prerna-lal/pinkwashing-immigration-reform_b_3070788.html|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Jason Kenney]], Canada's Citizenship and Immigration Minister, was accused of pinkwashing after an email titled "LGBT Refugees from Iran" was sent to thousands of Canadians. The message contained additional recent comments by [[John Baird (Canadian politician)|John Baird]], Minister of Foreign Affairs, about Canada's stand against the persecution and marginalization of gays and lesbian and women around the world. A group of activists claimed that it "is a poor attempt at 'pinkwashing' the Conservative government's obvious desire to encourage war with Iran."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Critics accuse Kenney of 'pinkwashing' in targeted emails|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/critics-accuse-kenney-of-pinkwashing-in-targeted-emails-1.970259|publisher=CTV NEWS|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20150515160614/http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/critics-accuse-kenney-of-pinkwashing-in-targeted-emails-1.970259|archivedate=15 May 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah Schulman, a writer and professor at the [[City University of New York]], claimes  Israeli [[Public diplomacy (Israel)|government public relations campaign]] exploits this reality to promote public perception of Israel as  a "modern democracy", a "safe and secured place for investment", and a "tourist destination with the sun and the sand".&lt;ref&gt;Avraham, Eli. (2009), "Marketing and managing nation branding during prolonged crisis: The case of Israel". Vol. 5, 3, pp.202–212.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, the ''Jerusalem Post'' reported the Foreign Ministry was promoting Gay Israel as part of its campaigns to counter the negative stereotypes that many liberal Americans and Europeans have of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Foreign-Ministry-promoting-Gay-Israel |title=Foreign Ministry promoting Gay Israel |work=Jerusalem Post |accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of Israel like [[Jasbir Puar]], an associate professor of Women's and Gender Studies at [[Rutgers University]], cite the Israeli government's comparison of LGBT+ rights in Israel and in the [[occupied Palestinian territories]] as an example of pinkwashing. Citing WorldPride, which Jerusalem hosted in 2006, she wrote: "Within global gay and lesbian organising circuits, to be gay friendly is to be modern, cosmopolitan, developed, first-world, global north, and, most significantly, democratic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/01/israels-gay-propaganda-war |title=Israel's gay propaganda war |work=[[ynetnews.com]] |date=1 July 2010 |first=Jasbir|last=Puar |accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Massad]], associate professor of modern Arab politics and intellectual history at [[Columbia University]], has written that the Israeli government "insist[s] on advertising and exaggerating its recent record on LGBT rights ... to fend off international condemnation of its violations of the rights of the Palestinian people."&lt;ref name=kaufman&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaufman|first=David|title=Is Israel Using Gay Rights to Excuse Its Policy on Palestine?|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2070415,00.html|newspaper=Time magazine|date=May 13, 2011|accessdate=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/stop-using-palestinian-gays-to-whitewash-israel-s-image-1.6887 |title='Stop using Palestinian gays to whitewash Israel's image' |work=[[Haaretz]]  |accessdate=January 26, 2015|date=October 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We want to create a sense of relevance with other communities." &lt;ref name=kaufman/&gt; [[Alan Dershowitz]], a Harvard University law professor and a frequent defender of Israel, has said that the term ''pinkwashing'' is used against Israel by "some radical gay activists" who are [[antisemitic]] "bigots."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alan-dershowitz/the-pinkwashing-campaign-_b_2790669.html |title=The Pinkwashing Campaign Against Israel: Another Conspiracy Theory |work=Huffington Post |accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called the use of the term ''pinkwashing'' in this context as "nothing more than anti-Semitism with a pink face."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dershowitz |first=Alan|url=http://nypost.com/2013/02/25/the-next-hate-fest/|work=New York Post|accessdate=December 29, 2014|title=The Next Hate Fest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trustee Blasts CUNY Anti-Israel 'Homonationalism and Pinkwashing' Conference |url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/06/08/trustee-blasts-cuny-anti-israel-homonationalism-and-pinkwashing-conference/ |publisher=Algemeiner.com/ |accessdate=January 26, 2015|date=June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yair Qedar]], a gay Israeli filmmaker and civil rights activist, has said that Israel has a praiseworthy LGBT+ rights record and that failing to defend it "ultimately serves homophobia far more than dialogue and peace".  He criticized Israeli LGBT+ groups for failing to oppose pinkwashing charges.&lt;ref name=kaufman/&gt; Shaul Ganon of the Israeli based LGBT+ rights group [[Israeli Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Association|Aguda]], assessed the dispute this way: "Each side is trying to gain some points.

== Oil industry ==
A campaign to develop public support for the [[Keystone Pipeline]], which would transport Canadian oil through the United States, has been accused of pinkwashing for its argument that the project deserves support based on a comparison of Canada's record on LGBT rights compared to that of other oil-producing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Michaelson|first1=Jay|title=How Canadian Oilmen Pinkwash the Keystone Pipeline|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/28/how-canadian-oilmen-pinkwash-the-keystone-pipeline.html|accessdate=December 29, 2014|work=Daily Beast|date=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign base at OpecHatesgays.com headlines its presentation: "Compare Canadian Ethical Oil to OPEC conflict oil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Compare Canadian Ethical Oil to OPEC conflict oil.|url=http://opechatesgays.com/|website=OpenHatesGays|accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Country comparisons ==
Stephan Lefebvre of the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]] has noted how the Obama administration, followed by the mainstream U.S. media, has criticized Russia for its failure to provide basic civil liberties for its LGBT population. He contrasts that with the U.S. government's failure to condemn the comparable record on LGBT issues on the part of U.S. allies like Honduras, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates, as well as the U.S. Government's failure to acknowledge progress on LGBT rights in Cuba. In his analysis, this constitutes pinkwashing, which he defines as "deliberately highlighting support for gay rights while ignoring or downplaying other relevant human rights issues".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lefebvre |first1=Stephan |title=Foreign Policy Pinkwashing: Russia's New Law and Continuing Violence in Honduras|url=http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/the-americas-blog/foreign-policy-pinkwashing-russias-new-law-and-continuing-violence-in-honduras|publisher=[[Center for Economic and Policy Research]]|date=16 August 2013|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laurie Penny]], an author and feminist activist, contrasted those who criticized Russia's LGBT policies during the [[2014 Winter Olympics|Sochi Olympics]] with their silence on instances of homophobic treatment at their own countries' border crossings.

{{quote|While western nations flap the rainbow flag defiantly in Russia's face, actual lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are being harassed and abused at their borders when they arrive seeking safety. Supporting the rights of LGBT people worldwide is to be commended, but if that sentiment is more than pinkwashing, it should be backed up by action at home.&lt;ref name=Guardian1/&gt;}}
