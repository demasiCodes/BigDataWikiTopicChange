'''''Latinx''''' is a [[neologism]] in [[American English]] which is used to refer to people of [[Latin American]] cultural or ethnic identity in the [[United States]]. The [[Gender-neutral language|gender-neutral]] {{nowrap|{{angbr|-x}}}} suffix replaces the {{nowrap|{{angbr|-o/-a}}}} ending of [[Latino (demonym)|''Latino'' and ''Latina'']] that are typical of [[grammatical gender in Spanish]]. Its plural is '''''Latinxs''''' or '''''Latinxes'''''. Words used for similar purposes include '''''Latin@''''', '''''[[Latine]]''''', and the simple '''''Latin'''''. Related gender-neutral neologisms include ''[[Xicanx]]'' or ''Chicanx''.

The term was first seen online around 2004.&lt;ref name="BUToday"&gt;{{cite web |last=Yarin |first=Sophie |date=October 7, 2022 |title=If Hispanics Hate the Term 'Latinx', Why is it Still Used? |url=https://www.bu.edu/articles/2022/why-is-latinx-still-used-if-hispanics-hate-the-term/ |access-date=October 4, 2023 |website=BU Today |publisher=Boston University}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been used in [[social media]] by activists, students, and academics who seek to advocate for [[non-binary]] and [[genderqueer]] individuals.&lt;!--cited in body--&gt; Reception of the term among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] has been overwhelmingly negative, and surveys have found that the vast majority prefer other terms such as ''[[Hispanic]]'' and ''Latina/Latino'' to describe themselves with only 2–3% using ''Latinx''.&lt;ref name="McGirt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pew Research" /&gt; A 2023 [[Pew Research Center]] survey found that roughly half of U.S. Latinos were not aware of the term ''Latinx''; of those aware of it, 75% said it should not be used, including 36% who found increased usage to be a bad thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2024-09-29 |title=Awareness of 'Latinx' increases among US Latinos, and 'Latine' emerges as an alternative |url=https://apnews.com/article/us-latino-opinions-survey-latinx-latine-3b787510bca7fbd679010af2493eaeed |access-date=2024-10-02 |website=AP News |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Lopez |first=Luis Noe-Bustamante, Gracie Martinez and Mark Hugo |date=2024-09-12 |title=Latinx Awareness Has Doubled Among U.S. Hispanics Since 2019, but Only 4% Use It |url=https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2024/09/12/latinx-awareness-has-doubled-among-u-s-hispanics-since-2019-but-only-4-percent-use-it/ |access-date=2024-10-02 |website=Pew Research Center |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Origins ===
The first records of the term ''Latinx'' appear in the 21st century,&lt;ref name="Lexico" /&gt; but there is no certainty as to its first occurrence.&lt;ref name="Salinas 2020" /&gt; According to [[Google Trends]], it was first seen online in 2004,&lt;ref name="Brammer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gonzalez"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Gonzalez |first=Irina |date=June 19, 2019 |title=Why Did "Latinx" Get Popular—And What Does It Mean? |url=https://www.oprahmag.com/life/a28056593/latinx-meaning/ |access-date=July 14, 2020 |website=Oprah Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guidebook"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Gamio Cuervo |first=Arlene B. |date=August 2016 |title=Latinx: A Brief Guidebook |url=https://www.academia.edu/29657615 |via=[[Academia.edu]] |publisher=Princeton LGBT Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; and first appeared in academic literature around 2013 "in a Puerto Rican psychological periodical to challenge the gender binaries encoded in the Spanish language."&lt;ref name="Salinas 2020" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/12/08/students-adopt-gender-nonspecific-term-latinx-be-more-inclusive "Latina/o/x"]  Josh Logue, December 8, 2015, Inside Higher Ed &lt;/ref&gt;  Contrarily, it has been claimed that usage of the term "started in online chat rooms and [[listserv]]s in the 1990s" and that its first appearance in academic literature was in the Fall 2004 volume of the journal ''Feministas Unidas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Milian |first=Claudia |date=October 4, 2017 |title=Extremely Latin, XOXO: Notes on LatinX |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0921374017727850 |journal=Cultural Dynamics |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=121–140 |doi=10.1177/0921374017727850|s2cid=148942940 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://people.wku.edu/inma.pertusa/encuentros/FemUn/newsletters/FemUn_Fall2004.pdf "Review of Susana Chávez-Silverman’s ''Killer Crónicas: Urbane Gardens of Earthly Delight''"], Elizabeth Horan,  Fall 2004, p. 25, Feministas
Unidas&lt;/ref&gt;   In the rest of the United States, it was first used in activist and LGBT circles as a way to expand on earlier attempts at gender-inclusive forms of the grammatically masculine Latino, such as ''Latino/a'' and ''Latin@.''&lt;ref name="Gonzalez" /&gt; Between 2004 and 2014, ''Latinx'' did not attain broad usage or attention.&lt;ref name="Brammer" /&gt;

Use of ''x'' to expand language can be traced to the word ''Chicano'', which had an ''x'' added to the front of the word, making it ''Xicano''. Scholars have identified this shift as part of the movement to empower people of Mexican origin in the U.S. and also as a means of emphasizing that the origins of the letter ''X'' and term ''Chicano'' are linked to the Indigenous [[Nahuatl|Nahuatl language]].&lt;ref name="Salinas 2020" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rossini |first=Jon D |date=2018 |title=The Latinx, Indigenous, and the Americas Graduate Class: Geography, Pedagogy, and Power |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/715912/pdf |journal=Theatre Journal |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=443–445 |doi=10.1353/tj.2018.0093 |s2cid=135220164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''x'' has also been added to the end of the term ''Chicano'', making it ''Chicanx''. An example of this occurred at [[Columbia University]] where students changed their student group name from "Chicano Caucus" to "Chicanx Caucus" in December 2014.

Jeffrey Herlihy-Mera writes that in Puerto Rico, the "shift toward x in reference to people has already occurred" in limited academic settings and "for many faculty [in the humanities department at the [[University of Puerto Rico]]] ''hermanx'' and ''niñx'' and their equivalents have been the standard ... for years.

[[Matthew Yglesias]] of ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'', discussing [[Donald Trump]]'s gains among Hispanic voters in the [[2020 United States presidential election]], stated that for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], while other factors played a larger role, the term "is, if nothing else, a symptom of the problem, which is a tendency to privilege academic concepts and linguistic innovations in addressing social justice concerns." He says that "[t]he message of the term{{nbsp}}... is that the entire grammatical system of the Spanish language is problematic, which in any other context progressives would recognize as an alienating and insensitive message."

In 2018, the [[Royal Spanish Academy]] rejected the use of ''-x'' and ''-e'' as gender-neutral alternatives to the collective masculine ''-o'' ending, in a style manual published together with the [[Association of Academies of the Spanish Language|Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española]] (ASALE).&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, Adriana" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cataño" /&gt; Regarding this decision, Darío Villanueva, RAE's director said, "The problem is we're confusing [[Grammatical gender in Spanish|grammar]] with machismo."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://remezcla.com/culture/rae-style-manual/?rfb&amp;jwsource=cl |title=The RAE Has Made Its Decision About Latinx and Latine in Its First Style Manual|date=November 28, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''HuffPost'', some refuse to use the term on the grounds that ''Latinx'' is difficult to pronounce in the Spanish language.&lt;ref name="Ramirez"/&gt;

Linguists Janet M. Fuller and Jennifer Leeman state that some people reject the use of ''Latinx'' to refer to people regardless of gender because they see it as a one-size-fits-all term that erases diversity, preferring to switch between ''-o/-a/-x'' when referring to specific individuals.&lt;ref name="fullerleeman"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fuller |first1=Janet M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jsHeDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Latinx |title=Speaking Spanish in the US: The Sociopolitics of Language |last2=Leeman |first2=Jennifer |date=2020 |publisher=Multilingual Matters |isbn=9781788928304 |chapter=Race, Racialization and Latinx Ethnoracial Identity |access-date=September 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who oppose the term in its entirety have argued that the ''-x'' is artificial, unpronounceable, an imposition of English norms on Spanish, or overly [[fad]]dish.&lt;ref name="fullerleeman" /&gt;

Many non-binary Latinos whose first language is not English have also criticized the term on the basis that it caters more to Latin Americans who are fluent in English and can pronounce the ''-x'' ending easily while ignoring gender neutral alternatives already employed by Latin American activists, such as ''-e'' ([[Latine]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Pellot |first=Emerald |date=October 25, 2019 |title=This Comic Proves That The Great Debate On The Word 'Latinx' Rages On |url=https://wearemitu.com/things-that-matter/heres-why-some-latinx-users-are-switching-to-latine-instead/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210302153137/https://wearemitu.com/things-that-matter/heres-why-some-latinx-users-are-switching-to-latine-instead/ |archive-date=March 2, 2021 |access-date=January 12, 2023 |website=We Are Mitú}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguist [[John McWhorter]] argues that, in contrast to other neologisms such as ''[[African American#Terminology|African American]]'', ''Latinx'' has not become mainstream {{As of|2019|lc=yes}} because the problem of implied gender it aims to solve is more a concern of the [[intelligentsia]] than the "proverbial person on the street"&lt;!--because it is a top-down imposition rather than arising from below (same idea, different words)--&gt;.&lt;ref name="McWhorter"/&gt;

Another argument against ''Latinx'' is that "it erases feminist movements in the 1970s" that fought for use of the word ''Latina'' to represent women, according to George Cadava, Director of the Latina and Latino Studies program at [[Northwestern University]].&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, Adriana"/&gt;

''[[Latine]]'' (plural: ''Latines'') as a gender-neutral term is less prevalent than ''Latinx'' within the U.S.,&lt;ref name="Vidal-Ortiz &amp; Martínez"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vidal-Ortiz |first1=Salvador |last2=Martínez |first2=Juliana |title=Latinx thoughts: Latinidad with an X |journal=Latino Studies |date=2018 |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=384–395 |doi=10.1057/s41276-018-0137-8 |s2cid=149742570 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327404627 |via=ResearchGate |quote=Terms like Latin@, Latine, and LatinU have been deployed—with less traction—to mobilize Latina/o communities}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the opposite is true throughout the Spanish-speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Franco |first=Marina |date=Apr 11, 2024 |title=Latine is the new Latinx |url=https://www.axios.com/2024/04/11/latino-latinx-latine-hispanic-term-explainer |website=[[Axios (website)|Axios]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., "Latine" arose out of [[genderqueer]] speakers' use of the ending {{nowrap|{{angbr|-e}}}};  similar forms include ''amigue'' ('friend') and ''[[Elle (Spanish pronoun)|elle]]'' ([[Singular they|singular ''they'']]).&lt;ref name="Papadopoulos"&gt;{{cite thesis |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6j73t666 |title=Morphological Gender Innovations in Spanish of Genderqueer Speakers |last=Papadopoulos |first=Benjamin |date=2019 |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Argentina, efforts to increase gender neutrality in Spanish have utilized both grammatical genders together, as well as {{nowrap|{{angbr|-@}}}} and {{nowrap|{{angbr|-x}}}} endings. According to ''The New York Times'', the {{nowrap|{{angbr|-e}}}} ending has been more widely adopted because it is easier to pronounce.&lt;ref name="Politi"&gt;{{cite news |last=Politi |first=Daniel |date=April 15, 2020 |title=In Argentina, a Bid to Make Language Gender Neutral Gains Traction |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/world/americas/argentina-gender-language.html |url-access=limited |access-date=November 10, 2020 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
