'''''Latinx''''' is a [[neologism]] in [[American English]] which is used to refer to people of [[Latin American]] cultural or ethnic identity in the United States. The [[Gender-neutral language|gender-neutral]] {{nowrap|{{angbr|-x}}}} suffix replaces the {{nowrap|{{angbr|-o/-a}}}} ending of [[Latino (demonym)|''Latino'' and ''Latina'']] that are typical of [[grammatical gender in Spanish]]. Its plural is '''''Latinxs'''''. Words used for similar purposes include '''''Latin@''''' and '''''Latine'''''. Related gender-neutral neologisms include ''[[Chicanx]]'' and ''[[Xicanx]]''.

The term was first seen online around 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yarin|first=Sophie|date=October 7, 2022|title=If Hispanics Hate the Term 'Latinx', Why is it Still Used? |url=https://www.bu.edu/articles/2022/why-is-latinx-still-used-if-hispanics-hate-the-term/ |access-date=November 10, 2022 |website=BU Today|publisher=Boston University}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been used in [[social media]] by activists, students, and academics who seek to advocate for [[non-binary]] and genderqueer individuals.&lt;!--cited in body--&gt; Surveys of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] have found that the vast majority prefer other terms such as ''[[Hispanic]]'' and ''Latina/Latino'' to describe themselves, and that only 2–3% use ''Latinx''.&lt;ref name=McGirt/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pew Research"/&gt; A 2020 [[Pew Research Center]] survey found that roughly three-quarters of U.S. Latinos were not aware of the term ''Latinx''; of those aware of it, 33% said it should be used to describe their racial or ethnic group, while 65% said it should not.&lt;ref name="Hernandez"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hernandez |first1=Daniel |title=Pew poll finds most Latinos haven't heard of 'Latinx.'

== History ==
=== Origins ===
The first records of the term ''Latinx'' appear in the 21st century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite dictionary |url=http://www.lexico.com/definition/Latinx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191229121745/https://www.lexico.com/definition/latinx |url-status=dead |archive-date=2019-12-29 |title=Latinx |dictionary=[[Lexico]] UK English Dictionary |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no certainty as to its first occurrence.&lt;ref name="Salinas 2020" /&gt; According to [[Google Trends]], it was first seen online in 2004,&lt;ref name="Brammer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gonzalez"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Gonzalez |first=Irina |date=June 19, 2019 |title=Why Did "Latinx" Get Popular—And What Does It Mean? |url=https://www.oprahmag.com/life/a28056593/latinx-meaning/ |access-date=2020-07-14 |website=Oprah Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guidebook"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Gamio Cuervo |first=Arlene B. |date=August 2016 |title=Latinx: A Brief Guidebook |url=https://www.academia.edu/29657615 |via=[[Academia.edu]] |publisher=Princeton LGBT Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; and first appeared in academic literature around 2013 "in a Puerto Rican psychological periodical to challenge the gender binaries encoded in the Spanish language."&lt;ref name="Salinas 2020" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/12/08/students-adopt-gender-nonspecific-term-latinx-be-more-inclusive "Latina/o/x"]  Josh Logue, December 8, 2015, Inside Higher Ed &lt;/ref&gt;  Contrarily, it has been claimed that usage of the term "started in online chat rooms and listservs in the 1990s" and that its first appearance in academic literature was in the Fall 2004 volume of the journal ''Feministas Unidas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Milian |first=Claudia |date=2017-10-04 |title=Extremely Latin, XOXO: Notes on LatinX |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0921374017727850 |journal=Cultural Dynamics |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=121–140 |language=en |doi=10.1177/0921374017727850|s2cid=148942940 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://people.wku.edu/inma.pertusa/encuentros/FemUn/newsletters/FemUn_Fall2004.pdf "Review of Susana Chávez-Silverman’s ''Killer Crónicas: Urbane Gardens of Earthly Delight''"], Elizabeth Horan,  Fall 2004, p. 25, Feministas
Unidas&lt;/ref&gt;   In the U.S. it was first used in activist and LGBT circles as a way to expand on earlier attempts at gender-inclusive forms of the grammatically masculine Latino, such as ''Latino/a'' and ''Latin@.''&lt;ref name="Gonzalez" /&gt; Between 2004 and 2014, ''Latinx'' did not attain broad usage or attention.&lt;ref name="Brammer" /&gt;

Use of ''x'' to expand language can be traced to the word ''Chicano'', which had an ''x'' added to the front of the word, making it ''Xicano''. Scholars have identified this shift as part of the movement to empower people of Mexican origin in the U.S. and also as a means of emphasizing that the origins of the letter ''X'' and term ''Chicano'' are linked to the Indigenous [[Nahuatl|Nahuatl language]].&lt;ref name="Salinas 2020" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rossini |first=Jon D |date=2018 |title=The Latinx, Indigenous, and the Americas Graduate Class: Geography, Pedagogy, and Power |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/715912/pdf |journal=Theatre Journal |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=443–445 |doi=10.1353/tj.2018.0093 |s2cid=135220164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''x'' has also been added to the end of the term ''Chicano'', making it ''Chicanx''. An example of this occurred at [[Columbia University]] where students changed their student group name from "Chicano Caucus" to "Chicanx Caucus". Later Columbia University changed the name of Latino Heritage Month to Latinx Hispanic Heritage Month.&lt;ref name="Salinas 2020" /&gt; Salinas and Lozano (2017) state that the term is influenced by [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Mexican indigenous communities]] that have a [[third gender]] role, such as [[Juchitán de Zaragoza]], [[Oaxaca]] (see also: {{slink|Gender system#Juchitán, Oaxaca, Mexico}}).{{r|Salinas &amp; Lozano}} The term often refers specifically to [[LGBT]] people or to young people. Brian Latimer, a producer at MSNBC who identifies as [[nonbinary]], says that the application of the term "shows a generational divide in the Hispanic community".&lt;ref name="Brammer" /&gt;{{rp|60}} In 2016, a student newspaper described the term as "sweeping across college campuses in the nation with the intent of creating inclusion while inadvertently pitting members of the Latino community into a cultural war".&lt;ref name="Magtoto"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Magtoto |first1=Mica |date=9 March 2016 |title=Latinx: A case for inclusion or segregation? |url=http://www.iowastatedaily.com/news/article_3c9ca0ac-e3e6-11e5-a111-b716c6364db2.html |work=[[Iowa State Daily]] |location=Ames, Iowa |access-date=6 August 2019 |quote=The term Latinx has been sweeping across college campuses in the nation with the intent of creating inclusion while inadvertently pitting members of the Latino community into a cultural war.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received wider use after the 2016 [[Orlando nightclub shooting|Pulse nightclub shooting]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Paz |first=Christian |date=2021-11-23 |title=Another Problem for Latinx |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/11/latinx-future-progressive-congress-latino/620764/ |access-date=2021-12-09 |website=The Atlantic |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public awareness and use ===
{{As of|2018}}, the term ''Latinx'' was used nearly exclusively in the United States.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Manuel Vargas writes that people from Latin America ordinarily would not think of themselves using the term unless they reside in the United States.&lt;ref name=sep&gt;{{harvnb|Vargas|2018}}. "Latinx is a term used exclusively within the United States, or nearly so, such that people from Latin America would not ordinarily think of themselves as Latinxs, unless or until they reside in the United States."&lt;/ref&gt; The term was added to the [[Merriam-Webster]] English dictionary&lt;ref name=mw-2019&gt;{{Cite Merriam-Webster |Latinx |access-date=2019-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2018, as it continued to grow in popularity in the United States,&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, Adriana"/&gt; and to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in 2019.&lt;ref name="Dent"&gt;{{cite web |last=Dent |first=Jonathan |date=March 18, 2019 |title=New Words in the OED: March 2019 |url=https://public.oed.com/blog/new-words-in-the-oed-march-2019/ |work=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffrey Herlihy-Mera writes that in Puerto Rico, the "shift toward x in reference to people has already occurred" in limited academic settings and "for many faculty [in the humanities department at the [[University of Puerto Rico]]] ''hermanx'' and ''niñx'' and their equivalents have been the standard ... for years. It is clear that the inclusive approach to nouns and adjectives is becoming more common, and while it may at some point become the prevailing tendency, presently there is no prescriptive control toward either syntax".&lt;ref name="Herlihy-Mera"&gt;{{cite news |last=Herlihy-Mera |first=Jeffrey |date=May 1, 2018 |title=The Cross-Lingual Interse(x)tionality of 'Latinx' |url=https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/2018/05/01/the-cross-lingual-intersextionality-of-latinx/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190821200657/https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/2018/05/01/the-cross-lingual-intersextionality-of-latinx/ |archive-date=August 21, 2019 |work=The Chronicle of Higher Education |url-access=limited}} Also available at [https://www.academia.edu/40003706 Academia.edu].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In literature and academia ===
''Latinx'' has become commonly used by activists in higher education and the popular media who seek to advocate for individuals on [[Genderqueer|the borderlines of gender identity]].&lt;ref name="Salinas &amp; Lozano"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Salinas |first1=Cristobal |last2=Lozano |first2=Adele |date=2017 |title=Mapping and recontextualizing the evolution of the term ''Latinx'': An environmental scanning in higher education |journal=Journal of Latinos and Education |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=302–315 |doi=10.1080/15348431.2017.1390464 |s2cid=149435457}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herlihy-Mera calls ''Latinx'' "a recognition of the exclusionary nature of our institutions, of the deficiencies in existent linguistic structures, and of language as an agent of social change", saying, "The gesture toward linguistic [[intersectionality]] stems from a suffix endowed with a literal intersection—''x''."{{r|Herlihy-Mera}} Some commentators, such as Ed Morales, a lecturer at [[Columbia University]] and author of the 2018 book ''Latinx: The New Force in American Politics and Culture'', associate the term with the ideas of [[Gloria Anzaldúa]], a Chicana feminist. Morales writes that "refusal to conform to male/female gender binaries" parallels "the refusal to conform to a racial binary".&lt;ref name="Brammer" /&gt;{{rp|61}}

''Latinx'' has been the subject of controversy.{{r|Reyes 2017}} [[Linguistic imperialism]] has been used as a basis of both criticism and support.

In 2018, the [[Royal Spanish Academy]] rejected the use of ''-x'' and ''-e'' as gender-neutral alternatives to the collective masculine ''-o'' ending, in a style manual published together with the [[Association of Academies of the Spanish Language|Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española]] (ASALE).&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, Adriana" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cataño" /&gt; Regarding this decision, Darío Villanueva, RAE's director said, "The problem is we're confusing [[Grammatical gender in Spanish|grammar]] with machismo."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://remezcla.com/culture/rae-style-manual/?rfb&amp;jwsource=cl |title=The RAE Has Made Its Decision About Latinx and Latine in Its First Style Manual|date=November 28, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''HuffPost'', some refuse to use the term on the grounds that ''Latinx'' is difficult to pronounce in the Spanish language.&lt;ref name="Ramirez"/&gt;

Linguists Janet M. Fuller and Jennifer Leeman state that some people reject the use of ''Latinx'' to refer to people regardless of gender because they see it as a one-size-fits-all term that erases diversity, preferring to switch between ''-o/-a/-x'' when referring to specific individuals.&lt;ref name="fullerleeman"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fuller |first1=Janet M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jsHeDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Latinx |title=Speaking Spanish in the US: The Sociopolitics of Language |last2=Leeman |first2=Jennifer |date=2020 |publisher=Multilingual Matters |isbn=978-1-78892-830-4 |language=en |chapter=Race, Racialization and Latinx Ethnoracial Identity |access-date=25 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who oppose the term in its entirety have argued that the ''-x'' is artificial, unpronounceable, an imposition of English norms on Spanish, overly [[fad]]dish.&lt;ref name="fullerleeman" /&gt;

Some non-binary Latinos whose first language is not English have also criticized the term on the basis that it caters more to Latin Americans who are fluent in English and can pronounce the ''-x'' ending easily while ignoring gender neutral alternatives already employed by Latin American activists, such as ''-e.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Pellot |first=Emerald |date=2019-10-25 |title=This Comic Proves That The Great Debate On The Word 'Latinx' Rages On |url=https://wearemitu.com/things-that-matter/heres-why-some-latinx-users-are-switching-to-latine-instead/ |access-date=2020-10-11 |website=we are mitú — business and entertainment, culture and sport, movies and music}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural Strategist Henry Cadena mentions in an article published by Manomagazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://manomagazine.com/latinx-inclusive-canceling-culture/ |title=Is ‘Latinx’ Being Inclusive or Canceling Our Culture?|date=March 16, 2021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that numbers are now showing that the term ''Latinx'' has evolved to be an offensive term and that some even call it a racial slur.

Linguist [[John McWhorter]] argues that, in contrast to other neologisms such as ''[[African American#Terminology|African American]]'' or [[Singular they|singular ''they'']], ''Latinx'' has not become mainstream {{As of|2019|lc=yes}} because the problem of implied gender it aims to solve is more a concern of the [[intelligentsia]] than the "proverbial person on the street"&lt;!--because it is a top-down imposition rather than arising from below (same idea, different words)--&gt;.&lt;ref name="McWhorter"/&gt;

[[Matthew Yglesias]] of ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'', discussing [[Donald Trump]]'s gains among Hispanic voters in the [[2020 United States presidential election]], stated that for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], while other factors played a larger role, the term "is, if nothing else, a symptom of the problem, which is a tendency to privilege academic concepts and linguistic innovations in addressing social justice concerns." He says that "[t]he message of the term{{nbsp}}... is that the entire grammatical system of the Spanish language is problematic, which in any other context progressives would recognize as an alienating and insensitive message." Democratic congressman [[Ruben Gallego]], who represents a heavily working-class Hispanic district in [[Arizona]], advises Democrats not to use the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Yglesias |first1=Matthew |title=Trump's gains with Hispanic voters should prompt some progressive rethinking |url=https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/2020/11/5/21548677/trump-hispanic-vote-latinx |access-date=5 November 2020 |work=Vox |date=November 5, 2020 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the [[Congressional Hispanic Caucus]] are hesitant to use the term until after usage continues to evolve to make it more common, according to California representative [[Raul Ruiz (politician)|Raul Ruiz]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to ''[[HuffPost]]'', "Many opponents of the term have suggested that using an un-gendered noun like Latinx is disrespectful to the Spanish language and some have even called the term 'a blatant form of [[linguistic imperialism]]{{' "}}.&lt;ref name="Ramirez"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ramirez |first1=Tanisha Love |last2=Blay |first2=Zeba |date=July 5, 2016 |title=Why People Are Using The Term 'Latinx' |work=HuffPost |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-people-are-using-the-term-latinx_us_57753328e4b0cc0fa136a159 |access-date=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defending usage of the term against critics arguing linguistic imperialism, Brooklyn College professors María R. Scharrón-del Río and Alan A. Aja argue that the Spanish language itself is a form of linguistic imperialism for [[Latin Americans]].&lt;ref name="Scharrón-del Río"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramirez" /&gt;

Another argument against ''Latinx'' is that "it erases feminist movements in the 1970s" that fought for use of the word ''Latina'' to represent women, according to George Cadava, Director of the Latina and Latino Studies program at [[Northwestern University]].&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, Adriana"/&gt;

Writing for ''Latino Rebels,'' Hector Luis Alamo describes the term as a "bulldozing of Spanish".&lt;ref name="Brammer" /&gt; In a 2015 article published by the outlet as part of a debate on the term, Alamo wrote: "If we dump ''Latino'' for ''Latinx'' because it offends some people, then we should go on dumping words forever since there will always be some people who find some words offensive."&lt;ref name=Alamo-2015&gt;{{cite web |date=December 12, 2015 |author=Alamo, Hector Luis |title=The X-ing of Language: The Case Against 'Latinx' |url=http://www.latinorebels.com/2015/12/12/the-x-ing-of-language-the-case-against-latinix/ |work=Latino Rebels}}&lt;/ref&gt;
