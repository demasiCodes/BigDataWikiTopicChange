{{wiktionary|Latinx}}
'''''Latinx''''' ({{respell|la-teen-ex}}) ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|t|iː|n|ɛ|k|s|,_|l|æ|-}}) is a [[Gender neutrality|gender-neutral]] term sometimes used in lieu of ''[[Latino]]'' or ''Latina'' (referencing [[Latin America]]n cultural or racial identity). The plural is ''Latinxs''. The {{nobr|''-x''}} replaces the standard {{nobr|''-o''}} and {{nobr|''-a''}} endings in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[West Iberian languages|related languages]], which form nouns of the masculine and feminine genders, respectively. The term is a politicized [[neologism]] that has gained traction among advocacy groups [[Intersectionality|intersectionally]] combining the [[identity politics]] of [[Race (human categorization)|race]] and [[gender]]. Other forms such as '''''Latin@''''' and '''''Latine''''' are also used.

== History ==
The term ''Latinx'' emerged from American Spanish in the early 21st century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/latinx|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|website=www.oed.com|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was reportedly first used online in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gamio|first=Arlene|title=Latinx: A Brief Guidebook|url=https://www.academia.edu/29657615/Latinx_A_Brief_Guidebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has gained popularity in social media, and is mostly used by community activists and in higher education settings by students, faculty, staff, and some administrators who seek to advocate for individuals living on [[Genderqueer|the borderlines of gender identity]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salinas|first1=Cristobal|last2=Lozano|first2=Adele|title=Mapping and recontextualizing the evolution of the term Latinx: An environmental scanning in higher education|journal=Journal of Latinos and Education|page=1|date=2017|doi=10.1080/15348431.2017.1390464|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15348431.2017.1390464?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true#.WhQdpN411v4.twitter|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Google Trends]], interest in the term spiked in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=latinx|title=Google Trends|website=Google Trends|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term appears in print, also in 2016, in the context of [[LGBT studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wo_JDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=latinx+term#v=onepage&amp;q=latinx%20term&amp;f=false|title=An Examination of Latinx LGBT Populations Across the United States: Intersections of Race and Sexuality|last=Jr|first=Antonio (Jay) Pastrana|last2=Battle|first2=Juan|last3=Harris|first3=Angelique|date=2016-12-22|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137560742}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 NBC News report noted that it was "difficult to pinpoint" the origins of the term, but found "anecdotal evidence" that the term was in use in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Reyes|first=Raul A.|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/are-you-latinx-usage-grows-word-draws-approval-criticism-n651396|title=Are you Latinx? As Usage Grows, Word Draws Approval, Criticism|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same report stated that usage of the term was "without question on the rise at U.S. colleges". [[Oberlin College]], [[New York University]], [[Central Washington University]], and [[Colorado State University]] are among the academic institutions that have advertised events using the word ''Latinx''.

At [[Princeton University]], a [[student group]] called the Princeton University Latinx Perspective Organization was founded in 2016 to "unify Princeton's diverse Latinx community".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pulatinx.wixsite.com/pulpo|title=Home {{!}} Princeton University Latinx Perspectives Organization|work=Home {{!}} Princeton University Latinx Perspectives Organization|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, several student-run organizations at other institutions have utilized the word in their title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lsp.unc.edu/student-organizations/|title=Student Organizations {{!}} UNC Latina/o Studies Program|website=lsp.unc.edu|access-date=2017-04-23}}

Salinas and Lozano (2017) stated that the term is influenced by Mexican indigenous communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salinas|first1=Cristobal|last2=Lozano|first2=Adele|date=2017|title=Mapping and recontextualizing the evolution of the term Latinx: An environmental scanning in higher education|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15348431.2017.1390464?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true#.WhQdpN411v4.twitter|journal=Journal of Latinos and Education|page=1|doi=10.1080/15348431.2017.1390464|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scharrón-del Río and  Aja (2015) have traced the use of Latinx in authors Beatriz Llenin Figueroa, Jaime Géliga Quiñones,  Yuderkys Espinosa Miñoso and Adriana Gallegos Dextre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinorebels.com/2015/12/05/the-case-for-latinx-why-intersectionality-is-not-a-choice/|title=The Case ''for'' 'Latinx': Why Intersectionality Is Not a Choice|last1=Scharrón-del Río|first1=María R.|last2=Aja|first2=Alan A.|date=2015-12-05|website=Latino Rebels|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also been discussed in publications by Pastrana (2016), Battle (2016) and Valdes (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7HVgDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=latinx+term#v=onepage&amp;q=latinx%20term&amp;f=false|title=Diasporic Blackness: The Life and Times of Arturo Alfonso Schomburg|last=Valdés|first=Vanessa K.|date=2017-03-15|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9781438465159}}

==Reception==
The term ''Latinx'' has been the subject of controversy.  In an article for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Daniel Hernandez wrote "Like many of its awkward predecessors, 'Latinx' does not work. Its experimental 'x' opens too many linguistic floodgates. And why is this kind of label necessary at all?"&lt;ref name=L&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=The case ''against'' 'Latinx'|last=Hernandez|first=Daniel|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-hernandez-the-case-against-latinx-20171217-story.html|date=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article on ''[[HuffPost]]'' stated, "Despite the growing popularity of the term, ''Latinx'' has been faced with criticism. Many opponents of the term have suggested that using an un-gendered [[noun]] like ''Latinx'' is disrespectful to the [[Spanish language]] and some have even called the term "a blatant form of linguistic [[imperialism]]." Some refuse to use the term as "''Latinx'' doesn't roll off the tongue in the Spanish language."&lt;ref name=HP&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-people-are-using-the-term-latinx_us_57753328e4b0cc0fa136a159|title=Why People Are Using The Term 'Latinx'|author1=Ramirez, Tanisha Love|author2=Blay, Zeba|date=2016-07-05|work=[[HuffPost]]|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in defense of the term, Brooklyn College professors María R. Scharrón-del Río and Alan A. Aja argue that the Spanish language itself is a form of linguistic imperialism for [[Latin Americans]].&lt;ref name=HP/&gt;

Hector Luis Alamo wrote in an article for ''Latino Rebels'', "If we dump ''Latino'' for ''Latinx'' because it offends some people, then we should go on dumping words forever since there will always be some people who find some words offensive. No word ever oppressed anybody (except maybe the word ''[[God]]'')."&lt;ref name=LR&gt;{{cite web|date=December 12, 2015|author=Luis Alamo, Hector|title=The X-ing of Language: The Case Against 'Latinx'|url=http://www.latinorebels.com/2015/12/12/the-x-ing-of-language-the-case-against-latinix/|work=Latino Rebels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex Roles 66 (3-4):268-281.&lt;/ref&gt; and asserts, "Less clear in the debate (as it has developed since then) is how the replacement silences and erases long-standing struggles to recognize the significance of gender difference and sexual violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trujillo-Pagán |first=Nicole |url=http://www.latinorebels.com/2018/02/27/no-shock-or-awe-about-acting-latinx/ |title=No Shock or Awe About 'Acting' Latinx |publisher=Latino Rebels |date=2018-02-27 |accessdate=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternatives ==
An alternative term is ''Latin@'' (pronounced ''Latínao'') where the postfixed {{nobr|''-[[@]]''}} is taken to represent a combination of {{nobr|''-a''}} and {{nobr|''-o''}} in a single character. This variant is somewhat older, in use since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/heymigente/what-is-latinx-and-afrolatinx-c05a63b5a3d4|title=What is Latinx and AfroLatinx?|publisher=[[Medium (website)|Medium]]|date=2016-08-18|website=#HeyMiGente|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has received criticism for adhering to a binary view of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinorebels.com/2015/12/05/the-case-for-latinx-why-intersectionality-is-not-a-choice/|title=The Case '''for''' ''Latinx'': Why Intersectionality Is Not a Choice|last=Scharrón-del Río|first=María R. |last2=Aja|first2=Alan A.|date=2015-12-05|website=Latino Rebels|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another, more recent, variant is ''Latine'', where the vowel {{nobr|''-e''}} is taken as a "neutral" alternative to either {{nobr|''-a''}} or {{nobr|''-o''}}. Proponents of ''Latine'' say it sounds more natural and grammatical to native Spanish speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=latin|title=Google Trends|website=Google Trends|access-date=2017-04-23}}
