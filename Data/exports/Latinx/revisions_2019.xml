{{wiktionary|Latinx||Latina}}
'''''Latinx''''' is a [[Gender neutrality|gender-neutral]] [[neologism]], sometimes used instead of ''[[Latino]]'' or ''Latina'' to refer to people of [[Latin American]] cultural or racial identity in the United States. The {{angbr|-x}} suffix replaces the standard {{angbr|-o/-a}} ending of nouns and adjectives, typical of [[grammatical gender in Spanish]]. Its plural is ''Latinxs'' {{pronunciation?}}.

The term was first seen around 2004, predominantly online, among  [[intersectional]] advocacy groups combining the [[identity politics]] of [[Race (human categorization)|race]] and [[gender]]. It slowly gained in usage, and came into popular use around 2014, especially in American universities, where its use has since become widespread.

Reactions to this neologism have been mixed, with the most criticism coming from native Spanish speakers. There tends to be a generational and regional divide among supporters and critics of the term, with more support among young people in the United States, and more criticism among older generations, and from those outside the United States. Similar words used for this purpose include ''[[Chicanx]]'', ''Latin@'' and ''Latine''. A 2019 poll found that 2% of Americans of Latin American descent preferred to use 'Latinx', and 3% of 18-34 year olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Left-wing pollster: 98% of Hispanics reject term ‘Latinx’ |url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/98-of-hispanics-and-latinos-do-not-identify-as-latinx |accessdate=4 November 2019 |work=Washington Examiner |date=2 November 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carrasco |first1=Mario X. |title=The Great Latinx Debate |url=https://thinknowresearch.com/blog/the-great-latinx-debate/ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Group identity ==
''Latinx'' is a [[group identity]] used exclusively in the United States. People in Latin America do not self-identify as Latinxs, unless they move there. The [[social category]] has had different names in the past, including [[Hispanic]], ''Latina/o'', and ''Latin@''. In the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], the social category of Latinxs was analyzed in one of three ways, as ethnoracial, as a cultural ethnic group, or as familial-historical.{{sfn|SEP|2018|loc=[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/latinx#GrouIden 1.1 Group Identity]}}

The ethnoracial approach is contextual, highlighting the analyses that Latinxs come from a variety of different races, and from different parts of Latin America, which span all the standard US racial categories. This is the approach taken by [[Linda Martín Alcoff]]. What Latinx means in a particular ethnoracial context depends on the region one is in and the provenance of the population - from one or another Latin American country or group of countries - Cubans, Mexicans, and so on.  Because of this variability and complexity, Alcoff refers to Latinxs as an ''ethnorace'' as, depending on context, Latinxs function sometimes as an [[ethnic group]], and sometimes as a [[racial group]].{{sfn|SEP|2018|loc=[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/latinx#GrouIden 1.1 Group Identity]}}

== History ==
=== Origins and early usage ===
The term ''Latinx'' emerged from [[Spanish language in the United States|American Spanish]] in the early 21st century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Oxford Dictionaries|Latinx|accessdate=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was reportedly first used online in 2004.&lt;ref name=Guidebook&gt;{{Cite web|last=Gamio Cuervo|first=Arlene B.|date=August 2016|title=Latinx: A Brief Guidebook |url=https://www.academia.edu/29657615 |website=[[Academia.edu]] |publisher=Princeton LGBT Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has gained popularity in social media, and is mostly used by community activists and in higher education settings by students, faculty, staff, and some administrators who seek to advocate for individuals living on [[Genderqueer|the borderlines of gender identity]].&lt;ref name=Salinas&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salinas|first1=Cristobal|last2=Lozano|first2=Adele|title=Mapping and recontextualizing the evolution of the term ''Latinx'': An environmental scanning in higher education|journal=Journal of Latinos and Education|volume=18|issue=4|pages=302–315|date=November 16, 2017|doi=10.1080/15348431.2017.1390464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term emerged in response "to circumstances in which existent language structures fail to articulate value in appropriate ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herlihy-Mera |first=Jeffrey |url=https://www.academia.edu/40003706 |title=The Cross-Lingual Interse(x)tionality of 'Latinx &amp;#124; Jeffrey Herlihy-Mera |publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date= |accessdate=2019-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/2018/05/01/the-cross-lingual-intersextionality-of-latinx/|title=The Cross-Lingual Interse(x)tionality of 'Latinx }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intersectionality ===
==== LGBT ====
Salinas and Lozano (2017) stated that the term is influenced by [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico |Mexican indigenous communities]] that have a [[third gender]] role, such as [[Juchitán de Zaragoza]], [[Oaxaca]] (see also: {{slink|Gender system#Juchitán, Oaxaca, Mexico}}).&lt;ref name=Salinas/&gt; 

==== Generational ====
The term often refers specifically to [[LGBT]] people or to young people. Brian Latimer, a producer at MSNBC who identifies as [[nonbinary]], says that the application of the term "shows a generational divide in the Hispanic community".&lt;ref name=Brammer/&gt;{{rp|60}} One college article said that the term was "has been sweeping across college campuses."&lt;ref name=ISD&gt;{{cite news |last1=Magtoto |first1=Mica |date=9 March 2016 |title=Latinx: A case for inclusion or segregation? |url=http://www.iowastatedaily.com/news/article_3c9ca0ac-e3e6-11e5-a111-b716c6364db2.html |url-status=live |work=[[Iowa State Daily]] |location=[[Ames, Iowa]] |access-date=6 August 2019 |quote=The term Latinx has been sweeping across college campuses in the nation with the intent of creating inclusion while inadvertently pitting members of the Latino community into a cultural war. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public awareness ===
The term ''Latinx'' grew in usage since its origins, and came into popular use in late 2014.&lt;ref name=Guerra/&gt;

Many people became more aware of the term in the month following the [[Orlando nightclub shooting]] of June 2016; Google Trends shows that searches for this term rose greatly in this period.&lt;ref name=Brammer&gt;{{cite magazine |first=John Paul |last=Brammer |title=Generation X: Digging Into the Messy History of 'Latinx' Helped Me Embrace My Complex Identity |magazine=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |date=May 2019 |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=59–61 |url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2019/06/digging-into-the-messy-history-of-latinx-helped-me-embrace-my-complex-identity/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|60}}

A 2016 [[NBC News]] report noted that it was "difficult to pinpoint" the origins of the term, but found that usage was "without question on the rise at U.S. colleges".&lt;ref name=Reyes&gt;{{Cite news|last=Reyes|first=Raul A.|date=September 29, 2016|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/are-you-latinx-usage-grows-word-draws-approval-criticism-n651396|title=Are you Latinx? As Usage Grows, Word Draws Approval, Criticism|work=[[NBC News]]|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar use of 'x' in the term ''[[Mx.]]'' may have been an influence or model for the development of ''Latinx''.&lt;ref name="mw-2017"&gt;{{cite web |title='Latinx' And Gender Inclusivity How do you pronounce this more inclusive word? |author=&lt;!--staff writers; no byline--&gt; |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/word-history-latinx |date=2017 |website=Merriam Webster |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803003427/https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/word-history-latinx |archivedate=2017-08-03 |accessdate=2019-08-02 |quote=A similar use of "x" is in Mx., a gender-neutral title of courtesy that is used in place of gendered titles, such as Mr. and Ms. It has been suggested that the use of "x" in Mx. influenced Latinx.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Princeton University]], a [[student group]] called the Princeton University Latinx Perspective Organization was founded in 2016 to "unify Princeton's diverse Latinx community".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://pulatinx.wixsite.com/pulpo |title=Home |work=Princeton University Latinx Perspectives Organization |access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, several student-run organizations at other institutions have utilized the word in their title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lsp.unc.edu/student-organizations/|title=Student Organizations {{!}} UNC Latina/o Studies Program|website=lsp.unc.edu|access-date=2017-04-23}} {{cite web|url=https://www.stuorg.iastate.edu/site/2105|title=Iowa State University – Student Organizations|website=www.stuorg.iastate.edu|access-date=2017-04-23}} {{cite web|url=https://new.oberlin.edu/office/multicultural-resource-center/student-resources/latinx-resources/latinx-student-organizations|title=Latinx Student Organizations {{!}} Multicultural Resource Center |publisher=[[Oberlin College]]|website=new.oberlin.edu|access-date=2017-04-23|date=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''Latinx'' has been called "a recognition of the exclusionary nature of our institutions, of the deficiencies in existent linguistic structures, and of language as an agent of social change,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/2018/05/01/the-cross-lingual-intersextionality-of-latinx/|title=The Cross-Lingual Interse(x)tionality of 'Latinx }}&lt;/ref&gt; the term has also been the subject of controversy. Supporters say it engenders greater acceptance among [[non-binary gender]] Latinos.  [[Linguistic imperialism]] has been used both as a basis of criticism, and of support. The term has been criticized by some lexicographers and rejected from some dictionaries on [[Grammatical gender in Spanish|grammatical grounds]], and accepted by others.  Some have argued that the term supports [[Patriarchy|patriarchal bias]], is [[antifeminist]], based on [[political correctness]], or criticized it because it is difficult to pronounce. 

=== Criticism ===
The term ''Latinx'' has been criticized for being used almost exclusively in the United States and for being virtually non-existent in Spanish-speaking countries.&lt;ref name=Guerra/&gt; A 2016 ''[[HuffPost]]'' article stated, "Many opponents of the term have suggested that using an un-gendered noun like Latinx is disrespectful to the Spanish language and some have even called the term 'a blatant form of linguistic imperialism.'"&lt;ref name=HuffPo&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-people-are-using-the-term-latinx_us_57753328e4b0cc0fa136a159|title=Why People Are Using The Term 'Latinx'|last1=Ramirez |first1=Tanisha Love|last2=Blay |first2=Zeba|date=July 5, 2016|work=[[HuffPost]]|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guerra&gt;{{cite newspaper |last1=Guerra |first1=Gilbert |last2=Orbea |first2=Gilbert |date=November 19, 2015 |title=The argument against the use of the term 'Latinx' |newspaper=The Phoenix |url=https://swarthmorephoenix.com/2015/11/19/the-argument-against-the-use-of-the-term-latinx/ |accessdate=2019-07-01 |quote=This is a blatant form of linguistic imperialism – the forcing of U.S. ideals upon a language in a way that does not grammatically or orally correspond with it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 article for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Daniel Hernandez wrote "The term is used mostly by an educated minority, largely in the U.S."&lt;ref name=Hernandez&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=The case ''against'' 'Latinx'|last=Hernandez|first=Daniel|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-hernandez-the-case-against-latinx-20171217-story.html|date=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some refuse to use the term, as ''Latinx'' "doesn't roll off the tongue" in the Spanish language.&lt;ref name=HuffPo /&gt;

Another argument against ''Latinx'' is that "it erases feminist movements in the 1970s" that fought for use of the word ''Latina'' to represent women.&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt; 

Hector Luis Alamo described the term as a "bulldozing of Spanish".&lt;ref name=Brammer /&gt; In a 2015 article for ''Latino Rebels'', Alamo wrote: "If we dump ''Latino'' for ''Latinx'' because it offends some people, then we should go on dumping words forever since there will always be some people who find some words offensive.&lt;ref name=Alamo-2015&gt;{{cite web|date=December 12, 2015|author=Luis Alamo, Hector|title=The X-ing of Language: The Case Against 'Latinx' |url=http://www.latinorebels.com/2015/12/12/the-x-ing-of-language-the-case-against-latinix/|work=Latino Rebels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Latinx'' was rejected in 2018 by the [[Royal Spanish Academy]], an authority on the Spanish language.&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cataño |first=Adriana |date=November 28, 2018 |title=The RAE Has Made Its Decision About Latinx and Latine in Its First Style Manual |url=https://remezcla.com/culture/rae-style-manual/ |website=Remezcla |language=en-US |accessdate=2019-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[disability rights]] activists have raised accessibility concerns with ''Latinx'' and its alternative ''Latin@'' because they cannot be pronounced by [[screen reader]]s used by the blind and [[visually impaired]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Berastaín |first1=Pierre |last2=Barillas |first2=Karina |last3=DeLeon |first3=Pierre |title=Should organizations use Latin@ or Latinx? |url=https://enblog.nationallatinonetwork.org/should-organizations-use-latin-or-latinx/ |website=National Latin@ Network Blog |accessdate=2019-06-09 |date=August 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Latinx'' allows those who do not identify within the gender binary to be seen and accepted by getting rid of the gendered ending of ''Latina/o'', said Yara Simón in ''Remezcla''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Simón|first=Yara|url=http://remezcla.com/features/culture/latino-vs-hispanic-vs-latinx-how-these-words-originated/|title=Hispanic vs. Latino vs. Latinx: A Brief History of How These Words Originated|date=September 14, 2018|website=Remezcla|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Spanish and in English, the suffix "x has grown into the linguistic vacuum created by a culture that values inclusivity over the ideologies embedded in a and o."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/2018/05/01/the-cross-lingual-intersextionality-of-latinx/|title=The Cross-Lingual Interse(x)tionality of 'Latinx }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators, such as Ed Morales, a lecturer at [[Columbia University]] and author of the 2018 book ''Latinx: The New Force in American Politics and Culture'', associate the term with the ideas of [[Gloria Anzaldúa]], a Chicana feminist. Morales writes that "refusal to conform to male/female gender binaries" parallels "the refusal to conform to a racial binary".&lt;ref name="Brammer"/&gt;{{rp|61}} Jeffrey Herlihy-Mera argues that "The gesture toward linguistic intersectionality stems from a suffix endowed with a literal intersection — ''x''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/40003706|title=The Cross-Lingual Interse(x)tionality of 'Latinx }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defending usage of the term against critics arguing linguistic imperialism, Brooklyn College professors María R. Scharrón-del Río and Alan A. Aja argued that the Spanish language itself is a form of linguistic imperialism for [[Latin Americans]].&lt;ref name=Case4/&gt;&lt;ref name=HuffPo /&gt;

The term ''Latinx'' was added to the [[Merriam-Webster]] English dictionary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Latinx|accessdate=2019-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2018, as it continued to grow in popularity.&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt;

One such term is ''Latin@'' (pronounced as if spelled {{angbr|Latinao}}), which combines the written form of the {{angbr|-a}} and {{angbr|-o}} endings and has been in use since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/heymigente/what-is-latinx-and-afrolatinx-c05a63b5a3d4|title=What is Latinx and AfroLatinx?|publisher=[[Medium (website)|Medium]]|date=2016-08-18|website=#HeyMiGente|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has received criticism for being unpronounceable&lt;ref name=todes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revistacabal.coop/actualidad/todxs-tods-y-todes-la-revolucion-de-la-lengua|title=Todxs, tod@s y todes: la revolución de la lengua}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for adhering to a binary view of gender.&lt;ref name=Case4/&gt; Another similar word is ''Chicanx,''&lt;ref name="Monforti-2019"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lavariega Monforti |first=Jessica L |title=Latinos in the American Political System: An Encyclopedia of Latinos as Voters, Candidates, and Office Holders &amp;#91;2 volumes&amp;#93; |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mPaKDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA341 |accessdate=4 August 2019 |date=14 March 2019 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, California |page=341 |isbn=978-1-4408-5347-0 |oclc=1044771128 |quote=The Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanx de Aztlán (M.E.Ch.A.) is a student-led organization established in 1969 as part of the larger U.S. Civil Rights Movement.

Another alternative is ''Latine'' (plural: ''Latines''), which arose out of a recent trend among parts of Spanish speakers to use the ending ''-e'' for gender-neutral forms likes ''amigue'' ('friend'), ''todes'' ('all') and ''elle'' (a gender-neutral pronoun comparable to [[singular they|singular ''they'']] in English).&lt;ref name=Gutierrez/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://escholarship.org/content/qt6j73t666/qt6j73t666.pdf?t=pszalz|title=Innovaciones al género morfológico en el español de hablantes genderqueer (Morphological Gender Innovations in Spanish of Genderqueer Speakers)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mykidisgay.com/blog/genero-fluido-cuir-neutro|title=Hablando sobre personas que se identifican con un género otro que el de mujer u hombre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=todes/&gt;{{Better source|reason=none of these sources hold up; see Talk:#Latines.|date=October 2019}} Instead of replacing a/o endings with xs (lxs niñxs), a pronounceable alternative is to replace those endings with es (les niñes). While not as popular as ''Latinx,'' ''Latine'' does address both the concerns of non-binary Latines and their advocates and people trying to preserve Spanish without imposing English standards onto the language.&lt;ref name=Gutierrez&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dailynorthwestern.com/2018/10/16/opinion/gutierrez-the-argument-for-latinx/|title=Gutierrez: The argument for 'Latinx'}}&lt;/ref&gt;
