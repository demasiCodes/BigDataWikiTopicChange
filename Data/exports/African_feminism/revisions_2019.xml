African feminism includes many strains of its own, including Motherism, Femalism, Snail-sense Feminism, Womanism/women palavering, Nego-feminism, Satanism, and African Womanism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nkealah|first=Naomi|title=(West) African Feminisms and Their Challenges|journal=Journal of Literary Studies|volume=32|issue=2|pages=61–74|year=2016|doi=10.1080/02564718.2016.1198156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Africa is not a monolith, these feminisms are not all reflective of the experiences African women have. Some of the feminisms are more specific to certain groups of African women. African feminism is sometimes aligned with, in dialogue, or in conflict with [[Black feminism|Black Feminism]]  or [[Africana womanism|African womanism]] (which is perceived as by and for African women in the diaspora, rather than African women on or recently from the continent) as well as other feminisms and [[Feminist movements and ideologies|feminist movements]], including nationally based ones, such as [[feminism in Sweden]], [[feminism in India]], [[feminism in Mexico]], [[feminism in Japan]], [[feminism in Germany]], [[feminism in South Africa]], and so on.

== Need for an African feminism ==
Some argue that African women are the first feminists,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baderoon|first=Gabeba|last2=Decker|first2=Alicia C.|date=2018-11-01|title=African FeminismsCartographies for the Twenty-First Century|journal=Meridians|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=219–231|doi=10.1215/15366936-7176384|issn=1536-6936}}&lt;/ref&gt; were already deeply engaged at the 1985 Women's' Conference,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swaim-Fox|first=Callan|date=2018-11-01|title=Decade for Women Information Resources #5Images of Nairobi, Reflections and Follow-Up, International Women's Tribune Center|journal=Meridians|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=296–308|doi=10.1215/15366936-7176450|issn=1536-6936}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have long been recognizing each other's contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Busia|first=Abena P.

White Western feminisms does not take into account the particular issues black women face at the intersection of both their blackness and their womanhood. Currently, white feminism often classifies African women as "women of color," which groups and thereby represses the African woman's historical trajectory and specific experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Hazel Carby]] in "White Women Listen! Black Feminism and the Boundaries of Sisterhood" notes why white feminism is considered the normative experience of all women. She writes, "History has constructed our sexuality and our femininity as deviating from those qualities with which white women, as the prize of the Western world, have been endowed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ceev2zRrKBgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=black+feminism+and+white+feminism&amp;ots=kzdzOfjHyV&amp;sig=w_ervK66BDRzd5Qn4x7vxqT3zzg#v=onepage&amp;q=black%20feminism%20and%20white%20feminism&amp;f=false|chapter=White Women Listen!

African feminism was not wholly a reaction to being excluded from white feminists' vision of feminism, but also from their own ingenuity and desire to create a feminism that embraced their backgrounds and experiences. African feminism voices the realities of women in varying African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://agi.ac.za/sites/agi.ac.za/files/features_-_african_feminism_in_the_21st_century-_a_reflection_on_ugandagcos_victories_battles_and_reversals.pdf|title=African feminism in context: Reflections on the legitimation battles, victories and reversals|last=Ahikire|first=Josephine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160802051528/http://agi.ac.za/sites/agi.ac.za/files/features_-_african_feminism_in_the_21st_century-_a_reflection_on_ugandagcos_victories_battles_and_reversals.pdf|archive-date=2016-08-02|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's needs, reality, oppression and empowerment are best addressed by having an inclusive and accommodating understanding of the generic and more general issues as well as the peculiarities and group attitude to self-definition as women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Naomi Nkealah]] writes that African feminism "strives to create a new, liberal, productive and self-reliant African woman within the heterogeneous cultures of Africa. Feminisms in Africa, ultimately, aim at modifying culture as it affects women in different societies."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

At the same time, Africa is not a monolith and so some have critiqued any idea of "African feminism." There exist differences regionally, ethnically, politically, and in religion, which all work to impact how women conceptualize what feminism and freedom looks like for them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pereira|first=Charmaine|date=2018-11-01|title=Beyond the SpectacularContextualizing Gender Relations in the Wake of the Boko Haram Insurgency|journal=Meridians|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=246–268|doi=10.1215/15366936-7176417|issn=1536-6936}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ouguir|first=Aziza|last2=Sadiqi|first2=Fatima|date=2018-11-01|title=Reflecting on Feminisms in AfricaA Conversation from Morocco|journal=Meridians|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=269–278|doi=10.1215/15366936-7176428|issn=1536-6936}}&lt;/ref&gt; While African women from, for example, Egypt, Kenya, South Africa and Senegal will have some commonalities, there will be variations in the way they understand gender and gender struggles.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, these varying cultures alter the way these African women experience the world. Thus, one cannot simply merge all woman under an unrealistic expectation of sisterhood, but instead to recognize and respect the differences that exist as a result of these diversities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There is a commonality to the struggles women face across the world since the common factor is male privilege.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The modern African woman is strong, smart, and resilient and has woken up to the options she has. She is no longer satisfied with the options created for her, but seeks to create new options and choices for the generation of other African women that will come after her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://urbanwomanmag.com/what-is-african-feminism/|title=What is African Feminism? |first=Amaka |last=Orakwue|date=19 March 2018|work=Urban Woman Magazine|access-date=21 March 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles of African feminism ==
African feminisms address cultural issues that they feel pertain to the complex experiences faced by all women of all cultures on the African continent. In regards to feminist theorizing, many of the authors of such theories originate from West Africa and Nigeria in particular.&lt;sup&gt;[[African feminism#cite note-:0-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

In her article, "West African Feminisms and Their Challenges", Naomi Nkealah discusses the various forms of African feminisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1080/02564718.2016.1198156|title = (West) African Feminisms and Their Challenges|journal = Journal of Literary Studies|volume = 32|issue = 2|pages = 61–74|year = 2016|last1 = Nkealah|first1 = Naomi}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, she points to [[womanism]], which she argues is not part of African feminism, as it pertains to African women of the diaspora and not continental African women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Second, she looks at [[stiwanism]], which, on the contrary, places African women at the center of the discourse because stiwanism is deeply rooted in the experiences and realities African women face.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Third, she looks at [[Motherism]], a maternal form of feminism that sees rural women as performing the necessary task of nurturing society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fourth, she looks at [[femalism]], which puts the woman's body at the center of feminist conversations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Finally, she looks at [[nego-feminism]] and [[snail-sense feminism]], which urge the inclusion of men in discussions and advocacy for feminism and both argue that the inclusion of men is necessary to the freedom of women.

These modes of feminisms share several commonalities. First, they all challenge the term "feminism," both its Western term and roots, because they bring to the forefront the experiences of the African woman.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Second, because they are dependent on indigenous blueprints, they take from the histories and cultures of African peoples in order to create the necessary tools needed to embolden women and educate men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Third, they incorporate "gender inclusion, collaboration and accommodation to ensure that both women and men contribute (even if not equally) to improving the material conditions of women."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The variety in feminisms displays the African woman's active engagement with gender relations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Examples of African feminism ==

=== Feminism in Nigeria ===
Although noteworthy feminist movements have sprouted across the African continent, the feminist movement in Nigeria serves as a prime example of African feminism. Following the 1982 national conference, the inauguration of the organization Women in Nigeria (WIN) presented feminism in its present form - consistent, organized, with clear objectives and ideology.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Citation|last=Madunagu|first=Bene E.|chapter=The Nigerian Feminist Movement: Lessons from Women in Nigeria (WIN)|date=2010|pages=155–165|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=9781349290345|doi=10.1057/9780230114326_11|title=African Women}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of rough beginnings, many scholars pay tribute to WIN for acting as training grounds for the emergence of organized feminist struggles in Nigeria.
[[File:Art+Feminism Editathon 2019 held by Wikimedia Nigeria Foundation with CEEHOPE in Nigeria in the month of March 2019 05.jpg|thumb|300x300px]]
During its first ten years, WIN facilitated the development of many of the self-identified feminists in Nigeria today.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; WIN adopted an open membership policy of ‘come one - come all’, where anyone, male or female, was accepted as long as such a person accepted the provisions of WIN's Constitution.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; WIN's open membership policy allowed the entry of many persons who had no clue about the core values of feminism and principles of gender justice.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

From its inception, Women in Nigeria sponsored research projects while engaging in policy advocacy and activism that holistically aimed towards enhancing the socioeconomic conditions under which many women in Nigeria experienced.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Furthermore, the uniqueness of WIN derives from its consciousness of both class and gender in relation to the struggle for the emancipation of Nigerian women.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Therefore, WIN recognized the Nigerian female experience as essentially as “double jeopardy,” where exploitation and oppression of women marked as dual forms of injustices, both as members of the subordinate class and as women.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

====== WIN to NFF ======
In January 2008, the Nigerian feminist movement inaugurated the Nigerian Feminist Forum (NFF) - which established a larger and more coherent coalition than WIN. In the early 2000s, the NFF was created after an incubation period that started with the launching of the [[African Feminist Forum]] (AFF) in Accra, Ghana. The AFF published the ''[[Charter of Feminist Principles for African Feminists|Charter of the Feminist Principles]]'' which serves as an informative guide for African Feminists that clearly states how African feminists define themselves, it delivers the understanding of Feminism and Patriarchy, and amplifies the identity, ethics and proper knowledge of feminist leadership across the continent of Africa.

After much success at the grassroots level, the NFF effectively expanded and replaced Women in Nigeria (WIN) as the official Nigerian Feminist Movement. Furthermore, these newly evolved Nigerian feminist movements took part of the continental (Pan African) feminist movement, where thousands of feminist activists from all over the region were brought together to fight against the Patriarchy.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

'''Challenges'''

The socio-economic impacts of inequity and injustice towards African feminist movements serve as detrimental stressors that inhibit women's rights, which tampers with their overall political movement. Overall, most women are unemployed, where in most cases even if they are employed, women are often employed as casuals, or temps.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=My Dream is to be Bold: Our Work to End Patriarchy|publisher=Pambazuka Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=Cape Town, South Africa|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ultimately hampers women's ability to organize, mobilize and collectively advocate.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Another difficulty is how strong the patriarchy is in both urban and rural African communities.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This influences domestic politics within the household and ultimately in every community, which sways women to act against their own beliefs and against other women as well.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

'''South Sudanese Feminism'''

'''Background History of Sudanese Feminism''' 
In Sudan, religion is an integral part of how the lives of women are governed (Halim 389). Since most of the population in Sudan follows the Islamic faith, they adhere to Sharia, the religious law enforced through the lens of the Quran (Hale 90). The Sharia law was implemented by President Gaafar Mohamed Nimeiry as a way to gain support in a time of instability (Halim 392). It creates rules for the Sudanese people that would silence the unrest, especially concerning the control over women's conduct. Although this regime was ended by a brief democracy, it did nothing to combat the Sharia laws (Halim 390). Many regimes have stated the equality of sexes in their constitutions, still, women's rights are targets during times of instability (Halim 390).

'''Sudanese Feminist Groups'''

Sudanese Women's Union (SWU)
	The Sudanese Women's Union (SWU) was one of the most influential organizations during the 1940s when Sudan was under Anglo-European rule (Halim 391). The creation of the SWU occurred simultaneously with the national movement, both combined their efforts to separate from Anglo-Egyptian rule (Halim 391). The founders of the SWU, Al Amin and Ahmed Abdel Mageid explained that due to prejudices about women's participation in public activities, they were not allowed to join the Graduates congress (Halim 391). The union was seen as a social organization that was concerned with women in the domestic sphere (Halim 391). Progress was made through a restricted right to vote under the pretense, the women were educated. They also created a magazine called the “Women’s Voice” which was a political outlet encouragement of democracy and women's rights (Halim 392). Still, women part of the SWU denied any involvement with The Sudanese Communist party, regardless of their political activity (Halim 392). The SCP was the first to allow women to join, attracting educated women (Halim 392). The idea of political membership is what divided the SWU, and created the Patriotic women's front (Halim 392). The SWU women were left very susceptible to imprisonment and harassment because of their involvement in politics (Badri 9). The Nimeri regime, even covered up the SWU's effort by putting out their successes like first woman minister and woman judges. Then he implemented the September laws that made women inferior to men. In the late 1980s, women's feminist movement was at a halt due to the military government, still the Women's voice continued to highlight the injustices of the regime (Halim 393).

'''The Republican Sisters'''
	
This women's organization was based on the Republican party of brothers based on the battle against the first military regime in Sudan (Halim 393). They were supported by their male counterparts, and together campaigned for equal rights. The brothers were a huge part of the struggle for equality and supports women during their speeches and distribute their publications (Halim 395). They traveled around cities and held campaigns and debates to question attitudes against women (Halim 394). Their objective was to spread their theories and encourage a new perspective about women's rights. The Republican women faced grave injustices by the security bureau and ultimately ended in the leader's death (Halim 395). Usatdh Mahmoud started the party in 1945 and started to publicize his book The Second Message of Islam, he wrote about the rules of Islam and the implementation of equality of sexes (Halim 393). Ustadh published motivation for women's rights through lectures, discussions, and pushing women to be part of intellectual spaces (Halim 395).

'''Goals of the Sudanese Feminist Groups'''

Women groups were seen as a method of westernizing Muslim life (Halim 395). Women in the Union fought hard for equal pay pension and the accessibility to work (Halim 395). They argued it was the traditions in place that restricted women's rights and wanted to separate religion and traditional practices (Halim 396). The main demands of the SWU were the emancipation of women, higher status through education, night-schools to teach literacy, equal pay, and fighting against traditionalist practices. The Republican Sisters believed equality was a part of religion that was a natural right (Halim 396). They took their goals further and also fought against laws that oppressed women. The women's union work was focused on creating change through politics and Republication strived for legal action (Halim 396).

'''Issues and Feminist Actions in Response:'''

'''Marriage &amp; Divorce'''

Originally, women did not have some control over who got married and it was a contract between the father and husband. This caused many women to be in forced marriages, the Women's union made it aware of people the overwhelming number of suicides caused by this and consent was enforced (Halim 398). Dowry is central to marriage, yet many men could not afford to pay them, so the Women's Union and they campaigned for a lower amount (Halim 399). Their main concern was to make sure women would marry who they wanted to marry without the expensive dowries (Halim 399). They also published less spending, education for girls, and the reinstatement of marriage as a peaceful agreement (Halim 399). Many women were subjected to the dangers of abusive husbands because of the law that women had to be returned by police if disobedient and ran away (Halim 400). The Women's Union made sure that the idea of forcing a return on a women was repealed (Halim 400).
	The Republican Sisters took a different pathway by reshaping the perspective on women about respect and gender roles. They released the book called Focus on Personal Status law, it talked about creating change from Shar’ia laws (Halim 401). They supported a return to simple and inexpensive weddings and a focus on no guardianship in marriage. They also reimplanted the basic right to divorce women and handling divorces outside of court (Halim 402). Last, they campaigned for the deduction of dowry to be put into value as dignity for women (Halim 402).

'''Present Activism'''

'''Protests'''

Currently in Sudan, Sudanese women are uniting to protest against the Sudan government in hopes of achieving justice and equality for women (Sarai). There are large groups of protest that have taken place in the streets of Sudan where women are chanting and holding up signs demanding for a new government. The protesting women are fighting for a 50% representation of women in the government. However, currently the quota rate is 30%, which shows the lack of female representation in the government, resulting in a large toll on the lives of the Sudanese women. Although the Sudanese women are fighting to create change, the protests have brought great danger to the safety of women (Bhalla). The government's response to the protests have been several cases of rape on the protesting women that were committed by security forces (Bhalla). However, there has not been justice done for the cases, which has further driven the Sudanese women to protest and fight for their rights. Even with the dangers the protests bring on the women, the women continue to strive and fight for an equal representation of women in the Sudan government and to achieve equal rights and justice (Bhalla). 
Facebook Groups
In addition to protests, Sudanese women have made private Facebook groups to find police officers who are actively punishing the women in the protests (Griffin). Their goal is to publicly expose the police officers in order for people to find the officer's home and physically attack them. Only women are allowed in the groups, in which they upload pictures of the officers and people can respond with his information so that people can locate him. The Facebook groups have posed such a threat to the officers, that it has made it difficult for them to show their faces in public without covering them (Griffin) . It is evident that the groups have given the Sudanese women a form of power over the government and have become crucial in their attempts to push for women representation in the government. 
Sovereign Council
	In attempts to female representation in Sudan's government, on August 21, 2019, there was a solemn ceremony that took place in Khartoum, Sudan where 11 people were sworn in to lead the country (Solomon). The 11 people sworn in were a part of a group named the sovereign council, in which two of them were women. This is significant in bringing more female representation in the government, which will allow for more rights given to the women and an opportunity for the women to voice their opinions more freely. Raja Nicola Issa Abdul-Masseh, a female member of the sovereign council, states, “We shall try to rebuild our country, we shall try to rebuild our economy, we shall begin to stop all the armed movements and work for peace and justice for all Sudanese on an equal basis regardless of race or religion or any political opinion or any affiliation” (Solomon). The two female members in the sovereign council are striving to bring more equality and justice for women in Sudan.

==== Olufunmilayo Ransome-Kuti (1900 - 1978) ====
[[File:70 year old Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti on her birthday.png|thumb]]
Serving as a teacher, an educationist, and a women's rights activist, [[Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti|Frances Abigail Olufunmilayo Ransome-Kuti]] is widely well known as one of Nigeria's earliest and foremost champions of women's rights during the colonial period. At a time where most girls were not granted access to Western education, Olufunmilayo had the distinction of being the first female student of St. John Primary School, Abeokuta, from 1906 to 1913.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Citation|last=Awe|first=Bolanle|chapter=Writing Women into History: The Nigerian Experience|date=1991|pages=211–220|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=9780333541616|doi=10.1007/978-1-349-21512-6_11|title=Writing Women's History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being one of the first set of girls to attend school in Nigeria, Olufunmilayo was then sent to study abroad in England to finish her higher education at Wincham Hall College in Yorkshire. She studied Music, Education, Domestic Science and French, where in 1923, she returned to Nigeria fully equipped for a teaching career.

Although she participated in numerous domestic improvements in Nigeria, Olufunmilayo manifested remarkable contributions to the African women's movement that credited her the most fame. In 1944, Olufunmilayo, along with a few peers, founded the Abeokuta Ladies Club (ALC), essentially “designed as a social club made up of educated women like her who felt compelled to help other less privileged women.”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In this club, these women would learn some vocational skills, where the ALC would encourage them to read and write. With other feminist organizations gradually merging with the Abeokuta Women's Union (AWU) in 1946, Mrs. Olufunmilayo was chosen as president of a coalition that became a formidable instrument for combating against all forms of discrimination towards African women.

During the colonial era, the Sole Native Authority (SNA), the system of government introduced by the colonial administration in Abeokuta, were the main proponents behind all oppression towards African women. All power resided at the hands of the traditional ruler and local elites. Where women were entirely excluded from Nigerian governance, which meant no female participation in communal affairs or Nigerian politics. Under colonialism, the women of Abeokuta naturally believed that their economic and communal roles were declining, while their taxes were steadily increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Byfield|first=Judith A.|chapter=African Women in Colonial Economies|date=2018|pages=145–170|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=9781137594259|doi=10.1057/978-1-137-59426-6_6|title=The Palgrave Handbook of African Colonial and Postcolonial History}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, Olufunmilayo Ransome-Kuti led a protest against the Sole Native Authority in Abeokuta, where the AWU argued for representation in local government and advocated for the abolition of the separate tax rate for women. As a result, the Egba Interim Council was formed, which included four (4) women representing the four sections of Abeokuta town.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

==== Lady Kofoworola Aina Ademola (1913 - 2002)====
An active volunteer and energetic social worker, [[Kofoworola Ademola|Lady Kofoworola Aina Ademola]] has notably been recognized as a distinguished women's rights activist and remarkable educationist. Coming from a rather privileged background, Lady Kofoworola traveled to England and completed her secondary school education at Portway College. Soon after, she was granted admission to University of Oxford, where she graduated with a bachelor's degree in English. Lady Kofoworola has the honor of being the first African woman to be admitted to the University of Oxford, in 1933.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nigerian Women Pioneers &amp; Icons|last=Awe|first=Bolanle|publisher=Childsplay Books Limited|year=2016|isbn=978-978-35455-6-4|location=Oyo State, Nigeria|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most educated, elite women coming from Lagos were members of prominent Christian families of nineteenth and twentieth-century Nigeria.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aderinto|first=Saheed|title=Of Gender, Race, and Class: The Politics of Prostitution in Lagos, Nigeria, 1923–1954|journal= Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=33|issue=3|pages=71–92|jstor=10.5250/fronjwomestud.33.3.0071|doi=10.5250/fronjwomestud.33.3.0071|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nigerian pioneers like Charlotte Olajumoke Obasa, Oyinkan Abayomi, and [[Kofoworola Ademola]], among others, completed a Western education in an array of subjects ranging from music, law, social science, to education, nursing and journalism in both Nigeria and abroad.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Collectively, these women broke notable barriers and certain taboos that were social norms within the Victorian and post-Victorian era.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

With a Western education from Oxford, Lady Kofoworola returned to Nigeria and briefly taught at [[Queen's College, Lagos|Queen's College, Lagos]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; As a teacher, Kofoworola encouraged many of the girls to work hard in order to become achievers; her famous slogan was “brains have no gender”.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; With her passion towards girls’ education, Lady Kofoworola encouraged her communities to establish non-governmental organizations that stimulate the education of women.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; With gradual pace, she became one of the founding members of the Nigerian Association of University Women, whose sole aim was the ultimate encouragement of girls’ education in Nigeria.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

In order to increase the rather limited opportunities for Nigerian girls in secondary education, Lady Kofoworola was heavily involved in founding new secondary schools for girls. An example could be the New Era Girls’ College, a secondary school where she served as the Headmistress.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Lady Kofoworola was a prominent volunteer for the Red Cross Society where she served as the first Nigerian Director of the Western Region branch.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In recognition of her contribution in several respected fields, Lady Kofoworola was bestowed with many honors. In 1959, she became a Member of the British Empire (MBE), where she was later granted, Officer of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (OFR).&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Role of men in African feminism ==
The goal of feminism is to empower women so as to ensure equality to men. For some people, the term ''feminism'' incorrectly came to mean a movement that was anti-male, anti-culture and anti-religion.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Conceptualizing Feminism(s) in Africa: The Challenges Facing African Women Writers and Critics|last=Nkealah|first=Naomi|publisher=English Academy Review|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=133–141|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For purposes of inclusion, some women prefer to engage themselves in gender theory and activism by including men into the discussion because it promotes the idea that feminism is about equality among all genders and it is important to note that they also face hardships as males.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10130950.2002.9676183 |doi = 10.1080/10130950.2002.9676183|title = Transcending incongruities: Rethinking feminism and the dynamics of identity in Africa|journal = Agenda|volume = 17|issue = 54|pages = 92–98|date = January 2002|last1 = Kolawole|first1 = Mary Modupe|doi-broken-date = 2019-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the majority of policy-makers in many African countries are men, some believe that inclusivity is important if women are to gain ground in policy changes that impact them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The importance that many women place on [[communalism]] and family results in their desire to work with men to develop an inclusive approach to solving gender issues. In order to eradicate the oppression women face because of their gender, working with men has become a necessity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The role of African men in feminism is nuanced and depends on location, environment, and personal ideology.

== Variants of African feminism ==
=== Womanism ===
{{main|Womanism}}
[[Catherine Obianuju Acholonu|Catherine Acholonu]] notes that feminism is useful. "Feminism, has as its ultimate goal the triumphal emancipation of the woman as a unique, distinct individual with a mind uncluttered by patriarchal beliefs and abusive submission to tradition."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, though the general notion of feminism aims to provide women with political, social, and economical freedoms, it has been criticized as excluding the narratives and experiences of women of color, especially black women. Because of this exclusion in feminism, womanism has emerged as the African-American and African variant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ebunoluwa|first=Sotunsa Mobolanle|year=2009|title=The Quest for an African Variant|url=|journal=The Journal of Pan African Studies|volume=|pages=227–234|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  African Womanism addresses feminism from (1) an African perspective; (2) an African geopolitical location; (3) and an African ideological viewpoint.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Womanism is important because it places the feminist vision within black women's experiences with culture, colonialism and many other forms of domination and subjugation that impact African women's lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 3174287|title = Womanism: The Dynamics of the Contemporary Black Female Novel in English|journal = Signs|volume = 11|issue = 1|pages = 63–80|last1 = Ogunyemi|first1 = Chikwenye Okonjo|year = 1985|doi = 10.1086/494200}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Womanism "aims at identifying the problems relating to male dominance in society while  seeking solutions to women’s marginalization by looking inward and outward."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A variant of Womanism put forth by [[Clenora Hudson-Weems]] is Africana Womanism, terminology which she coined in the mid-1980s. Her use of the term "Africana" indicates that women-focused activism should be inclusive of women on the African continent and women in the African Diaspora. She argues a complete break from white feminism, a movement which was created by and for white women without any incorporation of the African experience. She also argues that Africana men and women have more in common than Africana women do with white women, further reason to develop a new kind of activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/HUDAWR|title=Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves|last=Hudson-Weems|first=Clenora|date=1994|publisher=Bedford Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stiwanism ===
Founded by [[Molara Ogundipe|Omolara Ogundipe-Leslie]], Stiwanism focuses more on the structures that oppress women and the way women react to these institutionalized structures.{{cn|date=November 2019}} Ogundipe-Leslie argues that the struggle for African women is a result of colonial and neo-colonial structure that often place African males at the apex of social stratification.{{cn|date=November 2019}} Furthermore, the struggle African women face are also impart to the way they have internalized the patriarchy and have come to endorse the system themselves.{{cn|date=November 2019}}

=== Nego-feminism ===
African feminist, writer, and scholar [[Obioma Nnaemeka]] discusses and defines the term "Nego-feminism" in her article ''Nego-Feminism: Theorizing, Practicing, and Pruning Africa's Way."'' She writes, "Nego-feminism is the feminism of negotiation; second, nego-feminism stands for 'no ego' feminism and is structured by cultural imperatives and modulated by evershifting local and global exigencies."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 10.1086/378553|doi = 10.1086/378553|title = Nego‐Feminism: Theorizing, Practicing, and Pruning Africa's Way|journal = Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume = 29|issue = 2|pages = 357–385|year = 2004|last1 = Nnaemeka|first1 = Obioma}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most African cultures have a culture of negotiation and compromise when it comes to reaching agreements.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In Nego-feminism, negotiations play the role of giving and taking.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For African feminism, in order to win challenges, feminists must negotiate and sometimes compromise enough in order to gain freedoms. Nnaemeka writes that African feminism works by knowing "when, where, and how to detonate and go around patriarchal land mines."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This means that nego-feminism knows how to utilize the culture of negotiation in order to deconstruct the patriarchy for the woman's benefit.

=== Motherism ===
In her book, ''Motherism: The Afrocentric Alternative to Feminism'', [[Catherine Obianuju Acholonu]] writes that Africa's alternative to Western feminism is Motherism and Motherism is composed of motherhood, nature, and nurture.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; When defined, Motherism is a multidimensional theory that involves the "dynamics of ordering, reordering, creating structures, building and rebuilding in cooperation with mother nature at all levels of human endeavor."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A motherist is someone who is committed to the survival and maintenance of Mother Earth and someone who embraces the human struggle.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Acholonu makes it clear, though, that a motherist can be a woman or a man. Motherism has no sex barriers because at the core of motherism is partnership, cooperation, tolerance, love, understanding, and patience.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  In order for motherism to work, there must be a male-female complementarity that ensures the wholeness of human existence in a balanced ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===[[Femalism]]===
The femalist model was developed by [[Chioma Opara]].{{cn|date=November 2019}} Opara describes femalism as "A hue of African feminism, is a softer tone than liberal feminism and highly polarized from radical feminism."{{cn|date=November 2019}} At its core, femalism is African and it accentuates the African woman's body.{{cn|date=November 2019}}

=== Snail-sense feminism ===
Snail-sense feminism is a theory proposed by [[Akachi Adimora-Ezeigbo]].{{cn|date=November 2019}} This feminism encourages Nigerian woman to work slowly like a snail's movement in her dealings with men in the "tough and very difficult patriarchal [Nigerian] society they live in."{{cn|date=November 2019}} Ezeigbo proposes that women "must learn survival strategies to be able to overcome the impediments placed before her and live a good life."{{cn|date=November 2019}}
