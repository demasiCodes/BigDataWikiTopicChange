Members of the minority groups thus gain full access to the opportunities, rights and services available to the members of the mainstream. 

In sociology, social integration usually goes hand in hand with [[social solidarity]].

The [[United Nations]] has a Social Integration Branch, which is a part of the [[Division for Social Policy and Development]] (Department of Economic and Social Affairs). It also issues a quarterly publication named ''Bulletin on Social Integration Policies''.[http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/sib/]
