'''Social integration''' is the process during which newcomers or [[minority group|minorities]] are incorporated into the [[social structure]] of the host society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Alba|first1=Richard|last2=Nee|first2=Victor|date=1997|title=Rethinking Assimilation Theory for a New Era of Immigration|journal=International Migration Review|volume=31, 4|issue=4|pages=826–874|doi=10.1177/019791839703100403|pmid=12293207|s2cid=41839076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social integration, together with [[economic integration]] and identity integration, are three main dimensions of a newcomers' experiences in the society that is receiving them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A higher extent of social integration contributes to a closer social distance between groups and more consistent values and practices. Bringing together various ethnic groups irrespective of language, caste, creed, etc., without losing one's identity. It gives access to all areas of community life and eliminates segregation.

In a broader view, social integration is a dynamic and structured process in which all members participate in dialogue to achieve and maintain peaceful social relations. Social integration does not mean [[forced assimilation]]. Social integration is focused on the need to move toward a safe, stable and [[just society]] by mending conditions of [[social conflict]], [[social disintegration]], [[social exclusion]], social fragmentation, exclusion and [[polarization (politics)|polarization]], and by expanding and strengthening conditions of social integration towards peaceful social relations of coexistence, collaboration and [[group cohesiveness|cohesion]].&lt;ref&gt;"PeaceDialogue".

== Definition of integration ==
Integration was first studied by Valle and Burgess in 1921 through the concept of assimilation. They defined it as "a process of interpenetration and fusion in which persons and groups acquire the memories, sentiments, and attitude of other persons and groups and, by sharing their experience and history, are incorporated with them in a common cultural life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to the Science of Sociology|last1=Park|first1=Robert E.|last2=Burgess|first2=Ernest|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1969|location=Chicago, IL|pages=735|orig-year=1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some scholars offered an assimilation theory, arguing that immigrants would be assimilated into the host society economically, socially and culturally over successive generations,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; others developed a [[multiculturalism]] theory, anticipating that immigrants could maintain their ethnic identities through the integration process to shape the host society with a diversified cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Melting Pot: The Negroes, Puerto Ricans, Jews, Italians, and Irish of New York City|last1=Glazer|first1=Nathan|last2=Moynihan|first2=Daniel P.|publisher=MIT Press|year=1964|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extending from the assimilation theory, a third group of scholars proposed a segmented integration theory, stressing that different groups of migrants might follow distinct trajectories towards upward or downward mobility on different dimensions, depending on their individual, contextual and structural factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gans|first=Herbert|date=1992|title=Second Generation Decline: Scenarios for the Economic and Ethnic Futures of Post-1965 American Immigrants|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=15|issue=2|pages=173–92|doi=10.1080/01419870.1992.9993740}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Portes|first1=Alejandro|last2=Zhou|first2=Min|title=The New Second Generation: Segmented Assimilation and Its Variants among Post-1965 Immigrant Youth|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=530|pages=74–98|doi=10.1177/0002716293530001006|year=1993|s2cid=145295141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurements ==
Compared with other dimensions of integration, social integration focuses more on the degree to which immigrants adapt local customs, social relations, and daily practices. It is usually measured through social network, language, and intermarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vigdor |first1=Jacob |title=Civic Report No. 53: Measuring Immigrant Assimilation in the United States |url=http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/cr_53.htm |website=[[Manhattan Institute for Policy Research]] |access-date=December 31, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908033733/http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/cr_53.htm |archive-date=2012-09-08 |date=May 2008}}{{cbignore}}&lt;!-- while the original url is live, it does not link directly to the full report; by comparison, the archived url links directly to a web-friendly version of the report, thus use cbignore to prohibit bots from adjusting the url-status --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly used indicator of social integration is social network, which refers to the connection that immigrants build with others in the host society. While some researchers use the total number of immigrants' friends as a measure, others use the frequency of interaction with friends. One thing worthy noting is that more and more studies differentiate local friends from immigrant friends because the former is considered more important in integrating immigrants into the local society than the latter. Recent studies, published in 2020, use access to social activities (e.g., being able to join a local sports team) as a measurement for social integration.&lt;ref name="Nesseler et al. 2019"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Nesseler|first1=Cornel|last2=Gomez-Gonzalez|first2=Carlos|last3=Dietl|first3=Helmut|date=2019|title=What's in a name?

Language is another important variable to access the degree of immigrants' social integration. A higher level in grasping local language results in more chances to communicate with local people and a better understanding of local culture. A typical question used in survey is as "Do you understand the local people's language?"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Wenfei Winnie|last2=Fan|first2=C. Cindy|date=2012|title=Migrant Workers Integration in Urban China Experiences in Employment, Social Adaptation, and Self-Identity|journal=Eurasian Geography and Economics|volume=53|issue=6|pages=731–749|doi=10.2747/1539-7216.53.6.731|s2cid=154968218}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, for instance, the fluency of English is a widely used indicator and can be easily found in a report on immigration.

Intermarriage is also an indicator of social integration. For those who are unmarried, they will be asked: "Would you consider marrying a local people?"; for those married, question will be like "Would you like your children to consider marrying a local people?"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Answers to these questions are a good predictor of immigrants' willingness to be integrated into the host society.

== Examples and uses ==
In many instances education is used as a mechanism for social promotion. Neither education nor work can be ensured without a form of law. In relation to tolerant and open societies, members of minority groups often use social integration to gain full access to the opportunities, rights and services available to the members of the mainstream of society with cultural institutions such as churches and civic organizations. Mass media content also performs a social integration function in mass societies.

The 2005 documentary "Utan gränser – en film om idrott och integration" (''Without Borders – A Film About Sports and Integration'') was a film described by Swedish newspaper [[Aftonbladet]] as "a documentary on how to succeed with integration" of migrants into Swedish society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nilsson|first1=Christoffer|last2=Melin|first2=Eric|title=Swedish terror suspect was in movie about successful integration – Terrormisstänkt svensk var med i film om lyckad integration|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article22616250.ab|access-date=17 April 2016|work=Aftonbladet|date=15 April 2016|language=sv|quote=As an eleven-year-old Osama Krayem participated in a documentary on how to succeed with integration.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "social integration" first came into use in the work of French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]]. He wanted to understand why rates of suicide were higher in some social classes than others. Durkheim believed that [[society]] exerted a powerful force on individuals. He concluded that a people's beliefs, values, and norms make up a collective consciousness, a shared way of understanding each other and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Sociology/Book%3A_Sociology_(Boundless)/01%3A_Sociology/1.02%3A_The_History_of_Sociology/1.2F%3A_Durkheim_and_Social_Integration|title=1.2F: Durkheim and Social Integration|date=2018-07-26|website=Social Sci LibreTexts|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 research review found that [[Working class|working-class]] students were less socially integrated than [[Middle Class|middle-class]] students at university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = M | year = 2012 | title = Social class differences in social integration among students in higher education: A meta-analysis and recommendations for future research | journal = Journal of Diversity in Higher Education | volume = 5 | pages = 22–38 | doi=10.1037/a0026162| hdl = 1959.13/930870 | hdl-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/markrubinsocialpsychresearch/working-class-students-are-left-out-at-university Working-Class Students are Left Out at University] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102140515/https://sites.google.com/site/markrubinsocialpsychresearch/working-class-students-are-left-out-at-university |date=2013-11-02 }} Mark Rubin's Social Psychology Research, retrieved 29 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research also shows that immigrants should be independent and proactive in order to achieve better social integration in their host countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = M. | last2 = Watt | first2 = S.

From a demographic and cultural standpoint, recent longitudinal studies suggest that social isolation or integration has shown to increase in older Spanish individuals, especially those whom may be suffering from neurocognitive disorders such as dementia and overall cognitive decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zunzunegui|first1=et, al.|title=Social Networks, Social Integration, and Social Engagement Determine Cognitive Decline in Community-dwelling Spanish Older Adults|url= |journal=The Journals of Gerontology.

The [[United Nations]] has a Social Integration Branch, which is a part of the [[Division for Social Policy and Development]] (Department of Economic and Social Affairs).

== Mutual Understanding ==
In migration and integration education and in social institutions such as community organizations, in schools, engaged volunteers, social workers, social pedagogues and helpers, one encounters different perspectives and migration backgrounds again and again. Not only people who help asylum seekers work together with people from a different cultural context, this work is also significant for social educators, social workers, teachers, counselors, family helpers, committed volunteers, caregivers, authorities and the police - as it is in general in social coexistence. Communication problems caused by the different cultures arise from the perspective of non-migrants when working in the above-mentioned areas with refugees, migrants and asylum seekers from different cultures. Misunderstandings can be caused; or actions, expressions, attitudes or statements of values or behaviors can be unintentionally misunderstood or misinterpreted. These obstacles in the way of understanding with people from a different cultural background have major potential to have negative effects that need to be overcome. Therefore, it is also the responsibility of migration and integration counselors to practice a form of intercultural communication that is acceptable to all parties involved. In a society where many people with a migration background live, mutual understanding is crucial to promote a future of appreciation, robustness and diversity from all sides. Intercultural understanding and communication is a real social challenge for social services - and for society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Sayedy|first=Sayed|date=May 11, 2021|title=What role does intercultural communication play in migration?|trans-title=Welche Rolle spielt interkulturelle Kommunikation in der Migration?|url=https://sayedy.com/philosophy/|access-date=October 29, 2021|website=sayedy.com|location=Munich, Germany|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
