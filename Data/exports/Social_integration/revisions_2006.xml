The term indicates different meanings depending in the context. In general, it connotes the process of integration of a group of persons like minority groups, ethnic minorities, refugees, underprivileged sections of the society, to integrate into the mainstream of the society, and thus to avail of the opportunities, rights and services available to the members of the mainstream of the society. The [[United Nations]] has a Social Integration Branch, which is a part of the Division for Social Policy and Development (Department of Economic and Social Affairs). It also issues a quarterly publication named Bulletin on Social Integration Policies [http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/sib/].
