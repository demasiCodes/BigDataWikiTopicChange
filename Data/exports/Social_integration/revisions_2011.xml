'''Social integration''', in [[sociology]] and other [[social sciences]], is the movement of minority groups such as [[ethnic minorities]], refugees and underprivileged sections of a [[society]] into the mainstream of societies. Members of the minority groups thus gain full access to the opportunities, rights and services available to the members of the mainstream.

The [[United Nations]] has a Social Integration Branch, which is a part of the [[Division for Social Policy and Development]] (Department of Economic and Social Affairs). It also issues a quarterly publication named ''Bulletin on Social Integration Policies''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/sib/]&lt;/ref&gt; The UN Alliance of Civilizations&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unaoc.org/%20Official%20Webpage%20]&lt;/ref&gt; initiative works on Migration and Integration as a key for intercultural understanding. An Online Community on Migration and Integration&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unaoc.org/communities/migrationintegration%20]&lt;/ref&gt; shows Good Practices from around the world.

In the emerging world of social networking applications on the internet, social integration is a term that can be considered when members are being transparent in all of their various work, personal, faith and local community interactions. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
