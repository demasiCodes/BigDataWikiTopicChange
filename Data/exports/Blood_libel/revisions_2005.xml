The alleged victims are often [[child sacrifice|children]].

[[Jew]]s are the most common target of blood libels, but many other groups have been accused, including [[Christianity|Christian]]s, [[Cathar]]s, [[Knights Templar]], [[Witches]], Christian [[heresy|heretics]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]s, [[Roma (people)|Roma]], [[Wiccan]]s, [[Druidry|Druid]]s, [[neopagan]]s, [[satanic ritual abuse|Satanic cultists]], and [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Protestant]] [[missionaries]].

== Blood libel against followers of Ancient Greek religion ==
When the [[Christianization]] of Greece occurred, there was an attempt to portray all sacrifices as blood sacrifices, but contrary to popular Christian myth sacrifices to the Greek gods were typically in the forms of wealth. Human blood sacrifices were exceedingly rare and, in most Greek cities they were illegal. Early Christians spread myths about Christian children being abducted and having their throats slit in various temples. Such myths are similar to the [[blood libel]] accusations against Jews. Human blood sacrifices were seen by the Greek people as barbaric and laws against them were believed to be part of what separated the Greeks from those they considered barbarians, even after Romanization occurred.

== Blood libel against Jews ==
:''Main article'': [[Blood libel against Jews]]

Blood libels against the Jews were a common form of [[anti-semitism]] during the Middle Ages, though there is obviously no ritual involving human blood in Jewish law or custom.  Though the first recorded instance was in the writings of [[Apion]], who claimed that the Jews sacrificed Greek victims in the Temple, there are no existent records of the blood libel against the Jews from that period until the legend surrounding [[William of Norwich]] in the 12th century, but the libel afterward became an increasingly common accusation.  In many cases, anti-Semitic blood libels served as the basis for a ''blood libel cult'', in which the alleged victim of human sacrifice was worshipped as a Christian martyr, but the claim has pre-Christian origins. Many Jews were killed as a result of false blood libels, which continued into the 20th century, with the [[Menahem Mendel Beilis|Beilis Trial]] in Russia and the [[Kielce pogrom]] in Poland, and the persistence of blood libel stories in the Arab world.

== Blood libel against Christians ==
:''Main article'': [[Blood libel against Christians]]

During the [[1st century|first]] and [[2nd century|second]] centuries, some [[Roman Empire|Roman]] commentators misunderstood the ritual of the [[Eucharist]] and related teachings. While celebrating the Eucharist, Christians drink red wine in response to the words "This is the blood of Christ". [[Propaganda]] arguing that the Christians literally drank blood was written and used to [[persecution of Christians|persecute Christians]]. Romans were highly suspicious of Christian [[adoption]]s of abandoned Roman babies and this was suggested as a possible source of the blood.

In the [[Mandaean]] scripture, the [[Ginza Rba]], a purportedly Christian group called the "Minunei" are accused of it against the Jews: "They kill a Jewish child, they take his blood, they cook it in bread and they proffer it to them as food." (Ginza Rba 9.1).

== Contemporary blood libel myths in the West ==

Accusations of ritual murder are being advanced by different groups to this day. In the United States, this is especially noticeable in certain branches of the anti-[[abortion]] movement, which has produced numerous charges against doctors performing the procedure.{{fact}}

One claim stated that physicians in [[China]] who perform abortions consider the fetus a delicacy and eat it.  The story, reported from [[Hong Kong]] by [[Bruce Gilley]], was investigated by Senator [[Jesse Helms]], and gruesome artwork reminiscent of traditional depictions of blood libel was featured in several anti-abortion campaigns.[http://www.jesus21.com/poppydixon/sex/chinese_eating_fetuses.html]

The only use for human fetal tissue is in the medical research field, particularly [[stem cell research]]. [http://www1.od.nih.gov/oir/sourcebook/oversight/human-tissue-use.htm] [http://www.nesu.mphy.lu.se/nectar/eth.1.html]

Another contemporary blood libel in the United States alleges, falsely, that neopagans use human blood, sexual abuse, or ritual murder, especially of children, in their rituals. Often all of the diverse [[neopagan]] religions, the role playing game [[Dungeons and Dragons]], and sometimes Roman Catholicism and liberal or non-fundamentalist Christian denominations, are portrayed as expressions of one monolithic and ancient global conspiracy of Satan-worshippers. [[Mike Warnke]] (''The Satan Seller''), [[Bill Schnoebelen]] (''Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie''), [[Lawrence Pazder]] and [[Michelle Smith (author)|Michelle Smith]] (''[[Michelle Remembers]]''), [[Jon Watkins]] [http://www.exposingsatanism.org/witchcraft.htm], [[John Frattarola]] (''America's Best Kept Secret''), [[Bill Pricer]], and [[Ken Wooden]] (''Child Lures'') are some of the voices of these libels.

In impoverished parts of [[Latin America]], members of the Marxist group [[Shining path]] tell rural villagers that Americans will kidnap and murder their children.  The purported reasons for these supposed abductions/murders are human sacrifice and organ harvesting.

== The decline of belief in ritual murder ==

Belief in ritual murder has gradually disappeared from mainstream Christianity, and child-martyrs have been purged from the official Catholic calendar of saints.  Nevertheless, similar accusations are still being made by some Muslim groups against the Jews, and the same accusations were defended by [[Nazism]] and related movements in the twentieth century.
