''Jewish Questions: Responsa on Sephardic Life in the Early Modern Period'', Princeton University Press, 2008, p. 8. "In the period from the twelfth to the twentieth centuries, Jews were regularly charged with blood libel or ritual  murder—false claims that Jews kidnapped and murdered Christian children as part of a Jewish religious ritual."&lt;/ref&gt; that religious minorities, almost always [[Jew]]s, murder children to use their [[human blood|blood]] in certain aspects of their [[religious ritual]]s and [[religious holiday|holiday]]s.&lt;ref name=JewishEncyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=dundes /&gt;&lt;ref name=zeitlin&gt;Zeitlin, S [http://www.jstor.org/pss/1453766 "The Blood Accusation"] ''Vigiliae Christianae'', Vol. 50, No. 2 (1996), pp. 117-124&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, these claims have–alongside those of [[well poisoning]] and [[host desecration]]–been a major theme in European persecution of Jews.&lt;ref name=Chanes2004pp34-35/&gt;

The libels typically allege that Jews require human blood for the baking of [[matzo]]s for [[Passover]]. The accusations often assert that the blood of [[Christian]] children is especially coveted, and historically blood libel claims have often been made to account for otherwise unexplained deaths of children. In some cases, the alleged victim of [[human sacrifice]] has become venerated as a [[Christian martyr|martyr]], a holy figure around whom a martyr cult might arise. A few of these have been even [[Canonization|canonized]] as [[saint]]s.

In Jewish lore, blood libels were the impetus for the creation in the 16th century of the [[golem of Prague]] by Rabbi [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]]. Many popes have either directly or indirectly condemned the blood accusation, and no pope has ever sanctioned it.&lt;ref&gt;Strack, Blut in Glauben and Aberglauben (Munich, 1900), 177 and v.&lt;/ref&gt; These libels have persisted among some segments of Christians to the present time, and recently [[Muslim]]s as well.

==Descriptions of alleged ritual murder==
[[Image:Legend of the Jew calling the Devil from a Vessel of Blood Fac simile of a Woodcut in Boaistuau s Histoires Prodigieuses in 4to Paris Annet Briere 1560.png|thumb|left|Legend of the Jew calling the Devil from a Vessel of Blood. Facsimile of a [[woodcut]] in [[French Renaissance literature|Boaistuau]]'s ''[[Histoires Prodigieuses]]'', published in 1560]]

In general, the libel alleged something like this: a child, normally a boy who had not yet reached [[puberty]], was kidnapped or sometimes bought and taken to a hidden place (the house of a prominent member of the Jewish community, a synagogue, a cellar, etc.) where he would be kept hidden until the time of his death. Preparations for the sacrifice included the gathering of attendees from near and far and constructing or readying the instruments of [[torture]] and [[execution (legal)|execution]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} 

At the time of the sacrifice (usually night), the crowd would gather at the place of execution (in some accounts the synagogue itself) and engage in a mock tribunal to try the child. The boy would be presented to the tribunal naked and tied (sometimes gagged) at the judge's order. He would eventually be condemned to death. Many forms of torture would be inflicted during the boy's "trial", including some of those actually used by the [[Inquisition]] on suspects of [[heresy]]. Some of the alleged tortures were mutilation (including [[circumcision]]), piercing with needles, punching, slapping, strangulation, [[strappado]] and whipping, while being insulted and mocked throughout.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In the end, the half-dead boy would be crowned with thorns and tied or [[Crucifixion|nailed to a wooden cross]]. The cross would be raised and the blood dripping from the boy's wounds, particularly those on his hands, feet, and genitals, would be caught in bowls or glasses. Finally, the boy would be killed with a thrust through the heart from a spear, sword, or dagger. His dead body would be removed from the cross and concealed or disposed of, but in some instances rituals of black magic would be performed on it. The earlier stories describe only the torture and agony of the victim and suggest that the child's death was the sole purpose of the ritual. Over time and as the libel proliferated, the focus shifted to the supposed need to collect the victim's blood for mystical purposes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The story of [[William of Norwich]] (d. 1144) is the first case of alleged ritual murder that led to widespread persecutions. It does not mention the collection of William's blood nor of any ritual purpose to the alleged ritual murder. In the story of [[Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln]] (d. 1255) it was said that after the boy was dead, his body was removed from the cross and laid on a table. His belly was cut open and his entrails removed for some occult purpose, such as a [[haruspex|divination ritual]]. In the story of [[Simon of Trent]] (d. 1475) it was highly stressed how the boy was held over a large bowl so all his blood could be collected.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

According to [[Walter Laqueur]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Altogether, there have been about 150 recorded cases of blood libel (not to mention thousands of rumors) that resulted in the arrest and killing of Jews throughout history, most of them in the Middle Ages... In almost every case, Jews were murdered, sometimes by a mob, sometimes following torture and a trial."&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Laqueur]] (2006): ''The Changing Face of Antisemitism: From Ancient Times to the Present Day'', Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-530429-2. p.56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Actual Jewish practices regarding blood and sacrifice==
The descriptions of torture and human sacrifice in the [[antisemitic]] blood libels run contrary to many of the teachings of Judaism. The [[Ten Commandments]] in the [[Torah]] forbid murder.  In addition, the use of blood (human or otherwise) in cooking is prohibited by the [[Kashrut|kosher dietary laws]].  Blood from slaughtered animals may not be consumed, and must be drained out of the animal and covered with earth. ({{bibleverse||Lev|17:12-13|31}}) According to the book of Leviticus, blood from sacrificed animals may only be placed on the altar of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Great Temple in Jerusalem]] (which no longer existed at the time of the Christian blood libels). Furthermore, consumption of human flesh violates [[kashrut]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

While animal sacrifice was part of the practice of ancient Judaism, the [[Tanakh]] (Old Testament) and [[Halakha|Jewish teaching]] portray [[human sacrifice]] as one of the evils that separated the pagans of [[Canaan]] from the Hebrews.({{bibleverse||Deut|12:31|31}}, {{bibleverse|2|Kings|16:3|31}})  Jews were prohibited from engaging in these rituals and were punished for doing so ({{bibleverse||Ex|34:15|31}}, {{bibleverse||Lev|20:2|31}}, {{bibleverse||Deut|18:12|31}}, {{bibleverse||Jer|7:31|31}}).  In fact, ritual cleanliness for priests prohibited even being in the same room as a human corpse ({{bibleverse||Lev|21:11|31}}).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;!-- a secondary to support the interpretations of tanakh --&gt;

==Origins of the myth==

Professor Israel Jacob Yuval of the [[Hebrew University]] of Jerusalem published an article in 1993 that argues that blood libel may have originated in the 12th century from Christian views of Jewish behavior during the [[First Crusade]]. Some Jews committed suicide and killed their own children rather than be subjected to forced conversions. Yuval investigated Christian reports of these events and found that they were greatly distorted with claims that if Jews could kill their own children they could also kill Christian children. Yuval rejects the blood libel story as a Christian fantasy that was impossible due to the precarious nature of the Jewish minority's existence in Christian Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/827036.html | title = And if it's not good for the Jews? | author = Lily Galili | publisher = Ha'aretz | date = February 18, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Two Nations in Your Womb: Perceptions of Jews and Christians in Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages'' by Israel J.

==Notable instances==
{{refimprovesect|date=September 2010}}
There have been many blood libel accusations and trials of Jews beginning in the 1st century and continuing through modern times.  A few of them are discussed here.

===Antiquity===
The origin of the blood libel can be traced back to the Graeco-Egyptian author [[Apion]], who claimed that Jews sacrificed Greek victims in [[Second Temple|their temple]].&lt;ref name=Turvey2008p3&gt;Turvey, Brent E. ''Criminal Profiling: An Introduction to Behavioral Evidence Analysis'', Academic Press, 2008, p. 3. "Its origins are found in a report made by the anti-Semite scholar Apion to the Roman Emperor Caligula in 38 CE".&lt;/ref&gt; Apion repeated anti-Jewish slurs and "absurd calumnies" first made by [[Posidonius]] and [[Apollonius Molon]] in the 1st century BCE.&lt;ref name=Feldmanp1996p293&gt;Feldman, Louis H. ''Studies in Hellenistic Judaism'', Brill, 1996, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in an attack on Jews in Alexandria in 38 CE in which thousands of Jews died.&lt;ref&gt;Per [[Philo of Alexandria]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Nonspecific|date=September 2010}} [[Socrates Scholasticus]] (fl. 5th Century) reported that some Jews in a drunken frolic bound a Christian child on a cross in mockery of the death of Christ and scourged him until he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/syriabloodlibel.html |title=Blood libel in Syria |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
Jews of [[Norwich]] were accused of [[ritual murder]] after a boy, [[William of Norwich]], was found dead with stab wounds. The legend was turned into a cult, with William acquiring the status of martyr and crowds of pilgrims bringing wealth to the local church. In 1189, the Jewish deputation attending the coronation of [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] was attacked by the crowd. [[History of the Jews in England#Massacres at London and York (1189–1190)|Massacres of Jews at London and York]] soon followed. On Feb 6 1190, all the Norwich Jews were found slaughtered in their houses, except a few who found refuge in the castle. Jews would later be [[Edict of Expulsion|expelled from all of England]] in 1290 and not allowed to return until 1655. In 1171, [[Blois]] was the site of a blood libel accusation against its Jewish community that led to 31 Jews (by some accounts 40) being burned to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=112387 |title=The Martyrs of Blois |publisher=Chabad.org |date=2006-06-16 |accessdate=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early blood libel appears in ''Bonum Universale de Apibus'' ii. 29, § 23, by [[Thomas of Cantimpré]] (a monastery near Cambray). Thomas wrote "It is quite certain that the Jews of every province annually decide by lot which congregation or city is to send Christian blood to the other congregations."
Thomas also believed that since the time when the Jews called out to [[Pontius Pilate]], "His blood be on us, and on our children" ({{bibleverse||Matthew|27:25|NIV}}), they have been afflicted with hemorrhages:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A very learned Jew, who in our day has been converted to the (Christian) faith, informs us that one enjoying the reputation of a prophet among them, toward the close of his life, made the following prediction: 'Be assured that relief from this secret ailment, to which you are exposed, can only be obtained through Christian blood ("''solo sanguine Christiano''").' This suggestion was followed by the ever-blind and impious Jews, who instituted the custom of annually shedding Christian blood in every province, in order that they might recover from their malady.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thomas added that the Jews had misunderstood the words of their prophet, who by his expression "''solo sanguine Christiano''" had meant not the blood of any Christian, but that of Jesus—the only true remedy for all physical and spiritual suffering.
Thomas did not mention the name of the "very learned" proselyte, but it may have been [[Nicholas Donin]] of [[La Rochelle]], who in 1240 had a disputation on the [[Talmud]] with [[Yechiel of Paris]], and who in 1242 caused the burning of numerous Talmudic manuscripts in Paris. It is known that Thomas was personally acquainted with this Nicholas.

The case of [[Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln]] is mentioned by [[Chaucer]], and thus has become well-known. A child of eight years, named Hugh, son of a woman named Beatrice, disappeared at [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] on 31 July 1255. His body was discovered on 29 August, covered with filth, in a pit or well belonging to a Jewish man named Copin or Koppin. On being promised by John of Lexington, a judge, who happened to be present, that his life should be spared, Copin is said to have confessed that the boy had been crucified by the Jews, who had assembled at Lincoln for that purpose. [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]], on reaching Lincoln at the beginning of October, refused to carry out the promise of John of Lexington, and had Copin executed and 91 of the Jews of Lincoln seized and sent up to London, where 18 of them were executed. The rest were pardoned at the intercession of the Franciscans (Jacobs, ''Jewish Ideals'', pp.&amp;nbsp;192–224).

At [[Pforzheim]], Baden, the corpse of a seven-year-old girl was found in the river by fishermen. The Jews were suspected, and when they were led to the corpse, blood allegedly began to flow from the wounds; led to it a second time, the face of the child became flushed, and both arms were raised. In addition to these miracles, there was the testimony of the daughter of the wicked woman who had sold the child to the Jews. A regular judicial examination did not take place; it is probable that the above-mentioned "wicked woman" was the murderess. That a judicial murder was then and there committed against the Jews in consequence of the accusation is evident from the manner in which the [[Nuremberg]] "Memorbuch" and the synagogal poems refer to the incident ([[Siegmund Salfeld]], ''Das Martyrologium des Nürnberger Memorbuches'' (1898), pp.&amp;nbsp;15, 128-130). At Weissenburg, a miracle alone decided the charge against the Jews. According to the accusation, the Jews had suspended a child (whose body was found in the Lauter river) by the feet, and had opened every artery in its body in order to obtain all the blood. Again, supernatural claims were made: the child's wounds were said to have bled for five days afterward, despite its treatment.

At Oberwesel, "miracles" again constituted the only evidence against the Jews. The corpse of the 11-year-old Werner is said to have floated up the Rhine (against the current) as far as Bacharach, emitting radiance, and being invested with healing powers. In consequence, the Jews of Oberwesel and many other adjacent localities were severely persecuted during the years 1286-89. Emperor Rudolph I, to whom the Jews had appealed for protection, issued a public proclamation to the effect that great wrong had been done to the Jews, and that the corpse of Werner was to be burned and the ashes scattered to the winds. The statement was made, in the "Chronicle" of [[Konrad Justinger]] of 1423, that at [[Bern]] in 1294 the Jews had  tortured and murdered a boy called Rudolph. The historical impossibility of this widely credited story was demonstrated by Jakob Stammler, pastor of Bern, in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;"Katholische Schweizer-Blätter," Lucerne, 1888.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated whether the [[Kindlifresserbrunnen]] ("Child Eater Fountain") in Bern might refer to the alleged ritual murder of 1294.

===Renaissance===
[[Image:Judensau Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|From an 18th-century etching from Brückenturm. ''Above'': The murdered body of Simon of Trent. ''Below'': The "[[Judensau]]."]]

[[Simon of Trent]], aged two, disappeared, and his father alleged that he had been kidnapped and murdered by the local Jewish community. Fifteen local Jews were sentenced to death and burned. Simon was regarded as a saint, and was canonized by [[Pope Sixtus V]] in 1588. His status as a saint was removed in 1965 by [[Pope Paul VI]], though his murder is still promoted as a fact by a handful of extremists.

Christopher of Toledo, also known as Christopher of La Guardia or "the [[Holy Child of La Guardia]]," was a four-year-old Christian boy supposedly murdered by two Jews and three [[Converso]]s (converts to Christianity).  In total, eight men were executed.  It is now believed&lt;ref&gt;Reston, James: "Dogs of God: Columbus, the Inquisition, and the defeat of the Moors", page 207. Doubleday, 2005. ISBN 0-385-50848-4&lt;/ref&gt; that this case was constructed by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] to facilitate the [[Alhambra decree|expulsion of Jews from Spain]].  He was canonized by [[Pope Pius VII]] in 1805. Christopher has since been removed from the canon, though once again, a handful of individuals still claim the validity of this case.
[[Image:Schedel judenfeindlichkeit.jpg|thumb|left| The story of Simon of Trent (1475), by Hartmann Schedels (1493)]]

In a case at Tyrnau (Nagyszombat, today [[Trnava]], [[Slovakia]]), the absurdity, even the impossibility, of the statements forced by torture from women and children shows that the accused preferred death as a means of escape from the torture, and admitted everything that was asked of them. They even said that Jewish men menstruated, and that the latter therefore practiced the drinking of Christian blood as a remedy.

At Bösing (Bazin, today [[Pezinok]], [[Slovakia]]), it was charged that a nine-year-old boy had been bled to death, suffering cruel torture; thirty Jews confessed to the crime and were publicly burned. The true facts of the case were disclosed later, when the child was found alive in Vienna. He had been stolen by the accuser, Count Wolf of Bazin, as a fiendish means of ridding himself of his Jewish creditors at Bazin.

[[Image:Antisemitic-church-fresco.jpg|thumb|[[Fresco]] in St Paul's Church in [[Sandomierz]], Poland, depicting blood libel]]

At [[Rinn]], near [[Innsbruck]], a boy named [[Andreas Oxner]] (also known as Anderl von Rinn) was said to have been bought by Jewish merchants and cruelly murdered by them in a forest near the city, his blood being carefully collected in vessels. The accusation of drawing off the blood (without murder) was not made until the beginning of the 17th century, when the cult was founded. The older inscription in the church of Rinn, dating from 1575, is distorted by fabulous embellishments; as, for example, that the money which had been paid for the boy to his godfather was found to have turned into leaves, and that a lily blossomed upon his grave.  The cult continued until it was officially prohibited in 1994 by the Bishop of Innsbruck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/rinn.html Medieval Sourcebook: A Blood Libel Cult: Anderl von Rinn, d. 1462] www.fordham.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only child-saint in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] is the six-year-old boy [[Gavriil Belostoksky]] from the village Zverki. According to the legend supported by the church, the boy was kidnapped from his home during the holiday of [[Passover]] while his parents were away. Shutko, who was a Jew from [[Białystok]], was accused in bringing the boy to Białystok, poking him with sharp objects and draining his blood for nine days, then bringing the body back to Zverki and dumping at a local field. A cult developed, and the boy was canonized in 1820. His relics are still the object of pilgrimage. On [[All Saints Day]], July 27, 1997, the Belorussian state TV showed a film alleging the story is true.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vestnik.com/issues/97/0902/win/stonov.htm Is the New in the Post-Soviet Space Only the Forgotten Old?] by Leonid Stonov, International Director of Bureau for the Human Rights and Law-Observance in the Former Soviet Union, the President of the American Association of Jews from the former USSR)&lt;/ref&gt; The revival of the cult in [[Belarus]] was cited as a dangerous expression of antisemitism in international reports on human rights and religious freedoms&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4humanrights.org/by/eng/reports/relig2003.shtml Belarus.

===Modern===
*1840 [[Damascus affair]]: In February, at Damascus, a Catholic monk named Father Thomas and his servant were murdered. The accusation of ritual murder was brought against members of the Jewish community of Damascus

*1840 [[Rhodes blood libel]]: The Jews of [[Rhodes]], during the [[Ottoman Empire]], were accused of murdering a [[Greeks|Greek]] Christian boy. The libel was supported by the local governor and the European consuls posted to Rhodes. Several Jews were arrested and tortured, and the entire Jewish quarter was blockaded for twelve days. An investigation carried out by the central Ottoman government found the Jews to be innocent.

*In March 1879, ten Jewish men from a mountain village were brought to [[Kutaisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to stand trial for the alleged kidnapping and murder of a Christian girl. The case attracted a great deal of attention in Russia (of which Georgia was then a part): "While periodicals as diverse in tendency as ''[[Vestnik Evropy|Herald of Europe]]'' and ''[[Sankt-Peterburgskie Vedomosti|Saint Petersburg Notices]]'' expressed their amazement that medieval prejudice should have found a place in the modern judiciary of a civilized state, ''[[Novoye Vremya (newspaper)|New Times]]'' hinted darkly of strange Jewish sects with unknown practices."&lt;ref&gt;Effie Ambler, ''Russian Journalism and Politics: The Career of Aleksei S. Suvorin, 1861-1881'' (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1972: ISBN 0814314619), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The trial ended in acquittal, and the orientalist [[Daniel Chwolson]] published a refutation of the blood libel.

*1882 [[Tiszaeszlár blood libel]]: The Jews of the village [[Tiszaeszlár]], [[Hungary]] were accused with the ritual murder of a fourteen-year-old Christian girl, Eszter Solymosi. The case was one of the main causes of the rise of antisemitism in the country. The accused persons were eventually acquitted.

*In the 1899 [[Hilsner Affair]], Leopold Hilsner, a Jewish vagabond, was accused of murdering a nineteen-year-old Christian woman, Anežka Hrůzová, with a slash to the throat.  Despite the absurdity of the charge and the relatively progressive nature of society in [[Austria-Hungary]], Hilsner was convicted and sentenced to death.  He was later convicted of an additional unsolved murder, also involving a Christian woman.  In 1901, the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. [[Tomáš Masaryk]], a prominent Austro-Czech philosophy professor and future president of [[Czechoslovakia]], spearheaded Hilsner's defense. He was later blamed by Czech media because of this. In March 1918, Hilsner was pardoned by Austrian emperor [[Karl of Austria|Charles I]].  He was never exonerated, and the true guilty parties were never found.

*The 1903 [[Kishinev pogrom]], an anti-Jewish revolt, started when an anti-Semitic newspaper wrote that a Christian Russian boy, Mikhail Rybachenko, was found murdered in the town of [[Dubăsari|Dubossary]], alleging that the Jews killed him in order to use the blood in preparation of matzo. Around 49 Jews were killed and hundreds were wounded, with over 700 houses being looted and destroyed.

*In the 1910 [[Shiraz blood libel]], the Jews of [[Shiraz]], [[Iran]], were falsely accused of murdering a Muslim girl. The entire Jewish quarter was pillaged; the pogrom left 12 Jews dead and about 50 injured.

[[Image:1910s antisemitic flier Andrei Yushchinsky.jpg|thumb|Antisemitic flier in [[Kiev]], 1910: "Christians, take care of your children!!! It will be Jewish Passover on March 17."]]
*In [[Kiev]], a Jewish factory manager, [[Menahem Mendel Beilis]], was accused of murdering a Christian child and using his blood in [[matzo]]s.  He was acquitted by an all-Christian jury after a sensational trial in 1913.

*In 1928, the Jews of [[Massena (village), New York|Massena]], [[New York]], were falsely accused of kidnapping and killing a Christian girl in the [[Massena blood libel]].

*The 1946 [[Kielce pogrom]] against Holocaust survivors in Poland was sparked by an accusation of blood libel.

*[[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal]] of [[Saudi Arabia]] (r. 1964–1975) made accusations against Parisian Jews which took the nature of a blood libel.&lt;ref name = "Berger"&gt;{{cite book

* On October 21, 2002, the [[London]] based [[Arabic language|Arabic]] paper ''[[Al-Hayat]]'' reported that the book, ''The Matzah of Zion'', was undergoing its eighth reprint and was being translated into [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[Italian language|Italian]].
* In 2003 a private Syrian film company created a 29-part television series ''[[Ash-Shatat]]'' ("The Diaspora".)  This series originally aired in Lebanon late 2003, and was broadcast by ''[[Al-Manar]]'', a satellite television network owned by [[Hezbollah]]. This TV series, based on the antisemitic forgery ''The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion'', shows the Jewish people as engaging in a conspiracy to rule the world, and presents Jews as people who murder Christian children, drain their blood, and use this blood to bake [[matzah]].
* In early January 2005, some 20 members of the [[Russia]]n [[State Duma]] publicly made a blood libel against the Jewish people. They approached the Prosecutor General’s Office, and demanded that Russia "ban all Jewish organizations”. They accused all Jewish groups of being extremists, and of being “anti-Christian and inhumane, which practices extend even to ritual murders”.
:Alluding to previous antisemitic Russian court decrees which accused the Jews of ritual murder, they wrote that “Many facts of such religious extremism were proven in courts.” The accusation included traditional antisemitic canards, such as “the whole democratic world today is under the financial and political control of international Jewry. And we do not want our Russia to be among such unfree countries”.
:This demand was published as an open letter to the prosecutor general, in ''Rus Pravoslavnaya'' ({{lang-ru|Русь православная}}, "Orthodox Russia"), a national-conservative newspaper. This group consisted of members of the ultra-nationalist [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia|Liberal Democrats]], the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist faction]], and the nationalist [[Motherland (Russia)|Motherland party]], with some 500 supporters. Тhe mentioned document is known as "The Letter of Five Hundred" ("Письмо пятисот").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xeno.sova-center.ru/45A29F2/5295297?pub_copy=on |title=Письмо пятисот.

By the end of the month this group had received stiff criticism, and retracted its demand.

* At the end of April 2005, five boys, ages 9 to 12, in [[Krasnoyarsk]] (Russia) disappeared. In May 2005, their burnt bodies were found in the city sewage. The crime was not disclosed, and in August 2007 the investigation was extended until November 18,  2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://regnum.ru/news/872810.html |title=The investigation of the murder of five schoolboys in Krasnoyarsk was extended again (Regnum, August 20, 2007) |publisher=Regnum.ru |date=2007-08-20 |accessdate=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Russian nationalist groups claimed that the children were murdered by a Jewish sect with a ritual purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://regnum.ru/news/454284.html |title="Jewish people were accused with murder of children in Krasnoyarsk" ("Regnum", May 12, 2005) |publisher=Regnum.ru |date=2005-05-16 |accessdate=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rusidea.org/index.php?a=2001 |title=Russian nationalistic publishers "Russian Idea", the article about the antisemitic movement "Living Without the Fear of the Jews.", June 2007: "...the murder of five children in Krasnoyarsk, which bodies were bloodless.

Nazarov, one of the authors of "The Letter of Five Hundred" alleges "the existence of a '[[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic sect]]', whose members kill children before Passover to collect their blood," using the Beilis case mentioned above as evidence. M.Nazarov also alleges that "the ritual murder requires throwing the body away rather than its concealing". "The Union of the Russian People" demanded officials thoroughly investigate the Jews, not stopping at the search in synagogues, [[Matzo|Matzah]] bakeries and their offices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://regnum.ru/news/454284.html Hasids were accused in Krasnoyarsk children murder, the [[Menahem Mendel Beilis|Beilis Affair]] was reanimated (Regnum, May 16, 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Суб., 08.02.1431 Hjr / 23.01.2010, 21:08 по Джохару |url=http://www.kavkazcenter.com/russ/content/2006/09/21/47126.shtml |title=(September 21, 2006): "Are the burnt children the Hasid's victims?" |publisher=KavkazCenter |date= |accessdate=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* During a speech in 2007, [[Raed Salah]], the leader of the northern branch of the [[Islamic Movement in Israel]], accused Jews of using children's blood to bake bread. "We have never allowed ourselves to knead [the dough for] the bread that breaks the fast in the holy month of Ramadan with children's blood," he said. "Whoever wants a more thorough explanation, let him ask what used to happen to some children in Europe, whose blood was mixed in with the dough of the [Jewish] holy bread." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/islamic-movement-head-charged-with-incitement-to-racism-violence-1.238209 Islamic Movement head charged with incitement to racism, violence]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Denunciations==
In late 1553 or 1554, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], the reigning [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], issued a [[firman (decree)|firman]] (royal decree) formally denouncing blood libels against the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mansel |first=Phillip |title=Constantinople : City of the World's Desire, 1453–1924|year= 1998|publisher= St. Martin's Griffin |location= New York |isbn= 978-0312187088 |page= 124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram published a series of articles by Osam Al-Baz, a senior advisor to Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]]. Among other things, Osam Al-Baz explained the origins of the blood libel against the Jews. He said that Arabs and Muslims have never been antisemitic, as a group, but accepted that a few Arab writers and media figures attack Jews "on the basis of the racist fallacies and myths that originated in Europe". He urged people not to succumb to "myths" such as the blood libel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Osama El-Baz |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/619/focus.htm |title=Al-Ahram Weekly Online, January 2–8, 2003 (Issue No. 619) |publisher=Weekly.ahram.org.eg |date= |accessdate=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views of the Catholic Church==
The attitude of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] towards these accusations and the cults venerating children supposedly killed by Jews has varied over time. The papacy opposed them, although it had problems in enforcing its opposition.

*[[Pope Innocent IV]] took action against the blood libel: "5 July 1247 "Mandate to the prelates of Germany and France to annul all measures adopted against the Jews on account of the ritual murder libel, and to prevent accusation of Jews on similar charges" (The Apostolic See and the Jews, Documents: 492-1404; Simonsohn, Shlomo, p.&amp;nbsp;188-189,193-195,208).  In 1247 he wrote also that "Certain of the clergy, and princes, nobles and great lords of your cities and dioceses have falsely devised certain godless plans against the Jews, unjustly depriving them by force of their property, and appropriating it themselves;...they falsely charge them with dividing up among themselves on the Passover the heart of a murdered boy...In their malice, they ascribe every murder, wherever it chance to occur, to the Jews. And on the ground of these and other fabrications, they are filled with rage against them, rob them of their possessions without any formal accusation, without confession, and without legal trial and conviction, contrary to the privileges granted to them by the Apostolic See...Since it is our pleasure that they shall not be disturbed,...we ordain that ye behave towards them in a friendly and kind manner. Whenever any unjust attacks upon them come under your notice, redress their injuries, and do not suffer them to be visited in the future by similar tribulations" (Catholic Encyclopedia, 1910 edition, p.&amp;nbsp;393-394).
*[[Pope Gregory X]] issued a letter rejecting the blood libel accusations.&lt;ref name="gregx"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/g10-jews.html | title=Medieval Sourcebook: Gregory X: Letter on Jews, (1271-76) - Against the Blood Libel | author=[[Pope Gregory X]] | accessdate=2007-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1985, the bones of the alleged martyr [[Andreas Oxner|Anderl von Rinn]] were removed from the parish church and in 1994 the cult of the child of Judenstein was officially banned by Bishop Reinhold Stecher.
