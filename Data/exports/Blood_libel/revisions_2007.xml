'''Blood libels''' are sensationalized allegations that a person or group engages in [[human sacrifice]], often accompanied by the claim that the [[blood]] of victims is used in various [[ritual]]s and/or acts of [[cannibalism]]. The alleged victims are often [[child sacrifice|children]].

Some of the best documented cases of blood libel focus upon accusations against [[Jew]]s, but many other groups have been accused throughout history, including [[Christianity|Christians]], [[Cathar]]s, [[Carthage|Carthaginian]]s, [[Knights Templar]], [[Witches]], Christian [[Christian heresy|heretics]], [[Roma (people)|Roma]], [[Wiccan]]s, [[Druidry|Druid]]s, [[neopagan]]s, [[native americans]], and [[satanic ritual abuse|Satanists]].{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

== Against Jews ==
{{main|Blood libel against Jews}}
Blood libel against Jews is the most extensively researched case of blood libel. Blood libels against the Jews were a common form of [[anti-Semitism]] during the Middle Ages. The first recorded instance of a blood libel against Jews was in the writings of [[Apion]], who claimed that the Jews sacrificed Greek victims in the Temple. After this there are no existent records of the blood libel against the Jews until the 12th century legend surrounding [[William of Norwich]], first recorded in the [[Peterborough Chronicle]]. The libel afterward became an increasingly common accusation.  In many subsequent cases, anti-Semitic blood libels served as the basis for a ''blood libel cult'', in which the alleged victim of human sacrifice was venerated as a Christian martyr. Many Jews were killed as a result of false blood libels, which continued into the 20th century, with the [[Menahem Mendel Beilis|Beilis Trial]] in Russia and the [[Kielce pogrom]] in Poland. Blood libel stories persist in the Arab world.

== Against Christians ==
During the [[1st century|first]] and [[2nd century|second]] centuries, some [[Roman Empire|Roman]] commentators had various interpretations of the ritual of the [[Eucharist]] and related teachings. While celebrating the Eucharist, Christians drink red wine in response to the words "This is the blood of Christ". [[Propaganda]] arguing that the Christians literally drank blood based on their belief in [[transubstantiation]] was written and used to [[persecution of Christians|persecute Christians]]. Romans were highly suspicious of Christian [[adoption]]s of abandoned Roman babies and this was suggested as a possible source of the blood.

In the [[Mandaeanism|Mandaean]] scripture, the [[Ginza Rba]], a purportedly Christian group called the "Minunei" are accused of it against the Jews: "They kill a Jewish child, they take his blood, they cook it in bread and they proffer it to them as food." (Ginza Rba 9.1).

==Contemporary usage in Western societies==
Accusations of ritual murder are being advanced by different groups to this day.

One claim states that physicians in the [[People's Republic of China]] who perform abortions consider the fetus a delicacy and eat it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Fetus Feast | publisher = [[Snopes|Snopes.com]] | url = http://www.snopes.com/horrors/cannibal/fetus.asp | date = [[2007-02-03]] | accessdate = 2007-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The story, reported from [[Hong Kong]] by [[Bruce Gilley]], was investigated by Senator [[Jesse Helms]], and gruesome artwork reminiscent of traditional depictions of blood libel was featured in several anti-abortion campaigns. [http://www.jesus21.com/poppydixon/sex/chinese_eating_fetuses.html] The only use for "human fetal tissue"  is in the medical research field, particularly [[stem cell research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www1.od.nih.gov/oir/sourcebook/oversight/human-tissue-use.htm | title = Human-tissue-use | date = [[2000-09-20]] | publisher = Office of Human Subjects Research, United States National Institute of Health | accessdate = 2007-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nesu.mphy.lu.se/nectar/eth.1.html | title = ETHICAL GUIDELINES FOR THE USE OF HUMAN EMBRYONIC OR FETAL TISSUE FOR EXPERIMENTAL AND CLINICAL NEUROTRANSPLANTATION AND RESEARCH | publisher = Network of European CNS Transplantation and Restoration | date = [[1996-02-21]] | accessdate = 2007-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another contemporary blood libel in the United States alleges, falsely, that both neopagans and Satanists use human blood, sexual abuse, or ritual murder, especially of children, in their rituals. Often [[Satanism]], all of the diverse [[neopagan]] religions, the role playing game [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]], and sometimes Roman Catholicism and liberal or non-fundamentalist Christian denominations, are portrayed as expressions of one monolithic and ancient global conspiracy of Satan-worshippers. [[Mike Warnke]] (''The Satan Seller''), [[Bill Schnoebelen]] (''Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie''), [[Lawrence Pazder]] and [[Michelle Smith (author)|Michelle Smith]] (''[[Michelle Remembers]]''), [[Jon Watkins]] [http://www.exposingsatanism.org/witchcraft.htm], [[Bill Pricer]], and [[Ken Wooden]] (''Child Lures'') are some of the voices of these libels.

[[Image:GoyaBrownComparison.png|right|thumb|Dave Brown claims that his editorial cartoon (right) is based on [[Francisco de Goya]]'s painting, ''[[Saturn Devouring His Son]]'' (left).]]
Many Jewish groups were shocked in 2003 by the British newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'''s publication of a cartoon depicting Ariel Sharon eating a baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.somethingjewish.co.uk/articles/627__grotesque__cartoon_.htm | title =  "Grotesque" cartoon award | first = Leslie | last = Bunder | publisher = Something Jewish | accessdate = 2007-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Israeli government complained to the [[Press Complaints Commission]] that the cartoon alluded to the blood libel of Jews eating the children of Christians; Dave Brown, the author, responded that the cartoon was in fact inspired by [[Francisco de Goya]]'s painting ''[[Saturn Devouring His Son]]'' and was not anti-Semitic in intent. The PCC accepted Brown's argument, stating "There is nothing inherently anti-semitic about the Goya image or about the myth of Saturn devouring his children, which has been used previously to satirise other politicians accused of sacrificing their own 'children' for political purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Independent cartoon cleared of anti-semitism | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,961357,00.html | publisher = [[Guardian Unlimited]] | first = Ciar | last = Bryne | date = [[2003-05-22]] | accessdate = 2007-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartoon ultimately earned Brown the British [[Political Cartoon Society]]'s Political Cartoon of the Year award.

Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]], during his March 2006 failed bid for re-election, said communists had a history of boiling babies.&lt;ref name = Berlusconi&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/berlusconis-communist-claims/2006/03/27/1143330959861.html | title = Berlusconi's communist claims | publisher = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date = [[2006-03-27]] | accessdate = 2007-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "I have been accused many times of saying communists eat babies," said Berlusconi at a rally of his ''[[Forza Italia]]'' party.&lt;ref name = Berlusconi/&gt; "Go and read the [[The Black Book of Communism|Black Book on Communism]] and you'll find that under Mao's China they didn't eat babies but they boiled them to fertilise the fields."&lt;ref name = Berlusconi/&gt;  Despite Berlusconi's 2006 denial that he has ever said that 'communists eat babies,' in the 2001 campaign, Berlusconi said "I can organise a conference in which I will prove communists have really eaten babies and done even worse things.&lt;ref name = Berlusconi/&gt;

In 2007, articles by the conservative American website ''[[World Net Daily]]'' repeated stories of Muslims in Iraq allegedly baking children and eating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[World Net Daily]] | url = http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=56723 | title = More cases of terrorists 'baking' children cited | date = [[2007-07-19]] | accessdate = 2007-10-20 | first = Bob | last = Unruh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=56643 | title = Report: Al-Qaida bakes little boys | publisher = [[World Net Daily]] | date = [[2007-07-13]] | accessdate = 2007-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, American [[Michael Yon]] reported that Lieutenant [[David Wallach]], an Arabic translator, had told him an Iraqi official's allegations that [[Al-Qaeda in Iraq]] has baked a young boy and served the boy's body to his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.michaelyon-online.com/wp/baqubah-update-05-july-2007.htm | publisher = [[Michael Yon]] | title = Baqubah Update: 05 July 2007 | date = [[2007-07-05]] | accessdate = 2007-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The decline of belief in ritual murder ==

Belief in ritual murder has gradually disappeared from mainstream Christianity{{Fact|date=October 2007}}, and child-martyrs have been purged from the official Catholic calendar of saints.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}  Nevertheless, similar accusations are still being made by some Muslim groups against the Jews{{Fact|date=May 2007}}, and the same accusations were defended by [[Nazism]] and related movements in the twentieth century.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}
