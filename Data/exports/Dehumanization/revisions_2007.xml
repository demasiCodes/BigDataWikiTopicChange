'''Dehumanization''' is a process by which members of a group of people assert the "inferiority" of another group through subtle or overt acts or statements. Dehumanization may be directed by an organization (such as a state) or may be the composite of individual sentiments and actions, as with some types of ''de facto'' [[racism]]. State-organized dehumanization has been directed against perceived racial or [[ethnic groups]], nationalities (or "[[foreign]]ers" in general), [[religious group]]s, sexes, sexual minorities, [[disabled]] people as a class, economic and [[social class]]es, and many other groups.

==Nations and governments==
Sociologists and historians often view dehumanization as central to some or all types of wars. Governments sometimes present "enemy" civilians or soldiers as less than human so that voters will be more likely to support a war they may otherwise consider mass murder. [[Dictatorship]]s use the same process to prevent opposition by citizens. Such efforts often depend on preexisting [[racist]], [[sectarianism|sectarian]] or otherwise biased beliefs, which governments play upon through various types of [[mass media|media]], presenting "enemies" as barbaric, undeserving of rights, and a threat to the nation. Alternately, states sometimes present the enemy ''government'' or way of life as barbaric and its citizens as childlike and incapable of managing their own affairs. Such arguments have been used as a pretext for [[colonialism]].

[[The Holocaust]] of [[World War II]] and the [[Rwandan Genocide]] have both been cited as atrocities predicated upon government-organized campaigns of dehumanization, while crimes like [[lynching]] (especially in the [[United States]]) are often thought of as the result of popular bigotry and government apathy. Anthropologists [[Ashley Montagu]] and [[Floyd Matson]] famously wrote that dehumanization might well be considered "the fifth horsemen of the apocalypse" because of the inestimable damage it has dealt to society. When people become things, the logic follows, they become dispensable - and any atrocity can be justified.

Dehumanization can be seen outside of overtly violent conflicts, as in political debates where opponents are presented as collectively stupid or inherently evil. Such "good-versus-evil" claims help end substantive debate. (See also [[thought-terminating cliché]]).

==Themes of dehumanization: scapegoating, ethnic stereotypes and racism==
A common theme (or [[meme]]) is that of [[scapegoating]], where dehumanizing the target provides a release from [[guilt]] for the person that scapegoats them, who typically begins to see themselves as a victim of the dehumanized person, rather than as a potential oppressor.   

[[Ethnic stereotype]]s and [[racism]] are among the most powerful tools used to dehumanize people in the eyes of others. The [[Nazis]] carried out a successful campaign of [[anti-Semitic]] propaganda to dehumanize the [[Jews]] in [[Germany]] in the [[1930s]], describing them as "rats" or "vermin" and arguing that they threatened the "racial purity" of [[Aryans]]. This helped justify oppression of the Jews, culminating in the Holocaust.   

In war, the enemy is generally demonized, with [[ethnic slur]]s being used to dehumanize them to the point where killing them becomes morally acceptable. According to renowned mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]], the figure of the "enemy" in Jewish Old Testament mythology "is handled in this literature in a manner in striking contrast to the Greek, pretty much as though he were [[untermensch|subhuman]]: not a 'Thou' (to use [[Martin Buber]]'s term), but a thing, an 'It' ... Now it was strange, and not a little threatening and awesome, to hear echoes of this theme emanating from the jubilation of victory in Israel, just following the [[Six-Day War|six-day Blitzkrieg]] and Sabbath on the seventh, of recent date. This mythology, that is to say, unlike the Greek, is still very much alive" (Joseph Campbell, "Mythologies of War and Peace", ''Myths to Live By'', (Bantam Books), 1988, pp. 180-184).

The empirically supported [[propaganda model]] of [[Edward S. Herman|Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] shows how [[corporate]] [[News media|media]] are able to carry out large-scale, successful dehumanization campaigns when that promotes the goals (profit-making) that the corporations are legally obliged to maximise.  Government-controlled media, in either democracies or dictatorships, are also capable of carrying out dehumanization campaigns, to the extent with which the population is unable to counteract the dehumanizing [[meme]]s.

[[The Darwin Awards]] are considered by some{{Views needing attribution|date=August 2007}} to be dehumanization as entertainment. The death or sterilization of Darwin Awards honorees is celebrated because they have removed their un-fit genes from the human gene pool. Others{{Views needing attribution|date=August 2007}} think the Darwin Awards are merely funny, without involving dehumanization. Other forms of planned circus of past eras, such as the man-to-man mortal combat gladiatorial events of the Roman [[Colosseum]], are more clearly dehumanizing since a human life is exchanged for entertainment.

The dissections of human cadavers, such as in [http://www.anatomy.wisc.edu/courses/gross/ these videos] was seen as dehumanizing in the [[Dark Ages]] (See [[History of anatomy#Medieval to early modern anatomy|Medieval anatomy]]), but now the benefits of well-trained physicians are more clearly understood.
