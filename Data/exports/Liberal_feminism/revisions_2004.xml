Liberal feminism is a somewhat [[conservative]] form of [[feminism]] - compare with "small-L" [[liberalism]]. Liberal feminism leans towards an equality of sameness with men (not a [[difference feminism]]). 

Liberal feminism conceives of politics in individualistic terms and looks to reform present liberal practices in society, rather than advocating for a wholesale revolutionary change. Feminist writers associated with this tradition are amongst others [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[John Stuart Mill]]
and second wave feminist [[Betty Friedan]].
