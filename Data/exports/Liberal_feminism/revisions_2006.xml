'''Liberal feminism''' is a form of [[feminism]] that argues that equality for women can be achieved through legal means and social reform, and that men as a group need not be challenged.

Liberal feminism is a somewhat [[Conservatism|conservative]] or [[libertarian]] form of [[feminism]] by today’s standards, although it is rooted classically in [[liberalism]]. Liberal feminism leans towards an [[equality of sameness]] with men (not a [[difference feminism]]).

Liberal feminism conceives of politics in [[Individualism|individualistic terms]] and looks to reform present "liberal" practices in [[society]], rather than advocating for a wholesale [[Revolution|revolutionary change]]. Feminist writers associated with this [[tradition]] are amongst others [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[John Stuart Mill]]
and second wave feminist [[Betty Friedan]].

== Views of liberal feminists ==
Many liberal feminists tend to support the [[legalization]] of [[same-sex marriage]] or civil unions for same-sex couples. It is their opinion that the [[government]] has no place defining what sort of consensual [[personal relationship|relationships]] individuals may engage in.

Liberal feminists also tend to be [[pro-choice]] when it comes to debates concerning [[abortion]]. A common argument given for this position is that every individual should have control over his or her own [[body]], and that this also affords them the [[Human rights|right]] to make [[Medicine|medical]] decisions regarding their bodies.

Because of this approach to [[self-ownership]], liberal feminists also tend to support legalising or [[decriminalization|decriminalizing]] [[prostitution]], a position often challenged by [[radical feminism|radical feminists]] and by the [[religious right]]. Liberal feminists tend to view the criminalization of prostitution to be a [[Legislature|legislative act]] rooted in [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] [[social control|control]] over the personal and [[business]] affairs of [[women]], and thus repressive.

===Sources of gender inequality===
Liberal feminists tend to see the following as some of the main sources of gender inequality:
* [[Gender stereotype]] and devaluation of women
* [[Division of labor]] into women’s jobs and men’s jobs
* Low pay for women’s jobs
* Restricted entry into top positions (see [[glass ceiling]])
* Lack of affordable [[child care]] for [[mothers]] who work outside the [[home]]
* Limitations on [[abortion]]
* Lack of support for women owned businesses
== Quotes ==
:''The goal of liberal feminism in the United States was embodied in the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution, which was never ratified. It said, “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of sex.”'' &amp;ndash; Judith Lorber [http://docserver.bis.uni-oldenburg.de/publikationen/bisverlag/unireden/ur97/kap1.pdf Gender Inequality: Feminist Theories and Politics, Second Edition]
