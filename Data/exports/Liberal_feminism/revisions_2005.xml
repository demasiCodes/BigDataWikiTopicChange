[[Yashar Keramati]] associates liberal feminism primarly with 
[[second wave feminism]]; first wave wanted the vote, second wave wanted social change as to stop dependence of women on men. Furthermore, he claims that liberal feminism is not a revolutionary theory, unlike third wave or radical feminism.


Liberal feminism is a somewhat [[conservative]] or [[libertarian]] form of [[feminism]] by today&amp;#8217;s standards, although it is rooted classically in [[liberalism]]. Liberal feminism leans towards an [[equality of sameness]] with men (not a [[difference feminism]]). 

Liberal feminism conceives of politics in [[Individualism|individualistic terms]] and looks to reform present "liberal" practices in [[society]], rather than advocating for a wholesale [[Revolution|revolutionary change]]. Feminist writers associated with this [[tradition]] are amongst others [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[John Stuart Mill]]
and second wave feminist [[Betty Friedan]]. 

== Views of liberal feminists ==

Liberal feminists tend to support [[Legalization|legalizing]] [[gay marriage]], as well as [[polygamy]] (which includes [[polygyny]] and [[polyandry]]) and [[polyamory]].  It is their opinion that the [[government]] has no place defining what sort of consensual [[personal relationship|relationships]] individuals may engage in.

Liberal feminists also tend to be [[pro-choice]] when it comes to debates concerning [[abortion]].  A common argument given for this position is that every individual should have control over his or her own [[body]], and that this also affords them the [[Human rights|right]] to make [[Medicine|medical]] decisions.

Because of this approach to [[self-ownership]], liberal feminists also tend to support legalizing or [[decriminalization|decriminalizing]] [[prostitution]], a position often challenged by [[radical feminism|radical feminists]] and by the [[religious right]].  Liberal feminists tend to view the criminalization of prostitution to be a [[Legislature|legislative act]] rooted in [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] [[social control|control]] over the personal and [[business]] affairs of [[women]], and thus repressive.

===Sources of gender inequality===
Liberal feminists see the following as sources of gender inequality:
* [[Gender stereotyping]] and devaluation of women
* [[Division of labor]] into women&amp;#8217;s jobs and men's jobs
* Low pay for women&amp;#8217;s jobs
* Restricted entry into top positions (see [[glass ceiling]])
* Lack of affordable [[child care]] for [[mothers]] who work outside the [[home]]
* Limitations on [[abortion]]

:''The goal of liberal feminism in the United States was embodied in the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution, which was never ratified.  It said, &amp;#8220;Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of sex.&amp;#8221;'' &amp;#8211; Judith Lorber [http://docserver.bis.uni-oldenburg.de/publikationen/bisverlag/unireden/ur97/kap1.pdf Gender Inequality: Feminist Theories and Politics, Second Edition]
