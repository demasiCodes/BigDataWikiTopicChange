'''Homophobia''' encompasses a range of negative [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s and feelings toward [[homosexuality]] or people who are identified or perceived as being [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] or [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]). It can be expressed as [[antipathy]], [[contempt]], [[prejudice]], aversion, or [[Hate|hatred]], may be based on irrational [[fear]], and is sometimes related to [[religious beliefs]].&lt;ref name=Webster&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webster.com/dictionary/homophobia|title=webster.com|accessdate=2008-01-29|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dictionary.com/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P6-TA-2006-0018&amp;format=XML&amp;language=EN "European Parliament resolution on homophobia in Europe"], Texts adopted Wednesday, 18 January 2006 – Strasbourg Final edition- "Homophobia in Europe" at "A" point&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Two words originate from ''homophobia'': ''[[wiktionary:homophobic|homophobic]]'' (adj.) and ''[[wiktionary:homophobe|homophobe]]'' (n.), the latter word describing a person who displays homophobia or is thought to do so.

==Origins==
Although sexual attitudes tracing back to [[Ancient Greece]] (8th to 6th centuries BC to the end of [[Classical Antiquity|antiquity]] (ca. 600 AD)) have been termed homophobia by scholars, the term itself is relatively new.&lt;ref name="herek"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Gregory | last = Herek | title = Beyond "Homophobia": Thinking about sexual prejudice and stigma in the twenty-first century | journal = Sexuality Research and Social Policy | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 6–24 | year = 2004 | month = April | doi = 10.1525/srsp.2004.1.2.6 | publisher = Springer | url = http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/RAINBOW/html/Beyond_Homophobia_2004.PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coined by [[George Weinberg (psychologist)|George Weinberg]], a [[Psychology|psychologist]], in the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/homophobia.html |title=Homophobia |publisher=glbtq |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term ''homophobia'' is a [[blend]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/homophobia|title= Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/homophobia|title= American Heritage Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=homophobia&amp;searchmode=none|title= Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; of (1) the word '''''homo'''sexual'', itself a mix of neo-classical [[morpheme]]s, and (2) ''[[phobia]]'' from the Greek φόβος, Phóbos, meaning "fear" or "morbid fear". Weinberg is credited as the first person to have used the term in speech.&lt;ref name="herek"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herek|first=Gregory M.|year=2004|month=April|title=Beyond "Homophobia": Thinking About Sexual Prejudice and Stigma in the Twenty-First Century|journal=Sexuality Research &amp; Social Policy|volume=1|issue=2|pages=6–24|doi=10.1525/srsp.2004.1.2.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''homophobia'' first appeared in print in an article written for the May 23, 1969, edition of the American [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] ''[[Screw magazine|Screw]]'', in which the word was used to refer to heterosexual men's fear that others might think they are gay.&lt;ref name="herek" /&gt;

Conceptualizing anti-LGBT prejudice as a [[social issues|social problem]] worthy of scholarly attention was not new.  A 1969 article in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described examples of negative attitudes toward homosexuality as "homophobia", including "a mixture of revulsion and apprehension" which some called ''[[homosexual panic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Behavior: The Homosexual: Newly Visible, Newly Understood|journal=Time|date=1969|year=1969|month=October|volume=94|issue=18|url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,839116-1,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Kenneth Smith used ''homophobia'' as a personality profile to describe the psychological aversion to homosexuality.&lt;ref name=Smith1971 &gt;{{Cite book|last=Smith |first=Kenneth T |year=1971 |title=Homophobia: a tentative personality profile |journal=Psychological Reports |pages=1091–4 |volume=29 |issue=3 |issn=00332941 |oclc=100640283 |pmid=5139344}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinberg also used it this way in his 1972 book ''Society and the Healthy Homosexual'',&lt;ref name=Weinberg1972 &gt;{{Cite book|title=Society and the healthy homosexual |last=Weinberg |first=George |year=1973 |publisher=Garden City, New York Anchor Press Doubleday &amp; Co |isbn=978-0-385-05083-8 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/434538701 |origyear=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; published one year before the [[American Psychiatric Association]] voted to remove homosexuality from its list of [[mental disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Recalling APA's Historic Step |url=http://www.psychiatricnews.org/pnews/00-09-01/recalling.html |first=Alfred M |last=Freedman |periodical=APA News |date=September 1, 2000 |accessdate=2010-08-21 |issn=00332704}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Macionis2005 &gt;{{Cite book|last1=Macionis |first1=John J. |year=2005 |title=Sociology: a global introduction |first2=Kenneth |last2=Plummer |edition=3 |publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=978-0-13-128746-4 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=P4z3GgAgMFYC |page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinberg's term became an important tool for gay and lesbian activists, advocates, and their allies.&lt;ref name="herek"/&gt; He describes the concept as a medical [[phobia]]:&lt;ref name=Weinberg1972/&gt;

{{quote|[A] phobia about homosexuals.... It was a fear of homosexuals which seemed to be associated with a fear of contagion, a fear of reducing the things one fought for&amp;nbsp;— home and family. It was a religious fear and it had led to great brutality as fear always does.&lt;ref name="herek" /&gt;}}

In 1982, ''homophobia'' was used for the first time in ''[[The New York Times]]'' to report that the [[General Synod of the Church of England]] voted to refuse to condemn homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=The Times|title=Homosexuality best seen as a handicap, Dr Runcie says|date=February 28, 1981|author=Clifford Longley|quote=Let us recognize where the problem lies&amp;nbsp;– in the dislike and distaste felt by many heterosexuals for homosexuals, a problem we have come to call ''homophobia''.|url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1981-02-28-02-008&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1981-02-28-02 | location=London}} and {{Cite news|title=New light on Archbishop of Canterbury's view on homosexuality |last=Gledhill |first=Ruth |date=August 7, 2008 |newspaper=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article4474226.ece | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homophobia manifests in different forms, and a number of different types have been postulated, among which are internalized homophobia, social homophobia, emotional homophobia, rationalized homophobia, and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060904125724/http://allies.tamu.edu/Did+You+Know/riddle.htm The Riddle Homophobia Scale] from Allies Committee website, Department of Student Life, Texas A&amp;M University&lt;/ref&gt; There were also ideas to classify homophobia, racism, and sexism as an ''intolerant [[personality disorder]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Guindon MH, Green AG, Hanna FJ |title=Intolerance and Psychopathology: Toward a General Diagnosis for Racism, Sexism, and Homophobia |journal=Am J Orthopsychiatry |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=167–76 |year=2003 |month=April |pmid=12769238 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/ort/73/2/167 |doi=10.1037/0002-9432.73.2.167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homophobia has never been listed as part of a clinical taxonomy of phobias, neither in [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM) or [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (ICD); homophobia is usually used in a non-clinical sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Paula A. |last=Treichler |title=AIDS, Homophobia, and Biomedical Discourse: An Epidemic of Signification |journal=AIDS: Cultural Analysis/Cultural Activism |volume=43 |pages=31–70 |issue=Winter |month=October |year=1987 |oclc=17873405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the American Psychiatric Association, recognizing the power of the stigma against homosexuality, issued the following statement, reaffirmed by the Board of Trustees, July 2011:
"Whereas homosexuality per se implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) calls on all international health organizations, psychiatric organizations, and individual psychiatrists in other countries to urge the repeal in their own countries of legislation that penalizes homosexual acts by consenting adults in private. Further, APA calls on these organizations and individuals to do all that is possible to decrease the stigma related to homosexuality wherever and whenever it may occur."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psych.org/ps2011homosexuality American Psychiatric Association|title=Position Statement on Homosexuality }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutionalized homophobia===

====Religious attitudes====
{{Main|Religion and homosexuality}}
[[File:Homo sex is immoral.jpg|thumb|Religious protestors at a pride parade in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]], with a sign that reads, "Homo sex is immoral ([[Leviticus 18|Lev. 18/22]])". The association of homosexual sex with immorality or sinfulness is seen by many as a homophobic act.]]
Many world religions contain anti-homosexual teachings, while other religions have varying degrees of ambivalence, neutrality, or incorporate teachings regarding homosexuals as [[third gender]]. Even within some religions which generally discourage homosexuality, there are also people who view homosexuality positively, and some [[religious denomination]]s bless or conduct [[same-sex marriages]]. There also exist so-called [[Queer religion]]s, dedicated to serving the spiritual needs of [[LGBTQI]] persons. [[Queer theology]] seeks to provide a counterpoint to religious homophobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mccchurch.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Resources&amp;Template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=614#queerspirit|title= Queer Spirituality}}{{Dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Christianity and the Bible=====
{{Main|Christianity and homosexuality|The Bible and homosexuality}}
The Bible, especially the [[Old Testament]], contains some passages commonly interpreted as condemning homosexuality or same-gender sexual relations. [[Leviticus]] 18:22, says "Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination." The destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] is also commonly seen as a condemnation of homosexuality. Christians and Jews who oppose homosexuality often cite such passages; historical context and interpretation is more complicated. Scholarly debate over the interpretation of these passages has focused on placing them in proper historical context, for instance pointing out that Sodom's sins are historically interpreted as being other than homosexuality, and on the translation of rare or unusual words in the passages in question. In ''Religion Dispatches'' magazine, Candace Chellew-Hodge argues that the six or so verses that are often cited to condemn LGBT people are referring instead to "abusive sex." She states that the Bible has no condemnation for "loving, committed, gay and lesbian relationships" and that [[Jesus]] was silent on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religiondispatches.org/blog/sexandgender/802/the_%22gay%22_princess_di_bible/ Religion Dispatches magazine, Candace Chellew-Hodge]&lt;/ref&gt;

The official teaching of the [[Homosexuality and Roman Catholicism|Catholic Church regarding homosexuality]] is that same-sex behavior should not be expressed.&lt;ref&gt;In the United States, a February 2012 [[Pew Research Center]] poll shows that Catholics support [[gay marriage]] by a margin of 52% to 37%.({{cite web|author=ANALYSIS February 7, 2012 |url=http://www.pewforum.org/Gay-Marriage-and-Homosexuality/Religion-and-Attitudes-Toward-Same-Sex-Marriage.aspx |title=Religion and Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Marriage - Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life |publisher=Pewforum.org |date=2012-02-07 |accessdate=2012-07-05}}) That is a shift upwards from 2010, when 46% of Catholics favored gay marriage.(Biden's support for gay marriage matches most Catholics' views, By Dan Gilgoff, CNN.com Religion Editor [http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/07/bidens-support-for-gay-marriage-matches-most-catholics-views/])&lt;/ref&gt; The Catechism of the Catholic Church States that, "'homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.'...They are contrary to the natural law.... Under no circumstances can they be approved."&lt;ref&gt;Ratzinger J., et al. 1995. Part Three Life in Christ. In: Catechism of the Catholic Church. 1540 Broadway, New York, New York: Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, Inc. p. 625.&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church also campaigns politically against LGBT rights.

=====Islam and sharia=====
{{Main|Homosexuality and Islam}}
In some cases, the distinction between religious homophobia and state-sponsored homophobia is not clear, a key example being territories under [[Islamic]] authority. All major [[Islamic sects]] [[Homosexuality and Islam|forbid homosexuality]], which is a crime under [[Sharia Law]] and treated as such in most [[Muslim]] countries. In [[Afghanistan]], for instance, homosexuality carried the death penalty under the [[Taliban]]. After their fall, homosexuality went from a capital crime to one punished with fines and prison sentences. The legal situation in the [[United Arab Emirates]], however, is unclear.

In 2009, the [[International Lesbian and Gay Association]] (ILGA) published a report entitled ''State Sponsored Homophobia 2009'',&lt;ref name="ilga.org"&gt;[http://www.ilga.org/statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2009.pdf ILGA: 2009 Report on State Sponsored Homophobia (2009)]{{Dead link|date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on research carried out by Daniel Ottosson at Södertörn University College, Stockholm, Sweden.

In medieval Europe, homosexuality was considered [[sodomy]] and was punishable by death. Persecutions reached their height during the [[Medieval Inquisition]]s, when the sects of [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]] were accused of fornication and sodomy, alongside accusations of satanism. In 1307, accusations of sodomy and homosexuality were major charges leveled during the [[Trial of the Knights Templar]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman "The Guilt of the Templars" (New York: Basic Books, 1966): 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] was influential in linking condemnations of homosexuality with the idea of [[natural law]], arguing that "special sins are against nature, as, for instance, those that run counter to the intercourse of male and female natural to animals, and so are peculiarly qualified as unnatural vices."&lt;ref name="civ2"&gt;Crompton, Louis, ''Homosexuality and Civilization'', Harvard University, 2003. Page 187&lt;/ref&gt;

Although bisexuality was accepted as normal human behavior in Ancient China,&lt;ref name="civ"&gt;Crompton, Louis, ''Homosexuality and Civilization'', Harvard University, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; homophobia became ingrained in the late [[Qing Dynasty]] and the [[Republic of China]] from interactions with the Christian West,&lt;ref name="Kang1"&gt;Kang, Wenqing.

Despite there being no law in the [[communist]] People's Republic against homosexuality, "police regularly rounded up gays and lesbians." Other laws were used to prosecute homosexual people and they were "charged with hooliganism or disturbing public order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = History of Chinese homosexuality|date= 2004-04-01 | work = Shanghai Star| accessdate= July 3, 2009 |url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-04/01/content_319807.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soviet Union]] under [[Vladimir Lenin]] decriminalized homosexuality in 1922, long before many other European countries. The [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]] effectively legalized no-fault divorce, abortion and homosexuality, when they abolished all the old [[Russian Empire|Tsarist]] laws and the initial Soviet criminal code kept these liberal sexual policies in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unity and diversity in socialist law |last=Hazard |first=John N |author2=Columbia University.

===Internalized homophobia===

Some less overt behaviors may include making assumptions about the gender of a person's romantic partner, or about gender roles.&lt;ref name=Herek/&gt; Some researchers also apply this label to LGBT people who support "compromise" policies, such as those that find [[civil union]]s acceptable in place of [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;Marriage amendments and psychological distress in lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults.

Some studies have shown that people who are homophobic are more likely to have repressed homosexual desires.&lt;ref&gt;Summarized in an [[American Psychological Association]] press release, August 1996: "[http://web.archive.org/web/20040202035152/www.apa.org/releases/homophob.html New Study Links Homophobia with Homosexual Arousal]".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, a controlled study of 64 heterosexual men (half said they were homophobic by experience, with self-reported orientation) at the University of Georgia found that men who were found to be homophobic (as measured by the Index of Homophobia)&lt;ref name=Adams96/&gt; were considerably more likely to experience more erectile responses when exposed to homoerotic images than non-homophobic men.&lt;ref name=apa&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/therapeutic-response.pdf|title= Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study in 2012 arrived at similar results when researchers found that students who came from "the most rigid anti-gay homes" were most likely to reveal repressed homosexual attraction.&lt;ref name=week&gt;[http://dbhs.edlioschool.com/ourpages/auto/2011/5/8/52562172/4-27%20Articles.pdf Why Homophobes Hate, ''The Week'', April 27, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers noted that this explained why some religious leaders who denounce homosexuality are later revealed to have secret homosexual relations.&lt;ref name=week/&gt; The researchers noted that "these people are at war with themselves and are turning this internal conflict outward."&lt;ref name=week/&gt;

Researcher Iain R. Williamson, in his 1998 work "Internalized Homophobia and Health Issues Affecting Lesbians and Gay Men" finds the term ''homophobia'' to be "highly problematic" but for reasons of continuity and consistency with the majority of other publications on the issue retains its use rather than using more accurate but obscure terminology.&lt;ref name=Iain&gt;Oxford Journal of Medicine, Health Education Research, Volume 15, Issue 1, Pp. 97-107, Iain R. Williamson, in their 1998 work "Internalized Homophobia and Health Issues Affecting Lesbians and Gay Men."&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''internalized sexual stigma'' is sometimes used in place to represent internalized homophobia.&lt;!-- This sentence is grammatically awkward. I'm not sure how to phase it better though. --&gt;&lt;ref name="apa"/&gt; An internalized stigma arises when a person believes negative stereotypes about themselves, regardless of where the stereotype come from. It can also refer to many stereotypes beyond sexuality and [[gender role]]s. Internalized homophobia can cause discomfort with and disapproval of one's own [[sexual orientation]]. [[Ego-dystonic sexual orientation]] or [[egodystonic]] homophobia, for instance, is a condition characterized by having a [[sexual orientation]] or an attraction that is at odds with one's idealized [[self-image]], causing [[anxiety]] and a desire to change one's orientation or become more comfortable with one's sexual orientation. Such a situation may cause extreme repression of homosexual desires.&lt;ref name=Adams96/&gt; In other cases, a conscious internal struggle may occur for some time, often pitting deeply held religious or social beliefs against strong sexual and emotional desires. This discordance can cause [[clinical depression]], and a higher rate of [[suicide among LGBT youth]] (up to 30 percent of [[non-heterosexual]] youth attempt suicide) has been attributed to this phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Gonsiorek&gt;Journal of Adolescent Health Care, Volume 9, Issue 2, March 1988, pp. 114–122, Mental health issues of gay and lesbian adolescents, John C. Gonsiorek, Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychotherapy, such as [[gay affirmative psychotherapy]], and participation in a sexual-minority affirming group can help resolve the internal conflicts, such as between religious beliefs and sexual identity.&lt;ref name=apa /&gt; Even informal therapies that address understanding and accepting of non-heterosexual orientations can prove effective.&lt;ref name=Gonsiorek/&gt; Many diagnostic "Internalized Homophobia Scales" can be used to measure a person's discomfort with their sexuality and some can be used by people regardless of gender or sexual orientation. Critics of the scales note that they presume a discomfort with non-heterosexuality which in itself enforces heternormativity.&lt;ref name=Adams96&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Adams HE, Wright LW, Lohr BA |title=Is homophobia associated with homosexual arousal? |journal=J Abnorm Psychol |volume=105 |issue=3 |pages=440–5 |year=1996 |month=August |pmid=8772014 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/abn/105/3/440 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.105.3.440}}Summarized in an [[American Psychological Association]] press release, August 1996: "[http://web.archive.org/web/20040202035152/www.apa.org/releases/homophob.html New Study Links Homophobia with Homosexual Arousal]".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social homophobia===
[[File:RyanHalligan.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Suicide of Ryan Halligan|Ryan Halligan]] used to receive homophobic messages]]
The fear of being identified as gay can be considered as a form of social homophobia. Theorists including [[Calvin Thomas (critical theorist)|Calvin Thomas]] and [[Judith Butler]] have suggested that homophobia can be rooted in an individual's fear of being identified as gay. Homophobia in men is correlated with insecurity about masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.livescience.com/health/050802_masculinity.html|title= Masculinity Challenged, Men Prefer War and SUVs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/hiphop/gender.htm|title=Homophobia and Hip-Hop|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2009-03-30|accessdate=2011-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, homophobia is allegedly rampant in sports, and in the [[subculture]] of its supporters that is considered [[stereotype|stereotypically]] male, such as [[association football]] and [[rugby football|rugby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/sports/34787/fans-culture-hard-to-change|title= Fans' culture hard to change}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These theorists have argued that a person who expresses homophobic thoughts and feelings does so not only to communicate their beliefs about the class of gay people, but also to distance themselves from this class and its social status. Thus, by distancing themselves from gay people, they are reaffirming their role as a heterosexual in a [[heteronormative]] culture, thereby attempting to prevent themselves from being labeled and treated as a gay person. This interpretation alludes to the idea that a person may posit violent opposition to "the Other" as a means of establishing their own identity as part of the majority and thus gaining social validation.

Nancy J. Chodorow states that homophobia can be viewed as a method of protection of male masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy J. Chodorow. [http://www.cyberpsych.org/homophobia/chodorow.htm Statement in a public forum on homophobia by The American Psychoanalytic Foundation, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theories explain homophobia as a threat to an individual's own same-sex impulses, whether those impulses are imminent or merely hypothetical. This threat causes repression, denial or [[reaction formation]].&lt;ref&gt;West, D.J. ''Homosexuality re-examined.'' Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1977. ISBN 0-8166-0812-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Disapproval of homosexuality and of gay people is not evenly distributed throughout society, but is more or less pronounced according to age, ethnicity, geographic location, race, sex, [[social class]], education, partisan identification and religious status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herek|first=Gregory M.|title=Beyond "Homophobia": Thinking about sexual prejudice and stigma in the twenty-first century|journal=Sexuality Research and Social Policy|year=2004|volume=1|series=Number 2|pages=6–24|doi=10.1525/srsp.2004.1.2.6|url=https://springerlink3.metapress.com/content/e621m03x780l3047/resource-secured/?target=fulltext.pdf&amp;sid=z5ku4zncybv1dauf1k2fusad&amp;sh=www.springerlink.com|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to UK [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] charity [[AVERT]], religious views, lack of homosexual feelings or experiences, and lack of interaction with gay people are strongly associated with such views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.avert.org/hsexu3.htm|title= Prejudice &amp; Attitudes to Gay Men &amp; Lesbians}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(1995). "Keeping them in their place: Hetero/sexist harassment, gender and the enforcement of heterosexuality." In J. Holland&amp;L. Adkins (Eds.), ''Sex, sensibility and the gendered body''.

Newbury Park, CA: Sage&lt;/ref&gt; The taunting of boys seen as eccentric (and who are not usually gay) is said to be endemic in rural and [[suburb]]an [[Education in the United States|American schools]], and has been associated with risk-taking behavior and outbursts of violence (such as a spate of [[school shooting]]s) by boys seeking revenge or trying to assert their masculinity.&lt;ref name = Kimmel2003 &gt;{{Cite book |last=Kimmel |first=Michael S |year=2003 |title=Adolescent Masculinity, Homophobia, and Violence: Random School Shootings, 1982–2001 |last2=Mahler |first2=Matthew |journal=Am Behav Sci |pages=1439–58 |volume=46 |issue=10 |issn=00027642 |oclc=437621566 |doi=10.1177/0002764203046010010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Homophobic bullying is also very common in schools in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/key-projects/triennial-review/online-summary/education/ |title=How fair is Britain? the first Triennial Review |publisher=[[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] |accessdate=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, the works of authors who merely have the word "Gay" in their name ([[Gay Talese]], [[Peter Gay]]) or works about things also contain the name (''[[Enola Gay]]'') have been destroyed because of a perceived pro-homosexual bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Petras |first1=Kathryn |last2=Petras|first2=Ross|title=Unusually Stupid Americans (A compendium of all American Stupidity)|year=2003|publisher=Villard Books|location=New York|isbn=0-9658068-7-1|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, attitudes about people who are homosexual may vary on the basis of partisan identification. [[U.S. Republican Party|Republicans]] are far more likely than [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democrats]] to have negative attitudes about people who are gay and lesbian, according to surveys conducted by the [[National Election Studies]] from 2000 through 2004. This disparity is shown in the graph on the right, which is from a book published in 2008 by Joseph Fried. The tendency of Republicans to view gay and lesbian people negatively could be based on homophobia, religious beliefs, or [[conservatism]] with respect to the traditional family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Democrats and Republicans—rhetoric and reality : comparing the voters in statistics and anecdotes |last=Fried |first=Joseph |year=2008 |publisher=Algora Pub |isbn=0-87586-605-0 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/183179592 |page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homophobia also varies by region; statistics show that the [[Southern United States]] has more reports of anti-gay prejudice than any other region in the US.&lt;ref name=APCJ2005&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons|first=P.

In a 1998 address, author, activist, and [[civil rights]] leader [[Coretta Scott King]] stated that "Homophobia is like racism and anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry in that it seeks to dehumanize a large group of people, to deny their humanity, their dignity and personhood."&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Defender, April 1, 1998, front page&lt;/ref&gt; One study of white adolescent males conducted at the [[University of Cincinnati]] by Janet Baker has been used to argue that negative feelings towards gay people are also associated with other [[discriminatory]] behaviors.&lt;ref name=jetstudy&gt;{{cite news|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=0rkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12|title= Homophobia, racism likely companions, study shows|work= Jet|date= January 10, 1994|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the study, hatred of gay people, [[anti-Semitism]], and [[racism]] are "likely companions."&lt;ref name=jetstudy/&gt; Baker hypothesized "maybe it's a matter of power and looking down on all you think are at the bottom."&lt;ref name=jetstudy/&gt; A study performed in 2007 in the UK for the charity Stonewall reports that up to 90 percent of the population support [[anti-discrimination laws]] protecting gay and lesbian people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/gayrights/story/0,,2086335,00.html |title=Majority support gay equality rights, poll finds|date=May 23, 2007|publisher=Guardian | location=London | first=Hugh | last=Muir | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efforts to combat homophobia==
[[File:SOS Homophobie.JPG|thumb|180px|An anti-homophobia protester at a demonstration in [[Paris]], in 2005]]

Most international [[human rights]] organizations, such as [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]], condemn laws that make homosexual relations between consenting adults a crime. Since 1994, the [[United Nations]] [[Human Rights Committee]] has also ruled that such laws violated the right to privacy guaranteed in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. In 2008, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] issued a statement which "urges States to do away with criminal penalties against [homosexual persons]." The statement, however, was addressed to reject a resolution by the UN Assembly that would have precisely called for an end of penalties against homosexuals in the world.&lt;ref name="vatican.va"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/2008/documents/rc_seg-st_20081218_statement-sexual-orientation_en.html|title= Statement of the Holy See Delegation at the 63rd Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations on the Declaration on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity|date=18 December 2008|publisher=vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted a recommendation on measures to combat discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity, described by CoE Secretary General as the first legal instrument in the world dealing specifically with one of the most long-lasting and difficult forms of discrimination to combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=PR277(2010)&amp;Language=lanEnglish&amp;Ver=original&amp;Site=DC&amp;BackColorInternet=F5CA75&amp;BackColorIntranet=F5CA75&amp;BackColorLogged=A9BACE|title = Council of Europe to advance human rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons|date = 2010-04-01|publisher = coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To combat homophobia, the LGBT community uses events such as [[gay pride parade]]s and [[political activism]] (''See [[gay pride]]).'' This is criticized by some{{Who|date=July 2009}} as counter-productive though, as gay pride parades showcase what could be seen as more "extreme" sexuality: fetish-based and gender-variant aspects of LGBT culture. One form of organized resistance to homophobia is the [[International Day Against Homophobia]] (or IDAHO),&lt;ref&gt;"[http://ilga.org/news_results_b.asp?FileID=329 Towards an international Day against Homophobia]", April 10, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; first celebrated May 17, 2005 in related activities in more than 40 countries.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.emediawire.com/releases/2005/5/emw239185.htm 1st Annual International Day Against Homophobia to be Celebrated in over 40 Countries on May 17]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}", May 12, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The four largest countries of Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Colombia) developed mass media campaigns against homophobia since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web|publisher=Pan American Health Organization|title=Campaigns against Homophobia in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico |url=http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=346&amp;Itemid=355 |accessdate=2011-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to public expression, legislation has been designed, controversially, to oppose homophobia, as in [[hate speech]], [[hate crime]], and laws against [[discrimination]] on the basis of sexual orientation. Successful preventative strategies against homophobic prejudice and bullying in schools have included teaching pupils about historical figures who were gay, or who suffered discrimination because of their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/oct/26/gay-history-lessons-bullying-schools |title=Lessons on gay history cut homophobic bullying in north London school |publisher=The Guardian |date=26 October 2010 |accessdate=9 November 2010 |first=Jessica |last=Shepherd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that anti-LGBT prejudice is immoral and goes above and beyond the effects on that class of people. Warren J. Blumenfeld argues that this emotion gains a dimension beyond itself, as a tool for extreme right-wing conservatives and fundamentalist religious groups and as a restricting factor on gender-relations as to the weight associated with performing each role accordingly.&lt;ref name=Blumenfeld1992 &gt;{{Cite book|title=Homophobia : how we all pay the price |last=Blumenfeld |first=Warren J |year=1992 |publisher=Beacon Press |isbn=978-0-8070-7919-5 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/24544734}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Blumenfeld in particular stated:

{{quote|"Anti-gay bias causes young people to engage in sexual behavior earlier in order to prove that they are straight. Anti-gay bias contributed significantly to the spread of the AIDS epidemic. Anti-gay bias prevents the ability of schools to create effective honest sexual education programs that would save children's lives and prevent STDs ([[sexually transmitted diseases]])."&lt;ref name=Blumenfeld1992 /&gt;}}

==Criticism of meaning and purpose==

===Distinctions and proposed alternatives===
Researchers have proposed alternative terms to describe prejudice and discrimination against [[LGBT]] people. Some of these alternatives show more [[Transparency (linguistic)#Descriptive|semantic transparency]] while others do not include -''[[phobia]]'':

*''Homoerotophobia'', being a possible precursor term to ''homophobia'', was coined by Wainwright Churchill and documented in ''Homosexual Behavior Among Males'' in 1967.

*The etymology of ''homophobia'' citing the union of ''homos'' and ''phobos'' is the basis for [[LGBT history|LGBT historian]] Boswell's criticism of the term and for his suggestion in 1980 of the alternative ''homosexophobia''.&lt;ref name = BOS1980&gt;{{Cite book|title=Christianity, social tolerance, and homosexuality: Gay people in Western Europe from the beginning of the Christian era to the fourteenth century |first=John |last=Boswell |publisher=Chicago: University of Chicago Press |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Homonegativity'' is based on the term ''homonegativism'' used by Hudson and Ricketts in a 1980 paper; they coined the term for their research in order to avoid ''homophobia'', which they regarded as being unscientific in its presumption of motivation.&lt;ref name=Hudson1980 &gt;{{Cite book|title=A strategy for the measurement of homophobia. |last=Hudson |first=WW |last2=Ricketts |first2=WA |journal=[[Journal of Homosexuality]] |pages=357–72 |volume=5 |issue=4 |year=1980 |issn=00918369 |oclc=115532547 |doi=10.1300/J082v05n04_02 |pmid=7204951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Heterosexism]]'' refers to a system of negative attitudes, bias, and discrimination in favour of opposite-sex sexual orientation and relationships.&lt;ref name="JungSmith"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jung|first=Patricia Beattie|coauthors=Smith, Ralph F.|title=Heterosexism: An Ethical Challenge|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1993|isbn=0-7914-1696-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;13&lt;/sup&gt; It can include the presumption that everyone is heterosexual or that opposite-sex attractions and relationships are the only [[norm (sociology)|norm]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.granddictionnaire.com/btml/fra/r_motclef/index800_1.asp |title=Avis au public |publisher=Granddictionnaire.com |accessdate=2010-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore superior.

*''Sexual prejudice''&amp;nbsp;– Researcher at the [[University of California, Davis]] [[Gregory M. Herek]] preferred ''sexual prejudice'' as being descriptive, free of presumptions about motivations, and lacking value judgments as to the irrationality or immorality of those so labeled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Herek GM |title=The context of [[Gay bashing|anti-gay]] violence: Notes on cultural and psychological heterosexism |journal=J Interpers Violence |volume=5 |pages=316–33 |year=1990 |doi=10.1177/088626090005003006|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herek |first=Gregory M. |title=The psychology of sexual prejudice |journal=Curr Dir Psychol Sci |volume=9 |url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/Current_Directions_preprint.pdf |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He compared ''homophobia'', ''heterosexism'', and ''sexual prejudice'', and, in preferring the third term, noted that ''homophobia'' was "probably more widely used and more often criticized." He also observed that "Its critics note that homophobia implicitly suggests that antigay attitudes are best understood as an irrational fear and that they represent a form of individual [[psychopathology]] rather than a socially reinforced prejudice."

===Opposition===
People and groups have objected to the use of the term "homophobia".&lt;ref name="Banks2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Banks|first=James A.|title=Encyclopedia of Diversity in Education|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yDDqLBBk7BcC&amp;pg=PA1093|accessdate=17 December 2012|date=2012-05-24|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781412981521|pages=1093–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Patterson2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=Eric|title=On Brokeback Mountain: Meditations About Masculinity, Fear, and Love in the Story and the Film|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=H2IM8prnsxQC&amp;pg=PR42|accessdate=17 December 2012|date=2008-03-31|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739121658|pages=42–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Warhol-DownHerndl2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warhol-Down|first1=Robyn|last2=Herndl|first2=Diane Price|title=Feminisms Redux: An Anthology of Literary Theory and Criticism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZuisMJOOsbEC&amp;pg=PA196|accessdate=17 December 2012|date=2009-11-30|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813546209|pages=196–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-neutral phrasing====
Use of ''homophobia'', ''homophobic'', and ''homophobe'' has been criticized as [[pejorative]] against [[LGBT rights opposition|LGBT rights opponents]]. [[behavioral science|Behavioral scientists]] [[William O'Donohue]] and Christine Caselles state that "as [''homophobia''] is usually used, makes an illegitimately pejorative evaluation of certain open and debatable value positions, much like the former disease construct of homosexuality" itself, arguing that the term may be used as an ''[[ad hominem]]'' argument against those who advocate values or positions of which the user does not approve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=William |last1=O'Donohue|first2=Christine |last2=Caselles |title=Homophobia: Conceptual, definitional, and value issues |journal=J Psychopathol Behav Assess |volume=15 |issue=3 |month=September |year=1993 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n0264m864t146585/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the [[Associated Press]] Style Book was revised to advise against using non-clinical words with the suffix -phobia, including homophobia, in "political and social contexts." AP Deputy Standards Editor Dave Minthorn said the word homophobia suggests a severe mental disorder, and that it could be substituted with "anti-gay" or similar phrasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AP nixes 'homophobia', 'ethnic cleansing'|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/11/ap-nixes-homophobia-ethnic-cleansing-150315.html|last=Byers|first=Dylan|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Words with negative power|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-12-05/news/ct-oped-1205-page-20121205_1_homophobia-islamophobia-fear|first=Clarence|last=Page|accessdate=16 December 2012|date=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AP's decision was criticized some media outlets, especially those in the [[Gay media|LGBT area]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Huffington Post discussion|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/05/associated-press-ban-homophobia-discussion_n_2245697.html|accessdate=16 December 2012|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that homophobia did not necessarily have to be interpreted in a strict clinical sense.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-ap-homophobia-style-book-20121128,0,2905541.story|title=No more 'homophobia'?

====''Heterophobia''====
{{Anchor|"Heterophobia"}} &lt;!-- Heterophobia redirects here --&gt;

The term ''heterophobia'' is used by [[LGBT rights opposition|LGBT rights opponents]] to name [[reverse discrimination]] or negative attitudes towards heterosexual people and opposite-sex relationships. An [[ad hoc]] response to the use of "homophobia", it is an example of anti-LGBT [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]].&lt;ref name="noonan1999"/&gt; The scientific use of "heterophobia" in sexology is restricted to very few researchers, notably those who question [[Alfred Kinsey]]'s sex research.&lt;ref&gt;''Kinsey, Sex and Fraud: The Indoctrination of a People. An Investigation Into the Human Sexuality Research of Alfred C. Kinsey, Wardell B. Pomeroy, Clyde E. Martin, and Paul H. Gebhard'' by Judith A. Reisman and Edward W. Eichel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Dictionary of Sexuality'' by Robert T. Francoeur&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the existence or extent of heterophobia is mostly unrecognized by sexologists.&lt;ref name="noonan1999"/&gt; What's more, beyond [[sexology]] there is no consensus as to the meaning of the term because it is also used to mean "fear of the opposite" such as in [[Pierre-André Taguieff]]'s ''The Force of Prejudice: On Racism and Its Doubles'' (2001).

Referring to the debate on both meaning and use, [[State University of New York|SUNY]] lecturer Raymond J. Noonan, in his 1999 presentation to The [[Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality]] (SSSS) and the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors, and Therapists (AASECT) Conference&lt;ref name="noonan1999"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.bway.net/rjnoonan/Conf1999.html|title=Heterophobia: The Evolution of an Idea|author=Raymond J. Noonan|date=November 6, 1999|publisher=Dr. Ray Noonan’s 1999 Conference Presentations|accessdate=November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The term heterophobia is confusing for some people for several reasons. On the one hand, some look at it as just another of the many me-too social constructions that have arisen in the pseudoscience of victimology in recent decades. (Many of us recall John Money’s 1995 criticism of the ascendancy of victimology and its negative impact on sexual science.) Others look at the parallelism between heterophobia and homophobia, and suggest that the former trivializes the latter… For others, it is merely a curiosity or parallel-construction word game. But for others still, it is part of both the recognition and politicization of heterosexuals' cultural interests in contrast to those of gays—particularly where those interests are perceived to clash.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stephen M. White and Louis R. Franzini introduced the related term of "heteronegativism" to refer to the considerable range of negative feelings that some gay individuals may hold and express toward heterosexuals. This term is preferred to "heterophobia" because it does not imply extreme or irrational fear.&lt;ref name="Franzini"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Heteronegativism? The attitudes of gay men and lesbians toward heterosexuals.
