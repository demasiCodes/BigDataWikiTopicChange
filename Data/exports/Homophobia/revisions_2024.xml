== Etymology ==
Although sexual attitudes tracing back to [[Ancient Greece]] – from the 8th to 6th centuries BC to the end of [[Classical Antiquity|antiquity]] ({{circa|600 AD}}) – have been termed ''homophobia'' by scholars, and it is used to describe an intolerance towards homosexuality and homosexuals that grew during the Middle Ages, especially by adherents of [[Islam]] and Christianity,&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last1=Anderson | first1=Eric | date=17 June 2011 | article=Homophobia | article-url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1758377/homophobia | encyclopedia=britannica.com | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica | access-date=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term itself is relatively new.&lt;ref name="Herek 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Herek | first=Gregory M. | date=April 2004 | title=Beyond 'homophobia': Thinking about sexual prejudice and stigma in the twenty-first century | url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/Herek_2004_SRSP.pdf | journal=Sexuality Research and Social Policy | volume=1 | issue=2 | pages=6–24 | doi=10.1525/srsp.2004.1.2.6 | s2cid=145788359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coined by [[George Weinberg (psychologist)|George Weinberg]], a psychologist, in the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last=Bullough | first=Vern L. | url=http://glbtqarchive.com/ssh/homophobia_S.pdf | title=Homophobia | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240226053643/http://glbtqarchive.com/ssh/homophobia_S.pdf | archive-date=26 February 2024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the term ''homophobia'' is a [[Blend word|blend]] of (1) the word '''''homo'''sexual'', itself a mix of neo-classical [[morpheme]]s, and (2) ''[[phobia]]'' from the Greek {{lang|grc|φόβος}}, phóbos, meaning "fear", "morbid fear" or "aversion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | article-url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/homophobia | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625184835/http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/homophobia | url-status=dead | archive-date=25 June 2011 | article=homophobia | encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | article-url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/homophobia | article=homophobia | encyclopedia=American Heritage Dictionary | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204061410/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/homophobia | archive-date=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | article-url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=homophobia&amp;searchmode=none | article=homophobia | encyclopedia=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinberg is credited as the first person to have used the term in speech.&lt;ref name="Herek 2004" /&gt; The word ''homophobia'' first appeared in print in an article written for the 23 May 1969 edition of the American pornographic magazine ''[[Screw (magazine)|Screw]]'', in which the word was used to refer to heterosexual men's fear that others might think they are gay.&lt;ref name="Herek 2004" /&gt;

Conceptualizing anti-LGBT prejudice as a [[social issues|social problem]] worthy of scholarly attention was not new. A 1969 article in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described examples of negative attitudes toward homosexuality as "homophobia", including "a mixture of revulsion and apprehension" which some called ''[[homosexual panic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title=Behavior: The homosexual: Newly visible, newly understood | magazine=Time | date=31 October 1969 | volume=94 | issue=18 | url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,839116-1,00.html | archive-url=https://archive.today/20130824013747/http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,839116-1,00.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Kenneth Smith used ''homophobia'' as a personality profile to describe the psychological aversion to homosexuality.&lt;ref name=Smith1971&gt;{{cite journal | last=Smith | first=Kenneth T. | year=1971 | title=Homophobia: A tentative personality profile | journal=Psychological Reports | pages=1091–4 | volume=29 | issue=3 | oclc=100640283 | pmid=5139344 | doi=10.2466/pr0.1971.29.3f.1091 | s2cid=13323120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinberg also used it this way in his 1972 book ''Society and the Healthy Homosexual'',&lt;ref name=Weinberg1972&gt;{{cite book | title=Society and the healthy homosexual | last=Weinberg | first=George | year=1973 | publication-place=Garden City, New York | publisher=Anchor Press Doubleday &amp; Co | isbn=978-0-385-05083-8 | orig-date=1972 | oclc=434538701 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/societyhealthyho00wein}}&lt;/ref&gt; published one year before the [[American Psychiatric Association]] voted to remove homosexuality from its list of [[mental disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Recalling APA's historic step | url=http://www.psychiatricnews.org/pnews/00-09-01/recalling.html | first=Alfred M. | last=Freedman | periodical=APA News | date=1 September 2000 | access-date=2010-08-21 | issn=0033-2704 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203759/http://www.psychiatricnews.org/pnews/00-09-01/recalling.html | archive-date=21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Macionis2005&gt;{{cite book | last1=Macionis | first1=John J. | year=2005 | title=Sociology: A global introduction | first2=Kenneth | last2=Plummer | edition=3rd | publisher=Pearson Education | isbn=978-0-13-128746-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4z3GgAgMFYC | page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinberg's term became an important tool for gay and lesbian activists, advocates, and their allies.&lt;ref name="Herek 2004" /&gt; He describes the concept as a medical [[phobia]]:&lt;ref name=Weinberg1972 /&gt;

{{Blockquote|[A] phobia about homosexuals.... It was a fear of homosexuals which seemed to be associated with a fear of contagion, a fear of reducing the things one fought for&amp;nbsp;— home and family. It was a religious fear and it had led to great brutality as fear always does.&lt;ref name="Herek 2004" /&gt;}}

In 1981, ''homophobia'' was used for the first time in ''[[The Times]]'' (of London) to report that the [[General Synod of the Church of England]] voted to refuse to condemn homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=The Times | title=Homosexuality best seen as a handicap, Dr Runcie says | date=28 February 1981 | first=Clifford | last=Longley | author-link=Clifford Longley | quote=Let us recognize where the problem lies&amp;nbsp;– in the dislike and distaste felt by many heterosexuals for homosexuals, a problem we have come to call ''homophobia'' | url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1981-02-28-02-008&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1981-02-28-02 | location=London}} and {{cite news | title=New light on Archbishop of Canterbury's view on homosexuality | last=Gledhill | first=Ruth | date=7 August 2008 | newspaper=The Times | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article4474226.ece | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when taken literally, ''homophobia'' may be a problematic term. Professor David A. F. Haaga says that contemporary usage includes "a wide range of [[negative emotion]]s, attitudes and behaviours toward homosexual people," which are characteristics that are not consistent with accepted definitions of phobias, that of "an intense, illogical, or abnormal fear of a specified thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Plummer | first1=David | title=One of the boys | date=2016 | publisher=Routledge | location=New York City | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-h4GDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT308 | isbn=978-1-317-71212-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the [[American Psychiatric Association]], recognizing the power of the stigma against homosexuality, issued the following statement, reaffirmed by the Board of Trustees, July 2011:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.psych.org/ps2011homosexuality | last1=Isay | first1=Richard A. | last2=Sved | first2=Margery | last3=Klinger | first3=Rochelle L. | last4=Carter | first4=Debbie R. | last5=Kertzner | first5=Robert M. | last6=Akman | first6=Jeffrey | last7=Atkins | first7=Daphne Lanette | last8=Cabaj | first8=Robert P. | last9=Townsend | first9=Mark H. | last10=Ashley | first10=Kenneth | publisher=American Psychiatric Association | date=2011 | orig-year=1992 | title=Position statement on homosexuality | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827235250/http://www.psych.org/ps2011homosexuality | archive-date=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Whereas homosexuality ''per se'' implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) calls on all international health organizations, psychiatric organizations, and individual psychiatrists in other countries to urge the repeal in their own countries of legislation that penalizes homosexual acts by consenting adults in private. Further, APA calls on these organizations and individuals to do all that is possible to decrease the stigma related to homosexuality wherever and whenever it may occur.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some world religions contain anti-homosexual teachings, while other religions have varying degrees of ambivalence, neutrality, or incorporate teachings that regard homosexuals as [[third gender]]. Even within some religions which generally discourage homosexuality, there may also be people who view homosexuality positively, and some [[religious denomination]]s bless or conduct [[same-sex marriages]]. There also exist so-called [[Queer religion]]s, dedicated to serving the spiritual needs of [[LGBTQI]] persons.

===== Christianity and the Bible =====
{{Main|Christianity and homosexuality|The Bible and homosexuality}}
Passages commonly interpreted as condemning homosexuality or same-gender sexual relations are found in both [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament|New]] Testaments of the Bible. [[Leviticus]] 18:22 says "Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination." The destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] is also commonly seen as a condemnation of homosexuality. Christians and Jews who oppose homosexuality may often cite such passages; the historical context and interpretation of which is more complicated. Scholarly debate over the interpretation of these passages has tended to focus on placing them in proper historical context, for instance pointing out that Sodom's sins are historically interpreted as being other than homosexuality,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine | last=McClain | first=Lisa | date=10 April 2019 | title=A thousand years ago, the Catholic Church paid little attention to homosexuality | url=http://theconversation.com/a-thousand-years-ago-the-catholic-church-paid-little-attention-to-homosexuality-112830 | access-date=2024-04-20 | magazine=The Conversation | language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the translation of rare or unusual words in the passages in question. In ''[[Religion Dispatches]]'' magazine, Candace Chellew-Hodge argues that the six or so verses that are often cited to condemn LGBT people are referring instead to "abusive sex".

In [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], homosexuality was considered [[sodomy]] and was punishable by death. Persecutions reached their height during the [[Medieval Inquisition]]s, when the sects of [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]] were accused of [[fornication]] and sodomy, alongside accusations of [[Satanism]]. In 1307, accusations of sodomy and homosexuality were major charges leveled during the [[Trial of the Knights Templar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=G. | last1=Legman | title=The guilt of the Templars | location=New York | publisher=Basic Books | year=1966 | page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] was influential in linking condemnation of homosexuality with the idea of [[natural law]], arguing that "special sins are against nature, as, for instance, those that run counter to the intercourse of male and female natural to animals, and so are peculiarly qualified as unnatural vices."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Crompton | first1=Louis | title=Homosexuality and civilization | date=2009 | publisher=Harvard University Press | isbn=978-0-674-03006-0 | page=187 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TfBYd9xVaXcC&amp;pg=PA187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Internalized homophobia'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; refers to negative stereotypes, beliefs, stigma, and prejudice about homosexuality and [[LGBTQ]] people that a person with same-sex attraction turns inward on themselves, whether or not they identify as LGBT.&lt;ref name="Herek 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Herek1998&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Herek | first1=Gregory M. | last2=Cogan | first2=Jeanine C. | last3=Gillis | first3=J.

Some studies have shown that people who are homophobic are more likely to have repressed homosexual desires. In 1996, a controlled study of 64 heterosexual men (half said they were homophobic by experience, with self-reported orientation) at the University of Georgia found that men who were found to be homophobic (as measured by the Index of Homophobia) were considerably more likely to experience more erectile responses when exposed to homoerotic images than non-homophobic men.&lt;ref name=Adams96 /&gt;&lt;ref name=apa&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/therapeutic-response.pdf | title=Report of the American Psychological Association task force on appropriate therapeutic responses to sexual orientation | publisher=American Psychological Association | date=August 2009}}{{page needed|date=October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinstein and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Weinstein | first1=Netta | last2=Ryan | first2=William S. | last3=DeHaan | first3=Cody R. | last4=Przybylski | first4=Andrew K. | last5=Legate | first5=Nicole | last6=Ryan | first6=Richard M. | title=Parental autonomy support and discrepancies between implicit and explicit sexual identities: Dynamics of self-acceptance and defense | journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | date=2012 | volume=102 | issue=4 | pages=815–832 | doi=10.1037/a0026854 | pmid=22288529 | s2cid=804948 | s2cid-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; arrived at similar results when researchers found that students who came from controlling and homophobic homes were most likely to reveal repressed homosexual attraction.

The effect of these ideas depends on how much and which they have consciously and subconsciously internalized.&lt;ref name="Gonsiorek" /&gt; These negative beliefs can be mitigated with education, life experience, and therapy,&lt;ref name="PMID 10788206" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martino |first1=Wayne |date=1 January 2000 |title=Policing masculinities: Investigating the role of homophobia and heteronormativity in the lives of adolescent school boys |journal=The Journal of Men's Studies |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=213–236 |doi=10.3149/jms.0802.213 |s2cid=145712607}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially with [[gay-friendly]] psychotherapy/analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dreyer |first1=Yolanda |date=5 May 2007 |title=Hegemony and the internalisation of homophobia caused by heteronormativity |journal=HTS Teologiese Studies |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.4102/hts.v63i1.197 |doi-access=free |hdl-access=free |hdl=2263/2741}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internalized homophobia also applies to conscious or unconscious behaviors which a person feels the need to promote or conform to cultural expectations of [[heteronormativity]] or [[heterosexism]]. This can include repression and denial coupled with forced outward displays of heteronormative behavior for the purpose of appearing or attempting to feel "normal" or "accepted". Other expressions of internalized homophobia can also be subtle. Some less overt behaviors may include making assumptions about the gender of a person's romantic partner, or about gender roles.&lt;ref name="Herek 2004" /&gt; Some researchers also apply this label to LGBT people who support "compromise" policies, such as those that find [[civil union]]s acceptable in place of [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rostosky |first1=Sharon Scales |last2=Riggle |first2=Ellen D.

Researcher Iain R. Williamson finds the term ''homophobia'' to be "highly problematic," but for reasons of continuity and consistency with the majority of other publications on the issue retains its use rather than using more accurate but obscure terminology.&lt;ref name="PMID 10788206" /&gt; The phrase ''internalized sexual stigma'' is sometimes used in place to represent internalized homophobia.&lt;!-- This sentence is grammatically awkward. I'm not sure how to phrase it better though. --&gt;&lt;ref name="apa" /&gt; An internalized stigma arises when a person believes negative stereotypes about themselves, regardless of where the stereotypes come from. It can also refer to many stereotypes beyond sexuality and [[gender role]]s. Internalized homophobia can cause discomfort with and disapproval of one's own [[sexual orientation]]. [[Ego-dystonic sexual orientation]] or [[egodystonic]] homophobia, for instance, is a condition characterized by having a sexual orientation or an attraction that is at odds with one's idealized [[self-image]], causing [[anxiety]] and a desire to change one's orientation or become more comfortable with one's sexual orientation. Such a situation may cause extreme repression of homosexual desires.&lt;ref name=Adams96 /&gt; In other cases, a conscious internal struggle may occur for some time, often pitting deeply held religious or social beliefs against strong sexual and emotional desires. This discordance can cause clinical depression, and a higher rate of [[suicide among LGBT youth]] (up to 30 percent of [[non-heterosexual]] youth attempt suicide) has been attributed to this phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Gonsiorek&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gonsiorek | first1=John C. | title=Mental health issues of gay and lesbian adolescents | journal=Journal of Adolescent Health Care | date=March 1988 | volume=9 | issue=2 | pages=114–122 | doi=10.1016/0197-0070(88)90057-5 | pmid=3283088}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychotherapy, such as [[gay affirmative psychotherapy]], and participation in a sexual-minority affirming group can help resolve the internal conflicts, such as between religious beliefs and sexual identity.&lt;ref name=apa /&gt; Even informal therapies that address understanding and accepting of non-heterosexual orientations can prove effective.&lt;ref name=Gonsiorek /&gt; Many diagnostic "Internalized Homophobia Scales" can be used to measure a person's discomfort with their sexuality and some can be used by people regardless of gender or sexual orientation.

== Economic cost ==
There are at least two studies which indicate that homophobia may have a negative economic impact for the countries where it is widespread. In these countries there is a [[Queer migration|flight]] of their LGBT populations—with the consequent loss of talent—as well as an avoidance of [[LGBT tourism]], that leaves the [[pink money]] in LGBT-friendlier countries. As an example, LGBT tourists contribute 6.8&amp;nbsp;billion dollars every year to the [[Spanish economy]].&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite news | last=Smith | first=David | date=16 October 2015 | title=The hidden cost of homophobia in Africa | work=EconomyWatch.com | language=en}}&lt;!--{{cite web | last=Smith | first=David | date=October 16, 2015 | title=The hidden cost of homophobia in Africa | work=Economy Watch.com | language=en | url=http://www.economy watch.com/features/The-Hidden-Cost-of-Homophobia-in-Africa1016.html | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621132534/http://www.economy watch.com/features/The-Hidden-Cost-of-Homophobia-in-Africa1016.html | archive-date=2019-06-21}}--&gt; republished as {{cite web | last=Smith | first=David | date=16 October 2015 | title=The hidden cost of homophobia in Africa | url=https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/in-the-news/the-hidden-cost-of-homophobia-in-africa/ | website=[[Williams Institute]] | language=en | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626200006/https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/in-the-news/the-hidden-cost-of-homophobia-in-africa/ | archive-date=26 June 2019 | url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LGBT activist Adebisi Alimi, in a preliminary estimation, has calculated that the economic loss due to homophobia in Nigeria is about 1% of its GDP. Taking into account that in 2015 homosexuality is still illegal in 36 of the 54 African countries, the money loss due to homophobia in the continent could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars every year.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

Another study regarding socioecological measurement of homophobia and its public health impact for 158 countries was conducted in 2018. It found that the prejudice against gay people has a worldwide economic cost of $119.1&amp;nbsp;billion. Economical loss in Asia was 88.29&amp;nbsp;billion dollars due to homophobia, and in Latin America &amp; the Caribbean it was 8.04&amp;nbsp;billion dollars. Economical cost in East Asia and Middle Asia was 10.85&amp;nbsp;billion dollars. Economical cost in Middle East and North Africa was 16.92&amp;nbsp;billion dollars. The researcher suggested that a 1% decrease in the level of homophobia is correlated with a 10% increase in the gross domestic product per capita – though this does not imply causation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Lamontagne | first1=Erik | last2=d'Elbée | first2=Marc | last3=Ross | first3=Michael W | last4=Carroll | first4=Aengus | last5=Plessis | first5=André du | last6=Loures | first6=Luiz | title=A socioecological measurement of homophobia for all countries and its public health impact | journal=European Journal of Public Health | date=3 March 2018 | volume=28 | issue=5 | pages=967–972 | doi=10.1093/eurpub/cky023 | pmid=29514190 | doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study by [[Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy|The Williams Institute]] ([[UCLA]] School of Law) concludes that there is a positive correlation between LGBT inclusion and [[GDP per capita]].

[[File:NYC Pride 2019 05.jpg|thumb|The [[NYC Pride March]] is the [[List of largest LGBT events|world's largest LGBT event]]. Regional variation exists with respect to [[toleration|tolerance]], the [[antithesis]] of homophobic discrimination, in different parts of the world.]]
Most international human rights organizations, such as [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]], condemn laws that make homosexual relations between consenting adults a crime. Since 1994, the United Nations [[Human Rights Committee]] has also ruled that such laws violated the [[right to privacy]] guaranteed in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. In 2008, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] issued a statement which "urges States to do away with criminal penalties against [homosexual persons]." The statement, however, was addressed to reject a resolution by the UN Assembly that would have precisely called for an end of penalties against homosexuals in the world.&lt;ref name="vatican.va"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/2008/documents/rc_seg-st_20081218_statement-sexual-orientation_en.html | title=Statement of the Holy See Delegation at the 63rd Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations on the Declaration on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity | date=18 December 2008 | publisher=vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted a recommendation on measures to combat discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity, described by CoE Secretary General as the first legal instrument in the world dealing specifically with one of the most long-lasting and difficult forms of discrimination to combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Council of Europe to advance human rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons | language=en,fr | publisher=Council of Europe | date=1 April 2010 | url=https://rm.coe.int/168071fd86 | access-date=16 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To combat homophobia, the LGBT community uses events such as [[gay pride parade]]s and political activism (''See [[gay pride]]).'' Cities across the word use crossings repainted in rainbow colors for their annual pride parades. The first permanent crossings have been put on roads in [[Lambeth, England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/49394056 | date=20 August 2019 | title=The UK's first rainbow crossing | access-date=20 August 2019 | publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One form of organized resistance to homophobia is the [[International Day Against Homophobia]] (or IDAHO),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ilga.org/news_results_b.asp?FileID=329 | title=Towards an international Day against Homophobia | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217063659/http://ilga.org/news_results_b.asp?FileID=329 | archive-date=2005-12-17 | date=10 April 2004 | publisher=[[International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; first celebrated 17 May 2005, in related activities in more than 40 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.emediawire.com/releases/2005/5/emw239185.htm | title=1st annual International Day Against Homophobia to be celebrated in over 40 countries on May 17 | date=12 May 2005 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211224159/http://www.emediawire.com/releases/2005/5/emw239185.htm | archive-date=11 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four largest countries of Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia) developed mass media campaigns against homophobia since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first1=Paulo | last1=Lyra | display-authors=etal | year=2008 | title=PAHO/WHO &amp;#124; Campaigns against homophobia in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico | url=https://www3.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=346:2008-campaigns-against-homophobia-argentina-brazil-colombia-mexico&amp;Itemid=0&amp;lang=en#gsc.tab=0 | access-date=2023-01-02 | website=Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization | language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to public expression, legislation has been designed, controversially, to oppose homophobia, as in [[hate speech]], [[hate crime]], and laws against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Successful preventative strategies against homophobic prejudice and bullying in schools have included teaching pupils about historical figures who were gay, or who suffered discrimination because of their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/oct/26/gay-history-lessons-bullying-schools | title=Lessons on gay history cut homophobic bullying in north London school | newspaper=The Guardian | date=26 October 2010 | access-date=9 November 2010 | first=Jessica | last=Shepherd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that anti-LGBT prejudice is immoral and goes above and beyond the effects on that class of people. Warren J. Blumenfeld argues that this emotion gains a dimension beyond itself, as a tool for extreme right-wing conservatives and fundamentalist religious groups and as a restricting factor on gender-relations as to the weight associated with performing each role accordingly.&lt;ref name=Blumenfeld1992&gt;{{cite book | title=Homophobia: How we all pay the price | url=https://archive.org/details/homophobia00warr | url-access=registration | last=Blumenfeld | first=Warren J. | year=1992 | publisher=Beacon Press | isbn=978-0-8070-7919-5 | oclc=24544734}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Blumenfeld in particular stated:

{{Blockquote|"Anti-gay bias causes young people to engage in sexual behavior earlier in order to prove that they are straight. Anti-gay bias contributed significantly to the spread of the AIDS epidemic. Anti-gay bias prevents the ability of schools to create effective honest sexual education programs that would save children's lives and prevent STDs ([[sexually transmitted diseases]])."&lt;ref name=Blumenfeld1992 /&gt;}}

Drawing upon research by [[Arizona State University]] Professor Elizabeth Segal, [[University of Memphis]] professors Robin Lennon-Dearing and [[Elena Delavega]] argued in a 2016 article published in the ''[[Journal of Homosexuality]]'' that homophobia could be reduced through exposure (learning about LGBT experiences), explanation (understanding the different challenges faced by LGBT people), and experience (putting themselves in situations experienced by LGBT people by working alongside LGBT co-workers or volunteering at an LGBT community center).&lt;ref name="journaldosocialworkersapply"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Delavega | first1=Elena | last2=Lennon-Dearing | first2=Robin | title=Do social workers apply 'love thy neighbor as thyself' to gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transpersons in the south? | journal=Journal of Homosexuality | date=2016 | volume=63 | issue=9 | pages=1171–1193 | doi=10.1080/00918369.2016.1150058 | pmid=26849856 | s2cid=205471075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of meaning and purpose ==
=== Distinctions and proposed alternatives ===
Researchers have proposed alternative terms to describe prejudice and discrimination against [[LGBTQ]] people. Some of these alternatives show more [[Transparency (linguistic)#Descriptive|semantic transparency]] while others do not include -''[[phobia]]'':

*''Homoerotophobia'', being a possible precursor term to ''homophobia'', was coined by Wainwright Churchill and documented in ''Homosexual Behavior Among Males'' in 1967.
*The etymology of ''homophobia'' citing the union of ''homos'' and ''phobos'' is the basis for [[LGBT history|LGBT historian]] [[John Boswell]]'s criticism of the term and for his suggestion in 1980 of the alternative ''homosexophobia''.&lt;ref name="BOS1980"&gt;{{cite book | title=Christianity, social tolerance, and homosexuality: Gay people in western Europe from the beginning of the Christian era to the fourteenth century | url=https://archive.org/details/christianitysoci00bosw | url-access=registration | first=John | last=Boswell | publisher=Chicago: University of Chicago Press | year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Homonegativity'' is based on the term ''homonegativism'' used by Hudson and Ricketts in a 1980 paper; they coined the term for their research to avoid ''homophobia'', which they regarded as being unscientific in its presumption of motivation.&lt;ref name=Hudson1980&gt;{{cite journal | title=A strategy for the measurement of homophobia | last1=Hudson | first1=WW | last2=Ricketts | first2=WA | journal=[[Journal of Homosexuality]] | pages=357–72 | volume=5 | issue=4 | year=1980 | oclc=115532547 | doi=10.1300/J082v05n04_02 | pmid=7204951}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Heterosexism]]'' refers to a system of negative attitudes, bias, and discrimination in favour of opposite-sex sexual orientation and relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Jung | first1=Patricia Beattie | last2=Smith | first2=Ralph F. | title=Heterosexism: An ethical challenge | publisher=State University of New York Press | year=1993 | isbn=978-0-7914-1696-9 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/heterosexismethi0000jung/page/13 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can include the presumption that everyone is heterosexual or that opposite-sex attractions and relationships are the only [[norm (sociology)|norm]]{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} and therefore superior.
*''Sexual prejudice'' – Researcher at the [[University of California, Davis]], [[Gregory M. Herek]] preferred ''sexual prejudice'' as being descriptive, free of presumptions about motivations, and lacking value judgments as to the irrationality or immorality of those so labeled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Herek | first1=Gregory M. | title=The context of anti-gay violence: Notes on cultural and psychological heterosexism | journal=J Interpers Violence | volume=5 | issue=3 | pages=316–333 | year=1990 | doi=10.1177/088626090005003006 | s2cid=145678459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Herek | first1=Gregory M. | title=The psychology of sexual prejudice | journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science | date=February 2000 | volume=9 | issue=1 | pages=19–22 | doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00051 | s2cid=36963920}}&lt;/ref&gt; He compared ''homophobia'', ''heterosexism'', and ''sexual prejudice'', and, in preferring the third term, noted that ''homophobia'' was "probably more widely used and more often criticized." He also observed that "Its critics note that homophobia implicitly suggests that antigay attitudes are best understood as an irrational fear and that they represent a form of individual [[psychopathology]] rather than a socially reinforced prejudice."

===Other names===
Negative attitudes toward identifiable LGBT groups have similar yet specific names: [[lesbophobia]] is the [[Intersectionality|intersection]] of homophobia and [[sexism]] directed against lesbians, [[gayphobia]] is the dislike or hatred of [[gay men]], [[biphobia]] targets bisexuality and [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] people, and [[transphobia]] targets [[transgender]] and [[transsexual]] people and [[gender variance]] or [[gender role]] nonconformity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Clauss-Ehlers | first1=Caroline S. | title=Encyclopedia of cross-cultural school psychology | date=2010 | publisher=Springer | isbn=978-0-387-71798-2 | page=524 | edition=2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PaO3jsaGkeYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schuiling" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spijkerboer"&gt;{{cite book | first=Thomas | last=Spijkerboer | title=Fleeing homophobia: Sexual orientation, gender identity and asylum | isbn=978-1-134-09835-4 | publisher=[[Routledge]] | year=2013 | page=122 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oOxBtViD0KcC&amp;pg=PA122 | quote=Transgender people subjected to violence, in a range of cultural contexts, frequently report that transphobic violence is expressed in homophobic terms. The tendency to translate violence against a trans person to homophobia reflects the role of gender in attribution of homosexuality as well as the fact that hostility connected to homosexuality is often associated with the perpetrators' prejudices about particular gender practices and their visibility.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Non-neutral phrasing ====
Use of ''homophobia'', ''homophobic'', and ''homophobe'' has been criticized as [[pejorative]] against [[LGBT rights opposition|LGBT rights opponents]]. [[behavioral science|Behavioral scientists]] [[William O'Donohue]] and Christine Caselles stated in 1993 that "as [''homophobia''] is usually used, [it] makes an illegitimately pejorative evaluation of certain open and debatable value positions, much like the former disease construct of homosexuality" itself, arguing that the term may be used as an ''ad hominem'' argument against those who advocate values or positions of which the user does not approve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=William | last1=O'Donohue | first2=Christine | last2=Caselles | title=Homophobia: Conceptual, definitional, and value issues | journal=J Psychopathol Behav Assess | volume=15 | issue=3 | date=September 1993 | doi=10.1007/BF01371377 | pages=177–195 | s2cid=144801673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists [[Gregory M. Herek]] and [[Beverly A. Greene]] also find  fault with the term "homophobia:"   "Technically, homophobia means fear of sameness, yet its usage implies a fear of homosexuals....the –phobia suffix implies a specific kind of fear... Fear or aversion may comprise one component of beliefs about homosexuality, but other factors are unquestionably important. Several alternative terms have been offered ...These include homonegativism (Hudson &amp; Ricketts, 1980), homosexism (Hansen, 1982), and heterosexism (Herek, 1986a). Unfortunately, none has gained widespread acceptance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Greene | first1=Beverly | last2=Herek | first2=Gregory M. | title=Lesbian and gay psychology: Theory, research, and clinical applications | series=Psychological Perspectives on Lesbian &amp; Gay Issues | date=5 January 1994 | publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] | location=New York | pages=27, 28 | isbn=978-0-8039-5312-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m4I5DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, neutral use of the term has gained acceptance and usage over time since the 1990s. In 2017, the [[Associated Press Stylebook]] added an entry for "homophobia" and "homophobic" for the first time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Sopelsa | first=Brooke |  date=27 March 2017 | title=AP stylebook embraces 'they' as a singular, gender-neutral pronoun | url=https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/ap-stylebook-embraces-they-singular-gender-neutral-pronoun-n739076 | access-date=2023-10-22 | work=NBC News | language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; after having excluded it in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title=AP nixes 'homophobia', 'ethnic cleansing' | url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/11/ap-nixes-homophobia-ethnic-cleansing-150315.html | last=Byers | first=Dylan | magazine=[[Politico]] | date=26 November 2012 | access-date=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entry says the terms are "acceptable in broad references or in quotations to the concept of fear or hatred of gays, lesbians and bisexuals."

==== ''Heterophobia'' ====
&lt;!-- Heterophobia redirects here --&gt;
The term ''heterophobia'' is sometimes used to describe [[reverse discrimination]] towards heterosexuals.&lt;ref name="noonan1999" /&gt; The scientific use of ''heterophobia'' in [[sexology]] is restricted to a few researchers who question [[Alfred Kinsey]]'s sex research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Reisman | first1=Judith A. | last2=Eichel | first2=Edward W. | last3=Muir | first3=J. Gordon | last4=Court | first4=John Hugh | title=Kinsey, sex and fraud: The indoctrination of a people, an investigation into the human sexuality research of Alfred C. Kinsey, Wardell B. Pomeroy, Clyde E. Martin, and Paul H. Gebhard | date=1990 | publisher=Lochinvar-Huntington House | isbn=978-0-910311-20-5}}{{page needed|date=October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Dictionary of Sexuality'' by Robert T. Francoeur{{page needed|date=October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the existence or extent of heterophobia is mostly unrecognized by sexologists.&lt;ref name="noonan1999" /&gt; Beyond sexology, there is no consensus as to the meaning of the term because it is also used to mean "fear of the opposite", such as in [[Pierre-André Taguieff]]'s ''The Force of Prejudice: On Racism and Its Doubles'' (2001). Referring to the debate on both meaning and use, [[SUNY]] lecturer Raymond J. Noonan stated:&lt;ref name="noonan1999"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://home.bway.net/rjnoonan/Conf1999.html | title=Heterophobia: The evolution of an idea | first=Raymond J. | last=Noonan | date=6 November 1999 | publisher=Dr. Ray Noonan's 1999 Conference Presentations | access-date=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The term heterophobia is confusing for some people for several reasons. On the one hand, some look at it as just another of the many me-too social constructions that have arisen in the pseudoscience of victimology in recent decades. (Many of us recall John Money's 1995 criticism of the ascendancy of victimology and its negative impact on sexual science.) Others look at the parallelism between heterophobia and homophobia, and suggest that the former trivializes the latter... For others, it is merely a curiosity or parallel-construction word game. But for others still, it is part of both the recognition and politicization of heterosexuals' cultural interests in contrast to those of gays—particularly where those interests are perceived to clash.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stephen M. White and Louis R. Franzini introduced the related term ''heteronegativism'' to refer to the range of negative feelings that some gay individuals may hold toward heterosexuals. This term is preferred to ''heterophobia'' because it does not imply extreme or irrational fear.&lt;ref name="Franzini"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=White | first1=Stephen M. | last2=Franzini | first2=Louis R. | title=Heteronegativism: The attitudes of gay men and lesbians toward heterosexuals | journal=Journal of Homosexuality | date=24 February 1999 | volume=37 | issue=1 | pages=65–79 | doi=10.1300/J082v37n01_05 | pmid=10203070}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Merriam-Webster]] dictionary of the English language defines ''heterophobia'' as "irrational fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against heterosexual people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary | article-url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/heterophobia | article=heterophobia | dictionary=Merriam-Webster | edition=Online | access-date=15 March 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;
