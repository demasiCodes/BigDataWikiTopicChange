'''Homophobia''' is a range of negative [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s and feelings towards [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[queer]], and in some cases [[transgender]] and [[intersex]] people. Definitions refer variably to [[antipathy]], [[contempt]], [[prejudice]], aversion, and irrational [[fear]].&lt;ref name=Webster&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.webster.com/dictionary/homophobia|title=webster.com|accessdate=2008-01-29|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dictionary.com/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P6-TA-2006-0018&amp;format=XML&amp;language=EN "European Parliament resolution on homophobia in Europe"], Texts adopted Wednesday, 18 January 2006 – Strasbourg Final edition- "Homophobia in Europe" at "A" point&lt;/ref&gt; Homophobia is observable in critical and hostile behavior such as [[discrimination]]&lt;ref name="Webster"/&gt;&lt;ref name=dictionary.com&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/homophobia |title=homophobia|work=Dictonary.com|accessdate=2008-01-29|year=2008|publisher=Dictonary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Violence against LGBT people|violence]] on the basis of a perceived [[non-heterosexual]] [[Sexual orientation|orientation]]. In a 1998 address, author, activist, and civil rights leader [[Coretta Scott King]] stated that "Homophobia is like [[racism]] and [[anti-Semitism]] and other forms of [[bigotry]] in that it seeks to dehumanize a large group of people, to deny their humanity, their dignity and personhood."&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Defender, April 1, 1998, front page&lt;/ref&gt;

Among more discussed forms are ''institutionalized'' homophobia (e.g. religious and state-sponsored&lt;ref&gt;International Lesbian and Gay Association. [http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileID=1058&amp;FileCategory=10&amp;ZoneID=7 "State-sponsored Homophobia"]&lt;/ref&gt;), ''[[lesbophobia]]'' – the [[Intersectionality|intersection]] of homophobia and sexism directed against [[lesbian]]s, and ''internalized'' homophobia – a form of homophobia among people who experience [[same-sex attraction]] regardless of whether or not they [[Sexual orientation identity|identify]] as [[LGBT]].

Two words originate from ''[[wiktionary:homophobia|homophobia]]'': ''[[wiktionary:homophobic|homophobic]]'' (adj.) and ''[[wiktionary:homophobe|homophobe]]'' (n.), the latter word being a label for a person who displays homophobia or is thought to do so.

==Origins==
===Etymology===
The term ''homophobia'' was formed like the names for many other [[phobia]]s (e.g. ''chemophobia'') from a shortened version of what is feared, disliked, or discriminated against, in this case [[homosexual]]s, and the word ''phobia''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0384560#m_en_gb0384560 Oxford Dictionaries]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/homophobia American Heritage Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=homophobia&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

===First documented uses===

[[George Weinberg (psychologist)|George Weinberg]] is credited as the first person to have used the term in speech.&lt;ref name="herek"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herek|first=Gregory M.|year=2004|month=April|title=Beyond "Homophobia": Thinking About Sexual Prejudice and Stigma in the Twenty-First Century|journal=Sexuality Research &amp; Social Policy|volume=1|issue=2|pages=6–24|doi=10.1525/srsp.2004.1.2.6|accessdate=2009-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''homophobia'' first appeared in print in an article written for the May 23, 1969, edition of the American [[tabloid]] ''[[Screw magazine|Screw]]'', in which the word was used to refer to heterosexual men's fear that others might think they are gay.&lt;ref name="herek" /&gt;

Conceptualizing anti-LGBT prejudice as a [[social issues|social problem]] worthy of scholarly attention was not new.  In 1971, Kenneth Smith was the first person to use ''homophobia'' as a personality profile to describe the psychological aversion to homosexuality.&lt;ref name=Smith1971 &gt;{{Cite book|last=Smith |first=Kenneth T |year=1971 |title=Homophobia: a tentative personality profile |journal=Psychological Reports |pages=1091–4 |volume=29 |issue=3 |issn=00332941 |oclc=100640283 |pmid=5139344}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Weinberg (psychologist)|George Weinberg]], a [[Psychology|psychologist]], also used it this way in his 1972 book ''Society and the Healthy Homosexual'',&lt;ref name=Weinberg1972 &gt;{{Cite book|title=Society and the healthy homosexual |last=Weinberg |first=George |year=1973 |publisher=Garden City, New York Anchor Press Doubleday &amp; Co |isbn=9780385050838 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/434538701 |origyear=1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt; published one year before the [[American Psychiatric Association]] voted to remove homosexuality from its list of [[mental disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Recalling APA's Historic Step |url=http://www.psychiatricnews.org/pnews/00-09-01/recalling.html |first=Alfred M |last=Freedman |periodical=[[APA News]] |date=September 1, 2000 |accessdate=2010-08-21 |issn=00332704}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Macionis2005 &gt;{{Cite book|last1=Macionis |first1=John J. |year=2005 |title=Sociology: a global introduction |first2=Kenneth |last2=Plummer |edition=3 |publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=9780131287464 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=P4z3GgAgMFYC |page=332 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinberg's term became an important tool for gay and lesbian activists, advocates, and their allies.&lt;ref name="herek"/&gt; He describes the concept as a medical [[phobia]]:&lt;ref name=Weinberg1972/&gt;

{{quote|[A] phobia about homosexuals….It was a fear of homosexuals which seemed to be associated with a fear of contagion, a fear of reducing the things one fought for — home and family. It was a religious fear and it had led to great brutality as fear always does.&lt;ref name="herek" /&gt;}}

In 1982, ''homophobia'' was used for the first time in ''[[The New York Times]]'' to report that the [[General Synod of the Church of England]] voted to refuse to condemn homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=The Times|title=Homosexuality best seen as a handicap, Dr Runcie says|date=February 28, 1981|author=Clifford Longley|quote=Let us recognize where the problem lies – in the dislike and distaste felt by many heterosexuals for homosexuals, a problem we have come to call ''homophobia''.|url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1981-02-28-02-008&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1981-02-28-02 | location=London}} and {{Cite news|title=New light on Archbishop of Canterbury's view on homosexuality |last=Gledhill |first=Ruth |date=August 7, 2008 |newspaper=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article4474226.ece | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of meaning and purpose==
===Distinctions and proposed alternatives===
Researchers have proposed alternative terms to describe prejudice and discrimination against [[LGBT]] people. Some of these alternatives show more [[Transparency (linguistic)#Descriptive|semantic transparency]] while others do not include -''[[phobia]]'':

*''Homoerotophobia'', being a possible precursor term to ''homophobia'', was coined by [[Wainwright Churchill]] and documented in ''Homosexual Behavior Among Males'' in 1967.

*The specious etymology of ''homophobia'' citing the union of ''homos'' and ''phobos'' is the basis for [[LGBT history|LGBT historian]] Boswell's criticism of the term and for his suggestion of the alternative ''homosexophobia''.&lt;ref name = BOS1980&gt;{{Cite book|title=Christianity, social tolerance, and homosexuality: Gay people in Western Europe from the beginning of the Christian era to the fourteenth century |first=John |last=Boswell |publisher=Chicago: University of Chicago Press |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Homonegativity]]'' is based on the term ''homonegativism'' used by Hudson and Ricketts in a 1980 paper; they coined the term for their research in order to avoid ''homophobia'', which they regarded as being unscientific in its presumption of motivation.&lt;ref name=Hudson1980 &gt;{{Cite book|title=A strategy for the measurement of homophobia. |last=Hudson |first=WW |last2=Ricketts |first2=WA |journal=[[Journal of Homosexuality]] |pages=357–72 |volume=5 |issue=4 |year=1980 |issn=00918369 |oclc=115532547 |doi=10.1300/J082v05n04_02 |pmid=7204951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Heterosexism]]'' refers to a system of negative attitudes, bias, and discrimination in favor of opposite-sex sexual orientation and relationships.&lt;ref name="JungSmith"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jung|first=Patricia Beattie|coauthors=Smith, Ralph F.|title=Heterosexism: An Ethical Challenge|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1993|isbn=0791416968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;13&lt;/sup&gt; It can include the presumption that everyone is heterosexual or that opposite-sex attractions and relationships are the only [[norm (sociology)|norm]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.granddictionnaire.com/btml/fra/r_motclef/index800_1.asp |title=Avis au public |publisher=Granddictionnaire.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore superior.

*''Sexual prejudice'' – Researcher at the [[University of California, Davis]] [[Gregory M. Herek]] preferred ''sexual prejudice'' as being descriptive, free of presumptions about motivations, and lacking value judgments as to the irrationality or immorality of those so labeled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Herek GM |title=The context of [[anti-gay]] violence: Notes on cultural and psychological heterosexism |journal=J Interpers Violence |volume=5 |pages=316–33 |year=1990 |doi=10.1177/088626090005003006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herek |first=Gregory M. |title=The psychology of sexual prejudice |journal=Curr Dir Psychol Sci |volume=9 |url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/Current_Directions_preprint.pdf |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He compared ''homophobia'', ''heterosexism'', and ''sexual prejudice'', and, in preferring the third term, noted that ''homophobia'' was "probably more widely used and more often criticized." He also observed that "Its critics note that homophobia implicitly suggests that antigay attitudes are best understood as an irrational fear and that they represent a form of individual [[psychopathology]] rather than a socially reinforced prejudice."

===Opposition===

Use of ''homophobia'', ''homophobic'', and ''homophobe'' has been criticized as [[pejorative]] against those with differing value positions.
*In 1993, [[behavioral science|behavioral scientists]] [[William O'Donohue]] and Christine Caselles concluded that the usage of the term "as it is usually used, makes an illegitimately pejorative evaluation of certain open and debatable value positions, much like the former disease construct of homosexuality" itself, arguing that the term may be used as an ''[[ad hominem]]'' argument against those who advocate values or positions of which the speaker does not approve. The [[social construct]] of [[masculinity]] is not defined by attraction to females alone but also by negative attraction to males. The implication of a fear of something unmasculine, given the term's scientific etymology, may be used illegitimately to imply that anyone with a different opinion is unmasculine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=William |last1=O'Donohue |first2=Christine |last2=Caselles |title=Homophobia: Conceptual, definitional, and value issues |journal=J Psychopathol Behav Assess |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages= |month=September |year=1993 |doi= |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n0264m864t146585/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A group of psychologists from the University of Arkansas conducted research that showed that participants responses were not fear-based but reflected a disapproval of homosexuality that was due to other factors, such as "disgust".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailyheadlines.uark.edu/3240.htm University of Arkansas, Daily Headlines: "Disgust not fear drives homophobia, say UA psychologists" (June 07 2002)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[National Association for Research &amp; Therapy of Homosexuality]], an organization affiliated with the [[ex-gay]] movement, describes the term homophobia as being "often used inaccurately to describe any person who objects to homosexual behavior on either moral, psychological or medical grounds." They claim that, "Technically, however, the terms actually denotes a person who has a phobia — or irrational fear — of homosexuality. Principled disagreement, therefore, cannot be labeled 'homophobia.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.narth.com/menus/positionstatements.html NARTH Position Statements], [[National Association for Research &amp; Therapy of Homosexuality]], 27 February 2008 .

== Classification ==

Homophobia manifests in different forms, and a number of different types have been postulated, among which are internalized homophobia, social homophobia, emotional homophobia, rationalized homophobia, and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060904125724/http://allies.tamu.edu/Did+You+Know/riddle.htm The Riddle Homophobia Scale] from Allies Committee website, Department of Student Life, Texas A&amp;M University&lt;/ref&gt; There were also ideas to classify homophobia, racism, and sexism as an ''intolerant [[personality disorder]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Guindon MH, Green AG, Hanna FJ |title=Intolerance and Psychopathology: Toward a General Diagnosis for Racism, Sexism, and Homophobia |journal=Am J Orthopsychiatry |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=167–76 |year=2003 |month=April |pmid=12769238 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/ort/73/2/167 |doi=10.1037/0002-9432.73.2.167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homophobia has never been listed as part of a clinical taxonomy of phobias, neither in [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] or [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|ICD]]; homophobia is usually used in a non-clinical sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Paula A. |last=Treichler |title=AIDS, Homophobia, and Biomedical Discourse: An Epidemic of Signification |journal=AIDS: Cultural Analysis/Cultural Activism |volume=43 |pages=31–70 |issue=Winter |month=October |year=1987 |oclc=17873405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutionalized homophobia===
====Religious homophobia====

{{Main|Religion and homosexuality}}

Several world religions contain anti-homosexual teachings, while other religions have varying degrees of ambivalence, neutrality, or incorporate teachings regarding homosexuals as [[third gender]]. Even within some religions which generally discourage homosexuality, there are also people who view homosexuality positively, and some [[religious denomination]]s may go so far as to bless [[same-sex marriages]]. There also exist so-called [[Queer religion]]s, dedicated to serving the spiritual needs of [[LGBTQI]] persons. [[Queer theology]] seeks to provide a counter-point to religious homophobia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mccchurch.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Resources&amp;Template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=614#queerspirit Queer Spirituality].&lt;/ref&gt;

====State-sponsored homophobia====

State-sponsored homophobia includes the criminalization and penalization of homosexuality, hate speech from government figures, and other forms of discrimination, violence, persecution of LGBT people.

=====Past regimes=====

{{Main|LGBT rights in China|LGBT rights in Russia}}
{{See also|History of homosexual people in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust}}

In China homosexual behavior was outlawed in 1740.  When [[Mao]] came to power, the government thought of homosexuality as "social disgrace or a form of mental illness", and "[d]uring the [[cultural revolution]] (1966–76), people who were homosexual faced their worst period of persecution in Chinese history." Despite there being no law in the [[communist]] People's Republic against homosexuality, "police regularly rounded up gays and lesbians." Other laws were used to prosecute homosexual people and they were "charged with hooliganism or disturbing public order."&lt;ref&gt;"History of Chinese homosexuality" (2004-04-01) ''Shanghai Star'' Accessed July 3, 2009. [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-04/01/content_319807.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soviet Union]] under [[Vladimir Lenin]] decriminalized homosexuality in 1922, long before many other European countries. The [[Communist Party of Russia|Russian Communist Party]] effectively legalized no-fault divorce, abortion and homosexuality, when they abolished all the old [[Russian Empire|Tsarist]] laws and the initial Soviet criminal code kept these liberal sexual policies in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unity and diversity in socialist law |last=Hazard |first=John N |author2=Columbia University. Russian Institute |year=1965 |publisher=[New York] Russian Institute, School of International Affairs, Columbia University |oclc=80991633 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some left-wing figures have considered homosexuality a "[[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] disease", a right-wing movement or a "Western disease".&lt;ref name="left"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gay men and the sexual history of the political left |last=Hekma |first=Gert |last2=Oosterhuis |first2=Harry |last3=Steakley |first3=James D |year=1995 |publisher=Harrington Park Press |isbn=9781560230670 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32923590 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lenin's emancipation was reversed a decade later by [[Joseph Stalin]] and homosexuality remained illegal under Article 121 until the [[Boris Yeltsin|Yeltsin]] era.

The [[North Korea]]n government condemns Western [[gay culture]] as a vice caused by the decadence of [[capitalism|capitalist society]], and denounces it as promoting [[consumerism]], [[classism]], and promiscuity.&lt;ref&gt;Global Gayz.

Homosexuals in the DPRK have never been subject to repression, as in many capitalist regimes around the world."

[[Robert Mugabe]], the leader of [[Zimbabwe]], has waged a violent [[LGBT rights in Zimbabwe|campaign against people who are homosexual]], arguing that before colonisation, Zimbabweans did not engage in homosexual acts.&lt;ref name="HOMO"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of sex and gender : men and women in the world's cultures |last=Ember |first=Carol R |last2=Ember |first2=Melvin |year=2004 |publisher=Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers |isbn=9780306477706 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/54914021 |page=213 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His first major public condemnation of homosexuality was in August 1995, during the Zimbabwe International Book Fair.&lt;ref name="ZIB"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hungochani : the history of a dissident sexuality in southern Africa |last=Epprecht |first=Marc |year=2004 |publisher=Montreal |isbn=9780773527515 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/54905608 |page=180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He told an audience: "If you see people parading themselves as lesbians and gays, arrest them and hand them over to the police!"&lt;ref name="GAYRANT"&gt;[http://www.kaiwright.com/gayzimbabwe_more.php?id=101_0_25_0_M Under African Skies, Part I: 'Totally unacceptable to cultural norms'] Kaiwright.com&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 1995, Zimbabwe's parliament introduced legislation banning homosexual acts.&lt;ref name="ZIB"/&gt; In 1997, a court found [[Canaan Banana]], Mugabe's predecessor and the first President of Zimbabwe, guilty of 11 counts of sodomy and [[indecent assault]].&lt;ref name="BANANAtrial"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Veit-Wild |first1=Flora |year=2005 |title=Body, sexuality, and gender |first2=Dirk |last2=Naguschewski |publisher=Rodopi |isbn=9789042016262 |url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN9042016264 |page=93 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bananadeath"&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/zimbabwe/article/0,2763,1082496,00.html Canaan Banana, president jailed in sex scandal, dies] ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Overlapping homophobias====
In some cases, the distinction between religious homophobia and state-sponsored homophobia is not clear, a key example being territories under [[Islamic]] authority. All major [[Islamic sects]] [[Homosexuality and Islam|forbid homosexuality]], which is a crime under [[Sharia Law]] and treated as such in most [[Muslim]] coutries. In [[Afghanistan]], for instance, homosexuality carried the death penalty under the [[Taliban]]. After their fall, homosexuality went from a capital crime to one punished with fines and prison sentences. The legal situation in the [[United Arab Emirates]], however, is unclear.

In 2009, [[ILGA]] published a report entitled ''State Sponsored Homophobia 2009'',&lt;ref name="ilga.org"&gt;[http://www.ilga.org/http://www.ilga.org/statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2009.pdf ILGA: 2009 Report on State Sponsored Homophobia (2009)]{{Dead link|date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on research carried out by Daniel Ottosson at Södertörn University College, Stockholm, Sweden.  This research found that of the 80 countries around the world that continue to consider homosexuality illegal:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileID=1111&amp;ZoneID=7&amp;FileCategory=50 ILGA:7 countries still put people to death for same-sex acts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="religionfacts.com"&gt;[http://www.religionfacts.com/homosexuality/islam.htm Homosexuality and Islam – ReligionFacts]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internalized homophobia ===
{{main|Ego-dystonic sexual orientation}}
Internalized homophobia (or [[egodystonic]] homophobia) refers to negative feeling towards oneself because of homosexuality.&lt;ref name=apa /&gt;&lt;ref name=Herek1998 &gt;{{Cite book|last=Herek |first=G M |year=1998 |title=Correlates of Internalized Homophobia in a Community Sample of Lesbians and Gay Men |last2=Cogan |first2=J C |last3=Gillis |first3=J R |last4=Glunt |first4=E K |journal=J Gay Lesbian Med Assoc |pages=17–26 |volume=2 |issue=1 |issn=10907173 |oclc=206392016 |url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/JGLMApre.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term has been criticized because holding negative attitudes does not necessarily involve a phobia, and the term "internalized stigma" is sometimes used instead.&lt;ref name=apa&gt;[http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/therapeutic-response.pdf Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation]&lt;/ref&gt; It causes severe discomfort with or disapproval of one's own [[sexual orientation]].

Such a situation may cause extreme repression of homosexual desires.&lt;ref name=Adams96/&gt; In other cases, a conscious internal struggle may occur for some time, often pitting deeply held religious or social beliefs against strong sexual and emotional desires. This discordance often causes [[clinical depression]], and the unusually high [[suicide]] rate among gay teenagers (up to 30 percent of non-heterosexual youth attempt suicide) has been attributed to this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://66.151.111.132/pp2/portal/files/portal/medicalinfo/sexualhealth/article-sexual-orientation.xml Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity — Discrimination and Conflicts]{{Dead link|date=May 2009}} from [[Planned Parenthood]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Psychotherapy, such as [[gay affirmative psychotherapy]], and participation in a sexual-minority affirming group can help resolve the internal conflict between a religious and a sexual identity.&lt;ref name=apa /&gt;

The label of internalized homophobia is sometimes applied to conscious or unconscious behaviors which an observer feels the need to promote or conform to the expectations of [[heteronormativity]] or heterosexism. This can include extreme repression and denial coupled with forced outward displays of heteronormative behavior for the purpose of appearing or attempting to feel "normal" or "accepted". This might also include less overt behavior like making assumptions about the gender of a person's romantic partner, or about [[gender role]]s. Some also apply this label to [[LGBT]] persons who support "compromise" policies, such as those that find [[civil union]]s an acceptable alternative to [[same-sex marriage]].

Some argue that some or most people who are homophobic have repressed their own homosexuality. In 1996, a controlled study of 64 heterosexual men (half claimed to be homophobic by experience and self-reported orientation) at the [[University of Georgia]] found that men who were found to be homophobic (as measured by the Index of Homophobia)&lt;ref&gt;Index of Homophobia: W. W. Hudson and W. A. Ricketts, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; were considerably more likely to experience more [[erection|erectile]] responses when exposed to [[homoerotic]] images than non-homophobic men.&lt;ref name=Adams96&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Adams HE, Wright LW, Lohr BA |title=Is homophobia associated with homosexual arousal? |journal=J Abnorm Psychol |volume=105 |issue=3 |pages=440–5 |year=1996 |month=August |pmid=8772014 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/abn/105/3/440 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.105.3.440}} Summarized in an [[American Psychological Association]] press release, August 1996: "[http://web.archive.org/web/20040202035152/www.apa.org/releases/homophob.html New Study Links Homophobia with Homosexual Arousal]".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social homophobia ===

The word can be used to describe the fear of a [[heterosexual]] that they will be approached romantically by someone of the same sex.

The fear of being identified as gay can be considered as a form of social homophobia. Theorists including [[Calvin Thomas (critical theorist)|Calvin Thomas]] and [[Judith Butler]] have suggested that homophobia can be rooted in an individual's fear of being identified as gay. Homophobia in men is correlated with insecurity about masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/health/050802_masculinity.html Masculinity Challenged, Men Prefer War and SUVs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/hiphop/gender.htm|title=Homophobia and Hip-Hop|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, allegedly homophobia is rampant in sports, and in the [[subculture]] of its supporters, that are considered [[stereotype|stereotypically]] ''"male"'', like [[football]] ([[Rugby football|rugby]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/sports/34787/fans-culture-hard-to-change "Fans' culture hard to change"]&lt;/ref&gt;

These theorists have argued that a person who expresses homophobic thoughts and feelings does so not only to communicate their beliefs about the class of gay people, but also to distance themselves from this class and its social status. Thus, by distancing themselves from gay people, they are reaffirming their role as a heterosexual in a [[heteronormative]] culture, thereby attempting to prevent themselves from being labeled and treated as a gay person.  This interpretation alludes to the idea that a person may posit violent opposition to "the Other" as a means of establishing their own identity as part of the majority and thus gaining social validation.

Nancy J. Chodorow states that homophobia can be viewed as a method of protection of male masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy J. Chodorow. [http://www.cyberpsych.org/homophobia/chodorow.htm Statement in a public forum on homophobia by The American Psychoanalytic Foundation, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theories explain homophobia as a threat to an individual's own same-sex impulses, whether those impulses are imminent or merely hypothetical. This threat causes repression, denial or [[reaction formation]].&lt;ref&gt;West, D.J. ''Homosexuality re-examined.'' Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1977. ISBN 0816608121&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexist beliefs ===

Some [[gender theorist]]s interpret the fact that male-to-male relationships often incite a stronger reaction in homophobic people than female-to-female ([[lesbian]]) as meaning that people who are homophobic feel more threatened by the perceived subversion of the male-superior [[gender paradigm]]. According to such theorists as [[D. A. Miller]], male heterosexuality is defined not only by the desire for women but also (and more importantly) by the denial of desire for men. Therefore, expressions of homophobia serve as a means of accenting their male nature by distancing themselves from the threatening concept of their own potential femininity, and consequently belittling gay men, as not being ''real'' males. According to this theory, the reason male homosexuality is treated worse compared to female homosexuality is [[sexist]] in its underlying belief that men are superior to women and therefore for a man to ''"replace"'' a woman during intercourse with another man necessarily degrades his own masculine status.

Miller's view implies that only the receptive or submissive role in a homosexual act is regarded as [[emasculation|emasculating]], as is the case in many cultures. His specific claim that male heterosexuality does not require a "desire for women" seems to preclude the possibility of [[asexuality]] or [[bisexuality]]. It is not made clear why heterosexual men would "need" to fear gay people in order to affirm maleness{{ndash}} unless they perceived that their sexuality was already threatened by another factor.

Other theories of the difference in homophobic reactions to male-male rather than female-female homosexual relationships simply have to do with a common sexual desire. A heterosexual man desires women. For a woman to desire women is thus more understandable than for a man to desire men, as a heterosexual man and homosexual woman share the same desire for women, but a heterosexual man cannot understand or identify with the attraction of one man to another man. Similarly, homosexual men desire men, and thus for a man to desire men is understandable to a woman who has the same desires.

=== Distribution of attitudes in the UK and US===

Disapproval of homosexuality and of gay people &lt;!-- I assume? What specific behaviors or beliefs were being measured by the study cited below? --&gt; is not evenly distributed throughout society, but is more or less pronounced according to age, ethnicity, geographic location, race, sex, [[social class]], education, partisan identification and religious status. According to UK [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] charity [[AVERT]], lack of homosexual feelings or experiences, religious views, and lack of interaction with gay people are strongly associated with such views.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avert.org/hsexu3.htm Prejudice &amp; Attitudes to Gay Men &amp; Lesbians]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, attitudes about people who are homosexual may vary on the basis of partisan identification. [[U.S. Republican Party|Republicans]] are far more likely than [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democrats]] to have negative attitudes about people who are gay and lesbian, according to surveys conducted by the [[National Election Studies]] in 2000 through 2004.

Homophobia also varies by region, statistics show that the [[Southern United States]] has more reports of anti-gay prejudice than any other region in the US.&lt;ref name=APCJ2005&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons|first=P.

In some cases, the works of authors who merely have the word "Gay" in their name ([[Gay Talese]], [[Peter Gay]]) or works about things also contain the name (''[[Enola Gay]]'') have been destroyed because of a perceived pro-homosexual bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Petras|first1=Kathryn|last2=Petras|first2=Ross|title=Unusually Stupid Americans (A compendium of all American Stupidity)|year=2003|publisher=Villard Books|location=New York|isbn=0-9658068-7-1|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disparity is shown in the graph on the right, which is from a book published in 2008 by Joseph Fried. It should be noted that the tendency of Republicans to view gay and lesbian people negatively could be based on homophobia, religious beliefs, or [[conservatism]] with respect to the traditional family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Democrats and Republicans—rhetoric and reality : comparing the voters in statistics and anecdotes |last=Fried |first=Joseph |year=2008 |publisher=Algora Pub |isbn=0875866050 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/183179592 |page=185 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study of white adolescent males conducted at the [[University of Cincinnati]] by Janet Baker has been used to argue that negative feelings towards gay people are also associated with other [[discriminatory]] behaviors. The study claims to have found that hatred of gay people, [[anti-Semitism]] and [[racism]] are "likely companions",&lt;ref&gt;"[http://calbears.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n10_v85/ai_14936859 Homophobia, racism likely companions, study shows]," ''Jet'', January 10, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting it is an abuse of power. A study performed in 2007 in the [[UK]] for the charity Stonewall reports that 90 percent of the population support [[Civil rights|anti-discrimination laws]] protecting gay and lesbian people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/gayrights/story/0,,2086335,00.html |title=Majority support gay equality rights, poll finds|date=May 23, 2007|publisher=Guardian | location=London | first=Hugh | last=Muir | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social constructs and culture can perpetuate homophobic attitudes. Such cultural sources in the [[black community]] include:

Professional [[sports]] in many countries involves homophobic expressions by star athletes and by fans. Incidents in the United States have included:
* Hockey fans

Most international [[human rights]] organizations, such as [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]], condemn laws that make homosexual relations between consenting adults a crime.  Since 1994,  the [[United Nations]] [[Human Rights Committee]] has also ruled that such laws violated the right to privacy guaranteed in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].  In 2008, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] issued a statement which "urges States to do away with criminal penalties against [homosexual persons]." The statement, however, was addressed to reject a resolution by the UN Assembly that would have precisely called for an end of penalties against homosexuals in the world.&lt;ref name="vatican.va"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/2008/documents/rc_seg-st_20081218_statement-sexual-orientation_en.html STATEMENT OF THE HOLY SEE DELEGATION AT THE 63rd SESSION OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE UNITED NATIONS ON THE DECLARATION ON HUMAN RIGHTS, SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY (18 DECEMBER 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted a recommendation on measures to combat discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity, described by CoE Secretary General as the first legal instrument in the world dealing specifically with one of the most long-lasting and difficult forms of discrimination to combat.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=PR277(2010)&amp;Language=lanEnglish&amp;Ver=original&amp;Site=DC&amp;BackColorInternet=F5CA75&amp;BackColorIntranet=F5CA75&amp;BackColorLogged=A9BACE]&lt;/ref&gt;

To combat homophobia, the LGBT community uses events such as [[gay pride parade]]s and [[political activism]] (''See [[gay pride]]).'' This is criticized by some{{Who|date=July 2009}} as counter-productive though, as gay pride parades showcase what could be seen as more "extreme" sexuality: fetish-based and gender-variant aspects of LGBT culture. One form of organized resistance to homophobia is the [[International Day Against Homophobia]] (or IDAHO),&lt;ref&gt;"[http://ilga.org/news_results_b.asp?FileID=329 Towards an international Day against Homophobia]", April 10, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; first celebrated May 17, 2005 in related activities in more than 40 countries.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.emediawire.com/releases/2005/5/emw239185.htm 1st Annual International Day Against Homophobia to be Celebrated in over 40 Countries on May 17]", May 12, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The four largest countries of Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Colombia) developed mass media campaigns against homophobia since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;"{{Cite web|publisher=Pan American Health Organization|title=Campaigns against Homophobia in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico	|url=http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=346&amp;Itemid=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to public expression, legislation has been designed, controversially, to oppose homophobia, as in [[hate speech]], [[hate crime]], and laws against [[discrimination]] on the basis of sexual orientation.

Successful preventative strategies against homophobic prejudice and bullying in schools have included teaching pupils about historical figures who were gay, or who suffered discrimination because of their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/oct/26/gay-history-lessons-bullying-schools |title=Lessons on gay history cut homophobic bullying in north London school |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=26 October 2010 |accessdate=09 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that anti-LGBT prejudice is immoral and goes above and beyond the effects on that class of people. Warren J. Blumenfeld argues that this emotion gains a dimension beyond itself, as a tool for extreme right-wing conservatives and fundamentalist religious groups and as a restricting factor on gender-relations as to the weight associated with performing each role accordingly.&lt;ref name=Blumenfeld1992 &gt;{{Cite book|title=Homophobia : how we all pay the price |last=Blumenfeld |first=Warren J |year=1992 |publisher=Beacon Press |isbn=9780807079195 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/24544734}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Blumenfeld in particular claimed:
