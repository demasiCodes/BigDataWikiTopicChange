It was renamed in 2002 as the '''Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act''', in honor of its principal author [[Patsy T. Mink|Congresswoman Mink]], but is most commonly known simply as '''Title IX'''. The law states that

{{quote|text=No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance...|sign=United States Code Section 20|source=&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|20|1681}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although Title IX is best known for its impact on high school and [[college athletics|collegiate athletics]], the original statute made no explicit mention of sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carpenter, Linda Jean|author2=Acosta, R.

==History==
{{Cleanup|section|date=November 2009}} 
{{Wikify|section|date=November 2009}}
Although the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was originally written in order to end discrimination based on color, the act tremendously helped to energize the Women’s Rights movement of the 1970s which had somewhat slowed after women’s suffrage in 1920.&lt;ref name="Suggs"&gt;Suggs, Welsh. ''A Place on the Team.'' Princeton, NJ.: Princeton University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Title VI of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] says that any institution receiving federal funding may not discriminate against anyone based on gender. This act was passed in [[1971]] as a result of combining acts VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act. Title VI states that, “No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.&lt;ref name="Suggs"/&gt;  Title VII forbids discrimination in hiring and employment based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin.&lt;ref name="Suggs"/&gt; In the context of Title IX and women’s rights it is important to note that Title VI includes no mention of gender bias whereas Title VII does.

After signing the Civil Rights act a few years earlier, in 1967, President Johnson issued a series of executive orders in order to make some clarifications. Before these clarifications were made, the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) persuaded President Johnson to include women in his executive orders.&lt;ref name="Suggs"/&gt; The most notable order was Order 11246 which required all entities receiving federal contracts to end discrimination in hiring.  
In 1969, emerging activist Bernice Sandler used the executive order to help her fight for her job at the University of Maryland.&lt;ref name="Valentin"&gt;Valentin, Iram. “Title IX: A Brief History.” Women’s Equity Resource Center. August 	1997. http://www2.edc.org/WomensEquity/pdffiles/t9digest.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; She used university statistics showing how female employment at the university had plummeted as qualified women were replaced by men.&lt;ref name="Suggs"/&gt; Sandler brought her grievance to the Department of Labor’s Office for Federal Fair Contracts Compliance where she was encouraged to file a formal complaint. Citing inequalities in pay, rank, admissions and much more, Sandler began to file complaints not only against the University of Maryland but numerous other colleges as well. Working in conjunction with NOW and [[Women's Equity Action League]] (WEAL), Sandler filed 250 complaints against colleges and universities.&lt;ref name="Suggs"/&gt; 

In 1970, Sandler joined Representative Edith Green’s Subcommittee on Higher Education and sat in on the congressional hearings where women’s rights were discussed. It was in the congressional hearings that Green and Sandler first proposed Title IX. Title IX was drafted and introduced by Congresswoman Patsy T. Mink, with the assistance of Congresswoman Green.&lt;ref name="aauw"&gt;“Title IX: A Brief History.” AAUW. 2009. http://www.aauw.org/advocacy/laf/lafnetwork/library/AthleticsHistory.cfm.&lt;/ref&gt; In the hearing there was very little mention of athletics.&lt;ref name="Suggs"/&gt; Their focus was more specifically on the hiring and employment practices of federally financed institutions. The proposed Title IX created much buzz and gained a lot of support.  Title IX was passed into law on June 23, 1972.&lt;ref name="now"&gt;“Legislative History of Title IX”  National Organization for Women. June 27, 2007. http://www.now.org/issues/title_ix/history.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The wording of Title IX is very brief so specific language and clarifications on the implementation were very important. President Nixon charged the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) with this important task.&lt;ref name="Suggs"/&gt; It wasn’t until this step that everyone truly understood the ramifications of Title IX as it would apply to college athletics. 

Worried about how this would affect men’s athletics, many people became concerned and looked for ways to limit the influence of Title IX. One such attempt was by Senator John Tower who introduced an amendment to exempt revenue producing sports from Title IX compliance.&lt;ref name="cases"&gt;“Landmark Title IX Cases in History” Gender Equity in Sport. February 23, 2006. http://bailiwick.lib.uiowa.edu/ge/historyRE.html
.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that year the Tower amendment was rejected and the Javits amendment was put in its place. The Javits amendment, proposed by Senator Jacob Javits, stated that the HEW must include “reasonable provisions considering the nature of particular sports.&lt;ref name="Suggs"/&gt;” 

In June 1975, HEW published the final regulations as to how Title IX would be enforced.&lt;ref name="Suggs"/&gt; The regulations specify things like how many female athletes a college needs to have, which sports to offer, and the level of competition each is expected to have.&lt;ref name="now"/&gt; The regulations do qualify that the budgets of men's and women's sports do not have to be equal but should be comparable.&lt;ref name="Suggs"/&gt; Universities were given 3 years to comply with these standards.&lt;ref name="now"/&gt; 

The NCAA and many universities were not happy about the decisions made by the HEW. The NCAA tried unsuccessfully to claim that the implementation of Title IX was illegal. A revised Tower amendment was proposed and many debates were had but Title IX stood.&lt;ref name="Suggs"/&gt; A few years later, in 1979, the HEW issued further clarifications which broke down compliance into three sections.&lt;ref name="cases"/&gt; This became known as the three-pronged test for compliance. The three prong test has been highly controversial throughout its conception. In 1980 the Department of Education (DOE) was established and given oversight over title IX through the Office for Civil Rights.&lt;ref name="cases"/&gt;

==Applicability and compliance==
The legislation covers all educational activities, and complaints under Title IX alleging [[sex discrimination]] in fields such as [[science]] or [[math education]], or in other aspects of academic life such as access to [[health care]] and [[dormitory]] facilities, are not unheard of. It also applies to non-sport activities such as [[school band]] and clubs; however, [[fraternities and sororities|social fraternities and sororities]], sex-specific youth clubs such as [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts]] and [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], and [[Boys State|Girls State and Boys State]] are specifically exempt from Title IX requirements.

Title IX is administered by the Office for Civil Rights in the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] (OCR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/om/fs_po/ocr/dels.html|title=US Department of Education Principal Office Functional Statements: Office for Civil Rights|accessdate=2009-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It applies to an entire school or institution if any part of that school receives federal funds; hence, athletic programs are subject to Title IX, even though there is very little direct federal funding of school sports.&lt;ref&gt;34 C.F.R. §106.2&lt;/ref&gt; The regulations implementing Title IX require all universities receiving federal funds to perform self-evaluations of whether they offer equal opportunities based on sex&lt;ref&gt;34 C.F.R. §106.3&lt;/ref&gt; and to provide written assurances to the Dept. of Education that the institution is in compliance for the period that the federally funded equipment or facilities remain in use.&lt;ref&gt;34 C.F.R. §106.4&lt;/ref&gt; 

With respect to athletic programs, the Dept. of Education evaluates the following factors in determining whether equal treatment exists:&lt;ref&gt;34 C.F.R. §106.41(e)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(1) Whether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes

(2) The provision of equipment and supplies;

(3) Scheduling of games and practice time;

(4) Travel and per diem allowance;

(5) Opportunity to receive coaching and academic tutoring on mathematics only;

(6) Assignment and compensation of coaches and tutors;

(7) Provision of locker rooms, practice and competitive facilities;

(8) Provision of medical and training facilities and services;

(9) Provision of housing and dining facilities and services;

(10) Publicity.

Unequal aggregate expenditures for members of each sex or unequal expenditures for male and female teams if a recipient operates or sponsors separate teams will not constitute noncompliance with this section, but the Assistant Secretary [of Education for Civil Rights] may consider the failure to provide necessary funds for teams for one sex in assessing equality of opportunity for members of each sex.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On November 24, 2006, the Department of Education OCR regulations were amended to provide greater flexibility in the operation of single-sex classes or extracurricular activities at the primary or secondary school level.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/finrule/2006-4/102506a.html Retrieved 2008-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Three-prong test of compliance===
In 1979, the U.S. [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] under Jimmy Carter's administration issued a policy interpretation for Title IX, including what has become known as the "three-prong test" of an institution's compliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/t9interp.html Title IX 1979 Policy Interpretation on Intercollegiate Athletics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IX:http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1568/is_10_31/ai_59580155&lt;/ref&gt;
#Prong one - Providing athletic participation opportunities that are substantially proportionate to the student enrollment, OR
#Prong two - Demonstrate a continual expansion of athletic opportunities for the underrepresented sex, OR
#Prong three - Full and effective accommodation of the interest and ability of underrepresented sex.

A recipient of federal funds can demonstrate compliance with Title IX by meeting any one of the three prongs.&lt;ref name=OCRletter&gt;http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/title9guidanceadditional.html Retrieved 2008-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 17, 2005, OCR announced a clarification of prong three of the three-part test of Title IX compliance. The guidance concerned the use of web-based surveys to determine the level of interest in varsity athletics among the under-represented sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Additional Clarification of Intercollegiate Athletics Policy: Three-Part Test ― Part Three | url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/title9guidanceadditional.html | published= [[U.S. Department of Education]]| accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 20, 2010, The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights blew up the 2005 clarification that allowed institutions to use only Internet or e-mail surveys to meet the interests and abilities (third prong) option of the three-part test for Title IX compliance.  Opponents of the clarification – including the NCAA Executive Committee, which issued a resolution soon afterward asking Association members not to use the survey – claimed the survey was flawed in part because of the way it counted non-responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=OCR rescinds 2005 Title IX clarification | url=http://www.ncaa.org/wps/portal/ncaahome?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/ncaa/ncaa/ncaa+news/ncaa+news+online/2010/association-wide/ocr+rescinds+2005+title+ix+clarification_04_20_10_ncaa_news | published= [[N.C.A.A.]]| accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementation and litigation===
{{Cleanup|section|date=September 2009}}

Grove City vs. Bell: A 1984 lawsuit brought by Grove City College against the Department of Education. Grove City, in an effort to remain out of the jurisdiction of Title IX refused state and federal financial assistance.&lt;ref name="oyez"&gt;[http://oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1983/1983_82_792 ”The Oyez Project, Grove City College v. Bell”] , 465 U.S. 555 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; However, they did accept students who were receiving Basic Educational Opportunity Grants through a Department of Education program .&lt;ref name="oyez"/&gt; The DOE ruled that because some of its students were receiving the grants the school was receiving federal assistance and was required to comply with Title IX standards. The school did not agree with the DOE’s ruling and brought their case to the Supreme Court. The Court decided that Title IX applied only to those programs receiving direct financial aid.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/597287/Title-IX "Title IX."] Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 19 Nov. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Since Grove City was only receiving assistance in the financial aid program, only that program had to be in compliance. 

The ruling in the Grove City case was a huge victory for those opposed to Title IX.  This made many institutions' sports programs outside of the rule of Title IX. The Grove City vs. Bell ruling reduced the scope of Title IX.&lt;ref name="Suggs"/&gt; The ruling, however, was short lived. The Civil Rights Restoration Act was passed in 1988 which restored Title IX coverage to all of an educational institution’s programs if the institution receives any federal assistance, whether direct or indirect.&lt;ref name="now"/&gt; 

The last major piece of Title IX legislation was the passing of the Equity in Athletics Disclosure act of 1994. The act, sponsored by Illinois congresswoman, Cardiss Collins, required federally-assisted higher education institutions to disclose information on roster sizes for men’s and women’s teams, as well as budgets for recruiting, scholarships, coaches’ salaries, and other expenses, annually.&lt;ref name="cases"/&gt; This allowed for much better monitoring of Title IX compliance.

Since Title IX was passed into law there have been many court cases claiming non-compliance. One of the most notable cases is Franklin vs. Gwinnett County, brought to court in 1992. The decision in this case required that punitive damages should be awarded to plaintiffs when Title IX is intentionally avoided.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; In addition, one year later in the Favia vs Indiana University of Pennsylvania the court of appeals ruled that financial difficulties is not an excuse for non-compliance.&lt;ref name="cases"/&gt;

In one specific instance, Title IX was instrumental in a court case involving [[Louisiana State University]]. In 1996, a federal court referenced Title IX in ruling that LSU violated the civil rights of female athletes with "arrogant ignorance" of their needs. Since this ruling, LSU has made changes in its athletic programs to achieve compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0DA1039F930A25752C0A960958260 |title=Sports People: College Sports;Bias Found at L.S.U. In Title IX Ruling |work=New York Times |author=Associated Press |date=January 13, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an "unusual" case, Title IX was invoked to justify a school's decision to upgrade its [[American football|football]] program from Division I FCS (formerly I-AA) to Division I FBS (formerly I-A). The [[Western Kentucky University]] Board of Regents approved this move in November 2006, to take effect in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wku.edu/news/releases06/november/football.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080115123929/http://wku.edu/news/releases06/november/football.html|publisher=Western Kentucky University|title=WKU Regents Approve Move To Division 1-A Football|date=November 2, 2006|archivedate=2008-01-15|accessdate=2009-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the vote, WKU was purportedly out of Title IX compliance because it had a disproportionately large number of female scholarship athletes. By upgrading football, it increased the percentage of male athletes on scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentucky.com/mld/kentucky/sports/15682246.htm|author=Bailey, Rick|title=State College Notebook: Toppers' switch to I-A probable|publisher=''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]''|date=2006-10-05|accessdate=2006-10-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930204126/http://www.kentucky.com/mld/kentucky/sports/15682246.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the following year, it eliminated its men's soccer team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mvc-sports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=36296&amp;SPID=2895&amp;DB_OEM_ID=7600&amp;ATCLID=1380502|publisher=Western Kentucky University|title=Western Kentucky Athletics Discontinues Men's Soccer|date=2008-02-13|accessdate=2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact

Though views differ as respects the impact of Title 9, discussion typically focuses on whether and to what extent Title IX has resulted in increased athletic opportunities for females, and whether and to what extent Title IX has resulted in decreased athletic opportunities for males.

Advocates of Title IX's current interpretation cite increases in female athletic participation, and attribute those increases to Title IX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Title IX Athletic Statistics | publisher=[[American Association of University Women]] | url=http://www.aauw.org/advocacy/laf/lafnetwork/library/athleticStatistics.cfm |accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ncwge.org/PDF/TitleIXat35.pdf |title=Title IX at 35: Beyond the Headlines|publisher=National Coalition of Women and Girls in Education | accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.titleix.info/ |title=TitleIX.info |accessdate=2009-10-13| publisher=The MARGARET Fund of NWLC  }}&lt;/ref&gt; One study, completed in 2006, pointed to a large increase in the number of women participating in athletics at both the high school and college level. The number of women in high school sports had increased by a factor of nine, while the number of women in college sports had increased by more than 450%.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Jean Carpenter and R. Vivian Acosta, Women in Intercollegiate Sport: A Longitudinal National Study Twenty-Nine Year Update 1977-2006 (2006)).&lt;/ref&gt;A 2008 study of intercollegiate athletics showed that women's collegiate sports has grown to 9,101 teams, or 8.65 per school. The five most frequently offered college sports for women are, in order: (1) Basketball, 98.8% of schools have a team, (2) Volleyball, 95.7%, (3) Soccer, 92.0%, (4) Cross Country, 90.8%, and (5) Softball, 89.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webpages.charter.net/womeninsport/2008%20Summary%20Final.pdf |title=Women in Intercollegiate Sport, a Longitudinal National Study |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, many contend that the current interpretation of Title IX by the OCR has resulted in the dismantling of men's programs, despite strong participation in those sports.&lt;ref name="Shelton 2001"&gt;{{cite news | title=Equally Bad is Not Good: Allowing Title IX "Compliance" by the Elimination of Men's Collegiate Sports  |work=University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform | first=Donald E. |last=Shelton |year=2001 |volume=34 | number=1 |accessdate=2009-10-13 |url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=1163230}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, though interest in the sport of wrestling has consistently increased at the high school level since 1990, 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=USA Wrestling response to quotes by Donna Lopiano - Women's Sports Found. |year=2000 |url=http://www.themat.com/section.php?section_id=3&amp;page=showarticle&amp;ArticleID=2523}}&lt;/ref&gt; scores of colleges have dropped their wrestling programs during that same period.&lt;ref name="collegesportsscholarships.com"&gt;{{cite news | title=Title IX has hurt the college sport, but it is now fighting back. |year=2003 |url=http://www.collegesportsscholarships.com/title-ix-fall-college-wrestling.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="collegian.psu.edu"&gt;{{cite news | title=Wrestling programs threatened by Title IX. |year=1997 |url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/1997/03/03-28-97tdc/03-28-97d03-017.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OCR's three-prong test for compliance with Title IX often is cited as the reason for these cuts.&lt;ref name="collegian.psu.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite news | title=Bucknell to drop wrestling for Title IX compliance. |year=2001 |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/2001-05-02-bucknell-title9.htm.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wrestling historically was the most frequently dropped sport,&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt; but other men's sports later overtook the lead, such that according to the NCAA, the most-dropped men's sports between 1987 and 2002 were as follows:  Cross country (183), and indoor track (180), golf (178), tennis (171), rowing (132), outdoor track (126), swimming (125) and wrestling (121).&lt;ref name="collegesportsscholarships.com"/&gt;

==Controversy==
Title IX has been a source of controversy in part due to claims that the OCR's current interpretation of Title IX, and specifically its three-prong test of compliance, is no longer faithful to the anti-discrimination language in Title IX's text, and instead discriminates against men and has contributed to the reduction of programs for male athletes.&lt;ref name="Shelton 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Irving 2003"&gt;{{cite news | title=Wrestling With Title IX  |work=The New York Times | first=John |last=Irving |year=2003 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/28/opinion/28IRVI.html?pagewanted=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gavora 2003"&gt;{{cite news | title=Tilting the Playing Field:  Schools, Sports, Sex and Title IX | first=Jessica |last=Gavora |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the three-prong test contend that it operates as a "quota" in that it places undue emphasis on the first prong (known as the "proportionality" prong), which fails to take into account any differences in the genders' respective levels of interest in participating in athletics.  Instead it requires that the genders' athletic participation be substantially proportionate to their enrollment, without regard to interest.  Prong two is viewed as only a temporary fix for universities, as universities may only point to past expansion of opportunities for female students for a limited time before compliance with another prong is necessary.  Prong three likewise fails to consider male athletic interest, as it requires that the university fully and effectively accommodate the athletic interests of the "underrepresented sex," despite the fact that DOEd regulations expressly require that the OCR consider whether the institution "effectively accommodate[s] the interests and abilities of members of both sexes."  As such, with a focus on increasing female athletic opportunities without any counterbalance to take male athletic interest into consideration, critics maintain that the OCR's three-prong test actually operates to discriminate against men.&lt;ref name="Shelton 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gavora 2003"/&gt;

Defenders of the three-prong test counter that the genders' differing athletic interest levels is merely a product of past discrimination, and that Title IX should be interpreted to maximize female participation in athletics irrespective of any existing disparity in interest. Thus while defenders argue that the three-prong test embodies the maxim that "opportunity drives interest,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Smith professor speaks on Title IX |work=The Smith College Sophian |year=2008 |url=http://media.www.smithsophian.com/media/storage/paper587/news/2008/12/04/Sports/Smith.Professor.Speaks.On.Title.Ix-3567623.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; critics argue that the three-prong test goes beyond Title IX original purpose of preventing discrimination, and instead amounts to an exercise in governmentally-mandated social engineering whereby athletic opportunities are taken away from male students and given to female students, despite the comparatively lower interest levels of those female students.  Academy Award winning author and self-described women's rights advocate John Irving opined in a New York Times column that on this topic, women's advocates were being "purely vindictive" in insisting that the current OCR interpretation of Title IX be maintained.&lt;ref name="Irving 2003"/&gt;  

On April 20, 2010, the United States Commission on Civil Rights weighed in on the OCR's three-prong test and procedures for implementing it.  On that date, the Commission on Civil Rights released several recommendations on Title IX policy to address what it termed "unnecessary reduction of men's athletic opportunities."&lt;ref name="Brady 2010"&gt;{{cite news | title=Commission: Title IX interpretation unnecessarily hurts men's sports |work=USA Today | first=Erik |last=Brady |year=2010 |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/2010-04-01-title-ix_N.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Commission advocated use of surveys to measure interest, and specifically recommended that the Department of Education's regulations on interest and abilities be revised "to explicitly take into account the interest of both sexes rather than just the interest of the underrepresented sex," almost always females.&lt;ref name="Brady 2010"/&gt;

==Commission on Opportunity in Athletics==
On June 27, 2002, Secretary of Education [[Rod Paige]] announced the creation of the Commission on Opportunity in Athletics (COA), a blue-ribbon panel to examine ways to strengthen enforcement and expand opportunities to ensure fairness for all college athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commission on Opportunity in Athletics|url=http://www.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/athletics/index.html|accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Co-chairs for the COA were [[Cynthia Cooper (basketball)|Cynthia Cooper]] and Ted Leland. The purpose of the Commission was to collect information, analyze issues, and obtain broad public input directed at improving the application of Federal standards for measuring equal opportunity for men and women and boys and girls to participate in athletics under Title IX. Sports scholarships between men and women must be equal.

The panel held four town hall meetings (in Atlanta, Chicago, Colorado Springs, and San Diego) to allow the general public to comment on the past, present, and future of Title IX. On February 26, 2003 the COA issued its final report.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/athletics/report.html COA Report Text&lt;/ref&gt; The COA provided twenty-three recommendations to the Secretary of Education. Although many of the recommendations were unanimous, some of the more controversial recommendations passed by an 8-5 vote. These dealt with considering non-scholarship athletes in prong one of the three-part test for compliance and allowing interest surveys to determine compliance with prong three. On the same day, Secretary of Education Rod Paige announced he would only consider the unanimous recommendations, which provided that the Department of Education (1) reaffirm its strong commitment to equal opportunity for girls and boys, women and men; (2) aggressively enforce Title IX in a uniform way across the nation; (3) give equal weight to all three prongs of the test governing Title IX compliance; and (4) encourage schools to understand that the Department of Education disapproves of cutting teams in order to comply with Title IX.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2003/02/02262003a.html Retrieved 2008-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar U.S. state laws==
Because Title IX only addresses public and private schools that receive federal funding, several states have enacted similar laws to prohibit discrimination based on sex regardless of whether the school receives federal funding. The states are: Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Washington, and Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.WomensSportsFoundation.org/Content/Articles/Issues/Title-IX/S/State-Title-IX-Laws.aspx |title=State Title IX Laws|work=Women's Sports Foundation |accessdate=2008-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
