Title IX has recently been under some controversy, some groups claiming that because of it, some schools are spending more money on women's traditional sports programs and less money in men's traditional sports programs such as [[Wrestling]] and other sports.

Nonetheless, Title IX has been instrumental in the development of women sports and it can be said that it helped the public prepare for today's women's professional sports leagues such as the [[WNBA]] AND [[WUSA]].</rev></revisions></page></pages></query></api>
