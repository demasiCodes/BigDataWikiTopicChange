A '''hate group''' is an organized group or movement that advocates and practices [[hatred]], [[hostility]], or [[violence]] towards members of a [[race (human classification)|race]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[nation]], [[religion]], [[gender]], [[gender identity]], [[sexual orientation]] or any other designated sector of [[society]]. According to the United States [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), a hate group's "primary purpose is to promote animosity, hostility, and malice against persons belonging to a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity/national origin which differs from that of the members of the organization."&lt;ref&gt;"Hate Crime Data Collection Guidelines", ''Uniform Crime Reporting: Summary Reporting System: National Incident-Based Reporting System'', U.S. Department of Justice: Federal Bureau of Investigation, Criminal Justice Information Services Division, Revised October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars find it difficult to define the term ''hate group'' and "whether a particular group is to be classified as a hate group is sometimes in the eye of the beholder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hate Crimes: Causes, Controls, and Controversies|author=Phyllis B. Gerstenfeld|year=2013|edition=3|pages=130–1|isbn=978-1-4522-5662-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, two private organizations that monitor intolerance and hate groups are the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL)&lt;ref name="titleADL: Fighting Anti-Semitism, Bigotry and Extremism"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/ |title=ADL: Fighting Anti-Semitism, Bigotry and Extremism |accessdate=2008-04-13 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC).&lt;ref name="titleSPLCenter.org...forwarding to index.jsp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/ |title=SPLCenter.org...forwarding to index.jsp |accessdate=2008-04-13 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They maintain lists of what they deem to be hate groups, supremacist groups and [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]], anti-government or extremist groups that have committed [[hate crime]]s. The SPLC's definition of a "hate group" includes any group with beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people - particularly when the characteristics being maligned are immutable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/hate-map Hate Map] - SPLC&lt;/ref&gt; However, at least for the SPLC, inclusion of a group in the list "does not imply a group advocates or engages in violence or other criminal activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/hate-map| title=Hate Map| accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the SPLC, from 2000 to 2008, hate group activity saw a 50 percent increase in the US, with a total of 926 active groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Katel |first=Peter |date=2009-05-08 |title=Hate Groups |volume=19 |issue=18 |pages=421–448 |publisher=[[CQ Researcher]]}}  See "The Year in Hate" Southern Poverty Law Center, February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI does not publish a list of hate groups, and "[I]nvestigations are conducted only when a threat or advocacy of force is made; when the group has the apparent ability to carry out the proclaimed act; and when the act would constitute a potential violation of federal law."&lt;ref name=fbifaq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/faqs|title=Frequently Asked Questions|work=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]|accessdate=May 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization maintains statistics on [[hate crimes]].&lt;ref name=fbifaq/&gt;

==Violence and hate crimes==
{{Further|Hate crime}}
Four categories associated with hate groups' propensity for violence are: organizational capacity, organizational constituency, strategic connectivity, and structural arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chermak|first=S.|author2=Freilich, J. |author3=Suttmoeller, M. |title=The organizational dynamics of far-right hate groups in the United States: comparing violent to nonviolent organizations|journal=Studies in Conflict and Terrorism|date=2013|volume=36|pages=193–218|doi=10.1080/1057610X.2013.755912}}&lt;/ref&gt; The larger an extremist group is and the longer it has existed, the more prone the group is to engage in violence.  Regionally, hate groups based in the West and Northeast are more likely to engage in violence than those based in the South.  If a group has a charismatic leader, it is more likely to be violent.  Groups that share a conflict-based relationship with another group are more likely to engage in extreme violence.  The amount of ideological literature a group publishes is linked to significant decreases in a group's violent behavior, with more literature linked to lower levels of violence.

Violent hate groups tend to commit "downward crimes," which involve the persecution of a minority group by a more powerful majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deloughery|first=K.|author2=King, R.D. |author3=Asal, V. |title=Close cousins or distant relatives?: the relationship between terrorism and hate crime|journal=Crime and Delinquency|date=2012|volume=58|pages=663–688|doi=10.1177/0011128712452956}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, acts of terrorism are typically "upward crimes," with a low-power minority perpetrator targeting a more prominent majority group.  There is no evidence suggesting that hate crimes precede terrorism; in fact, hate crimes tend to take place as retaliation following terrorist attacks, especially when the attack was on a core piece of American identity or ideology.

The California Association for Human Relations Organizations (CAHRO) asserts that hate groups such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) and [[White Aryan Resistance]] (WAR) preach violence against racial, religious, sexual and other minorities in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cahro.org/2011/08/freedom-from-fear-ending-californias-hate-violence-epidemic/ |title=FREEDOM FROM FEAR: Ending California’s Hate Violence Epidemic &amp;#124; CAHRO – California Association of Human Relations Organizations |publisher=Cahro.org |date=1992-01-07 |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph E. Agne argues that hate-motivated violence is a result of the successes of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement|civil rights movement]], and he asserts that the KKK has resurfaced and that new hate groups have formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gbgm-umc.org/advance/Church-Burnings/hategrup.html#consult |title=The Church's Response to Hate-Group Violence |publisher=Gbgm-umc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agne argues that it is a mistake to underestimate the strength of the hate-violence movement, its [[apologist]]s and its silent partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gbgm-umc.org/advance/Church-Burnings/hategrup.html#consult The Church's Response to Hate-Group Violence&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, crimes that "manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity, including the crimes of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter; forcible rape; robbery; aggravated assault; burglary; larceny-theft; motor vehicle theft; arson; simple assault; intimidation; and destruction, damage or vandalism of property", 
directed at the government, an individual, a business, or institution, involving hate groups and hate crimes, may be investigated as acts of domestic terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;The Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program - Data Quality Guidelines for Statistics - APPENDIX III—A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE HATE CRIME PROGRAM [http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/guidelines/guidelines.htm#hatecrimehistory]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation - Civil Rights - Hate Crime Overview - The FBI’s Role [http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cid/civilrights/overview.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2006/index.html Hate Crime Statistics, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1999 Developing Hate Crime Questions for the National Crime Victim Survey (NCVS) Pg. 1 {{Wayback |date=20030512103017 |url=https://www.amstat.org/sections/srms/Proceedings/papers/1999_181.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hate speech==
{{Further|Hate speech}}
[[Counter-terrorism]] expert Ehud Sprinzak argues that verbal violence is "the use of extreme language against an individual or a group that either implies a direct threat that physical force will be used against them, or is seen as an indirect call for others to use it." Sprinzak argues that verbal violence is often a substitute for real violence, and that the verbalization of hate has the potential to incite people who are incapable of distinguishing between real and verbal violence to engage in actual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Sprinzak, Ehud, ''Brother against Brother: Violence and Extremism in Israeli Politics from Altalena to the Rabin Assassination'' (New York: The Free Press, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

People tend to judge the offensiveness of hate speech on a gradient depending on how public the speech is and what group it targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cowan|first=G.|author2=Hodge, C.|title=Judgments of hate speech: the effects of target group, publicness, and behavioral responses of the target|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|date=1996|volume=26|pages=355–371|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1996.tb01854.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although people's opinions of hate speech are complex, they typically consider public speech targeting ethnic minorities to be the most offensive.

Historian [[Daniel Goldhagen]], discussing [[Anti-semitism|antisemitic]] hate groups, argues that we should view verbal violence as "an assault in its own right, having been intended to produce profound damage—emotional, psychological, and social—to the dignity and honor of the [[Jews]]. The wounds that people suffer by ... such vituperation ... can be as bad as ... [a] beating."&lt;ref&gt;Goldhagen, Daniel Jonah, ''Hitler’s Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans the Holocaust'' (Knopf, 1996), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, the popularity of the Internet brought new international exposure to many organizations, including groups with beliefs such as [[white supremacy]], [[neo-Nazism]], [[homophobia]], [[Holocaust denial]] and [[Islamophobia]]. Several white supremacist groups have founded websites dedicated to attacking their perceived enemies. In 1996, the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] of Los Angeles asked Internet access providers to adopt a code of ethics that would prevent extremists from publishing their ideas online. In 1996, the [[European Commission]] formed the Consultative Commission on Racism and Xenophobia (CRAX), a pan-European group which was tasked to "investigate and, using legal means, stamp out the current wave of racism on the Internet."&lt;ref&gt;Newsbytes News Network (31 January 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious hate groups==
{{see also|List of organizations designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as anti-gay hate groups}}
The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC) has designated several Christian groups as hate groups, including the [[American Family Association]], the [[Family Research Council]], [[Abiding Truth Ministries]], [[American Vision]], the [[Chalcedon Foundation]], the [[Dove World Outreach Center]], the [[Traditional Values Coalition]] and [[Westboro Baptist Church]]. Some conservatives have criticized the SPLC for its inclusion of certain Christian groups, such as the Family Research Council, on its list.&lt;ref name="Is the FRC really a hate group?"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sessions|first=David|title=Is the Family Research Council Really a Hate Group?|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/08/16/is-the-family-research-council-really-a-hate-group.html|accessdate=3 August 2014|newspaper=[http://Thedailybeast.com Thedailybeast.com]|date=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SPLC-18-List"&gt;{{cite news|last=Waddington|first=Lynda|title=Groups that Helped Oust Iowa Judges Earn 'Hate Group' Designation; SPLC Adds American Family Association, Family Research Council to List|url=http://iowaindependent.com/47947/groups-that-helped-oust-iowa-judges-earn-hate-group-designation|accessdate=25 November 2010|newspaper=[[American Independent News Network|Iowa Independent]]|date=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo hate"&gt;{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Krissah|title='Hate group' designation angers same-sex marriage opponents|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/24/AR2010112405573.html|accessdate=25 November 2010|newspaper=Washington Post|date=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) and Its So-Called 'Hate Groups'"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sprigg|first=Peter|title=The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) and Its So-Called 'Hate Groups'|url=http://www.frc.org/issuebrief/the-southern-poverty-law-center-splc-and-its-so-called-hate-groups|accessdate=6 August 2014|newspaper=[http://frc.org The Family Research Council]|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SPLC classes the [[Nation of Islam]] (NOI) as a hate group under the category "black separatist".&lt;ref name=jessup&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1IL-RQcFjRsC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;vq=hate+organizations&amp;dq=%22Hate+organizations%22&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;sig=ACfU3U3UPapDLm3h82CpppP_PmUVMLvKEg Jessup, Michael "The Sword of Truth in the Sea of Lies: The Theology of Hate", in Priest, Robert J. and Alvaro L. Nieves, eds., ''This Side of Heaven'' (Oxford University Press US, 2006) ISBN 0-19-531056-X, Google Print, pp. 165-66]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/map/type.jsp?DT=3 SPLC - Active U.S. Hate Groups in 2008: Black Separatist]&lt;/ref&gt; The NOI preaches that a black scientist named [[Yakub (Nation of Islam)|Yakub]] created the white race, a "race of devils", on the Greek island of [[Patmos]]. The NOI, unlike traditional [[Muslim]] groups, does not accept white members and it is not regarded as a legitimate branch of [[Islam]] by mainstream [[Muslim]]s.

The [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] [[Creativity Movement]] (formerly the World Church of the Creator), led by [[Matthew F. Hale]], is associated with violence and [[bigotry]]. [[Aryan Nations]] is another religiously-based white supremacist hate group.

Westboro Baptist Church is considered a hate group because of its provocative stance against [[homosexuality]] and the [[United States]], and it has been condemned by many mainstream gay rights opponents as well as by gay rights supporters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=627 The year in hate 2005], [[Southern Poverty Law Center]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet hate groups==

Traditionally, hate groups recruited members and spread extremist messages by word of mouth, or through the distribution of flyers and pamphlets. In contrast, the Internet allows hate group members from all over the world to engage in real-time conversations.&lt;ref name="Meddaugh and Kay 2009"&gt;Meddaugh and Kay (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet has been a boon for hate groups in terms of promotion, recruitment and expanding their base to include younger audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Schafer and Navarro (2002); Williamson and Pierson (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; An Internet hate group does not have to be part of a traditional faction such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/nmediac/summer2012/Articles/obama_facebook.htm Moody, M., "New Media-Same Stereotypes: An Analysis of Social Media Depictions of President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama", 'The Journal of New Media &amp; Culture'' (2012).]&lt;/ref&gt;

While many hate sites are explicitly antagonistic or violent, others may appear patriotic or benign, and this façade may contribute to the appeal of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McNamee|first=L.G.|author2=Peterson, B.L. |author3=Pena, J. |title=A call to educate, participate, invoke, and indict: understanding the communication of online hate groups|journal=Communication Monographs|date=2010|volume=77|pages=257–280|doi=10.1080/03637751003758227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hate group websites work towards the following goals: to educate group members and the public, to encourage participation, to claim a divine calling and privilege, and to accuse out-groups (e.g. the government or media).  Groups that work effectively towards these goals via an online presence tend to strengthen their sense of identity, decrease threat levels from out-groups, and recruit more new members.

The [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] (SWC), in its 2009 ''iReport'', identified more than 10,000 problematic hate and [[terrorist websites]] and other Internet postings. The report includes hate websites, social networks, [[blog]]s, newsgroups, [[YouTube]] and other video sites. The findings illustrate that as the Internet continues to grow, extremists find new ways to seek validation for their hateful agendas and to recruit members.

Creators of hate pages and groups on [[Facebook]] choose their target, set up their page or group, and then recruit members.&lt;ref&gt;Perry and Olsson (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone can create a Facebook group and invite followers to post comments, add pictures and participate in discussion boards. A Facebook page is similar, with the exception that one must "like" the page in order to become a member. Because of the ease of creating and joining such groups, many so-called hate groups exist only in cyberspace.&lt;ref name="Meddaugh and Kay 2009"/&gt;

==Psychology of hate groups==
Hateful intergroup conflict may be motivated by "[[in-group]] love," a desire to positively contribute to the group to which one belongs, or "[[out-group]] hate," a desire to injure a foreign group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Halevy|first=N.|author2=Weisel, O. |author3=Bornstein, G. |title="In-group love" and "out-group hate" in repeated interaction between groups|journal=Journal of behavioral decision making|date=2012|volume=25|pages=188–195|doi=10.1002/bdm.726}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both individuals and groups are more motivated by "in-group love" than "out-group hate," even though both motivations might advance a group's status.  This preference is especially salient when a group is not situated in a competitive position against another.  This partiality towards cooperative behavior suggests that intergroup conflict might decline if group members devoted more energy to positive in-group improvements than to out-group competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Halevy|first=N.|author2=Bornstein, G. |author3=Sagiv, L. |title="In-group love" and "out-group hate" as motives for individual participation in intergroup conflict|journal=Psychological Science|date=2008|volume=19|pages=405–411|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02100.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups formed around a set of moral codes are more likely than non-morality-based groups to exhibit "out-group hate" as a response to their especially strong sense of "in-group love."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parker|first=M.T.|author2=Janoff-Bulman, R.|title=Lessons from morality-based social identity: the power of outgroup "hate," not just ingroup "love"|journal=Social Justice Research|date=2013|volume=26|pages=81–96|doi=10.1007/s11211-012-0175-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intergroup threat occurs when one group's interests threaten another group's goals and well-being.&lt;ref name="Stephan 2000 23–45"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stephan|first=W.G.|author2=Stephan, C.W.|title=An integrated theory of prejudice|journal=Reducing prejudice and discrimination: The Claremont Symposium on applied social psychology|date=2000|pages=23–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intergroup threat theories provide a framework for intergroup biases and aggression.&lt;ref name="Riek 2006 336–353"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riek|first=B.M.|author2=Mania, E.W. |author3=Gaertner, S.L. |title=Intergroup threat and outgroup attitudes: a meta-analytic review|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date=2006|volume=10|pages=336–353|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr1004_4|pmid=17201592|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One type of intergroup threat theory, [[realistic group conflict theory]], addresses competition between groups by positing that when two groups are competing for limited resources, one group's potential success is at odds with the other's interests, which leads to negative out-group attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherif, M., &amp; Sherif, C.W.|title=Social psychology|date=1969|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=New York|pages=221–266}}&lt;/ref&gt; If groups have the same goal, their interactions will be positive, but opposing goals will worsen intergroup relations.  Intergroup conflict may increase in-group unity, leading to a larger disparity and more conflict between groups.

[[Symbolic threat]] theory proposes that intergroup bias and conflict result from conflicting ideals, not from perceived competition or opposing goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McConahay|first=J.B.|title=Self-interest versus racial attitudes as correlates of anti-busing attitudes in Louisville: Is it the buses or the blacks?|journal=Journal of Politics|volume=441|pages=692–720}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biases based on symbolic threat tend to be stronger predictors of practical behavior towards out-groups than biases based on realistic threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kinder|first=D.R.|author2=Sears, D.O.|title=Prejudice and politics: Symbolic racism versus racial threats to the good life|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1981|volume=40|pages=414–431|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.40.3.414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Realistic group conflict theory and symbolic threat theory are, in some cases, compatible.  [[Integrated-threat theory]] recognizes that conflict can arise from a combination of intergroup dynamics and classifies threats into four types: realistic threat, symbolic threat, [[intergroup anxiety]], and negative [[stereotypes]].&lt;ref name="Stephan 2000 23–45"/&gt; Intergroup threat theories provide a framework for intergroup biases and aggression.&lt;ref name="Riek 2006 336–353"/&gt; Intergroup anxiety refers to a felt uneasiness around members of other groups, which is predictive of biased attitudes and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ho|first=C.|author2=Jackson, J.W.|title=Attitudes toward Asian Americans: Theory and measurement|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|date=2001|volume=31|pages=1553–1581|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2001.tb02742.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative stereotypes are also correlated with these behaviors, causing threat based on negative expectations about an out-group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagley|first=A.H.|author2=Mladinic, A.|title=Gender stereotypes and attitudes toward women and men|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=1989|volume=15|pages=543–558|doi=10.1177/0146167289154008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 7-stage hate model, a hate group, if unimpeded, passes through seven successive stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title =2003 FBI Law Enforcement bulletin
| url =http://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/law-enforcement-bulletin/2003-pdfs/mar03leb.pdf/at_download/file
| year =2003
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schafer 2006 73–86"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schafer|first=J.R.|title=The seven-stage hate model: the psychopathology of hate groups|journal=Cultic Studies Review|date=2006|volume=5|pages=73–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first four stages, hate groups vocalize their beliefs and in the last three stages, they act on their beliefs.  Factors that contribute to a group's likelihood to act include the vulnerability of its members as well as its reliance on symbols and mythologies.  This model points to a transition period that exists between verbal violence and acting out that violence, separating hardcore haters from rhetorical haters. Thus, [[hate speech]] is seen as a prerequisite of [[hate crime]]s, and as a [[condition of possibility|condition of their possibility]].

Hate group intervention is most possible if a group has not yet passed from the speech to the action stage, and interventions on immature hate groups are more effective than those that are firmly established.&lt;ref name="Schafer 2006 73–86"/&gt; Intervention and rehabilitation is most effective when the one investigating a hate group can identify and deconstruct personal insecurities of group members, which in turn contribute to the weakness of the group.  Perhaps most critical to combating group hate is to prevent the recruitment of new members by supporting those who are most susceptible, especially children and youth, in developing a positive self-esteem and a humanized understanding of out-groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=R.J.|title=The Psychology of Hate|date=2005|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=61–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;
