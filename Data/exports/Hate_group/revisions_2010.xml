A '''hate group''' is an organized group or movement that advocates and practices [[hate]], [[hostility]], or [[violence]] towards members of a race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation or other designated sector of society.  Common examples include: [[white supremacy]] organizations like the [[Ku Klux Klan]]; [[neo-Nazi]] organizations like [[Aryan Nations]], [[skinhead]] organizations, organizations promoting ethnic conflicts, even [[ethnic cleansing]], and other similar groups.  Many hate organizations are also influenced by religious belief.&lt;ref name=jessup&gt;Michael Jessup, ''The Sword of Truth in the Sea of Lies: The Theology of Hate'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=1IL-RQcFjRsC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;vq=hate+organizations&amp;dq=%22Hate+organizations%22&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;sig=ACfU3U3UPapDLm3h82CpppP_PmUVMLvKEg Google Print, p.165-p.166], in Robert J. Priest, Alvaro L. Nieves (ed.), ''This Side of Heaven'', Oxford University Press US, 2006, ISBN 019531056X&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, two main organizations that monitor intolerance and hate groups are the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL)&lt;ref name="titleADL: Fighting Anti-Semitism, Bigotry and Extremism"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/ |title=ADL: Fighting Anti-Semitism, Bigotry and Extremism |accessdate=2008-04-13 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC).&lt;ref name="titleSPLCenter.org...forwarding to index.jsp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/ |title=SPLCenter.org...forwarding to index.jsp |accessdate=2008-04-13 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such groups are also tracked by the [[FBI]].&lt;ref name=jessup/&gt; The ADL and the SPLC maintain a list of what they deem to be hate groups, supremacist groups, and [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]], anti-government or extremist groups that have committed [[hate crime]]s. However, at least for the SPLC, inclusion of a group in the list "does not imply a group advocates or engages in violence or other criminal activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/hate-map| title=Hate Map| accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, from 2000 to 2008, hate group activity saw a 50 percent increase in the United States, with a total of 926 active groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Katel |first=Peter |date=2009-05-08 |title=Hate Groups |volume=19 |issue=18 |pages=421-448 |publisher=[[CQ Researcher]]}}  See "The Year in Hate" Southern Poverty Law Center, February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violence==
{{See|Hate crime}}
The California Association for Human Relations Organizations (CAHRO) asserts that hate groups such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) and [[White Aryan Resistance]] preach violence against racial, religious, sexual and other minorities in the United States. Joseph E. Agne argues that hate-motivated violence is a result of the successes of the civil rights movement, and asserts that the KKK has resurfaced and new hate groups have formed.&lt;ref&gt;http://gbgm-umc.org/advance/Church-Burnings/hategrup.html#consult&lt;/ref&gt; Agne argues that it is a mistake to underestimate the strength of the hate-violence movement, its [[apologist]]s, and its silent partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gbgm-umc.org/advance/Church-Burnings/hategrup.html#consult The Church's Response to Hate-Group Violence&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, crimes that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity, including the crimes of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter; forcible rape; robbery; aggravated assault; burglary; larceny-theft; motor vehicle theft; arson; simple assault; intimidation; and destruction, damage or vandalism of property
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
directed at the government, an individual, a business, or institution, involving hate groups and hate crimes, may be investigated as acts of domestic terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;The Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program - Data Quality Guidelines for Statistics - APPENDIX III—A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE HATE CRIME PROGRAM [http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/guidelines/guidelines.htm#hatecrimehistory]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation - Civil Rights - Hate Crime Overview - The FBI’s Role [http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cid/civilrights/overview.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2006/index.html Hate Crime Statistics, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1999 Developing Hate Crime Questions for the National Crime Victim Survey (NCVS) Pg. 1 [http://66.102.1.104/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=cache:vynjDEZksWEJ:https://www.amstat.org/sections/srms/Proceedings/papers/1999_181.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hate speech==
{{See|Hate speech}}
Counterterrorism expert [[Ehud Sprinzak]] argues that verbal violence is "the use of extreme language against an individual or a group that either implies a direct threat that physical force will be used against them, or is seen as an indirect call for others to use it." Sprinzak argues that verbal violence is often a substitute for real violence, and that the verbalization of hate has the potential to incite people who are incapable of distinguishing between real and verbal violence to engage in actual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Sprinzak, Ehud. ''Brother against Brother: Violence and Extremism in Israeli Politics from Altalena to the Rabin Assassination.'' New York: The Free Press (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Daniel Goldhagen]], discussing [[Anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] hate groups, argues that we should view verbal violence as "an assault in its own right, having been intended to produce profound damage—emotional, psychological, and social—to the dignity and honor of the Jews. The wounds that people suffer by... such vituperation... can be as bad as... [a] beating."&lt;ref&gt;Goldhagen, Daniel Jonah, ''Hitler’s Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans the Holocaust'' (Knopf, 1996), p.&amp;nbsp;124.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, the popularity of the [[Internet]] brought new international exposure to many organizations, including groups with beliefs such as [[white supremacy]], [[neo nazi]], [[homophobia]], [[Holocaust denial]], [[Misandry]] or [[Islamophobia]]. Several white supremacist groups have founded websites dedicated to attacking their perceived enemies.The klan started with 6 people and is now up to numbers over 100,000.In 1996, the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] of Los Angeles asked Internet access providers to adopt a code of ethics that would prevent extremists from publishing their ideas online. In 1996, the [[European Commission]] formed the Consultative Commission on Racism and Xenophobia (CRAX), a pan-European group which was tasked to "investigate and, using legal means, stamp out the current wave of racism on the Internet."&lt;ref&gt;''Newsbytes News Network, 31 January 1996''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious hate groups==
The former "World Church of the Creator", now renamed the [[Creativity Movement]], is led by [[Matthew F. Hale]] and is tied to violence and bigotry. The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] classes the [[Nation of Islam]] (NOI), an influential [[African-American]] group, as a hate group under the category "Black separatist".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/map/type.jsp?DT=3 SPLC - Active U.S. Hate Groups in 2008: Black Separatist]&lt;/ref&gt; The NOI preaches that a black scientist named [[Yakub (Nation of Islam)|Yakub]] created the white race, a "race of devils", on the Greek island of [[Patmos]]. The NOI, unlike traditional [[Islam]]ic groups, does not accept white members and is not regarded as a legitimate branch of Islam by mainstream Muslims. The [[Westboro Baptist Church]] is considered a hate group for its provocative stance against homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=627 The year in hate 2005], [[Southern Poverty Law Center]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychopathology of hate groups==
According to a 2003 [[FBI]] Law Enforcement bulletin, a hate group, if unimpeded, passes through seven successive stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title =2003 [[FBI]] Law Enforcement bulletin
| url =http://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/law-enforcement-bulletin/2003-pdfs/mar03leb.pdf/at_download/file
| year =2003
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first four stages, hate groups vocalize their beliefs and in the last three stages, they act on their beliefs. The report points to a transition period that exists between verbal violence and acting that violence out, separating hardcore haters from rhetorical haters. Thus, [[hate speech]] is seen as a prerequisite of [[hate crimes]], and as a [[condition of possibility|condition of their possibility]].
