{{Discrimination sidebar}}

A '''hate group''' is an organized group or movement that advocates physical or verbal aggression toward or [[Social rejection|refusal to interact with]] persons on the basis of those persons' possession and/or exhibition of a certain characteristic.  Many hate groups espouse or rhetorically appeal to the proposition that persons exhibiting the characteristic in question are members of a group of persons exhibiting that characteristic, regardless of whether that group's existence, boundaries, and set of members are self-proclaimed or are instead merely alleged by the hate group to possess an independent existence [[Supervenience|arising from]] conceptual distinctions that the hate group draws.  Such hate groups then frequently invoke membership in that group as a conceptually or rhetorically distinct basis for discrimination, both against the (alleged) group as a whole and against its individual members.

Characteristics frequently invoked by hate groups as a basis for discrimination include the possession of, profession of, or identification with a particular ethnic origin, religion, sex, and/or sexual orientation (usually as opposed to another [[Phenotype|characteristic within the same category]] that the hate group [[Norm (sociology)|prefers]]), along with membership in a group or class corresponding to the set of persons exhibiting that characteristic or characteristics.

==Violence==
The California Association for Human Relations Organizations (CAHRO) asserts that hate groups such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and [[White Aryan Resistance]] preach violence against racial, religious, sexual and other minorities in the United States. These groups have hotlines, websites, Internet chatrooms, and propaganda distribution networks designed to transform fear into violence, and to brutalize minorities and vandalize their property. Joseph E. Agne argues that hate-motivated violence is a result of the successes of the civil rights movement, and asserts that the Ku Klux Klan has resurfaced and new hate groups have formed.&lt;ref&gt;http://gbgm-umc.org/advance/Church-Burnings/hategrup.html#consult&lt;/ref&gt; Agne asserts that it is a mistake to underestimate the strength of the hate-violence movement, its [[apologist]]s, and its silent partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gbgm-umc.org/advance/Church-Burnings/hategrup.html#consult The Church's Response to Hate-Group Violence&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, crimes that "manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity, including the crimes of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter; forcible rape; robbery; aggravated assault; burglary; larceny-theft; motor vehicle theft; arson; simple assault; intimidation; and destruction, damage or vandalism of property" directed at the U.S. government, an individual, a business, or institution, involving hate groups and hate crimes, may be investigated as acts of domestic terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;The Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program - Data Quality Guidelines for Statistics - APPENDIX III—A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE HATE CRIME PROGRAM [http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/guidelines/guidelines.htm#hatecrimehistory]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation - Civil Rights - Hate Crime Overview - The FBI’s Role [http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cid/civilrights/overview.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2006/index.html Hate Crime Statistics, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1999 Developing Hate Crime Questions for the National Crime Victim Survey (NCVS) Pg. 1 [http://66.102.1.104/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=cache:vynjDEZksWEJ:https://www.amstat.org/sections/srms/Proceedings/papers/1999_181.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hate speech==
{{See|Hate speech}}
Dr. Ehud Sprinzak, an expert on terrorism and hate crimes, asserts that verbal violence is "the use of extreme language against an individual or a group that either implies a direct threat that physical force will be used against them, or is seen as an indirect call for others to use it." Sprinzak argues that verbal violence is often a substitute for real violence, and that the verbalization of hate has the potential to incite people who are incapable of distinguishing between real and verbal violence to engage in actual violence. Historian [[Daniel Goldhagen]], discussing [[Anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] hate groups, argues that we should view "verbal violence... as an assault in its own right, having been intended to produce profound damage—emotional, psychological, and social—to the dignity and honor of the Jews. The wounds that people suffer by... such vituperation... can be as bad as... [a] beating."

===Hate groups and the Internet ===
In the mid-1990s, the popularity of the [[Internet]] brought new international exposure to many organizations, including groups with beliefs such as [[white supremacy]], homophobia, [[Holocaust denial]] or [[Islamophobia]]. Since the advent of the Internet, a common tactic by hate groups is the use of [[Cyberstalking]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Several white supremacist groups have founded websites dedicated to attacking their perceived enemies. Targets of such attacks include [[Ken McVay]], founder of the [[Nizkor Project]], and [[Morris Dees]], founder of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]]. 

In 1996, the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] of Los Angeles asked Internet access providers to adopt a code of ethics that would prevent extremists from publishing their ideas online. Internet providers that adopt the code would refuse service to individuals or groups that "promote violence and mayhem, denigrate and threaten minorities and women, and promote homophobia." 

In 1996, the [[European Commission]] formed the Consultative Commission on Racism and Xenophobia (CRAX), a pan-European group to "encourage the mixing of people of different cultures" from both inside and outside Europe, tasked to "investigate and, using legal means, stamp out the current wave of racism on the Internet."&lt;ref&gt;''Newsbytes News Network, [[31 January]] [[1996]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hate groups and religion==
[[White nationalist]]s and [[white supremacist]]s have created a number of religions. [[William Luther Pierce]], founder of the [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]], also founded the religion of [[Cosmotheism]]. The former "World Church of the Creator", now renamed the [[Creativity Movement]], is led by [[Matthew F. Hale]] and is tied to violence and bigotry.

Some [[new religious movements]] (NRMs) have seized upon [[anti-cult movement]] (ACM) critique and what they see as hostile acts of their unfavorable former members, and cited them as examples of religious [[intolerance]], [[persecution]], and [[bigotry]]. [[CESNUR]]’s president [[Massimo Introvigne]], writes in his article ''"So many evil things: Anti-cult terrorism via the Internet"''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/testi/anticult_terror.htm CESNUR - "So Many Evil Things": Anti-Cult Terrorism via the Internet&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;, that fringe and extreme [[anti-cult movement|anti-cult activism]] resort to tactics that may create a background favorable to extreme manifestations of [[discrimination]] and [[hate]] against individuals that belong to new religious movements.   Somewhat in concurrence with Introvigne, professor [[Eileen Barker]] asserts that the controversy surrounding certain new religious movements can turn violent by a process called [[deviancy amplification spiral]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fathom.com/feature/121938/ Fathom :: The Source for Online Learning&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychopathology of hate groups==
According to a 2003 [[FBI]] Law Enforcement bulletin &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title       =2003 [[FBI]] Law Enforcement bulletin
| url         =http://www.fbi.gov/publications/leb/2003/mar03leb.pdf
| year        =2003
}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a hate group, if unimpeded, passes through seven successive stages. In the first four stages, hate groups vocalize their beliefs and in the last three stages, they act on their beliefs. The report points to a transition period that exists between verbal violence and acting that violence out, separating hardcore haters from rhetorical haters. Thus, [[hate speech]] is seen as prerequisites of [[hate crimes]] and as a [[condition of possibility|condition of their possibility]]. Similar stages have been proposed for [[Genocide#Stages of genocide and efforts to prevent it|genocide]].

==Classification of hate groups==
The classification of other groups as a hate group is [[controversy|controversial]] and little or no [[consensus]] has developed as to whether [[political]], [[religious]] or anti-religious movements deserve the label hate group. In the United States, two of the several organizations that claim to address intolerance and hate groups are the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL)&lt;ref name="titleADL: Fighting Anti-Semitism, Bigotry and Extremism"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/ |title=ADL: Fighting Anti-Semitism, Bigotry and Extremism |accessdate=2008-04-13 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC).&lt;ref name="titleSPLCenter.org...forwarding to index.jsp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/ |title=SPLCenter.org...forwarding to index.jsp |accessdate=2008-04-13 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ADL and the SPLC  maintain a list of what they deem to be hate groups, to be supremacist groups, [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]], anti-government or extremist groups that have committed "[[hate crime]]s." The [[Westboro Baptist Church]] is also considered a hate group by [[gay]] rights activists, the ADL and many others for its provocative and bitter stance against homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=627 The year in hate 2005], [[Southern Poverty Law Center]].&lt;/ref&gt;
