[[Scientific consensus]] holds that [[vaccines]] do not cause autism, but popular rumors and an article in a respected scientific journal, ''[[The Lancet]],'' provoked concern among parents.

==Epidemiology ==
{{Main|Epidemiology of autism}}

The epidemiology of autism is the study of factors affecting [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD). Most recent reviews of [[epidemiology]] estimate a [[prevalence]] of one to two cases per 1,000 people for [[autism]], and about six per 1,000 for ASD;&lt;ref name=Newschaffer&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Newschaffer CJ, Croen LA, Daniels J ''et al.'' |author.= |title=The epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders |journal=Annu Rev Public Health |year=2007 |volume=28 |pages=235–58 |pmid=17367287 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144007 |url=http://idea.library.drexel.edu/bitstream/1860/2632/1/2006175339.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; because of inadequate data, these numbers may underestimate ASD's true prevalence.&lt;ref name=Caronna&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Arch Dis Child |date=2008 |volume=93 |issue=6 |pages=518–23 |title=Autism spectrum disorders: clinical and research frontiers |author=Caronna EB, Milunsky JM, Tager-Flusberg H |doi=10.1136/adc.2006.115337 |pmid=18305076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ASD averages a 4.3:1 male-to-female ratio.

==Genetics==
{{details|Heritability of autism}}

There is evidence that autism has a genetic component,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Dunham, Will | url = http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN1623067120070219 | title = International study finds new autism genetic links |publisher = Reuters | date = 2007-02-19 | accessdate = 2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ongoing research focuses on finding the biomarkers that determine autistic [[phenotype]]s. One yet unproven theory is that there may be genes which contribute to a vulnerability to environmental triggers or have another role in the etiology of autism.

Genetics is viewed as an underlying factor. Though there is a statistical pattern for a significantly high risk to have another autistic child in families with an already affected child.&lt;ref&gt;http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/285/24/3093.full#ref-34&lt;/ref&gt; However, while some parents of those with autism are progressively also being diagnosed on the autism spectrum, at least some autistic children have apparently [[neurotypical]] parents. This suggests to some that genetics are either not a necessary cause or that they don't play a part in all cases of ASD, although it could also mean that the gene(s) responsible may be recessive or a [[Mutation|spontaneous mutation]]. The spectrum of autistic disorders is notable for its significant [[gender]] disparity, with the incidence of autism in males greatly exceeding the incidence in females. Whilst this could be evidence for a genetic theory, it has also been argued that male brains may be more vulnerable during early development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Kimura, Doreen | date = 2002-05-13 | url = http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00018E9D-879D-1D06-8E49809EC588EEDF | title = Sex Differences in the Brain | publisher = Scientific American | accessdate = 2008-02-29}}{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vaccines==
Several controversial claims have been made with regard to [[autism]] and [[vaccinations]], leading notably to the [[MMR vaccine controversy]], the [[thiomersal controversy]], and the theory of [[vaccine overload]]. A 2011 journal article described the vaccine-autism connection as "the most damaging medical hoax of the last 100 years".&lt;ref name=Klaherty&gt;{{cite journal |author=Flaherty DK |title=The vaccine-autism connection: a public health crisis caused by unethical medical practices and fraudulent science |journal=Ann Pharmacother |volume=45 |issue=10 |pages=1302–4 |year=2011 |month=October |pmid=21917556 |doi=10.1345/aph.1Q318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vaccine overload ===

{{details|Vaccine controversy#Vaccine overload}}

Vaccine overload is the notion that giving many vaccines at once may overwhelm or weaken a child's immune system and lead to adverse effects.&lt;ref name=Hilton&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hilton S, Petticrew M, Hunt K |title='Combined vaccines are like a sudden onslaught to the body's immune system': parental concerns about vaccine 'overload' and 'immune-vulnerability' |journal=Vaccine |volume=24 |issue=20 |pages=4321–4327 |year=2006 |pmid=16581162 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.03.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of vaccine overload is flawed, for several reasons.&lt;ref name=Gerber&gt;{{cite journal |author= Gerber JS, Offit PA |title= Vaccines and autism: a tale of shifting hypotheses |journal= Clin Infect Dis |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=456–461 |year=2009 |pmid=19128068 |pmc= 2908388 |doi=10.1086/596476 |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/596476 |laysummary=http://www.idsociety.org/Content.aspx?id=13336 |laysource=IDSA |laydate=2009-01-30}}{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First, vaccines do not overwhelm the immune system; in fact, conservative estimates predict that the immune system can respond to thousands of viruses simultaneously.&lt;ref name=Gerber/&gt; It is known that vaccines constitute only a tiny fraction of the pathogens already naturally encountered by a child in a typical year.&lt;ref name=Gerber/&gt; Common fevers and middle ear infections pose a much greater challenge to the immune system than vaccines do.&lt;ref&gt;Immune challenges:

===Thiomersal===
{{Main|Thiomersal controversy}}

In 1999, the [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) and the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP) asked vaccine makers to remove the [[organomercury]] compound [[thiomersal]] (spelled "thimerosal" in the U.S.) from vaccines as quickly as possible, and thiomersal has been phased out of U.S. and European vaccines, except for some preparations of [[influenza vaccine]].&lt;ref name=Offit&gt;{{cite journal |journal=N Engl J Med |year=2007 |volume=357 |issue=13 |pages=1278–1279 |title=Thimerosal and vaccines—a cautionary tale |author=Offit PA |doi=10.1056/NEJMp078187 |pmid=17898096 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/13/1278 |authorlink=Paul Offit}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC and the AAP followed the [[precautionary principle]], which assumes that there is no harm in exercising caution even if it later turns out to be unwarranted, but their 1999 action sparked confusion and controversy that has diverted attention and resources away from efforts to determine the causes of autism.&lt;ref name=Offit/&gt; Since 2000, the thiomersal in child vaccines has been alleged to contribute to [[autism]], and thousands of parents in the United States have pursued legal compensation from a federal fund.&lt;ref name=Sugarman&gt;{{cite journal |journal=N Engl J Med |year=2007 |volume=357 |issue=13 |pages=1275–1277 |title=Cases in vaccine court—legal battles over vaccines and autism |author=Sugarman SD |pmid=17898095 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/13/1275 |doi=10.1056/NEJMp078168}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) committee favored rejecting any causal relationship between thiomersal-containing vaccines and autism.&lt;ref name=ISRC&gt;{{cite book |author=Immunization Safety Review Committee |title=Immunization Safety Review: Vaccines and Autism |publisher=The National Academies Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-309-09237-X |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Autism incidence rates increased steadily even after thiomersal was removed from childhood vaccines.&lt;ref name=Gerber/&gt; Currently there is no accepted scientific evidence that exposure to thiomersal is a factor in causing autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Can J Neurol Sci |year=2006 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=341–6 |title=Immunizations and autism: a review of the literature |author=Doja A, Roberts W |pmid=17168158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MMR vaccine===
{{Main|MMR vaccine controversy}}

In the UK, the [[MMR vaccine]] was the subject of controversy after publication in ''[[The Lancet]]'' of a 1998 paper by [[Andrew Wakefield]], ''et al.'' This article reported a study of 12 children mostly with onset [[autism spectrum disorder]]s soon after administration of the vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= [[Andrew Wakefield|Wakefield A]] |title= Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children |journal=Lancet |volume=351 |issue=9103 |pages=637–641 |year=1998 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11096-0 |pmid=9500320 |url=http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm |accessdate=2007-09-05 |author-separator= , |author2= Murch S |author3= Anthony A |display-authors= 3 |last4= Linnell |first4= J |last5= Casson |first5= DM |last6= Malik |first6= M |last7= Berelowitz |first7= M |last8= Dhillon |first8= AP |last9= Thomson |first9= MA}}{{Retracted paper|PMID 20137807|intentional=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a 1998 press conference, Wakefield suggested that giving children the vaccines in three separate doses would be safer than a single vaccination.

A 2007 study suggested that [[Raven's Progressive Matrices]] (RPM), a test of abstract reasoning, may be a better indicator of intelligence for autistic children than the more commonly used [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]] (WISC). Researchers suspected that the WISC relied too heavily on language to be an accurate measure of intelligence for autistic individuals. Their study revealed that the neurotypical children scored similarly on both tests, but the autistic children fared far better on the RPM than on the WISC. The RPM measures abstract, general and fluid reasoning, an ability autistic individuals have been presumed to lack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Dawson M, Soulières I, Gernsbacher MA, Mottron L |title= The level and nature of autistic intelligence |journal= Psychol Sci |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=657–662 |year=2007 |pmid=17680932 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01954.x |laysummary=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070803151245.htm |laysource=ScienceDaily |laydate=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 study found a similar effect, but to a much lesser degree and only for individuals with IQs less than 85 on the Wechsler scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Bölte S, Dziobek I, Poustka F |title= Brief report: the level and nature of autistic intelligence revisited |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |volume= 39|issue= 4|pages= 678–682|year=2008 |pmid=19052857 |doi=10.1007/s10803-008-0667-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Joint attention ==
{{confusing section|date=July 2012}}
[[Joint attention]] is the shared focus of two individuals on an object. It refers to a cluster of behaviors in one of two classes: a child's response to someone else pointing or shifting eye gaze, and a child seeking another's attention. Many joint-attention behaviors differ in children with autism: for example, [[eye contact]] is relatively absent or atypical.&lt;ref name=Bruinsma&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |year=2004 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=169–175 |title= Joint attention and children with Classic Autism: a review of the literature |author= Bruinsma Y, Koegel RL, Koegel LK |doi=10.1002/mrdd.20036 |pmid=15611988}}&lt;/ref&gt; These joint attention skills seem to be prerequisites for functional language development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |year=2007 |volume=120 |issue=5 |pages=1183–1215 |title= Identification and evaluation of children with autism spectrum disorders |author= Johnson CP, Myers SM, Council on Children with Disabilities |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-2361 |pmid=17967920 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/120/5/1183 |laysummary=http://aap.org/advocacy/releases/oct07autism.htm |laysource=AAP |laydate=2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been hypothesized that autistic children initiate joint attention perhaps even as often as their neurotypical peers, albeit in atypical ways, and that a parent should join an autistic child's focus of attention and try harder to notice the child's atypical requests for attention rather than insist on typical behavior from the child. The empirical data supporting the latter hypothesis has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Joint attention controversy:
