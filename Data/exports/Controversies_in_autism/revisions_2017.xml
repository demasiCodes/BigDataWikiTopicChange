Whether autism has mainly a [[heritability of autism|genetic or developmental cause]], and the degree of coincidence between autism and [[intellectual disability]], are all matters of current [[scientific controversy]] as well as inquiry.

[[Scientific consensus]] holds that [[vaccines]] do not cause autism, but popular rumors and an article in a respected scientific journal, ''[[The Lancet]]'', provoked concern among parents. The ''Lancet'' article was retracted for making false claims and because its author was found to be on the payroll of litigants against vaccine manufacturers.&lt;ref name=retraction/&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
{{Main article|Epidemiology of autism}}

Most recent reviews of [[epidemiology]] estimate a [[prevalence]] of one to two cases per 1,000 people for [[autism]], and about six per 1,000 for ASD;&lt;ref name=Newschaffer&gt;{{vcite journal|author=Newschaffer CJ, Croen LA, Daniels J ''et al.'' |author.= |title=The epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders |journal=Annu Rev Public Health |year=2007 |volume=28 |pages=235–58 |pmid=17367287 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144007 |url=http://idea.library.drexel.edu/bitstream/1860/2632/1/2006175339.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903024137/http://idea.library.drexel.edu/bitstream/1860/2632/1/2006175339.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; because of inadequate data, these numbers may underestimate ASD's true prevalence.&lt;ref name=Caronna&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Arch Dis Child |date=2008 |volume=93 |issue=6 |pages=518–23 |title=Autism spectrum disorders: clinical and research frontiers |author=Caronna EB, Milunsky JM, [[Helen Tager-Flusberg|Tager-Flusberg H]] |doi=10.1136/adc.2006.115337 |pmid=18305076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ASD averages a 4.3:1 male-to-female ratio.

==Genetics==
{{details|Heritability of autism}}

There is evidence that autism has a genetic component,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Dunham, Will | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN1623067120070219 | title = International study finds new autism genetic links |publisher = Reuters | date = 2007-02-19 | accessdate = 2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ongoing research focuses on finding the biomarkers that determine autistic [[phenotype]]s.

Genetics is viewed as an underlying factor because there is a statistical pattern for a significantly high risk to have another autistic child in families with an already affected child.&lt;ref&gt;http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/285/24/3093.full#ref-34&lt;/ref&gt; However, while some parents of autistic children are progressively also being diagnosed on the autism spectrum, at least some autistic children have apparently [[neurotypical]] parents. This suggests to some that genetics are either not a necessary cause or that they don't play a part in all cases of ASD, although it could also mean that the gene(s) responsible may be recessive or a [[Mutation|spontaneous mutation]]. The spectrum of autistic disorders is notable for its significant [[gender]] disparity, with the incidence of autism in males greatly exceeding the incidence in females. Whilst this could be evidence for a genetic theory, it has also been argued that male brains may be more vulnerable during early development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kimura, Doreen |date=2002-05-13 |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00018E9D-879D-1D06-8E49809EC588EEDF |title=Sex Differences in the Brain |publisher=Scientific American |accessdate=2008-02-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014175207/http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00018E9D-879D-1D06-8E49809EC588EEDF |archivedate=October 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vaccines==
Several controversial claims have been made with regard to [[autism]] and [[vaccinations]], leading notably to the [[MMR vaccine controversy]], the [[thiomersal controversy]], and the theory of [[vaccine overload]]. A 2011 journal article described the vaccine-autism connection as "the most damaging medical hoax of the last 100 years".&lt;ref name=Klaherty&gt;{{cite journal |author=Flaherty DK |title=The vaccine-autism connection: a public health crisis caused by unethical medical practices and fraudulent science |journal=Ann Pharmacother |volume=45 |issue=10 |pages=1302–4 |date=October 2011 |pmid=21917556 |doi=10.1345/aph.1Q318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thimerosal===
{{Main article|Thiomersal controversy}}

In 1999, the [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) and the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP) asked vaccine makers to remove the [[organomercury]] compound [[thiomersal]] (spelled "thimerosal" in the U.S.) from vaccines as quickly as possible, and thiomersal has been phased out of U.S. and European vaccines, except for some preparations of [[influenza vaccine]].&lt;ref name="Offit"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=N Engl J Med |year=2007 |volume=357 |issue=13 |pages=1278–1279 |title=Thimerosal and vaccines—a cautionary tale |author=Offit PA |doi=10.1056/NEJMp078187 |pmid=17898096 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/13/1278 |authorlink=Paul Offit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the FDA Modernization Act (FDAMA) of 1997, the FDA conducted a comprehensive review of the use of thimerosal in childhood vaccines. Conducted in 1999, this review found no evidence of harm from the use of thimerosal as a vaccine preservative, other than local hypersensitivity reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vaccine Safety &amp; Availability - Thimerosal in Vaccines|url = http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/UCM096228#tox|website = www.fda.gov|access-date = 2016-02-08|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC and the AAP followed the [[precautionary principle]], which assumes that there is no harm in exercising caution even if it later turns out to be unwarranted, but their 1999 action sparked confusion and controversy that has diverted attention and resources away from efforts to determine the causes of autism.&lt;ref name="Offit" /&gt; Since 2000, the thiomersal in child vaccines has been alleged to contribute to [[autism]], and thousands of parents in the United States have pursued legal compensation from a federal fund.&lt;ref name="Sugarman"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=N Engl J Med |year=2007 |volume=357 |issue=13 |pages=1275–1277 |title=Cases in vaccine court—legal battles over vaccines and autism |author=Sugarman SD |pmid=17898095 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/13/1275 |doi=10.1056/NEJMp078168}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) committee favored rejecting any causal relationship between thiomersal-containing vaccines and autism.&lt;ref name="ISRC"&gt;{{cite book |author=Immunization Safety Review Committee |title=Immunization Safety Review: Vaccines and Autism |publisher=The National Academies Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-309-09237-X |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Autism incidence rates increased steadily even after thiomersal was removed from childhood vaccines.&lt;ref name="Gerber"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|title=Vaccines and autism: a tale of shifting hypotheses|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/596476|dead-url=yes|journal=Clin Infect Dis|volume=48|issue=4|pages=456–461|doi=10.1086/596476|pmc=2908388|pmid=19128068|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120803021148/http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/596476|archive-date=2012-08-03|vauthors=Gerber JS, Offit PA|laysummary=http://www.idsociety.org/Content.aspx?id=13336|laysource=IDSA|laydate=2009-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently there is no accepted scientific evidence that exposure to thiomersal is a factor in causing autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Can J Neurol Sci |year=2006 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=341–6 |title=Immunizations and autism: a review of the literature |vauthors=Doja A, Roberts W |pmid=17168158 |doi=10.1017/s031716710000528x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine===
{{Main article|MMR vaccine controversy}}

In the UK, the [[MMR vaccine]] was the subject of controversy after publication in ''[[The Lancet]]'' of a 1998 paper by [[Andrew Wakefield]], ''et al.'' This article reported a study of 12 children mostly with onset [[autism spectrum disorder]]s soon after administration of the vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= [[Andrew Wakefield|Wakefield A]] |title= Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children |journal=Lancet |volume=351 |issue=9103 |pages=637–641 |year=1998 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11096-0 |pmid=9500320 |url=http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm |accessdate=2007-09-05 |name-list-format=vanc|author2= Murch S |author3= Anthony A |display-authors= 3 |last4= Linnell |first4= J |last5= Casson |first5= DM |last6= Malik |first6= M |last7= Berelowitz |first7= M |last8= Dhillon |first8= AP |last9= Thomson |first9= MA}}{{Retracted paper|{{PMID|20137807}}|intentional=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a 1998 press conference, Wakefield suggested that giving children the vaccines in three separate doses would be safer than a single vaccination.

=== Vaccine overload ===

{{details|Vaccine controversy#Vaccine overload}}

Following the belief that individual vaccines caused autism was the idea of vaccine overload, which claims that too many vaccines at once may overwhelm or weaken a child's immune system and lead to adverse effects.&lt;ref name="Hilton"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title='Combined vaccines are like a sudden onslaught to the body's [[immune system]]': parental concerns about vaccine 'overload' and 'immune-vulnerability'|journal=Vaccine|volume=24|issue=20|pages=4321–4327|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.03.003|pmid=16581162|vauthors=Hilton S, Petticrew M, Hunt K}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vaccine overload became popular after the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program accepted the case of nine year old [[Jon Poling|Hannah Poling]]. Hannah had encephalopathy putting her on the autism spectrum disorder, which was believed to have worsened after getting multiple vaccines at nineteen months old.&lt;ref name="Gerber" /&gt; There have been multiple cases reported similar to this one, which led to he belief that vaccine over load caused autism. However, scientific studies show that vaccines do not overwhelm the immune system.&lt;ref name="Gerber" /&gt; In fact, conservative estimates predict that the immune system can respond to thousands of viruses simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Gerber" /&gt; It is known that vaccines constitute only a tiny fraction of the pathogens already naturally encountered by a child in a typical year.&lt;ref name=Gerber/&gt; Common fevers and middle ear infections pose a much greater challenge to the immune system than vaccines do.&lt;ref&gt;Immune challenges:

The percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from 25% to 70%, a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing autistic intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Learning in autism |vauthors=Dawson M, Mottron L, Gernsbacher MA |title= Learning and Memory: A Comprehensive Reference |volume=2 |pages=759–72 |editor= Byrne JH (-in-chief), Roediger HL III (vol.) |publisher= Academic Press |year=2008 |doi=10.1016/B978-012370509-9.00152-2 |isbn=0-12-370504-5 |chapterurl=http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Dawson_AutisticLearning.pdf |accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[PDD-NOS]] the association with intellectual disability is much weaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chakrabarti S, Fombonne E |title= Pervasive developmental disorders in preschool children |journal=JAMA |year=2001 |volume=285 |issue=24 |pages=3093–3099 |pmid=11427137 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/285/24/3093 |doi= 10.1001/jama.285.24.3093}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnosis of Asperger's excludes clinically significant delays in mental or cognitive skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=DSM-IV-TR Diagnostical and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth edition text revision | publisher=American Psychiatric Association, Washington DC | year=2000 | pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 study suggested that [[Raven's Progressive Matrices]] (RPM), a test of abstract reasoning, may be a better indicator of intelligence for autistic children than the more commonly used [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]] (WISC). Researchers suspected that the WISC relied too heavily on language to be an accurate measure of intelligence for autistic individuals. Their study revealed that the neurotypical children scored similarly on both tests, but the autistic children fared far better on the RPM than on the WISC. The RPM measures abstract, general and fluid reasoning, an ability autistic individuals have been presumed to lack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dawson M, Soulières I, Gernsbacher MA, Mottron L |title= The level and nature of autistic intelligence |journal= Psychol Sci |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=657–662 |year=2007 |pmid=17680932 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01954.x |laysummary=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070803151245.htm |laysource=ScienceDaily |laydate=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 study found a similar effect, but to a much lesser degree and only for individuals with IQs less than 85 on the Wechsler scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bölte S, Dziobek I, Poustka F |title= Brief report: the level and nature of autistic intelligence revisited |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |volume= 39|issue= 4|pages= 678–682|year=2008 |pmid=19052857 |doi=10.1007/s10803-008-0667-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facilitated Communication ==
{{Further information|Facilitated communication}}
Facilitated communication gained immediate attention and was used by many hopeful parents of individuals with autism when it was first introduced during the early 1990s by [[Douglas Biklen]], a professor at Syracuse University.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soe.syr.edu/centers_institutes/institute_communication_inclusion/default.aspx|title=Institute on Communication and Inclusion|last=|first=|date=|website=Syracuse University School of Education|access-date=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, controversies shortly arose after several reports of sexual abuse were made by individuals using the keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stock|first=Barbara|date=2011-10-25|title=Mixed Messages: Validity and Ethics of Facilitated Communication|url=http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/1725|journal=Disability Studies Quarterly|language=en|volume=31|issue=4|issn=2159-8371}}&lt;/ref&gt; There became a heightened concern regarding who was actually typing the messages – the individual with autism or the facilitator?

Similar studies were conducted starting in 1993 that argued facilitated communication was an ineffective technique. One reason was that autistic individuals were not able to communicate any better than they would have independently.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bebko1 Bryson2|first=Perry1 S2|date=1996|title=Multiple Method Validation Study of Facilitated Communication|url=|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disabilities|volume=26|pages=19–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason was because facilitators’ seemed to have an influence on the messages being typed by individuals with autism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1994, the American Psychological Association officially announced that there was “no scientifically demonstrated support for its efficacy." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/research/action/facilitated.aspx|title=Facilitated Communication: Sifting the Psychological Wheat from the Chaff|last=|first=|date=November 20, 2003|website=American Psychological Association|language=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120060710/http://www.apa.org/research/action/facilitated.aspx|archive-date=2010-01-20|dead-url=yes|access-date=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study done in 2014 examined the role of facilitators in eleven cases where children have been using facilitated communication for more than one year. They agreed that facilitated communication was not valid because the children with autism performed better on test questions only when the facilitator was also aware of the questions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saloviita1 Leppanen2 Ojalammi3|first=Timo1 Marjatta2 Ulla3|date=2014|title=Authorship in Communicated Facilitation: An Analysis of 11 Cases|url=|journal=Augmentative and Alternative Communication Journal|volume=30|pages=213–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the facilitator did not know the test questions or the keyboard was out of sight, those with autism were not able to answer the questions either, suggesting that facilitators unconsciously play a role in the messages being typed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Much of the empirical research done during the early 1990s up to now argue that facilitated communication is an invalid alternative treatment to autism.

Despite what the scientific community claims, there are still many people using facilitated communication. In fact, Syracuse University still offers a program called Institute on Communication and Inclusion that trains facilitators to use this technique, what they now call supported typing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They claim that new methods such as video-eye tracking, linguistics analysis, evidence of speech before and during typing, and message passing have demonstrated that it is the individual with autism doing the typing, not the facilitator.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A study done in 2014 stated that the changes made to facilitated communication since its introduction, such as the use of multiple facilitators for one individual, has made this technique more valid such that some individuals with autism have been able to type with zero support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cardinal1 Falvey1|first=Donald1 Mary2|date=2014|title=The Maturing of Facilitated Communication: A Means Toward Independent Communication|url=|journal=Research and Practice for Persons with Severe Disabilities Journal|volume=39|pages=189–194}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Autism National Committee announced a position statement that approves the use of facilitated communication as it “has already proven to be profoundly beneficial in the lives of many people by opening the doors to reliable, trusted, and respected symbolic communication for the first time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.autcom.org/|title=The Autism National Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=www.autcom.org|access-date=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[autism rights movement]] (ARM) is a [[social movement]] that encourages autistic people, their caregivers and society to adopt a position of neurodiversity, accepting autism as a variation in functioning rather than a [[mental disorder]] to be cured.&lt;ref name="Solomon"&gt;{{cite news |work=New York |title=The autism rights movement |last=Solomon |first=Andrew |date=2008-05-25 |accessdate=2008-05-27 |url=http://nymag.com/news/features/47225/| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080527025140/http://nymag.com/news/features/47225/| archivedate= 27 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ARM advocates a variety of goals including a greater acceptance of autistic behaviors;&lt;ref name=AAP&gt;[http://www.taaproject.com/about-us/mission-statement/ Mission Statement.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421054344/http://www.taaproject.com/about-us/mission-statement/ |date=2013-04-21 }} Autism Acceptance Project.

Autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the human genome. This perspective is distinct from two other likewise distinct views: (1) the mainstream perspective that autism is caused by a genetic defect and should be addressed by targeting the autism gene(s) and (2) the perspective that autism is caused by environmental factors like vaccines and pollution and could be cured by addressing environmental causes.&lt;ref name="Solomon"/&gt;

===Anti-cure perspective===
"Curing" or "treating" autism is a [[Ethical challenges to autism treatment|controversial]] and [[politicized issue]]. Doctors and scientists are not sure of the [[causes of autism|cause(s) of autism]] yet many organizations like [[Autism Research Institute]] and [[Autism Speaks]] advocate researching a cure. Members of the various autism rights organizations view autism as a way of life rather than as a disease and thus advocate acceptance over a search for a cure.&lt;ref name=Harmon&gt;Harmon, Amy.

The ''"anti-cure perspective"'' endorsed by the movement is a view that [[autism spectrum|autism]] is not a disorder, but a normal occurrence—an alternate variation in brain wiring or a less common expression of the human genome.&lt;ref name="Harmon"/&gt; Advocates of this perspective believe that autism is a unique way of being that should be validated, supported and appreciated rather than shunned, discriminated against or eliminated.&lt;ref name="Harmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gal&gt;{{cite news |author=Gal L |title=Who says autism's a disease? |work=Haaretz |date=2007-06-28 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/876283.html |accessdate=2007-07-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070701201936/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/876283.html| archivedate= 1 July 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe quirks and uniqueness of autistic individuals should be tolerated as the differences of any minority group should be tolerated and that efforts to eliminate autism should not be compared, for example, to curing cancer but instead to the antiquated notion of curing [[left-handedness]].&lt;ref name="Harmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dawson&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.autistics.org/library/dawson.html |title=In Support of Michelle Dawson and Her Work |publisher=Autistics.org |accessdate=2012-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215181832/http://archive.autistics.org/library/dawson.html |archivedate=2012-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ARM is a part of the larger disability rights movement, and as such acknowledges the social model of disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Waltz, M |title=Autism: A Social and Medical History |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=London |year=2013 |isbn=0-230-52750-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the model, struggles faced by autistic people are viewed as discrimination rather than deficiencies.

[[John Elder Robison]] was a discussant for the Autism Social, Legal, and Ethical Research Special Interest Group at the 2014 International Meeting for Autism Research (IMFAR). He ended up taking the group to task, stating that the autism science community is headed for disaster if it does not change course on several factors – and noting for context the larger size of the US autistic community in proportion to other minority groups such as Jewish or Native American communities.

Robison asserted that autistic people need to be the ones providing oversight and governance for autism research. He condemned the use of words like "cure". He pointed out that researchers' explicit or implicit efforts to eradicate autistic people are a formula for disaster and need to stop. He also affirmed that memoirs and narratives written by autistic people are more trustworthy than writing about autism by nonautistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thinkingautismguide.com/2014/05/john-robison-at-imfar-on-autism-rights.html John Robison at IMFAR: On Autism Rights, Ethics, &amp; Priorities]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the 2013 fifth revision of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-5]]) has more specificity, it also has reports of more limited sensitivity. Due to the changes to the DSM and the lessening of sensitivity, there is the possibility that individuals who were diagnosed with [[autistic spectrum]] disorders (ASD) using the fourth revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) will not receive the same diagnosis with the DSM-5.

From the 933 individuals that were evaluated, 39 percent of the samples that were diagnosed with an ASD using the DSM-IV-TR criteria did not meet the DSM-5 criteria for that disorder.{{MEDRS|date=May 2015}}&lt;ref name=Barton&gt;{{primary-source inline|date=May 2015}} Barton, M. L., Robins, D. L., Jashar, D., Brennan, L., &amp; Fein, D. (2013). Sensitivity and specificity of proposed DSM-5 criteria for Autism spectrum disorder in toddlers. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 43(5), 1184-1195. doi:10.1007/s10803-013-1817-8 {{PMID|23543293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the DSM-5 criteria no longer classified them with having ASD, deeming them without a diagnosis. It was likely that individuals that exhibited higher cognitive functioning and had other disorders, such as Asperger's or [[pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified]] (PDD-NOS), were completely excluded from the criteria. Also, it is more probable that younger children who do not exhibit the entirety of the symptoms and characteristics of ASD are more at risk of being excluded by the new criteria since they could have Asperger's as Asperger's disorder does not usually show symptoms until later in childhood. Because the onset age is different in Asperger's from autism, grouping together the disorders does not typically allow or distinguish the differentiating ages of onset, which is problematic in diagnosing. It is evident, through the various studies, that the amount of people being diagnosed will be significantly diminished as well, which is prominently due to the DSM-5's new criteria.&lt;ref name=Barton/&gt;
