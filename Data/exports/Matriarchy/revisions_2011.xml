A '''matriarchy''' is a [[society]] in which [[female]]s, especially [[mother]]s, have the central roles of political [[leadership]] and  moral [[authority]]. It is also sometimes called a '''gynocratic'''{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} or '''gynocentric'''{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} society.
Although the Iroquois people continue to exist and they continue to present a society in which mothers exercise central moral and political roles, &lt;ref&gt;Doug George-Kanentiio, Iroquois Culture &amp; Commentary (New Mexico: Clear Light Publishers, 2000, pp.53-55.&lt;/ref&gt;some anthropologists and authors hold that there are no known societies that are unambiguously matriarchal,&lt;ref&gt;Steven Goldberg, ''[[The Inevitability of Patriarchy]]'', (William Morrow &amp; Company, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joan Bamberger,'The Myth of Matriarchy: Why Men Rule in Primitive Society', in M Rosaldo and L Lamphere, ''Women, Culture, and Society'', (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1974), pp. 263-280.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Brown (anthropologist)|Donald E.

'Matriarchy' ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2007."&lt;/ref&gt; There are also [[matrilinear]], [[matrilocal]], and [[Avunculism|avunculocal]] societies, especially among [[indigenous peoples]] of [[indigenous peoples of Asia|Asia]] and [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.second-congress-matriarchal-studies.com/goettnerabendroth.html Modern Matriarchal Studies Definitions, Scope and Topicality - Heide Goettner-Abendroth]&lt;/ref&gt; such as those of the  [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[E De people|E De (Rhade)]], [[Mosuo]], [[Berber people|Berbers]] and [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] and, in [[Europe]], e.g., [[Sardinian people]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=20544306 ''LA FAMIGLIA E LA DONNA IN SARDEGNA ANNOTAZIONI DI STUDIO''] 2005, vol. 71, no3, pp. 487-498 [12 page(s) (article)] (dissem.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contusu.it/personaggi-e-storia-mainmenu-31/229-sardegna-matriarcale.html ''Sardegna matriarcale''] (in italian)&lt;/ref&gt;
Strongly matrilocal societies sometimes are referred to as '''matrifocal''', and there is some debate concerning the terminological delineation between matrifocality and matriarchy. Even in patriarchical systems of [[male-preference primogeniture]], there may occasionally be [[queen regnant|queens regnant]], as in the case of [[Elizabeth I of England]].

In 19th century Western scholarship, the hypothesis of matriarchy representing an early stage of human development—now mostly lost in prehistory, with the exception of some "[[Primitive culture|primitive]]" societies—enjoyed popularity. The hypothesis survived into the 20th century and was notably advanced in the context of [[feminism]] and especially [[second wave feminism]], but this hypothesis of matriarchy as having been an early stage of human development is mostly discredited today, most experts saying that it never existed.&lt;ref&gt;"The view of matriarchy as constituting a stage of cultural development now is generally discredited. Furthermore, the consensus among modern anthropologists and sociologists is that a strictly matriarchal society never existed." 'Matriarchy', ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Contemporary author Doug George-Kanentiio, in his chapter on the Iroquois family subtitled, "Women are the Center of Iroquois Life," explains, "In our society, women are the center of all things. Nature, we believe, has given women the ability to create; therefore it is only natural that women be in positions of power to protect this function....We traced our clans through women; a child born into the world assumed the clan membership of its mother. Our young women were expected to be physically strong....The young women received formal instruction intraditional planting....Since the Iroquois were absolutely dependent upon the crops they grew, whoever controlled this vital activity wielded great power within our communities. It was our belief that since women were the givers of life they naturally regulated the feeding of our people....In all countries, real wealth stems from the control of land and its resources. Our Iroquois philosophers knew this as well as we knew natural law. To us it made sense for women to control the land since they wee far more ensitive to the rhythms of the Mother Earth. We did not own the lad but were cutodians of it. Our women decided any and all issues involving territory, including where a community was to be built and how land was to be used....In our political system, we mandated full equality. Our leaders were selected by a caucus of women before the appointments were subject to popular review....Our traditional governments are composed of an equal number of men and women. The men are chiefs and the women clanmothers....As leaders, the women closely monitor the actions of the men and retain the right to veto any law they deem inappropriate....Our women not only hold the reigns of political and economic power, they also have the right to determine all issues involving the taking of human life. Declarations of war had to be approved by the women, while treaties of peace were subject to their deliberations."&lt;ref&gt;Doug George-Kanentiio, Iroquois Culture &amp; Commentary, New Mexico, Clear Light Publishers, 2000, pp. 53-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Answer is Matriarchy," Barbara Love and Elizabeth Shanklin write, "When we hear the word 'matriarchy', we are conditioned to a number of responses: that matriarchy refers to the past and that matriarchies have never existed; that matriarchy is a hopeless fantasy of female domination, of mothers dominating children, of women being cruel to men..Conditioning us negatively to matriarchy is, of course, in the interests of patriarchs. We are made to feel that patriarchy is natural; we are less likely to question it, and less likely to direct our energies to ending it."&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Love and Elizabeth Shanklin, "The Answer is Matriarchy,"  Mothering: Essays in Feminist Theory, edited by Joyce Trebilcot (New Jersey: Rowman &amp; Allanheld, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions and etymology ==
The word ''matriarchy'' is often interpreted to mean the  opposite of ''[[patriarchy]]''. from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''{{lang|grc-Latn|[[:wikt:μήτηρ|matēr]]}}'' 'mother' and ''{{lang|grc-Latn|[[:wikt:-archy|archein]]}}'' 'to rule'. [[Margot Adler]] wrote, "[l]iterally, ... ["''matriarchy''"] means government by mothers, or more broadly, government and power in the hands of women."&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Margot, ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America]]'' (N.Y.: Penguin Books, 2006 (ISBN 0 14 30.3819 2)), p. 193 (previous editions in 1979, 1986, &amp; 1997) (italics so in original) (author then N.Y. Bureau Chief for [[NPR|National Public Radio]]).&lt;/ref&gt; "'Matriarchy' can be thought of ... as a shorthand description for any society in which women's power is equal or superior to men's and in which the culture centers around values and life events described as 'feminine.'"&lt;ref&gt;Eller, Cynthia, ''The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory: Why an Invented Past Won't Give Women a Future'' (Boston, Mass.: Beacon Press, 2000 (ISBN 0-8070-6792-X)), pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Marxist tradition, it usually refers to a preclass society "where women and men share equally in production and power."&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Margot, ''Drawing Down the Moon'' (2006), ''op. cit.'', p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Some consider the term as not being parallel to ''patriarchy'', because it is not always defined in the same fashion differing only for gender.&lt;ref&gt;Eller, Cynthia, ''Living in the Lap of the Goddess: The Feminist Spirituality Movement in America'' (Boston, Mass.: Beacon Press, 1995 (ISBN 0-8070-6507-2)), pp. 161–162 &amp; 184 &amp; n. 84 (author, with doctorate in religion from Univ. of Southern Calif., taught at Yale Divinity School &amp; Fairleigh Dickinson Univ.) (p. 184 n. 84 probably citing Spretnak, Charlene, ed., ''Politics of Women's Spirituality: Essays on the Rise of Spiritual Power Within the Feminist Movement'' (Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor Books, 1982), p. xiii (Spretnak, Charlene, ''Introduction'')).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goettner-Abendroth, Heide, ed., ''Societies of Peace: Matriarchies Past, Present and Future: Selected Papers: First World Congress on Matriarchal Studies, 2003 [/] Second World Congress on Matriarchal Studies, 2005'' (Toronto, Ont., Canada: Inanna Publications &amp; Educ. (York Univ.), 2009 (ISBN 978-0-9782233-5-9)), pp. 1–2 (ed. a/k/a Heide Göttner-Abendroth) (ed. founder Modern Matriachal Studies &amp; HAGIA &amp; was visiting prof., [[Université de Montréal|Univ. of Montreal]] &amp; [[University of Innsbruck|Univ. of Innsbruck (Austria)]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Matriarchy is also the public formation in which the woman occupies the ruling position in a family (a primary cell of society). Matriarchy has even been found where a quarter of Black families in the U.S. were headed by single women;&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, Josephine, ''Feminist Theory: The Intellectual Traditions'' (N.Y.: Continuum, 3d ed. 2000 (ISBN 0-8264-1248-3)), p. 171 (author prof. Eng., Univ. of Maine), citing [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan|Moynihan, Daniel]], ''The Negro Family: The Case for National Action'' (1965) ("In this analysis Moynihan asserted that since a fourth of black families were headed by single women, black society was a matriarchy .... [and t]his situation undermined the confidence and 'manhood' of black men, and therefore prevented their competing successfully in the white work world.") and citing [[bell hooks|hooks, bell]], either ''Ain't I a Woman: Black Women and Feminism'' (Boston: South End, 1981) or ''Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center'' (Boston: South End, 1984) (probably former), pp. 181–187 ("[f]reedom came to be seen by some black militants as a liberation from the oppression caused by black women"), ''id.'', hooks, bell, pp. 180–181 ("many black men 'absorbed' the Moynihan ideology, and this misogyny itself became absorbed into the black freedom movement" and included this, "Moynihan's view", as a case of "American neo-Freudian revisionism where women who evidenced the slightest degree of independence were perceived as 'castrating' threats to the male identity"), and see ''id.'', hooks, bell, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; thus, families composing a substantial minority of a substantial minority could be enough for the latter to constitute a matriarchy within a larger nonmatriarchal society. In addition, some authors depart from the premise of a mother-child dyad as the core of a human group where the grandmother was the central ancestress with her children and grandchildren clustered around her in an extended family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/books?id=reU63yfgrWIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;source=gbs_slider_thumb#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true ''Goddesses and the divine feminine: a Western religious history'', Rosemary Radford Ruether, p. 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to journalist [[Margot Adler]], "[a] number of feminists note that few definitions of the word ["''matriarchy''"], despite its literal meaning, include any concept of power, and they suggest that centuries of oppression have made it impossible for women to conceive of themselves with such power."&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Margot, ''Drawing Down the Moon'' (2006), ''op. cit.'', p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

Etymologically, according to the [[OED]], the word ''matriarchy'' is first attested in 1885, building on an earlier ''matriarch'', formed in analogy to [[patriarch]], already in use in the early 17th century. By contrast, ''[[:wikt:gynecocracy|gynæcocracy]]'', meaning 'rule of women', has been in use since the 17th century, building on the Greek word {{lang|grc|γυναικοκρατία}} found in [[Aristotle]] and [[Plutarch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3D%237148 γυναικοκρατία] Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2323035 γυ^ναικο-κρα^τέομαι] Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon&lt;/ref&gt;

The Matriarchal Studies school led by [[Heide Göttner-Abendroth]] calls for a more inclusive redefinition of the term: Göttner-Abendroth defines ''Modern Matriarchal Studies'' as the "investigation and presentation of non-patriarchal societies", effectively defining ''matriarchy'' as "non-patriarchy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.second-congress-matriarchal-studies.com/goettnerabendroth.html Introduction] to the "Second World Congress on Matriarchal Studies".&lt;/ref&gt; She has also defined ''matriarchy'' as characterized by the sharing of power equally between the two genders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://matriarchy.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=143&amp;Itemid=83 DeMott, Tom, ''The Investigator'' (review of Bennholdt-Thomsen, Veronika, Cornelia Giebeler, Brigitte Holzer, &amp; Marina Meneses, ''Juchitán, City of Women'' (Mexico: Consejo Editorial, 1994))], as accessed Feb. 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Peggy Reeves Sanday (2004) favors redefining and reintroducing the word ''matriarchy'', especially in reference to contemporary matrilineal societies such as the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]].

In "The Answer is Matriarchy," Barbara Love and Elizabeth Shanklin, write, "Toward a Definition of Matriarchy, By 'matriarchy,' we mean a nonalienated society: a society in which women, those who produce the next generation, define motherhood, determine the conditions of motherhood, and determine the environment in which the next generation is reared."&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Love and Elizabeth Shanklin, "The Answer is Matriarchy," in Mothering: Essays in Feminist Theory, edited by Joyce Trebilcot (New Jersey: Rowman &amp; Allenheld, 1983), pp. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

While these words all share that principal meaning, they differ a little in their additional meanings, so that ''gynecocracy'' also means 'women's social supremacy',&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged'', ''op. cit.'', entry ''gynecocracy''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''gynaecocracy'' also means 'government by one woman', 'female dominance', and, derogatorily, 'petticoat government',&lt;ref&gt;''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', ''op. cit.'', entry ''gynaecocracy''.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''gynocracy'' also means 'women as the ruling class'.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', ''op. cit.'', entry ''gynocracy''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gyneocracy'' is rarely used in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', ''op. cit.'', entry ''gyneocracy''.&lt;/ref&gt; None of these definitions are limited to mothers.

Some matriarchies have been described by historian [[Bertha Diener|Helen Diner]] as "a strong gynocracy"&lt;ref name="MothersAmazons-1965-p137"&gt;Diner, Helen, ed. &amp; trans. John Philip Lundin, ''Mothers and Amazons: The First Feminine History of Culture'' (N.Y.: Julian Press, 1965) ("the German edition of her work ... appeared in the early 1930s" under the author's pseudonym Sir Galahad, per ''id.'', p. vi (Campbell, Joseph, ''Introduction'' (N.Y.: Aug., 1965)) (author "Viennese society woman ... authored several books under the pseudonym Sir Galahad", ''id.'', dust jacket, rear flap (''The Author'')) (this work trans. from German, per ''id.'', dust jacket, rear flap (''The Author''))), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; and "women monopolizing government"&lt;ref&gt;Diner, Helen, ''Mothers and Amazons'' (trans. 1965 (original early 1930s)), ''op. cit.'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; and she described matriarchal [[Amazons]] as "an extreme, feminist wing"&lt;ref&gt;Diner, Helen, ''Mothers and Amazons'' (trans. 1965 (original 1930s)), ''op. cit.'', p. 123 and see p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; of humanity and that North African women "ruled the country politically,"&lt;ref name="MothersAmazons-1965-p137" /&gt; and, according to Margot Adler, Helen Diner "envision[ed] a dominance matriarchy".&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Margot, ''Drawing Down the Moon'' (2006), ''op. cit.'', p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gynocentrism ===
''[[Gynocentrism]]'' (simplified by using the reduced prefix ''gyno-'' for  ''gynæco-'') is the 'dominant or exclusive focus on women', is opposed to [[androcentrism]], and "invert[s] ... the privilege of the ... [male/female] binary ... [some feminists] arguing for 'the superiority of values embodied in traditionally female experience'".&lt;ref&gt;Latter quotation: Davis, Debra Diane, ''Breaking Up [at] Totality: A Rhetoric of Laughter'' (Carbondale: Southern Ill. Univ. Press, 2000 (ISBN 0-8093-2228-5)), p. 137 (&amp; see pp. 136–137 &amp; 143) (brackets in title so in original) &amp; quoting Young, Iris M., ''Humanism, Gynocentrism, and Feminist Politics.'', in ''Women's Studies International Forum'', 8 (1985), p. 173 (author D. Diane Davis asst. prof. rhetoric, Univ. of Iowa).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Matrifocality and matricentrism ===
Due to a lack of a clear and consistent definition of the word ''matriarchy'', several anthropologists have begun to use the term ''matrifocality.'' The terms ''matrifocal'' and ''matricentric'', 'having a mother as head of the family or household', were first used in the mid 20th century.

Matrifocal societies are those in which women, especially mothers, occupy a central position. The term does not necessarily imply domination by women or mothers.&lt;ref name = "smith"/&gt; Anthropologist R. L. Smith (2002) refers to ''matrifocality'' as the kinship structure of a social system where the mothers assume structural prominence.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;Smith R.T. (2002) Matrifocality, in International encyclopedia of the social and behavioral sciences (eds) Smelser &amp; Baltes, vol 14, pp 9416.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nair]] community in [[Kerala]] and the [[Bunt (community)|Bunt]] community in [[Tulunadu]] in [[South India]] are prime examples of matrifocality. This can be attributed to the fact that if males were largely warriors by profession, a community was bound to lose male members at youth, leading to a situation where the females assumed the role of running the family.

=== Matristic ===
Feminist scholars and archeologists such as [[Marija Gimbutas]], [[Gerda Lerner]], and [[Riane Eisler]]&lt;ref&gt;Eisler, Riane, ''The Chalice and the Blade'', as cited at the [http://www.rianeeisler.com/chalice.htm author's website], as accessed Jan. 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; describe their notion of a "woman-centered" society surrounding [[Mother Goddess]] worship throughout prehistory ([[Paleolithic]] and [[Neolithic Europe]]) and ancient civilizations, by using the term ''matristic'' rather than ''matriarchal''.

=== Matrilineality ===

The [[Iroquois|Iroquois Confederacy or League]], combining five to six American Indian nations or tribes before the [[United States|U.S.]] became a nation, operated by [[Great Law of Peace|The Great Binding Law of Peace]], a constitution by which women participated in the League's political decision-making, including deciding whether to proceed to war,&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Renée E., ''Iroquois Great Law of Peace and the United States Constitution: How the Founding Fathers Ignored the Clan Mothers'', in ''American Indian Law Review'', vol. 16, no. 2, pp. 497-531, esp. pp. 498-509 (© author 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; through what may have been a matriarchy&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Renée, ''Iroquois Great Law of Peace and the United States Constitution'', in ''American Indian Law Review'', ''op. cit.'', pp. 506–507.&lt;/ref&gt; or "'gyneocracy'".&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Renée, ''Iroquois Great Law of Peace and the United States Constitution'', in ''American Indian Law Review'', ''op. cit.'', p. 505 &amp; p. 506 n. 38, quoting Carr, L., ''The Social and Political Position of Women Among the Huron-Iroquois Tribes, Report of the Peabody Museum of American Archaeology'', p. 223 (1884).&lt;/ref&gt; The dates of this constitution's operation are unknown: the League was formed in approximately [[1000]]–[[1450]], but the constitution was oral until written in about 1880.&lt;ref name="IroquoisGreatLawUSConst-p498"&gt;Jacobs, Renée, ''Iroquois Great Law of Peace and the United States Constitution'', in ''American Indian Law Review'', ''op. cit.'', p. 498 &amp; n. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The League still exists.

=== 19th century ===
The notion of matriarchy was defined by Joseph-Francois Lafitau (1681–1746), who first named it "ginecocratie".

The controversy surrounding prehistoric or "primal" matriarchy began in reaction to the book by [[Johann Jakob Bachofen]] ''Mother Right: An Investigation of the Religious and Juridical Character of Matriarchy in the Ancient World'' in 1861. Several generations of ethnologists were inspired by his pseudo-evolutionary theory of archaic matriarchy. Following him and [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], several generations of scholars, usually arguing from known myths or oral traditions and examination of Neolithic female cult-figures, suggested that many ancient societies might have been matriarchal, or even that there existed a wide-ranging matriarchal society prior to the ancient cultures of which we are aware.

The concept was further investigated by [[Lewis H. Morgan|Lewis H. Morgan, LL. D]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/morgan-lewis/ancient-society/ancient-society.zip L. Morgan, "Ancient Society Or Researches in the Lines of Human Progress from Savagery through Barbarism to Civilization"]&lt;/ref&gt; Many researchers studied the phenomenon of matriarchy afterward, but the basis was laid by the classics of sociology. In their works Bachofen and Lewis Morgan used such terms and expressions as mother-right, female rule, gyneocracy, and female authority. All these terms meant the same: the rule by females (mother or wife).

The notion of a "woman-centered" society was developed by [[J. J. Bachofen]], whose three-volume ''Myth, religion, and mother right'' (1861) impacted the way classicists such as [[Jane Ellen Harrison|Jane Harrison]], [[Sir Arthur Evans]], [[Walter Burkert]], and [[James Mellaart]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/books?id=reU63yfgrWIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;source=gbs_slider_thumb#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true ''Goddesses and the divine feminine: a Western religious history'', Rosemary Radford Ruether, p. 15]&lt;/ref&gt; looked at the evidence of [[matriarchal religion]] in pre-Hellenic societies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.br/books?id=3qhQuWPNUckC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=bachofen&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;ei=NEFQTMugHsT68AbzvImIAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true ''Myth, religion, and mother right'']&lt;/ref&gt;

A claim of "matriarchy" in the ancient Near East is also found  in ''The Cambridge Ancient History'' (1975):&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=n1TmVvMwmo4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA400&amp;lpg=RA1-PA400&amp;dq=pinikir+elam+matriarchy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=f-_I4x7lfF&amp;sig=nxE0eb-3ITTlR8jQXO3YOFiTtRQ&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;ei=2v9ES-SZIYT34AaGstmqCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=matriarchy&amp;f=false ''The Cambridge Ancient History'', volumes 1-4, p.400]&lt;/ref&gt; "the predominance of a supreme goddess is probably a reflection from the practice of matriarchy which at all times characterized Elamite civilization to a greater or lesser degree".

The following excerpts from Lewis Morgan's "Ancient Society" will explain the use of the terms: "In a work of vast research, Bachofen has collected and discussed the evidence of female authority, mother-right, and of female rule, gynecocracy."

"Common lands and joint tillage would lead to joint-tenant houses and communism in living; so that gyneocracy seems to require for its creation, descent in the female line. Women thus entrenched in large households, supplied from common stores, in which their own gens so largely predominated in numbers, would produce the phenomena of mother right and gyneocracy, which Bachofen has detected and traced with the aid of fragments of history and of tradition."

Although Bachofen and Lewis Morgan confined the "mother right" inside households, it was the basis of female influence upon the whole society. The authors of the classics never thought that ''gyneocracy'' could mean 'female government' in politics. They were aware of the fact that the sexual structure of government had no relation to domestic rule and to roles of both sexes.

The 19th-century belief that matriarchal societies existed, a belief now abandoned among most scholars, was due to the transmission of "economic and social power ... through kinship lines"&lt;ref name="LivingLapGoddess-p152-158-161"&gt;Eller, Cynthia, ''Living in the Lap of the Goddess'', ''op. cit.'', p. 152 and see pp. 158–161.&lt;/ref&gt; so that "in a matrilineal society all power would be channeled through women. Women may not have retained all power and authority in such societies ..., but they would have been in a position to control and dispense power."&lt;ref name="LivingLapGoddess-p152-158-161" /&gt;

[[Friedrich Engels]], among others studying historical groups, formed the notion that some contemporary primitive peoples did not grasp the link between [[sexual intercourse]] and [[pregnancy]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Research indicated that sexual intercourse occurred from early ages and pregnancy only occurred much later, seemingly unrelated to the sexual activity.  He proposed that these cultures had no clear notion of [[paternity (biology and medicine)|paternity]], according to this [[hypothesis]]; women produced children mysteriously, without necessary links to the man or men with whom they had sex. When realization of paternity occurred, according to the hypothesis, men acted to claim a power to monopolize women and claim their offspring as possessions and patriarchy began.

=== 20th century ===
Ethnographer [[Bronisław Malinowski]], from the [[London School of Economics]], lived among aborigines of the Trobriand Islands (Western Melanesia) and studied their society in 1914-1918. In his book ''Argonauts Of The Western Pacific'',&lt;ref name="ArgonautsWPac-arcorg"&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/argonautsofthewe032976mbp/argonautsofthewe032976mbp_djvu.txt "Argonauts Of The Western Pacific"]&lt;/ref&gt; B. Malinowski pointed at a matrilineal construction of the islanders' societies and at a high female position:

"Their system of kinship is matrilineal, and women hold a very good position, and wield great influence."&lt;ref name="ArgonautsWPac-c1"&gt;Malinowski, Bronisław, ''Argonauts Of The Western Pacific'', ''op. cit.'', ch. I.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Trobrianders are matrilineal, that is, in tracing descent and settling inheritance, they follow the maternal line. A child belongs to the clan and village community of its mother, and wealth, as well as social position, are inherited, not from father to son, but from maternal uncle to nephew."&lt;ref name="ArgonautsWPac-c2"&gt;Malinowski, Bronisław, ''Argonauts Of The Western Pacific'', ''op. cit.'', ch. II.&lt;/ref&gt;

"As regards kinship, the main thing to be remembered is that the natives are matrilineal, and that the succession of rank, membership in all the social groups, and the inheritance of possessions descend in the maternal line."&lt;ref name="ArgonautsWPac-c2" /&gt;

Property was succeeded inside the mother-line: "The ownership of trees in the village grove and ownership in garden plots is ceded by the father to his son during the lifetime of the former. At his death, it often has to be returned to the man's rightful heirs, that is, his sister's children."&lt;ref name="ArgonautsWPac-c2" /&gt;

A man had a life-long obligation to work for women and their relatives in that society: "They entail a life-long obligation of every man to work for his kinswomen and their families. When a boy begins to garden, he does it for his mother. When his sisters grow up and marry, he works for them. If he has neither mother nor sisters, his nearest female blood relation will claim the proceeds of his labour".&lt;ref name="ArgonautsWPac-c6"&gt;Malinowski, Bronisław, ''Argonauts Of The Western Pacific'', ''op. cit.'', ch. VI.&lt;/ref&gt;

By studying several different tribes of the Western Pacific (employing the method of comparison, popular in ethnography), Malinowski gave confirmations of Lewis Morgan's idea that matriarchy (gyneocracy)&lt;ref&gt;[[Eleanor Leacock|Leacock, Eleanor]], ''Women's Status in Egalitarian Society: Implications for Social Evolution'', in ''Current Anthropology'', vol. 33, no. 1, supp. ''Inquiry and Debate in the Human Sciences: Contributions from Current Anthropology, 1960–1990'' (Feb., [[1992]] (ISSN 00113204 &amp; E-ISSN 15375382)), p. 232 (essay originally appeared in ''Current Anthropology'', vol. 19, no. 2 (Jun., [[1978]])) (author Eleanor Leacock prof. anthro., [[City College of New York|City Coll.]] &amp; [[CUNY Graduate Center|Grad. Faculty of City Univ. of N.Y.]]).&lt;/ref&gt; was a common feature of primitive societies at early stages, and that female rule needed matrilineality for its existence. He also confirmed that matrilineality often goes hand in hand with promiscuous free love (a fact that was discovered{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} by Bachofen).

According to B. Malinowski:

"As a rule, amongst natives, a high position of women is associated with sex laxity."&lt;ref name="ArgonautsWPac"&gt;Malinowski, Bronisław, ''Argonauts Of The Western Pacific'', ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

"The sexual life of these natives [the Southern Massim tribe] is extremely lax. Even when we remember the very free standard of sex morals in the Melanesian tribes of New Guinea, such as the Motu or the Mailu, we still find these natives exceedingly loose in such matters. Certain reserves and appearances which are usually kept up in other tribes, are here completely abandoned. As is probably the case in many communities where sex morals are lax, there is a complete absence of unnatural practices and sex perversions. Marriage is concluded as the natural end of a long and lasting liaison."&lt;ref name="ArgonautsWPac" /&gt;

"[The Trobrianders'] sexual life starts long before puberty arrives, and gradually shapes and develops as the organism matures... Chastity is an unknown virtue among these natives. At an incredibly early age they become initiated into sexual life... As they grow up, they live in promiscuous free-love, which gradually develops into more permanent attachments... Marriage is associated with hardly any public or private rite or ceremony. The woman simply joins her husband in his house... In her married life, the woman is supposed to remain faithful to her husband, but this rule is neither very strictly kept nor enforced. In all other ways, she retains a great measure of independence."&lt;ref name="ArgonautsWPac-arcorg" /&gt;

Austrian writer [[Bertha Diener]], also known as Helen Diner, wrote ''Mothers and Amazons'' (1930), which was the first work to focus on women's cultural history. Hers is regarded as a classic of feminist matriarchal study.&lt;ref name="Dinner party"&gt;[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/heritage_floor/helen_diner.php Helen Diner ] Who wrote ''Mothers and Amazons'' (1930), entry at the Brooklyn Museum ''Dinner Party'' database of notable women. Retrieved March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Her view is that in the past all human societies were matriarchal; then, at some point, most shifted to patriarchal and degenerated.

The controversy was reinforced further by the publication of ''[[The White Goddess]]'' by Robert Graves (1948) and his later analysis of classical Greek mythology and the vestiges of earlier myths that had been rewritten after a profound change in the religion of Greek civilization that occurred within its very early historical times.

From the 1950s, [[Marija Gimbutas]] developed a theory of an ''[[Old European culture]]'' in [[neolithic Europe]] which had matriarchal traits, replaced by the patriarchal system of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] with the spread of [[Indo-European languages]] beginning in the [[Bronze Age]].

From the 1970s, these ideas were taken up by popular writers of [[second-wave feminism]] and expanded with the speculations of [[Margaret Murray]] on [[witchcraft]], by the [[Goddess movement]], and in [[feminist Wicca]], as well as in works by [[Elizabeth Gould Davis]], [[Riane Eisler]], and [[Merlin Stone]].

The concept of a matriarchal golden age in the Neolithic Age has been denounced as feminist wishful thinking in ''[[The Inevitability of Patriarchy]]'', in ''[[Why Men Rule]]'', more recently by Philip G. Davis in ''Goddess Unmasked'' (1998), and by [[Cynthia Eller]], professor at Montclair State University, in ''[[The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory]]'' (2000).  According to Eller, Gimbutas had a large part in constructing a myth of historical matriarchy by examining Eastern Europe cultures that she asserts, by and large, never really bore any resemblance in character to the alleged universal matriarchy suggested by Gimbutas and Graves. She asserts that in "actually documented primitive societies" of recent (historical) times, paternity is never ignored and that the sacred status of goddesses does not automatically increase female social status, and believes that this affirms that utopian matriarchy is simply an inversion of [[antifeminism]]. The feminist scenarios of Neolithic matriarchy have been called into question and are not emphasized in [[third-wave feminism]].

The original evidence recognized by Gimbutas, however, of Neolithic societies being more [[egalitarian]] than the Bronze Age Indo-European and Semitic patriarchies remains valid. Gimbutas herself has not described these societies as "matriarchal", preferring the term "woman-centered" or "matristic". Del Giorgio, in ''The Oldest Europeans'' (2006), insists on a matrifocal, matrilocal, matrilineal [[Paleolithic]] society.

While the existence of numerous [[matrilineal]] or [[avunculism|avuncular]] societies is undisputed, it has been recognized since the 1970s that there are no societies which are matriarchal in the strong sense that some societies are patriarchal. Joan Bamberger in her 1974 ''The Myth of Matriarchy'' argued that the historical record contains no reliable evidence of any society in which women dominated. Although in [[1977]] [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologist]] Jules de Leeuwe argued that some societies were "mainly ''gynecocratic''"&lt;ref name="Jules de Leeuwe"&gt;Leeuwe, Jules de, untitled comment (Nov. 18, 1977) (emphases so in original), as a response to and with Leacock, Eleanor, ''Women's Status in Egalitarian Society'', ''op. cit.'', p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; (others being "mainly ''androcratic''"),&lt;ref name="Jules de Leeuwe" /&gt; he did not identify any in his short response.&lt;ref name="Jules de Leeuwe" /&gt; Anthropologist Donald Brown's list of "[[human cultural universals]]" (''i.e.'', features shared by all current human societies) includes [[men]] being the "dominant element" in public political affairs (Brown 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;137), which he asserts is the contemporary opinion of mainstream [[anthropology]].

[[Kurt Derungs]] is a non-academic author advocating an "anthropology of landscape" based on allegedly matriarchal traces in [[toponymy]] and [[folklore]].

=== 21st century ===
According to Adovasio, Soffer, and Page, no true matriarchy is known actually to have existed,&lt;ref name="InvisibleSex-pp251-255-255" /&gt; although there is evidence of [[Amazons]] and an Amazonian society having existed and some matrifocal societies do exist.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Spokespersons for various indigenous peoples at the [[United Nations]] and elsewhere have highlighted the central role of women in their societies, referring to them as matriarchies, or as matriarchal in character.&lt;ref&gt;Stella Tamang, Indigenous Affairs 1-2/04 p46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Six Nations Women’s Traditional Council Fire Report to CEDAW p2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==
=== Greece and Rome ===
A legendary matriarchy related by classical Greek writers was the [[Amazons|Amazon]] society. [[Herodotus]] reported that the Sarmatians were descendants of Amazons and Scythians, and that their females observed their ancient maternal customs, "frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands; in war taking the field; and wearing the very same dress as the men". Moreover, said Herodotus, "[n]o girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle". Amazons came to play a role in [[Roman historiography]]. [[Julius Caesar]] spoke of the conquest of large parts of Asia by [[Semiramis]] and the Amazons. Although [[Strabo]] was sceptical about their historicity, the Amazons were taken as historical throughout [[late Antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]] 5.504&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[Church Fathers]] spoke of the Amazons as a real people. Medieval authors continued a tradition of locating the Amazons in the North, [[Adam of Bremen]] placing them at the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Paulus Diaconus]] in the heart of Germania.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. A. Ukert]], ''Die Amazonen'', Abhandlungen der philosophisch-philologischen Classe der Königlich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (1849), 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Ronald Hutton]] has argued that there is no necessary correlation between the worship of [[goddess|female deities]] and relative levels of social or legal egalitarianism, noting the late classical [[Hellenistic religion|Greek]] and [[Ancient Roman religion|Roman]] religions, in which goddesses played important roles. The changes from the earlier mythology are not considered in her analysis, however, and the late classical myths were dominated by male deities. Hutton has also pointed out that, in more recent European history, in [[Habsburg Spain|17th century Spain]], there were many religious institutions staffed exclusively by women.

In [[Greek mythology]], [[Zeus]] is said to have swallowed his pregnant wife, the goddess [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], who was carrying their daughter, [[Athena]]. The mother and child created havoc inside Zeus. Either [[Hermes]] or [[Hephaestus]] split Zeus's head, allowing Athena, in full battle armor, to burst forth from his forehead. Athena was thus described as being "born" from Zeus. Zeus was pleased with the outcome a prophecy that his son would surpass him had not been fulfilled. [[Robert Graves]] suggested that this myth displaced earlier myths that had to change when a major cultural change brought patriarchy to replace a matriarchy.

Apparently as criticism, about 2,400 years ago, in [[:Category:390 BC|390 BCE]], [[Aristophanes]] wrote a play, ''[[Assemblywomen|Ecclesiazusae]]'', about women gaining legislative power and governing [[Athens]], [[Greece]], on a limited principle of equality. In the play, Praxagora, a character, argues that women should rule because they are superior to men, not equal, and yet she declines to assert publicly her right to rule, although elected and although acting in office.&lt;ref name="Manliness-p73-74-n"&gt;Mansfield, Harvey C., ''Manliness'', ''op. cit.'', pp. 73–74 &amp; n. 37, citing Strauss, Leo, ''Socrates and Aristophanes'' (N.Y.: Basic Books, 1966), ch. 9, and Saxonhouse, Arlene W., ''Fear of Diversity'' (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1992), ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The play also suggests that women would rule by not allowing politics, in order to prevent disappointment, and that affirmative action would be applied to heterosexual relationships.&lt;ref name="Manliness-p73-74-n" /&gt; In the play, written when Athens was a male-only democracy where women could not vote or rule, women were presented as unassertive and unrealistic, and thus not qualified to govern.&lt;ref name="Manliness-p73-74-n" /&gt; The play was a fable on the theme that women should stay home.&lt;ref&gt;Ruden, Sarah, ''Paul Among the People: The Apostle Reinterpreted and Reimagined in his Own Time'' (N.Y.: Pantheon Books, 1st ed. 2010 (ISBN 978-0-375-42501-1)), p. 79 (author research fellow, Yale Divinity School).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Celtic myth and society ===
"[T]here ''is'' plenty of evidence of ancient societies where women held greater power than in many societies today. For example, Jean Markale's studies of Celtic societies show that the power of women was reflected not only in myth and legend but in legal codes pertaining to marriage, divorce, property ownership, and the right to rule."&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Margot, ''Drawing Down the Moon'' (2006), ''op. cit.'', p. 196 (italics so in original; p. 196 n. 20 citing Markale, Jean, ''Women of the Celts'' (London: Gordon Cremonesi, 1975)).&lt;/ref&gt;


=== South America ===
Bamberger (1974) examines several matriarchal myths from South American cultures and concludes that portraying the women from this matriarchal period as evil often serves to restrain contemporary women.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}

While ''matriarchy'' has mostly fallen out of use for the anthropological description of existing societies, it remains current as a concept in [[feminism]].&lt;ref name="AppsFLegalTheoryWLSVWR-p9"&gt;Weisberg, D. Kelly, ed., ''Applications of Feminist Legal Theory to Women's Lives: Sex, Violence, Work, and Reproduction'' (Philadelphia: Temple Univ.

In feminist literature, matriarchy and patriarchy are not conceived as simple mirrors of each other.&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p287"&gt;Eller, Cynthia, ''Relativizing the Patriarchy: The Sacred History of the Feminist Spirituality Movement'', in ''History of Religions'', vol. 30, no. 3 (Feb., 1991), p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;
While ''matriarchy'' sometimes means "the political rule of women",&lt;ref&gt;Eller, Cynthia, ''The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory'' (2000), ''op. cit.'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; that meaning is often rejected, on the ground that matriarchy is not a mirroring of patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Eller, Cynthia, ''The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory'' (2000), ''op. cit.'', p. 12 (quoting also Mary Daly ("matriarchy 'was not patriarchy spelled with an "m."'", probably (per ''id.'', p. 12 n. 3) in Daly, Mary, ''Beyond God the Father'', p. 94)).&lt;/ref&gt; Patriarchy is held to be about power over others while matriarchy is held to be about power from within,&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p287" /&gt; [[Starhawk]] having written on that distinction&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p287" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Starhawk, ''[[Dreaming the Dark: Magic, Sex, and Politics]]'' (Boston, Mass.: Beacon Press, 15th Anniversary ed. 1997 (original 1982) (ISBN 0-8070-1037-5)), ch. 1 (original 1982 ed. cited in Eller, Cynthia, ''Relativizing the Patriarchy'', ''op. cit.'', p. 287 n. 17).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Margot Adler]] having argued that matriarchal power is not possessive and not controlling, but is harmonious with nature.&lt;ref&gt;Margot Adler wrote a matriarchy is "a realm where female things are valued and where power is exerted in non-possessive, non-controlling, and organic ways that are harmonious with nature."

A minority of feminists, generally [[radical feminism|radical]] or [[radical lesbians|lesbian]],&lt;ref name="AppsFLegalTheoryWLSVWR-p9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FStateWelfare-p52" /&gt; have argued that women should govern societies of women and men.

== In religious thought ==
Some theology and theocracy limit or forbid women from being in civil government or public leadership or forbid them from voting.&lt;ref&gt;"'Holy Scripture inculcates for women a sphere higher than and apart from that of public life; because as women they find a full measure of duties, cares and responsibilities and are unwilling to bear additional burdens unsuited to their physical organization.'", a "signed ... petition against female suffrage" (Jan., 1871), in Gabriel, Mary, ''Notorious Victoria: The Life of Victoria Woodhull, Uncensored'', ''op. cit.'', p. 83 &amp; n. [9], citing ''The Press—Philadelphia'', Jan. 14, 1871, p. 8 (author Mary Gabriel journalist, Reuters News Service).&lt;/ref&gt; Within none of the following religions is the respective view necessarily universally held:
* In [[Islam]], some Muslim scholars hold that female political leadership is prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', p. [185].&lt;/ref&gt; The prohibition has been attributed to a [[hadith]] of [[Muhammad]],&lt;ref&gt;Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', pp. 186–187. "Koranic verse 4: 34 ... has been used to denounce female leadership" (relevant herein insofar as the female leadership is matriarchal), according to ''id.'', pp. 189–190 ("4: 34" spaced so in original), but the verse may apply to family life rather than to politics, per ''id.'', p. 190; the book, ''id.'', at pp. 189–190 &amp; p. 189 n. 5, cites, respectively, Badawi, Jamal, ''Gender Equity in Islam: Basic Principles'' (Indianapolis: American Trust Publications, 1995), p. 38 &amp; perhaps ''passim'', and Roald, Anne Sofie, &amp; Pernilla Ouis, ''Lyssna på männen: att leva i en patriarkalisk muslimsk kontext'', in ''Kvinnovetenskaplig Tidskrift'', pp. 91–108 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; the founder and last prophet of [[Islam]]. The hadith says, "A people which has a woman as leader will never prosper."&lt;ref&gt;Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', pp. 186–187 (hadith as translated). Another translation is, "A people which has a woman as a leader will not succeed." ''Id.'', p. 188. The 2001 author's paraphrase of the hadith, "the people who have a female leader will not succeed", is at ''id.'', p. [185].&lt;/ref&gt; The hadith's transmission, context, and meaning have been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', pp. 186–189.&lt;/ref&gt; The prohibition has also been attributed as an extension of a ban on women leading prayers "in mixed gatherings" (which has been challenged)&lt;ref&gt;Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; and to a restriction on women traveling (an attribution also challenged).&lt;ref&gt;Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly, the hadith applies only against being head of state and not other high office.&lt;ref&gt;Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; One source would allow a woman to "occupy every position except that of ''khalīfa'' (the leader of all Muslims)."&lt;ref&gt;Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', pp. 196–197.&lt;/ref&gt; One exception to the head-of-state prohibition was accepted without a general acceptance of women in political leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', pp. [185]–186.&lt;/ref&gt; Political activism at lower levels may be more acceptable to Islamist women than top leadership positions.&lt;ref&gt;Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', ch. 8, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Muslim Brotherhood]] has stated that women may not be president or head of state but may hold other public offices but, "[a]s for judiciary office, .... [t]he majority of jurispudents ... have forbidden it completely."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=5810&amp;ref=search.php Ikhwan web, ''Muslim Brotherhood on Muslim women in Islamic Society'' (Oct. 29, 2005) (trans.)], as accessed Mar. 5, 2011, [§] ''The Woman's Right to Vote, Be Elected and Occupy Public and Governmental Posts.'', [sub§] ''Thirdly, Women's Holding of Public Office''.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of 82 Islamists in Europe, 80% said women could not be state leaders but 75% said women could hold other high positions.&lt;ref&gt;Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', p. 198 (for study details, see ''id.'', ch. 3, ''e.g.'', quantity of 82 per p. 64).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the Muslim Brotherhood said that "'social circumstances and traditions'" may justify gradualism in the exercise of women's right to hold office (below head of state).&lt;ref&gt;Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', p. 197, quoting The Muslim Brotherhood, ''The Role of Women in Islamic Society According to the Muslim Brotherhood'' (London: International Islamic Forum, 1994), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the Muslim Brothers still support that statement is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;The document stating it was not available at its [http://www.ikhwanweb.com/search.php? official English-language website advanced search page], as accessed Mar. 5, 2011 (search for "Role of Women in Islamic Society" without quotation marks yielding no results), but a document with similar relevant effect is [http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=5810&amp;ref=search.php Ikhwan web , ''Muslim Brotherhood on Muslim women in Islamic Society'' (Oct. 29, 2005) (trans.)], as accessed Mar. 5, 2011 ("social circumstances and traditions" as justifying gradualism, per [§] ''A General Remark'').&lt;/ref&gt; As reported in 1953, "Islamic organizations held a conference in the office of the Muslim Brothers .... [and] claim[ed] ... that it had been proven that political rights for women were contrary to religion".&lt;ref&gt;Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', p. 34, citing, at p. 34 n. 44, Shafiq, Duriyya, ''al-Kitab al-abiyad lil-huquq al-mar'a al-misriyya'' (''The White Paper on the Rights of the Egyptian Woman'') (Cairo: n.p., 1953) (bibliographic information partly per Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', p. 25 n. 27).&lt;/ref&gt; Some nations have specific bans. In [[Iran#Government and politics|Iran]] at times, women have been forbidden to fill some political offices because of law or because of judgments made under the Islamic religion.&lt;ref&gt;Rostami Povey, Elaheh, ''Feminist Contestations of Institutional Domains in Iran'', in ''Feminist Review'', no. 69, pp. 49 &amp; 53 (Winter, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; As to [[Saudi Arabia#Government and Politics|Saudi Arabia]], "Saudi women ... are ... not allowed to enter parliament as anything more than advisors; they cannot vote, much less serve as representatives".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabinsight.org/aiarticles/181.pdf Al-Mohamed, Asmaa, ''Saudi Women's Rights: Stuck at a Red Light'' (Arab Insight (World Security Institute), Jan. 8, 2008)], p. 46, as accessed Dec. 28, 2010 (author online editor, Al Arabiya, Saudi Arabia, journalist, &amp; women's rights activist).&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Judaism]], among [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox]] leaders, a position, beginning before [[Israel]] became a modern state, has been that for women to hold public office in Israel would threaten the state's existence, according to educator [[Tova Hartman]],&lt;ref&gt;Hartman, Tova, ''Feminism Encounters Traditional Judaism: Resistance and Accommodation'' (Waltham, Mass.: Brandeis Univ. Press &amp; Hanover: Univ. Press of New England, 1st ed. 2007 (ISBN 978-1-58465-659-3)), p. 105 (author lecturer, [[Bar-Ilan University|Bar Ilan Univ.]]), attributing the argument to [[Abraham Isaac Kook|Rav Kook]], or Rabbi Abraham Isaac Hacohen Kook, "a significant spiritual leader of the ["early twentieth century"]", ''id.'', p. 101, citing, at ''id.'', pp. 101–102, Kook, Rav, ''Open Letter to the Honorable Committee of the "Mizrahi" Association'' (1919) ("In the Torah, in the Prophets and in the Writings, in the Halacha and in the Aggadah, we hear ... that the duty of fixed public service falls upon men.").&lt;/ref&gt; who reports the view has "wide consensus".&lt;ref&gt;Hartman, Tova, ''Feminism Encounters Traditional Judaism'', ''op. cit.'', p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; When Israel ratified the international women's equality agreement known as [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|CEDAW]], it reserved nonenforcement for any religious communities that forbid women from sitting on religious courts.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Marsha, ''Women, Law, Religion, and Politics in Israel: A Human Rights Perspective'', in Misra, Kalpana, &amp; Melanie S.

* [[Hindu]] nationalist political leaders only include women as "exception[s]"&lt;ref&gt;Bacchetta, Paola, ''Hindu Nationalist Women: On the Use of the Feminine Symbolic to (Temporarily) Displace Male Authority'', in [[Laurie L. Patton|Patton, Laurie L.]], ed., ''Jewels of Authority: Women and Textual Tradition in Hindu India'' (N.Y.: Oxford Univ.

=== Thealogy ===
{{main|Thealogy|Goddess movement}}
Feminist [[thealogy]] conceptualized humanity as beginning with "female-ruled or equalitarian societies",&lt;ref&gt;Eller, Cynthia, ''Relativizing the Patriarchy'', ''op. cit.'', p. 281 and see pp. 282 &amp; 287.&lt;/ref&gt; until displaced by patriarchies,&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p281" /&gt; and that in the millennial future "'gynocentric,' life-loving values"&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p281"&gt;Eller, Cynthia, ''Relativizing the Patriarchy'', ''op. cit.'', p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; will return to prominence.&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p281" /&gt; This produces "a virtually infinite number of years of female equality or superiority coming both at the beginning and end of historical time."&lt;ref&gt;Eller, Cynthia, ''Relativizing the Patriarchy'', ''op. cit.'', p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among criticisms is that a future matriarchy, as a reflection of spirituality, is conceived as timeless and ahistorical,&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p291"&gt;Eller, Cynthia, ''Relativizing the Patriarchy'', ''op. cit.'', p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; and thus may be unrealistic or even meaningless as a goal to secular feminists. Many of what are labeled as matriarchies may be more accurately labeled as [[Matrifocal#Comparison with matrifocality|matrifocal]], [[Matriarchy#Woman-centered as matristic|matristic]], or [[Gynocentrism|gynocentric]] instead, thus lowering the number of true or narrowly-defined matriarches that existed in the past&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p283-paren1"&gt;Eller, Cynthia, ''Relativizing the Patriarchy'', ''op. cit.'', p. 283, esp. 1st parenthetical comment.&lt;/ref&gt; as models for the future. Parts of a thealogical history of matriarchy may be unsupported by secular modern historical scholarship.
