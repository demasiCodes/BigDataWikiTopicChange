{{Forms of government}}

A '''matriarchy''' is a [[social organization]]al form in which the [[mother]] or oldest female heads the family. Descent and relationship are determined through the female line. It is also government or rule by a woman or women. While those definitions apply in general English, definitions specific to the disciplines of [[anthropology]] and [[feminism]] differ in some respects.

Most anthropologists hold that there are no known societies that are unambiguously matriarchal, but some authors believe exceptions may exist or may have. Matriarchies may also be confused with [[matrilineality|matrilineal]], [[matrilocal residence|matrilocal]], and [[matrifocal family|matrifocal]] societies. A few people consider any non-[[patriarchy|patriarchal]] system to be matriarchal, thus including genderally equalitarian systems, but most academics exclude them from matriarchies strictly defined.

In 19th century Western scholarship, the hypothesis of matriarchy representing an early, mainly prehistoric, stage of human development gained popularity. Possibilities of so-called primitive societies were cited and the hypothesis survived into the 20th century, including in the context of [[second-wave feminism]]. This hypothesis was criticized by some authors, including [[Camille Paglia]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} and [[Cynthia Eller]], and remains as a largely unsolved question to this day. Some older myths describe matriarchies. Several modern feminists have advocated for matriarchy now or in the future and it has appeared in [[feminist fiction]]. In several theologies, matriarchy has been portrayed as negative.

== Definitions, connotations, and etymology ==
According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED''), ''matriarchy'' is a "form of social organization in which the mother or oldest female is the head of the family, and descent and relationship are reckoned through the female line; government or rule by a woman or women."&lt;ref name="OED-matriarchy"&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' (online), entry ''matriarchy'', as accessed November 3, 2013{{Subscription or libraries}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A popular definition, according to James Peoples and Garrick Bailey, is "female dominance".&lt;ref name="HumanityIntroCulturAnthro-9ed-p259col1"&gt;Peoples, James, &amp; Garrick Bailey, ''Humanity: An Introduction to Cultural Anthropology'' (Australia: Wadsworth (Cengage Learning), 9th ed. 2012 (ISBN 978-1-111-30152-1)), p.&amp;nbsp;259, col.&amp;nbsp;1 (author Peoples prof. sociology/anthropology &amp; dir. E. Asian studies, Ohio Wesleyan University, &amp; previously taught at Univ. of California at Davis &amp; Univ.of Tulsa &amp; author Bailey taught anthro. at Univ. of Tulsa, sr. Fellow in anthro. at Smithsonian Institution, &amp; scholar at School of American Research, Santa Fe).&lt;/ref&gt; Within the academic discipline of [[cultural anthropology]], according to the ''OED'', ''matriarchy'' is a "culture or community in which such a system prevails"&lt;ref name="OED-matriarchy" /&gt; or a "family, society, organization, etc., dominated by a woman or women."&lt;ref name="OED-matriarchy" /&gt; In general anthropology, according to William A. Haviland, ''matriarchy'' is "rule by women".&lt;ref name="Anthro-Haviland-8ed-p579col1"&gt;Haviland, William A., ''Anthropology'' (Ft. Worth: Harcourt Brace College Publishers, 8th ed. 1997 (ISBN 0-15-503578-9)), p.&amp;nbsp;579, col.&amp;nbsp;1 (author prof. anthropology, Univ. of Vermont).&lt;/ref&gt; A ''matriarchy'' is a [[society]] in which females, especially mothers, have the central roles of political leadership, [[moral authority]], and control of property, but does not include a society that occasionally is led by a female for nonmatriarchal reasons or an occupation in which females generally predominate without reference to matriarchy, such as [[prostitution]] or [[auxiliary (fraternal orders)|women's auxiliaries]] of organizations run by men.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} According to Lawrence A. Kuzner in 1997, [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown|A. R. Radcliffe-Brown]] argued in 1924 that the definitions of ''matriarchy'' and ''patriarchy'' had "logical and empirical failings&amp;nbsp;.... [and] were too vague to be scientifically useful".&lt;ref&gt;Kuznar, Lawrence A., ''Reclaiming a Scientific Anthropology'' (Walnut Creek, Calif.: AltaMira Press (div. of Sage Publications), pbk. 1997 (ISBN 0-7619-9114-X)).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most academics exclude egalitarian nonpatriarchal systems from matriarchies more strictly defined. According to [[Heide Göttner-Abendroth]], a reluctance to accept the existence of matriarchies might be based on a specific culturally biased notion of how to define ''matriarchy'': because in a [[patriarchy]] men rule over women, a matriarchy has frequently been conceptualized as women ruling over men,&lt;ref name="MatriarchalSocDefTheory"&gt;[http://www.gift-economy.com/athanor/athanor_005.html Goettner-Abendroth, Heide, ''Matriarchal Society: Definition and Theory''], as accessed January 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; while she believed that matriarchies are [[egalitarian]].&lt;ref name="MatriarchalSocDefTheory" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lepowsky, M. A., ''Fruit of the Motherland: Gender in an Egalitarian Society'' (U.S.: Columbia University Press, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''matriarchy'', for a society politically led by females, especially mothers, who also control property, is often interpreted to mean the genderal opposite of ''patriarchy'', but it is not an opposite (linguistically, it is not a parallel term).&lt;ref&gt;Compare, in ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (online), entry ''patriarchy'' to entry ''matriarchy'', both as accessed November 3, 2013.{{Subscription or libraries|sentence}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eller, Cynthia, ''Living in the Lap of the Goddess: The Feminist Spirituality Movement in America'' (Boston, Massachusetts: Beacon Press, 1995 (ISBN 0-8070-6507-2)), pp.&amp;nbsp;161–162 &amp; 184 &amp; n.&amp;nbsp;84 (author, with doctorate in religion from Univ. of Southern Calif., taught at Yale Divinity School &amp; Fairleigh Dickinson Univ.)

["''matriarchy''"] means government by mothers, or more broadly, government and power in the hands of women."&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Margot, ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America]]'' (N.Y.: Penguin Books, 2006 (ISBN 0-14-303819-2)), p.&amp;nbsp;193 (previous editions in 1979, 1986, &amp; 1997) (italics so in original) (author then N.Y. Bureau Chief for [[NPR|National Public Radio]]).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Love]] and Elizabeth Shanklin wrote, "by 'matriarchy,' we mean a non-alienated society: a society in which women, those who produce the next generation, define motherhood, determine the conditions of motherhood, and determine the environment in which the next generation is reared."&lt;ref&gt;Love, Barbara, &amp; Elizabeth Shanklin, ''The Answer is Matriarchy'', in Trebilcot, Joyce, ed., ''Mothering: Essays in Feminist Theory'' (New Jersey: Rowman &amp; Allenheld, 1983), pp.&amp;nbsp;275.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Cynthia Eller]], "'matriarchy' can be thought of&amp;nbsp;... as a shorthand description for any society in which women's power is equal or superior to men's and in which the culture centers around values and life events described as 'feminine.'"&lt;ref&gt;Eller, Cynthia, ''The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory: Why an Invented Past Won't Give Women a Future'' (Boston, Mass.: Beacon Press, 2000 (ISBN 0-8070-6792-X)), pp.&amp;nbsp;12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Eller wrote that the idea of ''matriarchy'' mainly rests on two pillars, romanticism and modern social criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Eller, Cynthia, ''Gentlemen and Amazons: The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory, 1861–1900'' (Berkeley: Univ. of Calif. Press, 2011).{{Page needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of matriarchy was meant to describe something like a utopia placed in the past in order to legitimate contemporary social criticism.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} With respect to a [[#Paleolithic and Neolithic Ages|prehistoric matriarchal Golden Age]], according to Barbara Epstein, "matriarchy&amp;nbsp;... means a social system organized around matriliny and goddess worship in which women have positions of power."&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Barbara, ''Political Protest and Cultural Revolution: Nonviolent Direct Action in the 1970s and 1980s'' (Berkeley, Calif.: Univ. of Calif.

According to Adler, "a number of feminists note that few definitions of the word ["''matriarchy''"], despite its literal meaning, include any concept of power, and they suggest that centuries of oppression have made it impossible for women to conceive of themselves with such power."&lt;ref name="DrawDnMoon-2006-p194" /&gt;

Matriarchy has often been presented as negative, in contrast to patriarchy as natural and inevitable for society, thus that matriarchy is hopeless. Love and Shanklin wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When we hear the word "matriarchy", we are conditioned to a number of responses: that matriarchy refers to the past and that matriarchies have never existed; that matriarchy is a hopeless fantasy of female domination, of mothers dominating children, of women being cruel to men. Conditioning us negatively to matriarchy is, of course, in the interests of patriarchs. We are made to feel that patriarchy is natural; we are less likely to question it, and less likely to direct our energies to ending it.&lt;ref&gt;Love, Barbara, &amp; Elizabeth Shanklin, ''The Answer is Matriarchy'', ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Matriarchal Studies school led by Göttner-Abendroth calls for an even more inclusive redefinition of the term: Göttner-Abendroth defines ''Modern Matriarchal Studies'' as the "investigation and presentation of non-patriarchal societies", effectively defining ''matriarchy'' as ''non-patriarchy''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.second-congress-matriarchal-studies.com/goettnerabendroth.html ''Introduction'', in ''Second World Congress on Matriarchal Studies''].&lt;/ref&gt; She has also defined ''matriarchy'' as characterized by the sharing of power equally between the two genders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://matriarchy.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=143&amp;Itemid=83 DeMott, Tom, ''The Investigator'' (review of Bennholdt-Thomsen, Veronika, Cornelia Giebeler, Brigitte Holzer, &amp; Marina Meneses, ''Juchitán, City of Women'' (Mexico: Consejo Editorial, 1994))], as accessed Feb. 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Diane LeBow, "matriarchal societies are often described as&amp;nbsp;... egalitarian&amp;nbsp;...",&lt;ref&gt;LeBow, Diane, ''Rethinking Matriliny Among the Hopi'', in Rohrlich, Ruby, &amp; Elaine Hoffman Baruch, eds., ''Women in Search of Utopia: Mavericks and Mythmakers'' (N.Y.: Schocken Books, 1984 (ISBN 0-8052-0762-7)), p.&amp;nbsp;13 (author taught women's studies &amp; Eng., teaches in Humanities Div., Cañada Coll., Calif., &amp; directs Women's Ctr., Women's Studies, &amp; Women's Re-entry Pgm., Cañada Coll., Calif.)&lt;/ref&gt; although anthropologist Ruby Rohrlich has written of "the centrality of women in an egalitarian society."&lt;ref&gt;Rohrlich, Ruby, ''Women in Transition: Crete and Sumer'', in Rohrlich, Ruby, &amp; Elaine Hoffman Baruch, eds., ''Women in Search of Utopia'', ''op. cit.'', p. 37 (author prof. emeritus anthropology, Manhattan Community Coll., City Univ. of N.Y., &amp; research assoc., Univ. of Calif., Berkeley).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Feminist anthropology]], an approach to anthropology that tries to reduces male bias in the field}}

Matriarchy is also the public formation in which the woman occupies the ruling position in a family.&lt;ref name="OED-matriarchy" /&gt; For this usage, some scholars now prefer the term ''matrifocal'' to ''matriarchal''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} Some, including [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan|Daniel Moynihan]], claimed that there is a matriarchy among Black families in the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/dol/aboutdol/history/webid-meynihan.htm Office of Policy Planning and Review (Daniel Patrick Moynihan, principal author), ''The Negro Family: The Case For National Action'' (U.S. Department of Labor, 1965)], esp.

Some question whether a queen ruling without a king is sufficient to constitute female government, given the amount of participation of other men in most such governments.

=== Intergenerational relationships ===
Some people who sought evidence for the existence of a matriarchy often mixed ''matriarchy'' with anthropological terms and concepts describing specific arrangements in the field of family relationships and the organization of family life, such as ''matrilineality'' and ''matrilocality''. These terms refer to intergenerational relationships (as ''matriarchy'' may), but do not distinguish between males and females insofar as they apply to specific arrangements for sons as well as daughters from the perspective of their relatives on their mother's side. Accordingly, these concepts do not represent ''matriarchy'' as 'power of women over men'.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro, Gary, Wenda Trevathan, &amp; Janet Levy, ''Anthropology: An Applied Perspective'' (Minneapolis: West Publishing Co., 1992), p.&amp;nbsp;360.{{Verify source|type=title or year|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, it is not easy to categorize Mosuo culture within traditional Western definitions. They have aspects of a matriarchal culture: women are often the head of the house, inheritance is through the female line, and women make business decisions. However, unlike in a true matriarchy, political power tends to be in the hands of males.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mosuoproject.org/matri.htm Lugu Lake Mosuo Cultural Development Association, ''The Mosuo: Matriarchal/Matrilineal Culture'' (2006)], retrieved July 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manipur, in north-east India, is not at all a matriarchy. Though mothers there are in forefront of most of the social activism, the society has always been a patriarchal. Their women power is visible because of historical reason. Manipur was ruled by strong dynasties. The need for expansions of borders, crushing any outsider threats etc. engaged the men. And so women had to take charge of home-front.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In our society, women are the center of all things. Nature, we believe, has given women the ability to create; therefore it is only natural that women be in positions of power to protect this function....We traced our clans through women; a child born into the world assumed the clan membership of its mother. Our young women were expected to be physically strong....The young women received formal instruction in traditional planting....Since the Iroquois were absolutely dependent upon the crops they grew, whoever controlled this vital activity wielded great power within our communities. It was our belief that since women were the givers of life they naturally regulated the feeding of our people....In all countries, real wealth stems from the control of land and its resources. Our Iroquois philosophers knew this as well as we knew natural law. To us it made sense for women to control the land since they were far more sensitive to the rhythms of the Mother Earth. We did not own the land but were custodians of it. Our women decided any and all issues involving territory, including where a community was to be built and how land was to be used....In our political system, we mandated full equality. Our leaders were selected by a caucus of women before the appointments were subject to popular review....Our traditional governments are composed of an equal number of men and women. The men are chiefs and the women clan-mothers....As leaders, the women closely monitor the actions of the men and retain the right to veto any law they deem inappropriate....Our women not only hold the reigns of political and economic power, they also have the right to determine all issues involving the taking of human life. Declarations of war had to be approved by the women, while treaties of peace were subject to their deliberations.&lt;ref name="IroquoisCultureCommentary-p53-p55" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== By chronology ===

==== Earliest prehistory and undated ====
The controversy surrounding prehistoric or "primal" matriarchy began in reaction to the book by Bachofen, ''Mother Right: An Investigation of the Religious and Juridical Character of Matriarchy in the Ancient World'', in 1861. Several generations of ethnologists were inspired by his pseudo-evolutionary theory of archaic matriarchy. Following him and [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], several generations of scholars, usually arguing from known myths or oral traditions and examination of Neolithic female cult-figures, suggested that many ancient societies might have been matriarchal, or even that there existed a wide-ranging matriarchal society prior to the ancient cultures of which we are aware. According to Uwe Wesel, Bachofen's myth interpretations have proved to be untenable.&lt;ref&gt;Wesel, Uwe, ''Der Mythos vom Matriarchat. Über Bachofens Mutterrecht und die Stellung von Frauen in frühen Gesellschaften'' (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1980).{{Page needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was further investigated by Lewis Morgan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/morgan-lewis/ancient-society/ancient-society.zip Morgan, L., ''Ancient Society Or Researches in the Lines of Human Progress from Savagery through Barbarism to Civilization''].&lt;/ref&gt; Many researchers studied the phenomenon of matriarchy afterward, but the basis was laid by the classics of sociology. The notion of a "woman-centered" society was developed by Bachofen, whose three-volume ''Myth, Religion, and Mother Right'' (1861) impacted the way classicists such as Harrison, [[Arthur Evans]], [[Walter Burkert]], and [[James Mellaart]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/books?id=reU63yfgrWIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;source=gbs_slider_thumb#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true Ruether, Rosemary Radford, ''Goddesses and the Divine Feminine: A Western Religious History''], p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt; looked at the evidence of [[matriarchal religion]] in pre-Hellenic societies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.br/books?id=3qhQuWPNUckC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=bachofen&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;ei=NEFQTMugHsT68AbzvImIAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true Bachofen, Johann Jakob, ''Myth, Religion, and Mother Right''].{{Page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Susan Mann]], as of 2000, "few scholars these days find&amp;nbsp;...

The following excerpts from Lewis Morgan's ''Ancient Society'' will explain the use of the terms: "In a work of vast research, Bachofen has collected and discussed the evidence of female authority, mother-right, and of female rule, gynecocracy."{{Page needed|date=November 2013}} "Common lands and joint tillage would lead to joint-tenant houses and communism in living; so that gyneocracy seems to require for its creation, descent in the female line. Women thus entrenched in large households, supplied from common stores, in which their own gens so largely predominated in numbers, would produce the phenomena of mother right and gyneocracy, which Bachofen has detected and traced with the aid of fragments of history and of tradition."{{Page needed|date=November 2013}}

[[Friedrich Engels]], in 1884, claimed that, in the earliest stages of human social development, there was group marriage and that therefore paternity was disputable, whereas maternity was not, so that a family could be traced only through the female line, and claimed that this was connected with the dominance of women over men or a ''Mutterrecht'', which notion Engels took from Bachofen, who claimed, based on his interpretations of myths, that myths reflected a memory of a time when women dominated over men.&lt;ref&gt;Engels, Friedrich, ''Der Ursprung der Familie, ds Privateigenthums und des Staates.

Austrian writer Bertha Diener, also known as Helen Diner, wrote ''Mothers and Amazons'' (1930), which was the first work to focus on women's cultural history. Hers is regarded as a classic of feminist matriarchal study.&lt;ref name="Dinner party"&gt;[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/heritage_floor/helen_diner.php ''Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art: The Dinner Party: Heritage Floor: Helen Diner'' (Brooklyn, N.Y.: Brooklyn Museum, last updated March 27, 2007)], as accessed March, 2008, &amp; November 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Her view is that in the past all human societies were matriarchal; then, at some point, most shifted to patriarchal and degenerated. The controversy was reinforced further by the publication of ''[[The White Goddess]]'' by Robert Graves (1948) and his later analysis of classical Greek mythology and the vestiges of earlier myths that had been rewritten after a profound change in the religion of Greek civilization that occurred within its very early historical times. From the 1950s, Marija Gimbutas developed a theory of an ''[[Old European culture]]'' in Neolithic Europe which had matriarchal traits, replaced by the patriarchal system of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] with the spread of [[Indo-European languages]] beginning in the [[Bronze Age]]. According to Epstein, anthropologists in the 20th century said that "the goddess worship or matrilocality that evidently existed in many paleolithic societies was not necessarily associated with matriarchy in the sense of women's power over men. Many societies can be found that exhibit those qualities along with female subordination."&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Barbara, ''Political Protest and Cultural Revolution'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;173.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1970s, these ideas were taken up by popular writers of second-wave feminism and expanded with the speculations of [[Margaret Murray]] on [[witchcraft]], by the [[Goddess movement]], and in [[feminist Wicca]], as well as in works by Eisler, [[Elizabeth Gould Davis]], and [[Merlin Stone]].

"A Golden Age of matriarchy" was, according to Epstein, prominently presented by [[Charlene Spretnak]] and "encouraged" by Stone and Eisler,&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Barbara, ''Political Protest and Cultural Revolution'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;172–173 (including both quotations).&lt;/ref&gt; but, at least for the [[Neolithic]] Age, has been denounced as feminist wishful thinking in ''[[The Inevitability of Patriarchy]]'', ''[[Why Men Rule]]'', ''Goddess Unmasked'',&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Philip G., ''Goddess Unmasked'' (N.Y.: Spence Publishing, 1998 (ISBN 0-9653208-9-8)); [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-54600098.html Sheaffer, R., ''Skeptical Inquirer'' (1999) (review)].&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory]]'' and is not emphasized in [[third-wave feminism]]. According to Eller, Gimbutas had a large part in constructing a myth of historical matriarchy by examining [[Eastern Europe]]an cultures that she asserts, by and large, never really bore any resemblance in character to the alleged universal matriarchy suggested by Gimbutas and Graves. She asserts that in "actually documented primitive societies" of recent (historical) times, paternity is never ignored and that the sacred status of goddesses does not automatically increase female social status, and believes that this affirms that utopian matriarchy is simply an inversion of [[antifeminism]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The original evidence recognized by Gimbutas, however, of Neolithic societies being more [[egalitarian]] than the Bronze Age Indo-European and Semitic patriarchies remains valid.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Gimbutas herself has not described these societies as "matriarchal", preferring the term "woman-centered" or "matristic".{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} J.F. del Giorgio insists on a matrifocal, matrilocal, matrilineal Paleolithic society.&lt;ref&gt;del Giorgio, J.F., ''The Oldest Europeans'' (A.J.Place, 2006 (ISBN 978-980-6898-00-4)).&lt;/ref&gt;

Also according to Rohrlich, "in the early Sumerian city-states 'matriarchy seems to have left something more than a trace.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;Rohrlich, Ruby, ''Women in Transition'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;39, quoting, at p.&amp;nbsp;39 &amp; n.&amp;nbsp;8, Thomson, George, ''The Prehistoric Aegean'' (N.Y.: Citadel Press, 1965), p.&amp;nbsp;160.&lt;/ref&gt;

One common misconception among historians of the Bronze Age such as Stone and Eisler is the notion that the [[Semitic people|Semite]]s were matriarchal while the Indo-Europeans practiced a patriarchal system. An example of this view is found in Stone's ''[[When God Was a Woman]]'',{{Page needed|date=July 2013}} wherein she attempts to make out a case that the worship of [[Yahweh]] was an Indo-European invention superimposed on an ancient matriarchal Semitic nation. Evidence from the [[Amorites]] and [[pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic Arabs]], however, indicates that the primitive Semitic family was in fact patriarchal and patrilineal. Meanwhile, the Indo-Europeans were known to have practiced multiple succession systems, and there is much better evidence of matrilineal customs among the Indo-European [[Celts]] and [[Germans]] than among any ancient Semitic peoples.

Women were running [[Sparta]] while the men were often away fighting. [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta]], responded to a question from a woman in [[Attica]] along the lines of, "why Spartan women were the only women in the world who could rule men?" Gorgo replied, "because we are the only women who are mothers of men".

==== Iron Age to Middle Ages ====
Arising in the period ranging from the [[Iron Age]] to the [[Middle Ages]], several early [[northwestern Europe]]an mythologies from the [[Irish mythology|Irish]] (''e.g.'', [[Macha]] and [[Scáthach]]), the [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]] (''e.g.'', [[Rhiannon]]), and the Germanic (''e.g.'', [[Grendel's mother]] and [[Nerthus]]) contain ambiguous episodes of primal female power which have been interpreted as folk evidence of a real potential for matriarchal attitudes in [[Iron Age|pre-Christian]] European Iron Age societies. Often transcribed from a retrospective, patriarchal, Romanised, and [[Catholic]] perspective, they hint at an earlier, culturally disturbing, era when female power could have predominated. The first-century–attested historic British figure of [[Boudicca]] indicates that Brittonnic society permitted explicit female autocracy or a form of gender equality in a form which contrasted strongly with the patriarchal structure of Mediterranean civilisation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

=== Greece ===
[[Robert Graves]] suggested that a myth displaced earlier myths that had to change when a major cultural change brought patriarchy to replace a matriarchy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} According to this myth, in [[Greek mythology]], [[Zeus]] is said to have swallowed his pregnant lover, the titan goddess [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], who was carrying their daughter, [[Athena]]. The mother and child created havoc inside Zeus. Either [[Hermes]] or [[Hephaestus]] split Zeus's head, allowing Athena, in full battle armor, to burst forth from his forehead. Athena was thus described as being "born" from Zeus. The outcome pleased Zeus as it didn't fulfill the prophecy of Themis which (according to Aeschylus) predicted that Zeus will one day bear a son that would overthrow him. {{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Celtic myth and society ===
According to Adler, "there ''is'' plenty of evidence of ancient societies where women held greater power than in many societies today. For example, [[Jean Markale]]'s studies of Celtic societies show that the power of women was reflected not only in myth and legend but in legal codes pertaining to marriage, divorce, property ownership, and the right to rule."&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Margot, ''Drawing Down the Moon'' (2006), ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;196 (italics so in original; p.&amp;nbsp;196 n.&amp;nbsp;20 citing Markale, Jean, ''Women of the Celts'' (London: Gordon Cremonesi, 1975)).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminist utopia]]s are a form of advocacy. According to Tineke Willemsen, "a feminist utopia would&amp;nbsp;... be the description of a place where at least women would like to live."&lt;ref&gt;Willemsen, Tineke M., ''Feminism and Utopias: An Introduction'' ("the easiest way to describe a feminist utopia is to paraphrase a line coined&amp;nbsp;...."), in Lenning, Alkeline van, Marrie Bekker, &amp; Ine Vanwesenbeeck, eds., ''Feminist Utopias: In a Postmodern Era'' (Tilburg Univ.

[one] stem[s] from feminists who emphasize the differences between women and men. They tend to formulate their ideal world in terms of a society where women's positions are better than men's. There are various forms of matriarchy, or even a utopia that resembles the Greek myth of the Amazons.... [V]ery few modern utopias have been developed in which women are absolute autocrats."&lt;ref&gt;Willemsen, Tineke M., ''Feminism and Utopias'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;6.

A minority of feminists, generally [[radical feminism|radical]],&lt;ref name="AppsFLegalTheoryWLSVWR-p9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FStateWelfare-p52" /&gt; have argued that women should govern societies of women and men. In all of these advocacies, the governing women are not limited to mothers:

Some such advocacies are informed by work on past matriarchy:

Some fiction caricatured the current gender hierarchy by describing a matriarchal alternative without advocating for it.

Some theologies and theocracies limit or forbid women from being in civil government or public leadership or forbid them from voting,&lt;ref&gt;"Holy Scripture inculcates for women a sphere higher than and apart from that of public life; because as women they find a full measure of duties, cares and responsibilities and are unwilling to bear additional burdens unsuited to their physical organization.", a "signed&amp;nbsp;... petition against female suffrage" (January, 1871), in Gabriel, Mary, ''Notorious Victoria'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;83 &amp; n.&amp;nbsp;[9], citing ''The Press—Philadelphia'', January 14, 1871, p.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt; effectively criticizing and forbidding matriarchy. Within none of the following religions is the respective view necessarily universally held:
* In [[Islam]], some Muslim scholars hold that female political leadership is prohibited, according to Anne Sofie Roald.&lt;ref&gt;Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;[185].&lt;/ref&gt; The prohibition has been attributed to a [[hadith]] of [[Muhammad]],&lt;ref&gt;Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;186–187. "Koranic verse 4: 34&amp;nbsp;... has been used to denounce female leadership" (relevant herein insofar as the female leadership is matriarchal), according to ''id.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;189–190 ("4: 34" spaced so in original), but the verse may apply to family life rather than to politics, per ''id.'', p.&amp;nbsp;190; the book, ''id.'', at pp.&amp;nbsp;189–190 &amp; p.&amp;nbsp;189 n.&amp;nbsp;5, cites, respectively, Badawi, Jamal, ''Gender Equity in Islam: Basic Principles'' (Indianapolis: American Trust Publications, 1995), p.&amp;nbsp;38 &amp; perhaps ''passim'', and Roald, Anne Sofie, &amp; Pernilla Ouis, ''Lyssna på männen: att leva i en patriarkalisk muslimsk kontext'', in ''Kvinnovetenskaplig Tidskrift'', pp.&amp;nbsp;91–108 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; the founder and last prophet of Islam. The hadith says, according to Roald, "a people which has a woman as leader will never prosper."&lt;ref&gt;Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;186–187 (hadith as translated). Another translation is, "a people which has a woman as a leader will not succeed." ''Id.'', p.&amp;nbsp;188. The 2001 author's paraphrase of the hadith, "the people who have a female leader will not succeed", is at ''id.'', p.&amp;nbsp;[185].&lt;/ref&gt; The hadith's transmission, context, and meaning have been questioned, wrote Roald.&lt;ref&gt;Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;186–189.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Roald, the prohibition has also been attributed as an extension of a ban on women leading prayers "in mixed gatherings" (which has been challenged)&lt;ref&gt;Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;190.&lt;/ref&gt; and to a restriction on women traveling (an attribution also challenged).&lt;ref name="WomenInIslam-p196"&gt;Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;196.&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly, Roald noted, the hadith applies only against being head of state and not other high office.&lt;ref name="WomenInIslam-p196" /&gt; One source, wrote Roald, would allow a woman to "occupy every position except that of ''khalīfa'' (the leader of all Muslims)."&lt;ref&gt;Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;196–197.&lt;/ref&gt; One exception to the head-of-state prohibition was accepted without a general acceptance of women in political leadership, Roald reported.&lt;ref&gt;Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;[185]–186.&lt;/ref&gt; Political activism at lower levels may be more acceptable to Islamist women than top leadership positions, said Roald.&lt;ref&gt;Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;186 &amp; ch.&amp;nbsp;8, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Muslim Brotherhood]] has stated that women may not be president or head of state but may hold other public offices but, "as for judiciary office,&amp;nbsp;.... [t]he majority of jurispudents&amp;nbsp;... have forbidden it completely."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=5810&amp;ref=search.php Ikhwan web, ''Muslim Brotherhood on Muslim women in Islamic Society'' (October 29, 2005) (trans.)], as accessed March 5, 2011, [§] ''The Woman's Right to Vote, Be Elected and Occupy Public and Governmental Posts.'', [sub§] ''Thirdly, Women's Holding of Public Office''.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of 82 Islamists in Europe, according to Roald, 80% said women could not be state leaders but 75% said women could hold other high positions.&lt;ref&gt;Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;198 (for study details, see ''id.'', ch.&amp;nbsp;3, ''e.g.'', quantity of 82 per p.&amp;nbsp;64).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the Muslim Brotherhood said that "social circumstances and traditions" may justify gradualism in the exercise of women's right to hold office (below head of state).&lt;ref&gt;Roald, Anne Sofie, ''Women in Islam'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;197, quoting The Muslim Brotherhood, ''The Role of Women in Islamic Society According to the Muslim Brotherhood'' (London: International Islamic Forum, 1994), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the Muslim Brothers still support that statement is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;The document stating it was not available at its [http://www.ikhwanweb.com/search.php? official English-language website advanced search page], as accessed March 5, 2011 (search for "Role of Women in Islamic Society" without quotation marks yielding no results), but a document with similar relevant effect is [http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=5810&amp;ref=search.php Ikhwan web, ''Muslim Brotherhood on Muslim women in Islamic Society'' (October 29, 2005) (trans.)], as accessed March 5, 2011 ("social circumstances and traditions" as justifying gradualism, per [§] ''A General Remark'').&lt;/ref&gt; As reported in 1953, Roald reported later, "Islamic organizations held a conference in the office of the Muslim Brothers&amp;nbsp;....

In [[Iran#Government and politics|Iran]] at times, according to Elaheh Rostami Povey, women have been forbidden to fill some political offices because of law or because of judgments made under the Islamic religion.&lt;ref&gt;Rostami Povey, Elaheh, ''Feminist Contestations of Institutional Domains in Iran'', in ''Feminist Review'', no. 69, pp.&amp;nbsp;49 &amp; 53 (Winter, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; As to [[Saudi Arabia#Government and Politics|Saudi Arabia]], according to Asmaa Al-Mohamed, "Saudi women&amp;nbsp;... are&amp;nbsp;... not allowed to enter parliament as anything more than advisors; they cannot vote, much less serve as representatives".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabinsight.org/aiarticles/181.pdf Al-Mohamed, Asmaa, ''Saudi Women's Rights: Stuck at a Red Light'' (Arab Insight (World Security Institute), January 8, 2008)], p.&amp;nbsp;46, as accessed December 28, 2010 (author online editor, Al Arabiya, Saudi Arabia, journalist, &amp; women's rights activist).&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Steven Pinker]], in a 2001–2007 [[Gallup (company)|Gallup poll]] of 35 nations having 90% of the world's Muslims, "substantial majorities of both sexes in all the major Muslim countries say that women should be allowed to vote without influence from men&amp;nbsp;... and to serve in the highest levels of government."&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, Steven, ''The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined'' (N.Y.: Viking, hardback 2011 (ISBN 978-0-670-02295-3)), pp.&amp;nbsp;366–367 and see pp.&amp;nbsp;414–415 (author prof. psychology, Harvard Univ.).&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Judaism]], among [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox]] leaders, a position, beginning before [[Israel]] became a modern state, has been that for women to hold public office in Israel would threaten the state's existence, according to educator [[Tova Hartman]],&lt;ref&gt;Hartman, Tova, ''Feminism Encounters Traditional Judaism: Resistance and Accommodation'' (Waltham, Mass.: Brandeis Univ.

In the play, according to Mansfield, Praxagora, a character, argues that women should rule because they are superior to men, not equal, and yet she declines to assert publicly her right to rule, although elected and although acting in office.&lt;ref name="Manliness-p73-74-n"&gt;Mansfield, Harvey C., ''Manliness'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;73–74 &amp; n.&amp;nbsp;37, citing Strauss, Leo, ''Socrates and Aristophanes'' (N.Y.: Basic Books, 1966), ch.&amp;nbsp;9, and Saxonhouse, Arlene W., ''Fear of Diversity'' (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1992), ch.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; The play, Mansfield wrote, also suggests that women would rule by not allowing politics, in order to prevent disappointment, and that affirmative action would be applied to heterosexual relationships.&lt;ref name="Manliness-p73-74-n" /&gt; In the play, as Mansfield described it, written when Athens was a male-only democracy where women could not vote or rule, women were presented as unassertive and unrealistic, and thus not qualified to govern.&lt;ref name="Manliness-p73-74-n" /&gt; The play, according to Sarah Ruden, was a fable on the theme that women should stay home.&lt;ref&gt;Ruden, Sarah, ''Paul Among the People: The Apostle Reinterpreted and Reimagined in his Own Time'' (N.Y.: Pantheon Books, 1st ed. 2010 (ISBN 978-0-375-42501-1)), p.&amp;nbsp;79 (author research fellow, Yale Divinity School).&lt;/ref&gt;
