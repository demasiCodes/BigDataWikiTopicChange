The term is sometimes used to refer to "government by women", although this is more properly termed ''gynarchy''.

Matriarchal societies have been rare in comparison to [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] societies.  Some have suggested that many ancient societies were matriarchal, or even that there existed a wide-ranging matriarchal society prior to the ancient cultures of which we are aware. However, most professional historians discount these claims on the basis of a lack of historical evidence to support them.

Matriarchy is distinct from [[matrilineality]] and [[matrilocality]].
