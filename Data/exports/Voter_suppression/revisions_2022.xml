'''Voter suppression''' is a strategy used to influence the outcome of an [[election]] by discouraging or preventing specific groups of people from [[voting]]. It is distinguished from [[political campaigning]] in that campaigning attempts to change likely voting behavior by changing the opinions of potential voters through persuasion and organization, activating otherwise inactive voters, or registering new supporters. Voter suppression, instead, attempts to reduce the number of voters who might vote against a candidate or proposition.

The tactics of voter suppression range from minor changes that make voting less convenient,  to physically intimidating and even physically attacking prospective voters, which is illegal. Voter suppression can be effective if a significant number of voters are intimidated or disenfranchised.&lt;ref name="Powers"&gt;{{cite news | last = Powers | first = Scott |author2=David Damron | title =Analysis: 201,000 in Florida didn't vote because of long lines | newspaper = [[Orlando Sentinel]] | location = Orlando, FL | date = January 29, 2013 | url =http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2013-01-29/business/os-voter-lines-statewide-20130118_1_long-lines-sentinel-analysis-state-ken-detzner | access-date = 2016-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Shelby v. Holder]]'' that voting laws had resulted in voter suppression and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/voting-rights-act-harry-reid-senate-93344.html|title=Harry Reid: Senate 'will act' on Voting Rights Act|last=Van Dongen|first=Rachel|date=25 June 2013|access-date=5 July 2013|newspaper=Politico|author2=Everett, Burgess}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===Australia===
[[Australian citizens]] are expected to enroll to vote, and it is their responsibility to update their enrollment when they change their address. Even so, an estimated 6% of eligible Australian voters are not enrolled or are enrolled incorrectly. They are disproportionately younger voters, many of whom might neglect to enroll when they attain [[voting age]].

In 2006, the [[Howard government]] legislated to close the electoral roll much earlier once an election was called than before. Previously, voters had been allowed seven days of grace after an election had been called to arrange or update their enrollment, but new voters were now allowed only until 8:00 p.m. on the day that the electoral [[wtit of election|writ]] was issued to lodge their enrollment form, and those who needed to update their addresses were allowed three days. In [[Australia]], the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] effectively has the right to determine the date of the election as long as constitutional rules regarding the maximum term of the parliament are adhered to. That measure was therefore likely to result in many newer voters being precluded from voting in the first election for which they were eligible because the time to arrange their enrollment once an election is called had been greatly reduced.

The measure was widely seen as an attempt at voter suppression aimed at younger voters&lt;ref&gt;Orr, Graeme [http://inside.org.au/court-by-surprise-the-high-court-upholds-voting-rights/ "Court by surprise: the High Court upholds voting rights"], 6 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; since surveys had shown that younger voters are more likely than the general population to vote for the [[Australian Labor Party]] or the [[Australian Greens|Greens]] than Howard's [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Brooker, Ron [http://resources.news.com.au/files/2011/07/22/1226099/942923-aus-file-young-voters.pdf "Youth Federal Election Voting Intentions: A Statistical and Graphical Analysis of Newspoll Quarterly Data 1996–2010"], The Whitlam Institute, June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The government denied that it was trying to suppress some voters and insisted that the purposes of the reform were a smoother administration of the elections and the reduction of the possibility of electoral fraud. However, the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] had requested no such reform, there had been no evidence of significant electoral fraud, and the Australian Electoral Commission had been dealing with hundreds of thousands of late enrollments without significant problems for decades.

In July 2010, the [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] lobby group [[GetUp!]] launched a challenge to the law. The [[High Court of Australia]] expedited the hearing so that a ruling could be made in time for the [[2010 Australian federal election|2010 federal election]]. The majority ruling struck down early closing of the roll and reinstated the old rule allowing voters seven days grace to arrange or update their enrollment.

Australian citizens of the ages 16 or 17 may enroll online&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.gov.au/enrol/ enroll online]&lt;/ref&gt; so that when they turn 18 they are able to vote.

=== Canada ===
Shortly before the [[2011 Canadian federal election]], voter suppression tactics were [[2011 Canadian federal election voter suppression scandal|exercised by issuing robocalls and live calls]], which falsely advised voters that their polling station had been changed. The locations offered by those messages were intentionally false, often led voters several hours from the correct stations, and often identified themselves illegally as coming from [[Elections Canada]].&lt;ref name="canconrobocall"&gt;{{cite news

  | access-date = 2012-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In litigation brought by the [[Council of Canadians]], a federal court found that such fraud had occurred and had probably been perpetrated by someone with access to the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]]'s voter database, including its information about voter preferences.&lt;ref name="MacCharles"&gt;{{cite news | last = MacCharles| first = Tonda| title = Robocalls: Widespread but 'thinly scattered' vote suppression didn't affect election, judge rules| newspaper = [[Toronto Star]] | date = May 23, 2013 | url = https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2013/05/23/robocalls_widespread_but_thinly_scattered_vote_suppression_didnt_affect_election_judge_rules.html | access-date = 2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court stated that the evidence did not prove that the Conservative Party or that its successful candidates had been directly involved,&lt;ref name="MacCharles"/&gt; but it criticized the Conservative Party for making "little effort to assist with the investigation."&lt;ref name="MacCharles"/&gt; The court did not annul the result in any of six [[rlectoral district (Canada)|ridings]] where the fraud had occurred because it concluded that the number of votes affected had been too small to change the outcome.&lt;ref name="MacCharles"/&gt;

=== France ===
In France, being registered on voting lists is automatic by arriving majority age when the people made their census at the town hall (obligatory to obtain a driving licence or the baccalaureat for people with french nationality) but not automatic when changing address, or even having already been registering.

Registration is sometimes done even without any request, but that is not mandatory for authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Listes électorales : nouvelle inscription|trans-title=Election lists: new registration|url=https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F1367|url-status=live|access-date=2021-05-15|website=www.service-public.fr|language=Fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israel ===
In April 2019, during [[Israel]]'s general elections for the 21st [[Knesset]], [[Likud]] activists installed hidden cameras in polling stations in [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab communities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5491778,00.html|title=Outrage as Likud activists secretly film voting in Arab communities|date=2019-09-04|website=Ynetnews|language=en|access-date=2019-04-10|last1=Azoulay|first1=Moran}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Election observers]] were seen wearing such cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=ynet|title=משקיפים של הליכוד עם מצלמות נסתרות על מצביעים בקלפיות|date=2019-04-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr0pbIkoWuI |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211222/Lr0pbIkoWuI |archive-date=2021-12-22 |url-status=live|access-date=2019-04-10}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hanan Melcer]], the Head of the General Elections Committee, called the cameras illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/society/1554799171-fears-of-meddling-mounts-as-numerous-complaints-are-registered|title=i24NEWS|website=www.i24news.tv|access-date=2019-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, the public relations agency Kaizler Inbar took credit for the operation and said it had been planned in collaboration with Likud. It claimed that voter turnout in Arab communities had fallen under 50% by the presence of the agency's observers in the polling stations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Kaizler.Inbar/posts/441952923292920|title=קייזלר ענבר|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is little evidence that the cameras had any effect on the voter turnout since the Arabs had promised to boycott the election well before the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Israel's young Arab citizens call for election boycott|url=https://www.jpost.com/israel-elections/israels-young-arab-citizens-call-for-election-boycott-585859|access-date=2020-07-05|website=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taiwan ===
{{Confusing|section|date=March 2022}}
Political participation is crucial in a democratic country like Taiwan.{{fact|date=March 2022}} The analysis of its voting turnout shows that it has been much higher than other democratic countries. However, voting suppression in Taiwan focuses on two main factors: age and ethnicity. Thus, voting suppression in Taiwan involves older individuals in poor health. There are three voting groups that are in Taiwan: Pan-Blue supporters, Pan-Green, and independents. Voters calling themselves independents are less likely to vote because they receive less political information. Thus, the inadequate advertising of political information for the people contributes to voting suppression since such people are less informed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Wu|first1=Chung-li|title=Political Participation in Taiwan|date=2017|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvndv9z7.14|work=The Taiwan Voter|pages=252–272|editor-last=Achen|editor-first=Christopher H.|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-07353-5|access-date=2020-11-11|last2=Liu|first2=Tzu-Ping|jstor=j.ctvndv9z7.14|editor2-last=Wang|editor2-first=T. Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor is the difference in ethnic backgrounds between Minnan and Mainlanders, which affects their political participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Batto|first=Nathan F.|date=2020-08-20|title=The Taiwan Voter, edited by Christopher H.

{{main|Voter suppression in the United States}}
In the [[United States]], elections are administered locally, and forms of voter suppression vary among jurisdictions. When the country was founded, the right to vote in most states was limited to property-owning white males.&lt;ref name="Carroll2003"&gt;Bret Carroll.

In the late 19th and the early 20th centuries, Southern states passed [[Jim Crow laws]] to suppress poor and racial minority voters that involved [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], [[literacy tests]], and [[grandfather clauses]].&lt;ref name="Johnson2010"&gt;Kimberley Johnson.

Even after the repeal of those statutes, there have been repetited incidents of racial discrimination  against voters, especially in the South. For example, 87,000 people in Georgia were unable to vote in 2018 because of late registration. Many of the strictest voting regulations are in swing states and have been enacted primarily by [[U.S. Republican Party]] politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kauffman|first=Angela Caputo, Geoff Hing, and Johnny|title=A Georgia law prevented 87,000 people from voting last year.

The study's analysis noted, "A disproportionate number of those potential voters were people of color or young voters, groups that typically favor Democrats."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kauffman|first=Angela Caputo, Geoff Hing, and Johnny|title=A Georgia law prevented 87,000 people from voting last year.

In 2013, [[voter ID]] laws arose after the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act. Some argue that such laws amount to voter suppression against African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Childress|first1=Sarah|title=With Voting Rights Act Out, States Push Voter ID Laws|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/with-voting-rights-act-out-states-push-voter-id-laws/|work=FRONTLINE|publisher=PBS|date=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Childress|first1=Sarah|title=Supreme Court Strikes Blow to Voting Rights Act: What's Next?|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/supreme-court-strikes-blow-to-voting-rights-act-whats-next/|work=FRONTLINE|publisher=PBS|date=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Texas, a voter ID law requiring a driver's license, passport, military identification, or gun permit was repeatedly found to be intentionally discriminatory. The state's election laws could be put back under the control of the [[U.S. Department of Justice]]. Under Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]], however, the DOJ expressed support for Texas's ID law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/a-court-strikes-down-texass-voter-id-law-for-the-fifth-time/537792/|title=A Court Strikes Down Texas's Voter ID Law For the Fifth Time|date=August 24, 2017|website=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sessions was accused by [[Coretta Scott King]] in 1986 of trying to suppress the black vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=January 10, 2017 |title=Read the letter Coretta Scott King wrote opposing Sessions's 1986 federal nomination |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/01/10/read-the-letter-coretta-scott-king-wrote-opposing-sessionss-1986-federal-nomination/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar ID law in North Dakota, which would have disenfranchised many [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], was also overturned.&lt;ref name="nprvote"&gt;{{cite web |website=NPR |date=August 2, 2016 |title=As November Approaches, Courts Deal Series Of Blows To Voter ID Laws |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/08/02/488392765/as-november-approaches-courts-deal-series-of-blows-to-voter-id-laws}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Wisconsin, a federal judge found that the state's restrictive voter ID law had led to "real incidents of disenfranchisement, which undermine rather than enhance confidence in elections, particularly in minority communities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hyp.is/Mrc_rAC9EeiVTFMDt_YwQA/elections.wi.gov/sites/default/files/news/petersonruling_pdf_14890.pdf|title=Case: 3:15-cv-00324-jdp Document #: 234 In the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin|access-date=January 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since there was no evidence of widespread voter impersonation in Wisconsin, it found that the law was "a cure worse than the disease." In addition to imposing strict voter ID requirements, the law reduced early voting, required people to live in a ward for at least 28 days before voting, and prohibited emailing absentee ballots to voters.&lt;ref name="nprvote" /&gt;

Other controversial measures include shutting down [[Department of Motor Vehicles]] (DMV) offices in minority neighborhoods, which makes it more difficult for residents to obtain voter IDs;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=CNN |title=DOT launches investigation in Alabama over DMV closures |date=December 9, 2015 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/09/politics/alabama-dmv-closures-voting-rights/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Esquire |title=The State of Alabama Has Fully Lost Its Mind |date=April 12, 2017 |url=http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/news/a54465/alabama-bentley-resign-church-police/}}&lt;/ref&gt; shutting down polling places in minority neighborhoods;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=The Nation |title=There Are 868 Fewer Places to Vote in 2016 Because the Supreme Court Gutted the Voting Rights Act |date=November 4, 2016 |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/there-are-868-fewer-places-to-vote-in-2016-because-the-supreme-court-gutted-the-voting-rights-act/}}&lt;/ref&gt; systematically depriving precincts in minority neighborhoods of the resources needed to operate efficiently, such as poll workers and voting machines;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Long Lines at Minority Polling Places |date=September 24, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/opinion/long-lines-at-minority-polling-places.html?_r=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and purging voters from the rolls shortly before an election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Ruling Preserves Voting Rights for Thousands in North Carolina |date=November 4, 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/05/us/north-carolina-voting-rights.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, voter fraud is cited as a justification for such laws even if the incidence is low. In Iowa, lawmakers passed a strict voter ID law with the potential to disenfranchise 260,000 voters. Out of 1.6 million votes cast in Iowa in 2016, there were only 10 allegations of voter fraud, none of which being cases of impersonation that a voter ID law could have prevented.  Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, the architect of the bill, admitted, "We've not experienced widespread voter fraud in Iowa."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=The Nation |title=Iowa's New Voter-ID Law Would Have Disenfranchised My Grandmother |date=April 13, 2017 |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/iowas-new-voter-id-law-would-have-disenfranchised-my-grandmother/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] established the [[Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity]] for the purpose of preventing voter fraud. Critics have suggested its true purpose is voter suppression. The commission was led by Kansas Secretary of State [[Kris Kobach]], a staunch advocate of strict voter ID laws and a proponent of the Crosscheck system. Crosscheck is a national database, which is designed to check for voters who are registered in more than one state by comparing names and dates of birth. Researchers at Stanford University, the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University, and Microsoft found that for every legitimate instance of double registration it finds, Crosscheck's algorithm returns approximately 200 false positives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=June 30, 2017 |title=How Trump's nationwide voter data request could lead to voter suppression |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/30/how-trumps-nationwide-voter-data-request-could-lead-to-voter-suppression/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kobach has been repeatedly sued by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) for trying to restrict voting rights in Kansas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 13, 2017 |title=The Man Behind Trump's Voter-Fraud Obsession |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/magazine/the-man-behind-trumps-voter-fraud-obsession.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://theintercept.com/2016/10/27/voter-suppression-is-the-real-election-scandal/ |title=Voter Suppression is the Real Election Scandal| work=[[The Intercept]]|date= October 27, 2016| author=Speri, Alice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
