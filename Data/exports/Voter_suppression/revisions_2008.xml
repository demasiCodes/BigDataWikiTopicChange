'''Voter suppression''' is a form of [[electoral fraud]] and refers to the use of governmental power, political campaign strategy, and private resources aimed at suppressing (i.e. reducing) the total vote of opposition candidacies instead of attempting to change likely voting behavior by changing the opinions of potential voters. This method is particularly effective if a significant amount of voters are intimidated individually because the voter might not consider his or her single vote important. 

==Methods of voter suppression==
===Jim Crow laws===
{{main|Jim Crow laws}}
In the [[United States]], voter suppression was used extensively in most [[U.S. Southern states|Southern state]]s until the [[Voting Rights Act]] ([[1965]]) made most disenfranchisement and voting qualifications illegal. Traditional voter suppression tactics included the institution of [[poll tax]]es and [[literacy test]]s, aimed at suppressing the votes of African Americans and working class white voters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umich.edu/~lawrace/disenfranchise1.htm Techniques of Direct Disenfranchisement, 1880-1965], [[University of Michigan]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/history/creating2.htm Creating Jim Crow: In-Depth Essay], Ronald L. F. Davis, Ph. D - [http://www.jimcrowhistory.org The History of Jim Crow]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ex-Felon disenfranchisement===
In 2004, 5.3 million Americans were denied the right to vote because of previous felony convictions. Thirteen states permanently disenfranchise convicted felons; eighteen states restore voting rights after completion of prison, parole, and probation; four states re-enfranchise felons after they have been released from prison and have completed parole; thirteen allow felons who have been released from prison to vote, and two states do not disenfranchise felons at all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sentencingproject.org/pdfs/1046.pdf Felony Disenfranchisement Laws in the United States Fact Sheet], [[Sentencing Project]], July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, for states that do offer a path for restoration of voting rights, the process can often be very difficult.

The United States is the only democracy in the world that bans its felons from voting. Other countries including Denmark, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Norway, Peru, Sweden, and Zimbabwe all allow their prisoners to vote.&lt;ref name="reform"&gt; 
[http://www.reformelections.org/feature.asp?menuid={2C21F24C-F920-4FAE-81E2-715512C100BA} Restoration of Voting Rights Q&amp;A], ReformElections.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries, notably the U.K., do not permit convicted prisoners in jail to vote but restore full civil rights on release even if that release is on parole.

In [[Florida]] during the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], some non-felons were banned due to [[Florida Central Voter File|record-keeping errors]] and not warned of their disqualification before they no longer had the right to contest it.

This form of vote suppression disproportionately affects minorities including African-Americans and Latinos.&lt;ref name="reform"/&gt;

===Partisan election administration===
Across the United States, 33 state election directors are elected partisans. The majority of the world's democracies use independent agents to manage elections. Because of their partisan ties, election officials are often presented with a conflict of interest while directing elections. Florida Secretary of State [[Katherine Harris]] served as state co-chair of the Bush-Cheney campaign during the 2000 presidential election, and Ohio Secretary of State [[Ken Blackwell]] served as his state's Bush-Cheney co-chair during the 2004 presidential election.&lt;ref name="overton"&gt;{{cite book |title=Stealing Democracy |last=Overton |first=Spencer |year=2006 |publisher=W. W. Norton |isbn=0393061590 |pages=224 |url=http://www.stealingdemocracy.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inequality in Election Day resources===
Elections in the United States are funded at the local level, often unequally. In the 2004 elections, Wyoming spent $2.15 per voter while California spent $3.99 per voter. In contrast, Canada spends $9.51 per voter. This can result in long lines at the polls, waits of many hours, with those unable to wait giving up thier right to vote. It is widely regarded as being a greater problem in urban areas.&lt;ref name="overton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 2004, the Franklin County board of elections (Columbus, Ohio) determined they needed 5,000 machines, but decided to move machines from urban areas to suburban areas and go with only 2,866 machines. On Election Day 2004, Tanya Thivener waited four hours in line to vote in Columbus, Ohio. Tanya's mother waited just 15 minutes to vote in a Columbus suburb.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caging lists===
{{main|caging list}}
Caging lists have been used by political parties to eliminate potential voters from the other party's voting roll.  A political party sends registered mail to addresses of registered voters. If the mail is returned as undeliverable the party uses that fact to challenge the registration, arguing that because the voter could not be reached at the address, the registration is fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mtstandard.com/articles/2008/10/05/opinion/hjjbijjejjigfj.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of voter suppression in the United States==
===2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone jamming scandal===
In the [[2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone jamming scandal]], Republican officials attempted to reduce the number of Democratic voters by paying professional telemarketers in Idaho to make repeated hang-up calls to block Democrats' ride-to-the-polls phone lines on election day.&lt;ref name="dojjamming"&gt;{{cite press release
