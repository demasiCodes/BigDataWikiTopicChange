{{Antisemitism}}
'''Antisemitism''' (also spelled '''anti-semitism''' or '''anti-Semitism''') is suspicion of, hatred toward, or [[discrimination]] against Jews for reasons connected to their Jewish heritage.  According to a 2005 U.S. governmental report, antisemitism is "hatred toward Jews—individually and as a group—that can be attributed to the Jewish religion and/or ethnicity."&lt;ref name=USDS&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/40258.htm "Report on Global Anti-Semitism"''], [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], January 5, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In an extreme form, it "attributes to the Jews an exceptional position among all other civilizations, defames them as an inferior group and denies their being part of the nation[s]" in which they reside.&lt;ref&gt;Pauley, Bruce F. [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PFdSsmxFl7sC&amp;pg=PA1 ''From Prejudice to Persecution: A History of Austrian Anti-Semitism''], University of North Carolina Press, 2002. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; A person who holds such views is called an "antisemite".
Antisemitism may be manifested in many ways, ranging from expressions of hatred of or [[discrimination]] against individual Jews to organized [[pogroms|violent attacks]] by mobs, or even state police, or military attacks on entire Jewish communities. Extreme instances of [[Persecution of Jews|persecution]] include the pogroms which preceded the [[Persecution of Jews in the First Crusade|First Crusade]] in 1096, the [[Edict of Expulsion|expulsion from England]] in 1290, the [[History_of_the_Jews_in_Spain#Massacre_of_1391|massacres of Spanish Jews]] in 1391, the persecutions of the [[Spanish Inquisition]], the [[Alhambra decree|expulsion from Spain]] in 1492, the [[Jews in Portugal|expulsion from Portugal]] in 1497, various [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian]] [[pogroms]], the [[Dreyfus Affair]], and [[the Final Solution]] by [[Nazi Germany|Hitler's Germany]] and official [[History of the Jews in the Soviet Union|Soviet]] anti-Jewish policies.

While the term's [[etymology]] might suggest that antisemitism is directed against all [[Semitic#Ancient Semitic peoples|Semitic peoples]], the term was coined in the late 19th century in Germany as a more scientific-sounding term for ''Judenhass'' ("Jew-hatred"),&lt;ref name=Judenhass&gt;See, for example:

==Etymology and usage==
===Usage===
Despite the use of the prefix ''anti-'', the terms ''Semitic'' and ''anti-Semitic'' are not directly opposed to each other. ''Antisemitism'' refers specifically to prejudice against [[Jew]]s alone and in general,&lt;ref name=JustJews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antisemitism Antisemitism – Definition and More from the Merriam-Webster Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that there are other speakers of [[Semitic language]]s (e.g. [[Arab]]s, [[Ethiopians]], or [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]) and that not all Jews speak a Semitic language.

The term ''anti-Semitic'' has been used on occasion to include bigotry against other Semitic-language peoples such as Arabs, but such usage is not widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Matas|Matas, David]]. [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DYR7SqcMe9gC&amp;pg=PA34 ''Aftershock: Anti-Zionism and Antisemitism''], Dundurn Press, 2005, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Both terms ''anti-Semitism'' and ''antisemitism'' are in common use. Some scholars favor the unhyphenated form ''antisemitism'' to avoid possible confusion involving whether the term refers specifically to Jews, or to [[Semitic]]-language speakers as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.facinghistory.org/campus/reslib.nsf/99ca830bb4f483948525717f005abfc7/2820f36c177cc758852571860065e8c2/$FILE/complete_antisemitism.pdf Antisemitism.

===Etymology===
[[Image:Bookcover-1880-Marr-German uber Juden.jpg|thumb|Cover page of Marr's ''The Way to Victory of Germanicism over Judaism'', 1880 edition]]
Although [[Wilhelm Marr]] is generally credited with coining the word ''anti-Semitism'' (see below), [[Alex Bein]] writes that the word was first used in 1860 by the Austrian Jewish scholar [[Moritz Steinschneider]] in the phrase "anti-Semitic prejudices".&lt;ref&gt;[[Alex Bein|Bein, Alex]]. [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cQOn0y8ENg4C&amp;pg=PA594 ''The Jewish Question: Biography of a World Problem'']. Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;594. ISBN 0-8386-3252-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Steinschneider used this phrase to characterize [[Ernest Renan]]'s ideas about how "[[Semitic]] races" were inferior to "[[Aryan]] races." These [[Pseudoscience|pseudo-scientific]] theories concerning race, civilization, and "progress" had become quite widespread in Europe in the second half of the 19th century, especially as [[Prussia]]n nationalistic historian [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] did much to promote this form of racism. He coined the term "the Jews are our misfortune" which would later be widely used by [[National Socialism|Nazis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Leon Poliakov|Poliakov, Leon]] ''[[The History of Anti-Semitism]], Volume 3: From Voltaire to Wagner'', University of Pennsylvania Press: 2003, page 404 [[ISBN-13]]: 978-0812218657&lt;/ref&gt;  In Treitschke's writings ''Semitic'' was synonymous with ''Jewish'', in contrast to its use by Renan and others.

In 1873 German journalist [[Wilhelm Marr]] published a pamphlet ''"The Victory of the Jewish Spirit over the Germanic Spirit. Observed from a non-religious perspective."'' (''"Der Sieg des Judenthums über das Germanenthum. Vom nicht confessionellen Standpunkt aus betrachtet."'')&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Marr|Marr, Wilhelm]]. [http://www.archive.org/details/DerSiegdesJudenthumsueberdasGermanenthum|Der Sieg des Judenthums über das Germanenthum. Vom nicht confessionellen Standpunkt aus betrachtet.] Rudolph Costenoble. 1879, 8th edition. Archive.org.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he used the word ''"Semitismus"'' interchangeably with the word "Judentum" to denote both "Jewry" (the Jews as a collective) and "jewishness" (the quality of being Jewish, or the Jewish spirit). Although he did not use the word "Antisemitismus" in the pamphlet, the coining of the latter word followed naturally from the word "Semitismus", and indicated either opposition to the Jews as a people, or else opposition to Jewishness or the Jewish spirit, which he saw as infiltrating German culture. In his next pamphlet, ''"The Way to Victory of the Germanic Spirit over the Jewish Spirit"'', published in 1880, Marr developed his ideas further and coined the related German word ''Antisemitismus'' – ''antisemitism'', derived from the word "Semitismus" that he had earlier used.

The pamphlet became very popular, and in the same year he founded the ''"League of Antisemites"'' ("''Antisemiten-Liga''"), the first German organization committed specifically to combatting the alleged threat to Germany and German culture posed by the Jews and their influence, and advocating their [[population transfer|forced removal]] from the country.

So far as can be ascertained, the word was first widely printed in 1881, when Marr published ''"Zwanglose Antisemitische Hefte,"'' and [[Wilhelm Scherer]] used the term "''Antisemiten''" in the January issue of ''"Neue Freie Presse"''. The related word ''[[Philo-Semitism|semitism]]'' was coined around 1885.

===Definition===
Though the general definition of antisemitism is hostility or prejudice against Jews, a number of authorities have developed more formal definitions. Holocaust scholar and [[City University of New York]] professor [[Helen Fein]] defines it as "a persisting latent structure of hostile beliefs towards Jews as a collective manifested in individuals as attitudes, and in culture as myth, ideology, folklore and imagery, and in actions – social or legal discrimination, political mobilization against the Jews, and collective or state violence – which results in and/or is designed to distance, displace, or destroy Jews as Jews." Elaborating on Fein's definition, Dietz Bering of the [[University of Cologne]] writes that, to antisemites, "Jews are not only partially but totally bad by nature, that is, their bad traits are incorrigible. Because of this bad nature: (1) Jews have to be seen not as individuals but as a collective. (2) Jews remain essentially alien in the surrounding societies. (3) Jews bring disaster on their 'host societies' or on the whole world, they are doing it secretly, therefore the antisemites feel obliged to unmask the conspiratorial, bad Jewish character."&lt;ref&gt;Avner, Falk. [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zL_0WOiZj0oC&amp;pg=PA5 ''Anti-semitism: a history and psychoanalysis of contemporary hatred''], [[Greenwood Publishing Group]], 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Antisemiticroths.jpg|thumb|right|Antisemitic caricature by C.Léandre (France, 1898)]]
[[Bernard Lewis]] defines antisemitism as a special case of prejudice, hatred, or persecution directed against people who are in some way different from the rest. According to Lewis, antisemitism is marked by two distinct features: Jews are judged according to a standard different from that applied to others, and they are accused of "cosmic evil." Thus, "it is perfectly possible to hate and even to persecute Jews without necessarily being anti-Semitic" unless this hatred or persecution displays one of the two features specific to antisemitism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]]. [http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/21832.html "The New Anti-Semitism"], ''The American Scholar'', Volume 75 No. 1, Winter 2006, pp. 25–36. The paper is based on a lecture delivered at [[Brandeis University]] on March 24, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of efforts by international and governmental bodies to define antisemitism formally. The U.S. Department of State defines antisemitism in its 2005 Report on Global Anti-Semitism as "hatred toward Jews—individually and as a group—that can be attributed to the Jewish religion and/or ethnicity."&lt;ref name="USDS"/&gt;

In 2005, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (now [[Fundamental Rights Agency]]), then an agency of the [[European Union]], developed a more detailed [[EUMC Working Definition of Antisemitism|working definition]], which states: "Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities." It adds "such manifestations could also target the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity." It provides contemporary examples of antisemitism, which include: promoting the harming of Jews in the name of an ideology or religion; promoting negative stereotypes of Jews; holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of an individual Jewish person or group; [[Holocaust denial|denying the Holocaust]] or accusing Jews or Israel of exaggerating it; and accusing Jews of [[dual loyalty]] or a greater allegiance to Israel than their own country. It also lists ways in which attacking Israel could be antisemitic, e.g.  by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor, or applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation, or holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the State of Israel.&lt;ref name=workingdef&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/material/pub/AS/AS-WorkingDefinition-draft.pdf "Working definition of antisemitism"]|33.8&amp;nbsp;KB}}, EUMC.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of usage as a term===
In 1879, [[Wilhelm Marr]] founded the ''Antisemiten-Liga'' (Antisemitic League). Identification with antisemitism and as an antisemite was politically advantageous in Europe in the latter 19th century. For example, [[Karl Lueger]], the popular mayor of [[fin de siècle]] [[Vienna]], skillfully exploited antisemitism as a way of channeling public discontent to his political advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Geehr. ''Karl Lueger, Mayor of Fin-de-Siècle Vienna'', Wayne State University Press, Detroit, 1989. ISBN 0-8143-2055-4&lt;/ref&gt; In its 1910 obituary of Lueger, ''The New York Times'' notes that Lueger was "Chairman of the Christian Social Union of the Parliament and of the Anti-Semitic Union of the Diet of Lower Austria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9404E7D91E30E333A25752C1A9659C946196D6CF Dr. Karl Lueger Dead; Anti-Semitic Leader and Mayor of Vienna Was 66 Years Old.] ''The New York Times'', March 11, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895 [[A. C. Cuza]] organized the ''Alliance Anti-semitique Universelle'' in Bucharest. In the period before [[World War II]], when animosity towards Jews was far more commonplace, it was not uncommon for a person, organization, or political party to self-identify as an antisemite or antisemitic.

The early Zionist pioneer, [[Judah Leib Pinsker]], in a pamphlet written in 1882, said that antisemitism was an inherited predisposition:{{quote|Judeophobia is a psychic aberration. As a psychic aberration it is hereditary, and as a disease transmitted for two thousand years it is incurable.' ... 'In this way have Judaism and Anti-Semitism passed for centuries through history as inseparable companions.'... ...'Having analyzed Judeophobia as an hereditary form of demonopathy, peculiar to the human race, and having represented Anti-Semitism as proceeding from an inherited aberration of the human mind, we must draw the important conclusion that we must give' up contending against these hostile impulses as we must against every other inherited predisposition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Auto-Emancipation|''Auto-Emancipation'' by Judah Leib Pinsker]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the aftermath of [[Kristallnacht]], [[Josef Goebbels|Goebbels]] announced: "The German people is anti-Semitic. It has no desire to have its rights restricted or to be provoked in the future by parasites of the Jewish race."&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Telegraph'', November 12, 1938. Cited in [[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Kristallnacht: Prelude to Destruction.'' Harper Collins, 2006, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Hitler]]'s fall from power, and particularly after the extent of the [[Nazi]] [[genocide]] of Jews became known, the term "antisemitism" acquired [[pejorative]] connotations. This marked a full circle shift in usage, from an era just decades earlier when "Jew" was used as a pejorative term.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Rader Marcus. ''United States Jewry, 1776–1985.'' Wayne State University Press, 1989, page 286. ISBN 0-8143-2186-0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Bein. ''The Jewish Question: Biography of a World Problem''. Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1990, Page 580. ISBN 0-8386-3252-1&lt;/ref&gt; Yehuda Bauer wrote in 1984: "There are no antisemites in the world... Nobody says, 'I am antisemitic.'" You cannot, after Hitler. The word has gone out of fashion."&lt;ref&gt;[[Yehuda Bauer]]: ''The Most Ancient Group Prejudice'' in Leo Eitinger (1984): ''The Anti-Semitism of Our Time''. Oslo. Nansen Committee. p.14. citing from: Jocelyn Hellig (2003): ''The Holocaust and Antisemitism: A Short History.'' Oneworld Publications. p.&amp;nbsp;73. ISBN 1-85168-313-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often emphasized that there are different forms of antisemitism.  René König mentions social antisemitism, economic antisemitism, religious antisemitism, and political antisemitism as examples.  König points out that these different forms demonstrate that the "origins of antisemitic prejudices are rooted in different historical periods."  König asserts that differences in the chronology of different antisemitic prejudices and the irregular distribution of such prejudices over different segments of the population create "serious difficulties in the definition of the different kinds of antisemitism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Materialien zur Kriminalsoziologie |first=René |last= König |publisher=VS Verlag |year=2004 |page=231 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=N9oL2cljv8QC&amp;pg=PA231&amp;dq=%22economic+antisemitism%22+%22religious+antisemitism%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22economic%20antisemitism%22%20%22religious%20antisemitism%22&amp;f=false |isbn=9783810033062}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These difficulties may contribute to the existence of different taxonomies that have been developed to categorize the forms of antisemitism.  The forms identified are substantially the same; it is primarily the number of forms and their definitions that differ.  Bernard Lazare identifies three forms of antisemitism: Christian antisemitism, economic antisemitism, and ethnologic antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anti-Semitism: Its History and Causes |first=Bernard |last=Lazare |publisher=Cosimo, Inc. |year=2006 |page=224|url=http://books.google.com/?id=VP81v2Y24HUC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;lpg=PA224&amp;dq=religious+antisemitism+%22economic+antisemitism%22#v=onepage&amp;q=religious%20antisemitism%20%22economic%20antisemitism%22&amp;f=false |isbn=9781596056015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
William Brustein names four categories: religious, racial, economic and political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Roots of hate: anti-semitism in Europe before the Holocaust |first=William |last=Brustein |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |page=46 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Hc3HabBQsdsC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=antisemitism+economic+racial+religious#v=onepage&amp;q=antisemitism%20economic%20racial%20religious&amp;f=false |isbn=9780521774789}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Roman Catholic]] historian [[Edward Flannery]] distinguished four varieties of antisemitism:&lt;ref&gt;Flannery, Edward H. ''The Anguish of the Jews: Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism'', Stimulus Books, first published 1965, this edition 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2010}}
*political and economic antisemitism, giving as examples [[Cicero]] and [[Charles Lindbergh]];
*[[Religious antisemitism|theological or religious antisemitism]], sometimes known as [[anti-Judaism]];
*nationalistic antisemitism, citing [[Voltaire]] and other [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers, who attacked Jews for supposedly having certain characteristics, such as greed and arrogance, and for observing customs such as [[kashrut]] and [[Shabbat]];
*and [[racial antisemitism]], with its extreme form resulting in the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] by the [[Nazi]]s.

Louis Harap provides a similar list that separates out "economic antisemitism" and merges "political" and "nationalistic" antisemitism into what Harap terms as "ideological antisemitism".  Harap also adds a category of "social antisemitism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Creative awakening: the Jewish presence in twentieth-century American literature, 1900-1940s |first=Louis |last=Harap |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1987 |page=24|url=http://books.google.com/?id=mAPvam-n_DYC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=%22Economic+Jew%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Economic%20Jew%22&amp;f=false |isbn=9780313253867}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* religious (Jew as Christ-killer),
* economic (Jew as banker, usurer, money-obsessed),
* social (Jew as social inferior, "pushy," vulgar, therefore excluded from personal contact),
* racist (Jews as an inferior "race"),
* ideological (Jews regarded as subversive or revolutionary),
* cultural (Jews regarded as undermining the moral and structural fiber of civilization).

===Cultural antisemitism===

Louis Harap defines cultural antisemitism as "that species of anti-Semitism that charges the Jews with corrupting a given culture and attempting to supplant or succeeding in supplanting the preferred culture with a uniform, crude, "Jewish" culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Creative awakening: the Jewish presence in twentieth-century American literature |first=Louis |last=Harap |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1987 |page=76 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=mAPvam-n_DYC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=Harap+%22cultural+anti+semitism%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=9780313253867}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, Eric Kandel characterizes cultural antisemitism as being based on the idea of “Jewishness” as a "religious or cultural tradition that is acquired through learning, through distinctive traditions and education."  According to Kandel, this form of antisemitism views Jews as possessing "unattractive psychological and social characteristics that are acquired through acculturation."&lt;ref name=Kandel30&gt;{{cite book |title=In search of memory: the emergence of a new science of mind |first=Eric R. |last=Kandel |publisher=W.

An important feature of cultural antisemitism is that it considers the negative attributes of Judaism to be redeemable by education or religious  conversion.&lt;ref name=Kandel3031&gt;{{cite book |title=In search of memory: the emergence of a new science of mind |first=Eric R. |last=Kandel |publisher=W.

===Religious antisemitism===
{{main|Religious antisemitism}}
{{See also|Anti-Judaism|Christianity and antisemitism|Islam and antisemitism}}

Religious antisemitism is also known as anti-Judaism.  Under this version of antisemitism, attacks would often stop if Jews stopped practicing or changed their public faith, especially by [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to the official or right religion, and sometimes, liturgical exclusion of Jewish converts (the case of Christianized ''[[Marranos]]'' or Iberian Jews in the late 15th century and 16th century convicted of secretly practising Judaism or Jewish customs).&lt;ref name=Flannery&gt;Flannery, Edward H. ''The Anguish of the Jews: Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism'', Stimulus Books, first published 1985, this edition 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the origins of antisemitism are rooted in the religious conflict between Christianity and Judaism, religious antisemitism has largely been supplanted in the modern era by other forms of antisemitism.  Frederick Schweitzer asserts that, "most scholars ignore the Christian foundation on which the modern antisemitic edifice rests and invoke political antisemitism, cultural antisemitism, racism or racial antisemitism, economic antisemitism and the like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A concise history of American antisemitism |first=Robert |last=Michael |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2005|page=vii |url=http://books.google.com/?id=5G3feplFBYUC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=%22Cultural+antisemitism%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Cultural%20antisemitism%22&amp;f=false |isbn=9780742543133}}&lt;/ref&gt;  William Nichols draws a distinction between religious antisemitism and modern antisemitism which is based on racial or ethnic grounds.  Nichols writes, "The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion . . . a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon baptism."  From the perspective of racial antisemitism, however, "... the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism ... . From the Enlightenment onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews... Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear."

===Economic antisemitism===
{{main|Economic antisemitism}}

The underlying premise of economic antisemitism is that Jews perform harmful economic activities or that economic activities become harmful when they are performed by Jews.&lt;ref name=MeyerBrenner220&gt;{{cite book |title=German-Jewish History in Modern Times: Integration in dispute, 1871–1918 |publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1998 |page=220 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=HFFoSglsovoC&amp;pg=PA220&amp;dq=economic+antisemitism#v=onepage&amp;q=economic%20antisemitism&amp;f=false |isbn=9780231074766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegations regarding the relationship of Jews and money have been characterized as underpinning the most damaging and lasting [[antisemitic canards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jews &amp; Money – The story of a stereotype|url=http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/jewsandmoney/default.asp|accessdate=2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antisemite]]s have often promulgated myths related to money, such as the [[canard]] that Jews control the world finances, first promoted in the [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]], and later repeated by [[Henry Ford]] and his [[Dearborn Independent]].   In the modern era, many such myths continue to be widespread in books such as [[The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews]] published by the [[Nation of Islam]], and on the internet.
[[File:Der Stürmer Christmas 1929.jpg|thumb|A caricature from the German antisemitic ''[[Der Stürmer]]'', around Christmas 1929. It urged Germans to avoid buying from Jewish shops.]]
[[Derek Penslar]] writes that there are two components to the financial [[Antisemitic canards|canards]]:&lt;ref&gt;Penslar, p 5&lt;/ref&gt;
:a) Jews are savages that "are temperamentally incapable of performing honest labor"
:b) Jews are "leaders of a financial cabal seeking world domination"

[[Abraham Foxman]] describes six facets of the financial canards:
#All Jews are wealthy &lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p 84&lt;/ref&gt;
#Jews are stingy and greedy&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p 89&lt;/ref&gt;
#Powerful Jews control business world&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p 93&lt;/ref&gt;
#Jewish religion emphasizes profit and materialism&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p 98&lt;/ref&gt;
#It is okay for Jews to cheat non-Jews&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p 102&lt;/ref&gt;
#Jews use their power to benefit "their own kind"&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p 105&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerald Krefetz summarizes the myth as "[Jews] control the banks, the money supply, the economy, and businesses – of the community, of the country, of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz, p 45&lt;/ref&gt;  Krefetz gives, as illustrations, many slurs and proverbs (in several different languages) which suggest that Jews are stingy, or greedy, or miserly, or aggressive bargainers.&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz, p 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; Krefetz suggests that during the nineteenth century, most of the myths focused on Jews being "scurrilous, stupid, and tight-fisted", but following the [[Jewish Emancipation]] and the rise of Jews to the middle- or upper-class in Europe the myths evolved and began to assert that Jews were "clever, devious, and manipulative financiers out to dominate [world finances]".&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz, p 47&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leon Poliakov]] asserts that economic antisemitism is not a distinct form of antisemitism, but merely a manifestation of theologic antisemitism (because, without the theological causes of the economic antisemitism, there would be no economic antisemitism).   In opposition to this view, Derek Penslar contends that in the modern era, the economic antisemitism is "distinct and nearly constant" but theological antisemitism is "often subdued".&lt;ref&gt;Penslar, p 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial antisemitism===
{{main|Racial antisemitism}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-267-0111-36, Russland, russische Kriegsgefangene (Juden).jpg|thumb|190px|Soviet prisoner of war, August 1941. At least 50,000 Jewish soldiers were shot after selection.]]
[[Racial antisemitism]] is prejudice against [[Jew]]s as a racial/ethnic group, rather than [[Judaism]] as a religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1603&amp;letter=A&amp;search=Anti-semitism "Anti-Semitism"], [[Jewish Encyclopedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial antisemitism is the idea that the Jews are a distinct and inferior race compared to their host nations. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, it gained mainstream acceptance as part of the [[eugenics]] movement, which categorized non-"Europeans" as inferior. It more specifically claimed that the "Nordic" Europeans were superior. Racial antisemites saw the Jews as part of a Semitic race and emphasized their "alien" extra-European origins and culture. They saw Jews as beyond redemption even if they converted to the majority religion. Anthropologists discussed whether the Jews possessed any Arabic-[[Armenoid]], African-[[Nubian people|Nubian]] or Asian-[[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] ancestries.

Racial antisemitism replaced the hatred of Judaism with the hatred of Jews as a group. In the context of the [[Industrial Revolution]], following the [[Jewish Emancipation|emancipation of the Jews]], Jews rapidly urbanized and experienced a period of greater social mobility. With the decreasing role of religion in public life tempering religious antisemitism, a combination of growing [[nationalism]], the rise of [[eugenics]], and resentment at the socio-economic success of the Jews led to the newer, and more virulent, racist antisemitism.

According to William Nichols, religious antisemitism may be distinguished from modern antisemitism based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] or [[ethnicity|ethnic]] grounds. "The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion . . . a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon baptism." However, with racial antisemitism, "Now the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism ... . From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews... Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving  behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear."&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, William: ''Christian Antisemitism, A History of Hate'' (1993) p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, a number of laws enabling [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation of the Jews]] were enacted in Western European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Webster (2001)''Petain's Crime''. London, Pan Books: 13, 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Cohn-Sherbok (2006) ''The Paradox of Anti-Semitism''. Continuum: 44–46&lt;/ref&gt; The old laws restricting them to [[ghetto]]s, as well as the many laws that limited their property rights, rights of worship and occupation, were rescinded.  Despite this, traditional discrimination and hostility to Jews on religious grounds persisted and was supplemented by [[racial antisemitism]], encouraged by the work of racial theorists such as [[Joseph Arthur de Gobineau]] and particularly his ''Essay on the Inequality of the Human Race'' of 1853–5.[[Nationalist]] agendas based on [[ethnicity]], known as [[ethnonationalism]], usually excluded the Jews from the national community as an alien race.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Beller (2007)''Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction'': 64&lt;/ref&gt; Allied to this were theories of [[Social Darwinism]], which stressed a putative conflict between higher and lower races of human beings. Such theories, usually posited by white Europeans, advocated the superiority of white [[Aryan]]s to [[Semitic]] Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Beller (2007) ''Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction'': pp 57–9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political antisemitism===
{{Expand section|date=June 2011}}

William Brustein defines political antisemitism as hostility toward Jews based on the belief that Jews seek national and/or world power."  Yisrael Gutman characterizes political antisemitism as tending to "lay responsibility on the Jews for defeats and political economic crises" while seeking to "exploit opposition and resistance to Jewish influence as elements in political party platforms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Genocide, critical issues of the Holocaust: a companion to the film, Genocide |publisher=Behrman House, Inc |year=1983 |page=100 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=DcdiVs9lwvcC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=%22political+antisemitism%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22political%20antisemitism%22&amp;f=false |isbn=9780940646049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Viktor Karády, political antisemitism became widespread after the legal [[emancipation of the Jews]] and sought to reverse some of the consequences of that emancipation.

===New antisemitism===
{{Main|New antisemitism}}

Starting in the 1990s, some scholars have advanced the concept of ''New antisemitism'', coming simultaneously from the [[Left-wing politics|left]], the [[Right-wing politics|right]], and [[Islamism|radical Islam]], which tends to focus on opposition to the creation of a Jewish homeland in the [[State of Israel]],&lt;ref name="New-AS-List"&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of antisemitism}}

Many authors see the roots of economic antisemitism in both pagan antiquity and early Christianity.  
[[Jerome Chanes]] identifies six stages in the historical development of antisemitism:
#Pre-Christian anti-Judaism in ancient Greece and Rome which was primarily ethnic in nature
#Christian anti-semitism in antiquity and the Middle Ages which was religious in nature and has extended into modern times
#Traditional Muslim antisemitism which was – at least in its classical form – nuanced in that  Jews were a protected class
#Political, social and economic antisemitism of Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment Europe which laid the groundwork for racial antisemitism
#Racial antisemitism that arose in the 19th century and culminated in Nazism
#Contemporary antisemitism which has been labeled by some as the [[New Antisemitism]]

Chanes suggests that these six stages could be merged into three categories: "ancient antisemitism, which was primarily ethnic in nature; Christian antisemitism, which was religious; and the racial antisemitism of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."&lt;ref name=Chanes5&gt;{{cite book |title=Antisemitism: a reference handbook |first=Jerome A. |last=Chanes|publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2004 |pages=5–6 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ju7U83nRDt8C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22economic+antisemitism%22+antiquity#v=onepage&amp;q=%22economic%20antisemitism%22%20antiquity&amp;f=false |isbn=9781576072097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient world===

The first clear examples of anti-Jewish sentiment can be traced back to [[Alexandria]] in the 3rd century [[BCE]].&lt;ref name=Flannery&gt;Flannery, Edward H. ''The Anguish of the Jews: Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism''. Paulist Press, first published in 1985; this edition 2004, pp. 11–2. ISBN 0-8091-2702-4. [[Edward Flannery]]&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandria was home to the largest Jewish community in the world and the [[Septuagint]], a Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]], was produced there. [[Manetho]], an Egyptian priest and historian of that time, wrote scathingly of the Jews and his themes are repeated in the works of [[Chaeremon]], [[Lysimachus]], [[Poseidonius]], [[Apollonius Molon]], and in [[Apion]] and [[Tacitus]].&lt;ref name=Flannery /&gt; [[Agatharchides of Cnidus]] ridiculed the practices of the Jews and the "absurdity of [[Torah|their Law]]", making a mocking reference to how [[Ptolemy Lagus]] was able to invade [[Jerusalem]] in 320 BCE because its inhabitants were observing the ''[[Shabbat]]''.&lt;ref name=Flannery /&gt; One of the earliest anti-Jewish [[edict]]s, promulgated by [[Antiochus Epiphanes]] in about 170–167 BCE, sparked a revolt of the [[Maccabees]] in [[Judea]].

In view of Manetho's anti-Jewish writings, antisemitism may have originated in Egypt and been spread by "the [[Greeks|Greek]] retelling of [[Ancient Egypt]]ian prejudices".&lt;ref name="Schäfer"&gt;Schäfer, Peter. ''Judeophobia'', Harvard University Press, 1997, p 208.[[Peter Schaefer (author)|Peter Schäfer]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Jewish philosopher [[Philo of Alexandria]] describes an attack on Jews in Alexandria in 38 CE in which thousands of Jews died.&lt;ref name=Barclay&gt;Barclay, John M G, 1999.

''Philo's Flaccus: the First Pogrom'', Philo of Alexandria Commentary Series, Brill. [[Pieter Willem van der Horst]]&lt;/ref&gt; Tcherikover argues that the reason for hatred of Jews in the Hellenistic period was their separateness in the Greek cities, the ''[[polis|poleis]]''.&lt;ref name=tcherikover&gt;Tcherikover, Victor, ''Hellenistic Civilization and the Jews'', New York: Atheneum, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Bohak has argued, however, that early animosity against the Jews cannot be regarded as being anti-Judaic or antisemitic unless it arose from attitudes that were held against the Jews alone, and that many Greeks showed animosity toward any group they regarded as barbarians.&lt;ref name=Bohak&gt;Bohak, Gideon. "The Ibis and the Jewish Question: Ancient 'Antisemitism' in Historical Context" in Menachem Mor et al., ''Jews and Gentiles in the Holy Land in the Days of the Second Temple, the Mishna and the Talmud'', Yad Ben-Zvi Press, 2003, p 27–43.&lt;/ref&gt;
Statements exhibiting prejudice against Jews and their religion can be found in the works of many [[pagan]] [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels. J,L,''Anti-Semitism in the Hellenistic-Roman Period'' in JBL 98 (1979) pp.45–65&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Flannery writes that it was the Jews' refusal to accept Greek religious and social standards that marked them out. Hecataetus of Abdera, a Greek historian of the early third century BCE, wrote that Moses "in remembrance of the exile of his people, instituted for them a misanthropic and inhospitable way of life." [[Manetho]], an Egyptian historian, wrote that the Jews were expelled Egyptian [[Leprosy|lepers]] who had been taught by [[Moses]] "not to adore the gods." The same themes appeared in the works of [[Chaeremon]], [[Lysimachus]], [[Poseidonius]], [[Apollonius Molon]], and in [[Apion]] and [[Tacitus]]. [[Agatharchides of Cnidus]] wrote about the "ridiculous practices" of the Jews and of the "absurdity of their Law" and how [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy Lagus]] was able to invade [[Jerusalem]] in 320 BC because its inhabitants were observing the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]].&lt;ref name=Flannery&gt;Flannery, Edward H. ''The Anguish of the Jews: Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism''. Paulist Press, first published in 1985; this edition 2004, pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Edward Flannery describes antisemitism in ancient times as essentially "cultural, taking the shape of a national xenophobia played out in political settings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The anguish of the Jews: twenty-three centuries of antisemitism |first=Edward H. |last=Flannery |publisher=Paulist Press |year=1985 |page=25 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=J40gNC7cxfYC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=%22economic+antisemitism%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22economic%20antisemitism%22&amp;f=false |isbn=9780809143245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are examples of [[Hellenistic]] rulers desecrating the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] and banning Jewish religious practices, such as [[circumcision]], Shabbat observance, study of Jewish religious books, etc. Examples may also be found in anti-Jewish riots in [[Alexandria]] in the 3rd century BCE. [[Philo of Alexandria]] described an attack on Jews in Alexandria in 38 CE in which thousands of Jews died.

The Jewish diaspora on the [[Nile River|Nile]] island [[Elephantine]], which was founded by mercenaries, experienced the destruction of its temple in 410 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Colpe, Carsten (Berlin).

Relationships between the Jewish people and the occupying [[Roman Empire]] were at times antagonistic and resulted in [[Jewish-Roman wars|several rebellions]]. According to [[Suetonius]], the emperor [[Tiberius]] expelled from Rome Jews who had gone to live there. The 18th century English historian [[Edward Gibbon]] identified a more tolerant period in Roman-Jewish relations beginning in about 160 CE {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. However, when Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire, the state's attitude towards the Jews [[History_of_antisemitism#Late_Roman_Empire|gradually worsened]].

[[James Carroll (novelist)|James Carroll]] asserted: "Jews accounted for 10% of the total population of the [[Roman Empire]]. By that ratio, if other factors such as [[pogrom]]s and [[forced conversion|conversion]]s had not intervened, there would be 200 million Jews in the world today, instead of something like 13 million."&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, James.

During the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe there was persecution against Jews in many places, with [[blood libel]]s, expulsions, [[forced conversion]]s and [[massacre]]s. A main justification of prejudice against Jews in Europe was religious. The persecution hit its first peak during the [[Crusades]]. In the [[First Crusade]] (1096) flourishing communities on the [[Rhine]] and the [[Danube]] [[German Crusade, 1096|were destroyed]]. In the [[Second Crusade]] (1147) the Jews in Germany were subject to several massacres. The Jews were also subjected to attacks by the [[Shepherds' Crusade]]s of 1251 and 1320. The Crusades were followed by expulsions, including, in 1290, the banishing of all [[English people|English]] Jews; in 1396, the expulsion of 100,000 Jews in France; and in 1421, the expulsion of thousands from Austria. Many of the expelled Jews fled to Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holocaustcenterpgh.net/2-3.html Why the Jews? – Black Death]&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval and Renaissance Europe, a major contributor to the deepening of antisemitic sentiment and legal action among the Christian populations was the popular preaching of the zealous reform religious orders, the Franciscans (especially Bernardino of Feltre) and Dominicans (especially Vincent Ferrer), who combed European promoting antisemitism through their often fiery, emotional appeals.&lt;ref&gt;Franco Mormando, ''The Preacher's Demons: Bernardino of Siena and the Social Underworld of Early Renaissance Italy'', Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1999, Chapter Two.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Black Death]] epidemics devastated Europe in the mid-14th century, annihilating more than half of the population, Jews were used as [[scapegoating#Psychology and sociology|scapegoats]]. Rumors spread that they caused the disease by deliberately poisoning wells. Hundreds of Jewish communities were destroyed. Although [[Pope Clement VI]] tried to protect them by the July 6, 1348, [[papal bull]] and an additional bull in 1348, several months later, 900 Jews were burned alive in [[Strasbourg]], where the plague had not yet affected the city.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;See Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, ''La plus grande épidémie de l'histoire'' ("The greatest epidemics in history"), in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' magazine, n°310, June 2006, p.47 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seventeenth century===
During the mid-to-late 17th century the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was devastated by several conflicts, in which the Commonwealth lost over a third of its population (over 3 million people), and Jewish losses were counted in hundreds of thousands. First, the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]] when [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]'s [[Cossacks]] massacred tens of thousands of [[History of Jews in Poland|Jews]] in the eastern and southern areas he controlled (today's [[Ukraine]]). The precise number of dead may never be known, but the decrease of the Jewish population during that period is estimated at 100,000 to 200,000, which also includes emigration, deaths from diseases and [[Slavery (Ottoman Empire)|captivity in the Ottoman Empire]], called ''jasyr''.&lt;ref&gt;"Bogdan Chmelnitzki leads Cossack uprising against Polish rule; 100,000 Jews are killed and hundreds of Jewish communities are destroyed."

===Enlightenment===
In 1744, [[Frederick II of Prussia]] limited the number of Jews allowed to live in [[Breslau]] to only ten so-called "protected" Jewish families and encouraged a similar practice in other [[Prussia]]n cities. In 1750 he issued the ''Revidiertes General Privilegium und Reglement vor die Judenschaft'': the "protected" Jews had an alternative to "either abstain from marriage or leave Berlin" (quoting [[Simon Dubnow]]). In the same year, Archduchess of Austria [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] ordered Jews out of [[Bohemia]] but soon reversed her position, on the condition that Jews pay for their readmission every ten years. This [[extortion]] was known as ''malke-geld'' (queen's money). In 1752 she introduced the law limiting each Jewish family to one son. In 1782, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] abolished most of these persecution practices in his ''[[Toleranzpatent]]'', on the condition that [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] were eliminated from public records and that judicial autonomy was annulled. [[Moses Mendelssohn]] wrote that "Such a tolerance... is even more dangerous play in tolerance than open persecution."

In 1772, the empress of Russia [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] forced the Jews of the [[Pale of Settlement]] to stay in their [[shtetls]] and forbade them from returning to the towns that they occupied before the [[partition of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Poland.html The Virtual Jewish History Tour By Rebecca Weiner]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic antisemitism in the nineteenth century===
Historian [[Martin Gilbert]] writes that it was in the 19th century that the position of Jews worsened in Muslim countries. [[Benny Morris]] writes that one symbol of Jewish degradation was the phenomenon of stone-throwing at Jews by Muslim children. Morris quotes a 19th century traveler: "I have seen a little fellow of six years old, with a troop of fat toddlers of only three and four, teaching [them] to throw stones at a Jew, and one little urchin would, with the greatest coolness, waddle up to the man and literally spit upon his Jewish [[gaberdine]]. To all this the Jew is obliged to submit; it would be more than his life was worth to offer to strike a Mahommedan."&lt;ref name=Morris10&gt;[[Benny Morris|Morris, Benny]]. ''Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881–2001''. Vintage Books, 2001, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secular or racial antisemitism===

In 1850 the German composer [[Richard Wagner]] published ''[[Das Judenthum in der Musik]]'' ("Jewishness in Music") under a [[pseudonym]] in the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]''. The essay began as an attack on Jewish composers, particularly Wagner's contemporaries (and rivals) [[Felix Mendelssohn]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], but expanded to accuse Jews of being a harmful and alien element in [[Culture of Germany|German culture]]. Antisemitism can also be found in many of the [[Grimms' Fairy Tales]] by [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]], published from 1812 to 1857. It is mainly characterized by Jews being the [[villain]] of a story, such as in "The Good Bargain (Der gute Handel)" and "The Jew Among Thorns (Der Jude im Dorn)."

The [[Dreyfus Affair]] was an infamous antisemitic event of the late 19th century and early 20th century. [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a Jewish artillery captain in the French army, was accused in 1894 of passing secrets to the Germans. As a result of these charges, Dreyfus was convicted and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] at Devil's Island. The actual spy, Marie Charles Esterhazy, was acquitted. The event caused great uproar among the French, with the public choosing sides regarding whether Dreyfus was actually guilty or not. [[Émile Zola]] accused the army of polluting the French justice system. However, general consensus held that Dreyfus was guilty: eighty percent of the press in France condemned him. This attitude among the majority of the French population reveals the underlying antisemitism of the time period.&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, Michael. (2005) Nineteenth Century Europe. New York: Palgrave MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Stoecker]] (1835–1909), the [[Lutheran]] court chaplain to [[Kaiser Wilhelm I]], founded in 1878 an antisemitic, [[antiliberal]] political party called The [[Christian Social Party (Germany)]]. However, this party did not attract as many votes as the Nazi party, which flourished in part because of [[The Great Depression]], which hit Germany especially hard during the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Harold M. Green (2003). "Adolf Stoecker:Portrait of a Demagogue." ''Politics and Policy'''''31'''(1):106–129; D.A. Jeremy Telman (1995) "Adolf Stoecker: Anti-Semite with a Christian Mission."

===Twentieth century===
[[Image:1904 Russian Tsar-Stop your cruel oppression of the Jews-LOC hh0145s.jpg|thumb|left|360px|Russian Tsar-Stop your cruel oppression of the Jews! (1904)]]

Between 1900 and 1924, approximately 1.75 million Jews migrated to America, the bulk from Eastern Europe. Before 1900 American Jews had always amounted to less than 1 percent of America's total population, but by 1930 Jews formed about 3½ percent.  This increase, combined with the upward social mobility of some Jews, contributed to a resurgence of antisemitism.  In the first half of the 20th century, in the USA, Jews were discriminated against in employment, access to residential and resort areas, membership in clubs and organizations, and in tightened quotas on Jewish enrolment and teaching positions in colleges and universities. The lynching of [[Leo Frank]] by a mob of prominent citizens in [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1915 turned the spotlight on antisemitism in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;

In the beginning of 20th century, the [[Menahem Mendel Beilis|Beilis Trial]] in Russia represented incidents of blood-libel in Europe. Christians{{which?|date=November 2011}} used allegations of Jews killing Christians as justification for killing of Jews.

Antisemitism in America reached its peak during the interwar period. The pioneer automobile manufacturer [[Henry Ford]] propagated antisemitic ideas in his newspaper ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]'' (published by Ford from 1919 to 1927). The radio speeches of [[Father Coughlin]] in the late 1930s attacked [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] and promoted the notion of a Jewish financial conspiracy. Some prominent politicians shared such views: [[Louis T. McFadden]], Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Banking and Currency]], blamed Jews for Roosevelt's decision to abandon the [[gold standard]], and claimed that "in the United States today, the Gentiles have the slips of paper while the Jews have the lawful money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arad |first=Gulie Ne'eman |title=America, Its Jews, and the Rise of Nazism |year=2000 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Indianapolis |isbn=0253338093 |page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s the [[aviator]] [[Charles Lindbergh]] and many prominent Americans led The [[America First Committee]] in opposing any involvement in the war against [[Fascism]]. During his July 1936 visit to Germany, he wrote letters saying that there was "more intelligent leadership in Germany than is generally recognized".

The [[German American Bund]] held parades in New York City during the late 1930s, where members wore [[Nazi]] uniforms and raised flags featuring [[swastika]]s alongside American flags. With the start of U.S. involvement in [[World War II]] most of the Bund's members were placed{{by whom|date=November 2011}} in [[internment camp]]s, and some were deported{{by whom|date=November 2011}} at the end of the war.

Sometimes race riots, as in [[Detroit]] in 1943, targeted Jewish businesses for looting and burning.&lt;ref&gt;Capeci Jr., Dominic J.

In Germany the [[National Socialist]] regime of [[Adolf Hitler]], which came to power on 30 January 1933, instituted repressive legislation denying the Jews basic civil rights. It instituted a pogrom on the night of 9–10 November 1938, dubbed ''[[Kristallnacht]]'', in which Jews were killed, their property destroyed and their synagogues torched.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw (2008) ''Fateful Choices'': 441-44
&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemitic laws, agitation and propaganda were extended to Nazi-occupied Europe in the wake of conquest, often building on local antisemitic traditions. In the east the Third Reich forced Jews into ghettos in [[Warsaw]], [[Krakow]], [[Lvov]], [[Lublin]] and [[Radom]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kitchen (2007) ''The Third Reich: A Concise History''.

Antisemitism was commonly used as an instrument for personal conflicts in [[USSR|Soviet Russia]], starting from conflict between [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] and continuing through numerous conspiracy-theories spread by official propaganda. Antisemitism in the USSR reached new heights after 1948 during the campaign against the [[Rootless cosmopolitan|"rootless cosmopolitan"]] (euphemism for "Jew") in which numerous Yiddish-language poets, writers, painters and sculptors were killed or arrested.&lt;ref name="jcws"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Konstantin Azadovskii and Boris Egorov| title=From Anti-Westernism to Anti-Semitism| journal=Journal of Cold War Studies| year=2002| volume=4:1| issue=Winter| pages=66–80| url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hpcws/egorov.htm#REF31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Myth"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of the Jewish Race| coauthors=Raphael and Jennifer Patai| year=1989| page=178| publisher=Wayne State University Press| isbn=0814319483, 9780814319482}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated in the so-called [[Doctors' Plot]] (1952–1953).

A 2007 survey by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) concluded that 15% of Americans hold antisemitic views, which was in-line with the average of the previous ten years, but a decline from the 29% of the early sixties. The survey concluded that education was a strong predictor, “with most educated Americans being remarkably free of prejudicial views.” The belief that Jews have too much power was considered a common anti-Semitic view by the ADL. Other views indicating antisemitism, according to the survey, include the view that Jews are more loyal to Israel than America, and that they are responsible for the death of Christ. The survey found that antisemitic Americans are likely to be intolerant generally, e.g. regarding immigration and free-speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/poll_2007/ ADL Survey: American Attitudes Towards Jews in America]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, the [[U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] examined antisemitism on college campuses. It reported that "incidents of threatened bodily injury, physical intimidation or property damage are now rare", but antisemitism still occurs on many campuses and is a "serious problem." The Commission recommended that the [[U.S. Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]] protect college students from antisemitism through vigorous enforcement of ''Title VI'' of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and further recommended that [[United States Congress|Congress]] clarify that Title VI applies to discrimination against Jewish students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eusccr.com/Ending%20Campus%20Ant-Semitism1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 19, 2006, [[Yale University]] founded the [[Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Anti-Semitism]] (YIISA), the first North American university-based center for study of the subject, as part of its Institution for Social and Policy Studies. Director [[Charles A.

After carrying out a routine review, the faculty review committee said that the initiative had not met its research and teaching standards. Donald Green, who heads Yale’s Institution for Social and Policy Studies, the body under whose aegis the antisemitism initiative was run, said that it had not had many papers published in the relevant leading journals or attracted many students.

According to a 2004 report from the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], antisemitism had increased significantly in Europe since 2000, with significant increases in verbal attacks against Jews and vandalism such as graffiti, fire bombings of Jewish schools, desecration of synagogues and cemeteries. Germany, France, [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and Russia are the countries with the highest rate of antisemitic incidents in Europe.&lt;ref name = "mgjmsp"&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-urban-f04.htm Anti-Semitism In Germany Today: Its Roots And Tendencies – Susanne Urban]&lt;/ref&gt; The Netherlands and Sweden have also consistently had high rates of antisemitic attacks since 2000.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The 2005 U.S. State Department Report on Global Antisemitism.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the new European antisemitic violence can actually be seen as a spill over from the long running [[Arab-Israeli conflict]] since the majority of the perpetrators are from the [[Islam in Europe|large Muslim immigrant communities in European cities]]. However, compared to France, the United Kingdom and much of the rest of Europe, in Germany Arab and pro-Palestinian groups are involved in only a small percentage of antisemitic incidents.&lt;ref name = "mgjmsp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Roth Institute, Tel Aviv University, http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism'', most of the more extreme attacks on Jewish sites and physical attacks on Jews in Europe come from militant Islamic and Muslim groups, and most Jews tend to be assaulted in countries where groups of young Muslim immigrants reside.&lt;ref name=roth&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2004/general-analysis.htm], The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism, Tel Aviv University.

On January 1, 2006, Britain's chief [[rabbi]], Lord [[Jonathan Sacks]], warned that what he called a "tsunami of antisemitism" was spreading globally. In an interview with [[BBC Radio 4]], Sacks said: "A number of my rabbinical colleagues throughout Europe have been assaulted and attacked on the streets. We've had synagogues desecrated. We've had Jewish schools burnt to the ground – not here but in France. People are attempting to silence and even ban Jewish societies on campuses on the grounds that Jews must support the state of Israel, therefore they should be banned, which is quite extraordinary because ... British Jews see themselves as British citizens. So it's that kind of feeling that you don't know what's going to happen next that's making ... some European Jewish communities uncomfortable."&lt;ref name=Gillan&gt;Gillan, Audrey.

====The Netherlands====
{{See|History of the Jews in the Netherlands}}
Antisemitic incidents, from verbal abuse to violence, are reported, allegedly connected with Islamic youth, mostly boys of [[Morocco|Moroccan]] descent. According to the [[Centre for Information and Documentation on Israel]], a pro-Israel lobby group in the Netherlands, in 2009, the number of antisemitic incidents in [[Amsterdam]], the city that is home to most of the approximately 40,000 [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jews]], was said to be doubled compared to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrc.nl/international/article2468489.ece/Anti-Semitism_on_the_rise_in_Amsterdam "Anti-Semitism on the rise in Amsterdam"]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Raphaël Evers, an [[Orthodox judaism|orthodox]] rabbi in [[Amsterdam]], told the Norwegian newspaper [[aftenposten]] that Jews can no longer be safe in the city anymore due to the risk of violent assaults. "Jews no longer feel at home in the city. Many are considering [[aliyah]] to [[Israel]]."&lt;ref name="aftenposten.no"&gt;http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/uriks/article3584266.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
{{See|British Jews}}
In 2005, a group of British [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]] set up an inquiry into antisemitism, which published its findings in 2006. Its report stated that "until recently, the prevailing opinion both within the Jewish community and beyond [had been] that antisemitism had receded to the point that it existed only on the margins of society." It found a reversal of this progress since 2000. It aimed to investigate the problem, identify the sources of contemporary antisemitism and make recommendations to improve the situation. It discussed the influence of the Israel-Palestine conflict and issues of anti-Israel sentiment versus antisemitism at length and noted "most of those who gave evidence were at pains to explain that [[criticism of Israel]] is not to be regarded in itself as antisemitic ... The Israeli government itself may, at times, have mistakenly perceived criticism of its policies and actions to be motivated by antisemitism."&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.antisemitism.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/All-Party-Parliamentary-Inquiry-into-Antisemitism-REPORT.pdf Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism]|430&amp;nbsp;KB}}, All-Party Parliamentary Group against Antisemitism, September 2006, accessed 24 November 2010.

====France====
{{See|History of the Jews in France}}
France is home to the continent's largest Jewish community (about 600,000). Jewish leaders decry an intensifying antisemitism in France, mainly among Muslims of [[Arab]] or African heritage, but also growing among [[Caribbean]] islanders from former French colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/841445.html Jews for Le Pen] by Daniel Ben-Simon. Haaretz. 25/03/07&lt;/ref&gt;
Former Interior Minister [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] denounced the killing of [[Ilan Halimi]] on 13 February 2006 as an antisemitic crime.

Jewish philanthropist Baron [[Eric de Rothschild]] suggests that the extent of antisemitism in France has been exaggerated. In an interview with ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' he says that "the one thing you can't say is that France is an anti-Semitic country."&lt;ref&gt;Krieger, Leila Hilary.

====Norway====
{{Main|Antisemitism in Norway}}
In 2010, the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] after one year of research, revealed that antisemitism was common among some  8th, 9th, and 10th graders in Oslo's schools. Teachers at schools with large numbers of [[Muslim]]s revealed that Muslim students often "praise or admire [[Adolf Hitler]] for his killing of [[Jew]]s", that "Jew-hate is legitimate within vast groups of Muslim students" and that "Muslims laugh or command [teachers] to stop when trying to educate about the [[Holocaust]]". Additionally, "while some students might protest when some express support for [[terrorism]], none object when students express hate of Jews", saying that it says in "the [[Quran]] that you shall kill Jews, all true Muslims hate Jews". Most of these students were said to be born and raised in Norway. One [[Jew]]ish father also stated that his child had been taken by a Muslim mob after school (though the child managed to escape), reportedly "to be taken out to the forest and [[lynching|hung]] because he was a Jew".&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057|work=NRK Lørdagsrevyen|title=Jødiske blir hetset|date=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=http://theforeigner.no/pages/columns/what-about-norwegian-anti-semitism/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norwegian Education Minister Kristin Halvorsen referred to the antisemitism reported in this study as being “completely unacceptable.”  The head of a local Islamic council joined Jewish leaders and Halvorsen in denouncing such antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.newsinenglish.no/2010/03/16/anti-semitism-report-shocks-officials/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sweden====
{{Main|Antisemitism in Sweden}}
After Germany and Austria, Sweden has the highest rate of antisemitic incidents in Europe. Though the Netherlands reports a higher rate of antisemitism in some years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A government study in 2006 estimated that 15% of Swedes agree with the statement: "The Jews have too much influence in the world today".&lt;ref&gt;http://intolerans.levandehistoria.se/article/article_docs/antisemitism_english.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Five percent of the entire adult population, and 39% of the [[Muslims|Muslim]] population, harbor strong and consistent antisemitic views. Former Prime Minister [[Göran Persson]] described these results as "surprising and terrifying". However, the Rabbi of Stockholm's Orthodox Jewish community, Meir Horden claimed that "It's not true to say that the Swedes are anti-Semitic. Some of them are hostile to Israel because they support the weak side, which they perceive the [[Palestinians]] to be."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/922248.html Anti-Semitism, in Sweden? Depends who you're asking], Haaretz, November 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2010, the Swedish publication ''The Local'' published series of articles about the growing anti-Semitism in [[Malmö, Sweden]]. In an interview in January 2010, Fredrik Sieradzki of the Jewish Community of Malmö stated that "Threats against Jews have increased steadily in Malmö in recent years and many young Jewish families are choosing to leave the city. Many feel that the community and local politicians have shown a lack of understanding for how the city's Jewish residents have been marginalized." He also added that "right now many Jews in Malmö are really concerned about the situation here and don't believe they have a future here." The Local also reported that Jewish cemeteries and synagogues have repeatedly been defaced with anti-Semitic graffiti, and a chapel at another Jewish burial site in Malmö was firebombed in 2009.&lt;ref name="thelocal%2525252525252Ese"&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/24632/20100127/ Jews flee Malmö as anti-Semitism grows] by David Landes, The Local, January 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the Malmö police received reports of 79 anti-Semitic incidents, double the number of the previous year (2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/sweden/7278532/Jews-leave-Swedish-city-after-sharp-rise-in-anti-Semitic-hate-crimes.html Jews leave Swedish city after sharp rise in anti-Semitic hate crimes] Sunday Telegraph. 21 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Fredrik Sieradzki, spokesman for the Malmo Jewish community, estimated that the already small Jewish population is shrinking by 5% a year. "Malmo is a place to move away from," he said, citing anti-Semitism as the primary reason.&lt;ref name="forward.com"&gt;http://www.forward.com/articles/129233/&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, Fredrik Sieradzk told ''Die Presse'', an Austrian Internet publication, that Jews are being "harassed and physically attacked" by "people from the Middle East," although he added that only a small number of Malmo's 40,000 Muslims "exhibit hatred of Jews." Sieradzk also stated that approximately 30 Jewish families have emigrated from Malmo to Israel in the past year, specifically to escape from harassment. Also in March, the Swedish newspaper ''Skånska Dagbladet'' reported that attacks on Jews in Malmo totaled 79 in 2009, about twice as many as the previous year, according to police statistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/03/22/1011279/report-anti-semitic-attacks-in-rise-in-scandanavia Report: Anti-Semitic attacks rising in Scandinavia], Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), March 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, ''The Forward'' reported on the current state of Jews and the level of Anti-semitism in Sweden. Henrik Bachner, a writer and professor of history at the University of Lund, claimed that members of the Swedish Parliament have attended anti-Israel rallies where the Israeli flag was burned while the flags of Hamas and Hezbollah were waved, and the rhetoric was often anti-Semitic—not just anti-Israel. But such public rhetoric is not branded hateful and denounced. Charles Small, director of the [[Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Antisemitism]], stated that "Sweden is a microcosm of contemporary anti-Semitism. It's a form of acquiescence to radical Islam, which is diametrically opposed to everything Sweden stands for." Per Gudmundson, chief editorial writer for ''Svenska Dagbladet'', has sharply criticized politicians who offer "weak excuses" for Muslims accused of anti-Semitic crimes. "Politicians say these kids are poor and oppressed, and we have made them hate. They are, in effect, saying the behavior of these kids is in some way our fault."&lt;ref name=moveaway&gt;[http://www.forward.com/articles/129233/ For Jews, Swedish City Is a ‘Place To Move Away From’] by Donald Snyder, The Forward, Published July 07, 2010, issue of July 16, 2010.).&lt;/ref&gt; Judith Popinski, an 86-year-old Holocaust survivor, stated that she is no longer invited to schools that have a large Muslim presence to tell her story of surviving the Holocaust. Popinski, who found refuge in Malmo in 1945, stated that, until recently, she told her story in Malmo schools as part of their Holocaust studies program, but that now, many schools no longer ask Holocaust survivors to tell their stories, because Muslim students treat them with such disrespect, either ignoring the speakers or walking out of the class. She further stated that "Malmo reminds me of the anti-Semitism I felt as a child in Poland before the war. "I am not safe as a Jew in Sweden anymore."&lt;ref name="forward.com"/&gt;

In December 2010, the [[Jews|Jewish]] [[human rights]] organization [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] issued a travel advisory concerning Sweden, advising Jews to express "extreme caution" when visiting the southern parts of the country due to an increase in verbal and physical harassment of Jewish citizens in the city of [[Malmö]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=4441467&amp;ct=8971903&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East===
{{See|Arabs and antisemitism}}

[[Robert Bernstein]], founder of [[Human Rights Watch]], says that anti-Semitism is "deeply ingrained and institutionalized" in "Arab nations in modern times."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-do-human-rights-groups-ignore-palestinians-war-of-words/2011/09/26/gIQAWU5y2K_story.html Why do human rights groups ignore Palestinians’ war of words?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mudar Zahran, a Palestinian, writing for the [[Hudson Institute]] says that "the Palestinians have been used as fuel for the new form of anti-Semitism; this has hurt the Palestinians and exposed them to unprecedented and purposely media-ignored abuse by Arab governments, including some of those who claim love for the Palestinians, yet in fact only bear hatred to Jews. This has resulted in Palestinian cries for justice, equality, freedom and even basic human rights being ignored while the world getting consumed with delegitimizing Israel from either ignorance or malice."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudson-ny.org/1979/anti-semitism-20 Anti-semitism 2.0]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 survey by the [[Pew Research Center]], all of the Muslim-majority Middle Eastern countries polled held strongly negative views of Jews. In the questionnaire, only 2 percent of [[Egypt]]ians, 3 percent of [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] Muslims, and 2 percent of [[Jordan]]ians reported having a positive view of Jews. Muslim-majority countries outside the Middle East held similarly negative views, with 4 percent of [[Turkey|Turks]] and 9 percent of [[Indonesia]]ns viewing Jews favorably.&lt;ref&gt;Pew Research Center.

In the Middle East, anti-Zionist propaganda frequently adopts the terminology and symbols of the Holocaust to demonize Israel and its leaders.

The Center for Religious Freedom of [[Freedom House]] analyzed a set of Saudi Ministry of Education textbooks in Islamic studies courses for elementary and secondary school students. The researchers found statements promoting hate of  Christians, Jews, "polytheists" and other "unbelievers," including non-Wahhabi Muslims. [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]] was taught  as historical fact. The texts described Jews and Christians as enemies of Muslim believers and the clash between them as an ongoing fight that will end in victory over the Jews. Jews were blamed for virtually all the "subversion" and wars of the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=70&amp;release=379 freedomhouse.org: Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt; A {{PDFlink|[http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/CRF_SaudiReport_2006.pdf 38-page overview]|371&amp;nbsp;KB}} of Saudi Arabia's curriculum has been released to the press by the [[Hudson Institute]].

For this reason, Allah changed their shape and made them into monkeys and pigs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/egyptian_media/media_2002/stereotypes.asp Anti-Semitism in the Egyptian Media: February 2001 – February 2002], "Classic Anti-Semitic Stereotypes", [[Anti Defamation League]]. Retrieved March 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Israel, Zalman Gilichenski has warned about the spread of antisemitism among [[History of the Jews in Russia#Russia today|immigrants from Russia]] in the last decade.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://pogrom.org.il/eng_articles.php?cat_id=1 his website] and by example [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israels-nightmare-homegrown-neonazis-in-the-holy-land-396392.html Israel's nightmare: Homegrown neo-Nazis in the Holy Land], [[The Independent]], London, 2007-10-09&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades, synagogues have been targeted in a number of terrorist attacks. In 2003, the [[Neve Shalom Synagogue]] was targeted in a car bombing, killing 21 Turkish Muslims and 6 Jews.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3276549.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, the ''Economist'' suggested that "The best way for Turks to promote democracy would be to vote against the ruling party". Not long after, the Turkish Prime Minister, [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], said that "The international media, as they are supported by Israel, would not be happy with the continuation of the AKP government".&lt;ref name=cm&gt;[http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2011/06/07/turkey%E2%80%99s-prime-minister-the-jews-are-out-to-get-me/ Turkey's Prime Minister: The Jews Are Out to Get Me!], Commentary Magazine, 6 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Hurriyet Daily News'' went further by stating that "The Economist is part of an Israeli conspiracy that aims to topple the Turkish government".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=the-economist-faces-barrage-of-accusations-from-turkish-govt-2011-06-05 The Economist faces barrage of accusations from the Turkish gov't], The Hurriyet Daily News (English language edition), 12 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreover, during Erdogan's tenure, Hitler's ''Mein Kampf'' has once again become a best selling book in Turkey.&lt;ref name=cm/&gt; Prime Minister Erdogan called antisemitism  a "crime against humanity." He also said that "as a minority, they're our citizens. Both their security and the right to observe their faith are under our guarantee."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=131576 |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] | title=Erdogan vows to fight anti-Semitism in Turkey |date=March 2, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
