Primarily, antisemitic tendencies may be motivated by negative sentiment towards [[Jewish peoplehood|Jews as a people]] or by negative sentiment towards Jews with regard to [[Judaism]].

There are various ways in which antisemitism is manifested, ranging in the level of severity of [[Persecution of Jews|Jewish persecution]]. On the more subtle end, it consists of expressions of hatred or discrimination against individual Jews and may or may not be accompanied by violence. On the most extreme end, it consists of [[pogrom]]s or [[genocide]], which may or may not be state-sponsored. Although the term "antisemitism" did not come into common usage until the 19th century, it is also applied to previous and later anti-Jewish incidents. Notable instances of antisemitic persecution include the [[Rhineland massacres]] in 1096; the [[Edict of Expulsion]] in 1290; the [[persecution of Jews during the Black Death|European persecution of Jews during the Black Death]], between 1348 and 1351; the [[Massacre of 1391|massacre of Spanish Jews]] in 1391, the crackdown of the [[Spanish Inquisition]], and the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion of Jews from Spain]] in 1492; the [[Tach VeTat|Cossack massacres in Ukraine]], between 1648 and 1657; various [[Pogroms in the Russian Empire|anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire]], between 1821 and 1906; the [[Dreyfus affair]], between 1894 and 1906; [[the Holocaust]] by [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]]; and various [[antisemitism in the Soviet Union|Soviet anti-Jewish policies]]. Historically, most of the world's violent antisemitic events have taken place in [[Christianity in Europe|Christian Europe]]. However, since the early 20th century, there has been a sharp rise in [[Antisemitism in the Arab world|antisemitic incidents across the Arab world]], largely due to the surge in [[Conspiracy theories in the Arab world|Arab antisemitic conspiracy theories]], which have been cultivated to an extent under the aegis of [[Antisemitism in Europe|European antisemitic conspiracy theories]].&lt;ref name="Herf 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herf|first=Jeffrey|author-link=Jeffrey Herf|date=December 2009|title=Nazi Germany's Propaganda Aimed at Arabs and Muslims During World War II and the Holocaust: Old Themes, New Archival Findings|journal=[[Central European History]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|volume=42|issue=4|pages=709–736|doi=10.1017/S000893890999104X|jstor=40600977|s2cid=145568807|issn=0008-9389}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JCPA 2020"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spoerl|first=Joseph S.|date=January 2020|title=Parallels between Nazi and Islamist Anti-Semitism|url=https://jcpa.org/article/parallels-between-nazi-and-islamist-anti-semitism/|url-status=live|journal=Jewish Political Studies Review|publisher=[[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]]|volume=31|issue=1/2|pages=210–244|issn=0792-335X|jstor=26870795|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200609120031/https://jcpa.org/article/parallels-between-nazi-and-islamist-anti-semitism/|archive-date=9 June 2020|access-date=14 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent times, the idea that there is a variation of antisemitism known as "[[new antisemitism]]" has emerged on several occasions. According to this view, since [[Israel]] is a [[Jewish state]], expressions of [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist positions]] could harbour antisemitic sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=28 April 2016|title=What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36160928|access-date=20 February 2024|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Malik|first=Kenan|date=24 February 2019|title=Antisemites use the language of anti-Zionism.

Due to the root word ''[[Wikt:Semite|Semite]]'', the term is prone to being invoked as a misnomer by those who incorrectly assert (in an [[etymological fallacy]]) that it refers to racist hatred directed at "[[Semitic people]]" in spite of the fact that this grouping is an obsolete [[Historical race concepts|historical race concept]].

[[File:Statuten der Antisemiten-Liga.jpg|thumb|1879 statute of the Antisemitic League]]

The word "Semitic" was coined by German orientalist [[August Ludwig von Schlözer]] in 1781 to designate the [[Semitic languages|Semitic group of languages]]—[[Aramaic]], [[Arabic]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and others—allegedly spoken by the descendants of Biblical figure [[Shem|Sem]], son of [[Noah]].&lt;ref name="Vermeulen 2015 p. 252"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vermeulen|first=H.F.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B1nxCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT252|title=Before Boas: The Genesis of Ethnography and Ethnology in the German Enlightenment|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8032-7738-0|series=Critical Studies in the History of Anthropology Series|quote=Schlözer 1781: p.161 "From the Mediterranean to the Euphrates, from Mesopotamia to Arabia ruled one language, as is well known.

To the north and east of this Semitic language and national district (Semitische Sprach- und VölkerBezirke) begins a second one: With Moses and Leibniz I would like to call it the Japhetic."|access-date=7 October 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kiraz|2001|p=25}}; {{harvp|Baasten|2003|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of "antisemitic" terminologies is found in the responses of orientalist [[Moritz Steinschneider]] to the views of orientalist [[Ernest Renan]]. Historian [[Alex Bein]] writes: "The compound anti-Semitism appears to have been used first by Steinschneider, who challenged Renan on account of his 'anti-Semitic prejudices' [i.e., his derogation of the "[[Semitic people|Semites]]" as a [[Race (human categorization)|race]]]."{{sfnp|Bein|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cQOn0y8ENg4C&amp;pg=PA594 594]}} Psychologist [[Avner Falk]] similarly writes: "The German word ''{{Lang|de|antisemitisch}}'' was first used in 1860 by the Austrian Jewish scholar Moritz Steinschneider (1816–1907) in the phrase ''antisemitische Vorurteile'' (antisemitic prejudices). Steinschneider used this phrase to characterise the French philosopher Ernest Renan's false ideas about how '[[Semitic Race|Semitic races]]' were inferior to '[[Aryan race]]s{{'"}}.{{sfnp|Falk|2008|p=21}}

[[Pseudoscience|Pseudoscientific]] theories [[Scientific racism|concerning race]], civilization, and "progress" had become quite widespread in Europe in the second half of the 19th century, especially as [[Prussia]]n nationalistic historian [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] did much to promote this form of racism. He coined the phrase "the Jews are our misfortune" which would later be widely used by [[Nazism|Nazis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Poliakov|first=Léon|author-link=Léon Poliakov|title=The History of Anti-Semitism, Vol. 3: From Voltaire to Wagner|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2003|page=404|isbn=978-0-8122-1865-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Falk, Treitschke uses the term "Semitic" almost synonymously with "Jewish", in contrast to Renan's use of it to refer to a whole range of peoples,{{sfnp|Falk|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VWL4ja2BbnEC&amp;pg=PA21 21]}} based generally on linguistic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brustein|first=William I.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hc3HabBQsdsC&amp;pg=PA118|title=Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe before the Holocaust|location=Cambridge|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2003|page=118|access-date=27 October 2018|isbn=9780521774789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to philologist [[Jonathan M. Hess]], the term was originally used by its authors to "stress the radical difference between their own 'antisemitism' and earlier forms of antagonism toward Jews and Judaism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jonathan M.|last=Hess|title=Johann David Michaelis and the Colonial Imaginary: Orientalism and the Emergence of Racial Antisemitism in Eighteenth-Century Germany|journal=Jewish Social Studies|volume=6|number=2|date=Winter 2000|pages=56–101|doi=10.1353/jss.2000.0003|s2cid=153434303|quote=When the term "antisemitism" was first introduced in Germany in the late 1870s, those who used it did so in order to stress the radical difference between their own "antisemitism" and earlier forms of antagonism toward Jews and Judaism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bookcover-1880-Marr-German uber Juden.jpg|thumb|Cover page of Marr's ''The Way to Victory of Germanicism over Judaism'', 1880 edition]]

In 1879, German journalist [[Wilhelm Marr]] published a pamphlet, {{Lang|de|Der Sieg des Judenthums über das Germanenthum. Vom nicht confessionellen Standpunkt aus betrachtet}} (''The Victory of the Jewish Spirit over the Germanic Spirit. Observed from a non-religious perspective'') in which he used the word ''Semitismus'' interchangeably with the word ''Judentum'' to denote both "Jewry" (the Jews as a collective) and "Jewishness" (the quality of being Jewish, or the Jewish spirit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaspal|first=Rusi|year=2014|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qS_jBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT38|title=Antisemitism and Anti-Zionism: Representation, Cognition and Everyday Talk|location=Farnham, Surrey|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|chapter=Antisemitism: Conceptual Issues|isbn=9781472407252|access-date=27 October 2018|archive-date=29 December 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231229235525/https://books.google.com/books?id=qS_jBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|url-status=live}} Jaspal erroneously gives the date of publication as 1873.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Marr|Marr, Wilhelm]].

Marr uses the word "Semitismus" (Semitism) on pages 7, 11, 14, 30, 32, and 46; for example, one finds in the conclusion the following passage: "Ja, ich bin überzeugt, ich habe ausgesprochen, was Millionen Juden im Stillen denken: Dem Semitismus gehört die Weltherrschaft!"

This followed his 1862 book ''Die Judenspiegel'' (''A Mirror to the Jews'') in which he argued that "Judaism must cease to exist if humanity is to commence", demanding both that Judaism be dissolved as a "religious-denominational sect" but also subject to criticism "as a race, a civil and social entity".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Wilhelm Marr's A Mirror to the Jews|url=https://keydocuments.net/article/bergmann-marr-mirror-jews|access-date=29 July 2024|website=Key Documents of German-Jewish History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Levy|first=Richard S.|author-link=Richard S.

The pamphlet became very popular, and in the same year Marr founded the ''Antisemiten-Liga'' (League of Antisemites),&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Wilhelm Marr: The Patriarch of Antisemitism|last=Zimmermann|first=Moshe|author-link=Moshe Zimmermann|publisher=New York and Oxford: Oxford University|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; apparently named to follow the "Anti-Kanzler-Liga" (Anti-Chancellor League).&lt;ref name="MZ1987"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zimmermann|first=Moshe|author-link=Moshe Zimmermann|title=Wilhelm Marr: The Patriarch of Anti-Semitism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tYW013SjKM4C&amp;pg=PA112|year=1987|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-536495-8|page=112|access-date=27 October 2018|quote=The term "anti-Semitism" was unsuitable from the beginning for the real essence of Jew-hatred, which remained anchored, more or less, in the Christian tradition even when it moved via the natural sciences, into racism.

The founders of the new Organization adopted the elements of "anti" and "league," and searched for the proper term: Marr exchanged the term "Jew" for "Semite" which he already favored. It is possible that the shortened form "Sem" is used with such frequency and ease by Marr (and in his writings) due to its literary advantage and because it reminded Marr of Sem Biedermann, his Jewish employer from the Vienna period.|archive-date=29 December 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231229235552/https://books.google.com/books?id=tYW013SjKM4C&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league was the first German organization committed specifically to combating the alleged threat to Germany and German culture posed by the Jews and their influence and advocating their [[population transfer|forced removal]] from the country.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

So far as can be ascertained, the word was first widely printed in 1881, when Marr published ''Zwanglose Antisemitische Hefte'', and [[Wilhelm Scherer]] used the term ''Antisemiten'' in the January issue of ''[[Neue Freie Presse]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

The ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' reports, "In February 1881, a correspondent of the ''[[Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums]]'' speaks of 'Anti-Semitism' as a designation which recently came into use ("Allg.

The word "antisemitism" was borrowed into English from German in 1881. ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' editor [[James Murray (lexicographer)|James Murray]] wrote that it was not included in the first edition because "Anti-Semite and its family were then probably very new in English use, and not thought likely to be more than passing nonce-words...

===Usage===
From the outset the term "anti-Semitism" bore special racial connotations and meant specifically prejudice against [[Jews]].&lt;ref name="MWdef" /&gt;{{sfnp|Lipstadt|2019|pp=22–25}}&lt;ref name="JustJews" /&gt; The term has been described as confusing, for in modern usage 'Semitic' designates a language group, not a race. In this sense, the term is a misnomer, since there are many speakers of [[Semitic languages]] (e.g., [[Arabs]], [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethiopians]], and [[Arameans]]) who are not the objects of antisemitic prejudices, while there are many Jews who do not speak [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], a Semitic language. Though 'antisemitism' could be construed as [[prejudice]] against people who speak other Semitic languages, this is not how the term is commonly used.{{sfnp|Lewis|1999|p=117}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Benjamin|last=Isaac|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eem1AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA442|title=The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=2004|page=442|access-date=27 October 2018|isbn=9781400849567|archive-date=29 December 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231229235521/https://books.google.com/books?id=eem1AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA442#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-link=David Matas|last=Matas|first=David|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYR7SqcMe9gC&amp;pg=PA34|title=Aftershock: Anti-Zionism and Antisemitism|publisher=Dundurn Press|year=2005|page=34|access-date=27 October 2018|isbn=9781550025538|archive-date=29 December 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231229235524/https://books.google.com/books?id=DYR7SqcMe9gC&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/sites/default/files/memo-on-spelling-of-antisemitism_final-1.pdf|title=Memo on Spelling of Antisemitism|publisher=[[International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance]]|date=April 2015|quote=... the hyphenated spelling allows for the possibility of something called 'Semitism', which not only legitimizes a form of pseudo-scientific racial classification that was thoroughly discredited by association with Nazi ideology, but also divides the term, stripping it from its meaning of opposition and hatred toward Jews.|access-date=24 May 2019|archive-date=31 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031085825/https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/sites/default/files/memo-on-spelling-of-antisemitism_final-1.pdf|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition===
Though the general definition of antisemitism is hostility or prejudice against Jews, and, according to [[Olaf Blaschke]], has become an "umbrella term for negative stereotypes about Jews",&lt;ref name="pogromsriots"&gt;{{cite book|first=Sonja|last=Weinberg|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0HDeEPouQm0C&amp;pg=PA18|title=Pogroms and Riots: German Press Responses to Anti-Jewish Violence in Germany and Russia (1881–1882)|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2010|access-date=27 October 2018|isbn=9783631602140|archive-date=29 December 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231229235557/https://books.google.com/books?id=0HDeEPouQm0C&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}} a number of authorities have developed more formal definitions.

Writing in 1987, Holocaust scholar and [[City University of New York]] professor [[Helen Fein]] defined it as "a persisting latent structure of hostile beliefs towards Jews as a collective manifested in individuals as attitudes, and in culture as myth, ideology, folklore and imagery, and in actions—social or legal discrimination, political mobilization against the Jews, and collective or state violence—which results in and/or is designed to distance, displace, or destroy Jews as Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor-last=Fine|editor-first=Helen|title=The persisting question: sociological perspectives and social contexts of modern antisemitism|date=1987|page=67|publisher=de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-010170-6|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elaborating on Fein's definition, Dietz Bering of the [[University of Cologne]] writes that, to antisemites, "Jews are not only partially but totally bad by nature, that is, their bad traits are incorrigible. Because of this bad nature: (1) Jews have to be seen not as individuals but as a collective. (2) Jews remain essentially alien in the surrounding societies. (3) Jews bring disaster on their 'host societies' or on the whole world, they are doing it secretly, therefore the anti-Semites feel obliged to unmask the conspiratorial, bad Jewish character."{{sfnp|Falk|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zL_0WOiZj0oC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}}

For Swiss historian [[Sonja Weinberg]], as distinct from economic and religious [[anti-Judaism]], antisemitism in its specifically modern form shows conceptual innovation, a resort to "science" to defend itself, new functional forms, and organisational differences. It was anti-liberal, racialist and nationalist. It promoted the myth that [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Jews conspired to 'judaise' the world]]; it served to consolidate social identity; it channeled dissatisfactions among victims of the capitalist system; and it was used as a conservative cultural code to fight emancipation and liberalism.&lt;ref name="pogromsriots" /&gt;{{rp|18–19}}

[[Bernard Lewis]], writing in 2006, defined antisemitism as a special case of prejudice, hatred, or persecution directed against people who are in some way different from the rest. According to Lewis, antisemitism is marked by two distinct features: Jews are judged according to a standard different from that applied to others, and they are accused of "cosmic evil". Thus, "it is perfectly possible to hate and even to persecute Jews without necessarily being anti-Semitic" unless this hatred or persecution displays one of the two features specific to antisemitism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]]. [http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/21832.html "The New Anti-Semitism"], ''The American Scholar'', Volume 75 No. 1, Winter 2006, pp. 25–36, {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908010822/http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/21832.html|date=8 September 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of efforts by international and governmental bodies to define antisemitism formally. In 2005, the [[United States Department of State]] stated that "while there is no universally accepted definition, there is a generally clear understanding of what the term encompasses." For the purposes of its 2005 Report on Global Anti-Semitism, the term was considered to mean "hatred toward Jews—individually and as a group—that can be attributed to the Jewish religion and/or ethnicity."&lt;ref name=USDS&gt;[https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/40258.htm "Report on Global Anti-Semitism"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210125182906/https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/40258.htm |date=25 January 2021 }}, [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], 5 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and [[Xenophobia]] (EUMC, now the [[Fundamental Rights Agency]]), an agency of the [[European Union]], developed a more detailed [[EUMC Working Definition of Antisemitism|working definition]], which stated: "Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities." It also adds that "such manifestations could also target the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity," but that "criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic."&lt;ref name="antisemitic"/&gt; It provided contemporary examples of ways in which antisemitism may manifest itself, including promoting the harming of Jews in the name of an ideology or religion; promoting negative stereotypes of Jews; holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of an individual Jewish person or group; [[Holocaust denial|denying the Holocaust]] or accusing Jews or Israel of exaggerating it; and accusing Jews of [[dual loyalty]] or a greater allegiance to Israel than their own country. It also lists ways in which attacking Israel could be antisemitic, and states that denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor, can be a manifestation of antisemitism—as can applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation, or holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the State of Israel.&lt;ref name="antisemitic"&gt;

===Evolution of usage===
In 1879, [[Wilhelm Marr]] founded the ''Antisemiten-Liga'' (Anti-Semitic League).&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Levy, "Marr, Wilhelm (1819–1904)" in {{harvp|Levy|2005|loc=vol. 2, pp. 445–446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identification with antisemitism and as an antisemite was politically advantageous in Europe during the late 19th century. For example, [[Karl Lueger]], the popular mayor of [[fin de siècle]] [[Vienna]], skillfully exploited antisemitism as a way of channeling public discontent to his political advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Geehr. ''Karl Lueger, Mayor of Fin-de-Siècle Vienna'', [[Wayne State University Press]], Detroit, 1989. {{ISBN|0-8143-2055-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 1910 obituary of Lueger, ''The New York Times'' notes that Lueger was "Chairman of the Christian Social Union of the Parliament and of the Anti-Semitic Union of the Diet of Lower Austria.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1910/03/11/archives/dr-karl-lueger-dead-antisemitic-leader-and-mayor-of-vienna-was-66.html Dr. Karl Lueger Dead; Anti-Semitic Leader and Mayor of Vienna Was 66 Years Old]", ''The New York Times'', 11 March 1910. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210126110903/https://www.nytimes.com/1910/03/11/archives/dr-karl-lueger-dead-antisemitic-leader-and-mayor-of-vienna-was-66.html |date=26 January 2021 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, [[A. C. Cuza]] organized the ''Alliance Anti-semitique Universelle'' in Bucharest. In the period before [[World War II]], when animosity towards Jews was far more commonplace, it was not uncommon for a person, an organization, or a political party to self-identify as an antisemite or antisemitic.

The early [[Zionism|Zionist]] pioneer [[Leon Pinsker]], a professional physician, preferred the clinical-sounding term ''Judeophobia'' to antisemitism, which he regarded as a misnomer. The word ''Judeophobia'' first appeared in his pamphlet "[[Auto-Emancipation]]", published anonymously in German in September 1882, where it was described as an irrational fear or hatred of Jews. According to Pinsker, this irrational fear was an inherited predisposition.&lt;ref name="Bartlett2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Steven J.|title=The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U5KQ0Yi76GMC&amp;pg=PA30|year=2005|publisher=Charles C Thomas Publisher|isbn=9780398075576|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{blockquote|Judeophobia is a form of demonopathy, with the distinction that the Jewish ghost has become known to the whole race of mankind, not merely to certain races...

Thus have Judaism and Jew-hatred passed through history for centuries as inseparable companions...

In the aftermath of the [[Kristallnacht]] pogrom in 1938, German propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] announced: "The German people is anti-Semitic. It has no desire to have its rights restricted or to be provoked in the future by parasites of the Jewish race."&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Telegraph'', 12 November 1938.

After 1945 [[End of World War II in Europe|victory of the Allies over Nazi Germany]], and particularly after the full extent of the [[The Holocaust|Nazi genocide against the Jews]] became known, the term ''antisemitism'' acquired [[pejorative]] connotations. This marked a full circle shift in usage, from an era just decades earlier when "Jew" was used as a pejorative term.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Rader Marcus. ''United States Jewry, 1776–1985.''

===Eternalism–contextualism debate===
The study of antisemitism has become politically controversial because of differing interpretations of the Holocaust and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.{{sfnp|Judaken|2018|pp=1123–1124}} There are two competing views of antisemitism, eternalism, and contextualism.{{sfnp|Consonni|2022|p=25}} The eternalist view sees antisemitism as separate from other forms of racism and prejudice and an exceptionalist, transhistorical force [[teleological]]ly culminating in the Holocaust.{{sfnp|Consonni|2022|p=25}}{{sfnp|Judaken|2018|pp=1123, 1130}} Hannah Arendt criticized this approach, writing that it provoked "the uncomfortable question: 'Why the Jews of all people?' ... with the question begging reply: Eternal hostility."{{sfnp|Judaken|2018|p=1130}} Zionist thinkers and antisemites draw different conclusions from what they perceive as the eternal hatred of Jews; according to antisemites, it proves the inferiority of Jews, while for Zionists it means that Jews need their own state as a refuge.{{sfnp|Judaken|2018|p=1135}}{{sfnp|Ury|2018|p=1151}} Most Zionists do not believe that antisemitism can be combatted with education or other means.{{sfnp|Judaken|2018|p=1135}}

The contextual approach treats antisemitism as a type of racism and focuses on the historical context in which hatred of Jews emerges.{{sfnp|Consonni|2022|p=27}} Some contextualists restrict the use of "antisemitism" to refer exclusively to the era of modern racism, treating anti-Judaism as a separate phenomenon.{{sfnp|Judaken|2018|p=1132}} Historian [[David Engel (historian)|David Engel]] has challenged the project to define antisemitism, arguing that it essentializes Jewish history as one of persecution and discrimination.{{sfnp|Consonni|2022|p=26}} Engel argues that the term "antisemitism" is not useful in historical analysis because it implies that there are links between anti-Jewish prejudices expressed in different contexts, without evidence of such a connection.{{sfnp|Judaken|2018|p=1130}}

==Manifestations==
[[File:Medieval manuscript-Jews identified by rouelle are being burned at stake.jpg|thumb|Jews (identified by the mandatory [[Jewish badge]] and [[Jewish hat]]) being burned.]]

Antisemitism manifests itself in a variety of ways. [[René König]] mentions social antisemitism, economic antisemitism, religious antisemitism, and political antisemitism as examples. König points out that these different forms demonstrate that the "origins of anti-Semitic prejudices are rooted in different historical periods." König asserts that differences in the chronology of different antisemitic prejudices and the irregular distribution of such prejudices over different segments of the population create "serious difficulties in the definition of the different kinds of anti-Semitism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Materialien zur Kriminalsoziologie|first=René|last=König|publisher=VS Verlag|year=2004|page=231|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9oL2cljv8QC&amp;pg=PA231|isbn=978-3-8100-3306-2|access-date=23 August 2020|archive-date=30 December 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231230000128/https://books.google.com/books?id=N9oL2cljv8QC&amp;pg=PA231|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These difficulties may contribute to the existence of different taxonomies that have been developed to categorize the forms of antisemitism. The forms identified are substantially the same; it is primarily the number of forms and their definitions that differ. [[Bernard Lazare]], writing in the 1890s, identified three forms of antisemitism: [[Christianity and antisemitism|Christian antisemitism]], economic antisemitism, and ethnologic antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anti-Semitism: Its History and Causes|first=Bernard|last=Lazare|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|year=2006|page=224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VP81v2Y24HUC&amp;pg=PA224|isbn=978-1-59605-601-5|access-date=23 August 2020|archive-date=30 December 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231230000042/https://books.google.com/books?id=VP81v2Y24HUC&amp;pg=PA224#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William I.

[[Religious antisemitism]], also known as anti-Judaism, is antipathy towards Jews because of their perceived religious beliefs. In theory, antisemitism and attacks against individual Jews would stop if Jews stopped practicing Judaism or changed their public faith, especially by [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to the official or right religion. However, in some cases, discrimination continues after conversion, as in the case of ''[[Marranos]]'' (Christianized Jews in Spain and Portugal) in the late 15th century and 16th century, who were suspected of secretly practising Judaism or Jewish customs.{{sfnp|Flannery|1985|p={{page needed|date=July 2022}}}}

Although the origins of antisemitism are rooted in the Judeo-Christian conflict, other forms of antisemitism have developed in modern times. Frederick Schweitzer asserts that "most scholars ignore the Christian foundation on which the modern antisemitic edifice rests and invoke political antisemitism, cultural antisemitism, racism or racial antisemitism, economic antisemitism, and the like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A concise history of American antisemitism|first=Robert|last=Michael|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2005|page=vii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5G3feplFBYUC&amp;pg=PR7|isbn=978-0-7425-4313-3|access-date=23 August 2020|archive-date=30 December 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231230001047/https://books.google.com/books?id=5G3feplFBYUC&amp;pg=PR7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Nicholls draws a distinction between religious antisemitism and modern antisemitism based on racial or ethnic grounds: "The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion [...] a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon [[baptism]]." From the perspective of racial antisemitism, however, "the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism.[...] From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews[...] Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicholls|first=William|author-link=|date=1993|title=Christian Antisemitism: A History of Hate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cg00E0gk9PQC|location=[[Lanham, Maryland]]|publisher=[[Jason Aronson]] / [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|page=314|isbn=0-87668-398-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christians such as the Catholic priest [[Ernest Jouin]], who published the first French translation of the ''Protocols'', combined religious and racial antisemitism, as in his statement that "From the triple viewpoint of race, of nationality, and of religion, the Jew has become the enemy of humanity."{{sfnp|Michael|2008|p=171}} The virulent antisemitism of [[Édouard Drumont]], one of the most widely read Catholic writers in France during the Dreyfus Affair, likewise combined religious and racial antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnal|first1=Oscar L.|title=Ambivalent Alliance: The Catholic Church and the Action Française, 1899–1939|date=1985|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rubenstein|first1=Richard L.|title=Approaches to Auschwitz: The Holocaust and Its Legacy|date=2003|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brustein|first1=William|title=Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe Before the Holocaust|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drumont founded the [[Antisemitic League of France]].

The underlying premise of economic antisemitism is that Jews perform harmful economic activities or that economic activities become harmful when they are performed by Jews.&lt;ref name=MeyerBrenner220&gt;{{cite book|title=German-Jewish History in Modern Times: Integration in dispute, 1871–1918|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1998|page=220|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HFFoSglsovoC&amp;pg=PA220|isbn=978-0-231-07476-6|access-date=23 August 2020|archive-date=30 December 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231230001150/https://books.google.com/books?id=HFFoSglsovoC&amp;pg=PA220#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linking Jews and money underpins the most damaging and lasting [[antisemitic canard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jews &amp; Money – The story of a stereotype|url=http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/jewsandmoney/default.asp|access-date=18 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228220753/http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/jewsandmoney/default.asp|archive-date=28 February 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemites claim that Jews control the world finances, a theory promoted in the fraudulent ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' and later repeated by [[Henry Ford]] and his ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]''. In the modern era, such myths continue to be spread in books such as ''[[The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews]]'' published by the [[Nation of Islam]] and on the internet.

[[Derek Penslar]] writes that there are two components to the financial canards:&lt;ref&gt;Penslar page 5 {{Incomplete short citation|date=July 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:a) Jews are savages that "are temperamentally incapable of performing honest labor"
:b) Jews are "leaders of a financial cabal seeking world domination"

[[Abraham Foxman]] describes six facets of the financial canards:
#All Jews are wealthy{{sfnp|Foxman|2010|p=84}}
#Jews are stingy and greedy{{sfnp|Foxman|2010|p=89}}
#Powerful Jews control the business world{{sfnp|Foxman|2010|p=93}}
#Jewish religion emphasizes profit and materialism{{sfnp|Foxman|2010|p=98}}
#It is okay for Jews to cheat non-Jews{{sfnp|Foxman|2010|p=102}}
#Jews use their power to benefit "their own kind"{{sfnp|Foxman|2010|p=105}}

[[Gerald Krefetz]] summarizes the myth as "[Jews] control the banks, the money supply, the economy, and businesses—of the community, of the country, of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz page 45 {{Incomplete short citation|date=July 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krefetz gives, as illustrations, many slurs and proverbs (in several different languages) which suggest that Jews are stingy, or greedy, or miserly, or aggressive bargainers.&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz pages 6–7 {{Incomplete short citation|date=July 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the nineteenth century, Jews were described as "scurrilous, stupid, and tight-fisted", but after the [[Jewish Emancipation]] and the rise of Jews to the middle- or upper-class in Europe were portrayed as "clever, devious, and manipulative financiers out to dominate [world finances]".&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz page 47 {{Incomplete short citation|date=July 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Léon Poliakov]] asserts that economic antisemitism is not a distinct form of antisemitism, but merely a manifestation of theologic antisemitism (because, without the theological causes of economic antisemitism, there would be no economic antisemitism). In opposition to this view, Derek Penslar contends that in the modern era, economic antisemitism is "distinct and nearly constant" but theological antisemitism is "often subdued".&lt;ref&gt;Penslar page 12 {{Incomplete short citation|date=July 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An academic study by Francesco D'Acunto, Marcel Prokopczuk, and Michael Weber showed that people who live in areas of Germany that contain the most brutal history of antisemitic persecution are more likely to be distrustful of finance in general. Therefore, they tended to invest less money in the stock market and make poor financial decisions. The study concluded, "that the persecution of minorities reduces not only the long-term wealth of the persecuted but of the persecutors as well."&lt;ref&gt;D'Acunto, Francesco, et al.

Racial antisemitism is prejudice against [[Jew]]s as a racial/ethnic group, rather than [[Judaism]] as a religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1603&amp;letter=A&amp;search=Anti-semitism "Anti-Semitism"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921041255/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1603&amp;letter=A&amp;search=anti-semitism |date=21 September 2011 }}, [[Jewish Encyclopedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial antisemitism is the idea that the Jews are a distinct and inferior race compared to their host nations. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, it gained mainstream acceptance as part of the [[eugenics]] movement, which categorized non-Europeans as inferior. It more specifically claimed that Northern Europeans, or "Aryans", were superior. Racial antisemites saw the Jews as part of a Semitic race and emphasized their non-European origins and culture. They saw Jews as beyond redemption even if they converted to the majority religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jesus – The Jewish religion in the 1st century|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jesus/The-Jewish-religion-in-the-1st-century|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=31 August 2022|archive-date=11 December 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201211142824/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jesus/The-Jewish-religion-in-the-1st-century|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial antisemitism replaced the hatred of Judaism with the hatred of Jews as a group. In the context of the [[Industrial Revolution]], following the [[Jewish Emancipation]], Jews rapidly urbanized and experienced a period of greater social mobility. With the decreasing role of religion in public life tempering religious antisemitism, a combination of growing [[nationalism]], the rise of eugenics, and resentment at the socio-economic success of the Jews led to the newer, and more virulent, racist antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007171|title=Antisemitism in History: Racial Antisemitism, 1875–1945|website=ushmm.org|access-date=15 September 2017|archive-date=23 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823210503/https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007171|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, a number of laws enabling the emancipation of the Jews were enacted in Western European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Webster (2001) ''Petain's Crime''.

Continuum: pp. 44–46.{{full citation needed|date=July 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old laws restricting them to [[ghetto]]s, as well as the many laws that limited their property rights, rights of worship and occupation, were rescinded. Despite this, traditional discrimination and hostility to Jews on religious grounds persisted and was supplemented by [[racial antisemitism]], encouraged by the work of racial theorists such as [[Joseph Arthur de Gobineau]] and particularly his ''Essay on the Inequality of the Human Race'' of 1853–1855. [[Nationalist]] agendas based on [[ethnicity]], known as [[ethnonationalism]], usually excluded the Jews from the national community as an alien race.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Beller (2007) ''Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction'': p. 64.{{full citation needed|date=July 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allied to this were theories of [[Social Darwinism]], which stressed a putative conflict between higher and lower races of human beings. Such theories, usually posited by northern Europeans, advocated the superiority of white [[Aryan]]s to [[Semitic people|Semitic]] Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Beller (2007) ''Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction'': pp. 57–59.{{full citation needed|date=July 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political antisemitism===
{{Quote box
|quote=The whole problem of the Jews exists only in nation states, for here their energy and higher intelligence, their accumulated capital of spirit and will, gathered from generation to generation through a long schooling in suffering, must become so preponderant as to arouse mass envy and hatred. In almost all contemporary nations, therefore – in direct proportion to the degree to which they act up nationalistically – the literary obscenity of leading the Jews to slaughter as scapegoats of every conceivable public and internal misfortune is spreading.

[[William I. Brustein|William Brustein]] defines political antisemitism as hostility toward Jews based on the belief that Jews seek national or world power. Yisrael Gutman characterizes political antisemitism as tending to "lay responsibility on the Jews for defeats and political economic crises" while seeking to "exploit opposition and resistance to Jewish influence as elements in political party platforms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Genocide, critical issues of the Holocaust: a companion to the film, Genocide|publisher=Behrman House, Inc|year=1983|page=100|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DcdiVs9lwvcC&amp;pg=PA100|isbn=978-0-940646-04-9|access-date=23 August 2020|archive-date=30 December 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231230001125/https://books.google.com/books?id=DcdiVs9lwvcC&amp;pg=PA100|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Derek J.

''Contemporary Antisemitism: Canada and the World'', edited by Penslar, et al, University of Toronto Press, 2005, pp. 3–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Viktor Karády, political antisemitism became widespread after the legal emancipation of the Jews and sought to reverse some of the consequences of that emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Jews of Europe in the modern era: a socio-historical outline|first=Viktor|last=Karády|publisher=[[Central European University Press]]|year=2004|page=348|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4hGg9rMQpEEC&amp;pg=PA351|isbn=978-963-9241-52-7|access-date=23 August 2020|archive-date=30 December 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231230001153/https://books.google.com/books?id=4hGg9rMQpEEC&amp;pg=PA351#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural antisemitism===
Louis Harap defines cultural antisemitism as "that species of anti-Semitism that charges the Jews with corrupting a given culture and attempting to supplant or succeeding in supplanting the preferred culture with a uniform, crude, "Jewish" culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Creative awakening: the Jewish presence in twentieth-century American literature|first=Louis|last=Harap|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1987|page=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mAPvam-n_DYC&amp;pg=PA76|isbn=978-0-313-25386-7|access-date=23 August 2020|archive-date=30 December 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231230000109/https://books.google.com/books?id=mAPvam-n_DYC&amp;pg=PA76|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Eric Kandel]] characterizes cultural antisemitism as being based on the idea of "Jewishness" as a "religious or cultural tradition that is acquired through learning, through distinctive traditions and education." According to Kandel, this form of antisemitism views Jews as possessing "unattractive psychological and social characteristics that are acquired through acculturation."&lt;ref name=Kandel30&gt;{{cite book|title=In search of memory: the emergence of a new science of mind|first=Eric R.|last=Kandel|publisher=W.

==History==
{{Main|History of antisemitism}}
{{For timeline}}
{{Jews and Judaism sidebar |History}}

Many authors see the roots of modern antisemitism in both pagan antiquity and early Christianity. Jerome Chanes identifies six stages in the historical development of antisemitism:{{sfnp|Chanes|2004}}
#Pre-Christian anti-Judaism in ancient Greece and Rome which was primarily ethnic in nature
#Christian antisemitism in antiquity and the Middle Ages which was religious in nature and has extended into modern times
#Traditional Muslim antisemitism which was—at least, in its classical form—nuanced in that Jews were a protected class
#Political, social and economic antisemitism of Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment Europe which laid the groundwork for racial antisemitism
#Racial antisemitism that arose in the 19th century and culminated in Nazism in the 20th century
#Contemporary antisemitism which has been labeled by some as the [[New Antisemitism]]

Chanes suggests that these six stages could be merged into three categories: "ancient antisemitism, which was primarily ethnic in nature; [[Christian antisemitism]], which was religious; and the racial antisemitism of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."{{sfnp|Chanes|2004|pp=5–6}}

===Ancient world===
The first clear examples of anti-Jewish sentiment can be traced to the 3rd century BCE to [[Alexandria]],{{sfnp|Flannery|1985|p=11}} the home to the largest Jewish diaspora community in the world at the time and where the [[Septuagint]], a Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]], was produced.

There are examples of [[Hellenistic]] rulers desecrating the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] and banning Jewish religious practices, such as [[circumcision]], Shabbat observance, the study of Jewish religious books, etc. Examples may also be found in anti-Jewish riots in Alexandria in the 3rd century BCE.

In [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Europe, Jews were persecuted with [[blood libel]]s, expulsions, [[forced conversion]]s and [[massacre]]s. These persecutions were often justified on religious grounds and reached a first peak during the [[Crusades]]. In 1096, hundreds or thousands of [[Rhineland massacres|Jews were killed]] during the [[First Crusade]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Chazan]], ''In the Year 1096: The First Crusade and the Jews'' (1996) [https://www.questia.com/library/5684490/in-the-year-1096-the-first-crusade-and-the-jews online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200726053850/https://www.questia.com/library/5684490/in-the-year-1096-the-first-crusade-and-the-jews |date=26 July 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first major outbreak of anti-Jewish violence in Christian Europe outside Spain and was cited by Zionists in the 19th century as indicating the need for a state of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Corliss K.

In 1147, there were several massacres of Jews during the [[Second Crusade]]. The [[Shepherds' Crusade (1251)|Shepherds' Crusades of 1251]] and [[Shepherds' Crusade (1320)|1320]] both involved attacks, as did the [[Rintfleisch massacres]] in 1298. Expulsions followed, such as the 1290 banishment of Jews from [[England]], the expulsion of 100,000 Jews from France in 1394,&lt;ref&gt;History of the reign of Charles VI, titled ''[[Chronique de Religieux de Saint-Denys]]'', encompasses the king's full reign in six volumes. Originally written in Latin, the work was translated to French in six volumes by L. Bellaguet between 1839 and 1852.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1421 expulsion of thousands of Jews from Austria.

In medieval and Renaissance Europe, a major contributor to the deepening of antisemitic sentiment and legal action among the Christian populations was the popular preaching of the zealous reform religious orders, the Franciscans (especially [[Bernardino of Feltre]]) and Dominicans (especially [[Vincent Ferrer]]), who combed Europe and promoted antisemitism through their often fiery, emotional appeals.&lt;ref&gt;Franco Mormando, ''The Preacher's Demons: Bernardino of Siena and the Social Underworld of Early Renaissance Italy'', Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1999, Ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Black Death]] epidemics devastated Europe in the mid-14th century, causing the death of a large part of the population, Jews were used as [[scapegoating#Psychology and sociology|scapegoats]]. Rumors spread that they caused the disease by deliberately poisoning wells. Hundreds of Jewish communities were [[Black Death Jewish persecutions|destroyed in numerous persecutions]]. Although [[Pope Clement VI]] tried to protect them by issuing two [[papal bull]]s in 1348, the first on 6 July and an additional one several months later, 900 Jews were [[Strasbourg massacre|burned alive in Strasbourg]], where the plague had not yet affected the city.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;See Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, ''La plus grande épidémie de l'histoire'' ("The greatest epidemics in history"), in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' magazine, n°310, June 2006, p. 47 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformation===
{{Main|Martin Luther and antisemitism}}

[[Martin Luther]], an [[ecclesiastical]] reformer whose teachings inspired the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], wrote antagonistically about Jews in his pamphlet ''[[On the Jews and Their Lies (Martin Luther)|On the Jews and their Lies]]'', written in 1543. He portrays the Jews in extremely harsh terms, excoriates them and provides detailed recommendations for a [[pogrom]] against them, calling for their permanent oppression and expulsion. At one point he writes: "...we are at fault in not slaying them...", a passage that, according to historian [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], "may be termed the first work of modern antisemitism, and a giant step forward on the road to [[the Holocaust]]."&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Johnson, Paul]] (1987) ''A History of the Jews''.

During the mid-to-late 17th century the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was devastated by several conflicts, in which the Commonwealth lost over a third of its population (over 3&amp;nbsp;million people), and Jewish losses were counted in the hundreds of thousands. The first of these conflicts was the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], when [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]'s supporters massacred tens of thousands of [[History of Jews in Poland|Jews]] in the eastern and southern areas he controlled (today's [[Ukraine]]). The precise number of dead may never be known, but the decrease of the Jewish population during that period is estimated at 100,000 to 200,000, which also includes emigration, deaths from diseases, and [[Slavery (Ottoman Empire)|captivity in the Ottoman Empire]], called ''jasyr''.&lt;ref&gt;"Bogdan Chmelnitzki leads Cossack uprising against Polish rule; 100,000 Jews are killed and hundreds of Jewish communities are destroyed."

European immigrants to the United States brought antisemitism to the country as early as the 17th century. [[Peter Stuyvesant]], the Dutch governor of [[New Amsterdam]], implemented plans to prevent Jews from settling in the city. During the Colonial Era, the American government limited the political and economic rights of Jews. It was not until the [[American Revolutionary War]] that Jews gained legal rights, including the right to vote. However, even at their peak, the restrictions on Jews in the United States were never as stringent as they had been in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Boyer|editor-first=Paul S.|title=The Oxford companion to United States history|year=2006|publisher=Oxford Univ.

In the [[Zaydi|Zaydi imamate]] of [[Yemen]], Jews were also singled out for discrimination in the 17th century, which culminated in the general expulsion of all Jews from places in Yemen to the arid coastal plain of [[Tihamah]] and which became known as the [[Mawza Exile]].&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim'' (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem 1989, pp. 714–716 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enlightenment===
In 1744, Archduchess of Austria [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] ordered Jews out of [[Bohemia]] but soon reversed her position, on the condition that Jews pay for their readmission every ten years. This [[extortion]] was known among the Jews as ''[[malke-geld]]'' ("queen's money" in Yiddish).&lt;ref name="Singer et al. 1906, Under Maria Teresa"&gt;{{cite book|author-last=Büchler|author-first=Alexander|chapter=Hungary|editor1-last=Singer|editor1-first=Isidore|title=The Jewish Encyclopedia|date=1904|publisher=Funk and Wagnalls Co.|location=New York and London|volume=6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/TheJewishEncyclopediaVIGodIstria/page/n511 494–503]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1752, she introduced the law limiting each Jewish family to one son.

In 1782, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] abolished most of these persecution practices in his ''[[Toleranzpatent]]'',&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, H.C. Ideas of Religious Toleration at the time of Joseph II. ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ingrao, W. Charles, ''The Habsburg Monarchy 1618-1815'', Cambridge University Press, 1994, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; on the condition that [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] were eliminated from public records and that judicial autonomy was annulled.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, H.C. Ideas of Religious Toleration at the time of Joseph II. ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'', p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moses Mendelssohn]] wrote that "Such a tolerance... is even more dangerous play in tolerance than open persecution."

====Voltaire====
According to [[Arnold Ages]], [[Voltaire]]'s "Lettres philosophiques, Dictionnaire philosophique, and Candide, to name but a few of his better known works, are saturated with comments on Jews and Judaism and the vast majority are negative".&lt;ref&gt;Ages Arnold. "Tainted Greatness: The Case of Voltaire's Anti-Semitism: The Testimony of the Correspondence." Neohelicon 21.2 (Sept. 1994): 361.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul H.

"The Attitude of the Enlightenment Toward the Jew."

From 1804, Jews were banned from their villages and began to stream into the towns.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson, ''A History of the Jews'', Harper Perennial, 1986, p 358&lt;/ref&gt; A decree by emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia]] in 1827 conscripted Jews under 18 years of age into the [[cantonist]] schools for a 25-year military service in order to promote baptism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Military_Service_in_Russia|title=Military Service in Russia|author-link1=Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern|last=Petrovsky-Shtern|first=Yohanan|date=8 June 2017|website=YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe|access-date=20 October 2017|archive-date=7 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210207052626/https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Military_Service_in_Russia|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Policy towards Jews was liberalised somewhat under [[Czar Alexander II]] ({{reign|1855|1881}}).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson, ''A History of the Jews'', Harper Perennial, 1986, p 359&lt;/ref&gt; However, his assassination in 1881 served as a pretext for further repression such as the [[May Laws]] of 1882. [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]], nicknamed the "black czar" and tutor to the [[czarevitch]], later crowned [[Czar Nicholas II]], declared that "One-third of the Jews must die, one-third must emigrate, and one third be converted to Christianity".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Van der Kiste]],''The Romanovs 1818–1959'', Sutton, 1998, p 104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic antisemitism in the 19th century===
Historian [[Martin Gilbert]] writes that it was in the 19th century that the position of Jews worsened in [[Muslim]] countries. [[Benny Morris]] writes that one symbol of Jewish degradation was the phenomenon of stone-throwing at Jews by Muslim children. Morris quotes a 19th-century traveler: "I have seen a little fellow of six years old, with a troop of fat toddlers of only three and four, teaching [them] to throw stones at a Jew, and one little urchin would, with the greatest coolness, waddle up to the man and literally spit upon his Jewish [[gaberdine]]. To all this the Jew is obliged to submit; it would be more than his life was worth to offer to strike a Mahommedan."&lt;ref name="Morris10"&gt;[[Benny Morris|Morris, Benny]]. ''[[iarchive:righteousvictims0000morr|Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881–2001]]''. Vintage Books, 2001, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 19th century, [[J. J. Benjamin]] wrote about the life of [[Persian Jews]], describing conditions and beliefs that went back to the 16th century: "…they are obliged to live in a separate part of town… Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt…."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Bernard|last=Lewis|title=The Jews of Islam|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|year=1984|pages=181–183|isbn=978-0-691-00807-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jerusalem at least, conditions for some Jews improved. [[Moses Montefiore]], on his seventh visit in 1875, noted that fine new buildings had sprung up and, "surely we're approaching the time to witness God's hallowed promise unto Zion." Muslim and Christian Arabs participated in [[Purim]] and [[Passover]]; Arabs called the [[Sephardi]]s 'Jews, sons of Arabs'; the [[Ulema]] and the Rabbis offered joint prayers for rain in time of drought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], ''Jerusalem'', Phoenix, 2011, pp. 429–432&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the Dreyfus trial in France, "Muslim comments usually favoured the persecuted Jew against his Christian persecutors".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lewis]], ''What Went Wrong?'', Phoenix, 2002, p 172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secular or racial antisemitism===
[[Image:Wagner Das Judenthum in der Musik 1869.jpg|thumb|Title page of the second edition of ''Das Judenthum in der Musik'', published in 1869]]
[[File:L Agitation-Antisemite.jpg|thumb|Antisemitic agitators in Paris burn an effigy of Mathieu Dreyfus during the [[Dreyfus affair]]]]

In 1850, the German composer [[Richard Wagner]] – who has been called "the inventor of modern antisemitism"&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt; – published ''[[Das Judenthum in der Musik]]'' (roughly "Jewishness in Music"&lt;ref name=bismarck&gt;[[Jonathan Steinberg (historian)|Steinberg, Jonathan]] (2011) ''Bismarck: A Life'' New York: Oxford, pp.388–90. {{ISBN|978-0-19-997539-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;) under a [[pseudonym]] in the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]''. The essay began as an attack on Jewish composers, particularly Wagner's contemporaries, and rivals, [[Felix Mendelssohn]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], but expanded to accuse Jews of being a harmful and alien element in [[Culture of Germany|German culture]], who corrupted morals and were, in fact, parasites incapable of creating truly "German" art. The crux was the manipulation and control by the Jews of the money economy:&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt;

{{blockquote|According to the present constitution of this world, the Jew in truth is already more than emancipated: he rules, and will rule, so long as Money remains the power before which all our doings and our dealings lose their force.&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt;}}

Although originally published anonymously, when the essay was republished 19 years later, in 1869, the concept of the corrupting Jew had become so widely held that Wagner's name was affixed to it.&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt;
 
Antisemitism can also be found in many of the [[Grimms' Fairy Tales]] by [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]], published from 1812 to 1857. It is mainly characterized by Jews being the [[villain]] of a story, such as in "The Good Bargain" ("''Der gute Handel"'') and "[[The Jew Among Thorns]]" (''"Der Jude im Dorn"'').

The middle 19th century saw continued official harassment of the Jews, especially in Eastern Europe under Czarist influence. For example, in 1846, 80 Jews approached the governor in Warsaw to retain the right to wear their traditional dress but were immediately rebuffed by having their hair and beards forcefully cut, at their own expense.&lt;ref name=BDE&gt;{{cite bklyn|title=The Despot of Russia...|image=50249029|date=22 December 1846|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even such influential figures as [[Walt Whitman]] tolerated bigotry toward the Jews in America. During his time as editor of the Brooklyn Eagle (1846–1848), the newspaper published historical sketches casting Jews in a bad light.&lt;ref name=BDE-Whitman&gt;{{cite bklyn|title=Anecdotes of Jews, and their peculiar traits|image=50243090|page=2|date=8 January 1847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dreyfus Affair]] was an infamous antisemitic event of the late 19th century and early 20th century. [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a Jewish artillery [[wikt:captain|captain]] in the [[French Army]], was accused in 1894 of passing secrets to the Germans. As a result of these charges, Dreyfus was convicted and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] on [[Devil's Island]]. The actual spy, Marie Charles Esterhazy, was acquitted. The event caused great uproar among the French, with the public choosing sides on the issue of whether Dreyfus was actually guilty or not. [[Émile Zola]] accused the army of corrupting the French justice system. However, general consensus held that Dreyfus was guilty: 80% of the press in France condemned him. This attitude among the majority of the French population reveals the underlying antisemitism of the time period.&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, Michael. (2005) Nineteenth Century Europe. New York: Palgrave MacMillan {{ISBN|0333652460}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Stoecker]] (1835–1909), the [[Lutheran]] court chaplain to [[Kaiser Wilhelm I]], founded in 1878 an antisemitic, [[Liberalism|anti-liberal]] political party called the [[Christian Social Party (Germany)|Christian Social Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harold M.

Some scholars view [[Karl Marx]]'s essay "[[On The Jewish Question]]" as antisemitic, and argue that he often used antisemitic epithets in his published and private writings.{{sfnp|Flannery|2004|p=168}}&lt;ref name="Jacobs2005"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Marx, Karl (1818–1883)|title=Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution|last=Jacobs|first=Jack|editor=Levy, Richard S.|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, CA|isbn=978-1-85109-439-4|pages=446–447}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Lewis|1999|p=112}} These scholars argue that Marx equated Judaism with capitalism in his essay, helping to spread that idea.

Others argue that Marx consistently supported Prussian Jewish communities' struggles to achieve equal political rights. These scholars argue that "On the Jewish Question" is a critique of Bruno Bauer's arguments that Jews must convert to Christianity before being emancipated, and is more generally a critique of liberal rights discourses and capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;David McLellan (1970) ''Marx before Marxism'': pp. 141–142.{{full citation needed|date=July 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Y.

David McLellan and [[Francis Wheen]] argue that readers should interpret ''On the Jewish Question'' in the deeper context of Marx's debates with [[Bruno Bauer]], author of ''[[The Jewish Question]]'', about [[Jewish emancipation]] in Germany. Wheen says that "Those critics, who see this as a foretaste of 'Mein Kampf', overlook one, essential point: in spite of the clumsy phraseology and crude stereotyping, the essay was actually written as a defense of the Jews. It was a retort to Bruno Bauer, who had argued that Jews should not be granted full civic rights and freedoms unless they were baptised as Christians".&lt;ref&gt;Wheen, F., Karl Marx, p. 56.{{full citation needed|date=July 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to McLellan, Marx used the word ''Judentum'' colloquially, as meaning ''commerce'', arguing that Germans must be emancipated from the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] not Judaism or Jews in particular. McLellan concludes that readers should interpret the essay's second half as "an extended pun at Bauer's expense".{{sfnp|McLellan|1980|p=142}}

Between 1900 and 1924, approximately 1.75&amp;nbsp;million Jews migrated to America, the bulk from Eastern Europe escaping [[Pogroms in the Russian Empire|the pogroms]]. This increase, combined with the [[upward social mobility]] of some Jews, contributed to a resurgence of antisemitism. In the first half of the 20th century, in the US, Jews were discriminated against in employment, access to residential and resort areas, membership in clubs and organizations, and in tightened quotas on Jewish enrolment and teaching positions in colleges and universities. The lynching of [[Leo Frank]] by a mob of prominent citizens in [[Marietta, Georgia]], in 1915 turned the spotlight on antisemitism in the United States.{{sfnp|Chanes|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ju7U83nRDt8C&amp;pg=PA72 72]}} The case was also used to build support for the renewal of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] which had been inactive since 1870.{{sfnp|Levy|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tdn6FFZklkcC&amp;pg=PA243 vol. 1, p.&amp;nbsp;72]}}

At the beginning of the 20th century, the [[Menahem Mendel Beilis|Beilis Trial]] in Russia represented modern incidents of [[blood libel|blood-libel]]s in Europe.

Antisemitism in America reached its peak during the [[interwar period]]. The pioneer automobile manufacturer [[Henry Ford]] propagated antisemitic ideas in his newspaper ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]'' (published by Ford from 1919 to 1927). The radio speeches of [[Father Coughlin]] in the late 1930s attacked [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] and promoted the notion of a Jewish financial conspiracy. Some prominent politicians shared such views: [[Louis T. McFadden]], Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Banking and Currency]], blamed Jews for Roosevelt's decision to abandon the [[gold standard]], and claimed that "in the United States today, the Gentiles have the slips of paper while the Jews have the lawful money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arad|first=Gulie Ne'eman|title=America, Its Jews, and the Rise of Nazism|year=2000|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|location=Indianapolis|isbn=978-0-253-33809-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/americaitsjewsri00arad/page/174 174]|url=https://archive.org/details/americaitsjewsri00arad/page/174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1935, the [[Nuremberg Laws]] prohibited sexual relations and marriages between "Aryans" and Jews as ''[[Rassenschande]]'' ("race disgrace") and stripped all German Jews, even quarter- and [[half-Jew]]s, of their citizenship (their official title became "subjects of the state").{{sfnp|Majer|2014|pp=113, 116, 118}} It instituted a pogrom on the night of 9–10 November 1938, dubbed ''[[Kristallnacht]]'', in which Jews were killed, their property destroyed and their synagogues torched.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw (2008) ''Fateful Choices'': 441–44&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemitic laws, agitation and propaganda were extended to [[German-occupied Europe]] in the wake of conquest, often building on local antisemitic traditions.

==Contemporary antisemitism==

===Post-WWII antisemitism===
{{See also|Soviet anti-Zionism|Soviet anti-Semitism}}

There have continued to be antisemitic incidents since WWII, some of which had been state-sponsored. In the [[Soviet Union]], antisemitism was even used as an instrument for settling personal conflicts, starting with the conflict between [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] and continuing through numerous conspiracy theories spread by official propaganda. [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|Antisemitism in the USSR]] reached new heights after 1948 during the campaign against the "[[rootless cosmopolitan]]" (euphemism for "Jew") in which numerous Yiddish-language poets, writers, painters, and sculptors were killed or arrested.&lt;ref name="jcws"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Konstantin Azadovskii and Boris Egorov|title=From Anti-Westernism to Anti-Semitism|journal=Journal of Cold War Studies|year=2002|volume=4:1|issue=Winter|pages=66–80|url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hpcws/egorov.htm#REF31|access-date=1 December 2008|archive-date=20 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210220161918/https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~hpcws/egorov.htm#REF31|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Myth"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of the Jewish Race|author1=Raphael|author2=Jennifer Patai|year=1989|page=178|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=978-0-8143-1948-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated in the antisemitic conspiracy theory of the '[[Doctors' Plot]]' in 1952.

In the 20th century, [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Antisemitism in Russia|Russian]] antisemitism underwent significant transformations, shaped by political, social, and ideological shifts. During the early Soviet period, the [[Bolsheviks]] initially condemned antisemitism, seeing it as incompatible with [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideology. However, under [[Joseph Stalin]]'s regime, antisemitism reemerged, often cloaked in 'anti-Zionist' rhetoric. As early as 1943, Stalin and his propagandists intensified attacks against Jews as "[[rootless cosmopolitan]]s".&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|date=25 January 2024|title=More than a Century of Antisemitism: How Successive Occupants of the Kremlin Have Used Antisemitism|url=https://www.state.gov/more-than-a-century-of-antisemitism-how-successive-occupants-of-the-kremlin-have-used-antisemitism/|access-date=29 July 2024|website=[[United States Department of State]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Party issued confidential directives to fire Jews from positions of power, but state-controlled media did not openly attack Jews until the late 1940s.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The [[Doctors' plot]] of 1952, a fabricated conspiracy accusing predominantly Jewish doctors of attempting to assassinate Soviet leaders, exemplified this resurgence. This campaign fostered widespread antisemitic sentiments and resulted in the arrest and execution of numerous Jewish professionals.

In that same year, the antisemitic [[Slánský trial|Slánský show trial]] alleged the existence of an 'international Zionist conspiracy' to destroy Socialism. Izabella Tabarovsky, a scholar of the history of antisemitism, argues that, "Manufactured by the Soviet secret services, the trial tied together Zionism, Israel, Jewish leaders, and American imperialism, turning 'Zionism' and 'Zionist' into dangerous labels that could be used against one's political enemies."&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Tabarovsky|first=Izabella|date=1 May 2019|title=Soviet Anti-Zionism and Contemporary Left Antisemitism|url=https://fathomjournal.org/soviet-anti-zionism-and-contemporary-left-antisemitism/|access-date=29 July 2024|website=Fathom Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-Stalin era, state-sanctioned antisemitism persisted and intensified.In February 1953, the Soviet Union severed diplomatic relations with the [[Israel|State of Israel]] and "soon the state media was saturated with anti-Zionist propaganda, depicting bloated, hook-nosed Jewish bankers and all-consuming serpents embossed with the Star of David."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Ryvchin|first=Alex|date=10 September 2019|title=Red Terror: How the Soviet Union Shaped the Modern Anti-Zionist Discourse|url=https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/red-terror-how-the-soviet-union-shaped-the-modern-anti-zionist-discourse/|access-date=29 July 2024|website=[[Australian Institute of International Affairs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1963 publication of the antisemitic book ''[[Judaism Without Embellishment]],'' written under orders from the central Soviet government, echoed [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|Nazi propaganda]], alleging a global Jewish conspiracy to subvert the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;  It was the beginning of a new wave of government-sponsored anti-Semitism.

The [[Six-Day War]] in 1967 led to an intensification in Soviet anti-Zionist propaganda as the Soviets had backed the defeated Arab states.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This propaganda often blurred the lines with antisemitism, leading to discriminatory policies against Jews and restricting their emigration. By the end of the war, "the "corporate Jew", whether "cosmopolitan" or "Zionist", became identified as the enemy.

It also engaged in a wide-scale propaganda campaign between 1967 and 1988 overseen by the [[KGB]] and published pamphlets featuring antisemitic conspiracy theories, for example falsely claiming that Zionist Jews collaborated with the Nazi regime in the Holocaust and of inflating the significance and scale of anti-Jewish persecution.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Their propaganda frequently borrowed directly from the forged [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Protocols of the Elders of Zion]] and sometimes relied upon [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' as a source of information about Zionism.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Antizionism helped Moscow "bond both with its Arab allies and the Western hard left of all shades.

Its chairman, Ivan Udaltsov, published a memorandum on 27 January 1971, to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] in which he claimed that "Zionists, by provoking antisemitism, recruit volunteers for the Israeli army", blaming Jews for antisemitism, and falsely alleged that Zionists were responsible for "subversive activities" during the 1968 [[Prague Spring]].&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; According to historian [[William Korey]], "Judaism was singled out for condemnation as prescribing 'racial exclusivism' and as justifying 'crimes against 'Gentiles.'"&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

In Eastern Europe the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the instability of the new states brought the rise of nationalist movements and the accusation against Jews for the economic crisis, taking over the local economy and bribing the government, along with traditional and religious motives for antisemitism such as [[blood libel]]s. Writing on the [[rhetoric]] surrounding the 2022 [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]], [[Jason Stanley]] relates these perceptions to broader historical narratives: "the dominant version of antisemitism alive in parts of eastern Europe today is that Jews employ the Holocaust to seize the victimhood narrative from the 'real' victims of the Nazis, who are Russian Christians (or other non-Jewish eastern Europeans)".&lt;ref name="Stanley 2022"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Stanley|first=Jason|date=26 February 2022|title=The antisemitism animating Putin's claim to 'denazify' Ukraine|author-link=Jason Stanley|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/vladimir-putin-ukraine-attack-antisemitism-denazify|access-date=6 March 2022|archive-date=17 April 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220417105216/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/vladimir-putin-ukraine-attack-antisemitism-denazify|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He calls out the "myths of contemporary eastern European antisemitism – that a global cabal of Jews were (and are) the real agents of violence against Russian Christians and the real victims of the Nazis were not the Jews, but rather this group."&lt;ref name="Stanley 2022" /&gt;

Most of the antisemitic incidents in Eastern Europe are against Jewish cemeteries and buildings (community centers and synagogues).

=== Antisemitism on the internet ===
Antisemitism on the internet involves a complex interplay between social media dynamics, conspiracy theories, and the broader socio-political context. Social media platforms have proved fertile for breeding antisemitic rhetoric, particularly during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, during which a notable rise in antisemitic conspiracy theories emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Sundberg, K., Mitchell, L., &amp; Levinson, D. (2022). Health, religiosity and hatred: a study of the impacts of covid-19 on world jewry.

Coronavirus misinformation: quantifying sources and themes in the covid-19 ‘infodemic’.&lt;/ref&gt; The role of social media in amplifying these sentiments is underscored by analyses of comment sections on major media outlets, which reveal a significant presence of antisemitic discourse, often framed within the context of political events and international relations.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, M., Ascone, L., &amp; Troschke, H.

The British Journal of Politics and International Relations, 24(3), 458-474.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the emergence of TikTok as a new platform has raised concerns about the proliferation of antisemitic content, with studies highlighting the challenges of moderating such material effectively.&lt;ref&gt;McMann, T., Calac, A., Nali, M., Cuomo, R., Maroulis, J., &amp; Mackey, T.

Tiktok’s spiral of antisemitism: a study case in indonesia. Ekspresi Dan Persepsi Jurnal Ilmu Komunikasi, 6(3), 547-553.&lt;/ref&gt; The intersection of antisemitism with broader themes of populism and right-wing extremism is also evident, as these ideologies often utilize antisemitic narratives to galvanize support and create a sense of otherness.&lt;ref name=Subotić/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ichau, E., Frissen, T., &amp; d’Haenens, L. (2019). From #selfie to #edgy. hashtag networks and images associated with the hashtag #jews on instagram. Telematics and Informatics, 44, 101275.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the phenomenon of subtle hate speech has been identified, where antisemitic sentiments are recontextualized in ways that may evade direct detection yet still perpetuate harmful stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;Serafis, D.

(2023). Wikipedia’s Intentional Distortion of the History of the Holocaust. The Journal of Holocaust Research, 37(2), 133-190.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the digital landscape presents both challenges and opportunities for combating antisemitism, necessitating a multifaceted approach that includes community engagement and technological solutions to monitor and counteract hate speech effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Ozalp, S., Williams, M., Burnap, P., Liu, H., &amp; Mostafa, M.

==Causes==
Antisemitism has been explained in terms of [[racism]], [[xenophobia]], [[Psychological projection|projected guilt]], [[displaced aggression]], [[conspiracy theory]], and the search for a [[Scapegoating|scapegoat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jews in the early modern world|first=Dean Phillip|last=Bell|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2008|page=212|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5rJ85OyVWV0C&amp;pg=PA212|isbn=978-0-7425-4518-2|access-date=23 August 2020|archive-date=30 December 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231230001601/https://books.google.com/books?id=5rJ85OyVWV0C&amp;pg=PA212#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antisemitism scholar Lars Fischer writes that "scholars distinguish between theories that assume an actual causal (rather than merely coincidental) correlation between what (some) Jews do and antisemitic perceptions (correspondence theories), on the one hand, and those predicated on the notion that no such causal correlation exists and that 'the Jews' serve as a foil for the projection of antisemitic assumptions, on the other."&lt;ref name="u458"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Lars|title="The word 'Jew' has several meanings in relation to commerce, but almost all negative": on the evolution of a projection|journal=Jewish Historical Studies|volume=51|issue=1|date=27 April 2020|issn=2397-1290|doi=10.14324/111.444.jhs.2020v51.032}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter position is exemplified by [[Theodor W.

As an example of the correspondence theory, an 1894 book by [[Bernard Lazare]] questions whether Jews themselves were to blame for some antisemitic stereotypes, for instance arguing that Jews traditionally keeping strictly to their own communities, with their own practices and laws, led to a perception of Jews as anti-social; he later abandoned this belief and the book is considered antisemitic today.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VP81v2Y24HUC&amp;pg=PA9 Page 9] in: {{cite book|title=Anti-Semitism: Its History and Causes|author=Bernard Lazare|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|year=2006|isbn=9781596056015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brustein|first1=William L.|last2=Roberts|first2=Louisa|title=The Scialism of Fools: Leftist Origins of Modern Anti-Semitism|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=55|quote=Lazare argued in his book that Jews, because of their exclusiveness, arrogance, and unsociability, were themselves responsible for anti-Semitism.

In ''Anti-Judaism: The Western Tradition'' (2013), historian [[David Nirenberg]] traces the history of antisemitism, arguing that antisemitism should be understood not as a product of isolated historical events or cultural biases but is instead embedded within the very fabric of Western thought and society.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nirenberg|first=David|author-link=David Nirenberg|title=Anti-Judaism: The Western Tradition|publisher=Norton|year=2014|isbn=978-0-393-34791-3|edition=1. publ. as Norton paperb|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its foundation lies in the early claim of [[Jewish deicide]] and depictions of Jews as 'Christ-killers'. Throughout Western history, Jews have since been used as a symbolic '[[Other (philosophy)|other]]' to define and articulate the values and boundaries of various cultures and intellectual traditions. In philosophy, literature, and politics, Jewishness has often been constructed as a counterpoint to what is considered normative or ideal. One of the key insights from Nirenberg's work is that antisemitism has proven to be remarkably adaptable. It changes form and adapts to different contexts and times, whether in medieval religious disputes, Enlightenment critiques, or modern racial theories. Philosophers and intellectuals have often used 'Jewishness' as a foil to explore and define their ideas. For instance, in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], figures like [[Voltaire]] critiqued Judaism as backward and superstitious to promote their visions of reason and progress. Similarly, the [[Soviet Union]] frequently [[Soviet anti-Semitism|portrayed]] Judaism as linked with capitalism and mercantilism, standing in opposition to the ideals of proletarian solidarity and [[communism]]. In each case, Judaism or the Jews are portrayed as standing in tension with prevailing moral norms.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

British [[quantum physicist]] [[David Deutsch]] has argued that antisemites have historically always attempted to provide some sort of justification for their persecution of Jews. He uses the term 'The Pattern' to describe what he argues underlies historical antisemitism: "the maintenance of the idea that it is legitimate to hurt Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hall|first=Brett|date=1 November 2023|title=Antisemitism: The Sinister Pattern|url=https://quillette.com/2023/11/01/antisemitism-the-sinister-pattern/|access-date=29 July 2024|website=[[Quillette]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He provides the following examples:

# The idea that Jews have collectively failed some crucial test (e.g. they rejected Jesus, or Mohammed, or do not have the Aryans' capacity for 'culture', or do not satisfy Stalin's criteria for being a 'nation', or lack a mystical 'connection to the land', etc.);
# The idea that Jews cause pollution – for instance that they are [[Antisemitic trope|poisoning the water supply]], or that they desecrate holy sites and artefacts – which is often extended, semi-metaphorically, to the idea that Jews are pollution/vermin/rotten/cancer etc.;
# [[Blood libel]]s, the classic one being that Jews kidnap and murder non-Jewish children and consume their blood in religious rituals;
# The incorporation of an entity called 'The Jews' deeply into the fabric of many cultures as the eternal enemy bent on destroying whatever that culture values; and
# Conspiracy theories, especially theories that 'The Jews' are secretly 'behind' the events of history and current affairs.

British medievalist historian Richard Landes has further argued that,&lt;blockquote&gt;This Pattern, Deutsch observes, is always present, but is most likely to cause persecution, expulsions and mass murder when there is a serious threat it, to the ''legitimacy'' of hurting Jews. Such a threat appeared when Europeans, previously Pattern-compliant in their belief in Jewish deicide, became 'Enlightened,' and so had difficulty blaming the Jews for killing a God in which they no longer believed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Landes|first=Richard|author-link=Richard Landes|date=2023-11-01|title=Lethal Journalism and the Pattern: Why the World Fell for Hamas' Al Ahli Lie|url=https://fathomjournal.org/fathom-long-read-lethal-journalism-and-the-pattern-why-the-world-fell-for-hamas-al-ahli-lie/|access-date=2024-07-29|website=Fathom Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key to people's behavior in this regard, he argues, is the need to preserve the legitimacy of hurting Jews, for being Jews. This legitimacy is much more important than actually hurting Jews. And it targets only the Jews. It is not, accordingly, either a hatred or a fear, a form of racism or prejudice in the conventional sense, even though it can lead to those feelings and attitudes. But it is actually unique. No other group can substitute for the Jews as the target whom it is legitimate to hurt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Landes|first=Richard|author-link=Richard Landes|date=2019-08-30|title=The Small Matter of Malice: Meditations on "the Pattern" of Antisemitism|url=https://isgap.org/flashpoint/the-small-matter-of-malice-the-pattern-of-antisemitism-now-and-then-meditations-on-the-pattern-of-antisemitism/|access-date=2024-07-29|website=[[Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Author and scholar [[Dara Horn]] published an article in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' reflecting on her previous published doubts about the effectiveness of [[Holocaust education]] [[pedagogy]] and the rising antisemitism in the wake of the [[October 7th Massacre]] in Israel by Palestinians.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In it, Horn argues that antisemitism functions by appropriating what has happened to Jews and recasting their experience as part of a broader, universal struggle, which always ends in ultimately redefining Jewish identity as incompatible with these ideals. In particular, Jewish particularism is perceived as an aggression against a supposedly more enlightened universalism. By rejecting this new universalism, the Jews are thus judged to have failed a crucial moral test. As a result, hatred of Jews becomes a sign of moral righteousness. Historically, this pattern manifests in various ways: Christianity and Islam each claimed to embody a universal truth that Jews rejected, justifying persecution. In the modern era, German [[Pseudoscientific racism|pseudo-scientific racism]] and [[Social Darwinism]] defined Jews as an inferior race threatening societal progress, while the [[Soviet Union]] positioned itself as the victim of Nazism, obscuring the Jewish suffering during the Holocaust and framing Jews as oppressors through its [[Soviet anti-Zionism|propaganda about Zionism]]. Horn concludes that the attacks on Jews, often under the guise of anti-Zionism, follow the same ancient pattern of marginalization and vilification.&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the permission structure for anti-Semitism: claim whatever has happened to the Jews as one's own experience, announce a "universal" ideal that all good people must accept, and then redefine Jewish collective identity as lying beyond it. Hating Jews thus becomes a demonstration of righteousness. The key is to define, and redefine, and redefine again, the shiny new moral reasoning for why the Jews have failed the universal test of humanity.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Horn|first=Dara|author-link=Dara Horn|date=2024-10-07|title=October 7 Created a Permission Structure for Anti-Semitism|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/10/october-7-anti-semitism-united-states/680176/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20241010011236/https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/10/october-7-anti-semitism-united-states/680176/|archive-date=2024-10-10|access-date=2024-10-15|website=[[The Atlantic (magazine)|The Atlantic]]|issn=2151-9463}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Education]] plays an important role in addressing and overcoming [[prejudice]] and countering social [[discrimination]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000263702|title=Addressing anti-semitism through education: guidelines for policymakers|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100274-8|access-date=9 March 2020|archive-date=17 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210117130019/https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000263702|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, education is not only about challenging the conditions of intolerance and ignorance in which antisemitism manifests itself; it is also about building a sense of [[Global citizenship education|global citizenship]] and solidarity, respect for, and enjoyment of diversity and the ability to live peacefully together as active, democratic citizens. Education equips learners with the knowledge to identify antisemitism and biased or prejudiced messages and raises awareness about the forms, manifestations, and impact of antisemitism faced by [[Jews]] and Jewish communities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Some Jewish writers have argued that public education about antisemitism through the prism of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] is unhelpful at best or actively deepening antisemitism at worst. [[Dara Horn]] wrote in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' that "Auschwitz is not a metaphor", arguing "That the Holocaust drives home the importance of love is an idea, like the idea that Holocaust education prevents anti-Semitism, that seems entirely unobjectionable. It is entirely objectionable. The Holocaust didn't happen because of a lack of love. It happened because entire societies abdicated responsibility for their own problems, and instead blamed them on the people who represented—have always represented, since they first introduced the idea of commandedness to the world—the thing they were most afraid of: responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Horn|first=Dara|author-link=Dara Horn|date=6 June 2019|title=Auschwitz Is Not a Metaphor|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/auschwitz-not-long-ago-not-far-away/591082/|access-date=29 July 2024|website=[[The Atlantic]]|issn=2151-9463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, she argues that perhaps "a more effective way to address anti-Semitism might lie in cultivating a completely different quality, one that happens to be the key to education itself: curiosity. Why use Jews as a means to teach people that we're all the same, when the demand that Jews be just like their neighbors is exactly what embedded the mental virus of anti-Semitism in the Western mind in the first place? Why not instead encourage inquiry about the diversity, to borrow a de rigueur word, of the human experience?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Horn|first=Dara|author-link=Dara Horn|date=3 April 2023|title=Is Holocaust Education Making Anti-Semitism Worse?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/05/holocaust-student-education-jewish-anti-semitism/673488/|access-date=29 July 2024|work=The Atlantic|issn=2151-9463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical variation==
{{Main|Geography of antisemitism}}

A March 2008 report by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] found that there was an increase in antisemitism across the world, and that both old and new expressions of antisemitism persist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/US/03/14/anti-semitism/index.html "Report: Anti-Semitism on the rise globally"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315181305/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/US/03/14/anti-semitism/index.html |date=15 March 2008 }}, [[CNN]], 14 March 2008. Retrieved 24 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 report by the U.S. [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor]] also noted a continued global increase in antisemitism, and found that Holocaust denial and opposition to Israeli policy at times was used to promote or justify blatant antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Religious Freedom Report for 2012|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper|access-date=21 December 2013|archive-date=7 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207121457/https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Anti-Defamation League conducted a study titled ''ADL Global 100: An Index of Anti-Semitism'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://global100.adl.org/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601015413/http://global100.adl.org/public/ADL-Global-100-Executive-Summary.pdf|archive-date=1 June 2016|title=ADL Global 100: A Survey of Attitudes Toward Jews in Over 100 Countries Around the World|website=ADL/Global 100|access-date=14 January 2024|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also reported high antisemitism figures around the world and, among other findings, that as many as "27% of people who have never met a Jew nevertheless harbor strong prejudices against him".&lt;ref name="TOI-ADL"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gur|first=Haviv Rettig|author-link=Haviv Rettig Gur|title=Hating the Jew you've never met|website=The Times of Israel|date=18 May 2014|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/hating-the-jew-youve-never-met/|access-date=26 August 2018|archive-date=1 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601140048/https://www.timesofisrael.com/hating-the-jew-youve-never-met/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2024, the Israeli Ministry of the Diaspora announced a new antisemitism monitoring project.&lt;ref name=Diaspora1&gt;{{cite news|last=Starr|first=Michael|date=19 August 2024|title=Can Diaspora Ministry's new monitoring system help better understand antisemitism?|url=https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/article-815377|work=The Jerusalem Post|access-date=20 August 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Diaspora2&gt;{{cite news|date=18 August 2024|title=Diaspora Ministry unveils system for monitoring antisemitic discourse online|url=https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/article-815209|work=The Jerusalem Post|access-date=20 August 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the project is to measure levels of antisemitism in various countries, as well as identify instigators and trends.&lt;ref name=Diaspora1 /&gt; In the event that antisemitism in a given country gets bad, the Israeli government may reach out to the local government to try to rectify the situation.&lt;ref name=Diaspora1 /&gt;
