'''Media portrayal of LGBT people''' ranges from positive to very negative. The [[gay community]] is constantly battling with the negative image and trying to overcome [[LGBT stereotypes|stereotypes]] in television, films and other media.  However, coverage has become more positive in recent years, possibly in an attempt by marketers to appeal to [[LGBT]] people.

==Overview==
Since [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] and [[transgender]] people look just like anyone else, the media often adds images to make the gay community as visible as a difference in skin color.  In many forms of popular entertainment, gays are portrayed as overly promiscuous, flashy and incredibly bold.  

There is currently a widespread view that reference to gays should be omitted from child-related entertainment. When such references do occur they almost invariably generate controversy. In 1997, when American comedian [[Ellen DeGeneres]] [[coming out|came out]] of the [[closeted|closet]] on her popular [[sitcom]], many sponsors, such as the [[Wendy's]] fast food chain, pulled their advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gomestic.com/Consumer-Information/10-Unique-Facts-Regarding-the-Fast-food-Franchise-with-the-Old-fashioned-Burgers-Wendys.427675|title=10 Unique Facts Regarding the Fast-food Franchise with the Old-fashioned Burgers: Wendy’s|year=2009|work=Gomestic|publisher=Stanza Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the stereotypical depictions of gays, the media has at times promoted acceptance of gays with television shows such as ''[[Will and Grace]]'' and ''[[Queer Eye]]''.  This increased publicity reflects the coming-out movement of the LGBT community.  As more celebrities come out, more gay-friendly shows develop, such as the 2004 show ''[[The L Word]]''.  With the popularity of gay television shows, music artists and gay fashion, Western culture has had to open its eyes to the gay community.  

In the United States, gay people are frequently used as a symbol of social decadence by celebrity evangelists and by organizations such as [[Focus on the Family]]. 

In [[Québec]], ''RG Magazine'' was a major defender of LGBT causes for some 30 years.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==News coverage of LGBT events==
Much of the negative media that surrounds the gay community has to do with [[pride parade]]s that turn into [[drag queen|drag shows]] or [[riots]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  Opposition argues that such degrees of sexuality and nudity in public is not appropriate.  News stories have typically identified the opposition to these demonstrations as led by [[Christian]] conservatives and not political figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishnews.com/appnews/540/5860/2008/8/4/594333_353231713890GayPride.html Gay Pride parade attracts thousands.  The Irish News.  April 4, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing to the LGBT community==
The gay community has been targeted by marketers who view LGBT people as an untapped source of [[Disposable and discretionary income|discretionary spending]], as many couples have two income streams and no children. As a result, companies are advertising more and more to the gay community, and LGBT activists use advertisement slogans to promote gay community views.  [[Subaru]] marketed its "Forester" and "Outback" models with the slogan "It's not a choice. It's the way we're built" which was later used in eight United States cities on streets or in gay rights events.&lt;ref&gt;Fetto, John.

==LGBT media advocacy organizations==
Many LGBT organizations exist to represent and defend the gay community. For example, the [[Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] in the United States and [[Stonewall (UK)|Stonewall]] in the UK work with the media to help portray fair and accurate images of the gay community.
