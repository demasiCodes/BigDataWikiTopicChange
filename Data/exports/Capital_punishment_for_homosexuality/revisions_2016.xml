It is currently still extant in a fairly small number of countries or parts of countries, mostly or all due to [[sharia law]].   Even though the law may allow the death penalty it does not mean that it is carried out.  Conversely ''de facto'' death penalties may apply, for example the [[Washington Post]] said that in Iraq "The penal code does not expressly prohibit homosexual acts, but people have been killed by militias and sentenced to death by judges citing sharia law."

==Current regimes with the death penalty==

There is legal dispute whether the law of the [[United Arab Emirates]] allows for the death penalty for homosexuality, however [[Amnesty International]] could find no instances of the death penalty.&lt;ref name="WP" /&gt;

==Other entities supporting the death penalty==

==Historical==

===UK===
From 1533 it was a capital felony for any person to "commit the detestable and abominable vice of buggery with mankind or beast," was repealed and re-enacted several times, until it was reinstated in 1563 remaining unchanged until 1861.&lt;ref name="Colonial"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1061&amp;context=englishfacpubs|work=Journal of Homosexuality|volume=1|issue=3|date=1976|title=Homosexuals and the Death Penalty in Colonial America|author=Louis Crompton|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States and colonial America===
{{See also|Sodomy laws in the United States}}
Colonial America had the laws of the United Kingdom, and the revolutionary states took many of those laws as the basis of their own, in some cases verbatim.&lt;ref name="Colonial" /&gt;  The last law where the death penalty was on the statute books was South Carolina, the old British law was repealed until 1873, twelve years after the mother country.&lt;ref name="Colonial" /&gt;

The number of times the penalty was carried out is unknown, records support two executions, and a number of more uncertain convections, such as "crimes against nature".&lt;ref name="Colonial" /&gt;
