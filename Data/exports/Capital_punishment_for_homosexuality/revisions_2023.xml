[[Capital punishment]] as [[criminalization of homosexuality|a criminal punishment]] for [[homosexuality]] has been implemented by a number of countries in their history. It currently remains a legal punishment in several countries and regions, most of which have [[sharia]]–based criminal laws except for [[LGBT rights in Uganda|Uganda]]. 

Gay people also face extrajudicial killings by state and non-state actors in some states and regions of the world. Locations where this is known to occur include: [[LGBT rights in Iraq|Iraq]], [[LGBT rights in Libya|Libya]], [[LGBT rights in Syria|Syria]], and [[Anti-gay purges in Chechnya|Chechnya]]. Imposition of the death penalty for homosexuality may be classified as [[judicial murder]] of gay people, which has been analyzed as a form of [[genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=DeJong |first1=Christina |last2=Long |first2=Eric |title=Handbook of LGBT Communities, Crime, and Justice |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4614-9188-0 |pages=339–362 |language=en |chapter=The Death Penalty as Genocide: The Persecution of "Homosexuals" in Uganda|date=4 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the countries listed below, no dispute or uncertainty regarding the legal status of capital punishment as a possible penalty for same-sex sexual conduct exists.

* Before the Act was promulgated, there was a draft version, the ''Anti-Homosexuality Bill'' (Bill no. 3 of 2023), that generated international news coverage. Had it passed intact it would have criminalised merely identifying as gay or non-binary, stipulating that "hold[ing] out as a lesbian, gay, transgender, a queer or any other sexual or gender identity that is contrary to the binary categories of male and female" was committing "an offence of homosexuality" and thus liable to the penalty of ten years in prison. This provision, 2(1)(d), was excluded from the Act that was passed and signed into law.

===Legality unclear===
According to the ILGA, there are five UN-member countries where the status of the death penalty as a punishment for same-sex sexual conduct is uncertain. This may be because experts or legal scholars dispute the effect of legal provisions, or because the laws relied upon to potentially sanction the death penalty are the {{transl|ar|zina}} provisions which relate to all sexual behaviours outside marriage, with applicability to homosexual relations uncertain, and so far, only theoretical.&lt;ref name="ilga 2020" /&gt;{{rp|25}}

=== Germany ===
{{main|Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany#Death penalty}}
During the period of [[Nazi Germany]] from 1933 to 1945, homosexual men were persecuted with thousands being imprisoned in [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] (and eventually [[extermination camp]]s) by the Nazi regime. Roughly 5,000–15,000 were sent to the concentration camps, with the death rate being estimated to be as high as 60%. Homosexuals in the camps suffered an unusual degree of cruelty by their captors, including being used as target practice on shooting ranges.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Racial State: Germany, 1933–1945|last=Burleigh|first=Michael|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Wippermann, Wolfgang, Mazal Holocaust Collection |isbn=0521391148 |location=Cambridge |oclc=22597244|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/racialstate00mich}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Giles|first=Geoffrey J|title=Social Outsiders in Nazi Germany|date=2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pink Triangle: The Nazi War Against Homosexuals|last=Plant|first=Richard|date=2013|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|isbn=9781429936934|location=New York|oclc=872608428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1937 speech, Himmler argued that SS men who had served sentences for homosexuality should be transferred to a concentration camp and [[Postenpflicht|shot when trying to escape]]. This policy was never implemented, and some SS men were acquitted on homosexuality charges despite evidence against them.{{sfn|Giles|2010|p=393}}  A few death sentences against SS men for homosexual acts were pronounced between 1937 and 1940.{{sfn|Lorenz|2018|p=15}} In a speech on 18 August 1941, Hitler argued that homosexuality should be combatted throughout Nazi organizations and the military. In particular, homosexuality in the [[Hitler Youth]] must be punished by death in order to protect youth from being turned into homosexuals, however the Hitler Youth never implemented this policy.{{sfn|Giles|2010|pp=393–394}}

After learning of Hitler's remark, Himmler decided that the SS must be at least as tough on homosexuality and drafted a decree mandating the death penalty to any member of the SS and police found guilty of engaging in a homosexual act. Hitler signed the decree on 15 November 1941 on the condition that there be absolutely no publicity, worried that such a harsh decree might lend fuel to left-wing propaganda that homosexuality was especially prevalent in Germany. Since it could not be published in the SS newspaper, the decree was communicated to SS men one-on-one by their superiors. However, this was not done consistently and many arrested men asserted that they had no knowledge of the decree.{{sfn|Giles|2010|pp=393–394}} 

Even after the decree, only a few death sentences were pronounced.{{sfn|Giles|2010|p=394}}{{sfn|Longerich|2011|p=239}} Himmler often commuted the sentence especially if he thought that the accused was not a committed homosexual, but had suffered a one-time mistake (particularly while drunk). Many of those whose sentence was commuted were sent to serve in the [[Dirlewanger Brigade]], a penal unit on the Eastern Front, where most were killed.{{sfn|Giles|2010|p=394}} After late 1943, because of military losses, it was the policy to recycle SS men convicted of homosexuality into the Wehrmacht.{{sfn|Schlagdenhauffen|2018|p=33}}

The 1933 law on habitual criminals also allowed for execution after the third conviction.{{sfn|Lorenz|2018|pp=12–13}} On 4 September 1941 a new law allowed the execution of dangerous sex offenders or habitual criminals when "the protection of the ''Volksgemeinschaft'' or the need for just atonement require it". This law enabled authorities to pronounce death sentences against homosexuals, and is known to have been employed in four cases in Austria.{{sfn|Scheck|2020|p=422}}{{sfn|Lorenz|2018|p=13}}  In 1943, [[Wilhelm Keitel]], head of the {{Lang|de|[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]|italic=no}}, authorized the death penalty for soldiers convicted of homosexuality in "particularly serious cases".{{sfn|Storkmann|2021|p=28}}{{sfn|Lorenz|2018|pp=14, 16}} Only a few executions of homosexual Wehrmacht soldiers are known, mostly in conjunction with other charges, especially [[desertion]].{{sfn|Storkmann|2021|p=28}} Some homosexuals were executed at Nazi euthanasia centers, such as [[Bernburg Euthanasia Centre|Bernburg]] or Meseritz-Obrawalde. It is difficult to estimate the number of homosexuals directly killed during the Nazi era.{{sfn|Lorenz|2018|p=11}}

From 1533, under the [[Buggery Act 1533]], capital felony for any person to "commit the detestable and abominable vice of buggery with mankind or beast", was enacted, repealed and re-enacted several times by [[the Crown]], until it was reinstated permanently in 1563. Homosexual activity remained a capital offence until 1861.&lt;ref name="Colonial"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1061&amp;context=englishfacpubs|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|volume=1|issue=3|date=1976|title=Homosexuals and the Death Penalty in Colonial America|first=Louis|last=Crompton|access-date=20 May 2016|doi=10.1300/j082v01n03_03|pages=277–293|pmid=798008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last execution took place on 27 November 1835 when [[James Pratt and John Smith]] were hanged outside [[Newgate Prison]] in London.

{{See also|Sodomy laws in the United States}}
During the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial era]] of [[History of the United States|American history]], the various European nations which [[European colonization of the Americas|established colonies]] in the Americas brought their pre-existing laws against homosexuality (which included capital punishment) with them. The establishment of the United States after their victory in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] did not bring about any changes in the status of capital punishment as a sentence for being convicted of homosexual behavior. Beginning in the 19th century, the various state legislatures passed legislation which ended the status of capital punishment being used for those who were convicted of homosexual behavior. [[South Carolina]] was the last state, in 1873, to repeal the death penalty for homosexual behaviour from its statute books. The number of times the penalty was carried out is unknown. Records show there were at least two executions, and a number of more convictions with vague labels, such as "crimes against nature".&lt;ref name="Colonial" /&gt;

=== Sudan ===
In July 2020, the sodomy law that previously punished gay men with up to 100 lashes for the first offence, five years in jail for the second and the death penalty the third time around was abolished, with new legislation reducing the penalty to prison terms ranging from five years to life. Sudanese LGBT+ activists hailed the reform as a 'great first step', but said it was not enough yet, and the end goal should be the decriminalisation of same-sex sexual activity altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-lgbt-rights-trfn/great-first-step-as-sudan-lifts-death-penalty-and-flogging-for-gay-sex-idUSKCN24H30J |title='Great first step' as Sudan lifts death penalty and flogging for gay sex |author1=Ban Barkawi|author2=Rachel Savage |work=[[Reuters]] |date=16 July 2020 |access-date=17 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
{{notelist|refs=
{{efn|name="article 354"|text=A separate provision of the penal code, Article 354 of the Federal Penal Code of the United Arab Emirates the death sentence is prescribed for certain sexual acts; it states: "shall be sentenced to the death penalty, whoever used coercion in having sexual intercourse with a female or sodomy with a male." There is no certain legal interpretation of this provision,&lt;ref name="WP"/&gt; but, according to [[Amnesty International]] it relates solely to rape ("Amnesty International{{nbsp}}... considers this article to address rape"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |editor=((Amnesty International)) |title=Love, hate and the law: decriminalizing homosexuality |chapter=Appendix 1: The Application of the Death Penalty for Consensual Same-sex Sexual Relations |pages=46–49 |date=4 July 2008|id=Index Number: POL 30/003/2008|chapter-url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/pol30/003/2008/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; or is at least only applied to sexual violence, according to the ILGA ("... it appears that the law is used in rape cases"), not consensual same-sex sexual activity.&lt;ref name="ilga 2020"/&gt;}}
{{efn|name="trust since 2015"|1=The Human Dignity Trust noted in 2020 that all annual human rights reports from the U.S. Department of State on UAE after 2015 stated no prosecutions for same-sex sexual acts had been reported.}}
{{efn|name="legal uncertainty"|text=The ILGA, in its 2020 report and its 2023 database, note that there five UN-member countries where the status of the death penalty as a punishment for same-sex sexual conduct is uncertain. This may be because legal experts or scholars dispute the effect of legal provisions, or because the laws relied upon to potentially sanction the death penalty relate to sexual behaviours outside marriage, with applicability to homosexual relations so far only theoretical. The jurisdictions in this category are: Afghanistan, Pakistan, Qatar, Somalia (including Somaliland) and the United Arab Emirates.|2=&lt;ref name="ilga 2020" /&gt;{{rp|25}}}}
