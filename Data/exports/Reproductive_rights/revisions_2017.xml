'''Reproductive rights''' are [[legal right]]s and freedoms relating to [[human reproduction|reproduction]] and [[reproductive health]] that vary amongst countries around the world.&lt;ref name="COOK"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2950752 |jstor=2950752 |title=Advancing Reproductive Rights Beyond Cairo and Beijing |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=115–21 |year=1996 |last1=Cook |first1=Rebecca J. |last2=Fathalla |first2=Mahmoud F. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] defines reproductive rights as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Reproductive rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. They also include the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of [[discrimination]], [[coercion]] and [[violence]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://who.int/reproductive-health/gender/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726150133/http://www.who.int//reproductive-health/gender/index.html |archivedate=2009-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Women's reproductive rights may include some or all of the following: the right to legal and safe [[abortion]]; the right to [[birth control]]; freedom from [[compulsory sterilization|coerced sterilization]] and contraception; the right to access good-quality [[reproductive health]]care; and the right to [[family planning|education and access]] in order to make free and informed reproductive choices.&lt;ref name="AMNESTY"/&gt; Reproductive rights may also include the right to receive [[sex education|education]] about [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] and other aspects of sexuality, and protection from practices such as [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM).&lt;ref name="COOK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AMNESTY"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nocirc.org/symposia/fourth/zavales4.html|title=Template|website=Nocirc.org|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive rights began to develop as a subset of [[human rights]] at the United Nation's 1968 International Conference on Human Rights.&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN" /&gt; The resulting [[Non-binding resolution|non binding]] Proclamation of Teheran was the first international document to recognize one of these rights when it stated that: "Parents have a basic human right to determine [[Political freedom|freely]] and [[Moral responsibility|responsibly]] the number and the spacing of their children."&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2939211 |pmid=8475521 |jstor=2939211 |title=Human Rights and Reproductive Choice |journal=Studies in Family Planning |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=18–30 |year=1993 |last1=Freedman |first1=Lynn P. |last2=Isaacs |first2=Stephen L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=teheran_proc&gt;{{cite web |title=Proclamation of Teheran|publisher=International Conference on Human Rights|year= 1968|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/b_tehern.htm|accessdate=2007-11-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071017025912/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/b_tehern.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; States, though, have been slow in incorporating these rights in [[treaty|internationally legally binding instruments]]. Thus, while some of these rights have already been recognized in [[soft law|hard law]], that is, in legally binding [[international human rights instruments]], others have been mentioned only in non binding recommendations and, therefore, have at best the status of [[soft law]] in [[international law]], while a further group is yet to be accepted by the international community and therefore remains at the level of [[advocacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Center for Reproductive Rights, International Legal Program, [http://thomas.loc.gov  Establishing International Reproductive Rights Norms: Theory for Change], US CONG. REC. 108th CONG. 1 Sess. E2534 E2547 (Rep. Smith) (Dec. 8, 2003):&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have been leaders in bringing arguments for a woman's right to choose abortion within the rubric of international human rights. However, there is no binding hard norm that recognizes women's right to terminate a pregnancy. (...) While there are hard norms prohibiting sex discrimination that apply to girl adolescents, these are problematic since they must be applied to a substantive right (i.e., the right to health) and the substantive reproductive rights of adolescents are not `hard' (yet!). There are no hard norms on age discrimination that would protect adolescents' ability to exercise their rights to reproductive health, sexual education, or reproductive decisionmaking. In addition, there are no hard norms prohibiting discrimination based on marital status, which is often an issue with respect to unmarried adolescents' access to reproductive health services and information. The soft norms support the idea that the hard norms apply to adolescents under 18. They also fill in the substantive gaps in the hard norms with respect to reproductive health services and information as well as adolescents' reproductive autonomy. (...) There are no hard norms in international human rights law that directly address HIV/AIDS directly. At the same time, a number of human rights bodies have developed soft norms to secure rights that are rendered vulnerable by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. (...) Practices with implications for women's reproductive rights in relation to HIV/AIDS are still not fully covered under existing international law, although soft norms have addressed them to some extent. (...) There is a lack of explicit prohibition of mandatory testing of HIV-positive pregnant women under international law. (...) None of the global human rights treaties explicitly prohibit child marriage and no treaty prescribes an appropriate minimum age for marriage. The onus of specifying a minimum age at marriage rests with the states' parties to these treaties. (...) We have to rely extensively on soft norms that have evolved from the TMBs and that are contained in conference documents to assert that child marriage is a violation of fundamental human rights.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues related to reproductive rights are some of the most vigorously contested rights' issues worldwide, regardless of the population's [[socioeconomic]] level, [[religion]] or [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |isbn=0-8265-1528-2 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of reproductive rights is frequently presented as being of vital importance in discussions and articles by [[List of population concern organizations|population concern organizations]] such as [[Population Matters]].&lt;ref name=popsearch&gt;{{cite web|title=Population Matters search on "reproductive rights"|url=http://populationmatters.org/search_results.php?q=%22reproductive+rights%22|website=Populationmatters.org/|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive rights are a subset of [[sexual and reproductive health and rights]].

==History==
===Proclamation of Teheran===
In 1945, the [[United Nations Charter]] included the obligation "to promote... universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination as to race, sex, language, or religion". However, the Charter did not define these rights. Three years later, the [[United Nations|UN]] adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), the first international legal document to delineate [[human rights]]; the UDHR does not mention reproductive rights.  Reproductive rights began to appear as a subset of human rights in the 1968 Proclamation of Teheran, which states: "Parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and the spacing of their children".&lt;ref name=teheran_proc /&gt;

This right was affirmed by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] in the 1969 [[Declaration on Social Progress and Development]] which states "The family as a basic unit of society and the natural environment for the growth and well-being of all its members, particularly children and youth, should be assisted and protected so that it may fully assume its responsibilities within the community. Parents have the exclusive right to determine freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children."&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/m_progre.htm|title=unhchr.ch|website=Unhchr.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Women's Year#International|1975 UN International Women's Year Conference]] echoed the Proclamation of Teheran.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

===Cairo Programme of Action===
The twenty-year "Cairo Programme of Action" was adopted in 1994 at the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD) in [[Cairo]]. The [[Non-binding resolution|non-binding]] Programme of Action asserted that governments have a responsibility to meet individuals' reproductive needs, rather than demographic targets. It recommended that [[family planning]] services be provided in the context of other reproductive health services, including services for healthy and safe childbirth, care for sexually transmitted infections, and post-abortion care. The ICPD also addressed issues such as [[violence against women]], [[sex trafficking]], and adolescent health.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 5–6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |isbn=0-8265-1528-2 |pages=5–6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cairo Program is the first international policy document to define [[reproductive health]],&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 5–6"/&gt; stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Reproductive health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and its functions and processes. Reproductive health therefore implies that people are able to have a satisfying and safe sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so. Implicit in this last condition are the right of men and women to be informed [about] and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of family planning of their choice, as well as other methods for regulation of fertility which are not against the law, and the right of access to appropriate health-care services that will enable women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth and provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant [para. 72].&lt;ref name="COOK"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unlike previous population conferences, a wide range of interests from grassroots to government level were represented in Cairo. 179 nations attended the ICPD and overall eleven thousand representatives from governments, [[non-governmental organization|NGOs]], international agencies and citizen activists participated.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 5–6"/&gt; The ICPD did not address the far-reaching implications of the [[Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS|HIV/AIDS epidemic]]. In 1999, recommendations at the ICPD+5 were expanded to include commitment to AIDS education, research, and prevention of mother-to-child transmission, as well as to the development of vaccines and microbicides.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 7"&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=0-8265-1528-2 |page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cairo Programme of Action was adopted by 184 UN member states. Nevertheless, many Latin American and Islamic states made [[Reservation (law)|formal reservations]] to the programme, in particular, to its concept of reproductive rights and sexual freedom, to its treatment of abortion, and to its potential incompatibility with [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/popin/icpd/conference/offeng/poa.html|title=A/CONF.171/13: Report of the ICPD (94/10/18) (385k)|website=Un.org|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beijing Platform===
The 1995 [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in Beijing, in its [[non-binding resolution|non-binding]] [[Beijing Declaration|Declaration]] and [[Beijing Platform for Action|Platform for Action]], supported the Cairo Programme's definition of reproductive health, but established a broader context of reproductive rights:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The human rights of women include their right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. Equal relationships between women and men in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for the integrity of the person, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behavior and its consequences [para. 96].&lt;ref name="COOK"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The Beijing Platform demarcated twelve interrelated critical areas of the human rights of women that require advocacy. The Platform framed women's reproductive rights as "indivisible, universal and inalienable human rights."&lt;ref name="BUNCH"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/495143 |jstor=3175048 |title=Beijing '95: Moving Women's Human Rights from Margin to Center |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |volume=22 |pages=200–4 |year=1996 |last1=Bunch |first1=Charlotte |last2=Fried |first2=Susana }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to reproductive health, Principle 9 on "The Right to Treatment with Humanity while in Detention" requires that "States shall... &lt;nowiki&gt;[p]rovide&lt;/nowiki&gt; adequate access to medical care and counseling appropriate to the needs of those in custody, recognizing any particular needs of persons on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity, including with regard to reproductive health, access to [[HIV/AIDS]] information and therapy and access to [[hormone therapy|hormonal]] or other therapy as well as to [[sex reassignment therapy|gender-reassignment treatments]] where desired."&lt;ref&gt;"The Yogyakarta Principles" Preamble and Principle 9. The Rights to Treatment with Humanity While in Detention&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, African, Caribbean and Islamic Countries, as well as the [[Russian Federation]], have objected to the use of these principles as Human Rights standards.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly, Official Records, Third Committee, [http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N09/576/53/PDF/N0957653.pdf?OpenElement Summary record of the 29th meeting held in New York, on Monday, 25 October 2010, at 3 p.m]. For instance, [[Malawi]], speaking on behalf of all African States, argued that the Yogyakarta Principles were "controversial and unrecognized," while the representative of the Russian Federation said that they "had not been agreed to at the intergovernmental level, and which therefore could not be considered as authoritative expressions of the opinion of the international community" (para. 9, 23).&lt;/ref&gt;

===State abuses===
State abuses against reproductive rights have happened both under right-wing and left-wing governments. Such abuses include attempts to forcefully increase the birth rate - one of the most notorious [[natalist]] policies of the 20th century was that which occurred in [[communist Romania]] in the period of 1967-1990 during communist leader [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], who adopted a very aggressive natalist policy which included outlawing abortion and contraception, routine pregnancy tests for women, [[Tax on childlessness|taxes on childlessness]], and legal discrimination against childless people - as well as attempts to decrease the fertility rate - [[China]]'s [[one child policy]] (1978-2015). State mandated [[forced marriage]] was also practiced by authoritarian governments as a way to meet population targets: the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in [[Cambodia]] systematically forced people into marriages, in order to increase the population and continue the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.dccam.org/Abouts/Intern/Natalae_Forced_marriage.pdf |format=PDF|author=Natalae Anderson|title=Memorandum: Charging Forced Marriage as a Crime Against Humanity|date=September 22, 2010|website=D.dccam.org|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some governments have implemented [[eugenic]] policies of [[forced sterilizations]] of 'undesirable' population groups. Such policies were carried out against ethnic minorities in Europe and North America in the 20th century, and more recently in Latin America against the Indigenous population in the 1990s; in [[Peru]], President [[Alberto Fujimori]] (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] as a result of a sterilization program put in place by his administration targeting indigenous people (mainly the [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2148793.stm|title=BBC NEWS - World - Americas - Mass sterilisation scandal shocks Peru|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights==
[[File:Family planning Ethiopia (good effects).JPG|thumbnail|right|Placard showing positive effects of [[family planning]] (Ethiopia)]]
{{see also|Human rights}}
Since most existing legally binding [[international human rights instruments]] do not explicitly mention sexual and reproductive rights, a [[Epistemic community (international relations)|broad coalition]] of NGOs, civil servants, and experts working in [[international organizations]] have been promoting a reinterpretation of those instruments to link the realization of the already internationally recognized human rights with the realization of reproductive rights.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/human-rights-defenders/issues/challenges/srr-defenders Defenders of Sexual and Reproductive Rights]; [http://www.iwhc.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3326&amp;Itemid=548 International Women’s Health Coalition and the United Nations],  [http://www.iwhc.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=205&amp;Itemid=110 Campaign for an Inter-American Convention on Sexual and Reproductive Rights ], Women's Health Collection, [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/_/print/PrintArticle.aspx?id=105915323 Abortion as a human right: possible strategies in unexplored territory. (Sexual Rights and Reproductive Rights),] (2003); and Shanthi Dairiam, [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/_/print/PrintArticle.aspx?id=90988094   Applying the CEDAW Convention for the recognition of women's health rights], Arrows For Change, (2002).  In this regard, the Center for Reproductive Rights has noted that: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Our goal is to ensure that governments worldwide guarantee women's reproductive rights out of an understanding that they are bound to do so. The two principal prerequisites for achieving this goal are: (1) the strengthening of international legal norms protecting reproductive rights; and (2) consistent and effective action on the part of civil society and the international community to enforce these norms. Each of these conditions, in turn, depends upon profound social change at the local, national and international (including regional) levels. (...) Ultimately, we must persuade governments to accept reproductive rights as binding norms. Again, our approach can move forward on several fronts, with interventions both at the national and international levels. Governments' recognition of reproductive rights norms may be indicated by their support for progressive language in international conference documents or by their adoption and implementation of appropriate national-level legislative and policy instruments. In order to counter opposition to an expansion of recognized reproductive rights norms, we have questioned the credibility of such reactionary yet influential international actors as the United States and the Holy See. Our activities to garner support for international protections of reproductive rights include: Lobbying government delegations at UN conferences and producing supporting analyses/materials; fostering alliances with members of civil society who may become influential on their national delegations to the UN; and preparing briefing papers and factsheets exposing the broad anti-woman agenda of our opposition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Center for Reproductive Rights, International Legal Program, [http://thomas.loc.gov  Establishing International Reproductive Rights Norms: Theory for Change], US CONG. REC. 108th CONG. 1 Sess. E2534 E2547 (Rep. Smith) (Dec. 8, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this linkage is provided by the 1994 Cairo Programme of Action: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Reproductive rights embrace certain human rights that are already recognized in national laws, international human rights documents and other relevant United Nations consensus documents. These rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. It also includes the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence as expressed in human rights documents. In the exercise of this right, they should take into account the needs of their living and future children and their responsibilities towards the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iisd.ca/Cairo/program/p07002.html |title=[programme&amp;#93; Basis for action |publisher=Iisd.ca |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Similarly, [[Amnesty International]] has argued that the realisation of reproductive rights is linked with the realisation of a series of recognised [[human rights]], including the [[right to health]], the right to freedom from [[discrimination]], the [[right to privacy]], and the right not to be subjected to torture or ill-treatment.&lt;ref name="AMNESTY"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/Stop_Violence_Against_Women_SVAW/Reproductive_Rights/page.do?id=1108242&amp;n1=3&amp;n2=39&amp;n3=1101 |title=Stop Violence Against Women: Reproductive rights |accessdate=2007-12-08 |author=Amnesty International USA |year=2007 |work=SVAW |publisher=Amnesty International USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120140923/http://www.amnestyusa.org/Stop_Violence_Against_Women_SVAW/Reproductive_Rights/page.do?id=1108242&amp;n1=3&amp;n2=39&amp;n3=1101 |archivedate=2008-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all states have accepted the inclusion of reproductive rights in the body of internationally recognized human rights. At the Cairo Conference, several states made [[Reservation (law)|formal reservations]] either to the concept of reproductive rights or to its specific content.  [[Ecuador]], for instance, stated that: &lt;blockquote&gt;
With regard to the Programme of Action of the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development and in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and laws of Ecuador and the norms of international law, the delegation of Ecuador reaffirms, inter alia, the following principles embodied in its Constitution:  the inviolability of life, the protection of children from the moment of conception, freedom of conscience and religion, the protection of the family as the fundamental unit of society, responsible paternity, the right of parents to bring up their children and the formulation of population and development plans by the Government in accordance with the principles of respect for sovereignty. Accordingly, the delegation of Ecuador enters a reservation with respect to all terms such as "regulation of fertility", "interruption of pregnancy", "reproductive health", "reproductive rights" and "unwanted children", which in one way or another, within the context of the Programme of Action, could involve abortion.&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Similar reservations were made by [[Argentina]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Malta]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]] and the [[Holy See]]. Islamic Countries, such as [[Brunei]], [[Djibouti]], [[Iran]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Libya]], [[Syria]], [[United Arab Emirates]], and [[Yemen]] made broad reservations against any element of the programme that could be interpreted as contrary to the [[Sharia]]. Guatemala even questioned whether the conference could legally proclaim new human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/popin/icpd/conference/offeng/poa.html United Nations, Report of the Fourth International Conference on Population and Development, Cario, 5 - 13 September 1994]. Guatemala entered the following reservation:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chapter VII:  we enter a reservation on the whole chapter, for the General Assembly's mandate to the Conference does not extend to the creation or formulation of rights; this reservation therefore applies to all references in the document to "reproductive rights", "sexual rights", "reproductive health", "fertility regulation", "sexual health", "individuals", "sexual education and services for minors", "abortion in all its forms", "distribution of contraceptives" and "safe motherhood"&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's rights==
{{see also|Women’s rights|Reproductive justice}}
{{Feminism sidebar}}
The [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) advocate for reproductive rights with a primary emphasis on [[women's rights]]. In this respect the UN and WHO focus on a range of issues from access to [[family planning]] services, sex education, [[menopause]], and the reduction of [[obstetric fistula]], to the relationship between reproductive health and economic status.

The reproductive rights of women are advanced in the context of the right to freedom from [[discrimination]] and the social and economic status of women. The group Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era (DAWN) explained the link in the following statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Control over reproduction is a basic need and a basic right for all women. Linked as it is to women's health and social status, as well as the powerful social structures of religion, state control and administrative inertia, and private profit, it is from the perspective of poor women that this right can best be understood and affirmed. Women know that childbearing is a social, not a purely personal, phenomenon; nor do we deny that world population trends are likely to exert considerable pressure on resources and institutions by the end of this century. But our bodies have become a pawn in the struggles among states, religions, male heads of households, and private corporations. Programs that do not take the interests of women into account are unlikely to succeed...&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Women's reproductive rights have long retained key issue status in the debate on [[overpopulation]].&lt;ref name=popsearch/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The only ray of hope I can see – and it's not much – is that wherever women are put in control of their lives, both politically and socially; where medical facilities allow them to deal with birth control and where their husbands allow them to make those decisions, birth rate falls.

Attempts have been made to analyse the socioeconomic conditions that affect the realisation of a woman's reproductive rights. The term [[reproductive justice]] has been used to describe these broader social and economic issues.

{{Masculism sidebar}}
Men's reproductive rights have been claimed by various organizations, both for issues of reproductive health, and other rights related to sexual reproduction.

Three international issues in men's reproductive health are [[sexually transmitted disease]]s, cancer and exposure to [[toxins]].&lt;ref name = "NETWORK"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.fhi.org/en/RH/Pubs/Network/v18_3/NW183ch2.htm |title=Men's Reproductive Health Risks: Threats to men's fertility and reproductive health include disease, cancer and exposure to toxins |accessdate=2008-01-02 |last1=Best |first1=Kim |date=Spring 1998 |journal=Network |pages=7–10 |publisher=Family Health International }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently men's reproductive right with regards to paternity have become subject of debate in the U.S.  The term "[[male abortion]]" was coined by Melanie McCulley, a South Carolina attorney, in a 1998 article.  The theory begins with the premise that when a woman becomes pregnant she has the option of abortion, adoption, or parenthood; it argues, in the context of legally recognized [[gender equality]], that in the earliest stages of pregnancy the putative (alleged) father should have the right to relinquish all future parental rights and financial responsibility, leaving the informed mother with the same three options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McCulley Melanie G | year = 1998 | title = The male abortion: the putative father's right to terminate his interests in and obligations to the unborn child | url = | journal = The Journal of Law and Policy | volume = VII | issue =1 | pages =1–55 |pmid=12666677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been supported by a former president of the feminist organization [[National Organization for Women]], attorney [[Karen DeCrow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/life/feature/2000/10/19/mens_choice|title=A man's right to choose|last1=Young|first1=Kathy|date=Oct 19, 2000|publisher=Salon.com|accessdate= May 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[feminist]] argument for male reproductive choice contends that the uneven ability to choose experienced by men and women in regards to parenthood is evidence of a state-enforced [[coercion]] favoring traditional [[sex roles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Lisa Lucile |last1=Owens |year=2013 |title=Coerced Parenthood as Family Policy: Feminism, the Moral Agency of Women, and Men's 'Right to Choose' |journal=Alabama Civil Rights &amp; Civil Liberties Law Review |volume=5 |pages=1–33 |ssrn=2439294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the National Center for Men brought a case in the US, ''[[Dubay v. Wells]]'' (dubbed by some "''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' for men"), that argued that in the event of an unplanned pregnancy, when an unmarried woman informs a man that she is pregnant by him, he should have an opportunity to give up all paternity rights and responsibilities.  Supporters argue that this would allow the woman time to make an informed decision and give men the same reproductive rights as women.&lt;ref&gt;Traister, Rebecca. (March 13, 2006).

==Intersex and reproductive rights ==
{{see also|Intersex}}
Intersex, in [[human]]s and other [[animal]]s, is a variation in [[sex]] characteristics including [[chromosome]]s, [[gonad]]s, or [[genital]]s that do not allow an individual to be distinctly identified as male or female. Such variation may involve genital ambiguity, and combinations of chromosomal [[genotype]] and sexual [[phenotype]] other than XY-male and XX-female.&lt;ref name="Money"&gt;{{cite book|last=Money |first=John |author2=Ehrhardt, Anke A. |title=Man &amp; Woman Boy &amp; Girl.

UN agencies have begun to take note. On 1 February 2013, Juan E Mendés, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, issued a statement condemning non-consensual surgical intervention on intersex people. His report stated, "Children who are born with atypical sex characteristics are often subject to irreversible sex assignment, involuntary sterilization, involuntary genital normalizing surgery, performed without their informed consent, or that of their parents, "in an attempt to fix their sex", leaving them with permanent, irreversible infertility and causing severe mental suffering".&lt;ref name="untorture"&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A.HRC.22.53_English.pdf Report of the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture], [[Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]], February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, the [[World Health Organization]] issued a joint statement on ''Eliminating forced, coercive and otherwise involuntary sterilization, An interagency statement'' with the [[OHCHR]], [[UN Women]], [[UNAIDS]], [[UNDP]], [[UNFPA]] and [[UNICEF]].

===Minors===
{{See|Parental consent}}
In many jurisdictions minors require parental consent or parental notification in order to access various reproductive services, such as contraception, abortion, gynecological consultations,  testing for STDs etc. The requirement that minors have parental consent/notification for testing for [[HIV/AIDS]] is especially controversial, particularly in areas where the disease is endemic, and it is a sensitive subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/adolescent/hiv-testing-treatment/page/Informed_consent_and_HIV_testing|title=World Health Organization - HIV and Adolescents from Guidance to Action|first=World Health|last=Organization|website=apps.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/696753/doh-backs-bill-allowing-minor-to-get-hiv-aids-tests-without-parental-consent|title=DOH backs bill allowing minor to get HIV, AIDS tests without parental consent|first=Jocelyn R.|last=Uy|website=Newsinfo.inquirer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2014/july/20140723_youth|title=Challenging parental consent laws to increase young people’s access to vital HIV services - UNAIDS|website=Unaids.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balancing minors' rights versus parental rights is considered an [[ethical]] problem in medicine and law, and there have been many court cases on this issue in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/456472_6|title=Medscape Log In|website=Medscape.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important concept recognized since 1989 by the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] is that of the [[evolving capacities|
evolving capacities of a minor]], namely that minors should, in accordance with their maturity and level of understanding, be involved in decisions that affect them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ippfwhr.org/sites/default/files/srrightsyoungen.pdf|title=Sexual and Reproductive Rights of Young People: Autonomous decision making and confidential services|work=International Planned Parenthood Federation|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Youth]] are often denied equal access to reproductive health services because [[health workers]] view adolescent sexual activity as unacceptable,&lt;ref name=Mugisha&gt;{{cite book |last=Mugisha|first=Frederick |editor-first=Andy|editor-last=Furlong|title=Handbook of Youth and Young Adulthood |publisher=Routledge |year=2009 |pages=344–352 |chapter=Chapter 42: HIV and AIDS, STIs and sexual health among young people |isbn=978-0-415-44541-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or see sex education as the responsibility of parents.  Providers of reproductive health have little accountability to youth clients, a primary factor in denying youth access to reproductive health care.&lt;ref name=Mugisha /&gt; In many countries, regardless of legislation, minors are denied even the most basic reproductive care, if they are not accompanied by parents: in India, for instance, in 2017, a 17-year-old girl who was rejected by her family due to her pregnancy, was also rejected by hospitals and gave birth in the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/india-chandil-homeless-street-jharkand-medical-centre-a7918611.html|title=Homeless girl in India forced to give birth on street metres away from health centre: She was shivering and unable to lift and cuddle her infant|date=August 29, 2017|first=Andrew|last=Lowry|work=The Independent|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years the lack of reproductive rights for adolescents has been a concern of international organizations, such as [[UNFPA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/resources/adolescent-sexual-and-reproductive-health|title=Adolescent sexual and reproductive health - UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|website=Unfpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandatory involvement of parents in cases where the minor has sufficient maturity to understand their situation is considered by health organization as a violation of minor's rights and detrimental to their heath. The [[World Health Organization]] has criticized parental consent/notification laws:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Discrimination in health care settings takes many forms and is often manifested when an individual or group is denied access to health care services that are otherwise available to others. It can also occur through denial of services that are only needed by certain groups, such as women. Examples include specific individuals or groups being subjected to physical and verbal abuse or violence; involuntary treatment; '''breaches of confidentiality and/or denial of autonomous decision-making, such as the requirement of consent to treatment by parents, spouses or guardians'''; and lack of free and informed consent. [...] Laws and policies must respect the principles of autonomy in health care decision-making; guarantee free and informed consent, privacy and confidentiality; prohibit mandatory HIV testing; prohibit screening procedures that are not of benefit to the individual or the public; and ban involuntary treatment and '''mandatory third-party authorization and notification requirements'''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2017/discrimination-in-health-care/en/|title=Joint United Nations statement on ending discrimination in health care settings — Joint WHO/UN statement|work=World Health Organization|date=June 27, 2017|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to UNICEF: "When dealing with sexual and reproductive health, the obligation 
to inform parents and obtain their consent becomes a significant barrier with consequences for adolescents’ lives and for public health in general."&lt;ref name="UnicefBAJA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/lac/1._DIG._Min_age_of_medical_consent_PDF_BAJA_.pdf|title=Legal minimum ages and the realization of adolescents' rights|website=Unicef|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One specific issue which is seen as a form of hypocrisy of legislators is that of having a higher age of medical consent for the purpose of reproductive and sexual health than the [[age of sexual consent]] - in such cases the law allows youth to engage in sexual activity, but does not allow them to consent to medical procedures that may arise from being sexually active; UNICEF states that "On sexual and reproductive health matters, the minimum age of medical consent should never be higher than the age of sexual consent."&lt;ref name="UnicefBAJA" /&gt;

[[File:No Sex Signage in Ghana.jpg|thumb|Ad promoting abstinence in [[Ghana]]: ''No Sex Ad'' (Anti-[[HIV/AIDS]] ― [[signage]]). [[Abstinence-only sex education]] is a form of [[sex education]] that teaches [[Sexual abstinence|not having sex]] outside of marriage, most often excluding other types of [[sexual and reproductive health]] education, such as [[birth control]] and [[safe sex]]. [[Comprehensive Sex Education|Comprehensive sex education]], by contrast, covers the use of birth control and sexual abstinence.]]

Many [[unintended pregnancies]] stem from traditional contraceptive methods or no [[contraceptive]] measures.&lt;ref name=Lukale&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lukale|first=Nelly|title=Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights for Young People in Africa|journal=ARROWs for Change|year=2012|volume=18|issue=2|pages=7–8|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Youth sexual education in Uganda is relatively low.  [[Comprehensive sex education]] is not generally taught in schools; even if it was, the majority of young people do not stay in school after the age of fifteen, so information would be limited regardless.&lt;ref name=Knudson&gt;{{cite book|last=Knudson|first=Lara|title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context: South Africa, Uganda, Peru, Denmark, United States, Vietnam, Jordan|year=2006|publisher=Vanderbilt University Press|location=Nashville, TN}}{{page needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Ian Mackenzie High School Classroom.jpg|thumb|alt=A classroom in South Africa, taken from the Wiki Commons.|A classroom in [[South Africa]].]]

[[Africa]] experiences high rates of unintended pregnancy, along with high rates of [[HIV/AIDS]].  Young women aged 15–24 are eight times more likely to have HIV/AIDS than young men. [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] is the world region most affected by HIV/AIDS, with approximately 25 million people living with HIV in 2015. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for two-thirds of the global total of new HIV infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/hivaids|title=HIV/AIDS Factsheet|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempted [[abortions]] and [[unsafe abortions]] are a risk for youth in Africa.  On average, there are 2.4 million unsafe abortions in East Africa, 1.8 million in Western Africa, over 900,000 in Middle Africa, and over 100,000 in Southern Africa each year.&lt;ref name=Lukale /&gt;

In [[Uganda]], abortion is illegal except to save the mother's life.  However, 78% of teenagers report knowing someone who has had an abortion and the police do not always prosecute everyone who has an abortion.  An estimated 22% of all [[maternal deaths]] in the area stem from illegal, unsafe abortions.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;

===European Union===
Over 85% of European women (all ages) have used some form of [[birth control]] in their lives.&lt;ref name=Irala /&gt;  Europeans as an aggregate report using [[Oral contraceptive pill|the pill]] and [[condoms]] as the most commonly used contraceptives.&lt;ref name=Irala&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2011.04.004 |pmid=22078183 |title=Choice of birth control methods among European women and the role of partners and providers |journal=Contraception |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages=558–64 |year=2011 |last1=De Irala |first1=Jokin |last2=Osorio |first2=Alfonso |last3=Carlos |first3=Silvia |last4=Lopez-Del Burgo |first4=Cristina }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Views on sexual practice vary throughout the region.  For example, in the [[United Kingdom]] (UK), sex among youth is generally looked down upon and seen as a problem in need of solution.  In the [[Netherlands]], sex between youth is viewed as normal and therefore not discussed in terms of solutions, but rather in terms of ensuring safe practices.  That being said, the UK tends to focus on stopping sexual behavior, while the Netherlands focuses on building self-esteem and healthy relationships.&lt;ref name=Ketting /&gt;

===Latin America===
{{Main|Reproductive rights in Latin America}}
[[Latin America]] has come to international attention due to its harsh anti-abortion laws. Latin America is home to some of the few countries of the world with a complete ban on abortion, without an exception for saving [[maternal mortality|maternal life]].&lt;ref name="ChileCourt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-41005517|title=Chile abortion: Court approves easing total ban|date=August 21, 2017|work=BBC|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some of these countries, particularity in [[Central America]], the enforcement of such laws is very aggressive: [[Abortion in El Salvador|El Salvador]] and [[Abortion in Nicaragua|Nicaragua]] have drawn international attention for strong enforcement of their complete bans on abortion. In 2017, [[Abortion in Chile|Chile]] relaxed its total ban, allowing abortion to be performed when the woman’s life is in danger, when a fetus is unviable, or in cases of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/chile-the-long-road-to-abortion-reform-a7917791.html|title=Chile: the long road to abortion reform — After a fierce debate, one of the most restrictive reproductive laws in the world has been eased|date=August 29, 2017|first=Cordelia|last=Freeman |work=The Independent|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ecuador]], education and class play a large role in the definition of which young women become pregnant and which do not - 50% of young women who are illiterate get pregnant, compared to 11% of girls with secondary education.  The same is true for poorer individuals - 28% become impregnated while only 11% of young women in wealthier households do.  Furthermore, access to reproductive rights, including contraceptives, are limited, due to age and the perception of female morality.  Health care providers often discuss contraception theoretically, not as a device to be used on a regular basis.  Decisions concerning sexual activity often involve secrecy and taboos, as well as a lack of access to accurate information.  Even more telling, young women have much easier access to maternal healthcare than they do to contraceptive help, which helps explain high pregnancy rates in the region.&lt;ref name=Goicolea&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goicolea|first=Isabel|title=Adolescent Pregnancies in the Amazon Basin of Ecuador: A Rights and Gender Approach to Adolescents' Sexual and Reproductive Health|journal=Global Health Action|year=2010|volume=3|pages=1–11|doi=10.3402/gha.v3i0.5280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jordan]], there is essentially no sex education in the school system; even when curriculum includes information about sexual issues, teachers are apt to skim over it, for fear of upsetting parents or being uncomfortable.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;  Youth in the country desire comprehensive, correct, and precise information from healthcare providers, although they rarely report experiencing that.  Many youth equate reproductive health with [[maternal health]], not recognizing the connections to themselves before [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=Khalaf&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khalaf|first=Inaam|author2=Fathieh Abu Moghli |author3=Erika Sivarajan Froelicher |title=Youth Friendly Reproductive Services in Jordan from the Perspective of the Youth: A Descriptive Qualitative Study|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences|year=2010|volume=24|issue=2|pages=321–331|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6712.2009.00723.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accessibility and availability of clinics in Jordan vary depending on location.  Some villagers have a hard time making it to clinics, due to the high cost of transportation and the distance that must be covered.  Health care centers are often overcrowded and understaffed, with limited hours of operation.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;  Youth report long wait times and unhygienic conditions at clinics.&lt;ref name=Khalaf /&gt;  Personal experiences with health care workers vary, with some youth feeling as though they received disrespectful and unfair treatment.&lt;ref name=Khalaf /&gt;

===United States===
{{See also|Birth control in the United States}}
Among sexually experienced teenagers, 78% of teenage females and 85% of teenage males used contraception the first time they had sex; 86% and 93% of these same females and males, respectively, reported using contraception the last time they had sex.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet Guttmacher"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet: Contraceptive Use in the United States|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_contr_use.html|publisher=Guttmacher Institute|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The male [[condom]] is the most commonly used method during first sex, although 54% of young women in the United States rely upon the [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|pill]].&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet Guttmacher" /&gt;

Young people in the U.S. are no more sexually active than individuals in other developed countries, but they are significantly less knowledgeable about contraception and safe sex practices.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt; As of 2006, only twenty states required [[sex education]] in schools - of these, only ten required information about contraception.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;  On the whole, less than 10% of American students receive sex education that includes topical coverage of [[abortion]], [[homosexuality]], [[Intimate relationships|relationships]], [[pregnancy]], and STI prevention.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;  [[Abstinence-only education]] was used throughout much of the United States in the 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;  Based upon the moral principle that sex outside of marriage is unacceptable, the programs often misled students about their rights to have sex, the consequences, and prevention of pregnancy and STIs.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;

In 24 states, legislation was passed that required women who were seeking an abortion to have an ultrasound at least 24 hours before it.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Smith, [http://aladinrc.wrlc.org/bitstream/handle/1961/15158/Smith%2c%20Angela%20-%20Spring%202013.pdf?sequence=1 "What Factors Lead to Abortion Restrictions?"], "Washington Research Library Consortium", May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the ultrasound requirement, several states such as Texas have passed legislation requiring facilities that provide abortions to be classified as ambulatory surgery centers, despite the very low rates of abortion complications each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/cola/orgs/txpep/_files/pdf/Grossman,White,Hopkins,Potter-PublicHealthThreatofAnti-abortionLegislation-Contraception-2014.pdf]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319014005/http://www.utexas.edu/cola/orgs/txpep/_files/pdf/Grossman%2CWhite%2CHopkins%2CPotter-PublicHealthThreatofAnti-abortionLegislation-Contraception-2014.pdf |date=2015-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people view this type of legislation as a way to discourage women from getting abortions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2014.07.006 |pmid=25128413 |pmc=4179978 |title=Change in abortion services after implementation of a restrictive law in Texas |journal=Contraception |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=496–501 |year=2014 |last1=Grossman |first1=Daniel |last2=Baum |first2=Sarah |last3=Fuentes |first3=Liza |last4=White |first4=Kari |last5=Hopkins |first5=Kristine |last6=Stevenson |first6=Amanda |last7=Potter |first7=Joseph E. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Supreme Court has struck down Texas’ most recent law that would have reduced the number of facilities able to give abortions to only eight in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/14/supreme-court-texas_n_5986244.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305060244/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/14/supreme-court-texas_n_5986244.html |archivedate=2015-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lack of knowledge about rights==
One of the reasons why reproductive rights are poor in many places, is that the vast majority of the population does not know the what the law is. Not only that ordinary people are uninformed, but so are medical doctors. A study in Brazil on medical doctors found considerable ignorance and misunderstanding of the law on abortion (which is severely restricted, but not completely illegal).&lt;ref&gt;https://reproductive-health-journal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-4755-2-10&lt;/ref&gt; In Ghana, abortion, while restricted, is permitted on several grounds, but only 3% of pregnant women and 6% of those seeking an abortion were aware of the legal status of abortion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/abortion-ghana&lt;/ref&gt; In Nepal, abortion was legalized in 2002, but a study in 2009 found that only half of women knew that abortion was legalized.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipsnews.net/2006/09/nepal-only-half-of-women-know-abortion-is-legal/&lt;/ref&gt; Many people also do not understand the laws on [[sexual violence]]: in Hungary, where [[marital rape]] was made illegal in 1997, in a study in 2006, 62% of people did not know that marital rape was a crime.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110608032444/http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR27/002/2007/en/71da229c-d39d-11dd-a329-2f46302a8cc6/eur270022007en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations Development Programme states that, in order to advance gender justice, "Women must know their rights and be able to access legal systems",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/crisis%20prevention/undp-cpr-8-point-agenda-practical-positive-outcomes-girls-women-crisis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1993 UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women states at Art. 4 (d) [...] "States should also inform women of their rights in seeking redress through such mechanisms".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender equality and violence against women==
{{Further|Gender equality|Violence against women|Sexual violence|Forced marriage|Child marriage}}
Addressing issues of gender-based violence is crucial for attaining reproductive rights. The [[United Nations Population Fund]] refers to "'''''Equality and equity for men and women''', to enable individuals to make free and informed choices in all spheres of life, free from discrimination based on gender''" and "''Sexual and reproductive security, '''including freedom from sexual violence and coercion''', and the right to privacy,''" as part of achieving reproductive rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/rights/rights.htm |title=United Nations Population Fund &amp;#124; Supporting the Constellation of Reproductive Rights |publisher=UNFPA |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and states that the '''right to liberty and security of the person''' which is fundamental to reproductive rights obliges states to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2005/english/ch3/ch3_box9.htm |title=United Nations Population Fund &amp;#124; State of World Population 2005 |publisher=UNFPA |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Take measures to prevent, punish and eradicate all forms of gender-based violence
*Eliminate female genital mutilation/cutting

The WHO states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hhr/activities/GRR/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Gender and Reproductive Rights |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Gender and Reproductive Rights (GRR) aims to promote and protect human rights and gender equality as they relate to sexual and reproductive health by developing strategies and mechanisms for promoting gender equity and equality and human rights in the Departments global and national activities, as well as within the functioning and priority-setting of the Department itself."

Amnesty International writes that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/campaigns/stop-violence-against-women/issues/implementation-existing-laws/srr |title=Sexual and reproductive rights &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date=2007-11-06 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Violence against women violates women's rights to life, physical and mental integrity, to the highest attainable standard of health, to freedom from torture and it violates their sexual and reproductive rights."

One key issue for achieving reproductive rights is criminalization of [[sexual violence]]. If a woman is not protected from forced sexual intercourse, she is not protected from [[forced pregnancy]], namely [[pregnancy from rape]]. In order for a woman to be able to have reproductive rights, she must have the right to choose with whom and when to reproduce; and first of all, decide whether, when, and under what circumstances to be sexually active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/gender_rights/sexual_health/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Gender and human rights |publisher=Who.int |date=2002-01-31 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries, these rights of women are not respected, because women do not have a choice in regard to their partner, with [[forced marriage]] and [[child marriage]] being common in parts of the world; and neither do they have any rights in regard to sexual activity, as many countries do not allow women to refuse to engage in sexual intercourse when they do not want to (because [[marital rape]] is not criminalized in those countries) or to engage in consensual sexual intercourse if they want to (because sex outside marriage is illegal in those countries). In addition to legal barriers, there are also social barriers, because in many countries a complete sexual subordination of a woman to her husband is expected (for instance, in one survey 74% of women in Mali said that a husband is justified to beat his wife if she refuses to have sex with him&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioline.org.br/request?rh04047 |title=Bioline International Official Site (site up-dated regularly) |publisher=Bioline.org.br |date=2015-02-09 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;), while sexual/romantic relations disapproved by family members, or generally sex outside marriage, can result in serious violence, such as [[honor killings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/ |title=Ethics: Honour Crimes |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the CDC, "HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It weakens a person’s immune system by destroying important cells that fight disease and infection. No effective cure exists for HIV. But with proper medical care, HIV can be controlled."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/index.html|title=HIV Basics {{!}} HIV/AIDS {{!}} CDC|website=Cdc.gov|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  HIV amelioration is an important aspect of reproductive rights because the virus can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy or birth, or via breast milk.

The WHO states that: "All women, including those with HIV, have the right “to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children and to have access to the information, education and means to enable them to exercise these rights”".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/87/11/08-059360/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Reproductive choices for women with HIV |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reproductive rights of people living with HIV, and their health, are very important. The link between HIV and reproductive rights exists in regard to four main issues:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
*prevention of unwanted pregnancy
*help to plan wanted pregnancy
*healthcare during and after pregnancy
*access to abortion services

==Child and forced marriage==
{{Main|Child marriage|Forced marriage}}
The WHO states that the reproductive rights and health of girls in child marriages are negatively affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Life-stages/sexual-and-reproductive-health/news/news/2012/12/child-marriage-a-threat-to-health|title=Child marriage – a threat to health|date=20 December 2012|website=www.euro.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[United Nations Population Fund|UNPF]] calls child marriage a "human rights violation" and states that in developing countries, one in every three girls is married before reaching age 18, and one in nine is married under age 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/child-marriage|title=Child marriage - UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|website=www.unfpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[forced marriage]] is a marriage in which one or more of the parties is married without his or her consent or against his or her will.

==Issues==

===Cairo Programme of Action implementation===
Implementation of the Cairo Programme of Action varies considerably from country to country. In many countries, post-ICPD tensions emerged as the [[human rights]]-based approach was implemented. Since the ICPD, many countries have broadened their reproductive health programs and attempted to integrate maternal and child health services with family planning. More attention is paid to adolescent health and the consequences of unsafe abortion. Lara Knudsen observes that the ICPD succeeded in getting [[feminist]] language into governments' and population agencies' literature, but in many countries the underlying concepts are not widely put into practice.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 7"/&gt; In two preparatory meetings for the ICPD+10 in Asia and Latin America, the United States, under the George W. Bush Administration, was the only nation opposing the ICPD's Programme of Action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=0-8265-1528-2 |page=9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abortion===
{{Further|Abortion law}}
According to a study by WHO and the Guttmacher Institute worldwide, 25 million [[unsafe abortion]]s (45% of all abortions) occurred every year between 2010 and 2014. 97% of unsafe abortions occur in developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. By contrast, most abortions that take place in Western and Northern Europe and North America are safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/unsafe-abortions-worldwide/en/|title=Worldwide, an estimated 25 million unsafe abortions occur each year|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] considers the criminalization of abortion a "violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights" and a form of "gender based violence"; paragraph 18 of its ''General recommendation No. 35 on gender based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19'' states that: "Violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights, such as forced sterilizations, forced abortion, forced pregnancy, criminalisation of abortion, denial or delay of  safe  abortion  and  post abortion  care,  forced  continuation  of pregnancy,  abuse  and mistreatment  of  women  and  girls  seeking  sexual  and  reproductive  health  information, goods and services, are forms of [[violence against women|gender based violence]] that, depending on   the circumstances, may amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment."&lt;ref name="tbinternet.ohchr.org"&gt;http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/1_Global/CEDAW_C_GC_35_8267_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The same ''General Recommendation'' also urges countries at paragraph 31 to [...] In particular, repeal:
a) Provisions  that  allow,  tolerate  or  condone  forms  of  gender based  violence against women, including [...] legislation  that  criminalises  abortion".&lt;ref name="tbinternet.ohchr.org"/&gt;

An article from the World Health Organization calls safe, legal abortion a "[[fundamental right]] of women, irrespective of where they live" and [[unsafe abortion]] a "silent [[pandemic]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/unsafe_abortion/ua_paper/en/index.html|title=WHO: Unsafe Abortion - The Preventable Pandemic|accessdate=2010-01-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113104553/http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/unsafe_abortion/ua_paper/en/index.html|archivedate=2010-01-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article states "ending the silent pandemic of unsafe abortion is an urgent [[public health|public-health]] and [[human-rights]] imperative." It also states "access to safe abortion improves [[women’s health]], and vice versa, as documented in [[Romania]] during the regime of President [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]" and "legalisation of abortion on request is a necessary but insufficient step toward improving women’s health" citing that in some countries, such as India where abortion has been legal for decades, access to competent care remains restricted because of other barriers. WHO’s Global Strategy on Reproductive Health, adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2004, noted: “As a preventable cause of maternal mortality and morbidity, unsafe abortion must be dealt with as part of the MDG on improving maternal health and other international development goals and targets." &lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/unsafe_abortion/hrpwork/en/index.html |title=WHO &amp;#124; Preventing unsafe abortion |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO's Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP), whose research concerns people's sexual and reproductive health and lives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hrp/en/ |title=HRP &amp;#124; World Health Organization |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; has an overall strategy to combat unsafe abortion that comprises four inter-related activities:&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;
*to collate, synthesize and generate scientifically sound evidence on unsafe abortion prevalence and practices;
*to develop improved technologies and implement interventions to make abortion safer;
*to translate evidence into norms, tools and guidelines;
*and to assist in the development of programmes and policies that reduce unsafe abortion and improve access to safe abortion and highquality postabortion care

The UN has estimated in 2017 that repealing anti-abortion laws would save the lives of nearly 50,000 women a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=55141|title=UN News - Repealing anti-abortion laws would save the lives of nearly 50,000 women a year – UN experts|first=United Nations News Service|last=Section|date=27 September 2016|website=UN News Service Section}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unsafe abortions take place primarily in countries where abortion is illegal, but also occur in countries where it is legal, but women cannot access it because of various reasons ([[conscientious objector]]s among doctors, high prices, lack of knowledge that abortion is legal). Indeed, there are countries where the law  is liberal, but in practice it is very difficult to have an abortion, due to most doctors being  conscientious objectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/italian-gynaecologists-refuse-abortions-miscarriages|title=Seven in 10 Italian gynaecologists refuse to carry out abortions|first1=Stephanie Kirchgaessner Pamela|last1=Duncan|first2=Alberto|last2=Nardelli|first3=Delphine|last3=Robineau|date=11 March 2016|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/doctors-refusal-to-perform-abortions-divides-croatia-02-13-2017|title=Doctors’ Refusal to Perform Abortions Divides Croatia :: Balkan Insight|website=www.balkaninsight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that is some countries where abortion is legal it is ''[[de facto]]'' very difficult to have access to one is controversial; the UN in its 2017 resolution on ''Intensification of efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls: domestic violence'' urged states to guarantee access to "safe abortion where such services are permitted by national law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/71/170|title=United Nations Official Document|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safe and legal abortion services are often very difficult to access by women from rural areas or from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. In 2008, [[Human Rights Watch]] stated that "In fact, even where abortion is permitted by law, women often have severely limited access to safe abortion services because of lack of proper regulation, health services, or political will" and estimated that "Approximately 13 percent of maternal deaths worldwide are attributable to unsafe abortion—between 68,000 and 78,000 deaths annually."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/women/abortion.html|title=Human Rights Watch: Women's Human Rights: Abortion|website=www.hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When negotiating the Cairo Programme of Action at the 1994 [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD), the issue was so contentious that delegates eventually decided to omit any recommendation to legalize abortion, instead advising governments to provide proper post-abortion care and to invest in programs that will decrease the number of unwanted pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=0-8265-1528-2 |page=6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 2008 the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]], a group comprising members from 47 European countries, adopted a resolution calling for the decriminalization of abortion within reasonable gestational limits and guaranteed access to safe abortion procedures. The nonbinding resolution was passed on April 16 by a vote of 102 to 69.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/media/inthenews/2008/04/18/index.html |title=Council of Europe Urges Member States to Decriminalize Abortion |publisher=Guttmacher.org |date=2008-04-18 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During and after the ICPD, some interested parties attempted to interpret the term ‘reproductive health’ in the sense that it implies abortion as a means of family planning or, indeed, a right to abortion. These interpretations, however, do not reflect the consensus reached at the Conference. 
For the European Union, where legislation on abortion is certainly less restrictive than elsewhere, the Council Presidency has clearly stated that the Council’s commitment to promote ‘reproductive health’ did not include the promotion of abortion.&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament, 4 December 2003: Oral Question (H-0794/03) for Question Time at the part-session in December 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Dana Scallon to the Council. In the written record of that session, one reads: Posselt (PPE-DE): “Does the term ‘reproductive health’ include the promotion of abortion, yes or no?” - Antonione, Council: “No.”&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the European Commission, in response to a question from a Member of the European Parliament, clarified:

''“The term ‘reproductive health’ was defined by the United Nations (UN) in 1994 at the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development. All Member States of the Union endorsed the Programme of Action adopted at Cairo. The Union has never adopted an alternative definition of ‘reproductive health’ to that given in the Programme of Action, '''which makes no reference to abortion'''.”''&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament, 24 October 2002: Question no 86 by Dana Scallon (H-0670/02)&lt;/ref&gt;
  
With regard to the U.S., it should be noted that, only a few days prior to the Cairo Conference, the head of the U.S. delegation, Vice President Al Gore, had stated for the record:
 
''“Let us get a false issue off the table: the US does not seek to establish a new international right to abortion, and we do not believe that abortion should be encouraged as a method of family planning.”''&lt;ref&gt;Jyoti Shankar Singh, Creating a New Consensus on Population (London: Earthscan, 1998), 60&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Some years later, the position of the U.S. Administration in this debate was reconfirmed by U.S. Ambassador to the UN, Ellen Sauerbrey, when she stated at a meeting of the UN Commission on the Status of Women that: ''“nongovernmental organizations are attempting to assert that Beijing  in some way creates or contributes to the creation of an internationally recognized fundamental right to abortion”''.&lt;ref&gt;Lederer, AP/San Francisco Chronicle, 1 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; She added: ''“There is no fundamental right to abortion. And yet it keeps coming up largely driven by NGOs trying to hijack the term and trying to make it into a definition”''.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Reuters, 28 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative research from the [[Institute of Development Studies]] states that "access to safe abortion is a matter of human rights, democracy and public health, and the denial of such access is a major cause of death and impairment, with significant costs to [international] development".&lt;ref name=IDS2009&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121649491/issue | title = Unsafe Abortion: A Development Issue | journal = Institute of Development Studies (IDS) Bulletin | volume = 39 | date = July 2009 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research highlights the inequities of access to safe abortion both globally and nationally and emphasises the importance of global and national movements for reform to address this. The shift by campaigners of reproductive rights from an issue-based agenda (the right to abortion), to safe, legal abortion not only as a human right, but bound up with democratic and citizenship rights, has been an important way of reframing the abortion debate and reproductive justice agenda.&lt;ref name=IDS2009 /&gt;

Meanwhile, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] complicated the question even more through a landmark judgment (case of ''[[A. B. and C. v. Ireland]]''), in which it is stated that the denial of abortion for health and/or well-being reasons is an interference with an individuals right to respect for private and family life under Article 8 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], an interference which in some cases can be justified.

===Population control===
{{see also|Population control}}
Compulsory or forced sterilizations and abortions may also occur in the context of [[population control]] policies.
From the 1970s to 1980s, tension grew between women's health activists who advance women's reproductive rights as part of a [[human rights]]-based approach on the one hand, and population control advocates on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=0-8265-1528-2 |page=2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1984 UN World Population Conference in Mexico City population control policies came under attack from women's health advocates who argued that the policies' narrow focus led to coercion and decreased quality of care, and that these policies ignored the varied social and cultural contexts in which family planning was provided in developing countries. In the 1980s the HIV/AIDS epidemic forced a broader discussion of sex into the public discourse in many countries, leading to more emphasis on reproductive health issues beyond reducing fertility. The growing opposition to the narrow population control focus led to a significant departure in the early 1990s from past population control policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=0-8265-1528-2 |pages=4–5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, abortion opponents have begun to foment [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] about reproductive rights advocates, accusing them of advancing a [[Racism|racist]] agenda of [[eugenics]], and of trying to reduce the [[African American]] birth rate in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Dewan&gt;{{Cite news | last = Dewan | first = Shaila | author-link = | title = To Court Blacks, Foes of Abortion Make Racial Case | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | date = February 26, 2010 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/us/27race.html | accessdate = 7 June 2010 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female genital mutilation===
[[File:FGM_prevalence_UNICEF_2016.svg|thumb|200px|Prevalence of FGM]]
[[Female genital mutilation]] (FGM) is defined as "all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/|title=Female genital mutilation|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure has no health benefits, and can cause severe bleeding and problems urinating, cysts, infections, and complications in childbirth and increased risk of newborn deaths.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; It is performed for traditional, cultural or religious reasons in many parts of the world, especially in Africa. The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] prohibits FGM (Article 38).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://rm.coe.int/168046031c |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531114057/https://rm.coe.int/168046031c |archivedate=2017-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sperm donation===
{{Further|Sperm donation|Sperm donor limitation by country}}
Laws in many countries and states require [[sperm donation|sperm donors]] to be either anonymous or known to the recipient, or the laws restrict the number of children each donor may father. Although many donors choose to remain anonymous, new [[technologies]] such as the Internet and DNA technology have opened up new avenues for those wishing to know more about the biological father, siblings and half-siblings.

===Compulsory sterilization===

{{see also|Chemical castration|Eugenics}}

====Roma women====
{{Further|Roma people}}
During the 20th century, forced sterilization of [[Romani people|Roma]] women in European countries, especially in former Communist countries, was practiced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8375960.stm |title=Czech regret over sterilisation |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-11-24 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popdev.hampshire.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/u4763/DT+71+Albert.pdf|title=PopDev|website=popdev.hampshire.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are allegations that these practices continue unofficially in some countries, such as Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Denysenko |first=Marina |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6409699.stm |title=Europe &amp;#124; Sterilised Roma accuse Czechs |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-03-12 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romea.cz/en/news/czech/kocab-draws-attention-to-the-forced-sterilization-of-romani-women-most-recent-incident-allegedly-took-place-in-2007 |title=Kocáb draws attention to the forced sterilization of Romani women; most recent incident allegedly took place in 2007 |publisher=Romea.cz |date=2009-07-21 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[V. C. vs. Slovakia]], the [[European Court for Human Rights]] ruled in favor of a Roma woman who was the victim of forced sterilization in a state hospital in [[Slovakia]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-107364#{%22itemid%22:%22001-107364%22]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301223751/http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-107364 |date=2014-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
An individual’s sterilization is one of the main issues behind the reproductive rights that are being ignored by those who believe that they have a right to decide whether certain people are "fit" to have children. The mental stability of an individual and the physical defects that an individual might have played an important role in the beginnings of forced sterilization. Individuals were afraid that these defects were hereditary and wanted to put a stop to it before society became incompetent. Although there are numerous operations which may render one sterile, [[vasectomy]] in the male and [[salpingectomy]] in the female are considered the least radical. Neither operation is considered dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oswald|first=Frances|title=Eugenical Sterilization in the United States|journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=July 1930|volume=36|issue=1|pages=65–73|doi=10.1086/215285}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The laws of the states in which sterilization is practiced vary. Numerous provisions have been made both by the United States and by individual states for limiting the number of degenerates in this country. The creation of voluntary programs such as [[Planned Parenthood]] (presented the use of [[abstinence]] and contraceptives as forms of controlling the population growth) were introduced to help families control their birth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dombroff|first=Robert M.|author2=Harris T. Lifshitz |title=Overpopulation: No Strength in Numbers|journal=Family Law Quarterly|year=1972|volume=6|issue=2|pages=93–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sterilization has long been a controversial topic in the United States. Up through the 1970s, states could choose which women were allowed the procedure and which women were not eligible. This strategy proved repressive, both for women who wished to become sterilized and were not granted the right, as well as for women who had no choice but to become sterilized{{who|date=September 2014}}. Then, as today, sterilization was a form of birth control highly sought after by some women. However, until the 1960s, it was illegal for women to become sterilized for reasons other than eugenics, which meant sterilization as birth control was illegal. This left many women with highly legitimate reasons for sterilization unable to receive the procedure. It also meant most women who were undergoing the procedure were getting it for non-birth control reasons and not by choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schoen|first=Johanna|title=Between Choice and Coercion: Women and the Politics of Sterilization in North Carolina, 1929-1975|journal=Journal of Women's History|year=2001|volume=13|issue=1|pages=132–156|doi=10.1353/jowh.2001.0034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, both compulsory and coercive sterilization have become constitutional issues because some argue that it violates an individual’s ‘right to procreate’. In 1972, ''[[Eisenstadt v. Baird]]'' set the precedent: “the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted government intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision to bear or beget a child”. Yet, sterilization is still being used in court sentencing for both men and women in cases involving child abuse and/or neglect, drug abuse, and other criminal activity. The relationship between reproductive rights and sterilization is also visible in hospital settings where doctors have been documented as ordering women, namely low-income women of color, to consent to sterilization or have their birthing services withheld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carey|first=Allison C.|title=Gender and compulsory sterilization programs in America: 1907-1950|journal=Journal of Historical Sociology|year=1998|volume=11|issue=1|pages=74–105|doi=10.1111/1467-6443.00054}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roth|first=Rachel|title=No New Babies-Gender Inequality and Reproductive Control in the Criminal Justice and Prison Systems|journal=Am.

====Canada====
Canada recently took the initiative in assisting women seeking abortions globally, as on Wednesday March 8, 2017, International Women's Day, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $650 million advocacy program.&lt;ref name="Globe30092017"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-announces-650-million-for-sexual-and-reproductive-health/article34237503/|title=Canada spending $650-million on reproductive rights, including fighting global anti-abortion laws|first=Chris|last=Wattie|date=14 April 2017|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move came following the United States of America cutting its budget for reproductive Health and Family Planning in the developing world. Under the previous Obama Government, the United States had pause a policy that withheld funding for abortions and sexual health resources globally.&lt;ref name="CBC02032017"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-abortion-funding-trump-ban-1.4006289|title=Abortion funding: Canada's Liberals will help fill global gap from Trump's ban|first=Mike|last=Blanchfield|date=2 March 2017|work=CBC News|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, under the Trump administration, the policy was reinitiated, as it had been under previous Republican governments.&lt;ref name="CBC02032017" /&gt; The program see’s Canada become a worldwide leader in women’s rights initiatives, as it assists in advocacy for safe, and legal abortions in Nations that currently prohibit them.

Abortion is currently illegal in an estimated 125 nations.&lt;ref name="Globe30092017" /&gt; Trudeau and the Liberal Government of Canada emphasized that this money will assist in developing support groups globally to challenge the legislation within these nations to enforce women’s rights.

According to the Canadian Government the primary focus of the foreign aid strategy is "removing judicial and legal barriers to the fulfillment of sexual and reproductive health and rights".&lt;ref name="Globe30092017" /&gt; The strategy aims to reduce unsafe abortions and educate individuals on contraception and family planning.

The move illustrated a push to assist women globally after a shift in gender lenses has become more prevalent. Advocacy groups have recently rallied to make global standards move inclusive for women in recent years, and the move by the Canadian Government only emphasized this more. International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau emphasized that society needs to "apply a feminist lens", and to advocate for parity amongst genders.&lt;ref name="CBC02032017" /&gt;

However, the implementation of the program holds potential to be heavily criticized globally, as nations such as Africa consist of primarily conservative governments, with heavily religious investment. Christian and Islamic groups heavily influence these governments, and are exceptionally anti-abortion under religious code.&lt;ref name="Globe30092017" /&gt;

Yearly, "21.6 million women experience a unsafe abortion worldwide", with over 18.5 million of these occurring in developing nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/unsafe_abortion/magnitude/en/|title=Sexual and reproductive health: Preventing unsafe abortion|work=World Health Organization|year=2008|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These staggering figures led to many individuals expressing support for the new Canadian Governments plan, stating that "it comes at a critical moment, when the world is seeing the clawing back of hard-won women’s rights in many countries".&lt;ref name="Globe30092017" /&gt;

Prime Minister Trudeau emphasized his personal support with regards to stopping the high mortality rate saying that "Far too many women and girls, unsafe abortions and lack of choices in reproductive health mean that they either are at risk of death or else simply cannot contribute and cannot achieve their full potential”"&lt;ref name="Globe30092017" /&gt;

Internally, Canadian political parties were at odds with the nature of the policy and the allocation of funds from the budget. NDP representative Hélène Laverdière stated that her party is pleased with the initiative, but feel that the amount of money is not enough to have a major impact. Contrarily, Conservative party representative Karen Vecchio, expressed displeasure with the decision, stating that they would rather see the money invested on home soil towards Indigenous women.&lt;ref name="Globe30092017" /&gt;

===Roman Catholic Church===
The [[Catholic Church]] is opposed to artificial contraception, abortion, and [[Premarital sex|sexual intercourse outside marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%2038:8-10&amp;version=NIV|title=Gen 38:8-10 NIV - Then Judah said to Onan, "Sleep with - Bible Gateway|work=Bible Gateway|accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief dates back to the first centuries of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.com/tracts/contraception-and-sterilization|title=Contraception and Sterilization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="therealpresence1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therealpresence.org/archives/Abortion_Euthanasia/Abortion_Euthanasia_004.htm|title=Fr. Hardon Archives - The Catholic Tradition on the Morality of Contraception|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Roman Catholicism is not the only religion with such views, its religious doctrine is very powerful in influencing counties where most of the population is Catholic, and the few countries of the world with complete bans on abortion are Catholic-majority countries,&lt;ref name="ChileCourt" /&gt; and in Europe strict restrictions on abortion exist in the Catholic majority countries of [[Abortion in Malta|Malta]] (complete ban), [[Abortion in the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Abortion in Andorra|Andorra]], [[Abortion in San Marino|San Marino]], [[Abortion in Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]] and to a lesser extent [[Abortion in Poland|Poland]] and [[Abortion in Monaco|Monaco]].

==Criticisms==
Some [[Opposition to the legalization of abortion|opponents of legalized abortion]] view the term "reproductive rights" as a [[euphemism]] to sway emotions in favor of abortion.  [[National Right to Life]] has referred to "reproductive rights" as a "fudge term" and "the code word for ''abortion'' rights."&lt;ref name=NRLC&gt;{{cite web|title=THE CHOICE "THAT DARE NOT SPEAK ITS NAME"|url=http://www.nrlc.org/news/2003/NRL02/pres.html|website=Nrlc.org|year=2003|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
