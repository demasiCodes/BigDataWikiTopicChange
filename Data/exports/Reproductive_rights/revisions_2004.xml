Some of those who oppose the use of the term claim that such legal protection, especially in regards to abortion, is an abuse of the term "right" and amount to a "right to kill the innocent". They also argue that such rights are not guaranteed by the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and have little or no precedent in human history. 

Supporters consider it misleading to say that a political leader "supports abortion", when he or she simply supports a woman's right to choose without governmental interference.  The term "reproductive rights" is used to describe this position.
