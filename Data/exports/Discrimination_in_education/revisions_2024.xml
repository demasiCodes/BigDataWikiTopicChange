{{Discrimination sidebar|state=collapsed}}

'''Discrimination in education''' is the act of [[discrimination|discriminating]] against people belonging to certain demographics in enjoying full [[right to education]]. It is a violation of [[human rights]]. Education discrimination can be on the basis of [[ethnicity]], [[nationality]], age, gender, race, economic condition, language spoken, [[Caste#Caste and higher education|caste]], [[disability]] and [[religion]].

The [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]] adopted by [[UNESCO]] on 14 December 1960 aims to combat discrimination and [[racial segregation]] in [[education]]. As of December 2020, 106 states were members of the convention.

==Teacher bias in grading==
In several countries, teachers were shown to systematically give students different grades for an identical work, based on categories like [[ethnicity]] or [[gender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Teacher Bias: The Elephant in the Classroom| work = The Graide Network| date = 27 August 2018| access-date = 2020-02-24| url = https://www.thegraidenetwork.com/blog-all/2018/8/1/teacher-bias-the-elephant-in-the-classroom}}{{Cite web| last = Sommers| first = Christina Hoff| title = The War Against Boys| work = The Atlantic| access-date = 2020-02-24| date = 2000-05-01| url = https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/05/the-war-against-boys/304659/}}{{Cite news| last = Coughlan| first = Sean| title = Teachers 'give higher marks to girls'| work = BBC News| access-date = 2020-02-24| date = 2015-03-05| url = https://www.bbc.com/news/education-31751672}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the Education Longitudinal Study, "teacher expectations [are] more predictive of college success than most major factors, including student motivation and student effort".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002) - Overview: Purpose| access-date = 2020-02-24| url = https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/els2002/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Grading [[bias]] can be detected by comparing the outcome of exams where the teacher knows the student's characteristics with blind exams where the student is anonymous. This method may underestimate the bias since, for written exams, the [[handwriting]] style might still convey information about the student.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1257/app.20140022| issn = 1945-7782| volume = 7| issue = 4| pages = 53–75| last1 = Breda| first1 = Thomas| last2 = Ly| first2 = Son Thierry| title = Professors in Core Science Fields Are Not Always Biased against Women: Evidence from France| journal = American Economic Journal: Applied Economics| date = October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Experimental Evidence on Teachers' Racial Bias in Student Evaluation, "teachers rated a student's writing sample lower when it was randomly signaled to have a black author versus a white author. This study found that this bias was dependent on the teacher and their relationship and attitude towards race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Experimental Research on Teachers' Racial Bias in Student Evaluation: The Role of Grading Scales |url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/dmq/files/quinn-racial-bias-grading-eepa-2020.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other studies apply the same method to cohorts spanning multiple years, to measure each teacher's individual biases.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Alternatively, teacher's grading bias can be measured experimentally, by giving teachers a fabricated assignment where only the name (and thus gender and ethnicity) of the student differs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00481| pmid = 29867618| pmc = 5954233| issn = 1664-1078| volume = 9| last1 = Bonefeld| first1 = Meike| last2 = Dickhäuser| first2 = Oliver| title = (Biased) Grading of Students' Performance: Students' Names, Performance Level, and Implicit Attitudes| journal = Frontiers in Psychology| pages = 481| date = 2018| doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexism ===
{{Further|Discrimination against men#Education|Sex differences in education}}
Multiple studies in various disciplines and countries found that teachers systematically give higher grades to girls and women.
This bias is present at every level of education, in [[elementary school]] (United States&lt;ref&gt;

Grading discrimination is also present in university admission exams: in the United States, the counselors who evaluate students for [[college admission]] favor women over men.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.econedurev.2017.08.004| issn = 0272-7757| volume = 60| pages = 86–96| last = Hanson| first = Andrew| title = Do college admissions counselors discriminate?

In France, it was shown that in the admission exam for elite school [[École Normale Supérieure]], juries were biased against men in male-dominated disciplines (such as mathematics, physics or  philosophy) and biased against women in female-dominated ones (such as biology or literature).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
Similar results were obtained for teacher's accreditation exams at the end of university.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.aaf4372| issn = 0036-8075 | volume = 353| issue = 6298| pages = 474–478| last1 = Breda| first1 = Thomas| last2 = Hillion| first2 = Mélina| title = Teaching accreditation exams reveal grading biases favor women in male-dominated disciplines in France| journal = Science| date = 2016-07-29| pmid = 27471301| bibcode = 2016Sci...353..474B | hdl = 10419/145213| s2cid = 8762245 | url = https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:iza:izadps:dp10079 | hdl-access = free}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Female teachers tend to have a stronger pro-female bias than male teachers.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal| last1 = Lavy| first1 = Victor| last2 = Megalokonomou| first2 = Rigissa| title = Persistency in Teachers' Grading Bias and Effects on Longer-Term Outcomes: University Admissions Exams and Choice of Field of Study| journal = National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series| access-date = 2020-02-24| date = 2019-06-27| url = https://www.nber.org/papers/w26021.pdf}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Using individual teacher effects, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s [[Camille Terrier]] showed that teachers' bias affects male students' motivation and impairs their future progress.&lt;ref name="Terrier"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = A helping hand for girls? Gender bias in marks and its effect on student progress {{!}} Institut des Politiques Publiques – IPP| date = 11 December 2014| access-date = 2020-02-24| url = https://www.ipp.eu/en/publication/n14-a-helping-hand-for-girls-gender-bias-in-marks-and-its-effect-on-student-progress/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It can also significantly affect the students' career decisions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;
There is some evidence that students are aware of the unfair grading. For example, middle school boys tend to expect lower grades from female teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.jpubeco.2013.05.002| issn = 0047-2727| volume = 105| pages = 116–130| last1 = Ouazad| first1 = Amine| last2 = Page| first2 = Lionel| title = Students' perceptions of teacher biases: Experimental economics in schools| journal = Journal of Public Economics| date = 2013-09-01| url = http://cee.lse.ac.uk/ceedps/ceedp133.pdf| access-date = 2020-09-29| archive-date = 2021-09-01| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210901023616/http://cee.lse.ac.uk/ceedps/ceedp133.pdf| url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Racism ===
According to a study from [[Germany]], students from the Turkish [[ethnic minority]] are given lower grades than native Germans.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

In 1999, [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] (NUS) had called for the introduction of anonymous marking and claimed racial and sexual discrimination had impacted the results of students. NUS cited a study which showed "the marks awarded to black students at one London university were 4.2 per cent lower than those given to their white peers. And at a Welsh university, 42 per cent of men got first class or upper second degrees compared with 34 per cent of women. In Scotland, Asian students comprised 20 per cent of those on a particular course, but represented 80 per cent of those who had failed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Smithers |first1=Rebecca |last2=Smithers |first2=By Rebecca |last3=Correspondent |first3=Education |title=NUS claims racial bias in exams |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/mar/10/rebeccasmithers |website=The Guardian |date=10 March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study conducted in 2009 starts by stating, "Teachers' expectations seem to affect students' behavior." This indicates that discrimination beginning in classrooms perhaps includes teachers' perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Farago |first1=Flora |last2=Sanders |first2=Kay |last3=Gaias |first3=Larissa |title=Addressing Race and Racism in Early Childhood: Challenges and Opportunities |journal=Discussions on Sensitive Issues |series=Advances in Early Education and Day Care |date=1 January 2015 |volume=19 |pages=29–66 |doi=10.1108/S0270-402120150000019004|isbn=978-1-78560-293-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordint to a 2015 US study, lassroom discussion around race today much less negative than one would find in the past. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Farago |first1=Flora |last2=Sanders |first2=Kay |last3=Gaias |first3=Larissa |title=Addressing Race and Racism in Early Childhood: Challenges and Opportunities |journal=Advances in Early Education and Day Care |date=3 October 2015 |volume=19 |pages=29–66 |doi=10.1108/S0270-402120150000019004|isbn=978-1-78560-293-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This article discusses a process called anti-bias curriculum. This advocates for classroom and parent discussion around issues of discrimination, privilege, oppression, and racism with young children. This allows room for children to develop skills with these topics. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Farago |first1=Flora |last2=Sanders |first2=Kay |last3=Gaias |first3=Larissa |title=Addressing Race and Racism in Early Childhood: Challenges and Opportunities |journal=Advances in Early Education and Day Care |date=3 October 2015 |volume=19 |pages=29–66 |doi=10.1108/S0270-402120150000019004|isbn=978-1-78560-293-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 study showed that African American middle and high school students who heard messages from teachers about ignoring race felt less connected to others at school
and held a more negative view of their academic abilities. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Farago |first1=Flora |last2=Sanders |first2=Kay |last3=Gaias |first3=Larissa |title=Addressing Race and Racism in Early Childhood: Challenges and Opportunities |journal=Discussions on Sensitive Issues |series=Advances in Early Education and Day Care |date=1 January 2015 |volume=19 |pages=29–66 |doi=10.1108/S0270-402120150000019004 |isbn=978-1-78560-293-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Farago |first1=Flora |title=Addressing Race and Racism in Early Childhood: Challenges and Opportunities |date=2015-10-03 |work=Advances in Early Education And Day Care |volume=19 |pages=29–66 |editor-last=Sutterby |editor-first=John A. |url=https://scholarworks.sfasu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=humansci_facultypubs |access-date=2024-04-25 |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited |language=en |doi=10.1108/s0270-402120150000019004 |isbn=978-1-78560-293-1 |last2=Sanders |first2=Kay |last3=Gaias |first3=Larissa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 UK study found that anonymous marking had a neligible impact in reducing performance differences between student populations from differing ethnic, sexual and socio-economic backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hinton |first1=Daniel P. |last2=Higson |first2=Helen |title=A large-scale examination of the effectiveness of anonymous marking in reducing group performance differences in higher education assessment |journal=PLOS ONE |date=15 August 2017 |volume=12 |issue=8 |pages=e0182711 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0182711 |doi-access=free |pmid=28813457 |bibcode=2017PLoSO..1282711H |language=en |issn=1932-6203|hdl=2436/620592 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2019 report by Universities UK found that student’s race and ethnicity significantly affect their degree outcomes. According to this report from 2017–18, there was a 13% gap between the likelihood of white students and Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) students graduating with a first or 2:1 degree classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The degree awarding gap - RGS |url=https://www.rgs.org/research/higher-education-resources/the-degree-awarding-gap |website=www.rgs.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Black, Asian and Minority Student Attainment at UK Universities: Close the gap |url=https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/sites/default/files/field/downloads/2021-07/bame-student-attainment.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==

===Australia===
{{see also|Education in Australia}}
Australia has had a history of [[racial discrimination]] against [[Indigenous Australian]]s in many areas, including education. In 1966, Australia signed the Convention against Discrimination in Education. Each state now has comprehensive anti-discrimination laws that prohibit such discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human rights |url=http://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/HumanRights/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=[[Attorney-General of Australia]]|access-date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Australia enacted the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1992|''Disability Discrimination Act 1992'' (Cwth)]] to outlaw [[ableism|discrimination]] against students with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Disability standards for education |url=http://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/HumanRights/DisabilityStandards/Pages/Disabilitystandardsforeducation.aspx |publisher=[[Attorney-General of Australia]] |access-date=20 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722064034/http://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/HumanRights/DisabilityStandards/Pages/Disabilitystandardsforeducation.aspx |archive-date=22 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
Although all people are entitled to nine years of compulsory education in China, there are reports showing that minorities including people with [[disabilities]] are discriminated against in basic education.&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;{{cite book|title="As Long as They Let Us Stay in Class" Barriers to Education for Persons with Disabilities in China|date=2013|publisher=Human Rights Watch|location=New York|isbn=9781623130343|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/726990/as-long-as-they-let-us-stay-in-class-hrw.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such discrimination that is reflected in the 2013 [[Human Rights Watch]] report is of children with [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)]] and intellectual disability who were denied enrollment in nearby schools due to their disabilities. Their parents then had to travel long distances from home to find a place for their disabled children for basic education.

There are also policies for geographical allocation of available sits in higher education system which led to [[Regional discrimination in China|regional discrimination in the Higher Education Entrance Examination]]. In China every person has a place of origin in connection to his/her birthplace, and moving or resettlement to provinces/zones other than the ones of origin are subject to receive permits from the authorities. The students subject to regional discrimination are those who managed to have a better record in the relevant exams but are denied studying at top universities due to their place of origin.

===Cuba===
Cuba has a diverse and multicultural society and there is potentially an available arena for various forms of racial discrimination to grow. Some believe the Cuban educational system suffers from racial discrimination, especially against [[Afro-Cubans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Race as a Challenge to Cuba's Educational System- Havana times |url=http://www.havanatimes.org/?p=99205|date = October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= For Blacks in Cuba, the Revolution Hasn't Begun- The New York Times |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/opinion/sunday/for-blacks-in-cuba-the-revolution-hasnt-begun.html|date = March 2013|last1=Zurbano |first1=Roberto }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the existence of counterparts who believe otherwise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Cuba Has No Racial Discrimination- Havana times |url=http://www.havanatimes.org/?p=90853l|date = April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; can not be neglected.

In the 1960s and 1970s, when the [[sexual minority]] groups were sentenced to stay in rehabilitation camps, they automatically lost the opportunity for higher education and were bound to "re-education" by the state. In 2010, [[Fidel Castro]] acknowledged such discrimination during his rule, regretting that he did not pay enough attention to the "great injustice" suffered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Fidel Castro regrets discrimination against gays in Cuba- The Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/cuba/7976488/Fidel-Castro-regrets-discrimination-against-gays-in-Cuba.html|date = September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic Republic of Iran===
After the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic revolution]], the new government focused on the [[Islamization]] of the country's educational system. [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] was in strong favor of single-sex schools and expressed it in his speech at the anniversary of the birth of [[Fatimah bint Muhammad]], which soon became policy in the country. The political figure stated:{{blockquote|"As the religious leaders have influence and power in this country, they will not permit girls to study in the same school with boys. They will not permit women to teach at boys' schools. They will not permit men to teach at girls' schools. They will not allow corruption in this country."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=After Khomeini : the Iranian Second Republic|last=Ehteshami, Anoushiravan.|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=020329775X|location=London|oclc=50322313}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}The current constitution of Iran states in Article 4 that: "All civil, penal, financial, economic, administrative, cultural, military, political, and other laws and regulations must be based on Islamic criteria. This principle applies absolutely and generally to all articles of the Constitution as well as to all other laws and regulations" The cultural and religious embodiments of [[Androcentrism]] can be seen throughout the countries infrastructure and policies. For instance, Iran still considers ''household and childcare as women's primary responsibility,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and politics in the Islamic republic of Iran : action and reaction|last=Vakil, Sanam.|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=9781441192141|location=London|oclc=818460967}}&lt;/ref&gt; as shown through the difference in school criteria between the two sexes. In addition, Bahá'í students have been systematically expelled from Iranian universities on grounds of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Bahá'í student expelled from Iranian university 'on grounds of religion'-The guardian|website=[[TheGuardian.com]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/27/bahai-student-expelled-iranian-university|date = February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
