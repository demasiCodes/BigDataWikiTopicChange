{{Genocide}}
'''Cultural genocide''' or '''cultural cleansing''' is a concept that lawyer [[Raphael Lemkin]] distinguished in 1944 as a component of [[genocide]]. The term was considered in the 2007 [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] and juxtaposed next to the term "[[ethnocide]]," but it was removed in the final document, and simply replaced with "genocide." The precise definition of "cultural genocide" remains unclear. Some ethnologists, such as [[Robert Jaulin]], use the term "ethnocide" as a substitute for "cultural genocide",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=La paix blanche : introduction à l’ethnocide |author=Robert Jaulin |authorlink=Robert Jaulin |publisher=Éditions du Seuil |year=1970 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this usage has been criticized as engendering a risk of confusing ethnicity with culture.&lt;ref name="DelantyKumar2006"/&gt;

==Usage==
As early as 1944, lawyer Raphael Lemkin distinguished a cultural component of genocide, which since then has become known as "cultural genocide".&lt;ref name="AutoCK-1"/&gt; The term has since acquired rhetorical value as a phrase that is used to protest against the destruction of cultural heritage. It is also often misused as a catchphrase to condemn any form of destruction which the speaker disapproves of, without regard for the criterion of intent to destroy an affected group as such.

===Proposed usage===
The drafters of the 1948 [[Genocide Convention]] considered the use of the term, but later dropped it from their consideration.&lt;ref name="AbtahiWebb2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davidson2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoCK-2"/&gt; The legal definition of [[genocide]] is unspecific about the exact way in which genocide is committed, only stating that it is destruction with the intent to destroy a racial, religious, ethnic or national group as such.&lt;ref name="AutoCK-3"/&gt;

Article 7 of a 1994 draft of the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] used the phrase "cultural genocide" but did not define what it meant.&lt;ref name="AutoCK-4"/&gt; The complete article in the draft read as follows:
:Indigenous peoples have the collective and individual right not to be subjected to [[ethnocide]] and cultural genocide, including prevention of and redress for:
::(a) Any action which has the aim or effect of depriving them of their integrity as distinct peoples, or of their cultural values or ethnic identities;
::(b) Any action which has the aim or effect of dispossessing them of their lands, territories or resources;
::(c) Any form of [[population transfer]] which has the aim or effect of violating or undermining any of their rights;
::(d) Any form of [[acculturation|assimilation or integration]] by other cultures or ways of life imposed on them by legislative, administrative or other measures;
::(e) Any form of propaganda directed against them.

This wording only appeared in a draft. The [[United Nations]] Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] during its 62nd session at [[UN Headquarters]] in [[New York City]] on 13 September 2007, but only mentions "genocide, or any other act of violence" in Article 7 (the only reference to genocide in the document).  The concept of "ethnocide" and "cultural genocide" was removed in the version adopted by the General Assembly, but the sub-points noted above from the draft were retained (with slightly expanded wording) in Article 8 that speaks to "the right not to be subject to forced assimilation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf|title=United Nations Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples|publisher=United Nations|page=5|date=13 September 2007|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In practice==
It involves the eradication and destruction of cultural artifacts, such as books, artworks, and structures, and the suppression of cultural activities that do not conform to the destroyer's notion of what is appropriate. Motives may include religious ones (e.g., [[iconoclasm]]), as part of a campaign of [[ethnic cleansing]] in order to remove the evidence of a people from a specific locale or history, as part of an effort to implement a [[Year Zero (political notion)|Year Zero]], in which the past and its associated culture is deleted and history is "reset", the suppression of an indigenous culture by invaders and colonisers, along with many other potential reasons.

From 2014 to 2015, in areas that it controls, the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) has carried out a [[Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL|campaign of cultural cleansing]], destroying artifacts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Robinson|first=Julian|date=26 February 2015|title=ISIS thugs take a hammer to civilisation|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2970270/Islamic-State-fighters-destroy-antiquities-Iraq-video.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Mail]]|location= |access-date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and historical sites in a campaign of iconoclasm waged against what it believes is [[idolatry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=3 February 2015|title=UNESCO deplores ‘cultural cleansing’ of Iraq as armed extremists ransack Mosul libraries |url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=49982#.VO9cjoweLMI|newspaper=United Nations News Centre|location= |access-date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included in this campaign of destruction are [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] Islamic sites, including shrines and mosques,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/middle-east/38261-140726-isil-destroys-ancient-shrines-in-iraq|title=ISIL destroys ancient shrines in Iraq|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=26 July 2014|website= |publisher=[[i24news]]|access-date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and artifacts that do not conform to ISIL's interpretation of Islam.

==Examples of the term's usage==
The term has been used to describe the destruction of [[cultural heritage]] in connection with various events:

* The [[persecution of Bahá'ís]] in Iran as a case of [[religious persecution]] has been called a cultural genocide by some scholars.&lt;ref name="AutoCK-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoCK-14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Frelick | first = Bill | title =Iranian Baha'is and Genocide Early Warning| journal =Social Science Record | volume =24| issue =2| pages =35–37| date =Fall 1987 | language =

* In reference to the [[Axis powers]] (primarily, [[Nazi Germany]])'s policies towards some nations during [[World War II]] (ex. [[Polish culture during World War II|the destruction of Polish culture]])&lt;ref name="AutoCK-5"/&gt;
* In 2007, a Canadian Member of Parliament criticized the Ministry of Indian Affairs' destruction of documents regarding the treatment of First Nations members as "cultural genocide."&lt;ref name="AutoCK-6"/&gt;
* The [[Khachkar destruction in Nakhchivan|destruction by Azerbaijan]] of thousands of medieval Armenian gravestones at a cemetery in [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]], and Azerbaijan's subsequent denial that the site had ever existed, has been cited as an example of cultural genocide by some scholars.&lt;ref name="AutoCK-7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoCK-8"/&gt;
* Branch of the [[Japan Society for the Promotion of Science]], the [[History of Poland (1939–1945)|German occupation of Poland]] and the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation of Korea]] have also been cited as cases of cultural genocide.&lt;ref name="AutoCK-9"/&gt;
* In 1989, [[Robert Badinter]], a French criminal lawyer known for his stance against the [[death penalty]], used the term "cultural genocide" on a television show to describe what he said was the disappearance of [[Tibetan culture]] in the presence of the [[14th Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref name="AutoCK-10"/&gt; The Dalai Lama would later use the term himself in 1993&lt;ref name="AutoCK-11"/&gt; and again [[2008 Tibetan unrest|in 2008]].&lt;ref name="AutoCK-12"/&gt;
* Historian [[Jean Brownfield]] cited the 1638 [[Treaty of Hartford (1638)|Treaty of Hartford]] as a "clear and explicit historical example of a cultural genocide, in which the  [[Pequot language]] and name were outlawed and there was a clearly stated intention that this cultural entity would simply cease to exist."&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Jean F. Brownfield, "The Dark Pits of American History" (Forward; Ch. 3)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Existing attempts by the [[Chinese Communist Party]] to suppress the usage of [[Cantonese]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/cantonese-language-could-disappear-says-ubc-linguist-zoe-lam-1.3053933 |title=Cantonese language could disappear, says UBC linguist Zoe Lam |publisher=CBC News |date=29 April 2015 |accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Indian Residential Schools Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] of Canada concluded that the [[Canadian Indian residential school system]] "can best be described as 'cultural genocide.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/03/world/americas/canadas-forced-schooling-of-aboriginal-children-was-cultural-genocide-report-finds.html|title=Canada's Forced Schooling of Aboriginal Children Was 'Cultural Genocide,' Report Finds|publisher=NY Times|date=2 June 2015|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The instances of German cultural genocide, which Lemkin took as his basis, cannot be ignored when conducting comparative research.""One of the most striking features of Japan's occupation of Korea is the absence of an awareness of Korea as a "colony", and the absence of an awareness of Koreans as a "separate ethnicity". As a result, it is difficult to prove whether or not the leaders of Japan aimed for the eradication of the Korean race."&lt;/ref&gt;
