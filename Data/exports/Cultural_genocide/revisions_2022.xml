{{Genocide}}
'''Cultural genocide''' or '''cultural cleansing''' is a concept which was proposed by lawyer [[Raphael Lemkin]] in 1944 as a component of [[genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bilsky |first1=Leora |last2=Klagsbrun |first2=Rachel |title=The Return of Cultural Genocide? |journal=European Journal of International Law |date=23 July 2018 |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=373–396 |doi=10.1093/ejil/chy025 |url=https://academic.oup.com/ejil/article/29/2/373/5057075 |access-date=2 May 2020 |language=en |issn=0938-5428|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the precise definition of ''cultural genocide'' remains contested, the [[Tsitsernakaberd|Armenian Genocide Museum]] defines it as "acts and measures undertaken to destroy nations' or ethnic groups' culture through spiritual, national, and cultural destruction."&lt;ref name="genocide-museum.am"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genocide-museum.am/eng/cultural_genocide.php|title=Genocide Museum {{!}} The Armenian Genocide Museum-institute|website=www.genocide-museum.am|access-date=10 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Ethnology|ethnologists]], such as [[Robert Jaulin]], use the term ''[[ethnocide]]'' as a substitute for ''cultural genocide'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=La paix blanche : introduction à l'ethnocide |author=Robert Jaulin |author-link=Robert Jaulin |publisher=Éditions du Seuil |year=1970 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this usage has been criticized as risking the confusion between [[ethnicity]] and [[culture]].&lt;ref name="DelantyKumar2006" /&gt; Juxtaposed next to ''ethnocide'', ''cultural genocide'' was considered in the 2007 [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]]; however, it was removed in the final document and simply replaced with "genocide".

== Definition ==
The legal definition of ''[[genocide]]'' is unspecific about the exact way in which genocide is committed, only stating that it is destruction with the [[genocidal intent|intent to destroy]] a racial, religious, ethnic or national group.&lt;ref name="AutoCK-3" /&gt;

Among many other potential reasons, cultural genocide may be committed for religious motives (e.g., [[iconoclasm]]); as part of a campaign of [[ethnic cleansing]] in order to remove the evidence of a people from a specific locale or history; as part of an effort to implement a [[Year Zero (political notion)|Year Zero]], in which the past and its associated culture is deleted and history is "reset".

Cultural genocide involves the eradication and destruction of [[cultural artifact]]s, such as books, artworks, and structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cultural Genocide, Stolen Lives: The Indigenous Peoples of Canada and the Indian Residential Schools |url=https://www.facinghistory.org/stolen-lives-indigenous-peoples-canada-and-indian-residential-schools/chapter-7/cultural-genocide |website=Facing History and Ourselves |publisher=Facing History and Ourselves|access-date=3 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Such practices are forbidden during an armed conflict under the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907#Hague Convention of 1907|Hague Convention of 1907 Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land]], which states in Article 25 that "the attack or bombardment, by whatever means, of towns, villages, dwellings, or buildings which are undefended is prohibited"; in Article 27 that "in sieges and bombardments all necessary steps must be taken to spare, as far as possible, buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, or charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals, and places where the sick and wounded are collected, provided they are not being used at the time for military purposes"; and in Article 28 that "the pillage of a town or place, even when taken by assault, is prohibited."
*In the Americas, the [[Roerich Pact]] became the first international treaty substantially expanding and entirely dedicated to protection of [[cultural property]]; its Article 1 states: "The historic monuments, museums, scientific, artistic, educational and cultural institutions shall be considered as neutral and as such respected and protected by belligerents. The same respect and protection shall be due to the personnel of the institutions mentioned above. The same respect and protection shall be accorded to the historic monuments, museums, scientific, artistic, educational and cultural institutions in time of peace as well as in war."
*Following the experiences of World War II and the success of the regional [[Roerich Pact]], a new global treaty, the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]], was adopted, followed by its two supplentary protocols. Under the Second Protocol to the latter convention, it is obligatory for the contracting parties to penalise the perpetrators of such acts. 
*In addition, the [[World Heritage Site]]s are also at any time protected by the [[World Heritage Convention]], which states in Article 4: "Each State Party to this Convention recognizes that the duty of ensuring the identification, protection, conservation, presentation and transmission to future generations of the cultural and natural heritage referred to in Articles 1 and 2 and situated on its territory, belongs primarily to that State. It will do all it can to this end, to the utmost of its own resources and, where appropriate, with any international assistance and co-operation, in particular, financial, artistic, scientific and technical, which it may be able to obtain", while under Article 6 (3), "Each State Party to this Convention undertakes not to take any deliberate measures which might damage directly or indirectly the cultural and natural heritage referred to in Articles 1 and 2 situated on the territory of other States Parties to this Convention."
*The basic rules were reinforced by the two 1977 protocols to the 1949 [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Convention]]
**Article 53 of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), 8 June 1977, states: "Without prejudice to the provisions of the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 14 May 1954, and of other relevant international instruments, it is prohibited: to commit any acts of hostility directed against the historic monuments, works of art or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples; to use such objects in support of the military effort; to make such objects the object of reprisals."
**Article 16 of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II), 8 June 1977, states: "Without prejudice to the provisions of the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 14 May 1954, it is prohibited to commit any acts of hostility directed against historic monuments, works of art or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples, and to use them in support of the military effort."
*If the perpetrators are not penalised due to failure or unwillingness of a state to prosecute them, they may be brought to justice under the [[Rome Statute]], adopted in July 1998 and entering into force four years later, the legal basis of the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), which defines in Article 8(2) the following cultural property-related [[war crimes]] in both international and non-international armed conflicts: "Intentionally launching an attack in the knowledge that such attack will cause incidental loss of life or injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects or widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment which would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated ''(international conflicts only)''; Extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly; Destroying or seizing the enemy’s/adversary’s property unless such destruction or seizure be imperatively demanded by the necessities of war/conflict; Attacking or bombarding, by whatever means, towns, villages, dwellings or buildings which are undefended and which are not military objectives; Deliberate attacks against buildings of a religious, educational, artistic, scientific or non-profit nature and against historical monuments; Pillaging a town or place, even when taken by assault."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl|title=Treaties, States parties, and Commentaries - By topic|website=ihl-databases.icrc.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====[[Intangible cultural heritage]]====
Cultural genocide may also involve [[forced assimilation]], as well as the suppression of a language or cultural activities that do not conform to the destroyer's notion of what is appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cultural Genocide, Stolen Lives: The Indigenous Peoples of Canada and the Indian Residential Schools |url=https://www.facinghistory.org/stolen-lives-indigenous-peoples-canada-and-indian-residential-schools/chapter-7/cultural-genocide |website=Facing History and Ourselves|publisher=Facing History and Ourselves |access-date=3 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Article 2 of the [[Genocide Convention]] defines the following intangible culture-related aspects of [[genocide]]: "Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group";
*Article 27 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] mandates the rights of [[ethnic group|ethnic]], [[religious minorities|religious]] and [[minority language|linguistic minority]] to enjoy their own culture, to profess their own religion, and [[linguistic rights|to use their own language]]. 
*Article 15 of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] assures [[minority groups]] the right to practice and preserve their languages, religions, art forms, and ways of life.
*[[The International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid]] lists, among others: "any legislative measures and other measures calculated to prevent a racial group or groups from participation in the political, social, economic and cultural life of the country and the deliberate creation of conditions preventing the full development of such a group or groups, in particular bу denying to members of a racial group or groups basic human rights and freedoms, including the right to work, the right to form recognized trade unions, the right to education, the right to leave and to return to their country, the right to a nationality, the right to freedom of movement and residence, the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association; any measures, including legislative measures, designed to divide the population along racial lines by the creation of separate reserves and ghettos for the members of a racial group or groups, the prohibition of mixed marriages among members of various racial groups, the expropriation of landed property belonging to a racial group or groups or to members thereof" – as a manifestation of the crime of [[apartheid]] and requires the States Parties to prosecute perpetors of such practices. If it is not the case due to failure or unwillingness of a state to prosecute them, they may be brought to justice under the Rome Statute (see below)
*Some of the abovementioned oppressive or repressive practices are illegal also under the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], in particular its Article 20(3) concerning the choice of foster placement: "When considering solutions, due regard shall be paid to the desirability of continuity in a child's upbringing and to the child's ethnic, religious, cultural and linguistic background", as well as Article 30, which states that "In those States in which ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities or persons of indigenous origin exist, a child belonging to such a minority or who is indigenous shall not be denied the right, in community with other members of his or her group, to enjoy his or her own culture, to profess and practise his or her own religion, or to use his or her own language."
*The [[Rome Statute]]
**Article 6 defines the following intangible culture-related aspects of [[genocide]]: "Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group";
**Article 7 (1) defines the following intangible culture-related [[crimes against humanity]]: "Enslavement; Deportation or forcible transfer of population; Rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity; Persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender as defined in paragraph 3, or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law, in connection with any act referred to in this paragraph or any crime within the jurisdiction of the Court; The crime of apartheid.";
**Article 8 (2) defines the following intangible culture-related [[war crimes]]: "Committing outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment; Committing rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, as defined in article 7, paragraph 2 (f), enforced sterilization, or any other form of sexual violence also constituting a grave breach of the Geneva Convention; Unlawful deportation or transfer or unlawful confinement; The transfer, directly or indirectly, by the Occupying Power of parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies, or the deportation or transfer of all or parts of the population of the occupied territory within or outside fthis territory; Ordering the displacement of the civilian population for reasons related to the conflict, unless the security of the civilians involved or imperative military reasons so demand."
*Under Article 11 of the [[Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage]], "each State Party shall take the necessary measures to ensure the safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage present in its territory", while under Article 19 (2), "Without prejudice to the provisions of their national legislation and customary law and practices, the States Parties recognize that the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage is of general interest to humanity, and to that end undertake to cooperate at the bilateral, subregional, regional and international levels."
*In Europe, the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] ([[Council of Europe]] members, including all European sovereign countries, except for [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]] and the [[Vatican City]]) and the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]] (all European sovereign countries, except for [[Belarus]], [[Belgium]], [[Greece]], [[France]], [[Iceland]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Turkey]] and the [[Vatican City]]) greatly expand the protection against such activities, as well as provide the necessary legal means (tools) to safeguard and exercise these rights in practice, in particular an application to the [[European Court of Human Rights]]
**in the European Union, additional protection of the cultural, religious and linguistic diversity is granted by the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]], in particular by its titles II (Freedoms) and III (Equality); it may be enforced in practice through an application to the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]]

== History ==

=== Etymology ===
The notion of 'cultural genocide' has been acknowledged as early as 1944, when lawyer [[Raphael Lemkin]] distinguished a cultural component of genocide. The term itself would not emerge until later.&lt;ref name="AutoCK-1"/&gt; In 1989, [[Robert Badinter]], a French criminal lawyer known for his stance against the [[death penalty]], used the term "cultural genocide" on a television show to describe what he said was the disappearance of [[Tibetan culture]] in the presence of the [[14th Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref name="AutoCK-10"/&gt; The Dalai Lama would later use the term in 1993&lt;ref name="AutoCK-11"/&gt; and he would use it again [[2008 Tibetan unrest|in 2008]].&lt;ref name="AutoCK-12"/&gt;

===Proposed inclusion in the UN's DRIP===
{{see also | United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples }}

Those who drafted the 1948 [[Genocide Convention]] initially considered using of the term, but later dropped it from inclusion.&lt;ref name="AbtahiWebb2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davidson2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoCK-2"/&gt;

Article 7 of a 1994 draft of the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] (DRIP) uses the phrase "cultural genocide" but does not define what it means.&lt;ref name="AutoCK-4"/&gt; The complete article in the draft read as follows:
:Indigenous peoples have the collective and individual right not to be subjected to [[ethnocide]] and cultural genocide, including prevention of and redress for:
::(a) Any action which has the aim or effect of depriving them of their integrity as distinct peoples, or of their cultural values or ethnic identities;
::(b) Any action which has the aim or effect of dispossessing them of their lands, territories or resources;
::(c) Any form of [[population transfer]] which has the aim or effect of violating or undermining any of their rights;
::(d) Any form of [[acculturation|assimilation or integration]] by other cultures or ways of life imposed on them by legislative, administrative or other measures;
::(e) Any form of propaganda directed against them.

This wording only ever appeared in a draft. The DRIP—which was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] during its 62nd session at [[UN Headquarters]] in [[New York City]] on 13 September 2007—only makes reference to genocide once, when it mentions "genocide, or any other act of violence" in Article 7. Though the concept of "ethnocide" and "cultural genocide" was removed in the version adopted by the General Assembly, the sub-points from the draft noted above were retained (with slightly expanded wording) in Article 8 that speaks to "the right not to be subject to forced assimilation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2018/11/UNDRIP_E_web.pdf|title=United Nations Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples|publisher=United Nations|page=10|date=13 September 2007|access-date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== List of cultural genocides ==
The term has been used to describe the destruction of [[cultural heritage]] in connection with various events listed mainly from the 20th century:

===Europe===
* Historian Stephen Wheatcroft states that Soviet peasantry were subject to cultural destruction in the creation of the "[[New Soviet man]]".&lt;ref name=wheatcroft&gt;The Complexity of the Kazakh Famine: Food Problems and Faulty Perceptions Stephen G. Wheatcroft&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the [[Bosnian War]] during the [[Siege of Sarajevo]], cultural genocide was committed by Bosnian Serb forces. The [[National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was specifically targeted and besieged by cannons positioned all around the city. The National Library was completely destroyed in the fire, along with 80 percent of its contents. Some 3 million books were destroyed, along with hundreds of original documents from the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Deutsche Welle|title=Burned library symbolizes multiethnic Sarajevo |date=25 August 2012 |url=https://www.dw.com/en/burned-library-symbolizes-multiethnic-sarajevo/a-16192965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*After the [[Greek Civil War]], Greek authorities had conducted a cultural genocide upon [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Slavic Macedonians]] in Northern Greece through prohibition of communication in [[Slavic languages]], renaming of cities, towns and villages ([[Lerin]]/Лерин to [[Florina]] etc.), deportation of Slavic Macedonians, particularly women and children, as well as many other actions intended to marginalize and oppress the Slavic Macedonians residing in Northern Greece. While some of these actions had been motivated by political ideology, as many of the Slavic Macedonians had sided with the defeated communists, the majority of actions were committed in order to wipe out any traces of Slavic Macedonians or their culture in Northern Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1994-05-01|title=Denying Ethnic Identity|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/1994/05/01/macedonians-greece|access-date=2021-05-10|website=Human Rights Watch|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=2019-02-24|title=Greece's invisible minority - the Macedonian Slavs|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-47258809|access-date=2021-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Francoist Spain]]: the alleged prohibition of the use of minority languages such as Catalan in the public space, from schools to shops, public transport, or even in the streets, the banning of the use of Catalan birth names for children, the persecution and destruction of books in [[Catalan language]],{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} renaming of cities, streets and all toponyms from Catalan to Spanish, and the abolition of government and all cultural institutions in [[Catalonia]], with the goal of total cultural suppression and [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Catalunya sota el règim franquista|last=Benet|first=Josep|date=1978|publisher=Blume|isbn=847031064X|edition=1. reedició|location=Barcelona|oclc=4777662}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
** [[John D. Hargreaves]] writes that "A policy of cultural genocide was implemented: the Catalan language and key symbols of Catalan independent identity and nationhood, such as the flag (the [[senyera]]), the national hymn ('[[Els Segadors]]') and the national dance (the [[sardana]]), were proscribed. Any sign of independence or opposition, in fact, was brutally suppressed. Catalan identity and consequently the Catalan nation were threatened with extinction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Freedom for Catalonia? : Catalan nationalism, Spanish identity, and the Barcelona Olympic Games|last=Hargreaves|first=John E.|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521586153|location=Cambridge|oclc=51028883}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
** Although [[Josep Pla]] and other Catalan authors published books in Catalan in the 1950s, and even there were prizes of Catalan Literature during Francoism like the [[Premi Sant Jordi de novel·la]], editorial production in Catalan never recovered the peak levels it had reached before Spanish Civil War  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Benet|first=Josep|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7188603|title=Cataluña bajo el régimen franquista|date=1979|publisher=Blume|isbn=84-7031-144-1|edition=1.|location=Barcelona|oclc=7188603}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://www.gremieditors.cat/historia-de-ledicio-a-catalunya/]. A prominent case of popularization of Catalan was [[Serrat|Joan Manuel Serrat]]: although he could compose Catalan songs and gained certain notoriety, he was not allowed to sing in Catalan in the Eurovision contest its [[La, la, la]]. theme, and was replaced by Spanish singer [[Massiel]], who won the [[Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision]] contest [https://eurovisionary.com/catalonia-crisis-eurovision-spain-blocked-catalan-victory/]. Overall, despite some tolerance as Franco's regime relaxed in the late 60s and early 70s, Catalan and the rest of minority languages of Spain were strictly banned from higher education, administration and all official endeavors, thus being in practice confined to the private sphere and domestic uses (see [[Language policies of Francoist Spain]]).

*[[France]]'s [[Language policy in France|policies]] (also known as ''[[Vergonha]]'' in [[Occitan language|Occitan]]) towards its various [[Languages of France|regional and minority languages]], referring to non-standard French as [[patois]], have been described as genocide by professor of Catalan [[philology]] at the [[University of the Balearic Islands]] [[:ca:Jaume Corbera i Pou|Jaume Corbera i Pou]] who argues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Corbera |first1=Jaume |title=Le patois des vieux |url=https://www.dbalears.cat/opinio/opinio/2001/09/23/63269/le-patois-des-vieux.html |access-date=14 December 2021 |agency=Diari de Balears |date=23 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When at the mid-19th century, primary school is made compulsory all across the State, it is also made clear that only French will be taught, and the teachers will severely punish any pupil speaking in ''patois''. The aim of the French educational system will consequently not be to dignify the pupils' natural humanity, developing their culture and teaching them to write their language, but rather to humiliate them and morally degrade them for the simple fact of being what tradition and their nature made them. The self-proclaimed country of the "[[human rights]]" will then ignore one of man's most fundamental rights, the right to be himself and speak the language of his nation. And with that attitude France, the "grande France" that calls itself the champion of liberty, will pass the 20th century, indifferent to the timid protest movements of the various linguistic communities it submitted and the literary prestige they may have given birth to.

[...]

France, that under [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s reign was seen here [in [[Catalonia]]] as the safe haven of freedom, has the miserable honour of being the [only] State of [[Europe]]—and probably the world — that succeeded best in the diabolical task of destroying its own ethnic and linguistic patrimony and moreover, of destroying human family bonds: many parents and children, or grandparents and grandchildren, have different languages, and the latter feel ashamed of the first because they speak a despicable ''patois'', and no element of the grandparents' culture has been transmitted to the younger generation, as if they were born out of a completely new world. This is the French State that has just entered the 21st century, a country where stone monuments and natural landscapes are preserved and respected, but where many centuries of popular creation expressed in different tongues are on the brink of extinction. The "gloire" and the "grandeur" built on a genocide. [[liberté, égalité, fraternité|No liberty, no equality, no fraternity]]: just cultural extermination, this is the real motto of the French Republic.

The instances of German cultural genocide, which Lemkin took as his basis, cannot be ignored when conducting comparative research.""One of the most striking features of Japan's occupation of Korea is the absence of an awareness of Korea as a "colony", and the absence of an awareness of Koreans as a "separate ethnicity".
