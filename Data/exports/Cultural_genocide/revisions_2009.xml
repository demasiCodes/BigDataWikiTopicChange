==Relevance to international law==

As early as 1933, [[Raphael Lemkin]] proposed a cultural component to genocide, which he called "[[vandalism]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preventgenocide.org/lemkin/madrid1933-english.htm Raphael Lemkin, ''Acts Constituting a General (Transnational) Danger Considered as Offences Against the Law of Nations'' (J. Fussell trans., 2000) (1933)]; [http://www.preventgenocide.org/lemkin/AxisRule1944-3.htm Raphael Lemkin, ''Axis Rule in Occupied Europe'', p. 91 (1944)].&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, the drafters of the 1948 [[Genocide Convention]] dropped that concept from their consideration.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-3.htm#IIIG2bi Prosecutor v. Krstic, Case No. IT-98-33-T (Int'l Crim. Trib. Yugo. Trial Chamber 2001), at para. 576].
&lt;/ref&gt; The legal definition of [[genocide]] is left unspecific about the exact nature in which genocide is done only that it is destruction with intent to destroy a racial, religious, ethnic or national group as such.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/p_genoci.htm Convention on Prevention and Punishment of Genocide, art. 2, Dec. 9, 1948, 78 U.N.T.S. 277.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 7 of a 1994 draft of the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] uses the phrase "cultural genocide" but does not define what it means.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/(Symbol)/E.CN.4.SUB.2.RES.1994.45.En?OpenDocument Draft United Nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples] drafted by The Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities Recalling  resolutions 1985/22 of 29 August 1985, 1991/30 of [[29 August]] [[1991]], 1992/33 of [[27 August]] [[1992]], 1993/46 of [[26 August]] [[1993]], presented to the Commission on Human Rights and the Economic and Social Council at 36th meeting [[26 August]] [[1994]] and adopted without a vote.&lt;/ref&gt; The complete article reads as follows:
:Indigenous peoples have the collective and individual right not to be subjected to [[ethnocide]] and cultural genocide, including prevention of and redress for:
::(a) Any action which has the aim or effect of depriving them of their integrity as distinct peoples, or of their cultural values or ethnic identities;
::(b) Any action which has the aim or effect of dispossessing them of their lands, territories or resources;
::(c) Any form of [[population transfer]] which has the aim or effect of violating or undermining any of their rights;
::(d) Any form of [[acculturation|assimilation or integration]] by other cultures or ways of life imposed on them by legislative, administrative or other measures;
::(e) Any form of propaganda directed against them.

It should be noted that this declaration only appeared in a draft. The [[United Nations]] Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] during its 62nd session at [[UN Headquarters]] in [[New York City]] on 13 September 2007, but only mentions "genocide", not "cultural genocide", although the article is otherwise unchanged.

Beside its legal currency, the term has acquired rhetorical value as a phrase that is used to protest against the destruction of cultural heritage. It is also often misused as a catchphrase to condemn any destruction the user of the phrase disapproves of, without regard for the criterion of intent to destroy an affected group as such.

==Examples of the term's usage==

Cultural advocates have leveled charges of "cultural genocide" in connection with various events: 

* In reference to the [[Axis powers]] (primarily, [[Nazi Germany]]) policies towards some nations in World War II (ex. [[Polish culture during World War II|destruction of Polish culture]])&lt;ref&gt;William Schabas, ''Genocide in international law: the crimes of crimes'', Cambridge University Press, 2000, ISBN 0521787904, [http://books.google.com/books?id=pYptuRHDQPgC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=%22Cultural+genocide%22+Poand Google Print, p.179]&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2007, a Canadian Member of Parliament criticized the Ministry of Indian Affairs' destruction of documents regarding the treatment of First Nations members as "cultural genocide."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmontonsun.com/News/Canada/2007/04/25/4127962-sun.html Jorge Barrera , ''‘Genocide’ target of fed coverup: MP'', Edmonton Sun, April 25, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
* The [[Khachkar destruction in Nakhchivan|destruction by Azerbaijan]] of thousands of medieval Armenian gravestones at a cemetery in [[Julfa]], and Azerbaijan's subsequent denial that the site had ever existed, has been widely written about as being an example of cultural genocide.&lt;ref&gt;History Today, November 2007, "Sacred Stones Silenced in Azerbaijan"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Switzerland-Armenia Parliamentary Group, "The Destruction of Jugha", Bern, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

* When Turkey's Minister of Cultural Affairs re-opened the medieval Armenian [[Aghtamar]] church in eastern Anatolia as a museum, critics objected to the use of its Turkified name, seeing in it a denial of the region's Armenian heritage and as a sort of "cultural genocide".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=69531 Cengiz Çandar, ''The So-Called ‘Akdamar museum’'', Turkish Daily News, March 30, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

* Some scholars have discussed whether "cultural genocide" properly describes Japan's suppression of [[Korean language]], traditions, and names, and the teaching of [[Korean history]] during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation of Korea]] from 1910 to 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cgs.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/workshops_e/w_2004_02_23_e.html CGS 1st Workshop: “Cultural Genocide” and the Japanese Occupation of Korea&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Some right-wing and far right activists have applied the term "cultural genocide" to what they see as a downfall of Western civilization due to liberal immigration policies, diversity, and multiculturalism.&lt;ref name=bnp&gt;[http://www.bnp.org.uk/news_detail.php?newsId=357 ''The Era of Defamation and Multi-Cultural Genocide''] The [[British National Party]] claims "multi-cultural genocide" in progress against Britain.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kkk&gt;[http://www.davidduke.com/?p=179 ''John Tyndall Arrested ''] Former [[Ku-Klux Klan]] leader [[David Duke]] claims cultural genocide against Whites&lt;/ref&gt;

* In [[1989]], [[Robert Badinter]], a high-profile [[France|French]] [[Criminal law|criminal]] [[lawyer]], participated to a famous french television program, ''Apostrophes'', devoted to  human rights, in the presence of the [[Tenzin Gyatso|14th Dalaï Lama]]. Talking about the disappearance of the [[Tibetan culture]] in [[Tibet]], Robert Badinter used the term  "cultural genocide".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ina.fr/archivespourtous/index.php?vue=notice&amp;from=fulltext&amp;full=Salonique&amp;num_notice=5&amp;total_notices=8 Les droits de l'homme Apostrophes, A2 - 21/04/1989 - 01h25m56s], Web site of the [[Institut national de l'audiovisuel|INA]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Later on, and for the first time in [[1993]], the  Dalaï Lama used the same term of cultural genocide to describe the destruction of the Tibetan culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dalailama.com/page.104.htm 10th March Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, at the time of [[2008 Tibetan unrest]], the Dalai Lama accused [[China]] of practising cultural genocide against the peoples of [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7299212.stm BBC NEWS | World | Asia-Pacific | 'Eighty killed' in Tibetan unrest&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

*According to Rebiya Kadeer, the President of Uyghur American Association, "In the name of so called bi-lingual education, the Chinese authorities have begun to impose the Chinese language and replace the [[Uighur]] language. They began to gradually erase Uighur people's language, scripture, literature, and the way of life. We consider this a sort of cultural genocide, a way to gradually eradicate the Uighur people." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZ7rt6vRSQ&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[South Korea]]ns have accused [[United States]] Christian missionaries of "cultural genocide" for their success in converting large number of South Koreans to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theage.com.au/world/korean-buddhists-rally-against-prochristian-bias-20080827-4446.html&lt;/ref&gt;
