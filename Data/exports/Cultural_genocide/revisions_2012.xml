The term was considered in the 2007 [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] juxtaposed next to the term '''ethnocide''', but it was removed in the final document, replaced with simply "genocide". The precise definition of "cultural genocide" remains unclear.

==Usage==
As early as 1933, lawyer Raphael Lemkin proposed a cultural component to genocide, which he called "[[vandalism]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preventgenocide.org/lemkin/madrid1933-english.htm Raphael Lemkin, ''Acts Constituting a General (Transnational) Danger Considered as Offences Against the Law of Nations'' (J. Fussell trans., 2000) (1933)]; [http://www.preventgenocide.org/lemkin/AxisRule1944-3.htm Raphael Lemkin, ''Axis Rule in Occupied Europe'', p. 91 (1944)].&lt;/ref&gt; The term has since acquired rhetorical value as a phrase that is used to protest against the destruction of cultural heritage. It is also often misused as a catchphrase to condemn any destruction the user of the phrase disapproves of, without regard for the criterion of intent to destroy an affected group as such.

===Proposed usage===
The drafters of the 1948 [[Genocide Convention]] considered the use of the term, but dropped it from their consideration.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-3.htm#IIIG2bi Prosecutor v. Krstic, Case No. IT-98-33-T (Int'l Crim. Trib. Yugo. Trial Chamber 2001), at para. 576].
&lt;/ref&gt; The legal definition of [[genocide]] is left unspecific about the exact nature in which genocide is done only that it is destruction with intent to destroy a racial, religious, ethnic or national group as such.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/p_genoci.htm Convention on Prevention and Punishment of Genocide, art. 2, Dec. 9, 1948, 78 U.N.T.S. 277.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 7 of a 1994 draft of the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] uses the phrase "cultural genocide" but does not define what it means.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/(Symbol)/E.CN.4.SUB.2.RES.1994.45.En?OpenDocument Draft United Nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples] drafted by The Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities Recalling  resolutions 1985/22 of 29 August 1985, 1991/30 of 29 August 1991, 1992/33 of 27 August 1992, 1993/46 of 26 August 1993, presented to the Commission on Human Rights and the Economic and Social Council at 36th meeting 26 August 1994 and adopted without a vote.&lt;/ref&gt; The complete article reads as follows:
:Indigenous peoples have the collective and individual right not to be subjected to [[ethnocide]] and cultural genocide, including prevention of and redress for:
::(a) Any action which has the aim or effect of depriving them of their integrity as distinct peoples, or of their cultural values or ethnic identities;
::(b) Any action which has the aim or effect of dispossessing them of their lands, territories or resources;
::(c) Any form of [[population transfer]] which has the aim or effect of violating or undermining any of their rights;
::(d) Any form of [[acculturation|assimilation or integration]] by other cultures or ways of life imposed on them by legislative, administrative or other measures;
::(e) Any form of propaganda directed against them.

This declaration only appeared in a draft. The [[United Nations]] Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] during its 62nd session at [[UN Headquarters]] in [[New York City]] on 13 September 2007, but only mentions "genocide", not "cultural genocide", although the article is otherwise unchanged.

==Examples of the term's usage==
The term was used for describing destruction of [[cultural heritage]] in connection with various events:

* In reference to the [[Axis powers]] (primarily, [[Nazi Germany]]) policies towards some nations in World War II (ex. [[Polish culture during World War II|destruction of Polish culture]])&lt;ref&gt;William Schabas, ''Genocide in international law: the crimes of crimes'', Cambridge University Press, 2000, ISBN 0-521-78790-4, [http://books.google.com/books?id=pYptuRHDQPgC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=%22Cultural+genocide%22+Poand Google Print, p.179]&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2007, a Canadian Member of Parliament criticized the Ministry of Indian Affairs' destruction of documents regarding the treatment of First Nations members as "cultural genocide."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmontonsun.com/News/Canada/2007/04/25/4127962-sun.html Jorge Barrera , ''‘Genocide’ target of fed coverup: MP'', Edmonton Sun, April 25, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Khachkar destruction in Nakhchivan|destruction by Azerbaijan]] of thousands of medieval Armenian gravestones at a cemetery in [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]], and Azerbaijan's subsequent denial that the site had ever existed, has been widely written about as being an example of cultural genocide.&lt;ref&gt;History Today, November 2007, "Sacred Stones Silenced in Azerbaijan"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Switzerland-Armenia Parliamentary Group, "The Destruction of Jugha", Bern, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Branch of the [[Japan Society for the Promotion of Science]], the [[History of Poland (1939–1945)|Germany's occupation of Poland]] and the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japan's occupation of Korea]] has been mentioned as a case of cultural genocide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cgs.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/workshops_e/w_2004_02_23_e.html CGS 1st Workshop: “Cultural Genocide” and the Japanese Occupation of Korea] "During Germany's occupation of Poland (1939-1945) and Japan's occupation of Korea (1910-1945), the prohibition of use of the native tongue, the renaming of people and places, the removal of indigenous people from institutions of higher education, the destruction of cultural facilities, the denial of freedom of religious faith, and the changing of cultural education all took place. The instances of German cultural genocide, which Lemkin took as his basis, cannot be ignored when conducting comparative research."&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1989, [[Robert Badinter]], a French criminal lawyer known for his stance against the [[death penalty]], used the term "cultural genocide" on a television show to describe what he said was the disappearance of [[Tibetan culture]] in the presence of the [[14th Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ina.fr/archivespourtous/index.php?vue=notice&amp;from=fulltext&amp;full=Salonique&amp;num_notice=5&amp;total_notices=8 Les droits de l'homme Apostrophes, A2 - 21 April 1989 - 01h25m56s], Web site of the [[Institut national de l'audiovisuel|INA]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Dalai Lama would later use the term himself in 1993&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dalailama.com/page.104.htm 10th March Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[2008 Tibetan unrest|in 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7299212.stm | work=BBC News | title='Eighty killed' in Tibetan unrest | date=2008-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shia clergy, as well as many Iranians, have continued to regard Bahá'ís as heretics, and consequently Bahá'ís have encountered much prejudice and sometimes persecution historically. The situation of the Bahá'ís improved under the Pahlavi shahs when the government actively sought to secularize public life however there were still organizations actively persecuting the Bahá'ís in addition to there being curses children would learn decrying the Báb, a central figure of the religion, and Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="debate"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fischer | first = Michael|authorlink = Michael Fischer | last2 = Abedi | first2 = Mehdi | author2-link = Mehdi Abedi | title = Debating Muslims | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press | year = 1990 | location = Madison, Wisconsin | pages = 48–54, 222–250 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=J5RGlpx0j8sC&amp;pg=PA48 | isbn = 0-299-12434-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Hojjatieh]].
