The activities which the Government in Exile accuses the Chinese government of performing include closing Tibetan Buddhist temples and encouraging outside immigration into Tibet.

Opponents of the term argue that the PRC government while wishing to stop secessionist activity in Tibet does not actively desire to see Tibetan culture eradicated.  They also point out that it is improper to use such a highly charged word as [[genocide]] to describe any cultural change, especially since
Chinese policies in Tibet have been far less assimilationist than the policies of many nations which are making the criticism.</rev></revisions></page></pages></query></api>
