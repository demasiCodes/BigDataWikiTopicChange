Particularly in the U.S., the term is used to imply that underqualified members of minority groups are being hired and promoted instead of more qualified members of majority groups.

It is worth noting that in particular, [[racial quota]]s for collegiate admission were held to be unconstitutional in the United States, although non-quota race preferences are legal.

Many legal cases involving claims of "reverse discrimination" are settled before they go to court. [http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761580666/Affirmative_Action.html]
