In many democratic societies, the dominant group is in the majority, and the disadvantaged is in the minority.

The terms ''Discrimination'' and ''Reverse discrimination'' are used to describe policies or habits of social discrimination with an implication of unfairness. 

Social discrimination on certain grounds is now illegal in many countries, but in some [[affirmative action]] favoring the minorities is required by law (e.g. [[USA]]), while in others such action would be regarded as reverse discrimination, and would be illegal (e.g. [[UK]].)

Opposing views of Affirmative Action are discussed more fully in that article.
