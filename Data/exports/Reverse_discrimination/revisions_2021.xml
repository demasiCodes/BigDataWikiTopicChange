{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''Reverse discrimination''' is a term for [[discrimination]] against members of a dominant or majority group, in favor of members of a minority or historically disadvantaged group. Groups may be defined in terms of [[ethnicity]], [[gender identity]], [[nationality]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[religion]], [[sex]], or [[sexual orientation]].{{Original research inline|date=October 2020}}

Conceptualizing [[affirmative action]] as reverse discrimination became popular among white conservatives in the early- to mid-1970s. This was a time period during which these policies focused on the under-representation of ethnic minority groups and women, and attempted to remedy the effects of past discrimination in both government and the business world.&lt;ref name="Embrick"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Embrick |first1=David G. |editor1-last=Schaefer |editor1-first=Richard T. |title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity, and Society, Volume 1 |date=2008 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=978-1-41-292694-2 |pages=12–19 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMUola6pDnkC&amp;q=%22reverse+discrimination%22&amp;pg=PT64 |chapter=Affirmative Action in Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When members of a particular group have been barred from a particular employment, it is said{{By whom|date=August 2020}} that this group has received less than its fair share of employment, in question, and deserves to receive more by way of compensation. Thus, this group is being compensated for past lack of employment or opportunity.{{Clarify|date=August 2020|reason=Does this mean that reverse discrimination is a form of compensation for past discrimination? Should be made more explicit}} Therefore, a group already existing in the workplace will be discriminated against, even if they have never been denied employment previously. An example of this would be an organization's efforts to hire more women in order to meet federal guidelines. However, in thus doing, the organization may deny opportunities of equal measures to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schultz|title=psychology and work today|year=2010|isbn=978-0-205-68358-1|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the point of reverse discrimination is to compensate a wronged group, it will hardly matter{{According to whom|date=August 2020}} if those who are preferentially hired were not among the original victims of discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cher|first=George|title=Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs, Vol 4, No.2 Winter: Justifying Reverse Discrimination in Employment|year=1975|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|pages=159–170|jstor=2265161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[James Rachels]] posited that reverse discrimination as a factor in [[affirmative action in the United States]] may disadvantage some Whites, but without it, African Americans would likewise be disadvantaged by pervasive racial discrimination in society.&lt;ref name="Fullinwider"&gt;{{cite SEP |last=Fullinwider |first=Robert |title=Affirmative Action |edition=Summer 2018 |url-id=affirmative-action}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of racial preferences in affirmative action such as [[William Bennett]] and [[Carl Cohen (professor)|Carl Cohen]] have argued that explicitly using race for the purpose of ending racial discrimination is illogical and contrary to the principle of non-discrimination. Conversely, [[Alan H. Goldman]] argued that short-term violations of such a principle could be justified for the sake of equalizing social opportunities in the longer term.{{r|Fullinwider}} Philosopher [[Richard Arneson]] argues that while a program of reverse discrimination favoring non-White candidates over White ones may violate [[equality of opportunity]] in a formal sense, it may more effectively promote {{em|substantive}} equality of opportunity, meaning that those with equal talent and ambition will have the same chances of success regardless of their previous (unequal) opportunities to achieve the relevant qualifications.&lt;ref name="Arneson"&gt;{{cite SEP |last=Arneson |first=Richard  |title=Equality of Opportunity |edition=Summer 2015 |section=2.4 Affirmative Action |url-id=equal-opportunity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often argued by majority groups that they are being discriminated against for hiring and advancement because of affirmative-action policies. However, critics{{Who|date=August 2020}} of this argument often cite the "symbolic" significance of a job has to be taken into consideration as well as qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baer|first=Judith|author-link=Judith A.

{{expand section|date=September 2012}}

In [[European Union law]], reverse discrimination occurs where a Member State's national law provides for worse treatment of its own citizens or domestic products than other EU citizens/goods under EU law. This is permitted in the EU because of the legal principle of [[subsidiarity]], that EU law is not applicable in situations purely internal to one Member State.&lt;ref name="Ritter"&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=954242 |last1=Ritter |first1=Cyril |title=Purely Internal Situations, Reverse Discrimination, Guimont, Dzodzi and Article 234 |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |date=2006 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.954242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[affirmative action]] of the Chinese government has been called into question, especially from the ethnic group of [[Han Chinese]]. Unfair policies on Chinese College entrance exams as well as human rights considered to be favoring the national minority have both been believed to be causing reverse discrimination in the mainland. [[Han chauvinism]] has been becoming more popular in mainland China since the 2000s, the cause of which has been attributed to the discontent towards Chinese affirmative action.&lt;ref name="凭栏观史"&gt;《凭栏观史》第34期：中国到底有没有大汉族主义&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="皇汉史观：今天我们如何定义中国？"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.dwnews.com/china/news/2017-04-26/59812518.html|title = 皇汉史观今天我们如何定义中国｜多维新闻网｜中国|date = 26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[one-child policy]] was only introduced for Han Chinese, with minorities being allowed two or more childs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Whyte|first1=Martin King|last2=Feng|first2=Wang|last3=Cai|first3=Yong|date=July 2015|title=Challenging Myths About China's One-Child Policy|journal=The China Journal|language=en|volume=74|pages=144–159|doi=10.1086/681664|issn=1324-9347|pmc=6701844|pmid=31431804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference in merit on entrance exams is often very less between the reserved and unreserved classes.  In [[India]], the term is often used by citizens protesting against [[Reservation in India|reservation and quotas]]. But it has also come under increasing criticism in light of EWS cutoffs of forward communities being lower than OBC cutoffs. &lt;ref&gt;Devanesan Nesiah. ''Discrimination With Reason?

Opponents of [[Affirmative action in the United States]] use the term ''reverse discrimination'' to say that such programs discriminate against [[White Americans]] in favor of [[African Americans]].&lt;ref name="Carlisle"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Carlisle |editor1-first= Rodney P. |title= Encyclopedia of Politics: The Left and The Right |date=2005 |publisher=SAGE Publications |location=Thousand Oaks, Calif. |isbn=978-1-41-290409-4 |page=1009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6I5DQAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22reverse+discrimination%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Nancy MacLean]] writes that during the 1980s and 1990s, "so-called reverse discrimination occurred on an inconsequential scale".&lt;ref name="MacLean"&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacLean |first1=Nancy |title=Freedom is Not Enough: The Opening of the American Work Place |date=2006 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-02749-7 |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of reverse discrimination cases filed with the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) doubled in the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=W.D|title=Reverse Discrimination claims: Growing like kudzu|journal=Maryland Bar Journal|year=2004|pages=48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to reflect a growing percentage of all discrimination cases {{As of|2003|lc=yes}}.&lt;ref name="Pincus 2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pincus |first=Fred L. |title=Reverse discrimination: Dismantling the myth |url=https://archive.org/details/reversediscrimin0000pinc |url-access=registration |date=2003 |publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers |location=Boulder, Colorado |isbn=978-1-58-826203-5}}{{page needed |date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by S. K. Camara &amp; M. P. Orbe collected narratives of individuals describing situations where they were discriminated against based on their majority-group status (cases of reverse discrimination). Many White respondents described discrimination based on their race, a smaller portion reported gender discrimination. A small number of heterosexuals reported experiencing discrimination based on their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Sakile 111–134"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sakile K. Camara|first=Mark P.

=== Colleges ===

White college applicants who have felt passed over in favor of less-qualified Black students as a result of affirmative action in college admissions have described such programs as "reverse discrimination". [[Elizabeth Purdy]] argues that this conception of reverse discrimination came close to overturning affirmative action during the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] resurgence of the 1980s and '90s after being granted legitimacy by the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Regents of the University of California v. Bakke]]'', which ruled that Alan Bakke had been discriminated against by the school's admissions program.&lt;ref name="Purdy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Purdy |first=Elizabeth |editor1-last=Carlisle |editor1-first= Rodney P. |title= Encyclopedia of Politics: The Left and The Right, Volume 1: The Left |date=2005 |publisher=SAGE Publications |location=Thousand Oaks, Calif. |isbn=978-1-41-290409-4 |page=133 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6I5DQAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22reverse+discrimination%22 |chapter=Desegregation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] had to defer the use of racial preferences in their college admissions after the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] barred the school from considering race in admitting students. The ruling determined that diversity in education could not justify making race-based distinctions. [[Hopwood v. Texas]] was a lawsuit brought by four white applicants to the Texas Law School who were denied admission even though their [[grade point average]]s were greater than minority applications that were accepted. The four white students also had greater Law School Admission Test scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robert, Menache|first=Brian H Kleiner|title=New Developments in Reverse Discrimination|journal=Equal Opportunities International|year=1999|volume=18|issue=2/3/4|page=41|doi=10.1108/02610159910785790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in [[Grutter v. Bollinger]] (2003), the Supreme Court allowed the University of Michigan Law School to continue to consider race among other relevant diversity factors. The decision was the only legally challenged affirmative-action policy to survive the courts. However, this ruling has led to confusion among universities and lower courts alike regarding the status of affirmative action across the nation.

In 2012, [[Fisher v. University of Texas (2013)|Fisher v. University of Texas]] reached the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6161900559426345780&amp;q=Abigail+Fisher&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,7&amp;as_ylo=2012|title=Google Scholar|work=google.com|access-date=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The University of Texas allegedly used race as a factor in denying Abigail Fisher's application, denying her a fair review. The lower courts upheld the program, but the Supreme Court vacated the judgment of the lower courts and sent the case back to the Fifth Circuit for review.

=== Complaints ===
A draft report on claims of reverse discrimination was prepared for the [[United States Department of Labor]] in 1995.{{efn|The report, by [[Rutgers University]] law professor Alfred W. Blumrosen, stated there were at most 100 reverse-discrimination cases among at least 3,000 discrimination opinions by Federal district and appeals courts from 1990 to 1994. National surveys showed only a few{{vague|date=July 2020}} whites had experienced reverse discrimination, and 5 to 12 percent of whites believed that they had been denied a job or promotion because of it. 2% of cases were of white men charging sexual, racial or national origin discrimination and 1.8% were of white women charging racial discrimination.&lt;ref name="Blumrosen"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blumrosen |first=Alfred |title=How the Courts are Handling Reverse Discrimination Claims (Draft Report on Reverse Discrimination) |year=1995 |journal=Daily Labor Report |publisher=Bureau of National Affairs |location=Arlington, Va. |volume=147 |page=D-43 |issn=1522-5968}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Its analysis of employment discrimination cases in federal courts between 1990 and 1994 concluded that between 1 and 3 percent involved claims of reverse discrimination; and that a "high proportion" of the claims were found to be without merit.&lt;ref name="Bendick"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bendick |first1=Marc |title=Social policy: affirmative action |journal=International Journal of Economic Development |date=2000 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=256–275 |url=https://go.gale.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CA176368824 |issn=1523-9748 |url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newer reports by the EEOC have found that less than 10% of race-related complaints were filed by whites, 18% of gender-related complaints and 4% of the court cases were filed by men.
