==Definitions==

===Romantic relationships and identity===
Asexuals, while lacking in sexual desire for any gender, may engage in purely emotional [[Romance (love)|romantic]] relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asexuality.org/home/relationship.html ''Relationship FAQ''] The Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN), 2008). Retrieved 22 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gayline.gen.nz/asexual.htm ''Asexuality''] (Wellington, N.Z.: Gay Line Wellington, 2000–2010). Retrieved 22 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Terms concerning this are:
* '''aromantic''': lack of romantic attraction towards anyone
* '''biromantic''': romantic attraction that is both heteroromantic and homoromantic (but not necessarily at the same time)&amp;nbsp;– the romantic aspect of [[bisexuality]]
* '''heteroromantic''': romantic attraction towards person(s) of a different gender&amp;nbsp;– the romantic aspect of [[heterosexuality]]
* '''homoromantic''': romantic attraction towards person(s) of the same gender&amp;nbsp;– the romantic aspect of [[homosexuality]]
* '''panromantic''': romantic attraction towards  person(s) of ''every'' gender&amp;nbsp;– the romantic aspect of [[pansexuality]]
* '''transromantic''': romantic attraction towards person(s) of  intersex or transgender&amp;nbsp;– the romantic aspect of [[transsexuality]]
*'''andromantic and gyneromantic''': romantic attraction towards person(s) expressing masculinity or femininity (respectively) without implying the gender of the individual experiencing the attraction; often used by asexuals with a non-[[gender binarism|binary]] [[gender identity]]. The romantic aspect of [[androphilia and gynephilia]].

The Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN) defines an asexual as "someone who does not experience sexual attraction" and stated, "[a]nother small minority will think of themselves as asexual for a brief period of time while exploring and questioning their own sexuality" and that "[t]here is no litmus test to determine if someone is asexual. Asexuality is like any other identity&amp;nbsp;– at its core, it’s just a word that people use to help figure themselves out. If at any point someone finds the word asexual useful to describe themselves, we encourage them to use it for as long as it makes sense to do so".&lt;ref name=Overview/&gt;

Researchers have varied in their attempts to define asexuality, but the term is usually defined to mean the lack or absence of sexual attraction or sexual interest. This may be defined as having little sexual attraction or desire, no sexual attraction or desire, or a combination thereof with or without the characteristic of behavior,&lt;ref name= Bogaert2006/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prause"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DePaulo"&gt;{{cite web|first=Bella|last=DePaulo|title=ASEXUALS: Who Are They and Why Are They Important?|work=[[Psychology Today]]|date=26 September 2011|accessdate=13 December 2011|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/living-single/200912/asexuals-who-are-they-and-why-are-they-important}}&lt;/ref&gt; as researchers have used the term "to refer to individuals with low or absent sexual desire or attractions, low or absent sexual behaviors, exclusively romantic non-sexual partnerships, or a combination of both absent sexual desires and behaviors".&lt;ref name="Prause"/&gt;

As an emerging identity with a broad definition, there is an enormous amount of variation among people who identify as asexual; for example, asexual-identified individuals who report that they feel sexual attraction but not the inclination to act on it because they have no true desire or need to engage in sexual or even non-sexual activity (cuddling, hand-holding, etc.).&lt;ref name="Prause"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DePaulo"/&gt; Some asexuals participate in sexual activity out of curiosity.&lt;ref name="Prause"/&gt; Some may [[Masturbation|masturbate]] as a solitary form of release, while others do not feel a need to do so.&lt;ref name="New Scientist" /&gt; The need or desire for masturbation is commonly referred to as a "[[libido|sex drive]]" and is disassociated from sexual attraction and being sexual; asexuals who masturbate generally consider it to be a normal product of the human body and not a sign of latent sexuality, and may not even find it pleasurable.&lt;ref name="Prause"/&gt; Some asexual men are completely unable to get an erection and sexual activity is completely impossible for them.&lt;ref name="More to life"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carrigan|first=Mark|title=There's More to Life Than Just Sex?

===Sexual orientation and etiology===
There is significant debate over whether asexuality is a [[sexual orientation]] or not.&lt;ref name="Sexual orientation"/&gt; It is most comparable to [[hypoactive sexual desire disorder]] (HSDD), in the sense that both imply a general lack of sexual attraction to anyone, but asexuality is generally not considered a disorder (such as [[anorgasmia]], [[anhedonia]], etc.) or a [[sexual dysfunction]] because asexuality does not necessarily define someone as having a medical problem or problems relating to others socially.&lt;ref name="DePaulo"/&gt; It also does not necessarily imply that lacking sexual attraction causes anxiety; it is considered the lack or absence of sexual attraction as a life-enduring characteristic.&lt;ref name="Bogaert2006"/&gt; Some scholars, however, opine that asexuality is not a meaningful category to add to the continuum of sexual orientations, and say that it is instead the lack of a sexual orientation or sexuality.&lt;ref name="Sexual orientation"/&gt; Others state that it is the denial of one's natural sexuality, and that it is a disorder caused by shame of sexuality or anxiety, sometimes basing this belief on asexuals who masturbate or occasionally engage in sexual activity simply to please a romantic partner.&lt;ref name="Sexual orientation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="More to life"/&gt;

Various other scholars assert that asexuality is a sexual orientation, as some asexuals are unable to masturbate even though they reportedly have a "normal" sex drive, and that there are variations of sexual preferences, arguing that asexuality ought to be included as well.&lt;ref name="Sexual orientation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="More to life"/&gt; They stress that asexuals do not choose to have no sexual desire, and generally start to find out their "differences" in sexual behaviors around adolescence. Because of these facts coming to light, it is argued that asexuality is much more than a behavioral choice, and is not something that can be "cured" like a disorder.&lt;ref name="More to life"/&gt;

''Etiology'' in this context is without implication of disease, disorder, or abnormality.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Webster's Third'' (''[[Merriam-Webster]]''), ''etiology'' is defined both with and without reference to disease. The word is defined as "a science or doctrine of causation or of the demonstration of causes" and as "a branch of science dealing with the causes of particular phenomena", thus without implying disease or abnormality. However, it is also defined as "all the factors that contribute to the occurrence of a disease or abnormal condition". ''Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged'' ([prob. Springfield, Mass.:] G. &amp; C. Merriam (Merriam-Webster), 1966), entry ''etiology''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the ''Shorter Oxford Eng. Dict.'' ([4th] ed.), ''etiology'' is defined both with and without reference to disease. The word is defined as "[t]he assignment of a cause", as "the cause assigned", and, as now rare or obsolete, as "[t]he philosophy of causation; the part of a science which treats of the causes of its phenomena". However, it is also defined in medicine as "[t]he causation of disease (usu., of a specified disease), esp. as a subject for investigation". ''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary: On Historical Principles'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, [4th] ed. 1993 (ISBN 0-19-861271-0)), entry ''aetiology'', via entry ''etiology''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the ''American Heritage Dict.'' (3d ed.), ''etiology'' is defined both with and without reference to disease. The word is defined as "[t]he study of causes or origins" and as "[a]ssignment of a cause, an origin, or a reason for something". However, it is also defined as "[t]he branch of medicine that deals with the causes or origins of disease" and as "[t]he cause or origin of a disease or disorder as determined by medical diagnosis". ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'' (Boston, Mass.: Houghton Mifflin, 3d ed. 1992 (ISBN 0-395-44895-6)), entry ''etiology''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In a nursing dictionary, ''etiology'' is defined relative only to disease. The word is defined as "[t]he study of the causes of disease" and as "[t]he cause of a disease", with no other definitions, in Thomas, Clayton L., ed., ''Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary'' (Philadelphia: F. A. Davis, ed. 16 8th printing 1989 (ISBN 0-8036-8310-3)), entry ''etiology''. The dictionary is intended for "those in the field of nursing" and others. ''Id.'', p. viii (Introduction to Edition 16, by Clayton Lay Thomas).&lt;/ref&gt; Research on the etiology of sexual orientation when applied to asexuality has the definitional problem that sexual orientation is not consistently defined by all researchers as including asexuality.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., one study on [[Prenatal hormones and sexual orientation#Prenatal hormones and sexuality-linked characteristics|hormonal influences]] defines sexual orientation as "heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality" only. Cited in: Garcia-Falgueras, Alicia, &amp; Swaab, Dick F. (2010). "Sexual Hormones and the Brain: An Essential Alliance for Sexual Identity and Sexual Orientation". ''Endocrine Development''. '''17''':24. PMID 19955753. (Article found in Sandro Loche, Marco Cappa, Lucia Ghizzoni, Mohamad Maghnie, &amp; Martin O. Savage, eds. Vol.17 ''Pediatric Neuroendocrinology'') ("sexual orientation (heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality)"). ISSN 1421-7082.&lt;/ref&gt; Asexuality may be considered a sexual orientation, which is defined as "enduring" and resistant to change, proving to be generally impervious to interventions intended to change it.&lt;ref name="apahelp"/&gt; However, while heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality are usually but not always determined during the early years of preadolescent life, it is not known when asexuality is determined. "It is unclear whether these characteristics [''viz.'', "lacking interest in or desire for sex"] are thought to be lifelong, or if they may be acquired."&lt;ref name="Prause"/&gt;

Non-measurement in some areas of sexual orientation is accepted by the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, and the National Association of Social Workers: "[S]imply to document that a phenomenon occurs, case studies and non-probability samples are often adequate. . . . Some groups are sufficiently few in number&amp;nbsp;– relative to the entire population&amp;nbsp;– that locating them with probability sampling is extremely expensive or practically impossible.

==Research==

===Prevalence===

In the mid-twentieth century, [[Alfred Kinsey]] rated individuals from 0 to 6 according to their sexual orientation from heterosexual to homosexual, known as the [[Kinsey scale]]. He also included a category he called "X" for individuals with "no socio-sexual contacts or reactions". He labeled 1.5% of the adult male population as ''X.''&lt;ref name="Kinsey-male"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Alfred C.|last=Kinsey|year=1948|title=Sexual Behavior in the Human Male|publisher=W.B. Saunders|isbn=0-253-33412-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinsey-female"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Alfred C.|last=Kinsey|year=1953|title=Sexual Behavior in the Human Female|publisher=W.B. Saunders|isbn=0-253-33411-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Kinsey's second book, ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'', he reported this breakdown of individuals who are X: unmarried females = 14–19%, married females = 1–3%, previously married females = 5–8%, unmarried males = 3–4%, married males = 0%, and previously married males = 1–2%.&lt;ref name="Kinsey-female" /&gt;

Further empirical data about an asexual demographic appeared in 1994, when a research team in the United Kingdom carried out a comprehensive survey of 18,876 British residents, spurred by the need for sexual information in the wake of the [[AIDS pandemic]]. The survey included a question on sexual attraction, to which 1.05% of the respondents replied that they had "never felt sexually attracted to anyone at all."&lt;ref&gt;Wellings, K. (1994). ''Sexual Behaviour in Britain: The National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles.'' Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; This study of this phenomenon was continued by the Canadian sexuality researcher Dr. Anthony Bogaert in 2004, who explored the asexual demographic in a series of studies. Bogaert believed that the 1% figure was not an accurate reflection of the likely much larger percentage of the population that could be identified as asexual, noting that in the initial survey 30% of people contacted chose not to participate in the survey. Since less sexually experienced people are more likely to refuse to participate in studies about sexuality, and asexuals tend to be less sexually experienced than sexuals, it is likely that asexuals were over-represented in the 30% who did not participate, compared to the 70% who did. The same study found the number of homosexuals and bisexuals combined to be about 1.1% of the population, which is much smaller than other studies indicate.&lt;ref name="Bogaert2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bogaert2004" /&gt; However, Bogaert's sexuality research has been scrutinized in the past, since he was involved in studies that linked race to sexual behaviors as if they had an evolutionary basis. This study was highly debated by the scientific community as potentially constituting a case of scientific racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pmid|2660278|last1=Rushton|first1=JP|last2=Bogaert|first2=AF|lastauthoramp=yes|title=''Population Differences in Susceptibility to AIDS: An Evolutionary Analysis.''|journal=''Soc Sci Med''|volume=28|issue=12|year=1989|pages=1211–20|type=abstract|publication-place=Bethesda, Md.|publisher=National Institutes of Health, National Center for Biotechnology Information, US National Library of Medicine|pmid=2660278))}} (author(s) of psychology dep't, Univ. of Western Ont., London, Canada)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual activity and sexuality===
While some asexuals masturbate as a solitary form of release or have sex for the benefit of a romantic partner ([[#Romantic relationships and identity|see above]]), others do not.&lt;ref name="Prause"/&gt; The [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction|Kinsey Institute]] sponsored another small survey on the topic in 2007, which found that self-identified asexuals "reported significantly less desire for sex with a partner, lower sexual arousability, and lower sexual excitation but did not differ consistently from non-asexuals in their sexual inhibition scores or their desire to masturbate".&lt;ref name="Prause" /&gt;

A 1977 paper titled ''Asexual and Autoerotic Women: Two Invisible Groups'', by Myra T. Johnson, may be the first paper explicitly devoted to asexuality in humans. Johnson defines asexuals as those men and women "who, regardless of physical or emotional condition, actual sexual history, and marital status or ideological orientation, seem to ''prefer'' not to engage in sexual activity." She contrasts autoerotic women with asexual women: "The asexual woman [...] has no sexual desires at all [but] the autoerotic woman [...] recognizes such desires but prefers to satisfy them alone." Johnson's evidence is mostly letters to the editor found in women's magazines written by asexual/autoerotic women. She portrays them as invisible, "oppressed by a consensus that they are nonexistent," and left behind by both the sexual revolution and the feminist movement. Society either ignores or denies their existence or insists they must be ascetic for religious reasons, neurotic, or asexual for political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;"Asexual and Autoerotic Women: Two Invisible Groups" found in ed. Gochros, H.L.; J.S. Gochros (1977). ''The Sexually Oppressed. Associated Press.'' ISBN 978-0-8096-1915-3&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study published in 1979 in ''Advances in the Study of Affect'', vol. 5, and in another article using the same data and published in 1980 in the ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', Michael D. Storms of the University of Kansas outlined his own reimagining of the Kinsey scale. Whereas Kinsey measured sexual orientation based on a combination of actual sexual behavior and fantasizing and eroticism, Storms only used fantasizing and eroticism. Storms, however, placed hetero-eroticism and homo-eroticism on separate axes rather than at two ends of a single scale; this allows for a distinction between bisexuality (exhibiting both hetero- and homo-eroticism in degrees comparable to hetero- or homosexuals, respectively) and asexuality (exhibiting a level of homo-eroticism comparable to a heterosexual and a level of hetero-eroticism comparable to a homosexual, namely, little to none). Storms conjectured that many researchers following Kinsey's model could be mis-categorizing asexual subjects as bisexual, because both were simply defined by a lack of preference for gender in sexual partners.&lt;ref name = Storms1980&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.38.5.783 | last1 = Storms | first1 = Michael D. | year = 1980 | title = Theories of Sexual Orientation | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 38 | issue = 5| pages = 783–792 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Storms1979&gt;Storms, M.

The first study that gave empirical data about asexuals was published in 1983 by Paula Nurius, concerning the relationship between sexual orientation and mental health. Unlike previous studies on the subject, she used the above-mentioned two-dimensional model for sexual orientation. Six hundred eighty-nine subjects—most of whom were students at various universities in the United States taking psychology or sociology classes—were given several surveys, including four clinical well-being scales and a survey asking how frequently they engaged in various sexual activities and how often they would like to engage in those activities. Based on the results, respondents were given a score ranging from 0 to 100 for hetero-eroticism and from 0 to 100 for homo-eroticism. Respondents who scored lower than 10 on both were labeled "asexual." This consisted of 5% of the males and 10% of the females. Results showed that asexuals were more likely to have low self-esteem and more likely to be depressed than members of other sexual orientations; 25.88% of heterosexuals, 26.54% bisexuals (called "ambisexuals"), 29.88% of homosexuals, and 33.57% of asexuals were reported to have problems with self-esteem. A similar trend existed for depression. Nurius did not believe that firm conclusions can be drawn from this for a variety of reasons. Asexuals also reported much lower frequency and desired frequency of a variety of sexual activities including having multiple partners, anal sexual activities, having sexual encounters in a variety of locations, and autoerotic activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00224498309551174 | last1 = Nurius | first1 = Paula | year = 1983| title = Mental Health Implications of Sexual Orientation | url = | journal = The Journal of Sex Research | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 119–136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though comparisons with non-human sexuality are problematic, a series of studies done on [[Ram (sheep)|ram]] mating preferences at the United States Sheep Experiment Station in [[Dubois, Idaho]], starting in 2001 found that about 2–3% of the animals being studied had no apparent interest in mating with either sex; the researchers classified these animals as asexual, but found them to be otherwise healthy with no recorded differences in [[hormone]] levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Charles A.|last=Roselli|year=2002|url=http://www.biolreprod.org/content/67/1/263.full|title=Relationship of serum testosterone concentrations to mate preferences in rams|journal=Biology of Reproduction|volume=67|pages=263–268|accessdate=31 August 2007|doi=10.1095/biolreprod67.1.263|pmid=12080026|last2=Stormshak|first2=F|last3=Stellflug|first3=JN|last4=Resko|first4=JA|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=J.N.|last=Stellflug|date=1 June 2006|url=http://jas.fass.org/content/84/6/1520.abstract|title=Comparison of cortisol, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone responses to a defined stressor in sexually inactive rams and sexually active female-oriented and male-oriented rams|journal=Journal of Animal Science|volume=84|pages=1520–1525|accessdate=31 August 2007|pmid=16699109|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent paper written by Karli June Cerankowski and Megan Milks, titled ''New Orientations: Asexuality and Its Implications for Theory and Practice'', suggests that asexuality may be somewhat of a question in itself for these studies of gender and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cerankowski|first=Karli June|coauthors=Megan Milks|title=New Orientations: Asexuality and Its Implications for Theory and Practice|journal=Feminist Studies|year=2010|volume=36|issue=3|pages=650–654}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cerankowski and Milks have found that asexuality, by means of feminist and queer studies, raises many more questions than it resolves, such as how a person could abstain from having sex which is generally accepted by society to be the most basic of instincts. The article also states that society has either deemed "[LGBT and] female sexuality as empowered or repressed. The asexual movement challenges that assumption by challenging many of the basic tenants of pro-sex feminism already defined as repressive or anti-sex sexualities."  [[Asexual Visibility and Education Network]] (AVEN) has formulated asexuality as a biologically determined orientation. This formula, if dissected scientifically and proven, would support researcher Simon LaVey's conclusive blind study of the hypothalamus in gay men, women, and straight men, which found that there is a biological difference between straight men and gay men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Myers|first=David G.|title=Psychology|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4292-1597-8|page=474|edition=9th ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community==
A community of self-identified asexuals coalesced in the early 21st century, aided by the popularity of [[Virtual community|online communities]].&lt;ref name="New Scientist" /&gt; Dr. Elizabeth Abbot, author of ''A History of Celibacy'', acknowledges a difference between asexuality and celibacy and posits that there has always been an asexual element in the population but that asexual people kept a low profile. While failure to consummate marriage was seen as "an insult to the sacrament of marriage" in medieval Europe, asexuality, unlike homosexuality, has never been illegal, and asexual people have been able to "fly under the radar". However, in the 21st century, the anonymity of online communication and general popularity of [[social network]]ing online has facilitated the formation of a community built around a common asexual identity.&lt;ref name="Duenwald"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Mary|last=Duenwald|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/09/fashion/thursdaystyles/09asexual.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=520063b1b0fd9ad7&amp;ex=1275969600&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss |title=For Them, Just Saying No Is Easy|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=9 July 2005|accessdate=17 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN) is an organization founded by American asexuality [[activist]] [[David Jay]] in 2001 that focuses on asexuality issues.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asexuality.org/home/about.html |title=About AVEN |author= |date= |work=AVEN |accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its stated goals are "creating public acceptance and discussion of asexuality and facilitating the growth of an asexual community".&lt;ref name=about /&gt; Communities such as AVEN can be beneficial to those in search of answers to solve a crisis of identity with regard to their possible asexuality. Individuals go through a series of emotional processes that end with their identifying with the asexual community. They first realize that their sexual attractions differ from those of most of society. This difference leads to questioning whether the way they feel is acceptable, and possible reasons why they feel this way. [[Pathological]] beliefs tend to follow where, in some cases, they may seek medical help because they feel they have a disease. Self-understanding is usually reached when they find a definition that matches their feelings. Asexuality communities provide support and information that allows newly identified asexuals to move from self-clarification to identifying on a communal level, which can be empowering, because they now have something to associate with, which gives normality to this overall socially-isolating situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/1363460711406462 | last1 = Carrigan | first1 = Mark | year = 2011 | title = There’s more to life than sex? Differences and commonality within the asexual community | journal = Sexualities | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 462–478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, asexual organizations and other internet resources play a key role in informing people about asexuality. The lack of research makes it difficult for doctors to understand the causation. Most people who say they are asexual are self-identified. This can be a problem when asexuality is mistaken for an intimacy or relationship problem or for other symptoms that do not define asexuality. There is also a significant population that either does not understand or does not believe in asexuality, which adds to the importance of these organizations to inform the general population; however, due to the lack of scientific fact on the subject, what these groups promote as information is often questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Engelman, Jessica.

{{anchor|Flag}} &lt;!-- Redirect target; see [[Asexual flag]] --&gt;

After a period of debate over having an '''asexual flag''' and how to set up a system to create one, and contacting as many asexual communities as possible, in August 2010 a flag was announced as the '''asexual pride flag''' by one of the team involved. The final flag had been a popular candidate and so had previously seen use in online forums outside of AVEN. The final vote was held on a survey system outside of AVEN where the main flag creation efforts were organized. The flag colors have been used in artwork and referenced in articles about the sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Money &amp;amp; Politics |url=http://recultured.com/uncategorized/09/asexuality-redefining-love-and-sexuality/ |title=Asexuality – Redefining Love and Sexuality |publisher=recultured |date=9 January 2012 |accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schneiderman)&lt;/ref&gt; have labeled asexuals as a [[protected class]]. Asexuality does not typically attract attention of the public or major scrutiny. Thus it has not been subject of legislation as other sexual orientations have.&lt;ref name=Bogaert2004 /&gt;
