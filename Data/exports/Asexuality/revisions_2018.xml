Various asexual communities have started to form since the advent of the World Wide Web and social media.

With regard to sexual activity in particular, the need or desire for masturbation is commonly referred to as ''[[libido|sex drive]]'' by asexuals and they disassociate it from sexual attraction and being sexual; asexuals who masturbate generally consider it to be a normal product of the human body and not a sign of latent sexuality, and may not even find it pleasurable.&lt;ref name="Prause"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sexual fantasy and masturbation among asexual individuals|journal = The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality|pages = 89–95|volume = 23|issue = 2|doi = 10.3138/cjhs.2409|first = Morag A.|last = Yule|first2 = Lori A.|last2 = Brotto|first3 = Boris B.|last3 = Gorzalka|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some asexual men are unable to get an erection and sexual activity by attempting penetration is impossible for them.&lt;ref name="More to life"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carrigan|first=Mark|title=There's More to Life Than Just Sex?

Many people who identify as asexual also identify with other labels. These other identities include how they define their gender and their romantic orientation.&lt;ref name="Padraig"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacNeela|first=Pádraig|last2=Murphy|first2=Aisling|date=December 30, 2014|title=Freedom, Invisibility, and Community: A Qualitative Study of Self-Identification with Asexuality|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|language=en|volume=44|issue=3|pages=799–812|doi=10.1007/s10508-014-0458-0|issn=0004-0002|pmid=25548065}}&lt;/ref&gt; They will oftentimes integrate these characteristics into a greater label that they identify with. Regarding romantic or emotional aspects of [[sexual orientation]] or [[sexual identity]], for example, asexuals may identify as [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]], [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], [[queer]],&lt;ref name=Overview/&gt;&lt;ref name="Richards and Barker"/&gt; or by the following terms to indicate that they associate with the romantic, rather than sexual, aspects of sexual orientation:&lt;ref name="Cerankowski and Milks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Richards and Barker"/&gt;

* aromantic; lack of romantic attraction towards anyone
* biromantic; as opposed to bisexual
* heteroromantic; as opposed to heterosexual
* homoromantic; as opposed to [[homosexual]]
* panromantic; as opposed to [[pansexual]]

People may also identify as a [[gray asexuality|gray-A]] (such as a gray-romantic, demiromantic, demisexual or semisexual) because they feel that they are between being aromantic and non-aromantic, or between asexuality and sexual attraction. While the term ''gray-A'' may cover anyone who occasionally feels romantic or sexual attraction, demisexuals or semisexuals experience sexual attraction only as a secondary component, feeling sexual attraction once a reasonably stable or large emotional connection has been created.&lt;ref name="Cerankowski and Milks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adler|first=Melissa|chapter=Meeting the Needs of LGBTIQ Library Users and Their Librarians: A Study of User Satisfaction and LGBTIQ Collection Development in Academic Libraries|year=2010|title=Serving LGBTIQ Library and Archives Users|editor-first=Ellen |editor-last=Greenblatt|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|location=[[North Carolina]]|isbn=978-0-7864-4894-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other unique words and phrases used in the asexual community to elaborate identities and relationships also exist. One term coined by individuals in the asexual community is ''friend-focused'', which refers to highly valued, non-romantic relationships. Other terms include ''squishes'' and ''zucchinis'', which are non-romantic crushes and queer-platonic relationships, respectively. Terms such as ''non-asexual'' and ''allosexual'' are used to refer to individuals on the opposite side of the sexuality spectrum.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chasin | first1 = CJ DeLuzio | year = 2015 | title = Making Sense in and of the Asexual Community: Navigating Relationships and Identities in a Context of Resistance | url = | journal = Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 167–180 | doi = 10.1002/casp.2203 | issn = 1099-1298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lehmiller stated, "the Kinsey X classification emphasized a lack of sexual behavior, whereas the modern definition of asexuality emphasizes a lack of sexual attraction. As such, the Kinsey Scale may not be sufficient for accurate classification of asexuality."&lt;ref name="Lehmiller"/&gt; Kinsey labeled 1.5% of the adult male population as ''X''.&lt;ref name="Kinsey-male"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinsey-female"/&gt; In his second book, ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'', he reported this breakdown of individuals who are X: unmarried females = 14–19%, married females = 1–3%, previously married females = 5–8%, unmarried males = 3–4%, married males = 0%, and previously married males = 1–2%.&lt;ref name="Kinsey-female" /&gt;

Further empirical data about an asexual demographic appeared in 1994, when a research team in the United Kingdom carried out a comprehensive survey of 18,876 British residents, spurred by the need for sexual information in the wake of the [[Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS|AIDS pandemic]]. The survey included a question on sexual attraction, to which 1.05% of the respondents replied that they had "never felt sexually attracted to anyone at all".&lt;ref&gt;Wellings, K. (1994). ''Sexual Behaviour in Britain: The National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles.'' [[Penguin Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; The study of this phenomenon was continued by Canadian sexuality researcher [[Anthony Bogaert]] in 2004, who explored the asexual demographic in a series of studies. Bogaert's research indicated that 1% of the British population does not experience sexual attraction, but he believed that the 1% figure was not an accurate reflection of the likely much larger percentage of the population that could be identified as asexual, noting that 30% of people contacted for the initial survey chose not to participate in the survey. Since less sexually experienced people are more likely to refuse to participate in studies about sexuality, and asexuals tend to be less sexually experienced than sexuals, it is likely that asexuals were under-represented in the responding participants. The same study found the number of homosexuals and bisexuals combined to be about 1.1% of the population, which is much smaller than other studies indicate.&lt;ref name="Bogaert2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bogaert2006" /&gt;

Contrasting Bogaert's 1% figure, a study by Aicken et al., published in 2013, suggests that, based on Natsal-2 data from 2000-2001, the prevalence of asexuality in Britain is only 0.4% for the age range 16–44.&lt;ref name="Fischer"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Who reports absence of sexual attraction in Britain?

=== Sexual orientation, mental health and cause ===
There is significant debate over whether or not asexuality is a sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Sexual orientation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sex and society"/&gt; It has been compared and equated with [[hypoactive sexual desire disorder]] (HSDD), in that both imply a general lack of sexual attraction to anyone; HSDD has been used to [[medicalize]] asexuality, but asexuality is generally not considered a disorder or a [[sexual dysfunction]] (such as [[anorgasmia]], [[anhedonia]], etc.), because it does not necessarily define someone as having a medical problem or problems relating to others socially.&lt;ref name="DePaulo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Richards and Barker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reconsidering Asexuality"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chasin|first=CJ DeLuzio|title=Reconsidering Asexuality and Its Radical Potential|journal=Feminist Studies|date=2013|volume=39|issue=2|page=405|url=http://cj.chasin.ca/Chasin_Reconsidering.Asexuality_FS.Vol39.2_2013.pdf|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike people with HSDD, asexual people normally&lt;!--NOTE: "Normally" is used because, as the source a little lower shows, some people who identify as asexual experience these disorders. --&gt; do not experience "marked distress" and "interpersonal difficulty" concerning feelings about their sexuality,&lt;!--NOTE: "Concerning feelings about their sexuality" is used because a person may experience one of these disorders regardless of their sexuality.--&gt; or generally a lack of [[sexual arousal]]; asexuality is considered the lack or absence of sexual attraction as a life-enduring characteristic.&lt;ref name="Bogaert2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Richards and Barker"/&gt; One study found that, compared to HSDD subjects, asexuals reported lower levels of [[sexual desire]], sexual experience, sex-related distress and [[Depression (mood)|depressive]] symptoms.&lt;ref name="brotto2015"&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Brotto, L.

The first study that gave empirical data about asexuals was published in 1983 by Paula Nurius, concerning the relationship between sexual orientation and mental health.&lt;ref name="Ruspini"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elisabetta Ruspini|author2=Megan Milks|title=Diversity in family life|isbn=978-1447300939|publisher=[[Policy Press]]|year=2013|pages=35–36|accessdate=January 4, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AjMbAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35}}&lt;/ref&gt; 689 subjects—most of whom were students at various universities in the United States taking psychology or sociology classes—were given several surveys, including four clinical well-being scales. Results showed that asexuals were more likely to have low self-esteem and more likely to be depressed than members of other sexual orientations; 25.88% of heterosexuals, 26.54% bisexuals (called "ambisexuals"), 29.88% of homosexuals, and 33.57% of asexuals were reported to have problems with self-esteem. A similar trend existed for depression. Nurius did not believe that firm conclusions can be drawn from this for a variety of reasons.&lt;ref name="Ruspini"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nurius"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00224498309551174 | last1 = Nurius | first1 = Paula | year = 1983| title = Mental Health Implications of Sexual Orientation | journal = The Journal of Sex Research | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 119–136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 study, Yule et al. looked into mental health variances between Caucasian heterosexuals, homosexuals, bisexuals, and asexuals. The results of 203 male and 603 female participants were included in the findings. Yule et al. found that asexual male participants were more likely to report having a mood disorder than other males, particularly in comparison to the heterosexual participants. The same was found for female asexual participants over their heterosexual counterparts; however, non-asexual, non-heterosexual females had the highest rates. Asexual participants of both sexes were more likely to have anxiety disorders than heterosexual and non-heterosexual participants, as were they more likely than heterosexual participants to report having had recent suicidal feelings. Yule et al. hypothesized that some of these differences may be due to discrimination and other societal factors.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yule | first1 = Morag A. | last2 = Brotto | first2 = Lori A. | last3 = Gorzalka | first3 = Boris B. | year = 2013 | title = Mental Health and Interpersonal Functioning in Self-Identified Asexual Men and Women | url = | journal = Psychology &amp; Sexuality | volume = 4 | issue = 2| pages = 136–151 | doi = 10.1080/19419899.2013.774162 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to sexual orientation categories, asexuality may be argued as not being a meaningful category to add to the continuum, and instead argued as the lack of a sexual orientation or sexuality.&lt;ref name="Sexual orientation"/&gt; Other arguments propose that asexuality is the denial of one's natural sexuality, and that it is a disorder caused by shame of sexuality, anxiety or [[sexual abuse]], sometimes basing this belief on asexuals who masturbate or occasionally engage in sexual activity simply to please a romantic partner.&lt;ref name="Sexual orientation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bridgeman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="More to life"/&gt; Within the context of sexual orientation identity politics, asexuality may pragmatically fulfill the political function of a sexual orientation identity category.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The suggestion that asexuality is a sexual dysfunction is controversial among the asexual community. Those who identify as asexual usually prefer it to be recognized as a sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Sex and society"/&gt; Various scholars state that asexuality is a sexual orientation, as some asexuals are unable to masturbate even though they reportedly have a normal sex drive, and that there are variations of sexual preferences, arguing that asexuality ought to be included as well.&lt;ref name="Sexual orientation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Halter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="More to life"/&gt; They and many asexual people believe that the lack of sexual attraction is valid enough to be categorized as a sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Decker, Julie Sondra (2014). ''The Invisible Orientation: an Introduction to Asexuality''. New York: Carrel Books.&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers argue that asexuals do not choose to have no sexual desire, and generally start to find out their differences in sexual behaviors around adolescence. Because of these facts coming to light, it is reasoned that asexuality is more than a behavioral choice and is not something that can be cured like a disorder.&lt;ref name="More to life"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Koukounas"&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Over | first1= Ray | last2 = Koukounas | first2= Eric | year= 1995 | title = Habituation of Sexual Arousal: Product and Process | journal= Annual Review of Sex Research | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 187–223 | doi= 10.1080/10532528.1995.10559905 | postscript= &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;See [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10532528.1995.10559905 here] | doi-broken-date= 2018-10-14 }}&lt;br /&gt;Cited from: {{cite book |last= Kelly |first= Gary F. |authorlink = |title=Sexuality Today: The Human Perspective |edition= 7 |year=2004 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |isbn=978-0-07-255835-7 |page=401}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also analysis on whether asexuality is becoming more popular, with more people identifying as asexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Doug|title=The Disregarding of Heteronormativity: Emphasizing a Happy Queer Adulthood and Localizing Anti-Queer Violence to Adolescent Schools|journal=Sexuality Research &amp; Social Policy|volume=14|issue=3|pages=331–344|doi=10.1007/s13178-016-0272-7|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on the etiology of sexual orientation when applied to asexuality has the definitional problem of sexual orientation not consistently being defined by researchers as including asexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | pmid = 19955753 | doi=10.1159/000262525 | volume=17 | title=Sexual hormones and the brain: an essential alliance for sexual identity and sexual orientation | year=2010 | journal=Endocr Dev | pages=22–35 | last1 = Garcia-Falgueras | first1 = A | last2 = Swaab | first2 = DF| series=Endocrine Development | isbn=978-3-8055-9302-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual orientation is defined as "enduring" and resistant to change, proving to be generally impervious to interventions intended to change it,&lt;ref name="apahelp"/&gt; and asexuality may be defined as a sexual orientation because it is enduring and consistent over time.&lt;ref name="Helm"/&gt; While heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality are usually, but not always, determined during the early years of preadolescent life, it is not known when asexuality is determined. "It is unclear whether these characteristics [''viz.'', "lacking interest in or desire for sex"] are thought to be lifelong, or if they may be acquired."&lt;ref name="Prause"/&gt;

=== Sexual activity and sexuality ===
While some asexuals masturbate as a solitary form of release or have sex for the benefit of a romantic partner, others do not ([[#Definition, identity and relationships|see above]]).&lt;ref name="Prause"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cerankowski and Milks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New Scientist"/&gt;  Fischer et al. reported that "scholars who study the physiology around asexuality suggest that people who are asexual are capable of genital arousal but may experience difficulty with so-called subjective arousal." This means that "while the body becomes aroused, subjectively – at the level of the mind and emotions – one does not experience arousal".&lt;ref name="Fischer"/&gt;

The [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction|Kinsey Institute]] sponsored another small survey on the topic in 2007, which found that self-identified asexuals "reported significantly less desire for sex with a partner, lower sexual arousability, and lower sexual excitation but did not differ consistently from non-asexuals in their sexual inhibition scores or their desire to masturbate".&lt;ref name="Prause" /&gt;

A 1977 paper titled ''Asexual and Autoerotic Women: Two Invisible Groups'', by Myra T. Johnson, is explicitly devoted to asexuality in humans.&lt;ref name="Cerankowski and Milks 3"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karli June Cerankowski |author2=Megan Milks|title=Asexualities: Feminist and Queer Perspectives|isbn=978-1-134-69253-8|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2014|page=244|accessdate=January 4, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XbgTAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson defines asexuals as those men and women "who, regardless of physical or emotional condition, actual sexual history, and marital status or ideological orientation, seem to ''prefer'' not to engage in sexual activity." She contrasts [[Autoeroticism|autoerotic]] women with asexual women: "The asexual woman&amp;nbsp;... has no sexual desires at all [but] the autoerotic woman&amp;nbsp;... recognizes such desires but prefers to satisfy them alone." Johnson's evidence is mostly letters to the editor found in women's magazines written by asexual/autoerotic women. She portrays them as invisible, "oppressed by a consensus that they are nonexistent," and left behind by both the sexual revolution and the feminist movement. Johnson argued that society either ignores or denies their existence or insists they must be ascetic for religious reasons, neurotic, or asexual for political reasons.&lt;ref name="Cerankowski and Milks 3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Asexual and Autoerotic Women: Two Invisible Groups" found in ed.

In a study published in 1979 in volume five of ''Advances in the Study of Affect'', as well as in another article using the same data and published in 1980 in the ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]'', Michael D. Storms of the [[University of Kansas]] outlined his own reimagining of the Kinsey scale. Whereas Kinsey measured sexual orientation based on a combination of actual sexual behavior and fantasizing and eroticism, Storms used only fantasizing and eroticism. Storms, however, placed hetero-eroticism and homo-eroticism on separate axes rather than at two ends of a single scale; this allows for a distinction between bisexuality (exhibiting both hetero- and homo-eroticism in degrees comparable to hetero- or homosexuals, respectively) and asexuality (exhibiting a level of homo-eroticism comparable to a heterosexual and a level of hetero-eroticism comparable to a homosexual, namely, little to none). This type of scale accounted for asexuality for the first time.&lt;ref name="Cerankowski and Milks 4"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karli June Cerankowski |author2=Megan Milks|title=Asexualities: Feminist and Queer Perspectives|isbn=978-1-134-69253-8|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2014|page=113|accessdate=January 4, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XbgTAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storms conjectured that many researchers following Kinsey's model could be mis-categorizing asexual subjects as bisexual, because both were simply defined by a lack of preference for gender in sexual partners.&lt;ref name = Storms1980&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.38.5.783 | last1 = Storms | first1 = Michael D. | year = 1980 | title = Theories of Sexual Orientation | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 38 | issue = 5| pages = 783–792 | url = http://www.williamapercy.com/wiki/images/Theories_of_sexual_orientation.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Storms1979&gt;Storms, M.&amp;nbsp;D.

In a 1983 study by Paula Nurius, which included 689 subjects (most of whom were students at various universities in the United States taking psychology or sociology classes), the two-dimensional fantasizing and eroticism scale was used to measure sexual orientation. Based on the results, respondents were given a score ranging from 0 to 100 for hetero-eroticism and from 0 to 100 for homo-eroticism. Respondents who scored lower than 10 on both were labeled "asexual". This consisted of 5% of the males and 10% of the females. Results showed that asexuals reported much lower frequency and desired frequency of a variety of sexual activities including having multiple partners, anal sexual activities, having sexual encounters in a variety of locations, and autoerotic activities.&lt;ref name="Ruspini"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nurius"/&gt;

=== Feminist research ===
A 2010 paper written by [[Karli June Cerankowski]] and Megan Milks, titled ''New Orientations: Asexuality and Its Implications for Theory and Practice'', suggests that asexuality may be somewhat of a question in itself for the studies of gender and sexuality.&lt;ref name="Hultquist"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Aleksondra Hultquist |author2=Elizabeth J. Mathews|title=New Perspectives on Delarivier Manley and Eighteenth Century Literature: Power, Sex, and Text|isbn=978-1317196921|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2016|page=123|accessdate=January 4, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lDGTDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cerankowski and Milks have suggested that asexuality raises many more questions than it resolves, such as how a person could abstain from having sex, which is generally accepted by society to be the most basic of instincts.&lt;ref name="Cerankowski and Milks 5"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karli June Cerankowski |author2=Megan Milks|title=Asexualities: Feminist and Queer Perspectives|isbn=978-1-134-69253-8|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2014|pages=1–410|accessdate=January 4, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XbgTAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their ''New Orientations'' paper states that society has deemed "[LGBT and] female sexuality as empowered or repressed. The asexual movement challenges that assumption by challenging many of the basic tenets of [[pro-sex feminism]] [in which it is] already defined as repressive or anti-sex sexualities." In addition to accepting self-identification as asexual, the Asexual Visibility and Education Network has formulated asexuality as a biologically-determined orientation. This formula, if dissected scientifically and proven, would support researcher [[Simon LeVay]]'s blind study of the [[hypothalamus]] in gay men, women, and straight men, which indicates that there is a biological difference between straight men and gay men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Myers|first=David G.|title=Psychology|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4292-1597-8|page=474|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Cerankowski and Milks edited and published ''Asexualities: Feminist and Queer Perspectives'', a collection of essays intended to explore the politics of asexuality from a feminist and queer perspective.&lt;ref name="Cerankowski and Milks 5"/&gt; It is broken into the introduction and then six parts: Theorizing Asexuality: New Orientations; The Politics of Asexuality; Visualizing Asexuality in Media Culture; Asexuality and Masculinity; Health, Disability, and Medicalization; and Reading Asexually: Asexual Literary Theory. Each part contains two to three papers on a given aspect of asexuality research. One such paper is written by Ela Przybylo, another name that is becoming common in asexual scholarly literature. Her article, with regard to the Cerankowski and Milks anthology, focuses on accounts by self-identified male asexuals, with a particular focus on the pressures men experience towards having sex in dominant Western discourse and media. Three men living in Southern Ontario, Canada, were interviewed in 2011, and Przybylo admits that the small sample-size means that her findings cannot be generalized to a greater population in terms of representation, and that they are "exploratory and provisional", especially in a field that is still lacking in theorizations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Przybylo, Ela. "Masculine Doubt and Sexual Wonder: Asexually-Identified Men Talk About Their (A)sexualities" from Karli June Cerankowski and Megan Milks, eds., ''Asexualities: Feminist and Queer Perspectives'' (Routledge, 2014), 225-246.&lt;/ref&gt; All three interviewees addressed being affected by the stereotype that men have to enjoy and want sex in order to be "real men".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Another of Przybylo's works, ''Asexuality and the Feminist Politics of "Not Doing It"'', published in 2011, takes a feminist lens to scientific writings on asexuality. Pryzyblo argues that asexuality is made possible only through the Western context of "sexual, coital, and heterosexual imperatives".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Przybylo |first=Ela |year=2011 |title=Asexuality and the Feminist Politics of "Not Doing It" |degree=MA |location=Edmonton, Alberta |publisher=University of Alberta |doi=10.7939/R3RB04 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; She addresses earlier works by [[Dana Densmore]], Valerie Solanas, and Breanne Fahs, who argued for "asexuality and celibacy" as radical feminist political strategies against patriarchy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While Przybylo does make some distinctions between asexuality and celibacy, she considers blurring the lines between the two to be productive for a feminist understanding of the topic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In her 2013 article, "Producing Facts: Empirical Asexuality and the Scientific Study of Sex", Przybylo distinguishes between two different stages of asexual research - that of the late 1970s to the early 1990s, which often included a very limited understanding of asexuality, and the more recent revisiting of the subject which she says began with Bogaert's 2004 study ([[#Prevalence|see above]]) and has popularized the subject and made it more "culturally visible". In this article, Przybylo once again asserts the understanding of asexuality as a cultural phenomenon, and continues to be critical of its scientific study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Przybylo | first1 = Ela | year = 2013 | title = Producing Facts: Empirical Asexuality and the Scientific Study of Sex | url = | journal = Feminism &amp; Psychology | volume = 23 | issue = 2| pages = 224–242 | doi = 10.1177/0959353512443668 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CJ DeLuzio Chasin states in ''Reconsidering Asexuality and Its Radical Potential'' that academic research on asexuality "has positioned asexuality in line with [[Essentialism|essentialist]] discourses of sexual orientation" which is troublesome as it creates a [[Binary opposition|binary]] between asexuals and persons who have been subjected to psychiatric intervention for disorders such as Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder.&lt;ref name="Reconsidering Asexuality" /&gt; Chasin says that this binary implies that all asexuals experience a lifelong (hence, enduring) lack of sexual attraction, that all non-asexuals who experience a lack of sexual desire experience distress over it, and that it pathologizes asexuals who do experience such distress.&lt;ref name="Reconsidering Asexuality" /&gt; As Chasin says such diagnoses as HSDD act to medicalize and govern women's sexuality, the article aims to "unpack" problematic definitions of asexuality that are harmful to both asexuals and women alike. Chasin states that asexuality has the power to challenge commonplace discourse of the naturalness of sexuality, but that the unquestioned acceptance of its current definition does not allow for this. Chasin also argues there and elsewhere in ''Making Sense in and of the Asexual Community: Navigating Relationships and Identities in a Context of Resistance'' that is important to interrogate why someone might be distressed about low sexual desire. Chasin further argues that clinicians have an ethical obligation to avoid treating low sexual desire per se as pathological, and to discuss asexuality as a viable possibility (where relevant) with clients presenting clinically with low sexual desire.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Bogaert's psychological work and theories ===
Bogaert argues that understanding asexuality is of key importance to understanding sexuality in general.&lt;ref name="bogaert2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bogaert |first1=A. F. | year = 2015 | title = Asexuality: What It Is and Why It Matters | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 362–379 | doi = 10.1080/00224499.2015.1015713|pmid=25897566 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his work, Bogaert defines asexuality as "a lack of lustful inclinations/feelings directed toward others," a definition that he argues is relatively new in light of recent theory and empirical work on sexual orientation. This definition of ''asexuality'' also makes clear this distinction between behavior and desire, for both asexuality and celibacy, although Bogaert also notes that there is some evidence of reduced sexual activity for those who fit this definition. He further distinguishes between desire for others and desire for sexual stimulation, the latter of which is not always absent for those who identify as asexual, although he acknowledges that other theorists define asexuality differently and that further research needs to be done on the "complex relationship between attraction and desire".&lt;ref name="bogaert2015" /&gt; Another distinction is made between romantic and sexual attraction, and he draws on work from [[developmental psychology]], which suggests that romantic systems derive from [[attachment theory]] while sexual systems "primarily reside in different brain structures".&lt;ref name="bogaert2015" /&gt;

Concurrent with Bogaert's suggestion that understanding asexuality will lead to a better understanding of sexuality overall, he discusses the topic of asexual masturbation to theorize on asexuals and "'target-oriented' [[paraphilia]], in which there is an inversion, reversal, or disconnection between the self and the typical target/object of sexual interest/attraction" (such as attraction to oneself, labelled "automonosexualism").&lt;ref name="bogaert2015" /&gt;

In an earlier 2006 article, Bogaert acknowledges that a distinction between behavior and attraction has been accepted into recent conceptualizations of sexual orientation, which aids in positioning asexuality as such.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bogaert | first1 = Anthony F | year = 2006 | title = Toward a Conceptual Understanding of Asexuality | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 241–250 | doi = 10.1037/1089-2680.10.3.241}}&lt;/ref&gt; He adds that, by this framework, "(subjective) sexual attraction is the psychological core of sexual orientation", and also addresses that there may be "some skepticism in [both] the academic and clinical communities" about classifying asexuality as a sexual orientation, and that it raises two objections to such a classification: First, he suggests that there could be an issue with self-reporting (i.e., "a 'perceived' or 'reported' lack of attraction", particularly for definitions of sexual orientation that consider physical arousal over subjective attraction), and, second, he raises the issue of overlap between absent and ''very'' ''low'' sexual desire, as those with an extremely low desire may still have an "underlying sexual orientation" despite potentially identifying as asexual.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

For some, being a part of a community is an important resource because they often report having felt ostracized.&lt;ref name="Padraig"/&gt; Although online communities exist, affiliation with online communities vary. Some question the concept of online community, while others depend on the online asexual community heavily for support. [[Elizabeth Abbott]] posits that there has always been an asexual element in the population, but that asexual people kept a low profile. While the failure to consummate marriage was seen as an insult to the sacrament of marriage in medieval Europe, and has sometimes been used as grounds for divorce or to rule a marriage void, asexuality, unlike homosexuality, has never been illegal, and it has usually gone unnoticed. However, in the 21st century, the anonymity of online communication and general popularity of [[social network]]ing online has facilitated the formation of a community built around a common asexual identity.&lt;ref name="Duenwald"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Mary|last=Duenwald|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/09/fashion/thursdaystyles/09asexual.html |title=For Them, Just Saying No Is Easy|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 9, 2005|accessdate=17 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communities such as AVEN can be beneficial to those in search of answers to solve a crisis of identity with regard to their possible asexuality. Individuals go through a series of emotional processes that end with their identifying with the asexual community. They first realize that their sexual attractions differ from those of most of society. This difference leads to questioning whether the way they feel is acceptable, and possible reasons for why they feel this way. [[Pathology|Pathological]] beliefs tend to follow, in which, in some cases, they may seek medical help because they feel they have a disease. Self-understanding is usually reached when they find a definition that matches their feelings. Asexuality communities provide support and information that allows newly identified asexuals to move from self-clarification to identifying on a communal level, which can be empowering, because they now have something to associate with, which gives normality to this overall socially-isolating situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/1363460711406462 | last1 = Carrigan | first1 = Mark | year = 2011 | title = There's more to life than sex?

Asexual organizations and other Internet resources play a key role in informing people about asexuality. The lack of research makes it difficult for doctors to understand the causation. Like with any sexual orientation, most people who are asexual are self-identified. This can be a problem when asexuality is mistaken for an intimacy or relationship problem or for other symptoms that do not define asexuality. There is also a significant population that either does not understand or does not believe in asexuality, which adds to the importance of these organizations to inform the general population; however, due to the lack of scientific fact on the subject, what these groups promote as information is often questioned.

On June 29, 2014, AVEN organized the second International Asexuality Conference, as an affiliate WorldPride event in Toronto. The first was held at the 2012 World Pride in London.&lt;ref name="Tarrant2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shira Tarrant|title=Gender, Sex, and Politics: In the Streets and Between the Sheets in the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6nwCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT278|date=June 19, 2015|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-81475-7|pages=278–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second such event, which was attended by around 250 people, was the largest gathering of asexuals to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/06/23/world_pride_toronto_asexuals_march_in_biggest_numbers_yet.html|title=World Pride Toronto: Asexuals march in biggest numbers yet|work=thestar.com|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference included presentations, discussions, and workshops on topics such as research on asexuality, asexual relationships, and intersecting identities.

=== Symbols ===
{{Main|LGBT symbols}}In 2009, AVEN members participated in the first asexual entry into an American pride parade when they walked in the [[San Francisco Pride Parade]].&lt;ref name="Rufus"&gt;{{cite web|first=Rufus|last=Anneli|title= Stuck.

The final flag had been a popular candidate and had previously seen use in online forums outside of AVEN. The final vote was held on a survey system outside of AVEN where the main flag creation efforts were organized. The flag colors have been used in artwork and referenced in articles about asexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recultured.com/uncategorized/09/asexuality-redefining-love-and-sexuality/ |title=Asexuality – Redefining Love and Sexuality |publisher=recultured |date=9 January 2012 |accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flag consists of four horizontal stripes: black, grey, white, and purple from top to bottom.

Asexual Awareness Week occurs in the later half of October, and is created to celebrate and bring awareness to asexuality (including gray asexuality).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/brunch/meet-india-s-newest-sexual-minority-the-asexuals/story-pNyerWTWrBnJHFqpkPwrIP.html|title=Meet India’s newest sexual minority: The asexuals|last=Kumar|first=Shikha|date=2017-03-18|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|access-date=2017-09-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asexualawarenessweek.com/about.html|title=AAW – About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=asexualawarenessweek.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2016-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by Sara Beth Brooks in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/robyn-exton/aces-show-their-hand-what_b_12915544.html|title=Aces Show Their Hand – What Is Asexuality And Why You Should Know About It|last=Exton|first=Robyn|date=2016-11-14|website=HuffPost UK|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asexualawarenessweek.com/prerelease/About.html|title=About [prerelease]|last=|first=|date=|website=asexualawarenessweek.com|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion ==
Studies have found no significant statistical correlation between religion and asexuality,&lt;ref name="Aicken"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aicken|first1=Catherine R.&amp;nbsp;H.|last2=Mercer|first2=Catherine H.|last3=Cassell|first3=Jackie A.|editor1-last=Carrigan|editor1-first=Mark|editor2-last=Gupta|editor2-first=Kristina|editor3-last=Morrison|editor3-first=Todd G.|article=Who reports absence of sexual attraction in Britain?

Because of the relatively recent application of the term ''asexuality'', most religions do not have clear stances on it.&lt;ref name="AsexualityandChristianity"&gt;{{cite web|title=Asexuality and Christianity|url=http://asexualawarenessweek.com/docs/PRIDE-Asexuality-and-Christianity.pdf|website=asexualawarenessweek.com|publisher=Asexual Awareness Week|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In {{Bibleverse||Matthew|19:11-12|9}}, [[Jesus]] mentions "For there are [[eunuch]]s who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others – and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs to the sake of the [[Kingdom of Heaven (Gospel of Matthew)|kingdom of heaven]]."&lt;ref name="Kaoma"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaoma|first=Kapya|date=2018|title=Christianity, Globalization, and Protective Homophobia: Democratic Contestation of Sexuality in Sub-Saharan Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xSU_DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-3-319-66341-8|pages=159–160|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[biblical hermeneutics|biblical exegetes]] have interpreted the "eunuchs who were born that way" as including asexuals.&lt;ref name="Kaoma"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=William Graham|title=Sex in Christianity and Psychoanalysis|date=2015|orig-year=1955|series=Routledge Library Editions: Psychoanalysis|publisher=Routledge|location=New York City, New York and London, England|isbn=978-1138951792|page=177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaLhCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA177|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity has traditionally revered celibacy (which is not the same as asexuality);&lt;ref name="AsexualityandChristianity"/&gt; the apostle [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], a lifelong unmarried celibate, has been described by some writers as asexual.&lt;ref name="AsexualityandChristianity"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zuckerman|first1=Phil|title=An Invitation to Sociology of Religion|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=New York City, New York and London, England|isbn=978-0-415-94125-9|page=111|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ml6TAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA111|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He writes in {{Bibleverse||1 Corinthians|7:6-9|9}},
{{quote|I wish that all men were as I am. But each man has his own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that.

But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.&lt;ref name="AsexualityandChristianity"/&gt;}}
Nonetheless, some Christians regard asexuality as imaginary or even immoral.&lt;ref name="AsexualityandChristianity"/&gt; The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priests David Nantais and Scott Opperman write: "Asexual people do not exist. Sexuality is a gift from God and thus a fundamental part of our human identity. Those who repress their sexuality are not living as God created them to be: fully alive and well. As such, they're most likely unhappy."&lt;ref name="AsexualityandChristianity"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Natais|first1=David|last2=Opperman|first2=Scott|title=Eight myths about religious life|url=https://www.vocationnetwork.org/en/articles/show/49|website=vocationnetwork.org|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discrimination and legal protections ==
[[File:WorldPride 2012 - 175.jpg|alt=|thumb|Asexuals marching in a pride parade]]
A 2012 study published in ''[[Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations]]'' reported that asexuals are evaluated more negatively in terms of [[prejudice]], [[dehumanization]] and [[discrimination]] than other [[Sexual minority|sexual minorities]], such as gay men, lesbians and bisexuals. Both homosexual and heterosexual people thought of asexuals as not only cold, but also animalistic and unrestrained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Intergroup bias toward "Group X": Evidence of prejudice, dehumanization, avoidance, and discrimination against asexuals |first1=Cara C. |last1=MacInnis |first2=Gordon |last2=Hodson |journal=Group Processes Intergroup Relations |doi=10.1177/1368430212442419 |volume=15 |number=6 |pages=725–743 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different study, however, found little evidence of serious discrimination against asexuals because of their asexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Gazzola, Stephanie B, and Melanie A.

[[Gilligan (Gilligan's Island)|Gilligan]], the [[eponym]]ous character of the 1960s television series ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', would today be classified as asexual.&lt;ref name="Bogaert"/&gt; The producers of the show likely portrayed him in this way to make him more relatable to young male viewers of the show who had not yet reached puberty and had therefore presumably not yet experienced sexual desire.&lt;ref name="Bogaert"/&gt; Gilligan's asexual nature also allowed the producers to orchestrate intentionally comedic situations in which Gilligan spurns the advances of attractive females.&lt;ref name="Bogaert"/&gt; Movies and television frequently feature attractive, but seemingly asexual, female characters who are "converted" to heterosexuality by the male protagonist by the end of the production.&lt;ref name="Bogaert"/&gt; These unrealistic portrayals reflect a heterosexual male belief that all asexual women secretly desire men.&lt;ref name="Bogaert"/&gt;

Asexuality as a sexual identity, rather than as a biological entity, became more widely discussed in the media in the beginning of the twenty-first century.&lt;ref name="Kelemen"/&gt; The [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] series ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' represented an "asexual" couple in the episode "[[Better Half (House)|Better Half]]". However, this representation has been questioned by members of the asexual community (including AVEN founder, David Jay) due to the episode concluding in the reveal that the man simply had a pituitary tumor that reduced his sex drive, and the woman was only pretending to be asexual to please him.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/01/31/house_gets_asexuality_wrong/|title="House" gets asexuality wrong|last=Clark-Flory|first=Tracy|date=January 31, 2012|website=salon|access-date=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to controversy over the representation and a change.org petition for Fox Network to reconsider how it represents asexual characters in the future, stating it "represented asexuality very poorly by attributing it to both medical illness and deception."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The [[Netflix]] series ''[[BoJack Horseman]]'' revealed in the end of the third season that Todd Chavez, one of the primary characters, is asexual.
