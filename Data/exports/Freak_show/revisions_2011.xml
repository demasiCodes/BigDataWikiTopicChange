{{Disability}}[[Image:Coney2008.jpg|thumb|[[Coney Island]] and its popular on-going freak show.]]
A '''freak show''' is an exhibition of biological rarities, referred to as "freaks of nature".  Typical features would be physically unusual humans, such as those uncommonly large or small, those with [[intersexuality|both male and female secondary sexual characteristics]], people with other extraordinary diseases and conditions, and performances that are expected to be shocking to the viewers. Heavily [[tattoo]]ed or [[body piercing|pierced]] people have sometimes been seen in freak shows, as have attention-getting physical performers such as [[fire eater|fire-eating]] and [[Sword swallowing|sword-swallowing]] acts.

==History==
[[Image:Freak show 1941.jpg|left|thumb|A freak show in [[Rutland (city), Vermont|Rutland, Vermont]] in 1941.]]

Freak shows were popular in the United States from the mid 19th to mid 20th centuries, and were often, but not always, associated with [[circus]]es and [[Traveling carnival|carnivals]]. Some shows also exhibited deformed animals (such as two-headed cows, one-eyed pigs, and four-horned goats) and famous hoaxes, or simply "science gone wrong" exhibits (such as deformed babies).

Changes in popular culture and entertainment, and changing attitudes about physical differences, led to the decline of the freak show as a form of entertainment. As previously mysterious anomalies were scientifically explained as [[genetic mutations]] or [[diseases]], freaks became the objects of sympathy rather than fear or disdain.  Laws were passed restricting freak shows for these reasons.  For example, [[Michigan]] law forbids the "exhibition [of] any deformed human being or human monstrosity, except as used for scientific purposes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(sqktze55ua0uru45dvse3qv0)/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&amp;objectName=mcl-750-347 Michigan Penal Code (Excerpt), Act 328 of 1931: Section 750.347, Deformed human beings; exhibition.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in many places freak shows are still popular features.

==Historical timeline==
The exhibition of human oddities has a long history:

;1932: [[Tod Browning]]'s [[Pre-Code]]-[[era]] [[film]] ''[[Freaks]]'' tells the story of a traveling freakshow. The use of real freaks in the film provoked public outcries, and the film was relegated to obscurity until its re-release at the 1962 [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missinglinkclassichorror.co.uk/freaks.htm Missing Link reviews Tod Browning's ''Freaks'' (1932)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern freak shows==
[[Image:LobsterBoy.jpg|thumb|Lobster Boy known as the Black Scorpion.]]
The entertainment appeal of the traditional "freak shows" is arguably echoed in numerous programmes made for television. Thus ''[[Extraordinary People (2005 TV series)|Extraordinary People]]'' on the British television channel [[Five (TV channel)|Five]] or [[BodyShock]] show the life of severely disabled or deformed people, and can be seen as the modern equivalent of the circus freak shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Logged in as click here to log out |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/tvandradioblog/2008/feb/21/lastnightstvextraordinaryp |title=Last night's TV: Extraordinary People: The Boys Joined at the Head &amp;#124; Media |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2008-02-21|accessdate=2009-04-13 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article1509917.ece |title=Last Night's TV - Times Online |publisher=Entertainment.timesonline.co.uk |date= 2007-03-14|accessdate=2009-04-13 | location=London | first=Kevin | last=Maher}}&lt;/ref&gt; However in order to make the shows respectable, the subjects are usually portrayed as heroic and attention is given to their family and friends and the way they help them overcome their disabilities. On ''[[The Guardian]]'', Chris Shaw however comments that "one man's freak show is another man's portrayal of heroic triumph over medical adversity" and carries on with "call me prejudiced but I suspect your typical twentysomething watched this show with their jaw on the floor rather than a tear in their eye".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/feb/20/broadcasting.comment |title=The lure of the weird &amp;#124; Media &amp;#124; MediaGuardian |publisher=Guardian |date= 2006-02-20|accessdate=2009-04-13 | location=London | first=Chris | last=Shaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;
