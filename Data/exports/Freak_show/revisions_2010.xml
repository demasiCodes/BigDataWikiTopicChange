{{Disability}}[[Image:Coney2008.jpg|thumb|[[Coney Island]] and its popular on-going freak show.]]
A '''freak show''' is an exhibition of rarities, "freaks of nature" — such as unusually tall or short humans, and people with [[intersexuality|both male and female secondary sexual characteristics]] or other extraordinary diseases and conditions — and performances that are expected to be shocking to the viewers. Heavily [[tattoo]]ed or [[body piercing|pierced]] people have sometimes been seen in freak shows, as have [[fire eater|fire-eating]] and [[Sword swallowing|sword-swallowing]] acts. 

==History==
[[Image:Freak show 1941.jpg|left|thumb|A freak show in [[Rutland (city), Vermont|Rutland, Vermont]] in 1941.]]

Freak shows were popular in the United States from around 1840 to the 1970s, and were often, but not always, associated with [[circus]]es and [[Traveling carnival|carnivals]]. Some shows also exhibited deformed animals (such as two-headed cows, one-eyed pigs, and four-horned goats) and famous hoaxes, or simply "science gone wrong" exhibits (such as deformed babies). 

Changes in popular culture and entertainment led to the decline of the freak show as a form of entertainment. As previously mysterious anomalies were scientifically explained as [[genetic mutations]] or [[diseases]], freaks became the objects of sympathy rather than fear or disdain.

Today, [[Michigan]] law forbids the "exhibition [of] any deformed human being or human monstrosity, except as used for scientific purposes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(sqktze55ua0uru45dvse3qv0)/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&amp;objectName=mcl-750-347 Michigan Penal Code (Excerpt), Act 328 of 1931: Section 750.347, Deformed human beings; exhibition.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in many states in the USA and in other countries abroad, one can still see freak shows at carnivals and state fairs, in bars and nightclubs, and on daytime television talk shows.

==Historical timeline==
The exhibition of human oddities has a long history:

;1932: [[Tod Browning]]'s [[Pre-Code]]-[[era]] [[film]] ''[[Freaks]]'' tells the story of a traveling freakshow.

;2005: "999 Eyes Freakshow" founded, touting itself as the "last genuine traveling freakshow in the United States." 999 Eyes portrays freaks in a very positive light, insisting that "what is different is beautiful."

==Modern freak shows==

The entertainment appeal of the traditional "freak shows" is arguably echoed in numerous programmes made for television. Thus [[Extraordinary People (2005 TV series)|Extraordinary People]] on the British television channel [[Five (TV channel)|Five]] or [[BodyShock]] show the life of severely disabled or deformed people, and can be seen as the modern equivalent of the circus freak shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Logged in as click here to log out |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/tvandradioblog/2008/feb/21/lastnightstvextraordinaryp |title=Last night's TV: Extraordinary People: The Boys Joined at the Head &amp;#124; Media |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2008-02-21|accessdate=2009-04-13 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article1509917.ece |title=Last Night's TV - Times Online |publisher=Entertainment.timesonline.co.uk |date= 2007-03-14|accessdate=2009-04-13 | location=London | first=Kevin | last=Maher}}&lt;/ref&gt; However in order to make the shows respectable, the subjects are usually portrayed as heroic and attention is given to their family and friends and the way they help them overcome their disabilities. On [[The Guardian]], Chris Shaw however comments that "one man's freak show is another man's portrayal of heroic triumph over medical adversity" and carry on with "call me prejudiced but I suspect your typical twentysomething watched this show with their jaw on the floor rather than a tear in their eye".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/feb/20/broadcasting.comment |title=The lure of the weird &amp;#124; Media &amp;#124; MediaGuardian |publisher=Guardian |date= 2006-02-20|accessdate=2009-04-13 | location=London | first=Chris | last=Shaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;
