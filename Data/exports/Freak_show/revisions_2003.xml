Heavily [[tattoo]]ed people have sometimes been seen in freak shows, as have [[fire eater|fire-eating]] and [[sword swallower|sword-swallowing]] acts.

Freak shows have often been associated with [[circus]]es and [[amusement park]]s. One of the last remaining freak shows in the United States is in [[Coney Island]].</rev></revisions></page></pages></query></api>
