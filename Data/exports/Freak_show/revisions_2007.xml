[[Image:FreakShowConeyIsland.jpg|thumb|[[Coney Island]] and its popular on-going freak show.]]
A '''freak show''' is an exhibition of rarities, "freaks of nature" — such as unusually tall or short humans, and people with [[intersexuality|both male and female secondary sexual characteristics]] — and performances that are expected to be shocking to the viewers. Heavily [[tattoo]]ed or [[body piercing|pierced]] people have sometimes been seen in freak shows, as have [[fire eater|fire-eating]] and [[Sword swallowing|sword-swallowing]] acts.

==History==

Freak shows were popular in the United States from around 1840 to 1940, and were often, but not always, associated with [[circus]]es and [[carnival]]s. Some shows also exhibited deformed animals (such as two-headed cows, one-eyed pigs, and four-horned goats), famous hoaxes, or simply "science gone wrong" exhibits (such as deformed babies). A recent example of this style of freak show is called The [[Venice Beach Freakshow]] which is located in Venice, California. This attraction houses a huge collection of freaks and strange oddities. The owner claims that it has the largest collection of two-headed animals in the world.

Advances in [[medicine]] and political changes all but sounded the [[wiktionary:death knell|death knell]] for the freak show. As previously mysterious anomalies were scientifically explained as [[genetic mutations]] or [[diseases]], freaks became the objects of pity rather than fear or disdain. The [[eugenics]] movement saw human anomalies as unfortunate mistakes of nature. In [[1937]], [[Germany]] passed a law outlawing freak shows, decrying them as exploitation (this however made it legal  for the [pro-eugenics] [[Nazis]] to arrest freakshow acts and experiment on them{{Fact|date=August 2007}}). 

Thus the term "freak show" has become archaic and widely seen as [[pejorative]]; shows such as [[Jim Rose Circus]] sideshow, and those at [[Coney Island]] are more acurately termed [[sideshow]]s. However, [[Cut Throat Freak Show]] still uses the term, as do many other self proclaimed freak and [[sideshow]] performers.  The only show that still uses the term "freak" to mean real living human oddities is the 999 eyes.

Today, freak shows are outlawed in a number of U.S. states.  For example, Michigan law forbids the "exhibition [of] any deformed human being or human monstrosity, except as used for scientific purposes".

==Today==

Freak shows are extremely rare today, often reduced to [[museum]] displays containing newspaper clippings, photographs, statues, and other memorabilia of the freak shows of earlier times.

The Only authentic freak show currently traveling in the USA (2005-2007) with born living human oddities and medical anomalies is the 999 Eyes of Endless Dream Carnival Museum &amp; Sideshow.  This show features people born with medical anomalies such as the Black Scorpion aka Lobster Bro, Jackie the Half Girl, Peg Leg the Modern-Day Elephant Man, Lobster Girl, and the Dame Demure Madame Miniature along with a museum that includes [[pickled punks]] and many items from John Strong's collection, including Patches a stuffed [[polycephaly|two-headed calf]].

Although widely referred to as freaks, a distinction must be made between self-made freaks and born freaks. Generally, the most extreme examples of self-made freaks are referred to as "Human Marvels". [[Katzen]], [[The Enigma (person)|The Enigma]], [[The Lizardman]] and both the Scottish and Texan Leopard men are all human marvels. 

With the rise of the [[Internet]], the freak show mentality has been given a new lease on life as sites such as [[rotten.com]] arose, allowing people to gaze at "freakish"  abnormalities that would not have been seen during the [[television]] era due to ideas about aesthetic [[taste (sociology)|taste]]. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==A historical timeline of the Freakshow== 

The exhibition of human oddities seen as far back as recorded history - we start in the year 1738.

'''1738''' - The exhibition of an exhibit who "was taken in a wook at Guinea; 'tis a female about four feet high in every part like a woman excepting her head which nearly resembles the ape."

By the late 18th century, the science of [[teratology]] changed the belief that freaks were evil omens and the work of Satan or witches.  Instead, people believed the theory that freaks were part of God's great order of creatures.

'''1822''' - The [[Fiji mermaid|FeeJee Mermaid]] is discovered in Indonesia by Captain Eades.

'''1829''' - [[Chang and Eng Bunker|Chang and Eng]] “the original [[conjoined twins|Siamese twins]]” were exhibited in America.

'''1839''' - J.G. Milligan writes “curiosities of medical experiments” in which freaks are described.

'''1844''' - [[P. T. Barnum]] arrives in London to exhibit [[General Tom Thumb|Tom Thumb]], the famous midget.

'''1860''' - Hiram and Barney Davis are presented as [[Wild Men of Borneo]].  The guide book for Barnum American museum list 13 human curiosities.  [[Zip the Pinhead]] begins his six-decade career with Barnum.

'''1863''' - Barnum uses his brilliant showman skills to get the civil war and emancipation proclamation pushed off the front pages and replaced by a midget wedding.

'''1870-1890''' - [[Dime museum]]s are at the height of their popularity, with the freakshow as the main attraction.

'''1876''' - Wild men of Borneo, wild Australian children, man-eating FeeJee Mermaids and the 602lb woman are exhibited at the first [[World’s Fair]] in Philadelphia.

'''1880''' - First freakshow at [[Coney Island]].

'''1883''' - Coney Island freakshow debuts Henrietta 'Nose Javelin' Whitfield. Many believe her to be the ugliest beast freak that ever lived. Her hag head and witchcraft led to her execution in 1897.

'''1884''' - Freak recruiting becomes a career and full time occupation.

'''1889''' - British medical journal describes [[Myrtle Corbin]], the "four-legged girl," and verifies that both sets of reproductive organs as workable and capable of birthing children.

'''1890''' - The Jones twins, Siamese twins joined at buttocks and sharing a rectum die on carnival tour at fifteen months old.

'''1896''' - Moral outrage sweeps Britain as Maxine Proctor, a creature described as [[The Elephant Man]] meets [[Helen Keller]] tours the country. Petitions to ban freakshows ride high on the tide of indignant fear, and many venues refuse to allow the "Hellish" Proctor on their bills.

Latter part of the 19th century - The theory that freaks are biological throwbacks to earlier races of humans and apes is introduced.  The theory of [[maternal impression]] attributes traumatic or significant events experienced by the pregnant woman as an explanation for deformities.

Turn of the 20th century - The resurgence of [[Mendel]]’s law of genetics coupled with [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[The Origin of Species|Origin of Species]]'' introduced the idea that freaks could "taint the gene pool".

'''1904''' - Silbey devises the "[[sideshow|Ten-In-One]]" show and creates jobs for talkers.

'''1922''' - Professor Sam Wagner starts the World's Circus freak show at Coney Island. General public can read articles in popular press explaining the diseases behind oddities.

'''1925''' - Freaks can be seen performing on the [[vaudeville]] stage.

'''1932''' - [[Tod Browning]]'s [[Pre-Code]]-[[era]] [[film]] ''[[Freaks]]'' tells the story of a traveling freakshow. The use of real freaks in the film provoked public outcries and was widely unsuccessful until its re-release in 1960s.

'''1933''' - [[World's Fair|Chicago Expo]] features a pit show with a "live two-headed baby" in a jar of formaldehyde.

'''Late 1930s''' - The switch in social view of those with physical or mental anomalies from fabulous freaks and curiosities to diseased people with disorders was complete.

'''1940''' - Freakshow is on the ropes and the dime museum essentially dead.  The three-legged man, [[Frank Lentini]], opens a freakshow.

'''1950''' - Historical sideshow died as public demands freaks be given "dignity" and not exhibited, at this time many went into institutions or on the welfare system.

'''1996''' - Chicago shock-jock Mancow Muller presented Mancow's Freak Show at the United Center in the Summer of 1996, to crowd of 30,000. The show included Kathy Stiles and her brother Grady III as the Lobster Twins.

'''1998''' - The Brazilian TV show "Ratinho Livre", whose main performer was Carlos "Ratinho" Massa became a kind of freak show, exhibiting mainly children with serious physical anomalies, such as hundreds of facial tumors (Eleandro, the Elephant Boy), tails, amputations, et cetera. Later, near 2000, the Brazilian justice prohibited such appearances on TV shows.

'''2000&amp;ndash;2007''' Ken Harck's Brothers Grim Sideshow debuted at the Great Circus Parade in Milwaukee, WI in the summer of 2000.
