[[Intersex]] people are born with [[sex]] characteristics, such as [[chromosome]]s, [[gonad]]s, or [[genital]]s, that, according to the UN [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]], "do not fit typical binary notions of [[male]] or [[female]] bodies."&lt;ref name="unfe-fact"&gt;{{Cite web | author = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | publisher = United Nations [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | title = Free &amp; Equal Campaign Fact Sheet: Intersex | date = 2015 | url = https://unfe.org/system/unfe-65-Intersex_Factsheet_ENGLISH.pdf | access-date = 28 March 2016 | archive-date = 4 March 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071043/https://unfe.org/system/unfe-65-Intersex_Factsheet_ENGLISH.pdf | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intersex persons often face [[Social stigma|stigmatisation]] and [[discrimination]] from birth, particularly when an intersex variation is visible. In some countries this may include [[infanticide]], abandonment and the stigmatization of families. Mothers in [[East Africa]] may be accused of [[witchcraft]], and the birth of an intersex child may be described as a [[curse]].&lt;ref name="cschrcl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbkci2015"/&gt;

Intersex infants and children, such as those with ambiguous outer genitalia, may be surgically and/or hormonally altered to fit perceived more socially acceptable sex characteristics. However, this is considered controversial, with no firm evidence of good outcomes.&lt;ref name="apeg2013"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=aafe43f3-c6a2-4525-ad16-15e4210ee0ac&amp;subId=16191 | title = Submission 88 to the Australian Senate inquiry on the involuntary or coerced sterilisation of people with disabilities in Australia | work = Australasian Paediatric Endocrine Group (APEG) | date = 27 June 2013 | access-date = 19 July 2015 | archive-date = 23 September 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923174608/http://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=aafe43f3-c6a2-4525-ad16-15e4210ee0ac&amp;subId=16191 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such treatments may involve sterilization.

{{quotation|Intersex individuals are considered individuals with a "disorder" in all areas in which Western medicine prevails. They are more or less obviously treated as sick or "abnormal", depending on the respective society.}}

The [[Council of Europe]] highlights several areas of concern:

* Equal right to life and prevention of medical treatments without informed consent including treatments considered unnecessary;
* Removal of Intersex as a curable medical condition but one which can have medical treatments with informed consent
* Equal treatment under the law; including specific legal provision similar to other classes covered;
* Access to information, medical records, peer and other counselling and support;
* [[Self-determination]] in gender recognition, through expeditious access to official documents.&lt;ref name="coe"&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Council of Europe| last2 = Commissioner for Human Rights| title = Human rights and intersex people, Issue Paper| date = April 2015| url = https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=CommDH/IssuePaper(2015)1&amp;Language=lanEnglish&amp;Ver=original| author1-link = Council of Europe| access-date = 2022-03-09| archive-date = 2016-01-06| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160106203349/https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=CommDH%2FIssuePaper%282015%291&amp;Language=lanEnglish&amp;Ver=original| url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship between Intersex and LGBT ===
{{main|Intersex and LGBT}}
Multiple organizations have highlighted appeals to LGBT rights recognition that fail to address the issue of unnecessary "normalising" treatments on intersex children, using the portmanteau term "[[Pinkwashing (LGBT)|pinkwashing]]". In June 2016, [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] pointed to contradictory statements by Australian governments, suggesting that the dignity and rights of LGBTI (LGBT and intersex) people are recognized while, at the same time, harmful practices on intersex children continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Submission: list of issues for Australia's Convention Against Torture review | url = https://oii.org.au/30546/loi-cat-review/ | work = [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] | date = June 28, 2016 | access-date = September 4, 2016 | archive-date = September 9, 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170909233430/https://oii.org.au/30546/loi-cat-review/ | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, [[Zwischengeschlecht]] described actions to promote equality or civil status legislation without action on banning "intersex genital mutilations" as a form of "pinkwashing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = "Intersex legislation" that allows the daily mutilations to continue = PINKWASHING of IGM practices | url = http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/Intersex-politics-that-ignore-the-daily-mutilations-PINKWASHING-OF-IGM-PRACTICES | work = [[Zwischengeschlecht]] | date = August 28, 2016 | access-date = September 4, 2016 | archive-date = September 19, 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160919050911/http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/Intersex-politics-that-ignore-the-daily-mutilations-PINKWASHING-OF-IGM-PRACTICES | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has previously highlighted evasive government statements to UN Treaty Bodies that conflate intersex, transgender and LGBT issues, instead of addressing harmful practices on infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = TRANSCRIPTION &gt; UK Questioned over Intersex Genital Mutilations by UN Committee on the Rights of the Child - Gov Non-Answer + Denial | url = http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/UK-Questioned-over-Intersex-Genital-Mutilations-by-UN-Committee-on-the-Rights-of-the-Child | work = [[Zwischengeschlecht]] | date = May 26, 2016 | access-date = September 4, 2016 | archive-date = September 19, 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160919045730/http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/UK-Questioned-over-Intersex-Genital-Mutilations-by-UN-Committee-on-the-Rights-of-the-Child | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intersex people face stigmatisation and discrimination from birth. In some countries, particularly in Africa and Asia, this may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families.

Non-consensual medical interventions to modify the sex characteristics of intersex people take place in all countries where the human rights of intersex people have been explored.&lt;ref name="ghattas" /&gt; Such interventions have been criticized by the World Health Organization, other UN bodies such as the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and an increasing number of regional and national institutions. In low and middle income countries, the cost of healthcare may limit access to necessary medical treatment at the same time that other individuals experience coercive medical interventions.&lt;ref name="bbkci2015" /&gt;

Several rights have been stated as affected by stigmatization and coercive medical interventions on minors:
* the [[right to life]].&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;
* the [[right to privacy]], including a right to personal [[autonomy]] or self-determination regarding medical treatment.&lt;ref name="SenateOnSterilisation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="swissnek" /&gt;

{{further|Intersex human rights reports}}
In recent years, Intersex rights have been the subject of reports by several national and international institutions. These include the Swiss National Advisory Commission on Biomedical Ethics (2012),&lt;ref name="swissnek" /&gt; the [[United Nations special rapporteur|UN special rapporteur]] on torture and other cruel, [[inhuman or degrading treatment]] or punishment (2013),&lt;ref name="untorture"/&gt; and the Australian Senate (2013).&lt;ref name="SenateOnSterilisation" /&gt; In 2015 the [[Council of Europe]], the United Nations [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] and the [[World Health Organization]] also addressed the issue. In April 2015, [[Intersex rights in Malta|Malta]] became the first country to outlaw coercive medical interventions.&lt;ref name="nyt-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="star-2015" /&gt; In the same year, the Council of Europe became the first institution to state that intersex people have the right ''not'' to undergo sex affirmation interventions.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;

For [[Intersex Awareness Day]], October 26, UN experts including the [[United Nations Convention against Torture#Committee against Torture|Committee against Torture]], the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]] and the [[Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], along with the Council of Europe [[Commissioner for Human Rights]], the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] and [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]]s called for an urgent end to human rights violations against intersex persons, including in medical settings. The experts also called for the investigation of alleged human rights abuses, the ability to file claims for compensation, and the implementation of anti-discrimination measures:&lt;ref name="un-2016"&gt;{{Citation| last = Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights| author-link = Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights| title = End violence and harmful medical practices on intersex children and adults, UN and regional experts urge| date = October 24, 2016| url = http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20739&amp;LangID=E| access-date = July 28, 2017| archive-date = November 21, 2016| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161121185256/http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20739&amp;LangID=E| url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|In countries around the world, intersex infants, children and adolescents are subjected to medically unnecessary surgeries, hormonal treatments and other procedures in an attempt to forcibly change their appearance to be in line with societal expectations about female and male bodies. When, as is frequently the case, these procedures are performed without the full, free and informed consent of the person concerned, they amount to violations of fundamental human rights...

States must, as a matter of urgency, prohibit medically unnecessary surgery and procedures on intersex children. They must uphold the autonomy of intersex adults and children and their rights to health, to physical and mental integrity, to live free from violence and harmful practices and to be free from torture and ill-treatment.

===Constitutional Court of Colombia===
{{main|Intersex rights in Colombia}}
Although not many cases of children with intersex conditions are available, a case taken to the [[Constitutional Court of Colombia]] led to changes in their treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Skyler|title=Reproductive Organs and Differences of Sex Development: The Constitutional Issues Created by the Surgical Treatment of Intersex Children|journal=McGeorge Law Review|year=2010–2011|volume=42|page=863|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/mcglr42&amp;div=66&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals|access-date=15 November 2012|archive-date=18 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218001531/http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals%2Fmcglr42&amp;div=66&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case restricted the power of doctors and parents to decide surgical procedures on children's ambiguous genitalia after the age of five, while continuing to permit interventions on younger children. Due to the decision of the Constitutional Court of Colombia on Case 1 Part 1 (SU-337 of 1999), doctors are obliged to inform parents on all the aspects of the intersex child. Parents can only consent to surgery if they have received accurate information, and cannot give consent after the child reaches the age of five. By then the child will have, supposedly, realized their gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corte Constitucional de Colombia: Sentencia T-1025/02|url=http://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/relatoria/2002/t-1025-02.htm|access-date=2 December 2012|archive-date=20 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130220193844/http://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/relatoria/2002/t-1025-02.htm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court case led to the setting of legal guidelines for doctors' surgical practice on intersex children.

{{quotation|14. (1) It shall be unlawful for medical practitioners or other professionals to conduct any sex assignment treatment and/or surgical intervention on the sex characteristics of a minor which treatment and/or intervention can be deferred until the person to be treated can provide informed consent: Provided that such sex assignment treatment and/or surgical intervention on the sex characteristics of the minor shall be conducted if the minor gives informed consent through the person exercising parental authority or the tutor of the minor.
(2) In exceptional circumstances treatment may be effected once agreement is reached between the Interdisciplinary Team and the persons exercising parental authority or tutor of the minor who is still unable to provide consent: Provided that medical intervention which is driven by social factors without the consent of the minor, will be in violation of this Act.&lt;ref name="gigesc"/&gt;}}

==Right to life==
{{further|Genetic diagnosis of intersex}}
[[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD or PIGD) refers to [[Genetics|genetic]] testing of [[embryo]]s prior to [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] (as a form of [[embryo profiling]]), and sometimes even of [[oocyte]]s prior to [[Fertilisation|fertilization]]. PGD is considered in a similar fashion to [[prenatal diagnosis]]. When used to screen for a specific genetic condition, the method makes it highly likely that the baby will be free of the condition under consideration. PGD thus is an adjunct to [[assisted reproductive technology]], and requires [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) to obtain oocytes or embryos for evaluation. The technology allows discrimination against those with [[intersex]] traits.

[[Georgiann Davis]] argues that such discrimination fails to recognize that many people with intersex traits lead full and happy lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/15265161.2013.828119| issn = 1526-5161| volume = 13| issue = 10| pages = 51–53| last = Davis| first = Georgiann| author-link=Georgiann Davis|title = The Social Costs of Preempting Intersex Traits| journal = The American Journal of Bioethics| date = October 2013| pmid=24024811| s2cid = 7331095}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morgan Carpenter]] highlights the appearance of several intersex variations in a list by the UK [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]] of "serious" "genetic conditions" that may be de-selected, including [[5 alpha reductase deficiency]] and [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]], traits evident in elite women athletes and "the world's first openly [[Tony Briffa (politician)|intersex mayor]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Carpenter |first=Morgan |author-link=Morgan Carpenter |title=Morgan Carpenter at LGBTI Human Rights in the Commonwealth conference |location=Glasgow |date=July 18, 2014 |access-date=April 29, 2021 |url=http://oii.org.au/27467/lgbti-human-rights-in-the-commonwealth/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912102123/http://oii.org.au/27467/lgbti-human-rights-in-the-commonwealth/ |archive-date=September 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] has called for the Australian [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] to prohibit such interventions, noting a "close entanglement of intersex status, gender identity and sexual orientation in social understandings of sex and gender norms, and in medical and medical sociology literature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report| publisher = Organisation Intersex International Australia| last1 = Carpenter| first1 = Morgan| author2-link = Organisation Intersex International Australia| last2 = Organisation Intersex International Australia| title = Submission on the Review of Part B of the Ethical Guidelines for the Use of Assisted Reproductive Technology in Clinical Practice and Research, 2007| location = Sydney| date = April 30, 2014| url = http://oii.org.au/25621/submission-ethics-genetic-selection-intersex-traits/| access-date = September 13, 2015| archive-date = October 6, 2014| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006114348/http://oii.org.au/25621/submission-ethics-genetic-selection-intersex-traits/| url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[Council of Europe]] published an Issue Paper on ''Human rights and intersex people'', remarking:

{{quotation|Intersex people's right to life can be violated in discriminatory "sex selection" and "preimplantation genetic diagnosis, other forms of testing, and selection for particular characteristics".

[[Intersex rights in South Africa|South Africa]] was the first country to explicitly add intersex to legislation, as part of the attribute of "sex".&lt;ref name="zagaz"/&gt; [[Intersex rights in Australia|Australia]] was the first country to add an independent attribute, of "intersex status".&lt;ref name="com law"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013A00098 | title = Sex Discrimination Amendment (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) Act 2013, No. 98, 2013, C2013A00098 | work = ComLaw | date = 2013 | access-date = 2015-07-19 | archive-date = 2014-10-06 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006122244/http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013A00098 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intersex rights in Malta|Malta]] was the first to adopt a broader framework of "sex characteristics, through legislation that also ended modifications to the sex characteristics of minors undertaken for social and cultural reasons.&lt;ref name="gate-malta" /&gt;  [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] listed as "sex characteristics"&lt;ref name="ilgaeurope"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lezbelib.com"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lezbelib.com/europe-news/lgbti-people-are-now-better-protected-in-bosnia-and-herzegovina | title = LGBTI people are now better protected in Bosnia and Herzegovina | access-date = 2016-08-02 | archive-date = 2016-08-26 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160826022235/http://www.lezbelib.com/europe-news/lgbti-people-are-now-better-protected-in-bosnia-and-herzegovina | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greece]] prohibits discrimination and hate crimes based on "sex characteristics", since 24 December 2015.&lt;ref name="et.gr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Πρώτη φορά, ίσοι απέναντι στον νόμο"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.efsyn.gr/arthro/proti-fora-isoi-apenanti-ston-nomo | script-title = el:Πρώτη φορά, ίσοι απέναντι στον νόμο | date = 2015-12-23 | language = el | access-date = 2016-03-14 | archive-date = 2017-10-25 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171025203410/http://www.efsyn.gr/arthro/proti-fora-isoi-apenanti-ston-nomo | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2021, [[Serbia]] also prohibits discrimination based on "sex characteristics".&lt;ref name="XY Spectrum"/&gt; Since 2022, [[Chile]] bans discrimination based on "sex characteristics" under Law 21,430.&lt;ref name="Chile childhood law" /&gt;

=== Education ===
An Australian survey of 272 persons born with atypical sex characteristics, published in 2016, found that 18% of respondents (compared to an Australian average of 2%) failed to complete secondary school, with early school leaving coincident with pubertal medical interventions, bullying and other factors.&lt;ref name="jones2016ed"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/14681811.2016.1149808| issn = 1468-1811 | pages = 602–618| last = Jones| first = Tiffany| title = The needs of students with intersex variations| journal = Sex Education| volume = 16 | issue = 6 | date = March 11, 2016 | s2cid = 74173324 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] issued a statement explaining Section 1557 of the [[Affordable Care Act]] stating that the Act prohibits "discrimination on the basis of intersex traits or atypical sex characteristics" in publicly funded healthcare, as part of a prohibition of discrimination "on the basis of sex".&lt;ref name="interacthealth"&gt;{{cite web| last = [[Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth|interACT]]| title = Federal Government Bans Discrimination Against Intersex People in Health Care| work = interactadvocates| date = 23 May 2016| access-date = 2016-05-27| url = http://interactadvocates.org/federal-government-bans-discrimination-against-intersex-people-in-health-care/| archive-date = 2016-05-28| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160528104341/http://interactadvocates.org/federal-government-bans-discrimination-against-intersex-people-in-health-care/| url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal recognition ==
{{main|Legal recognition of intersex people}}
According to the [[Asia Pacific Forum]] of National Human Rights Institutions, few countries have provided for the legal recognition of intersex people. The Forum states that the legal recognition of intersex people is:

* firstly about access to the same rights as other men and women, when assigned male or female; 
* secondly it is about access to administrative corrections to legal documents when an original [[sex assignment]] is not appropriate; and 
* thirdly, while opt in schemes may help some individuals, legal recognition is not about the creation of a third [[sex or gender]] classification for intersex people as a population, but instead is about enabling an opt-in scheme for any individual who seeks it.&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt;

In some jurisdictions, access to any form of identification document can be an issue.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;

===Gender identities===
Like all individuals, some intersex individuals may be raised as a particular sex (male or female) but then identify with another later in life, while most do not.&lt;ref name="Money"&gt;{{cite book |last=Money |first=John |author-link = John Money |author2=Ehrhardt, Anke A. |title=Man &amp; Woman Boy &amp; Girl.

A 2012 clinical review suggests that between 8.5-20% of persons with intersex conditions may experience [[gender dysphoria]],&lt;ref name="furtado"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Furtado P.

===Access to identification documents===
Depending on the jurisdiction, access to any birth certificate may be an issue,&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-intersex-idUSKCN0JJ1M120141205|title=Kenya takes step toward recognizing intersex people in landmark ruling|website=Reuters|date=2014-12-05|access-date=2021-07-05|archive-date=2015-09-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924211232/http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/05/us-kenya-intersex-idUSKCN0JJ1M120141205|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a birth certificate with a sex marker.&lt;ref name="adv-de"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2013/11/06/op-ed-germany's-third-gender-law-fails-equality | first = Hida | last = Viloria | work = The Advocate | title = Op-ed: Germany's Third-Gender Law Fails on Equality | date = November 6, 2013 | access-date = March 9, 2022 | archive-date = March 9, 2022 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220309212250/https://www.advocate.com/commentary/2013/11/06/op-ed-germany%E2%80%99s-third-gender-law-fails-equality | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, in the case of ''Baby 'A' (Suing through her Mother E.A) &amp; another v Attorney General &amp; 6 others [2014]'', a Kenyan court ordered the Kenyan government to issue a birth certificate to a five-year-old child born in 2009 with ambiguous genitalia.&lt;ref name="Reuters2014"&gt;{{cite news|last=Migiro|first=Katy|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-intersex-idUSKCN0JJ1M120141205|title=Kenya takes step toward recognizing intersex people in landmark ruling|work=Reuters|access-date=2021-07-05|archive-date=2015-09-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924211232/http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/05/us-kenya-intersex-idUSKCN0JJ1M120141205|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Intersex rights in Kenya|Kenya]] a birth certificate is necessary for attending school, getting a national identity document, and voting.&lt;ref name="Reuters2014"/&gt; Many intersex persons in [[Intersex rights in Uganda|Uganda]] are understood to be stateless due to historical difficulties in obtaining identification documents, despite a birth registration law that permits intersex minors to change assignment.&lt;ref name="sipd2016"&gt;{{Citation| last = Support Initiative for Persons with Congenital Disorders| title = Baseline Survey on Intersex Realities in East Africa - Specific Focus on Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda| date = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to the same rights as other men and women===
The [[Asia Pacific Forum]] of [[National Human Rights Institutions]] states that:
{{quotation|Recognition before the law means having legal personhood and the legal protections that flow from that. For intersex people, this is neither primarily nor solely about amending birth registrations or other official documents. Firstly, it is about intersex people who have been issued a male or a female birth certificate being able to enjoy the same legal rights as other men and women.&lt;ref name="afp2016"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = [[Asia Pacific Forum|Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions]]| isbn = 978-0-9942513-7-4| last = Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions| title = Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics| date = June 2016| url = http://www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/manual-sogi-and-sex-charactersitics/| access-date = 2016-08-29| archive-date = 2017-01-15| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170115144950/http://www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/manual-sogi-and-sex-charactersitics/| url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Binary categories===
Access to a birth certificate with a correct sex marker may be an issue for people who do not identify with their sex assigned at birth,&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt; or it may only be available accompanied by surgical requirements.&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt;

The passports and identification documents of [[Intersex rights in Australia|Australia]] and some other nationalities have adopted "X" as a valid third category besides "M" (male) and "F" (female), at least since 2003.&lt;ref name="Science as Culture"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ingrid | last = Holme | title = Hearing People's Own Stories | journal = Science as Culture | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | doi = 10.1080/09505430802280784 | date = 2008| pages=341–344| s2cid = 143528047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nzpass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.passports.govt.nz/Transgender-applicants|title=New Zealand Passports - Information about Changing Sex / Gender Identity|access-date=6 October 2014|archive-date=23 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140923055123/http://www.passports.govt.nz/Transgender-applicants|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Germany became the first European nation to allow babies with characteristics of both sexes to be registered as ''indeterminate gender'' on birth certificates, amidst opposition and skepticism from intersex organisations who point out that the law appears to mandate exclusion from male or female categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dw.de/third-sex-option-on-birth-certificates/a-17193869 | title = Third sex option on birth certificates | work = [[Deutsche Welle]] | date = 1 November 2013 | access-date = 19 July 2015 | archive-date = 10 October 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141010184218/http://www.dw.de/third-sex-option-on-birth-certificates/a-17193869 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oiieurope.org/bluff-package-for-inter-leaving-sex-entry-open-is-not-an-option/ | title = Sham package for Intersex: Leaving sex entry open is not an option | work = [[OII Europe]] | date = 15 February 2013 | access-date = 19 July 2015 | archive-date = 29 August 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140829115843/http://oiieurope.org/bluff-package-for-inter-leaving-sex-entry-open-is-not-an-option/ | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of Europe acknowledged this approach, and concerns about recognition of third and blank classifications in a 2015 Issue Paper, stating that these may lead to "forced outings" and "lead to an increase in pressure on parents of intersex children to decide in favour of one sex."&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt; The Issue Paper argues that "further reflection on non-binary legal identification is necessary":

[[Mauro Cabral]], [[Global Action for Trans Equality]] (GATE) Co-Director, indicated that any recognition outside the “F”/”M” dichotomy needs to be adequately planned and executed with a human rights point of view, noting that: {{quotation|“People tend to identify a [[third sex]] with freedom from the gender binary, but that is not necessarily the case. If only trans and/or intersex people can access that third category, or if they are compulsively assigned a third sex, then the gender binary gets stronger, not weaker”&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;}}
