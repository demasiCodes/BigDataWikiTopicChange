A '''snob''' is someone who adopts the [[worldview]] of '''snobbery''' — that some people are inherently inferior to him or her for any one of a variety of reasons, including real or supposed [[intellect]], [[wealth]], [[education]], [[ancestry]], [[taste_(sociology)|taste]], [[beauty]], et cetera. Often, the form of snobbery reflects the snob's personal attributes. For example, a common snobbery of the affluent is the belief that wealth is either the cause or result of superiority, or both, and a common snobbery of the physically attractive is that beauty is paramount.

Snobbery existed even in mediaeval feudal aristocratic Europe, when the clothing, manners, language and tastes of every class were strictly codified by customs or law. [[Chaucer]], a poet moving in the court circles, noted the provincial French spoken by the Prioress among the [[Canterbury Tales|Canterbury pilgrims]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;And French she spoke full fair and fetisly&lt;ref&gt;''Fetisly'': nicely.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
After the school of Stratford atte Bowe,&lt;/br&gt; 
For French of Paris was to her unknowe.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

William Rothwell notes "the simplistic contrast between the 'pure' French of Paris and her 'defective' French of Stratford atte Bowe that would invite disparagement."&lt;ref&gt;Rothwell, "Stratford Atte Bowe re-visited" ''The Chaucer Review'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The disparagement is an element in the snobbism.

Snobbery surfaced more strongly as the structure of the society changed, and the [[bourgeoisie]] had the possibility to ''imitate'' [[aristocracy]]. Snobbery appears when elements of culture are perceived as belonging to an aristocracy or elite, and some people (the snobs) feel that the mere adoption of the fashion and tastes of the elite or aristocracy is sufficient to include someone in the elites, upper classes or aristocracy. 

However, a form of snobbery can be adopted by someone not a part of that group; a [[pseudointellectual|pseudo-intellectual]], a celebrity worshipper, and a poor person idolizing money and the rich are types of snobs who do not base their snobbery on their personal attributes. Such a snob idolizes and imitates, if possible, the manners, worldview, and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] of a classification of people to which they aspire, but do not belong, and to which they may never belong (wealthy, famous, intellectual, beautiful, etc.). 

A snob is perceived by those being imitated as an ''arriviste'', perhaps ''[[nouveau riche]]'' or ''[[parvenu]]'', and the [[elite]] group closes ranks to exclude such outsiders, often by developing elaborate social codes, [[status symbol|symbolic status]] and recognizable marks of language. The snobs in response refine their behavior model.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norbert Elias]] (Edmund Jephcott, tr.), ''The Court Society'', 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Hazlitt]] observed, in a culture where deference to class was accepted as a positive and unifying principle,&lt;ref&gt;The social historian [[G.M. Trevelyan]] referred to the deferential principle in British society as "beneficent snobbery", according toRay 1955:24.&lt;/ref&gt; "Fashion is gentility running away from vulgarity, and afraid of being overtaken by it, [[William Hazlitt]] observed, adding subversively, "It is a sign the two things are not very far apart.""&lt;ref&gt;Hazlitt, ''Conversations with Northcote'', quoted in Gordon N. Ray, "Thackeray's 'Book of Snobs'", ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'' '''10'''.1 (June 1955:22-33) p. 25; Ray examines the context of snobbery in contemporaneous society.&lt;/ref&gt; The English novelist[[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Bulwer-Lytton]] remarked in passing, "Ideas travel upwards, ''manners'' downwards."&lt;!--italics in original--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bulwer-Lytton, ''England and the English'', noted in Ray 1955:24.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not the deeply ingrained and fundamentally accepted idea of "one's betters" that has marked snobbism in traditional European and American culture, but "aping one's betters".

Snobbism is a defensive expression of [[Emotional insecurity|social insecurity]], flourishing most where an [[The Establishment|Establishment]] has become less than secure in the exercise of its traditional prerogatives, and thus it was an organizing principle for Thackeray's glimpses of British society in the threatening atmosphere of the 1840s than it was of Hazlitt, writing in the comparative social stability of the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;This point is made by Ray 1955:25f.&lt;/ref&gt;


==Reverse snobbery==
{{main|Anti-elitism}} 
'''Reverse snobbery''' is the phenomenon of looking unfavorably on perceived social [[elites]] &amp;ndash; effectively the opposite of snobbery. For instance, poorer members of society may eventually consider themselves to be friendlier, happier, more honest or moral than richer members of the society, and middle-income members of society may stress their poorer origins. This is common in British politics, in which MPs often say things such as "I grew up on a [[council estate]]" to try to prove their common roots.

The term ''[[bourgeois]]'' is frequently used in [[North America]] among those who self-identify as [[working class]], to describe individuals who borrow veneers of upper classes in order to affect a sophisticated, cultured image. In a related phenomenon, people who have worked to change their material lives may be accused of having "betrayed their roots".&lt;ref&gt;In the sense of their [[cultural heritage]].&lt;/ref&gt;
