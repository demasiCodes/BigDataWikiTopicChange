A '''snob''', guilty of '''snobbery''', is someone who adopts the [[worldview]] that some people are inherently inferior to him/her for any one of a variety of reasons, including real or supposed [[intellect]], [[wealth]], [[education]], [[ancestry]], etc.{{Fact|date=May 2007}} Often, the form of snobbery reflects the offending individual's socio-economic background. For example, a common snobbery of the affluent is the affectation that wealth is either the cause or result of superiority, or both, as in the case of privileged children.

However, a form of snobbery can be adopted by someone not a part of that group; a [[pseudointellectual|pseudo-intellectual]] is a type of snob. Such a snob imitates the manners, adopts the worldview, and affects the [[lifestyle]] of a [[social class]] of people to which he or she aspires, but does not yet belong, and to which he or she may never belong.

A snob is perceived by those being imitated as an ''arriviste'', perhaps ''[[nouveau riche]]'' or ''[[parvenu]]'', and the [[elite]] group closes ranks to exclude such outsiders, often by developing elaborate social codes, [[status symbol|symbolic status]] and recognizable marks of language. The snobs, in response, refine their behavior model.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norbert Elias]], ''The Court Society'' 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical origins==

Characteristically, snobs look down on people who are part of groups which they regard as inferior, or flaunt their wealth in order to make others seem inferior. Compare the points of view embodied in the informal and subjective categories of "[[highbrow]]" and its contrasted "[[lowbrow]]". 

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' finds the word ''snab'' in a 1781 document with the meaning of ''[[shoemaker]]'' with a Scottish origin. The connection between "snab", also spelled "snob", and its more familiar meaning arising in [[England]] fifty years later is not direct.

Though the once popular etymology of ''snob'' as a contraction of the Latin phrase ''sine nobilitate'' ("without nobility") is now discredited,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What is the origin of the word 'snob'? | url = http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutwordorigins/snob | work = AskOxford (Oxford Dictionaries) | accessdate = 2008-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 1878 quote from the trade magazine ''The Tailor and Cutter'' admits no other interpretation: "it is the correct thing to vote a showily dressed man a snob."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Phillis Emily Cunnington, ''The History of Underclothes'' 1992:169.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is agreed, however, that the word "snob" broke into broad public usage with [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s ''[[Book of Snobs]]'', a collection of satirical sketches that appeared in the magazine ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'', published in 1848. Thackeray's definition of ''snob'' then was: "He who meanly admires mean things is a Snob". The "mean things" were the showy things of this world, like a secretaryship in the Queen's Cabinet, where Prime Ministers invariably retired as [[earl]]s. 

:"Suppose in a game of life &amp;mdash; and it is but a twopenny game after all &amp;mdash; you are equally eager of winning. Shall you be ashamed of your ambition, or glory in it?" 
:::&amp;mdash; Thackeray, "Autour de mon Chapeau", 1863

Thackeray had many opportunities to study snobs in action as he grew up. He was born in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], [[India]], the only son of a Collector in the service of the [[British East India Company]], a sphere of opportunity for Englishmen of talent whose social standing was an impediment to a career at home, but who in India could lord it like a "[[Nawab|nabob]]". After his father died, Thackeray was sent home to England to be educated at the ancient and respectable (though not too stylish) [[public school (England)|public school]] [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]], and at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].
