A snob is perceived by those being imitated as an ''"arriviste"'', perhaps ''[[nouveau riche]],'' and the [[elite]] group closes ranks to exclude such outsiders, often by developing elaborate social codes, [[status symbol|symbolic status]] and recognizable marks of language. The snobs in response refine their behavior model.

"Snob" began as schoolboy slang at [[Eton]] in the post-[[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] generation, when many more sons of the rich manufacturers of the booming [[industrial revolution]] were joining the sons of the gentry. The "snobs" designated the group of boys who were not "nobs," the [[nobility]], those who carried the designation "Hon." before their names if they did not actually carry a [[courtesy title]]. The "snobs" were those who, ''sine nobilitate'' ("without a title to nobility"), carried themselves as "swells."  The phrase broke into public usage with [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s ''Book of Snobs'', a collection of satiric sketches that appeared in the magazine ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'' and were collected and published in 1848.
Thackeray's definition of "snob" then: "he who meanly admires mean things is a Snob." The "mean things" were the showy things of this world, like a secretaryship in the Queen's Cabinet, where Prime Ministers invariably retired as [[earl]]s. 

:"Suppose in a game of life&amp;mdash;  and it is but a twopenny game after all&amp;mdash; you are equally eager of winning. Shall you be ashamed of your ambition, or glory in it?" 
:::&amp;mdash; Thackeray, "Autour de mon Chapeau," 1863

Thackeray had every opportunity to study snobs in action as he grew up. He was born in [[Calcutta, India]], the only son of a Collector in the service of the [[British East India Company]], a sphere of opportunity for Englishmen of talent whose social standing was an impediment to a career at home, but who in India could lord it like a "[[nabob]]". After his father died Thackeray was sent to home to England to be educated at the ancient and respectable though not quite stylish "[[public school (UK)|public school]]" [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]] and at Trinity College, Cambridge. 

In a [[hierarchy|hierarchic]] organization, such as the [[British Raj]], the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], the [[United States Air Force]] or the [[Jesuit]]s, the path to advancement from below is often eased for those who most whole-heartedly adopt the point-of-view of their superiors.

In a less hierarchic society, such as today's Western democracies, snobbism takes new forms, with a different dynamic. In modern society, certain [[celebrity]] figures occupy the center of an "in-group," and snobbery apes the outward style of those perceived as being at the center.  This imitation is often characterized by [[conspicuous consumption]], a phenomenon described by the economist and sociologist [[Thorstein Veblen]].</rev></revisions></page></pages></query></api>
