[[Australia]] today is a multiethnic society and the product of more than two centuries of immigration. Laws forbid racial and other forms of discrimination and protect freedom of religion. Demographic analysis indicates a high level of inter-ethnic marriage: according to the 2006 [[Australian Census]], a majority of [[Indigenous Australians]] partnered with non-indigenous Australians, and a majority of third generation Australians of non-English-speaking background had partnered with persons of different ethnic origin (the majority partnered with persons of Australian or Anglo-Celtic background, which constitutes the majority ethnic grouping in Australia).&lt;ref&gt;http://arts.monash.edu.au/cpur/publications/documents/intermarriage-report-final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, about 25.6 per cent of the estimated resident population of Australia comprised those born overseas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.immi.gov.au/media/fact-sheets/15population.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, there have been both historical and contemporary incidents of racism in Australia.

For around 50,000 years, prior to the arrival of British Settlers in 1788, Australia was occupied exclusively by [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islander]] peoples.  Post-1788, the [[British Empire]] applied the European legal precept of [[Terra Nullius]] to the Australian continent and imposed political and economic control of it in the lead up to the 1901 foundation of the independent [[Commonwealth of Australia]]. Despite theoretical notions of equality contained within [[British law]], Government policy and public opinion in colonial times and the early decades of Federation very often treated Aboriginal people as inferior.

Initially, indigenous Australians were in most states deprived of the rights of full citizenship of the new nation on grounds of their race and restrictive immigration laws were introduced to preference "white" European immigrants to Australia. Discriminatory laws against indigenous people and multiethnic immigration were dismantled in the early decades of the Post War period. A [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 Referendum]]  regarding Aboriginal rights was carried with over 90% approval by the electorate. Legal reforms have re-established Aboriginal Land Rights under Australian law and in the early 21st century, indigenous Australians accounted for around 2.5% of the population, owning outright around 20% of all land. Intense focus on the impact of historical policies like the [[Stolen Generation|removal of mixed ethnicity Aboriginal children]] from their Aboriginal parent resulted in a bipartisan Parliamentary apology to Aborigines carried in 2008. Aboriginal health indicators remain lower than other ethnic groups within Australia and again are the subject of political debate.

Policies of [[multiculturalism]] were pursued in the post-war period and first Eastern and Southern European, then Asian and African immigration increased dramatically and Australia became one of the most ethnically diverse nations on earth. Legislation including the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]], the Commonwealth [[Racial Hatred Act]] (1995) and the [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act]] (1986) outlaw racial discrimination in the public sphere in Australia. In recent decades, anti-immigration political parties like the [[One Nation Party]] have received extensive media coverage, but only marginal electoral support and successive governments have maintained large, multiethnic programs of immigration.  As in other Western nations, tensions in the aftermath of events like the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[2002 Bali bombings|Bali Bombing]] by radical Islamists contributed to strained ethnic relations in some Australian communities.

==Indigenous Australians==

[[Indigenous Australians]] comprise two groups: [[Aboriginal Australians]], who occupy mainland Australia and Tasmania, and [[Torres Strait Islanders]], who occupy the [[Torres Strait]] near New Guinea. The small population of [[Tasmanian Aborigines]] suffered a rapid collapse following the establishment of Britain's [[Van Diemens Land]] Colony in the early 19th century, and their remaining descendants are all of mixed Aboriginal-Settler ethnic heritage. In the past, indigenous Australians were subject to racist government policy and community attitudes.  Despite massive shifts in community attitudes, legal reforms and billions of dollars in financial support, many indigenous people continue to suffer from the consequences of the British colonial period and early decades of the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

At the time of first [[Europe]]an contact, it has been estimated the absolute minimum pre-1788 population was 315,000, while recent archaeological finds suggest (unlikelily) that a population of 750,000 could have been sustained.&lt;ref name="pop_abs"&gt;[http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/94713ad445ff1425ca25682000192af2/bfc28642d31c215cca256b350010b3f4!OpenDocument 1301.0 - Year Book Australia, 2002] [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] 25 January 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 [[Australian Census]] measured the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population at 517,200 or 2.5% of the total Australian population.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/4705.0Media%20Release12006?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=4705.0&amp;issue=2006&amp;num=&amp;view=&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, around 20% of the Australian land-mass (including Tasmania and offshore islands) was owned by Aboriginal people.&lt;ref name="reconciliation1"&gt;http://reconciliation.org.au/home/resources/factsheets/q-a-factsheets/aboriginal-land-rights&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical relations===

The British navigator [[James Cook]] claimed the east coast of Australia for Britain in 1770, without conducting negotiations with the existing inhabitants. The first [[Governor of New South Wales]], [[Arthur Phillip]], was instructed explicitly to establish friendship and good relations with the Aborigines and interactions between the early settlers and the indigenous people varied considerably throughout the colonial period — from the mutual curiosity displayed by the early interlocutors [[Bennelong]] and [[Bungaree]] of Sydney, to the outright hostility of [[Pemulwuy]] and [[Windradyne]] of the Sydney region,&lt;ref&gt;[[Wendy Lewis (Australian Writer)|Lewis]], Balderstone and Bowan (2006) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yagan]] around Perth. Bennelong and a companion became the first Australians to sail to Europe, where they met [[King George III]]. Bungaree accompanied the explorer [[Matthew Flinders]] on the first circumnavigation of Australia. Pemulwuy was accused of the first killing of a white settler in 1790, and Windradyne resisted early British expansion beyond the Blue Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/firstaustralians/index/index/epid/1 |title=SBS.com.au |publisher=SBS.com.au |date= |accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the establishment of European settlement and their subsequent expansion, the indigenous populations were progressively forced into neighbouring territories,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} or subsumed into the new political entities of the Australian colonies. Violent conflict between [[Indigenous Australians]] and European settlers, described by some historians as [[Australian frontier wars|frontier wars]], arose out of this expansion: by the late 19th century, many populations had been forcibly relocated to land reserves and missions. The nature of many of these land reserves and missions enabled disease to spread quickly and many were closed as resident numbers dropped, with the remaining residents being moved to other land reserves and missions into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grey|first=Jeffrey|title=A Military History of Australia|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Port Melbourne|year=2008|edition=Third|isbn=978-0-521-69791-0|pages=28–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], in Australia during the colonial period: "In a thousand isolated places there were occasional shootings and spearings. Even worse, smallpox, measles, influenza and other new diseases swept from one Aboriginal camp to another&amp;nbsp;... The main conqueror of Aborigines was to be disease and its ally, demoralisation".&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Very Short History of the World; Penguin Books; 2004; ISBN 978-0-14-300559-9&lt;/ref&gt; 

From the 1830s, colonial governments established the now controversial offices of the [[Protector of Aborigines]] in an effort to avoid mistreatment of Indigenous peoples and conduct government policy towards them. [[Christianity in Australia|Christian churches]] sought to convert Aborigines, and were often used by government to carry out welfare and assimilation policies. Colonial churchmen such as Sydney's first Catholic archbishop, [[John Bede Polding]], strongly advocated for Aboriginal rights and dignity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/osullivan.rtf |title=Apsa2000.anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prominent Aboriginal activist [[Noel Pearson (Australian lawyer)|Noel Pearson]], who was raised at a [[Lutheran]] mission in [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]], has written that Christian missions throughout Australia's colonial history "provided a haven from the hell of life on the Australian frontier while at the same time facilitating colonisation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Noel Pearson |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/when-words-arent-enough/story-e6frg6z6-1111115528371 |title=Theaustralian.com.au |publisher=Theaustralian.com.au |date=12 February 2008 |accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Caledon Bay crisis]] of 1932-34 saw one of the last incidents of violent interaction on the "frontier" of indigenous and non-indigenous Australia, which began when the spearing of Japanese poachers who had been molesting [[Yolngu]] women was followed by the killing of a policeman. As the crisis unfolded, national opinion swung behind the Aboriginal people involved, and the first appeal on behalf of an [[Indigenous Australian]] to the [[High Court of Australia]] was launched. Following the crisis, the anthropologist [[Donald Thompson (anthropologist)|Donald Thompson]] was dispatched by the government to live among the Yolngu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dewar |first=Mickey |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/AS10126b.htm?hilite=dhakiyarr |title=ADB.online.anu.edu.au |publisher=ADB.online.anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere around this time, activists like Sir [[Douglas Nicholls]] were commencing their campaigns for Aboriginal rights within the established Australian political system and the age of frontier conflict closed.

Frontier encounters in Australia were not universally negative. Positive accounts of Aboriginal customs and encounters are also recorded in the journals of early European explorers, who often relied on Aboriginal guides and assistance: [[Charles Sturt]] employed Aboriginal envoys to explore the [[Murray-Darling]]; the lone survivor of the ill-fated [[Burke and Wills]] expedition, [[John King (explorer)|John King]], was helped by local Aborigines, and the famous tracker [[Jackey Jackey]] accompanied his ill-fated friend [[Edmund Kennedy]] to [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Respectful studies were conducted by such as [[Walter Baldwin Spencer]] and [[Frank Gillen]] in their renowned anthropological study ''[[The Native Tribes of Central Australia]]'' (1899); and by [[Donald Thompson (anthropologist)|Donald Thompson]] of [[Arnhem Land]] (c.1935-1943). In inland Australia, the skills of Aboriginal stockmen became highly regarded and in the 20th century, Aboriginal stockmen like [[Vincent Lingiari]] became national figures in their campaigns for better pay and conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naa.gov.au/about-us/publications/fact-sheets/fs224.aspx |title=NAA.gov.au |publisher=NAA.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2000, the Aboriginal Affairs Minister [[John Herron (Australian politician)|John Herron]], presented a report in the [[Australian Parliament]] that questioned whether there had been a "Stolen Generation", arguing that only 10% of Aboriginal children had been removed, and they did not constitute an entire "generation". The report received media attention and there were protests.&lt;ref name=730Report&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s115691.htm No stolen generation: Australian Govt], [[7:30 Report]] ABC TV 3 April 2000, retrieved 19 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 February 2008 Prime Minister Kevin Rudd presented an apology for the "Stolen Generation" as a [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/canberra/stories/s2160871.htm "The words Rudd will use to say 'sorry'"], ABC, 12 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/rudd-says-sorry/2008/02/13/1202760342960.html "Rudd says sorry"], Dylan Welch, ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 13 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent decades===
[[File:Douglas &amp; Gladys Nicholls statue.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Statue of Sir [[Douglas Nicholls]], former [[Governor of South Australia]].]]

Campaigns for indigenous rights in Australia have a long history. In the modern era, 1938 was an important year. With the participation of leading indigenous activists like [[Douglas Nicholls]], the ''[[Australian Aborigines Advancement League]]'' organised a protest "Day of Mourning" to mark the 150th anniversary of the arrival of the [[First Fleet]] of British in Australia and launched its campaign for full citizenship rights for all Aborigines. In the 1940s, the conditions of life for Aborigines could be very poor. A permit system restricted movement and work opportunities for many Aboriginal people. In the 1950s, the government pursued a policy of "assimilation" which sought to achieve full citizenship rights for Aborigines but also wanted them to adopt the mode of life of other Australians (which very often was assumed to require suppression of cultural identity).&lt;ref&gt;''The First Australians: A Fair Deal for a Dark Race'' par SBS TV 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s onwards, Australians began to rethink their attitudes towards racial issues. An Aboriginal rights movement was supported by many liberal white Australians and a campaign against the [[White Australia policy]] was also launched. In 1962, [[Robert Menzies]]' ''Commonwealth Electoral Act'' provided that all Indigenous people should have the right to enrol and vote at federal elections (prior to this, indigenous people in Queensland, Western Australia and "wards of the state" in the Northern Territory had been excluded from voting unless they were ex-servicemen). In 1965, Queensland became the last state to confer state voting rights on Aboriginal people.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htm |title=AEC.gov.au |publisher=AEC.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Bolton (1990) p.190&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum]] was held and overwhelmingly approved to amend the Constitution, removing discriminatory references and giving the national parliament the power to legislate specifically for [[Indigenous Australians]]. 

Various groups and individuals were active in the pursuit of equality and social justice from the 1960s. In the mid 1960s, one of the earliest Aboriginal graduates from the [[University of Sydney]], [[Charles N. Perkins|Charles Perkins]], helped organise [[Freedom Ride (Australia)|freedom rides]] into parts of Australia to expose discrimination and inequality. In 1966, the [[Gurindji strike|Gurindji]] people of Wave Hill station (owned by the [[Vestey Group]]) commenced strike action led by [[Vincent Lingiari]] in a quest for equal pay and recognition of land rights.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Bolton (1990) p.193 and 195&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous Australians began to take up representation in Australian parliaments during the 1970s. In 1971 [[Neville Bonner]] of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] was appointed by the Queensland Parliament to replace a retiring senator, becoming the first Aborigine in Federal Parliament. In 1976, Sir [[Douglas Nicholls]] was appointed [[Governor of South Australia]], becoming the first Aborigine to hold vice-regal office in Australia. [[Aden Ridgeway]] of the [[Australian Democrats]] served as a senator during the 1990s, but no indigenous person was elected to the House of Representatives, until West Australian [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] [[Ken Wyatt]], in August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htm |title=Electoral Milestone / Timetable for Indigenous Australians - Australian Electoral Commission |publisher=Aec.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the [[High Court of Australia]] handed down its decision in the [[Mabo v Queensland (No 2) (1992)|Mabo Case]], declaring the previous legal concept of ''terra nullius'' to be invalid. That same year, Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]] said in his [[Redfern Park Speech]] that European settlers were responsible for the difficulties Australian Aboriginal communities continued to face: "We committed the murders. We took the children from their mothers. We practiced discrimination and exclusion. It was our ignorance and our prejudice". In 1999 Parliament passed a [[Motion of Reconciliation]] drafted by Prime Minister [[John Howard]] and Aboriginal Senator [[Aden Ridgeway]] naming mistreatment of Indigenous Australians as the most "blemished chapter in our international history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkingfaith.org/articles/20080221_1.htm |title=The History of Apologies Down Under [Thinking Faith – the online journal of the British Jesuits&amp;#93; |publisher=Thinkingfaith.org |date= |accessdate=12 Oct. 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1960s, Australian writers began to re-assess European assumptions about Aboriginal Australia - with works including [[Alan Moorehead|Alan Moorehead's]] ''The Fatal Impact'' (1966) and [[Geoffrey Blainey|Geoffrey Blainey's]] landmark history ''Triumph of the Nomads'' (1975). In 1968, anthropologist [[Bill Stanner|W.E.H. Stanner]] described the lack of historical accounts of relations between Europeans and Aborigines as "the great Australian silence".&lt;ref&gt;Stanner, cited by Bain Attwood and S.G. Foster (eds) (2003)'' Frontier Conflict; The Australian Experience''. p.1 National Museum of Australia, Canberra. ISBN 1-876944-11-0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Evans and Bill Thorpe "Indigenocide and the massacre of Aboriginal History," in ''Overland'' magazine, No 163, Winter 2001.  ISBN 0-9577352-3-5&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] argues that there was a "historical neglect" of the Aborigines by historians until the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Reynolds (1989) ''Dispossession: Black Australians and White Invaders''. p.xiii. Allen and Unwin, NSW. ISBN 1-86448-141-2&lt;/ref&gt; Early commentaries often tended to describe Aborigines as doomed to extinction following the arrival of Europeans. William Westgarth’s 1864 book on the colony of Victoria observed; "the case of the Aborigines of Victoria confirms …it would seem almost an immutable law of nature that such inferior dark races should disappear."&lt;ref&gt;Westgarth cited in Richard Broome  and Alan Frost (1999) ''The Colonial Experience: The Port Phillip District 1834-1850''. p. 122. HTAV, Melbourne.  ISBN 1-86446-412-7&lt;/ref&gt;

A great many indigenous Australians have been prominent in sport and the arts in recent decades and Aboriginal art styles appreciated and embraced by the wider population, as with [[Albert Namatjira]]'s [[Hermannsburg School]], and the acrylic [[Papunya Tula]] "dot art" movement. [[Oodgeroo Noonuccal]] (1920–1995) was a famous Aboriginal poet, writer and rights activist credited with publishing the first Aboriginal book of verse: ''[[We Are Going]]'' (1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{en}}{{cite web |url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/poetry/index.htm |title=Modern Australian poetry |publisher=Ministère de la culture }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sally Morgan (artist)|Sally Morgan]]'s novel ''[[My Place (book)|My Place]]'' was considered a breakthrough memoir in terms of bringing indigenous stories to wider notice. 1976's [[The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith]] directed by [[Fred Schepisi]] was an award winning historical drama from a book by [[Thomas Keneally]] about the tragic story of an Aboriginal [[Bushranger]]. The canon of films related to Indigenous Australians also increased over the period of the 1990s and early 21st Century. In 1973 [[Arthur Beetson]] became the first Indigenous Australian to captain his country in any sport when he first led the Australian National Rugby League team, [[Australia national rugby league team|the Kangaroos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thekfaktor.com/speakers/nrl-legends/arthur-beetson-oam/beetson.pdf|title=Arthur Beetson OAM|accessdate=3 Mar. 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olympic gold medalist [[Cathy Freeman]] lit the Olympic flame at the [[2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]] in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianpolitics.com/news/2000/00-09-15.shtml |title=Cathy Freeman Lights Flame At Olympic Games Opening Ceremony [September 15, 2000&amp;#93; |publisher=Australianpolitics.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 21st century, much of indigenous Australia continued to suffer lower standards of health and education than non-indigenous Australia. In 2007, the ''[[Close the Gap campaign]]'' was launched by Olympic champions [[Cathy Freeman]] and [[Ian Thorpe]] with the aim of achieving Indigenous health equality within 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/btn/story/s2835261.htm |title=Behind the News - 09/03/2010: Close the Gap |publisher=Abc.net.au |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Northern Territory Intervention====

Prime Minister [[John Howard]] and Indigenous Affairs Minister [[Mal Brough]] launched the [[Northern Territory National Emergency Response]]. In response to the [[Little Children are Sacred]] Report into allegations of child abuse among indigenous communities in the Territory, the government banned alcohol in prescribed communities in the Northern Territory; quarantined a percentage of welfare payments for essential goods purchasing; despatched additional police and medical personnel to the region; and suspended the permit system for access to indigenous communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/one-policy-two-camps--the-takeover-rift/2007/10/26/1192941339555.html |title=SMH.au |work=Sydney Morning Herald  |date= 27 October 2007|accessdate=27 Jun. 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[James Anaya]], a [[United Nations]] Special Rapporteur, found the Emergency Response to be racially discriminating and infringe on the human rights of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Observations On The Northern Territory Emergency Response In Australia|url=http://www.un.org.au/files/files/United%20Nations%20Special%20Rapporteur%20-%20Feb%202010.pdf|first=James|last=Anaya|date=February 2010|accessdate=2011-06-18|author=Anaya, James|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anaya acknowledged that emergency action was needed but said that measures like banning alcohol and pornography and quarantining a percentage of welfare income for the purchase of essential goods represented a limitation on "individual autonomy".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2010/s2828921.htm&lt;/ref&gt; While finding some support among organisations like the [[Australian Greens]], the Report was widely condemned in Australia, with the [[Rudd Government]]'s Indigenous Affairs Minister, [[Jenny Macklin]], saying that her duty to protect the rights of children was paramount; Opposition Spokesman [[Tony Abbott]] querying whether Anaya had adequately consulted with people who had lived through the intervention; indigenous activist [[Warren Mundine]] saying the report should be "binned" and Central Australian Aboriginal leader [[Bess Price]] criticising the UN for not sending a female repporteur and said that Abaya had been led around by opponents of the intervention to meet with opponents of the intervention.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2009/s2670233.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/txt/s3182043.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====Native title====
{{Main|Native Title|Mabo v Queensland (No 1)|Mabo v Queensland (No 2)}}
[[Native title]] is a concept in the [[law of Australia]] that recognises in certain cases there was and is a continued beneficial legal interest in land held by local [[indigenous Australians]] which survived the acquisition of title to the land by the Crown at the time that the Crown acquired sovereignty of Australia.

==Immigrant communities==

===Early British and Irish settlers===

In the early decades of the establishment of British colonies in Australia, attitudes to race were imported from the British Isles. The ethnic mix of the early colonists consisted mainly of the four nationalities of the British Isles (England, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh), but also included some Jewish and black African convicts. [[Sectarianism]], particularly anti-Irish-Catholic sentiment was initially enshrined in law, reflecting the difficult position of Irish people within the British Empire. One-tenth of all the convicts who came to Australia on the First Fleet were Catholic and at least half of them were born in Ireland. With Ireland often in revolt against British rule, the Irish Catholics of Australia faced surveillance and were denied the public practice of their religion in the early decades of settlement.

Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] served as the last autocratic [[Governor of New South Wales]], from 1810 to 1821 and had a leading role in the social and economic development of New South Wales which saw it transition from a [[penal colony]] to a budding free society. He sought good relations with the Aborigines and upset British government opinion by treating [[emancipist]]s as equal to free-settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography

Plunkett twice charged the colonist perpetrators of the [[Myall Creek massacre]] of Aborigines with murder, resulting in a conviction and his landmark ''Church Act'' of 1836 [[State religion|disestablished]] the [[Church of England]] and established legal equality between [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglicans]], [[Catholicism in Australia|Catholics]], Presbyterians and later Methodists.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{cite web

While elements of sectarianism and anti-Irish sentiment persisted into the 20th century in Australia, the integration of the Irish, English, Scotch and Welsh nationalities was one the first notable successes of Australian immigration policy and set a pattern for later migrant intakes of suspicion of minorities giving way to acceptance.

===Australian gold-rushes===

The four nationalities of the British Isles continued to comprise the great majority of immigrants to Australia for some decades until the [[Australian goldrushes]] saw a massive surge in multinational [[immigration to Australia]]. Other than from Britain, immigrants came from continental Europe, North America and China. The Colony of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]’s population grew rapidly, from 76,000 in 1850 to 530,000 by 1859.&lt;ref&gt;C.M.H. Clark (1971) ''Select Documents in Australian History 1851-1900'' (Vol 2) p.664-5. Angus and Robertson, Sydney. ISBN 0-207-13426-X&lt;/ref&gt; Discontent arose amongst [[Diggings|diggers]] almost immediately, particularly on the crowded Victorian fields. The causes of this were the colonial government’s administration of the diggings and the gold licence system. Following a number of [[Ballarat Reform League|protests and petitions for reform]], violence erupted at [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]] in late 1854. 

Competition in the goldfields, labour disputes and Australian nationalism created an environment of racial antagonism during the second half of the 19th century. The Chinese mining population in particular was to suffer from racial resentment on the mining fields and the Australian colonies began to introduce restrictive immigration policies.

====Early Asian Immigration====
The Australian colonies had passed restrictive legislation as early as the 1860s, directed specifically at Chinese immigrants. Objections to the Chinese originally arose because of their large numbers, their religious beliefs and the view that they habitually engaged in gambling and smoking opium. It was also felt they would lower living standards, threaten democracy and that their numbers could expand into a "yellow tide".&lt;ref name="waywewere"&gt;{{cite book |title=The way we were.

Popular support for White Australia, always strong, was bolstered at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 when the Australian delegation led the fight to defeat a Japanese-sponsored racial-equality amendment to the League of Nations Covenant.&lt;ref name="white_britannica"&gt;{{cite book

===Federation and the White Australia Policy===

Following the establishment of autonomous parliaments, a rise in nationalism and improvements in transportation, the Australian colonies voted to unite in a Federation, which came into being in 1901. The [[Australian Constitution]] and early parliaments established one of the most progressive governmental systems on the earth at that time, with male and female suffrage and series of checks and balances built in to the governmental framework. National security fears had been one of the chief motivators for the union and legislation was quickly enacted to restrict non-European immigration to Australia - the foundation of the [[White Australia Policy]] - and voting rights for Aborigines were denied across most states.

The [[Barton Government|new Parliament]] quickly moved to restrict immigration to maintain Australia's "British character", and the Pacific Island Labourers Bill and the Immigration Restriction Bill were passed shortly before parliament rose for its first Christmas recess. Nevertheless, the Colonial Secretary in Britain made it clear that a race based immigration policy would run "contrary to the general conceptions of equality which have ever been the guiding principle of British rule throughout the Empire", so the [[Barton Government]] conceived of the "language dictation test", which would allow the government, at the discretion of the minister, to block unwanted migrants by forcing them to sit a test in "any European language". Race had already been established as a premise for exclusion among the colonial parliaments, so the main question for debate was who exactly the new Commonwealth ought to exclude, with the Labor Party rejecting Britain's calls to placate the populations of its non-white colonies and allow "aboriginal natives of Asia, Africa, or the islands thereof". There was opposition from Queensland and its sugar industry to the proposals of the Pacific Islanders Bill to exclude "Kanaka" laborers, however Barton argued that the practice was "veiled slavery" that could lead to a "negro problem" similar to that in the United States and the Bill was passed.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Carroll; From Barton to Fraser; Cassell Australia; 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

====Demise of White Australia Policy====

The restrictive measures established by the first parliament gave way to multi-ethnic immigration policies only after the [[Second World War]], with the "dictation test" itself being finally abolished in 1958 by the [[Menzies Government (1949–1966)|Menzies Government]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.immi.gov.au/media/fact-sheets/08abolition.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Menzies Government instigated migrants over all others since the time of Australian Federation in 1901 and abolished restrictions on voting rights for Aborigines, which had persisted in some jurisdictions. In 1950 External Affairs Minister [[Percy Spender]] instigated the [[Colombo Plan]], under which  students from Asian countries were admitted to study at Australian universities, then in 1957 non-Europeans with 15 years' residence in Australia were allowed to become citizens. In a watershed legal reform, a 1958  revision of the Migration Act introduced a simpler system for entry and abolished the "dictation test" which had permitted the exclusion of migrants on the basis of their ability to take down a dictation offered in ''any'' European language. Immigration Minister, Sir Alexander Downer, announced that  'distinguished and highly qualified Asians' might immigrate. Restrictions continued to be relaxed through the 1960s in the lead up to the [[Holt Government]]'s watershed ''Migration Act, 1966''.&lt;ref name="immi.gov.au"&gt;http://www.immi.gov.au/media/fact-sheets/08abolition.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Holt's government introduced the ''Migration Act 1966'', which effectively dismantled the [[White Australia Policy]] and increased access to non-European migrants, including refugees fleeing the [[Vietnam War]]. Holt also called the 1967 Referendum which removed the discriminatory clause in the [[Australian Constitution]] which excluded [[Aboriginal Australians]] from being counted in the census;– the referendum was one of the few to be overwhelmingly endorsed by the Australian electorate (over 90% voted 'yes').&lt;ref&gt;http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/holt/in-office.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal end of the White Australia Policy is usually placed in the year 1973, when the [[Whitlam Government|Whitlam Labor government]] implemented a series of amendments preventing the enforcement of racial aspects of the immigration law. These amendments:&lt;ref name="abolition"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Legislated that all migrants, regardless of origin, be eligible to obtain citizenship after three years of permanent residence.
* Ratified all international agreements relating to immigration and race.
* Issued policy to totally disregard race as a factor in selecting migrants.

The 1975 [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975|Racial Discrimination Act]] made the use of racial criteria  for any official purpose illegal (with the exception of census forms).

==Issues in contemporary Australia==
{{rewrite section|date=March 2012}}

Public planning to counter [[Ethnocentrism|cultural racism]] was ahead of its time in [[Western Sydney]], a suburban region with a long history of industrial production and migrant settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dowling|first=Robyn|last2=Fagan|first2=Bob|title=Neoliberalism and Suburban Employment: Western Sydney in the 1990s|journal=Geographical Research|volume=43|issue=1|pages=71–81|date=March 2005|doi=10.1111/j.1745-5871.2005.00298.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of its attempts to build an inclusive "cultural foundation" have been picked up by state governments, including council-funded social clubs for seniors, the provision of community services in major community languages, and the securing of places of worship through rezoning. All of these initiatives are aimed at public involvement rather than antiracist "integrating" strategies. 

[[Institutional racism]] is also seen in Australia within institutions, corporations, universities, etc. Government institutions are often cited racist with Indigenous people&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/ILB/2003/47.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/180_10_170504/hen10112_fm.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25754251-5006787,00.html | title=The Australian | date=9 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=May 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racial abuse and vilification is commonplace in Australian sport, according to a new report by the [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]] (HREOC).The report, What's the Score? A survey of cultural diversity and racism in Australian sport, says Aboriginal and other ethnic groups are under-represented in Australian sport, and suggests they are turned off organised sport because they fear [[racial vilification]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,22596894-23209,00.html Foxsports]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22598366-5001505,00.html The Australian]&lt;/ref&gt;

The inequalities suffered by Aborigines have long been widely documented by historians and reporters such as the journalist [[John Pilger]]. As noted by Professor [[Colin Tatz]] in an interview with Pilger, in relation to an IOC representative who was seemingly unaware of Aboriginal socio-economic conditions when sent to Australia to see whether or not it was a “fit and proper country” for hosting the Olympics:

“On the salt pan at Lombadina, Aborigines play with two saplings stuck in the ground. If he had inspected these conditions, he would have been looking at third- and fourth-world sporting facilities. He would have seen Aborigines kicking a piece of leather stuffed with paper because they don’t possess a single football or have access to the kind of sports facilities that every white Australian takes for granted, even in poor working-class suburbs where there is a municipal pool, a municipal ground, a cricket pitch or a tennis court or a park of some sort – these things are totally absent in 95 per cent of Aboriginal communitities.”&lt;ref&gt;The New Rulers Of The World by John Pilger&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the end of [[World War II]], Australia has had a programme of mass immigration that has led to an increase in the cultural diversity of its people. Some academics have argued that since the 1970s a policy of [[multiculturalism]] have played an important role in the relative peacefulness of Australian society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Pauline Hanson and One Nation ===
{{main|Pauline Hanson|One Nation (Australia)}}
Pauline Hanson was elected to the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Federal Parliament]] in 1996 and lost her seat in 1998. In her maiden speech to Parliament, Hanson said that "a multicultural country can never be a strong country", complained that Australia was in danger of being "swamped by Asians", and that these immigrants "have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australian-news.com.au/maiden_speech.htm |title=Pauline Hanon's Maiden Speech | accessdate=2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was widely accused of racism.

She helped form the [[One Nation Party]], which between 1998-2002 won a number of lower House seats in State Parliamentary elections, in [[Queensland state election, 1998|Queensland]], [[New South Wales state election, 1999|New South Wales]], and [[Western Australian state election, 2001|Western Australia]]. One Nation currently holds no seats in any Parliament in Australia. 

In 2006, as an ex politician, Pauline Hanson again achieved notoriety by asserting that Africans bring disease into Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/hanson-turns-on-diseased-africans/2006/12/06/1165081010724.html|title=Hanson turns on 'diseased' Africans | accessdate=2010-11-22|date=6 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cronulla riots ===
{{Main|2005 Cronulla riots}}
The [[2005 Cronulla riots|Cronulla riots of 2005]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/4520286.stm Racist violence in Cronulla beach, Sydney, Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; were a series of [[Racism|racially]] motivated mob confrontations which originated in and around [[Cronulla, New South Wales|Cronulla]], a beachfront suburb of [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], Australia. Soon after the riot, ethnically motivated violent incidents occurred in several other Sydney suburbs.

On Sunday, 11 December 2005, approximately 5000 people gathered to protest against alleged incidents of assaults and intimidatory behaviour by groups of  [[Middle East]]ern looking youths from the suburbs of [[South-western Sydney|South Western Sydney]]. The crowd initially assembled without incident, but violence broke out after a large segment of the mostly [[White people|white]]&lt;ref&gt;The term ''white'' in this context typically refers to Australian people of West European ancestry whose first language is English, see [[White people]].&lt;/ref&gt; crowd chased a man of [[Middle East]]ern appearance into a [[public house|hotel]] and two other youths of Middle Eastern appearance were assaulted on a train. 

The following nights saw several retaliatory violent assaults in the communities near Cronulla and Maroubra, large gatherings of protesters around south western Sydney, and an unprecedented police lock-down of [[Beaches in Sydney|Sydney beaches]] and surrounding areas, between [[Wollongong, New South Wales|Wollongong]] and [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]].

===UN report===
The [[UN]] [[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] in its report [http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Damning-UN-verdict-on-race-relations/2005/03/21/1111253958535.html SMH] released in 2005 was complimentary on improvements in race-related issues since its previous report five years prior, namely:   
* the criminalising of acts and incitement of racial hatred in most Australian States and Territories
* progress in the economic, social and cultural rights by indigenous peoples
* programmes and practices among the police and the judiciary, aimed at reducing the number of indigenous juveniles entering the criminal justice system
* the adoption of a Charter of Public Service in a Culturally Diverse Society to ensure that government services are provided in a way that is sensitive to the language and cultural needs of all Australians
*and the numerous human rights education programmes developed by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC).
 
The committee expressed concern about the abolishment of [[ATSIC]]; proposed reforms to [[HREOC]] that may limit its independence; the practical barriers Indigenous peoples face in succeeding in claims for native title; a lack of legislation criminalising serious acts or incitement of racial hatred in the Commonwealth, the State of [[Tasmania]] and the [[Northern Territory]]; and the inequities between Indigenous peoples and others in the areas of employment, housing, longevity, education and income.&lt;ref&gt;[[n:Australia silent on UN racism committee condemnation|Wikinews]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assaults against Indian students===
{{Main|2009 attacks on Indians in Australia}}

Australia is a popular and longstanding destination for international students. End of year data for 2009 found that of the 631,935 international students enrolled in Australia, drawn from more than 217 different countries, some 120, 913 were from India, making them the second largest group.&lt;ref name="embassy1"&gt;http://www.india.embassy.gov.au/ndli/study.html&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, protests were conducted in Melbourne by Indian students and widescale media coverage in India alleged that a series of robberies and assaults against Indian students should be ascribed to racism in Australia.&lt;ref name="embassy1"/&gt; According to a report tabled by the Overseas Indian Affairs Ministry, in all some 23 incidents were found to have involved "racial overtones" such as "anti Indian remarks".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indianexpress.com/news/only-23-of-152-oz-attacks-racist-ministry-tells-ls/584247/&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the [[Australian Institute of Criminology]] in consultation with the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] and Department of Immigration and Citizenship sought to quantify the extent to which Indians were the subject of crime in Australia and found overall that international students as recorded victims of crime in Australia, were either "less likely" or "as likely" to be victims of physical assault and other theft, but that there was a "substantial over-representation of Indian students in retail/commercial robberies". The report found however that the proficiency of Indians in the English language and their consequent higher engagement in employment in the services sector ("including service stations, convenience stores, taxi drivers and other employment that typically involves working late night shifts alone and come with an increased risk of crime, either at the workplace or while travelling to and from work") was a more likely explanation for the crime rate differential than was any "racial motivation".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/special/1-20/001/04_executive.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 May 2009, Indian students protested against what they claimed were racist attacks, blocking streets in central [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]]. Thousands of students gathered outside the Royal Melbourne Hospital where one of the victims was admitted. The protest, however, was called off early on the next day morning after the protesters accused police of "ramrodding" them to break up their sit-in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Indian-youths-detained-for-breaching-peace-march-in-Aus/469124/ expressindia.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
On 4 June 2009, China expressed concern over the matter - Chinese are the largest foreign student population in Australia with approximately 130,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/China-too-raises-concern-over-attacks-on-students/471165/ indianexpress.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In light of this event, the Australian Government started a Helpline for Indian students to report such incidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/national/helpline-thrown-to-indian-students-20090511-b0mt.html?page=-1 Helpline Thrown to Indian Students]: The Age&lt;/ref&gt;  Australian High Commissioner to India [[John McCarthy (ambassador born 1942)|John McCarthy]] said that there may have been an element of racism involved in some of the assaults reported upon Indians, but that they were mainly criminal in nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibnlive.in.com/news/australian-envoy-admits-attacks-on-indians-racist/94175-3.html Australian envoy admits attacks on Indians racist]: IBN Live&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]] High Commissioner for Human Rights, [[Navi Pillay]], termed these attacks "disturbing" and called for Australia to investigate the matters further.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report_un-asks-australia-to-investigate-root-cause-of-attacks-on-indian_1355539]&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of these attacks, other investigations alleged racist elements in the Victorian police force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8586435.stm | work=BBC News | title=Australia police in racism probe | date=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2011, the [[Australian Institute of Criminology]] released a study entitled ''Crimes Against International Students:2005-2009''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aic.gov.au/en/publications/current%20series/special/1-20/001/04_executive.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; This found that over the period 2005-2009, international students were statistically less likely to be assaulted than the average person in Australia. Indian students experienced an average assault rate in some jurisdictions, but overall they experienced lower assault rates than the Australian average. They did, however, experience higher rates of robbery, overall. The study could not sample incidents incidents of crime that were not reported. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/special/1-20/001/08_national.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, multiple surveys of international students over the period of 2009-10 found a majority of Indian students felt safe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/india-news/studies-show-most-indian-students-in-australia-feel-safe_100321118.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation relating to racism ==
===Racist legislation in Australian history===

Some notable legislation which might be said to be based on racist theory:

* ''[[Immigration Restriction Act 1901]]'', to prescribe where migrants to Australia were accepted from (this in part became the basis for the [[White Australia Policy]].)
*''[[Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901]]'' designed to facilitate the deportation of Pacific Island workers from Australia.
*''[[Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902]]'' gave women the vote across all states, but allowed states to restrict voting rights for "natives".

===Anti-racist legislation in contemporary Australia===

The following constituted important legal reforms in the movement towards racial equality:

* 1958 revision of the ''Migration Act'', introduced a simpler system for entry and abolished the "dictation test".
* 1962 ''Commonwealth Electoral Act'', provided that all Indigenous Australians should have the right to enrol and vote at federal elections (previously this right had been restricted in some states other than for Aboriginal ex-servicemen, who secured the right to vote in all states under 1949 legislation).
* ''[[Migration Act 1966]]'', effectively dismantled the White Australia Policy and increased access to non-European migrants.
* ''[[Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976]]'', was a significant step in legal recognition of Aboriginal land ownership.&lt;ref name="reconciliation1"/&gt;

The following Australian Federal and State legislation relates to racism and discrimination:

*Commonwealth [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]]
*Commonwealth [[Racial Hatred Act]] (1995)
*[[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act]] (1986)
*[[New South Wales]]: [[Anti-Discrimination Act]] (1977)
*[[South Australia]]: Equal Opportunity Act (1984) and [[Racial Vilification Act]] (1996)
*[[Western Australia]]: Equal Opportunity Act (1984) and Criminal Code
*[[Australian Capital Territory]]: Discrimination Act (1991)
*[[Queensland]]: [[Anti-Discrimination Act]] (1991)
*[[Northern Territory]]: [[Anti-Discrimination Act]] (1992)
*[[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]: Equal Opportunity Act (1995) and [[Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001]]
*[[Tasmania]]: [[Anti-Discrimination Act]] (1998)
