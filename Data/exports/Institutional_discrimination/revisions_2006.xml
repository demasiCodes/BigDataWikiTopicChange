'''Institutionalized discrimination''' is discrimination which has long been accepted as normal governmental operating procedures, laws, or objectives.

----

Examples of institutionalized discrimination include:

Laws and decisions that reflect racism, such as the [[Plessy vs. Ferguson]] supreme court case, which ruled in favor of separate but equal public facilities between African Americans and non-African Americans. This ruling was struck down by the [[Brown vs. Board of Education]] Supreme Court decision.


Laws that refuse equal legal rights solely based on race, gender, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation. These equal legal rights may encompass all areas of societal function, from the right to marry to the right to be treated equally by employers.</rev></revisions></page></pages></query></api>
