It stems from systemic stereotypical beliefs (such as sexist or racist beliefs) that are held by the vast majority living in a society where stereotypes and discrimination are the norm (see [[institutionalized racism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, E., Wilson, T. D., &amp; Akert, R. M. (2010). Social Psychology (7th edition). New York: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;
Such discrimination is typically codified into the operating procedures, policies, laws, or objectives of such institutions.{{cn|date=May 2020}}

Members of minority groups such as populations of [[African Americans|African descent]] in the [[Racism_and_ethnic_discrimination_in_the_United_States#Racism_against_African_Americans|U.S.]] are at a much higher risk of encountering these types of sociostructural disadvantage. Among the severe and long-lasting detrimental effects of institutionalized discrimination on affected populations are [[Suicide_among_LGBT_youth|increased suicide rates]], suppressed attainment of wealth and decreased access to health care.&lt;ref name="brandeis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iasp.brandeis.edu/pdfs/Author/shapiro-thomas-m/racialwealthgapbrief.pdf|date=2013-02-25|title=The Roots of the Widening Racial Wealth Gap: Explaining the Black-White Economic Divide|author1=Thomas Shapiro|author2=Tatjana Meschede|author3=Sam Osoro|publisher=Institute on Assets and Social Policy|location=Waltham, US|accessdate=2020-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-03-10-health-disparities_N.htm?csp=34|title=Minorities cite health care disparities|website=USATODAY.com|accessdate=2020-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional racism==
{{Main|Institutional racism}}
Institutional racism (also known as systemic racism) is a form of [[racism]] that is embedded as normal practice within [[society]] or an organization. It can lead to such issues as discrimination in [[criminal justice]], [[employment]], [[housing]], [[health care]], [[political power]], and [[education]], among other issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Harmon |first1=Amy |last2=Mandavilli |first2=Apoorva |last3=Maheshwari |first3=Sapna |last4=Kantor |first4=Jodi |title=From Cosmetics to NASCAR, Calls for Racial Justice Are Spreading |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/13/us/george-floyd-racism-america.html |work=The New York Times |date=13 June 2020 |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "institutional racism" was first coined in 1967 by [[Stokely Carmichael]] and [[Charles V. Hamilton]] in ''[[Black Power: The Politics of Liberation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bhavnani |first1=Reena |last2=Mirza |first2=Heidi Safia |last3=Meetoo |first3=Veena |title=Tackling the Roots of Racism: Lessons for Success |date=2005 |publisher=Policy Press |isbn=978-1-86134-774-9 |page=28 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KVbRVVHoKkQC&amp;pg=PA28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carmichael and Hamilton wrote that while individual racism is often identifiable because of its overt nature, institutional racism is less perceptible because of its "less overt, far more subtle" nature. Institutional racism "originates in the operation of established and respected forces in the society, and thus receives far less public condemnation than [individual racism]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carmichael |first1=Stokely |authorlink1=Stokely Carmichael |last2=Hamilton |first2=Charles V. |authorlink2=Charles V.
