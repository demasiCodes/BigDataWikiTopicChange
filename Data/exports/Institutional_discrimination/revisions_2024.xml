{{Discrimination sidebar|expanded=Forms}}
'''Institutional discrimination''' is [[discriminatory]] treatment of an individual or group of individuals by institutions, through unequal consideration of members of subordinate groups. 
'''Societal discrimination''' is discrimination by society. These unfair and indirect methods of discrimination are often embedded in an institution's policies, procedures, laws, and objectives. The discrimination can be on grounds of gender, caste, race, ethnicity, religion, disability, or socio-economic status.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, E., Wilson, T. D., &amp; Akert, R. M. (2010). Social Psychology (7th edition).

==Institutional racism==
{{Main|Institutional racism|Societal racism}}
Institutional racism (also known as systemic racism) is a form of institutional discrimination applied to [[Race (human categorization)|race]] and considered a form of [[racism]] that is embedded as normal practice within an institution.&lt;ref name="u736"&gt;{{cite web | title=Beyond Bakke: The Constitution and Redressing the Social History of Racism | journal=Harv.

The term "institutional racism" was first coined in 1967 by [[Stokely Carmichael]] and [[Charles V. Hamilton]] in ''[[Black Power: The Politics of Liberation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bhavnani |first1=Reena |last2=Mirza |first2=Heidi Safia |last3=Meetoo |first3=Veena |title=Tackling the Roots of Racism: Lessons for Success |date=2005 |publisher=Policy Press |isbn=978-1-86134-774-9 |page=28 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KVbRVVHoKkQC&amp;pg=PA28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carmichael and Hamilton wrote that while individual racism is often identifiable because of its overt nature, institutional racism is less perceptible because of its "less overt, far more subtle" nature. Institutional racism "originates in the operation of established and respected forces in the society, and thus receives far less public condemnation than [individual racism]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carmichael |first1=Stokely |authorlink1=Stokely Carmichael |last2=Hamilton |first2=Charles V. |authorlink2=Charles V.

Members of minority groups such as populations of [[African Americans|African descent]] in the [[Racism_and_ethnic_discrimination_in_the_United_States#Racism_against_African_Americans|U.S.]] are at a much higher risk of encountering these types of sociostructural disadvantage. Among the severe and long-lasting detrimental effects of institutionalized discrimination on affected populations are [[Suicide_among_LGBT_youth|increased suicide rates]], suppressed attainment of wealth and decreased access to health care.&lt;ref name="brandeis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iasp.brandeis.edu/pdfs/Author/shapiro-thomas-m/racialwealthgapbrief.pdf|date=2013-02-25|title=The Roots of the Widening Racial Wealth Gap: Explaining the Black-White Economic Divide|author1=Thomas Shapiro|author2=Tatjana Meschede|author3=Sam Osoro|publisher=Institute on Assets and Social Policy|location=Waltham, US|accessdate=2020-05-23|archive-date=2018-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024105941/http://iasp.brandeis.edu/pdfs/Author/shapiro-thomas-m/racialwealthgapbrief.pdf|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-03-10-health-disparities_N.htm?csp=34 |first1=Kevin |last1=Freking |title=Minorities cite health care disparities |website=USA TODAY |accessdate=2020-05-23 |archive-date=2022-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220926154647/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-03-10-health-disparities_N.htm?csp=34 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
