On {{nowrap|June 12}}, 2016, [[Omar Mateen]], a 29-year-old [[security guard]], killed 49 people and wounded 58 others in a [[Terrorism|terrorist attack]]/[[hate crime]] inside [[Pulse (nightclub)|Pulse]], a [[gay nightclub]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], United States. He was shot and killed by [[Orlando Police Department]] (OPD) officers after a three-hour standoff. Pulse was hosting a "Latin Night" and thus most of the victims were [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos]]. It is the deadliest incident of [[History of violence against LGBT people in the United States|violence against LGBT people]] in U.S. history, and the deadliest terrorist attack in the U.S. since the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001. At the time, it was the deadliest [[mass shooting]] by a single shooter in the U.S., being surpassed the following year by the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting|Las Vegas shooting]]. It remains the deadliest [[Mass shootings in the United States|U.S. mass shooting]] in which the perpetrator did not commit suicide.

In a [[9-1-1]] call shortly after the shooting began, Mateen [[Bay'ah|swore allegiance]] to the leader of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL), [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]], and said the shooting was "triggered" by the U.S. killing of [[Abu Waheeb]] in Iraq the previous month. He later told a negotiator he was "out here right now" because of the American-led interventions [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)|in Iraq]] and [[American-led intervention in Syria|in Syria]], and that the negotiator should tell the United States to stop bombing.

Initial reports said Mateen may have been a patron of the nightclub and used gay dating websites and apps, but [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) officials said they did not find any credible evidence to substantiate these claims. The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) also conducted an investigation and said it found no evidence of communications between ISIL and Mateen.

After the initial rounds of gunfire between Mateen and the security guard at Pulse, six officers, with at least a couple carrying assault rifles, shot out a large glass window and followed the sound of shooting to the bathroom area. When Mateen stuck his head out from one of the bathrooms, at least two officers shot at him.

At around {{nowrap|2:30 a.m.}}, Mateen's second wife—after receiving a call from her mother at approximately {{nowrap|2:00 a.m.}} asking where her husband was—sent a text message to Mateen asking where he was. Mateen texted back asking her if she had seen the news. After she replied, "No?", Mateen responded, "I love you, babe."

The FBI reported that no shots were heard between the time Mateen stopped exchanging gunfire with the first responders and {{nowrap|5:02 a.m.}}, when Orlando police breached the building's wall.&lt;ref name="fbitranscript" /&gt; Just before the breach, Mateen entered a women's bathroom where the hostages were hiding and opened fire, killing a man who sacrificed his life to save the woman behind him and at least one other, according to witnesses.&lt;ref name="WPPoliceResponse" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GMA.Recounts" /&gt;

At {{nowrap|5:07 a.m.}}, fourteen SWAT officers—after failing to blow open a big enough hole in the bathroom's exterior wall using a bomb—successfully breached the building when a policeman drove a [[BearCat]] armored vehicle through a wall in the northern bathroom.

After the shooting, the psychologist who reportedly evaluated and cleared Mateen for his firearms license in 2007 by G4S records denied ever meeting him or having lived in Florida at the time, and said she had stopped her practice in Florida since January 2006. G4S admitted Mateen's form had a "clerical error" and clarified that he had instead been cleared by another psychologist from the same firm that bought the wrongly-named doctor's practice.

In 2009, Mateen married his first wife, who left him after a few months; the couple's divorce became final in 2011.

Two former SWAT members, one an active-shooter tactics expert and trainer, expressed misgivings about the three-hour delay in breaching the nightclub, citing the lesson learned from other mass shootings that officers can minimize casualties only by entering a shooting location expeditiously, even if it means putting themselves at great risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pane |first=Lisa Marie |date=June 13, 2016 |title=Delayed police response in Florida shooting questioned |url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2016/06/13/orlando-shooting-police-response/85834624/ |work=The Detroit News |agency=Associated Press |access-date=June 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On {{nowrap|September 10}}, the [[Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services]] fined [[G4S Secure Solutions]] $151,400 for providing inaccurate psychological testing information on more than 1,500 forms over a ten-year period, which allowed employees to carry firearms.

On {{nowrap|November 4}}, it was reported that the Orlando Police Department was upgrading its equipment for officers following the shooting, since officers at the nightclub were not well-equipped for the event and therefore endangered. The upgraded equipment included bulletproof helmets and heavier bulletproof vests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wftv.com/news/9-investigates/orlando-police-upgrades-equipment-following-pulse-mass-shooting/464055241|title=Orlando police upgrades equipment following Pulse mass shooting|work=WFTV|date=November 4, 2016|accessdate=November 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the shooting and [[Ohio State University attack|a vehicle-ramming attack and mass stabbing]] at [[Ohio State University]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]], a new federal initiative was launched, partially in response to at least one victim bleeding to death inside Pulse during the shooting. The initiative was designed to train people working at schools and other public places on how to treat injuries before paramedics arrive at the scene. Doctors have emphasized the importance for school faculty members to stay calm and assess injuries, but also discouraged the use of more invasive emergency procedures such as removing a bullet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ohio-state-university-attack-need-training-ordinary-people-save-lives/|title=Ohio State University attack highlights need for training ordinary people to save lives|publisher=CBS News|agency=Associated Press|date=November 30, 2016|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victim assistance efforts===

On {{nowrap|November 8}} the City of Orlando announced its plans to purchase the Pulse nightclub later that month for $2.25 million and turn the site into a memorial for the victims and survivors of the shooting.

===Previous FBI investigations into Mateen===
Mateen became a [[person of interest]] to the FBI in May 2013 and July 2014. The 2013 investigation was opened after he made comments to coworkers about being a member of [[Hezbollah]] and having family connections in [[al-Qaeda]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line--&gt; |title=President Barack Obama and FBI say no clear evidence extremists directed Orlando killer |url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/president-barack-obama-and-fbi-say-no-clear-evidence-extremists-directed-orlando-killer-20160613-gpi99l.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=June 13, 2016 |access-date=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he had ties to [[Nidal Hasan]]—perpetrator of the [[2009 Fort Hood shooting]]—and [[Dzhokhar Tsarnaev|Dzhokhar]] and [[Tamerlan Tsarnaev]]—perpetrators of the [[Boston Marathon bombing]]. According to new documents released on {{nowrap|July 18}}, Mateen said that he made these comments in response to "a lot of harassment" and frequent derogatory epithets made by St. Lucie County Sheriff's deputies and his G4S coworkers, who taunted and made jokes about him being a possible Muslim extremist.&lt;ref name="New2013MateenTaunts"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line--&gt; |title=Docs: Pulse gunman Omar Mateen taunted at job for being Muslim |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/docs-pulse-gunman-omar-mateen-taunted-at-job-for-being-muslim/ |work=CBS News |date=July 18, 2016 |access-date=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YahooNoGoPostal"&gt;{{cite news |last=Walsh |first=Michael |date=July 19, 2016 |title=FBI did not think Orlando shooter Omar Mateen would 'go postal' in 2013 |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/fbi-did-not-think-orlando-shooter-omar-mateen-would-go-postal-in-2013-170929145.html |work=Yahoo!

The 2014 investigation was opened after he was linked to [[Moner Mohammad Abu Salha]],&lt;ref name="NYTimes.Early" /&gt; an [[Jihadist extremism in the United States|American radical]] who committed a [[suicide bombing]] in Syria. Mateen was interviewed three times in connection with the two investigations. Both cases were closed after finding nothing that warranted further investigation.&lt;ref name="ABCWhatWeKknow"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Katersky |first1=Aaron |last2=Meek |first2=James Gordon |last3=Margolin |first3=Josh |last4=Hayden |first4=Michael Edison |date=June 12, 2016 |title=What We Know About Omar Mateen, Suspected Orlando Nightclub Shooter |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/omar-mateen-suspected-orlando-night-club-shooter/story?id=39790797 |publisher=ABC News |access-date=June 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shabad"&gt;{{cite news |last=Shabad |first=Rebecca |date=June 13, 2016 |title=FBI Director Comey: "highly confident" Orlando shooter radicalized through internet |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-director-comey-highly-confident-orlando-shooter-radicalized-through-internet/ |publisher=CBS News |access-date=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line--&gt; |title=Mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/mass-shooting-at-pulse-nightclub-in-orlando-florida/news-story/134cfffa37beca5af509d96d840a5317 |work=The Australian |date=June 12, 2016 |access-date=June 12, 2016 |quote=The FBI has described the shooting as "an act of terrorism" and say they suspect the shooter had ties to radical Islam.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the shooting, Director Comey said the FBI will review its work and methods used in the two investigations. When asked if anything could have or should have been done differently in regard to Mateen, or the FBI's intelligence and actions in relation to him, Comey replied, "So far, the honest answer is, 'I don't think so'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dearen |first=Jason |last2=Harris |first2=Terrance |date=June 13, 2016 |title=Orlando mourns his dead; gunman may have been 'homegrown' |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2016-06-13/bodies-removed-after-worst-mass-shooting-in-us-history |publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report |agency=Associated Press |access-date=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A little over a month after the shooting, the FBI provided more details about its May 2013–March 2014 investigation into Mateen, which was closed after a veteran FBI agent assigned to the case and his supervisor concluded that "there was just nothing there" and removed his name from the Terrorist Watchlist. Mateen was interviewed twice during the investigation, and had provided a written statement in which he confessed that he had previously lied to FBI investigators. During the investigation, the FBI had tracked his daily routine using unmarked vehicles, closely examined his phone records, and used two informants to secretly record his face-to-face conversations. The FBI Director said that they could have taken more initiative in gaining access to his social media accounts in 2013, but noted that back then such checks were not yet "part of [their] investigative DNA". However, it would not have mattered, as the analysis of Mateen's computer after the shooting showed that his social media accounts, including Facebook, had no ties to any terrorist groups, and that he did not post any "radical statements" until the early morning of the shooting. The FBI in 2013 also did not have the [[probable cause]] needed to obtain a search warrant in order to secretly listen to his phone calls or probe into Mateen's computer.&lt;ref name="PastFBI2013"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilber |first=Del Quentin |date=July 14, 2016 |title=The FBI investigated the Orlando mass shooter for 10 months — and found nothing.

On {{nowrap|July 26}}, a Senate homeland security committee chairman sent a four-page letter to the inspector general of the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] (DOJ) requesting an independent review of the FBI's 2013 and 2014 investigations. He wrote that if Mateen had stayed on the FBI watch-list, the federal agency would have been notified if he tried to purchase firearms, in which case the "law enforcement potentially could have uncovered information on social media or elsewhere of Mateen's radicalization".&lt;ref name="GetFBIReviewed"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cherney |first=Elyssa |date=July 27, 2016 |title=Senator: FBI investigations into Pulse gunman need review |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/pulse-orlando-nightclub-shooting/investigation/os-inspector-general-pulse-mateen-20160727-story.html |newspaper=Orlando Sentinel |access-date=July 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On {{nowrap|July 13}}, Special Agent in Charge Danny Banks of Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) said that it expects to finish its investigation into the shooting in about a month. FDLE's role was to find out whether the officers who fired upon Mateen did so within legal bounds. At the time, Mateen's wife was still under investigation, no arrests were made, and no other motive had been determined. Officials have not confirmed the "speculation that Mateen lashed out because he was gay or had animosity toward gay or Latino people". As paraphrased, Banks said it was unclear "why Mateen chose to attack Pulse." On {{nowrap|August 24}}, the FDLE finished its investigation into Mateen's death, but did not release the records to the public as "the case will remain an open investigation until prosecutors make their decision". The case and its findings were turned over to The Office of the State Attorney for the Ninth Judicial Circuit, which will, according to its state attorney's spokeswoman, "evaluate the [officers'] use of force and whether it was appropriate under Florida law"; it will also determine whether to file any charges against the officers involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lotan |first=Gal Tziperman |date=August 24, 2016 |title=FDLE turns over Pulse shooter investigation to state attorney |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/pulse-orlando-nightclub-shooting/investigation/os-fdle-pulse-shooting-omar-mateen-investigation-20160824-story.html |work=Orlando Sentinel |access-date=August 24, 2016 |quote='We will evaluate the use of force and whether it was appropriate under Florida law,' said state attorney's spokeswoman Angela Starke.

In mid-July, law enforcement officials reported that the FBI—after conducting "interviews&lt;ref&gt;Some to all of these interviews were with witnesses to the shooting. The cited source is unclear on the matter.&lt;/ref&gt; and an examination of his computer and other electronic media"—has not found any evidence that Mateen targeted Pulse because the nightclub was a venue for gays or whether the attack was motivated by homophobia. According to witnesses, he did not make any homophobic comments during the shooting. Also, nothing has been found that confirms the speculation that he was gay and used gay dating apps; however, the FBI "has found evidence that Mateen was cheating on his wife with other women". Officials noted that "there is nothing to suggest that he attempted to cover up his tracks by deleting files". Generally, "a complete picture of what motivated Mateen remains murky and may never be known since he was killed in a shootout with police and did not leave a manifesto".&lt;ref name="FBINoEvidence"&gt;{{cite news |last=Goldman |first=Adam |date=July 15, 2016 |title=FBI has found no evidence that Orlando shooter targeted Pulse because it was a gay club |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/no-evidence-so-far-to-suggest-orlando-shooter-targeted-club-because-it-was-gay/2016/07/14/a7528674-4907-11e6-acbc-4d4870a079da_story.html |work=The Washington Post |access-date=July 16, 2016 |quote=The FBI, however, has been unable to verify that Mateen used gay dating apps and instead has found evidence that Mateen was cheating on his wife with other women.

On {{nowrap|September 29}}, an imam for a mosque in [[Kissimmee, Florida|Kissimmee]] released video footage showing what appeared to be Mateen on {{nowrap|June 8}}, four days before the shooting, praying for about ten minutes. The imam said Mateen was praying there with his wife and child, and had no verbal exchanges with any of the other attendants. Though the FBI was already in possession of the mosque's security recordings, the video footage was released to the public only after [[2016 New York and New Jersey bombings|a series of bombings or bombing attempts in New York and New Jersey]], and [[St. Cloud, Minnesota mall stabbing|a mass stabbing at a Minnesota shopping mall]] in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/religion/religion-world/os-kissimmee-islamic-center-mateen-video-the-american-muslim-leadership-council-20160928-story.html|title=Imam: Omar Mateen prayed at Kissimmee mosque days before attack|work=Orlando Sentinel|date=September 28, 2016|accessdate=September 29, 2016|first=Bethany|last=Rodgers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On {{nowrap|April 13}}, 2017, OPD Chief John Mina released a 78-page presentation to ten police groups located around the world, which discussed the OPD's response to the attack and what it has learned. The presentation offered a comprehensive timeline of the attack and included diagrams and still photos from [[body camera]] footage showing officers in their initial confrontation with Mateen. Also according to the presentation, 500 interviews were conducted, 1,600 leads were followed up on, more than 950 pieces of evidence were collected, and more than 300 people were subpoenaed.&lt;ref name=orlandosentinel1/&gt;

On {{nowrap|August 24}}, 2017, the [[Florida Department of Law Enforcement]] (FDLE), a Florida government agency, released a 35-page after-action report about its response to the nightclub during the shooting. In the report, the FDLE detailed its inability to notify the families of deceased victims, as well as the complications arising from its inter-agency policies, which led to them not immediately sharing information about the shooting to the federal government. The report concluded that, overall, the FDLE handled its response to the shooting well despite its need of resources to respond to such a situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/pulse-orlando-nightclub-shooting/os-pulse-orlando-fdle-after-action-report-20170809-story.html|title=Pulse nightclub shooting: FDLE releases review of agency's response, recommends changes|work=Orlando Sentinel|date=August 24, 2017|accessdate=November 10, 2017|first=Christal|last=Hayes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
