The early 21st century saw a rise in and increasing organisation around anti-transgender sentiments in the United Kingdom, the most common strain being that of [[gender-critical feminism]]. This has led to some referring to the United Kingdom by the nickname "TERF Island".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Baska |first=Maggie |date=1 October 2021 |title=Transphobia scholar explains why 'the UK became TERF island' – and it's eye-opening |url=https://www.thepinknews.com/2021/10/01/transphobia-uk-terf-island-tiktok/ |access-date=31 October 2024 |website=PinkNews {{!}} Latest lesbian, gay, bi and trans news {{!}} LGBTQ+ news |language=en-US |archive-date=7 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230607041825/https://www.thepinknews.com/2021/10/01/transphobia-uk-terf-island-tiktok/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{See also|Transgender rights in the United Kingdom}}

=== Gender Recognition Act 2004 ===
{{Main article|Gender Recognition Act 2004}}

In 1970, a judge ruled that transgender people could not change the sex listed on their birth certificate. Following cases by trans rights organizations, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] issued a ruling that the UK government's policy was in breach of human rights. This led to the implementation of the 2004 Gender Recognition Act (GRA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Prosser |first=Jay |date=10 August 2022 |title=Trans rights and political backlash: five key moments in history |url=https://theconversation.com/trans-rights-and-political-backlash-five-key-moments-in-history-187476 |access-date=31 October 2024 |language=en-US |archive-date=1 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240601015707/https://theconversation.com/trans-rights-and-political-backlash-five-key-moments-in-history-187476 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The GRA allowed trans people to change their legal sex with the requirement they be medically diagnosed with gender dysphoria and having lived for two years as their "acquired" gender.&lt;ref name="Dunne"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Dunne |first=Peter |date=30 May 2023 |title=Why outside experts are worried about the decline of LGBTI rights in the UK |url=https://theconversation.com/why-outside-experts-are-worried-about-the-decline-of-lgbti-rights-in-the-uk-205707 |access-date=31 October 2024 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2020, the [[European Commission]] argued these to be "intrusive medical requirements" out of line with international human rights standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Legal gender recognition in the EU: the journeys of trans people towards full equality |url=https://igualtat.gencat.cat/web/.content/Ambits/LGBTI/normativaLGBTI/Document-EU-autodeterminacio-de-genere-2020.pdf |website=European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2021, the House of Commons women and equalities committee and the United Nations Independent Expert on sexual orientation and gender identity concurred and called for [[gender self-identification]] to be the policy.&lt;ref name="Dunne"/&gt;

==Rise in anti-trans sentiments==

In 2016, the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]' [[Women and Equalities Committee]] issued a report recommending that the [[Gender Recognition Act 2004]] be updated "in line with the principles of [[gender self-declaration]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmselect/cmwomeq/390/39010.htm#_idTextAnchor213|title=Transgender Equality|last1=Women and Equalities Committee|date=8 January 2016|publisher=House of Commons|quote=Within the current Parliament, the Government must bring forward proposals to update the Gender Recognition Act, in line with the principles of gender self-declaration that have been developed in other jurisdictions.

This proposed reform became a key locus of conflict for the emerging gender-critical movement, seeking to block reform of the Act; however, a significant majority of respondents were in favour of the GRA reforms in 2018.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/response-to-the-gender-recognition-act-2004-consultation |title=Reform of the Gender Recognition Act — Analysis of consultation responses |first1=Daniel |last1=King |author2=Carrie Paechter |author3=Maranda Ridgway |publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]] |date=22 September 2020 |access-date=21 October 2021 |id=CP&amp;nbsp;294 |pages=8–9 |archive-date=5 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201005045042/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/response-to-the-gender-recognition-act-2004-consultation |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key locus of conflict for the emerging movement was the stance of LGBTQ rights charity [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]] on trans issues. In 2015, Stonewall had begun campaigning for trans equality, with Stonewall head [[Ruth Hunt]] apologising for the organisation's previous failure to do so.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gani|first1=Aisha|title=Stonewall to start campaigning for trans equality|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/16/stonewall-start-campaigning-trans-equality|access-date=31 May 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=16 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426042549/http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/16/stonewall-start-campaigning-trans-equality|archive-date=26 April 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Media involvement===

Beginning in the late 2010s, British media outlets across the political spectrum began publishing articles positioning transgender rights as being directly at odds with the rights of women and children.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news |last=John |first=Tara |date=4 April 2020 |title=The quest for trans rights has exposed a deep divide in the UK.

Other news outlets that took part included [[Sky News]], ''[[The Guardian]]'', and the BBC.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Burns would later describe this as a "trans backlash" stemming from 2015.&lt;ref name="PS"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Burns |first1=Christine |title=Witness Statement re Edinburgh Employment Tribunal involving Katherine O'Donnell |date=9 May 2019 |url= https://blog.plain-sense.co.uk/2019/05/the-statement-below-is-written-evidence_9.html |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20201029234438/http://blog.plain-sense.co.uk/2019/05/the-statement-below-is-written-evidence_9.html |archive-date=29 October 2020 |access-date=16 October 2020 |website=Just Plain Sense}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2020, the [[Independent Press Standards Organisation]] released a report stating that the average number of UK media stories about trans rights had jumped 414% between May 2014 and May 2019, from 34 per month to 176 per month, and that in the preceding year of research that number had risen to 224 stories per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Tobitt |first1=Charlotte |date=10 December 2020 |title=Report charts UK press coverage of trans issues becoming more respectful yet 'heated' |url=https://pressgazette.co.uk/report-ten-year-uk-press-coverage-trans-issues-respectful-yet-heated/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220701182247/https://pressgazette.co.uk/report-ten-year-uk-press-coverage-trans-issues-respectful-yet-heated/ |archive-date=1 July 2022 |access-date=22 July 2022 |work=Press Gazette |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organisations founded ===
In 2019, the [[LGB Alliance]] was founded in opposition to Stonewall's 2015 pivot towards supporting trans rights, accusing the organisation of having "undermined women's sex-based rights and protections" and attempting "to introduce confusion between biological sex and the notion of gender".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Hellen |first=Nicholas |date=22 September 2019 |title='Anti-women' trans policy may split Stonewall |url= https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/anti-women-trans-policy-may-split-stonewall-wfv2rp5cx |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210201130445/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/anti-women-trans-policy-may-split-stonewall-wfv2rp5cx |archive-date=1 February 2021 |access-date=13 February 2021 |work=The Sunday Times |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The year 2019 also saw the formation of the [[Women's Declaration International]] (formed as Women's Human Rights Campaign) by noted gender-critical feminist [[Sheila Jeffreys]] and co-founder Heather Brunskell-Evans. The group published a manifesto titled the ''Declaration on Women's Sex-Based Rights'', which argued that recognising trans women as women "constitutes discrimination against women" and called for the "elimination of that act".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MPs urged by anti-trans 'women's rights' group to eliminate 'transgenderism' and scrap Gender Recognition Act |date=27 January 2021 |url= https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/01/27/womens-human-rights-campaign-gender-recognition-act-inquiry-trans-transphobia/ |first=Vic |last=Parsons |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20220922041648/https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/01/27/womens-human-rights-campaign-gender-recognition-act-inquiry-trans-transphobia/ |archive-date=22 September 2022 |access-date=2 December 2021 |work=Pink News |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Declaration on Women's Sex-Based Rights: Full Text |publisher= Women's Declaration International |location= Suffolk UK |date=n.d. |url= https://www.womensdeclaration.com/en/declaration-womens-sex-based-rights-full-text/ |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20211207043837/https://womensdeclaration.com/en/declaration-womens-sex-based-rights-full-text/ |archive-date=7 December 2021 |access-date=8 December 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2021, the group [[Genspect]] was founded in close affiliation with the American lobby group The [[Society for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine]] (SEGM) - both of which have since been designated as [[List of organizations designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as anti-LGBTQ hate groups#Genspect and Society for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine|anti-LGBTQ hate groups]] by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]]; and both of whose activities focused primarily on lobbying, within politics and medicine, against access to gender affirming care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=5 June 2024 |title=Genspect, SEGM designated anti-LGBTQ hate groups by SPLC |url=https://www.losangelesblade.com/2024/06/05/genspect-segm-designated-anti-lgbtq-hate-groups-by-splc/ |access-date=30 October 2024 |website=Los Angeles Blade |archive-date=5 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240605223133/https://www.losangelesblade.com/2024/06/05/genspect-segm-designated-anti-lgbtq-hate-groups-by-splc/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Dixon |first=Hayley |date=26 June 2021 |title=CBBC's trans messaging is damaging children, says mother |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/06/26/cbbcs-trans-messaging-damaging-children-says-mother/ |access-date=30 October 2024 |work=The Telegraph |location=London |archive-date=23 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210923005841/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/06/26/cbbcs-trans-messaging-damaging-children-says-mother/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=26 December 2022 |title=La Comisión Europea investigará los cambios de sexo sin control como los que promueve la 'ley trans' |url=https://okdiario.com/espana/comision-europea-investigara-cambios-sexo-sin-control-como-que-promueve-ley-trans-10202105 |access-date=31 October 2024 |website=okdiario.com |language=es |archive-date=9 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230109201949/https://okdiario.com/espana/comision-europea-investigara-cambios-sexo-sin-control-como-que-promueve-ley-trans-10202105 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Baitinger |first=Brooke |date=3 August 2022 |title=Showdown: LGBTQ+ rights vs. state ban on transition-related medical care for trans kids • Florida Phoenix |url=https://floridaphoenix.com/2022/08/03/showdown-lgbtq-rights-vs-state-ban-on-transition-related-medical-care-for-trans-kids/ |access-date=31 October 2024 |website=Florida Phoenix |archive-date=23 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220823152501/https://floridaphoenix.com/2022/08/03/showdown-lgbtq-rights-vs-state-ban-on-transition-related-medical-care-for-trans-kids/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy changes ==

=== Legal status of gender-critical beliefs ===
In 2021, it was ruled in the landmark case [[Forstater v Centre for Global Development Europe]] that gender-critical beliefs are "worthy of respect" and qualify for discrimination protections on the same level as religion; but while this ruling made such views a protected belief, it did not grant the right for holders of such beliefs to discriminate against transgender people themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=24 June 2021 |title=Louise Usher: Forstater v CGD Europe – are gender critical beliefs protected under the Equality Act? |url=https://www.scottishlegal.com/articles/louise-usher-forstater-v-cgd-europe-are-gender-critical-beliefs-protected-under-the-equality-act |access-date=31 October 2024 |website=Scottish Legal News |language=en |archive-date=11 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231211214851/https://www.scottishlegal.com/articles/louise-usher-forstater-v-cgd-europe-are-gender-critical-beliefs-protected-under-the-equality-act |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maya Forstater]], the plaintiff, had sued her employer, the Center for Global Development Europe, for not having her employment contract renewed after expressing gender-critical beliefs.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news |date=10 June 2021 |title=Maya Forstater: Woman wins tribunal appeal over transgender tweets |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-57426579 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220115003307/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-57426579 |archive-date=15 January 2022 |accessdate=21 March 2023 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 2021, the British [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] (EHRC) submitted evidence backing Maya Forstater in ''Forstater v Center for Global Development Europe''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The EHRC issued a statement saying, "We think that a 'gender critical' belief that 'trans women are men and trans men are women' is a philosophical belief which is protected under the Equality Act".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Parsons |first=Vic |date=29 April 2021 |title=UK equality watchdog thinks it should be legal to misgender trans people |url=https://www.thepinknews.com/2021/04/29/maya-forstater-appeal-trans-transphobia-gender-critical-equality-act-ehrc/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230321200328/https://www.thepinknews.com/2021/04/29/maya-forstater-appeal-trans-transphobia-gender-critical-equality-act-ehrc/ |archive-date=21 March 2023 |accessdate=21 March 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender Recognition ===

In the late 2010s, a number of groups were formed in response to the proposed GRA reform, including [[Fair Play for Women]], [[For Women Scotland]], and [[Woman's Place UK]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In January 2022, the EHRC released dual statements opposing the removal of administrative barriers for trans people to receive legal recognition in Scotland, and asking that England and Wales' ban on conversion therapy exclude such therapies for trans people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2 February 2022 |title=Britain's Equalities Watchdog Met Privately With Anti-Trans Groups |url= https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxdzwn/ehrc-trans-rights-leaked-emails |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20230309114425/https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxdzwn/ehrc-trans-rights-leaked-emails |archive-date=9 March 2023 |access-date=21 March 2023 |website=www.vice.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=26 January 2022 |title=Call for rethink of Scottish gender recognition reforms |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-60141382 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20230322192428/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-60141382 |archive-date=22 March 2023 |access-date=21 March 2023 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, ''Vice News'' reported on leaked sections of an unpublished 2021 EHRC guidance pack, which advised businesses and organisations to exclude transgender people from single-sex spaces – including toilets, hospital wards, and changing rooms – unless they held a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC). ''Vice'' reported that the guidance, due to be released in January 2022 but unpublished {{as of|February 2022|lc=y}}, was aimed at "[protecting] women", and that just 1% of trans people in the UK held a GRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=10 February 2022 |title=Leaked EHRC Guidance Reveals Plans to Exclude Most Trans People From Bathrooms |url= https://www.vice.com/en/article/3ab5my/leaked-ehrc-guidance-trans-people-gender-recognition-certificates |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20230309114441/https://www.vice.com/en/article/3ab5my/leaked-ehrc-guidance-trans-people-gender-recognition-certificates |archive-date=9 March 2023 |access-date=21 March 2023 |website=www.vice.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2022, the EHRC stated that transgender people could be excluded from single-sex spaces as long as it serves a legitimate aim, such as "privacy, decency, to prevent trauma or to ensure health and safety".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Syal |first1=Rajeev |date=4 April 2022 |title=Trans people can be excluded from single-sex services if 'justifiable', says EHRC |url= https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/04/trans-people-can-be-excluded-single-sex-services-if-justifiable-says-ehrc |access-date=31 October 2024 |work=The Guardian |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In July 2024, the EHRC released guidance clarifying that sex-based occupational requirements included sex as modified by a GRC, but that under schedule 9 of the [[Equality Act 2010]] employers were permitted to exclude transgender persons even with a GRC. The guidance stated that the basis and reasons for any occupational restrictions should be clearly stated in any advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Moss |first=Rob |date=16 July 2024 |title=EHRC updates guidance on discriminatory adverts |url=https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/ehrc-updates-guidance-on-discriminatory-adverts-sex-transgender-self-id/ |access-date=17 July 2024 |website=Personnel Today |archive-date=17 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240717030633/https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/ehrc-updates-guidance-on-discriminatory-adverts-sex-transgender-self-id/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Guidance on discriminatory adverts |publisher= Equality and Human Rights Commission |location= Manchester |url= https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/guidance/guidance-discriminatory-adverts |access-date= 17 July 2024 |date= 16 July 2024 |archive-date= 17 July 2024 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20240717052617/http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/guidance/guidance-discriminatory-adverts |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conversion Therapy ===
{{Main|Transgender rights in the United Kingdom#Conversion Therapy}}
In 2015, health organizations across the UK came together to sign the [[Memorandum of Understanding on Conversion Therapy]] (MoU), a statement outlining their opposition to conversion therapy for LGB people. It was updated to include conversion therapy for transgender people in 2017.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=Talen |last2=Candy |first2=Bridget |last3=King |first3=Michael |date=1 December 2018 |title=Conversion therapies and access to transition-related healthcare in transgender people: a narrative systematic review |url=https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/12/e022425 |journal=BMJ Open |volume=8 |issue=12 |pages=e022425 |doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2018-022425 |issn=2044-6055 |pmc=6318517 |pmid=30580262 |access-date=4 November 2024 |archive-date=4 October 2024 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20241004225751/https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/12/e022425 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2022, the Conservative government under [[Boris Johnson]] backtracked on plans to include conversion therapy suppressing gender identity from an upcoming bill banning the practice following pressure from [[gender-critical]] lobbying groups. The coalition behind the MoU published an open letter condemning the decision and the government had to cancel its first LGBTQ conference as the members dropped out in protest. Gender critical campaign group [[Transgender Trend]] criticized the letter, citing the [[Cass Review]]'s interim report.&lt;ref name="Parry"&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Parry |first1=Josh |last2=Moss |first2=Lauren |date=6 April 2022 |title=Mental health groups call for trans conversion therapy ban |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-61018404 |access-date=30 October 2024 |work=BBC News |archive-date=27 September 2024 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20240927155841/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-61018404 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cass Review's interim report argued affirmative approaches aren't neutral, stated professionals were scared to take an "an exploratory approach or challenging approach due to perceived pressures from what some participants described as organisations taking an 'ideological stance'" and stated "This can lead to a fear of being labelled transphobic if the professional suggests that it may be worthwhile trying to understand the possible meaning or origin of gender non-conformity in the child."&lt;ref name="Horton"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Horton |first=Cal |date=14 March 2024 |title=The Cass Review: Cis-supremacy in the UK's approach to healthcare for trans children |url= https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/26895269.2024.2328249 |journal= International Journal of Transgender Health |pages=1–25 |doi=10.1080/26895269.2024.2328249 |issn=2689-5269 |access-date=4 November 2024 |archive-date=12 July 2024 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20240712215634/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/26895269.2024.2328249 |url-status=live |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adu"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hilary Cass warns Kemi Badenoch over risks of conversion practices ban |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/11/hilary-cass-warns-kemi-badenoch-over-risks-of-conversion-practices-ban |work=The Guardian |location= London |first1=Aletha |last1=Adu |first2=Amelia |last2=Gentleman |date=11 April 2024 |access-date=14 April 2024 |archive-date=3 July 2024|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20240703233057/https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/11/hilary-cass-warns-kemi-badenoch-over-risks-of-conversion-practices-ban|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2024 Hilary Cass, who chaired the Review, told [[Kemi Badenoch]] that the proposed conversion therapy ban was risky and told the guardian that she'd been "really clear with the government that any legislation would have to take inordinate care to not make workforce problems worse than they are".&lt;ref name="adu"/&gt;

In 2022, the [[World Professional Association for Transgender Health]] (WPATH) and regional transgender health bodies released a statement in response to NHS Englands interim service specifications which followed the Cass Review's interim report.&lt;ref name="WPATH-NHS"&gt;{{Cite web |date=25 November 2022 |title=WPATH, ASIAPATH, EPATH, PATHA, and USPATH Response to NHS England in the United Kingdom (UK) |url=https://www.wpath.org/media/cms/Documents/Public%20Policies/2022/25.11.22%20AUSPATH%20Statement%20reworked%20for%20WPATH%20Final%20ASIAPATH.EPATH.PATHA.USPATH.pdf?_t=1669428978 |website=[[WPATH]] |access-date=2 January 2024 |archive-date=30 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221130183416/https://www.wpath.org/media/cms/Documents/Public%20Policies/2022/25.11.22%20AUSPATH%20Statement%20reworked%20for%20WPATH%20Final%20ASIAPATH.EPATH.PATHA.USPATH.pdf?_t=1669428978 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bharat"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bharat |first1=Bharat |last2=Dopp |first2=Alex |last3=Last |first3=Briana |last4=Howell |first4=Gary |last5=Nadeem |first5=Erum |last6=Johnson |first6=Clara |last7=Stirman |first7=Shannon Wiltsey |title=OSF |url=https://osf.io/gz5mk/ |journal=The Behavior Therapist |publisher=Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies |publication-date=October 2023 |volume=46 |issue=7 |doi=10.31234/osf.io/gz5mk |access-date=1 January 2024 |archive-date=24 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240924070611/https://osf.io/gz5mk/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement argued 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This document seems to view gender incongruence largely as a mental health disorder or a state of confusion and withholds gender-affirming treatments on this basis. WPATH, ASIAPATH, EPATH, PATHA, and USPATH call attention to the fact that this "psychotherapeutic" approach, which was used for decades before being superseded by evidence-based gender-affirming care, has not been shown to be effective (AUSPATH, 2021; Coleman et al., 2022). Indeed, the denial of gender-affirming treatment under the guise of "exploratory therapy" has caused enormous harm to the transgender and gender diverse community and is tantamount to "conversion" or "reparative" therapy under another name.&lt;ref name="WPATH-NHS"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[Professional Association for Transgender Health Aotearoa]] (PATHA), a New Zealand professional organisation, said that the Cass Review made "harmful recommendations" and was not in line with international consensus, and that "Restricting access to social transition is restricting [[gender expression]], a natural part of human diversity." They further said that several people involved in the review "previously advocated for bans on [[gender-affirming care]] in the United States, and have promoted non-affirming '[[Conversion therapy#Gender exploratory therapy|gender exploratory therapy]]', which is considered a conversion practice."&lt;ref name="patha"&gt;{{cite press release |date=11 April 2024 |title=Cass Review out of step with high-quality care provided in Aotearoa |url= https://patha.nz/News/13341582 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20240411012336/https://patha.nz/News/13341582 |archive-date=11 April 2024 |access-date=11 April 2024 |website=[[PATHA]] – Professional Association for Transgender Health Aotearoa }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2023, the [[UK Council for Psychotherapy]] (UKCP) published a statement on [[gender-critical]] views that "Psychotherapists and psychotherapeutic counsellors who hold such views are likely to believe that the clinically most appropriate approach to working therapeutically with individuals who present with gender dysphoria, particularly children and young people, is [[gender exploratory therapy|exploratory therapy]], rather than medicalised interventions such as puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones or reassignment surgery."&lt;ref name="Broughton"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Broughton |first=Ellie |date=9 April 2024 |title=The group trying to quietly rebrand conversion "therapy" |url=https://thelead.uk/group-trying-quietly-rebrand-conversion-therapy |access-date=30 October 2024 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=UKCP guidance regarding gender critical views |url= https://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/news/ukcp-guidance-regarding-gender-critical-views/ |access-date=30 October 2024 |website=www.psychotherapy.org.uk |archive-date=6 October 2024 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20241006163952/https://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/news/ukcp-guidance-regarding-gender-critical-views/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2024 the [[UK Council for Psychotherapy]] withdrew from the Memorandum and membership of the Coalition against Conversion Therapy on the grounds of not wanting to oppose conversion therapy for trans young people.&lt;ref name="Davison"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Davison |first1=Kate |last2=Hubbard |first2=Katherine |last3=Marks |first3=Sarah |last4=Spandler |first4=Hel |last5=Wynter |first5=Rebecca |date=7 October 2024 |title=An Inclusive History of LGBTQ+ Aversion Therapy: Past Harms and Future Address in a UK Context |journal=Review of General Psychology |doi=10.1177/10892680241289904 |issn=1089-2680|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Broughton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bodkin"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Bodkin |first=Henry |date=1 May 2024 |title=Psychotherapy body rows with trans activists over conversion therapy memo |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/05/01/uk-council-for-psychotherapy-row-conversion-therapy-cass/ |access-date=30 October 2024 |work=The Telegraph |location= London |archive-date=5 October 2024 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20241005211503/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/05/01/uk-council-for-psychotherapy-row-conversion-therapy-cass/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was criticized by other signatories of the MoU and over 1500 UKCP members.&lt;ref name="Bodkin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Broughton"/&gt; The board was retained as only 20% of voters called for their removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Members vote for the Board to remain in post |url=https://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/news/members-vote-for-the-board-to-remain-in-post/ |access-date=30 October 2024 |website=www.psychotherapy.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2020, the High Court issued a ruling banning transgender patients under the age of 16 from receiving [[Puberty blocker|puberty suppressing medication]] for the purpose of preventing the development of unwanted secondary sex characteristics. This led to many patients having their care withdrawn, and consequently having to undergo the puberty of their assigned gender at birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Andersson |first=Jasmine |date=8 December 2020 |title=Families of trans children 'broken' after sudden puberty blockers rule changes |url= https://inews.co.uk/news/health/puberty-blockers-ruling-change-transgender-families-reaction-gids-ngs-785232 |access-date=30 October 2024 |website=inews.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many more patients over the age of 16 also had their gender-related healthcare withdrawn, even if that care did not take the form of puberty blockers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Andersson |first=Jasmine |date=21 December 2020 |title=Treatment plans at gender clinics have 'effectively stopped' for young trans people, warns clinician |url= https://inews.co.uk/news/gids-tavistock-gender-hormone-treatment-clinician-trans-800657 |access-date=30 October 2024 |website=inews.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2024, the publication of the controversial Cass Review of youth gender services led to a criminal ban on puberty blockers, and a general shift in NHS policy towards [[gender exploratory therapy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Puberty blockers ban is lawful, says High Court |date=29 July 2024 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng3gz99nwo |access-date=31 October 2024 |work=BBC News |archive-date=1 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240801015039/https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng3gz99nwo |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Carnell |first=Henry |title=The UK's new study on gender affirming care misses the mark in so many ways |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/05/cass-review-transgender-health-care-nhs-gender-affirming-care/ |access-date=31 October 2024 |website=Mother Jones |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
In December 2021, the [[Girls' Day School Trust]], the largest network of girls' private schools in the UK, issued a blanket ban on trans girls being admitted to any of its schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=3 January 2022 |title=Leading group of private schools introduces 'unwise' ban on trans girls |url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2022/01/03/trans-girls-day-school-trust-gdst/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220125182753/https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2022/01/03/trans-girls-day-school-trust-gdst/ |archive-date=25 January 2022 |access-date=17 January 2022 |website=PinkNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2022, Attorney General [[Suella Braverman]] opined that it is lawful for schools to [[misgender]], [[deadname]], ban from some sports, reject from enrollment based on their trans status, and refuse any and all other forms of gender affirmation to trans kids, and that to recognise their identities as trans could qualify as "indoctrinating children".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Wakefield |first1=Lily |date=12 August 2022 |title=Suella Braverman 'misinterpreted' equality law in 'ideological' attack on trans kids, barrister says |url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2022/08/12/suella-bravermantrans-schools-speech-misinterpreted/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220812182351/https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2022/08/12/suella-bravermantrans-schools-speech-misinterpreted/ |archive-date=12 August 2022 |access-date=12 August 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sports ===
In September 2021, the UK Sports Council Equality Group issued new guidance saying that in their view, trans inclusion and "competitive fairness" cannot coexist in sports. The SCEG based its guidance on 300 interviews regarding personal opinions on the matter, conducted across 54 sports and 175 organisations, with only 20 of those interviewed being trans people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Powys Maurice |first1=Emma |date=October 2021 |title=Glaring holes emerge in new UK trans sports guidance as athletes fear for their future |url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/10/01/trans-sport-guidance-uk-backlash/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220730144941/https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/10/01/trans-sport-guidance-uk-backlash/ |archive-date=30 July 2022 |access-date=30 July 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2022, the then UK Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport [[Nadine Dorries]] met with the heads of UK sporting bodies and told them that "elite and competitive women's sport must be reserved for people born of the female sex".&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{Cite web |date=29 July 2022 |title=RFL and RFU ban transgender women from competing in female-only forms of their games |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/62349297.amp |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220730145011/https://www.bbc.com/sport/62349297.amp |archive-date=30 July 2022 |access-date=30 July 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, trans women have been banned from competing in [[women's sports]] in a wide array of disciplines, ranging from cycling to fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Billson |first=Chantelle |date=29 November 2023 |title=Trans women banned from England Ladies team angling |url=https://www.thepinknews.com/2023/11/29/trans-women-banned-angling-ladies-team/ |access-date=11 November 2024 |website=PinkNews {{!}} Latest lesbian, gay, bi and trans news {{!}} LGBTQ+ news |language=en-US |archive-date=30 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240930175302/https://www.thepinknews.com/2023/11/29/trans-women-banned-angling-ladies-team/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=British cycling federation bars transgender women from competing in female category |url=https://www.reuters.com/sports/cycling/british-federation-announces-tighter-rules-around-trans-non-binary-athletes-2023-05-26/ |work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International responses ==
In 2021 the [[Council of Europe]]'s Committee on Equality and Non-Discrimination warned that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
ongoing social, political and legal debate [in the United Kingdom (UK)] about what
constitutes harmful discourse when it comes to trans people and their rights, and
arguments defending freedom of expression have been – and are still being – used
as a tool to justify transphobic rhetoric, further penalising and harming already
marginalised trans people and communities
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and concluded the {{" '}}gender-critical' movement, which wrongly portrays trans rights as posing a particular threat to cisgender women and girls, has played a significant role in this process".&lt;ref name="Walters"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Walters |first=Mark Austin |year=2024 |title=Legalizing transphobia: from courtroom to legislature, how gender-critical activism is hurting us all |journal=Journal of Law and Society |language=en |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=343–366 |doi=10.1111/jols.12491 |issn=0263-323X|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=27 September 2021 |title=Combating rising hate against LGBTI people in Europe |url=https://assembly.coe.int/LifeRay/EGA/Pdf/TextesProvisoires/2021/20210921-RisingHateLGBTI-EN.pdf |website=Council of Europe Committee on Equality and Non-Discrimination |access-date=31 October 2024 |archive-date=23 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210923211038/https://assembly.coe.int/LifeRay/EGA/Pdf/TextesProvisoires/2021/20210921-RisingHateLGBTI-EN.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2023, a [[United Nations]] investigation found that the British [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] (EHRC) had deliberately acted with the objective of reducing [[human-rights]] protections for transgender people who had legal gender recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |title=UK: Keep calm and respect diversity, says UN expert |date=11 May 2023 |publisher=United Nations |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/05/1136567}}&lt;/ref&gt;
