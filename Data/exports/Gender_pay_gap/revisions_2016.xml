The [[European Commission]] defines the '''gender pay gap''' as the average difference between men's and women's aggregate hourly earnings. The wage gap is due to a variety of causes, such as differences in education choices, differences in preferred job and industry, differences in the types of positions held by men and women, differences in the type of jobs men typically go into as opposed to women (especially highly paid high risk jobs), differences in amount of work experience, difference in length of the work week, and breaks in employment. These factors resolve 60% to 75% of the pay gap, depending on the source. Various explanations for the remaining 25% to 40% have been suggested, including women's lower willingness and ability to negotiate salaries or else due to discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=An Analysis of Reasons for the Disparity in Wages Between Men and Women |url=http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |format=PDF |author=CONSAD Research Corporation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008051216/http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Patten, Eileen|work=Pew Research Center|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/14/on-equal-pay-day-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gender-pay-gap/|title=On Equal Pay Day, key facts about the gender pay gap|date=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Blau&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Francine D.

==Over time==
[[File:US womens earnings as a percentage of mens 1979-2005.gif|thumb|US women's weekly earnings as a percentage of men's by age, 1979–2005.]]

Looking at the gender pay gap over time, the [[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee]] showed that, as explained inequities decrease, the unexplained pay gap remains unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee]]. [http://jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=Earnings&amp;ContentRecord_id=db19df76-9299-4b46-a98c-ef33c21dab3d&amp;ContentType_id=2206321f-9e59-4f98-b972-d78c64abf642&amp;Group_id=51e071bd-07e9-46f2-bb70-cfc28baec8be ''Graph: Federal Workforce – Gender Pay Gap Unchanged''.] Retrieved on March 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, according to economists [[Francine D. Blau|Francine Blau]] and [[Lawrence Kahn]] and their research into the gender pay gap in the United States, a steady convergence between the wages of women and men is not automatic. They argue that after a considerable rise in women's wages during the 1980s, the gain decreased in the 1990s, which was due mainly to a much faster decline in the "unexplained" part of the gap during the 1980s than in the 1990s. They also contend that the slowing of this decline may have been caused by multiple factors, including "changes in labor force selectivity, changes in gender differences in unmeasured characteristics and in labor market discrimination, and changes in the favorableness of demand shifts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blau|first1=F. D.|last2=Kahn|first2=L. M.|title=The U.S. Gender Pay Gap in the 1990S: Slowing Convergence|journal=ILR Review|date=1 October 2006|volume=60|issue=1|pages=45–66|doi=10.1177/001979390606000103}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mixed picture of increase and decline characterizes the 2000s. Thus Blau and Kahn assume: &lt;blockquote&gt; With the evidence suggesting that convergence has slowed in recent years, the possibility arises that the narrowing of the gender pay gap will not continue into the future. Moreover, there is evidence that although discrimination against women in the labor market has declined, some discrimination does still continue to exist.&lt;ref name = Blau /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A wide ranging [[meta-analysis]] by Doris Weichselbaumer and Rudolf Winter-Ebmer (2005) of more than 260 published adjusted pay gap studies for over 60 countries has found that, from the 1960s to the 1990s, raw wage differentials worldwide have fallen substantially from around 65 to 30%. The bulk of this decline, however, was due to better labor market endowments of women. The 260 published estimates show that the unexplained component of the gap has not declined over time. Using their own specifications, Weichselbaumer and Winter-Ebmer found that the yearly overall decline of the gender pay gap would amount to a slow 0.17 log points, implying a slow level of convergence between the wages of men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weichselbaumer | first1 = Doris | last2 = Winter-Ebmer | first2 = Rudolf | year = 2005 | title = A Meta-Analysis on the International Gender Wage Gap | url = http://www.econ.jku.at/papers/2003/wp0311.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Economic Surveys | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 479–511 | doi = 10.1111/j.0950-0804.2005.00256.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another meta-analysis of 41 empirical studies on the wage gap performed in 1998 found a similar time trend in estimated pay gaps, a decrease of roughly 1% per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stanley|first1=T.

According to economist [[Alan Manning]] of the [[London School of Economics]], the process of closing the gender pay gap has slowed substantially and women could earn less than men for the next 150 years because of discrimination and ineffective government policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Manning | first1 = Alan | year = 2006 | title = The gender pay gap | url = http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/CP200.pdf| journal = CentrePiece | publisher = Centre for Economic Performance | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 13–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woolcock, Nicola.

According to the most recent analysis prepared for the United States Department of Labor:&lt;blockquote&gt;Although additional research in this area is clearly needed, this study leads to the unambiguous conclusion that the differences in the compensation of men and women are the result of a multitude of factors and that the raw wage gap should not be used as the basis to justify corrective action. Indeed, there may be nothing to correct. The differences in raw wages may be almost entirely the result of the individual choices being made by both male and female workers.&lt;ref name="consad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |title=An Analysis of Reasons for the Disparity in Wages Between Men and Women |date=12 January 2009 |publisher=CONSAD Research Corporation |format=PDF |access-date=8 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008051216/http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The differences in the opinion of a variety of different sources, economists and think tanks have led many to believe that corrective action may be necessary in the future if evidence is found that widespread discrimination is happening in the work place among every business, but until hard evidence is provided things ought to stay the same.

{{main article|Gender pay gap in Australia}}
In Australia, the gender pay gap is calculated on the average weekly ordinary time earnings for full-time employees published by the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]. The gender pay gap excludes part-time, casual earnings and overtime payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Department of Commerce (Western Australia)|Department of Commerce]]|url=http://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/labourrelations/Content/Work%20Life%20Balance/Pay%20Equity/FAQ_Pay_equity.html|title=Frequently asked questions about pay equity|accessdate=May 6, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422155711/http://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/LabourRelations/Content/Work%20Life%20Balance/Pay%20Equity/FAQ_Pay_equity.html|archivedate=April 22, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia has a persistent gender pay gap. Between 1990 and 2009, the gender pay gap remained within a narrow range of between 15 and 17%.&lt;ref name="natsem"&gt;{{citation|author=National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling|url=http://www.actu.org.au/Images/Dynamic/attachments/6895/NATSEM_report.pdf|title=The impact of a sustained gender wage gap on the economy|journal=Report to the Office for Women, Department of Families, Community Services, Housing and Indigenous Affairs|year=2009|pages=v–vi|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201110158/http://www.actu.org.au/Images/Dynamic/attachments/6895/NATSEM_report.pdf|archivedate=December 1, 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, the Australian gender pay gap was 16.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency|url=http://www.eowa.gov.au/Pay_Equity/Files/PE_STATS.pdf|title=Pay Equity Statistics|publisher=Australian Government|year=2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217234222/http://www.eowa.gov.au/Pay_Equity/Files/PE_STATS.pdf|archivedate=February 17, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ian Watson of [[Macquarie University]] examined the gender pay gap among full-time managers in Australia over the period 2001–2008, and found that between 65 and 90% of this earnings differential could not be explained by a large range of demographic and labor market variables. In fact, a "major part of the earnings gap is simply due to women managers being female." Watson also notes that despite the "characteristics of male and female managers being remarkably similar, their earnings are very different, suggesting that discrimination plays an important role in this outcome."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ian|last=Watson|year=2010|url=http://www.business.curtin.edu.au/files/295watson1.pdf|title=Decomposing the Gender Pay Gap in the Australian Managerial Labour Market|publisher=Macquarie University|journal=Australian Journal of Labour Economics|volume=13|number=1|pages=49–79|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306114914/http://www.business.curtin.edu.au/files/295watson1.pdf|archivedate=March 6, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 report to the [[Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs]] also found that "simply being a woman is the major contributing factor to the gap in Australia, accounting for 60 per cent of the difference between women's and men's earnings, a finding which reflects other Australian research in this area." The second most important factor in explaining the pay gap was industrial segregation.&lt;ref name="natsem" /&gt; A report by the World Bank also found that women in Australia who worked part-time jobs and were married came from households which had a gendered distribution of labor, possessed high job satisfaction, and hence were not motivated to increase their working hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/abs/10.1596/9780821388105_ch5|title=Gender Differences in Employment and Why They Matter|date=2011-09-12|publisher=The World Bank|isbn=9780821388105|series=World Development Report|pages=198–253|doi=10.1596/9780821388105_ch5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
A study of wages among Canadian [[Supply chain management|supply chain managers]] found that men make an average of $14,296 a year more than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larson|first1=Paul D.|last2=Morris|first2=Matthew|title=Sex and salary: Does size matter? (A survey of supply chain managers)|journal=Supply Chain Management: an International Journal|date=2014|volume=19|issue=4|pages=385–394|doi=10.1108/SCM-08-2013-0268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research suggests that as supply chain managers move up the corporate ladder, they are less likely to be female.

Each [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province and territory]] in Canada has a [[quasi-constitutional]] human rights code which prohibits discrimination based on sex. Several also have laws specifically prohibiting [[public sector]] and [[private sector]] employers from paying men and women differing amounts for substantially similar work. Verbatim, the Alberta Human Rights Act states in regards to equal pay, "Where employees of both sexes perform the same or substantially similar work for an employer in an establishment the employer shall pay the employees at the same rate of pay."&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Alberta Human Rights Act'', RSA 2000, c A-25.5 at §6 in [[Alberta]] and ''Pay Equity Act'', RSO 1990, c P.7 in [[Ontario]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
Using the gaps between men and women in economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment, ''The Global Gender Gap Report 2015'' ranks China's gender gap at 91 out of 145 countries (the lower the ranking, the narrower the gender gap), which is four rankings below 2014's global index. China's 2015 gender gap score was 0.681 (1.00 being equality). As an upper middle income country, as classified by the World Bank, China is the "third-least improved country in the world" on the gender gap. The health and survival subindex is the lowest within the countries listed; this subindex takes into account the gender differences of life expectancy and sex ratio at birth (the ratio of male to female children to depict the preferences of sons in accordance with China's One Child Policy).&lt;ref&gt;Schwab, Klaus, et al.

Accessed 29 Sept. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Jayoung Yoon claims the women's employment rate is decreasing. However, several of the contributing factors might be expected to increase women's participation. Yoon's contributing factors include: the traditional gender roles; the lack of childcare services provided by the state; the obstacle of childrearing; and the highly educated, unmarried women termed "leftover women" by the state. The term "leftover women" produces anxieties for women to rush marriage, delaying employment. In alignment with the traditional gender roles, the "Women Return to the Home" movement by the government encouraged women to leave their jobs to alleviate the men's unemployment rate.&lt;ref name=Yoon2015&gt;Yoon, Jayoung.

[[File:EU 27 Gender Pay Gap 2014.png|thumb|Gender gap in average gross hourly earnings according to [[Eurostat]] 2014.&lt;ref name="EC stats" /&gt;]]

At [[European Union|EU]] level, the gender pay gap is defined as the relative difference in the average gross hourly earnings of women and men within the economy as a whole. [[Eurostat]] found a persisting gender pay gap of 17.5% on average in the 27 [[Member state of the European Union|EU Member States]] in 2008. There were considerable differences between the Member States, with the pay gap ranging from less than 10% in Italy, Slovenia, Malta, Romania, Belgium, Portugal, and Poland to more than 20% in Slovakia, the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Germany, United Kingdom, and Greece and more than 25% in Estonia and Austria.&lt;ref name="EC stats"&gt;[[European Commission]].

A recent survey of international employment law firms showed that gender pay gap reporting is not a common policy internationally. Despite such laws on a national level being few and far between, there are calls for regulation on an EU level. A recent (as of December 2015) resolution of the European Parliament urged the Commission to table legislation closing the pay gap. A proposal that is substantively the same as the UK plan was passed by 344 votes to 156 in the European Parliament.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The European Commission has stated that the undervaluation of female work is one of the main contributors to the persisting gender pay gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Wo liegen die Ursachen? - Europäische Kommission|url = http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/gender-pay-gap/causes/index_de.htm|website = ec.europa.eu|access-date = 2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Germany ====
Women earned 22–23% less than men, according to the [[Federal Statistical Office of Germany]]. The revised gender pay gap was 6-8% in the years 2006–2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Pressemitteilungen - Gender Pay Gap 2013 bei Vollzeitbeschäftigten besonders hoch - Statistisches Bundesamt (Destatis)|url = https://www.destatis.de/DE/PresseService/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2014/03/PD14_104_621.html|website = Federal Statistical Office of German|access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft|Cologne Institute for Economic Research]] adjusted the wage gap to less than 2%. They reduced the gender pay gap from 25% to 11% by taking in account the work hours, education and the period of employment. The difference in revenue was reduced furthermore if women hadn't paused their job for more than 18 months due to motherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Beschäftigungsperspektiven von Frauen - Nur 2 Prozent Gehaltsunterschied|url = http://www.iwkoeln.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/beitrag/beschaeftigungsperspektiven-von-frauen-nur-2-prozent-gehaltsunterschied-102500|website = German Institute for Economic Research|access-date = 2016-02-18|language = de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Gender Pay Gap: Wie groß ist der Unterschied wirklich?|url = http://www.zeit.de/karriere/beruf/2013-03/lohnunterschied-geschlechter-statistik|newspaper = Die Zeit|access-date = 2016-02-18|issn = 0044-2070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant factors associated with the remaining gender pay gap are part-time work, education and occupational segregation (less women in leading positions and in fields like [[STEM]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Studie: Geschlecht senkt Gehalt um sieben Prozent|url = http://www.zeit.de/karriere/2013-03/gehalt-studie-frauen-maenner|newspaper = Die Zeit|access-date = 2016-02-18|issn = 0044-2070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====UK====
In the UK, the most significant factors associated with the remaining gender pay gap are part-time work, education, the size of the firm a person is employed in, and occupational segregation (women are under-represented in managerial and high-paying professional occupations).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first= Victoria |last= Thomson |date= October 2006 |title= How Much of the Remaining Gender Pay Gap is the Result of Discrimination, and How Much is Due to Individual Choices? |journal= International Journal of Urban Labour and Leisure |volume= 7 |issue= 2 |url= http://www.ijull.co.uk/vol7/2/thomson.pdf |accessdate= September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When comparing full-time roles, men in the UK tend to work longer hours than women in full-time employment.

In October 2014, the [[Equality Act 2010]] was augmented with regulations which require [[Employment Tribunal]]s to order an employer (except an existing [[Micro-enterprise|micro-business]] or a new business) to carry out an equal pay audit where the employer is found to have breached equal pay law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/2559/contents/made Equality Act 2010 (Equal Pay Audits) Regulations 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 study compiled by the Press Association based on data from the Office for National Statistics revealed that women in their 20s were out-earning men in their 20s by an average of £1,111, suggesting a reversal of trends. However, the same study showed that men in their 30s out-earned women in their 30s by an average of £8775. The study did not attempt to explain the causes of the gender gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/aug/29/women-in-20s-earn-more-men-same-age-study-finds|title=Women in their 20s earn more than men of same age, study finds|date=29 August 2015|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=April 2016}}

===Japan===
Jayoung Yoon analyzes Japan's culture of the traditional male breadwinner model, where the husband works outside of the house while the wife is the caretaker. Despite these traditional gender roles for women, Japan's government aims to enhance the economy by improving the labor policies for mothers with Abenomix (2013), an economy revitalization strategy. Yoon believes Abenomix represents a desire to remedy the effects of an aging population rather than a desire to promote gender equality. Evidence for the conclusion is the finding that women are entering the workforce in contingent positions for a secondary income and a company need of part-time workers based on mechanizing, outsourcing and subcontracting. Therefore, Yoon states that women's participation rates do not seem to be influenced by government policies but by companies' necessities.&lt;ref name=Yoon2015 /&gt; ''The Global Gender Gap Report 2015'' established that Japan's economic participation and opportunity ranking (106th), 145th being the broadest gender gap, dropped from 2014 "due to lower wage equality for similar work and fewer female legislators, senior officials and managers."&lt;ref name=Schwab2015pp25-27&gt;Schwab, Klaus, et al.

===Jordan===
From a total of 145 states, the World Economic Forum calculates Jordan's gender gap ranking for 2015 as 140th through economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment evaluations. Jordan is the "world's second-least improved country" for the overall gender gap.&lt;ref name=Schwab2015pp25-27 /&gt; The ranking dropped from 93rd in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Hausmann, Ricardo, Lauren D.

Accessed 29 Sept. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In contradiction to Jordan's provisions within its constitution and being signatory to multiple conventions for improving the gender pay gap, there is no legislation aimed at gender equality in the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Alfarhan, Usamah F. "Gender Earnings Discrimination in Jordan: Good Intentions Are Not Enough." ''International Labour Review'', vol. 154, no. 4, 2015, pp. 563-580.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Global Gender Gap Report 2015'', Jordan had a score of 0.61, 1.00 being equality, on pay equality for like jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Schwab, Klaus, et al.

===Singapore===
According to Jayoung Yoon, Singapore's aging population and low fertility rates are resulting in more women joining the labor force in response to the government's desire to improve the economy. The government provides tax relief to mothers in the workforce to encourage them to continue working. Yoon states that "as female employment increases, the gender gap in employment rates…narrows down" in Singapore.&lt;ref name=Yoon2015 /&gt; As a matter of fact, ''The Global Gender Gap Report 2015'' ranks Singapore's gender gap at 54th out of 145 states globally based on the economic participation and opportunity, the educational attainment, the health and survival, and the political empowerment subindexes (a lower rank means a smaller gender gap). The gender gap narrowed from 2014's ranking of 59. In the Asia and Pacific region, Singapore has evolved the most in the economic participation and opportunity subindex, yet it is lower than the region's means in educational attainment and political empowerment.&lt;ref name=Schwab2015pp25-27 /&gt;

===South Korea===
As stated by Jayoung Yoon, South Korea's female employment rate has increased since the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis as a result of women 25 to 34 years old leaving the workforce later to become pregnant and women 45 to 49 years old returning to the workforce. Mothers are more likely to continue working after child rearing on account of the availability of affordable childcare services provided for mothers previously in the workforce or the difficulty to be rehired after taking time off to raise their children.&lt;ref name=Yoon2015 /&gt; The World Economic Forum found that, in 2015, South Korea had a score of 0.55, 1.00 being equality, for pay equality for like jobs. From a total of 145 countries, South Korea had a gender gap ranking of 115th (the lower the ranking, the narrower the gender gap). On the other hand, political empowerment dropped to half of the percentage of women in the government in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Schwab, Klaus, et al. ''The Global Gender Gap Report 2015''. World Economic Forum, 2015, pp. 26, 228. http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GGGR2015/cover.pdf. Accessed 29 Sept. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|United States women|Equal Pay Act of 1963}}

In the United States, the gender pay gap is measured as the ratio of female to male median yearly earnings among full-time, year-round (FTYR) workers. The female-to-male earnings ratio was 0.77 in 2012, meaning that, in 2012, female FTYR workers earned 77% as much as male FTYR workers.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Census Bureau.

The raw wage gap data shows that a woman would earn roughly 73.7% to 77% of what a man would earn over their lifetime. However, when controllable variables are accounted for, such as job position, total hours worked, number of children, and the frequency at which unpaid leave is taken, in addition to other factors, a United States Department of Labor study, conducted by the CONSAD Research Group, found in 2008 that the gap can be brought down from 23% to between 4.8% and 7.1%.&lt;ref name="consad.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |title=An Analysis of Reasons for the Disparity in Wages Between Men and Women |publisher=Consad.com |accessdate=2014-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008051216/http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gender pay gap has been attributed to differences in personal and workplace characteristics between women and men (education, hours worked, occupation, etc.) as well as direct and indirect discrimination in the labor market (gender stereotypes, customer and employer bias etc.).&lt;ref name="Kanter2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kanter|first=Rosabeth Moss |title=Men and Women of the Corporation|date=4 August 2008|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-0-7867-2384-3|authorlink=Rosabeth Moss Kanter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="clinton4.nara.gov"&gt;[http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/EOP/CEA/html/gendergap.html#disc Office of the White House, Council of Economic Advisors, 1998, IV.

Other studies have found direct evidence of discrimination in recruitment.&lt;ref name="Correll" /&gt;

==Impact==

===Pensions===
The [[European Commission]] argues that the gender pay gap has far-reaching effects, especially in regard to pensions. Since women's earnings over a lifetime are on average 17.5% (as of 2008) lower than men's, these lower earnings result in lower pensions. As a result, elderly women are more likely to face poverty: 22% of women aged 65 and over are at risk of poverty compared to 16% of men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=European Commission|author-link=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/news/employment/110304_en.htm |title=Closing the gender pay gap|date=March 4, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306180420/http://ec.europa.eu/news/employment/110304_en.htm|archivedate=March 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy===
A 2009 report for the Australian [[Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs]] argued that in addition to fairness and equity there are also strong economic imperatives for addressing the gender wage gap.  The researchers estimated that a decrease in the gender wage gap from 17% to 16% would increase GDP per capita by approximately $260, mostly from an increase in the hours females would work. Ignoring opposing factors as hours females work increase, eliminating the whole gender wage gap from 17% could be worth around $93 billion or 8.5% of GDP. The researchers estimated the causes of the wage gap as follows, lack of work experience was 7%, lack of formal training was 5%, [[occupational segregation]] was 25%, working at smaller firms was 3%, and being female represented the remaining 60%.&lt;ref name="natsem"/&gt;

An October 2012 study by the [[American Association of University Women]] found that over the course of 47 years, an American woman with a college degree will make about $1.2 million less than a man with the same education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aauw.org/what-we-do/public-policy/aauw-issues/gender-pay-gap/|title=Women in their 20s earn more than men of same age, study finds|work=American Association of University Women}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, closing the pay gap by raising women's wages would have a stimulus effect that would grow the United States economy by at least 3% to 4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Christianne Corbett|author2=Catherine Hill|date=October 2012|url=http://www.aauw.org/files/2013/02/graduating-to-a-pay-gap-the-earnings-of-women-and-men-one-year-after-college-graduation.pdf|title=Graduating to a Pay Gap: The Earnings of Women and Men One Year after College Graduation|location=Washington, DC|publisher=American Association of University Women}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2016}}  By increasing women's workplace participation from its present rate of 76% to 84%, as it is in Sweden, the US could add 5.1 million women to the workforce, again, 3% to 4% of the size of the United States economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Laura|last=Bassett|date=October 24, 2012|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/24/gender-wage-gap-economic-stimulus_n_2007588.html|title=Closing The Gender Wage Gap Would Create 'Huge' Economic Stimulus, Economists Say|work=Huffington Post}}, citing [https://web.archive.org/web/20121114190344/http://www.aauw.org/GraduatetoaPayGap/upload/AAUWGraduatingtoaPayGapReport.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic theories==

===Neoclassical models===
In certain [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] models, discrimination by employers can be inefficient; excluding or limiting employment of a specific group will raise the wages of groups not facing discrimination. Other firms could then gain a competitive advantage by hiring more workers from the group facing discrimination. As a result, in [[Long run and short run|the long run]] discrimination would not occur. However, this view depends heavily on strong assumptions about the labor market and the [[production function]]s of the firms attempting to discriminate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Becker|first1=Gary|title=Nobel Lecture: The Economic Way of Looking at Behavior|journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]]|date=1993|volume=101|issue=3|pages=387–389|jstor=2138769|doi=10.1086/261880}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firms which discriminate on the basis of real or perceived customer or employee preferences would also not necessarily see discrimination disappear in the long run even under stylized models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cain|first1=Glen G.|editor1-last=Ashenfelter|editor1-first=Orley|editor2-last=Laynard|editor2-first=R.|title=Handbook of Labor Economics: Volume I|date=1986|isbn=9780444534521|pages=710–712|chapter=The Economic Analysis of Labor Market Discrimination: A Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monopsony explanation===
In [[monopsony]] theory, [[Monopsony#Wage discrimination|wage discrimination]] can be explained by variations in labor mobility constraints between workers. Ransom and Oaxaca (2005) show that women appear to be less pay sensitive than men, and therefore employers take advantage of this and discriminate in their pay for women workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://ftp.iza.org/dp704.pdf|title = Intrafirm Mobility and Sex Differences in Pay|last = Ransom|first = Michael|date = January 2005|journal = [[Industrial and Labor Relations Review]]|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |jstor = 30038574|last2 = Oaxaca|first2 = Ronald L.|author-link2 = Ronald Oaxaca|volume = 58|issue = 2|publisher = [[Sage Publications]]|issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of job choices==
In Canada, it is shown that women are more likely to seek employment opportunities which greatly contrast the ones of men. About 20 percent of women, between the ages of 25 and 54, will make just under $12 an hour in Canada. The demographic of women who take jobs paying less than $12 an hour is also a proportion that is twice as large as the proportion of men taking on the same type of [[McJob|low-wage work]]. There still remains the question of why such a trend seems to resonate throughout the developed world. One identified societal factor that has been identified is the influx of women of color and immigrants into the work force. These groups both tend to be subject to lower paying jobs from a statistical perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Congress, C. L. (n.d.). [http://classes.uleth.ca/200801/mgt3390a/womensequalityreportEn.pdf Women in the Workforce: Still a Long Way from Equality]. Retrieved November 23, 2012, from Canadian Labour Congress.&lt;/ref&gt; Men are more likely to be in relatively high-paying industries such as mining, construction, or manufacturing and to be represented by a union. Women, in contrast, are more likely to be in clerical jobs and to work in the service industry. These factors explain 53% of the wage gap.&lt;ref name = Blau /&gt;

==Effect of socialization==

Another social factor, which is related to the aforementioned one, is the socialization of individuals to adopt specific [[gender role]]s.&lt;ref name=Mooney&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mooney Marin|first1=Margaret|last2=Fan|first2=Pi-Ling|title=The Gender Gap in Earnings at Career Entry|journal=American Sociological Review|date=1997|volume=62|issue=4|pages=589–591|jstor=2657428|doi=10.2307/2657428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacobs|first1=Jerry|title=Revolving Doors: Sex Segregation and Women's Careers|date=1989|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|isbn=9780804714891}}&lt;/ref&gt; Job choices influenced by socialization are often slotted in to "demand-side" decisions in frameworks of wage discrimination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reskin|first1=Barbara|title=Sex Segregation in the Workplace|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|date=1993|volume=19|page=248|jstor=2083388|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.19.1.241}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than a result of extant labor market discrimination influencing job choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macpherson|first1=David A.|last2=Hirsch|first2=Barry T.|title=Wages and Gender Composition: Why do Women's Jobs Pay Less?|journal=Journal of Labor Economics|date=1995|volume=13|issue=3|page=460|jstor=2535151|doi=10.1086/298381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, in the eyes of employees, women in middle management are perceived to lack the courage, leadership, and drive that male managers appear to have, despite female middle managers achieving results on par with their male counterparts in terms of successful projects and achieving results for their employing companies.&lt;ref&gt;Martell, Richard F., et al.

==Anti-discrimination legislation==
According to the 2008 edition of the ''Employment Outlook'' report by the [[OECD]], almost all OECD countries have established laws to combat discrimination on grounds of gender. Examples of this are the Equal Pay Act of 1973 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Tharenou, Phyllis (2013). The Work of Feminists is Not Yet Done: The Gender Pay Gap—a Stubborn Anachronism&lt;/ref&gt; Legal prohibition of discriminatory behavior, however, can only be effective if it is enforced. The OECD points out that: &lt;blockquote&gt;"herein lies a major problem: in all OECD countries, enforcement essentially relies on the victims' willingness to assert their claims. But many people are not even aware of their legal rights regarding discrimination in the workplace. And even if they are, proving a discrimination claim is intrinsically difficult for the claimant and legal action in courts is a costly process, whose benefits down the road are often small and uncertain. All this discourages victims from lodging complaints."&lt;ref name="oecd1"&gt;[[OECD]]. [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/8/19/40937574.pdf ''OECD Employment Outlook – 2008 Edition Summary in English''.] OECD, Paris, 2008, p. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moreover, although many OECD countries have put in place specialized anti-discrimination agencies, only in a few of them are these agencies effectively empowered, in the absence of individual complaints, to investigate companies, take actions against employers suspected of operating discriminatory practices, and sanction them when they find evidence of discrimination.&lt;ref name="oecd1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oecd2"&gt;[[OECD]].

Chapter 3: The Price of Prejudice: Labour Market Discrimination on the Grounds of Gender and Ethnicity''.] OECD, Paris, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[Government Accountability Office|U.S. Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) found that women in the United States, on average, earned 80% of what men earned in 2000 and workplace discrimination may be one contributing factor. In light of these findings, GAO examined the enforcement of anti-discrimination laws in the private and public sectors. In a 2008 report, GAO focused on the enforcement and outreach efforts of the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) and the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] (Labor). GAO found that EEOC does not fully monitor gender pay enforcement efforts and that Labor does not monitor enforcement trends and performance outcomes regarding gender pay or other specific areas of discrimination. GAO came to the conclusion that "federal agencies should better monitor their performance in enforcing anti-discrimination laws."&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Government Accountability Office. [http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-08-799 ''Women's Earnings: Federal Agencies Should Better Monitor Their Performance in Enforcing Anti-Discrimination Laws''.] Retrieved on April 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Government Accountability Office. [http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08799.pdf Report ''Women's Earnings: Federal Agencies Should Better Monitor Their Performance in Enforcing Anti-Discrimination Laws''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the EEOC proposed a rule to submit more information on employee wages by gender to better monitor and combat gender discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;"Written Testimony of Jocelyn C. Frye Senior Fellow, Center for American Progress." 2016, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the famous "77%" number==
There have been criticisms of the common gender pay gap slogans in the United States, in particular regarding the estimate that the average woman's earnings are approximately equivalent to 77–78% of the average man's. Noted [[Equity feminism|Equity feminist]] [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] has repeatedly criticized the estimate, describing it as a "wage gap myth".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christina-hoff-sommers/wage-gap_b_2073804.html|title=Wage Gap Myth Exposed – By Feminists|date=November 4, 2012|accessdate=October 1, 2015|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|last=Sommers|first=Christina|authorlink=Christina Hoff Sommers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/01/no-women-don-t-make-less-money-than-men.html|title=No, Women Don't Make Less Money Than Men|date=February 1, 2014|accessdate=October 1, 2015|last=Sommers|first=Christina|authorlink=Christina Hoff Sommers|website=[[The Daily Beast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3222543/5-feminist-myths-that-will-not-die/|title=5 Feminist Myths That Will Not Die|date=September 2, 2014|accessdate=October 1, 2015|website=[[TIME]]|last=Sommers|first=Christina|authorlink=Christina Hoff Sommers}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sommers, "when you control for relevant differences between men and women (occupations, college majors, length of time in workplace) the wage gap narrows to the point of vanishing".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She argues that "[t]he 23-cent gender pay gap is simply the difference between the average earnings of all men and women working full-time", but that "[i]t does not account for differences in occupations, positions, education, job tenure, or hours worked per week" between men and women workers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When these factors are controlled, Sommers states that "the wage gap narrows to about five cents", but that "no one knows if the five cents is a result of discrimination or some other subtle, hard-to-measure difference between male and female workers".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Nevertheless, Sommers states that it is "demeaning" to women to imply "that they are manipulated into their life choices by forces beyond their control", which she considers "divorced from reality".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Hanna Rosin]] of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' argues that "the gender wage gap [that women make 77 cents to every man's dollar] is a lie", arguing that it is an inaccurate and "misleading statistic" which fails to grasp the complexity of the gender pay gap. In her article, she states that: "The point here is not that there is no wage inequality. But by focusing our outrage into a tidy, misleading statistic we've missed the actual challenges." According to Rosin, [i]t's the deeper, more systemic discrimination of inadequate family-leave policies and childcare options, of women defaulting to being the caretakers" that causes the gender pay gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2013/08/gender_pay_gap_the_familiar_line_that_women_make_77_cents_to_every_man_s.html|title=The Gender Wage Gap Lie|date=August 30, 2013|accessdate=October 1, 2015|website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|last=Rosin|first=Hanna|authorlink=Hanna Rosin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to President Obama's "persistent '77-cent' claim on the wage gap", [[Glenn Kessler (journalist)|Glenn Kessler]] gave it "Two Pinocchios" on the Fact Checker blog at ''[[The Washington Post]]''. Kessler states that while "[f]ew experts dispute that there is a wage gap", the "differences in the life choices of men and women—such as women tending to leave the workforce when they have children—make it difficult to make simple comparisons". In his opinion, he believes that President Obama "must begin to acknowledge that '77 cents' does not begin to capture what is actually happening in the work force and society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2014/04/09/president-obamas-persistent-77-cent-claim-on-the-wage-gap-gets-a-new-pinocchio-rating/|title=President Obama's persistent '77-cent' claim on the wage gap gets a new Pinocchio rating|date=April 9, 2014|accessdate=October 1, 2015|website=[[The Washington Post]]|last=Kessler|first=Glenn|authorlink=Glenn Kessler (journalist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
