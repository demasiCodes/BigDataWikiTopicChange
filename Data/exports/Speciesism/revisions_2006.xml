'''Speciesism''' involves assigning different values or rights to beings on the basis of their [[species]] membership. The term was coined by [[Richard D. Ryder]] in 1970 and is used to denote [[prejudice]] similar in kind to [[sexism]] and [[racism]]. 

The concept of speciesism is used mostly by advocates of [[animal rights]], who believe that it is [[Rationality|irrational]] or morally wrong.

Philosophers [[Tom Regan]] and [[Peter Singer]] have both criticized speciesism. Regan rejects it because it permits unjustified violations of animals' inherent [[rights]]; Singer, because it violates the principle of [[equal consideration of interests]].

==Great ape personhood==
[[Great Ape personhood]] is a related concept in which the attributes of the [[Great Ape]]s are deemed by some people, to merit recognition of their [[sentience]] and personhood within the [[law]], as opposed to mere protection under [[animal cruelty]] legislation. This would cover matters such as their own best interest being taken into account in their treatment by people.

==Religion==
Some religions are less speciesist than others. While [[animism|animists]] may believe in the equality of all [[Sentience|sentient]] beings, [[monotheism|monotheists]] tend to believe that human beings are superior to other lifeforms by [[God|divine]] intention. The teachings of [[Jainism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]] emphasize ideals such as ''sarva jeeva sama bhava'' (सर्व जीव सम भाव), that is, "all sentient beings are equal", and are examples of religions that tilt towards being less speciesist, though the extent to which this is reflected in daily life in countries where those religions are influential depends on the local culture. 

==Science fiction==
Speciesism is a popular theme in [[science fiction]], referring to a prejudice against other intelligent species, equivalent to [[racism]]. For example, during the reign of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] in ''[[Star Wars]]'', many [[extraterrestrial|alien]] species were oppressed by the ruling government, which consisted mainly of humans. In this context, it is sometimes referred to as [[xenophobia]].
