In practice the term is used to refer to discrimination against non-human animals by [[Homo sapiens|human beings]] - that is, to [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] speciesism. Speciesism is condemned by proponents of what is generally known as [[animal rights]] including philosophers such as Tom Regan and [[Peter Singer]]. The former rejects it as allowing for unjustified violations of animals' inherent rights; the latter, as being against the principle of equal consideration of interests.

Generally speaking, Asian cultures influnced by [[Jainism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]] have been somewhat less speciesist than Western ones, possibly because a belief in [[reincarnation]] effaces moral distinctions between those currently incarnated as humans and those currently incarnated as animals.
