'''Victimisation''' is an [[employment law]] concept. It refers to situations where people are targeted with abuse, suffer detriment to their employment conditions or are dismissed as a result of bringing a claim for another form of discrimination. If an employee is "victimised" for complaining about another part of work, then a separate and independent claim for such treatment would arise.
If an employee has brought a discrimination claim, acted as a witness in someone else's claim or raised issues relating to potential discrimination, any action taken against them because of this will be unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= This section provides general information on employment law in the UK|publisher=UK Film Council|last=|first=|year=2009|url= http://www.diversitytoolkit.org.uk/workinginfilm/employmentlaw/discriminationlaw/harassment/|accessdate=2009-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
