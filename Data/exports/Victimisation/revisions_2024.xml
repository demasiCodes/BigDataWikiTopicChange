'''Victimisation''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C -ize .28-isation.2C -ization.29|or]] '''victimization''') is the state or process of being victimised or becoming a [[wikt:victim|victim]]. The field that studies the process, rates, incidence, effects, and prevalence of victimisation is called [[victimology]].

==Peer victimisation==
{{Main|Peer victimisation}}
Peer victimisation is the experience among children of being a target of the [[aggressive]] behaviour of other children, who are not siblings and not necessarily age-mates.&lt;ref name=twenty&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hawker D.S.J. |author2=Boulton M.J. | year = 2000 | title = Twenty years' research on peer victimisation and psychosocial maladjustment: a meta-analytic review of cross-sectional studies | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 41 | issue = 4| pages = 441–455 | doi=10.1111/1469-7610.00629|pmid=10836674 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peer victimisation is correlated with an increased risk of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and decreased [[well-being]] in adulthood. &lt;ref name="b621"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Armitage | first=Jessica M. | last2=Wang | first2=R.

==Revictimisation==
The term '''revictimisation''' refers to a pattern wherein the victim of abuse and/or crime has a statistically higher tendency to be victimised again, either shortly thereafter&lt;ref name="Finkelhor-2007"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Finkelhor | first1 = D. | last2 = Ormrod | first2 = RK. | last3 = Turner | first3 = HA. | title = Re-victimization patterns in a national longitudinal sample of children and youth | journal = Child Abuse Negl | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 479–502 |date=May 2007 | doi = 10.1016/j.chiabu.2006.03.012 | pmid = 17537508 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.361.3226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or much later in adulthood in the case of abuse as a child.  This latter pattern is particularly notable in cases of sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=rad&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sexual Assault Revictimization |journal=Research &amp; Advocacy Digest |volume=6 |issue=2 |date=May 2004 |pages=1 |first=Janet|last=Anderson|publisher=The Washington Coalition of Sexual Assault Programs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=messman&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0272-7358(96)00019-0|title=Child Sexual Abuse and its Relationship to Revictimization in Adult Women|author1=Messman Terri L. |author2=Long Patricia J. |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=397–420|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; While an exact percentage is almost impossible to obtain, samples from many studies suggest the rate of revictimisation for people with histories of sexual abuse is very high.  The vulnerability to victimisation experienced as an adult is also not limited to sexual assault, and may include [[Domestic violence|physical abuse]] as well.&lt;ref name=rad/&gt;

Reasons as to why revictimisation occurs vary by event type, and some mechanisms are unknown.  Revictimisation in the short term is often the result of risk factors that were already present, which were not changed or mitigated after the first victimisation; sometimes the victim cannot control these factors.  Examples of these risk factors include living or working in dangerous areas, chaotic familial relations, having an aggressive temperament, drug or alcohol usage and unemployment.&lt;ref name=rad/&gt; Revictimisation may be "facilitated, tolerated, and even produced by particular institutional contexts, illustrating how the risk of revictimization is not a characteristic of the individual, nor is it destiny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bjørnholt |first1=M |year=2019 |title=The social dynamics of revictimization and intimate partner violence: an embodied, gendered, institutional and life course perspective |journal=[[Nordic Journal of Criminology]] |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=90–110|doi=10.1080/14043858.2019.1568103 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revictimisation of adults who were previously sexually abused as children is more complex.  Multiple theories exist as to how this functions.  Some scientists propose a maladaptive form of [[Learning theory (education)|learning]]; the initial abuse teaches inappropriate beliefs and behaviours that persist into adulthood.  The victim believes that abusive behaviour is "normal" and comes to expect, or feel they deserve it from others in the context of relationships, and thus may unconsciously seek out abusive partners or cling to abusive relationships.  Another theory draws on the principle of [[learned helplessness]].  As children, they are put in situations that they have little to no hope of escaping, especially when the abuse comes from a caregiver.&lt;ref name=messman/&gt; One theory goes that this state of being unable to [[Fight-or-flight response|fight back or flee]] the danger leaves the last primitive option:  freeze, an offshoot of [[Apparent death|death-feigning]].

Revictimization has also been characterized as a phenomenon whereby the children depicted in child pornography have a feeling of the depicted event reoccurring every single time the image is viewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.victimsfirst.gc.ca/pdf/childp-pjuvenile.pdf | title=Every Image, Every child – INTERNET-FACILITATED CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE IN CANADA | access-date=2023-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each time the image is viewed, the children relive the experience as if it were happening all over again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.dailyherald.com/article/20120116/news/701169906/ | title=Should Navy vet get prison for 'staggering' child porn collection? | date=16 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://fox8.com/news/former-pastor-sentenced-to-prison-on-child-porn-charges/ |first1=Dave |last1=Nethers |website=Fox 8 | title=Former Pastor Sentenced to Prison on Child Porn Charges | date=21 May 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230108001751/https://fox8.com/news/former-pastor-sentenced-to-prison-on-child-porn-charges/ |archive-date= 8 January 2023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the images are viewed over and over again,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-108shrg93014/html/CHRG-108shrg93014.htm | title= Pornography on the Internet |date=2003 |publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221017235306/https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-108shrg93014/html/CHRG-108shrg93014.htm |archive-date= 17 October 2022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this leaves the children feeling, or being as if they were, raped all over again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Gale |first=Sara |date=29 May 2016 |title=5 Gruesome Facts About Child Pornography: Why Some People Are Addicted To It |url=https://www.counselheal.com/articles/24956/20160529/5-gruesome-facts-child-pornography-why-people-addicted.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210830051736/http://www.counselheal.com/articles/24956/20160529/5-gruesome-facts-child-pornography-why-people-addicted.htm |archive-date=30 August 2021 |website=Counsel &amp; Heal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Obada-Obieh |first=Borke |last2=Huang |first2=Yue |last3=Spagnolo |first3=Lucrezia |last4=Beznosov |first4=Konstantin |title=SoK: The Dual Nature of Technology in Sexual Abuse |url=https://oaklandsok.github.io/papers/obadaobieh2022.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230108001742/https://oaklandsok.github.io/papers/obadaobieh2022.pdf |archive-date=8 January 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://sentencing.typepad.com/files/us-v-cr-eeinstein-sentencing_memorandum-final.pdf | title=UNITED STATES OF AMERICA MEMORANDUM AND ORDER – against – JACK B.

== Offenders choosing pre-traumatized victims ==

In adulthood, the [[freeze response]] can remain, and some professionals have noted that victimisers sometimes seem to pick up subtle clues of this when choosing a victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wheeler S. |author2=Book A.S. |author3=Costello K. | year = 2009 | title = Psychopathic traits and perceptions of victim vulnerability | journal = Criminal Justice and Behavior | volume = 36 | issue = 6| pages = 635–648 | doi=10.1177/0093854809333958|s2cid=143856019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This behaviour can make the victim an easier target, as they sometimes make less effort to fight back or vocalise. Afterwards, they often [[make excuses]] and [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimise]] what happened to them, sometimes never reporting the assault to the authorities.

==Self-victimisation==
{{Main|Victim playing}}
Self-victimisation (or victim playing) is the fabrication of victimhood for a variety of reasons, such as to justify real or perceived abuse of others, to manipulate others, as a [[coping strategy]], or for [[attention seeking]]. In a political context, self-victimisation could also be seen as an important political tool within post-conflict, nation-building societies. While failing to produce any affirmative values, the fetishistic lack of future is masked up by an excess of confirmation of its own status of victimhood, as noted by the Bosnian political theoretician Jasmin Hasanović, seeing it in the post-[[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] context as a form of [[Colonial mentality|auto-colonialism]], where reproducing the narrative of victimhood corresponds with the balkanization stereotypes, being the very narrative of the colonizer where the permanence of war is the contemporaneity of fear, affirming the theses on eternal hatred thus strengthening [[ethnonationalism]] even more.&lt;ref&gt;Hasanović J. (2021). Mirroring Europeanization: Balkanization and Auto-Colonial Narrative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Berlin: De Gruyter, pp 93 https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110684216-004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-image of victimisation (victim mentality)==
{{Main|Victim mentality}}
Victims of [[abuse]] and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] sometimes get trapped into a [[self-image]] of victimisation. The psychological profile of victimisation includes a pervasive sense of helplessness, passivity, loss of control, [[pessimism]], negative thinking, strong feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[shame]], [[Blame#Self-blame|self-blame]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. This way of thinking can lead to hopelessness and despair.&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;Braiker, Harriet B., Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victimisation in Kazakhstan==
At the end of 2012, a first-ever victimisation survey of 219,500 households (356,000 respondents) was conducted by the State Statistics Agency at the request of [[Marat Tazhin]], the head of the Security Council and a sociologist by training. According to the survey, 3.5% of respondents reported being a victim of crime in the previous 12 months, and only half of those said that they had reported the crime to the police. The presidential administration chose not to release any further details from this survey to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Slade|first1=Gavin|last2=Trochev|first2=Alexei|last3=Talgatova|first3=Malika|date=2020-12-02|title=The Limits of Authoritarian Modernisation: Zero Tolerance Policing in Kazakhstan|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/09668136.2020.1844867|journal=Europe-Asia Studies|volume=73|pages=178–199|doi=10.1080/09668136.2020.1844867|s2cid=229420067|issn=0966-8136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May–June 2018, the first [[International Crime Victims Survey]] (ICVS) of nationally representative sample of 4,000 persons was conducted in [[Kazakhstan]]. It showed low levels of victimisation. The overall violent crime victimization rate among the population in a one-year period was 3.7%. Rates of violent victimization by strangers were somewhat higher among females (2.1%) than among males (1.8%). The rates of violence by persons known to them were as much as three times higher for women than for men (2.8% for females and 0.8% for males).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|last=van Dijk|first=Jan|date=2018|title=Criminal Victimization in Kazakhstan|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340004372}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a one-year period, the highest rates of victimisation were consumer fraud (13.5% of respondents), theft from the car and personal theft (6.3% of respondents), and official bribe-seeking (5.2% of respondents). In almost half of bribe-seeking cases the bribe-seeker was a [[police officer]]. Taking only the [[Demographics of Kazakhstan|adult population of Kazakhstan]] into account, the ICVS police bribery figures suggest around 400,000 incidents of police bribery every year in Kazakhstan. These calculations are most likely very conservative in that they only capture when a bribe has been solicited and exclude instances of citizen-initiated bribery. The ICVS revealed extremely low levels of reporting crime to the police.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Only one in five crimes were reported to the police in Kazakhstan,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; down from the 46% reporting rate recorded in the government-conducted 2012 survey.

==Rates of victimisation in United States==
Levels of criminal activity are measured through three major data sources: the [[Uniform Crime Reports]] (UCR), self-report surveys of criminal offenders, and the [[National Crime Victimization Survey]] (NCVS). However, the UCR and self-report surveys generally report details regarding the offender and the criminal offense; information on the victim is only included so far as his/her relationship to the offender, and perhaps a superficial overview of his/her injuries. The NCVS is a tool used to measure the existence of actual, rather than only those reported, crimes—the victimisation rate&lt;ref name="NCVS"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/cvict.htm |title=National Crime Victimization Survey Official web site |access-date=24 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223163046/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/cvict.htm |archive-date=23 February 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;—by asking individuals about incidents in which they may have been victimised. The National Crime Victimization Survey is the [[United States]]' primary source of information on crime victimisation.

Each year, data is obtained from a nationally represented sample of 77,200 households comprising nearly 134,000 persons on the frequency, characteristics and consequences of criminal victimisation in the United States.  This survey enables the (government) to estimate the likelihood of victimisation by [[rape]] (more valid estimates were calculated after the surveys redesign in 1992 that better tapped instances of sexual assault, particularly of [[date rape]]),&lt;ref name=Doerner&gt;{{cite book|last=Doerner|first=William|title=Victimology|year=2012|publisher=Elseiver, Inc.|location=Burlington, MA|isbn=978-1-4377-3486-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[robbery]], [[assault]], [[theft]], household burglary, and motor vehicle theft for the population as a whole as well as for segments of the population such as women, the elderly, members of various racial groups, city dwellers, or other groups.&lt;ref name="NCVS" /&gt; According to the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] (BJS), the NCVS reveals that, from 1994 to 2005, violent crime rates have declined, reaching the lowest levels ever recorded.&lt;ref name="NCVS" /&gt; Property crimes continue to decline.&lt;ref name="NCVS" /&gt;

In 2010, the [[National Institute of Justice]] reported that American adolescents were the age group most likely to be victims of violent crime, while American men were more likely than American women to be victims of violent crime, and blacks were more likely than Americans of other races to be victims of violent crime. With Black men being the most often victims of violent crime.&lt;ref name="NIJ2010"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nij.gov/topics/victims-victimization/welcome.htm | title=Victims and Victimization | date=20 September 2010 | access-date=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
