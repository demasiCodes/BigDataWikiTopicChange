'''Diversity, equity, and inclusion''' ('''DEI''') are organizational frameworks which seek to promote the fair treatment and full participation of all people, particularly groups who have historically been underrepresented or subject to [[discrimination]] on the basis of [[identity (social science)|identity]] or [[disability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title='DEI' – on Dictionary.com |url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/dei |access-date=2023-03-25 |website=dictionary.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three notions ([[diversity (politics)|diversity]], [[social equity|equity]], and [[social exclusion#Social inclusion|inclusion]]) together represent "three closely linked values" which organizations seek to institutionalize through DEI frameworks.&lt;ref name="mckinsey"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is diversity, equity, and inclusion? |url=https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-diversity-equity-and-inclusion |publisher=McKinsey &amp; Company |access-date=25 March 2023 |date=17 August 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts predate this terminology and other variations sometimes include terms such as '''belonging''', '''justice''', and '''accessibility'''.

''Diversity'' refers to the presence of variety within the organizational workforce, such as in [[identity (social science)|identity]] and [[identity politics]].

DEI is most often used to describe certain training efforts, such as [[diversity training]]. Although DEI is best known as a form of [[corporate]] training, it also finds implementation within many types of organizations, such as within [[academia]], [[school]]s, and hospitals.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Grubbs |first=Vanessa |date=2020-07-23 |title=Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion That Matter |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=383 |issue=4 |page=e25 |doi=10.1056/NEJMpv2022639 |pmid=32649073 |s2cid=220465926 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenkranz |first1=Kari M. |last2=Arora |first2=Tania K. |last3=Termuhlen |first3=Paula M. |last4=Stain |first4=Steven C. |last5=Misra |first5=Subhasis |last6=Dent |first6=Daniel |last7=Nfonsam |first7=Valentine |title=Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Medicine: Why It Matters and How do We Achieve It? |journal=Journal of Surgical Education |date=July 2021 |volume=78 |issue=4 |pages=1058–1065 |doi=10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.11.013 |pmid=33279427 |s2cid=227521028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Into the 2020s, DEI efforts and policies have generated criticism, some directed at the specific effectiveness of its tools, such as diversity training, and its effect on free speech and academic freedom, as well as more broadly attracting criticism on political or philosophical grounds.

==History in the United States==
DEI policy emerged from [[Affirmative action in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;See the concluding chapter, "Demise of Affirmative Action in the Age of Diversity," in Terry H. Anderson, ''The Pursuit of Fairness: A History of Affirmative Action'' (2004) pp. 217–273. &lt;/ref&gt; The legal term "affirmative action" was first used in "[[Executive Order 10925|Executive Order No. 10925]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://shfg.org/resources/Documents/FH%202%20(2010)%20MacLaury.pdf | title=President Kennedy's E.O.10925: Seedbed of Affirmative Action | publisher=Society for History in the Federal Government | access-date=20 August 2020 | archive-date=27 October 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201027201202/http://shfg.org/resources/Documents/FH%202%20%282010%29%20MacLaury.pdf | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; signed by President [[Presidency of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]] on 6 March 1961, which included a provision that [[government contractor]]s "take ''affirmative action'' to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated [fairly] during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin".&lt;ref name="oeod.uci.edu"&gt;[http://www.oeod.uci.edu/aa.html A Brief History of Affirmative Action] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512084109/http://www.oeod.uci.edu/aa.html|date=12 May 2015}}, University of California, Irvine (access date 16 May 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; It was used to promote actions that achieve non-discrimination. In September 1965, President [[Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]] issued [[Executive Order 11246]] which required government employers to "hire without regard to race, religion and national origin" and "take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, color, religion, sex or national origin."&lt;ref&gt;Executive Order 11246&lt;/ref&gt; The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. Neither executive order nor The Civil Rights Act authorized group preferences. The Senate floor manager of the bill, Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]], declared that the bill “would prohibit preferential treatment for any particular group” adding  “I will eat my hat if this leads to racial quotas.”
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ifamnews.com/en/it-is-time-for-senator-humphrey-to-eat-his-hat | title= Today's racial quotas? Senator Humphrey would've eaten his hat | publisher=Family News Network | date=January 20, 2022 | access-date=17 July 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; However affirmative action in practice would eventually become synonymous with preferences, goals and quotas as upheld or struck down by Supreme Court decisions even though no law had been passed explicitly permitting discrimination in favor of disadvantaged groups. Some state laws explicitly banned racial preferences, and in response some laws have failed attempting to explicitly legalize race preferences.

Affirmative action is intended to alleviate under-representation and to promote the opportunities of defined minority groups within a society to give them [[Accessibility|equal access]] to that of the majority population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Affirmative Action |url=http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/sharamkohan1/affirmative-action/ |website=Harvard Blogs |publisher=Harvard Law School |access-date=30 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518061955/http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/sharamkohan1/affirmative-action/ |archive-date=18 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophical basis of the policy has various rationales, including but not limited to compensation for past discrimination, correction of current discrimination, and the diversification of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tierney |first=William G. |date=1997 |title=The Parameters of Affirmative Action: Equity and Excellence in the Academy |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1170625 |journal=Review of Educational Research |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=165–196 |doi=10.3102/00346543067002165 |jstor=1170625 |issn=0034-6543}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often implemented in governmental and educational settings to ensure that designated groups within a society can participate in all promotional, educational, and training opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equal Opportunity &amp; Affirmative Action Policy Statement|url=http://www.chatham.edu/about/legal_nondiscrimination.cfm|website=chatham.edu|access-date=30 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501102235/http://www.chatham.edu/about/legal_nondiscrimination.cfm|archive-date=1 May 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stated justification for affirmative action by its proponents is to help compensate for past discrimination, persecution or [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] by the ruling class of a culture,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Sowell, Thomas (2004). ''Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study'', Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0-300-10199-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to address existing discrimination.&lt;ref name="Affirmative Action"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/affirmative-action/|title=Affirmative Action|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date= 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently concepts have moved beyond discrimination to include diversity, equity and inclusion as motives for preferring historically underrepresented groups. In the famous ''Bakke decision'' of 1978, ''[[Regents of the University of California v. Bakke]]'', diversity now became a factor in constitutional law. The Supreme Court ruled quotas were illegal but it was allowable to consider race as a plus factor when trying to foster "diversity" in their classes.&lt;ref&gt;Steven M.  Gillon, "The strange career of affirmative action: the Civil Rights Act of 1964" in his '' "That's Not What We Meant to Do": Reform and Its Unintended Consequences in Twentieth-Century America'' (WW Norton, 2000) p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Court ruled: “The diversity that furthers a compelling state interest encompasses a far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element," quoted in Brent K., Nakamura, and Lauren B. Edelman, "Bakke at 40: How diversity matters in the employment context." ''UC Davis Law Review'' 52 (2018): 2627–2679 at p. 2629. [https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk15026/files/media/documents/52-5_Nakamura_Edelman.pdf online] &lt;/ref&gt;

Diversity themes gained momentum in the mid-1980s. At a time when President [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Ronald Reagan]] threatened to dismantle equality and affirmative action laws in the 1980s, equality and affirmative action professionals employed by US firms along with equality consultants, engaged in establishing the argument that a diverse workforce should be seen as a competitive advantage rather than just as a legal constraint. Basically, their message was, do not promote diversity because it is a legal mandate, but because it is good for business. From then on, researchers started to test a number of hypotheses on the business benefits of diversity and of diversity management, known as the business case of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Erin Kelly, and Frank Dobbin, "How affirmative action became diversity management: Employer response to antidiscrimination law, 1961 to 1996." ''American Behavioral Scientist'' 41.7 (1998): 960–984. [https://www.academia.edu/download/50621481/How_Affirmative_Action_Became_Diversity_20161129-7922-1rnmddm.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, corporations spent $8 billion annually on diversity. In 2011 [[Barack Obama]] signed [[s:Executive Order 13583|Executive Order 13583]] concerning Diversity and inclusion.&lt;ref name="c811"/&gt; After the [[First presidency of Donald Trump|election of Donald Trump]] in 2016 and the ascent of the [[MeToo movement|#MeToo]] and [[Black Lives Matter]] movements, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine stated in 2019 that the DEI industry had "exploded" in size.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Newkirk |first1=Pamela |title=Diversity Has Become a Booming Business.

One 2020 estimate placed the size of the global diversity and inclusion market at $7.5 billion, of which $3.4 billion was in the United States, projecting it to reach $17.2 billion by 2027.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Global Diversity and Inclusion (D&amp;I) Industry |url=https://www.reportlinker.com/p06219616/Global-Diversity-and-Inclusion-D-I-Industry.html |access-date=26 March 2023 |publisher=Global Industry Analysts |date=October 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2021, [[Joe Biden]] signed several [[executive order]]s concerning DEI, including [[Executive Order 13985]] and [[s:Executive Order 14035|Executive Order 14035]].&lt;ref name="c811"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sweeting | first=Karen D. | title=Executive Orders: Mandating Inclusion in the Federal Workplace: Insights from Federal Executive Departments' Strategic Plans | journal=Public Personnel Management | volume=52 | issue=4 | date=2023 | issn=0091-0260 | doi=10.1177/00910260231187542 | pages=590–623}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2021, [[New York (magazine)|''New York'']] magazine stated "the business became astronomically larger than ever" after the [[murder of George Floyd]] in May 2020.&lt;ref&gt;Bridget Read, "Reckoning with as Reckoning: Doing the Work at Work What are companies desperate for diversity consultants actually buying?" ''New York: The Cut'',  May 26, 2021 [https://www.thecut.com/article/diversity-equity-inclusion-industrial-companies.html online].&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' has also stated that surveys of international companies indicate that the number of people hired for jobs with "diversity" or "inclusion" in the title more than quadrupled since 2010.&lt;ref name="econ"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Workplace diversity programmes often fail, or backfire |url=https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/08/25/workplace-diversity-programmes-often-fail-or-backfire |access-date=26 March 2023 |magazine=The Economist |date=25 August 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2024, affirmative action rhetoric has been increasingly replaced by emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion, while nine states explicitly ban its use in the employment process.&lt;ref&gt;Nino Monea, "Next on the Chopping Block: The Litigation Campaign against Race-Conscious Policies Beyond Affirmative Action in University Admissions."

The Court held that affirmative action programs "lack sufficiently focused and measurable objectives warranting the use of race, unavoidably employ race in a negative manner, involve racial stereotyping, and lack meaningful end points.

==Methods and arguments==

In a 2018 article, proponents of DEI argued that because businesses and corporations exist within a larger world, they cannot be completely separated from the issues that exist in society. Therefore, the authors argue the need for DEI to improve coworker relations and teamwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Gill |first1=Gurwinder Kaur |last2=McNally |first2=Mary Jane |last3=Berman |first3=Vin |date=2018-08-16 |title=Effective diversity, equity, and inclusion practices |journal=Healthcare Management Forum |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=196–199 |doi=10.1177/0840470418773785 |pmid=30114938 |s2cid=52019098 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through a DEI plan, organizations outline measures to be taken, including recruiting and retaining personnel, fostering effective communication channels, imparting relevant training, and regulating workplace conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Noah |date=2023-01-07 |title=Equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) in the workplace |url=https://diversityandinclusive.com/equality-diversity-and-inclusion-edi-in-the-workplace/ |access-date=2023-03-08 |website=Diversity And Inclusion |language=en-US |archive-date=2023-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230308183212/https://diversityandinclusive.com/equality-diversity-and-inclusion-edi-in-the-workplace/ |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2022, many academic institutions in the US have also started making commitments to DEI in different ways, including creating documents, programs and appointing dedicated staff members especially in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=University |first=Carnegie Mellon |title=Homepage – Diversity, Equity and Inclusion – Carnegie Mellon University |url=http://www.cmu.edu/diversity/index.html |access-date=2022-03-21 |website=www.cmu.edu |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Diversity, Equity and Inclusion – University of Houston |url=https://uh.edu/diversity-equity-inclusion/ |access-date=2022-03-21 |website=uh.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many accreditation agencies now require supporting DEI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Bohanon |first=Mariah |date=2022-03-16 |title=DEI in Accreditation |url=https://www.insightintodiversity.com/dei-in-accreditation/ |access-date=2022-10-01 |website=Insight Into Diversity |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Diversity and Inclusion in the Standards {{!}} AACSB |url=https://www.aacsb.edu/educators/accreditation/business-accreditation/diversity |access-date=2022-10-01 |website=www.aacsb.edu |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As of 2014, information on DEI for both students and professors was widespread in colleges and universities, with many schools requiring training and meetings on the topic. Many scholarships and opportunities at universities even have a secondary purpose of encouraging diversity. Diversity in higher education can be difficult, with diverse students often feeling reduced to fulfilling a 'diversity quota,' which can carry a high emotional tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harris-Hasan |first1=Alandra |title=What Is Really Going On: Black Graduate Students in Higher Education |journal=Diverse Issues in Higher Education |volume=31 |issue=18 |date=9 October 2014 |page=58 |url=https://www.diverseeducation.com/students/article/15095499/what-is-really-going-on-black-graduate-students-in-higher-ed }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diversity management as a concept appeared and gained momentum in the US in the mid-1980s. At a time when President Ronald Reagan threatened to dismantle equality and affirmative action laws in the US in the 1980s, equality and affirmative action professionals employed by US firms along with equality consultants, engaged in establishing the argument that a diverse workforce should be seen as a competitive advantage rather than just as a legal constraint. Basically, their message was, do not promote diversity because it is a legal mandate, but because it is good for business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kelly |first1=Erin |last2=Dobbin |first2=Frank |title=How Affirmative Action Became Diversity Management: Employer Response to Antidiscrimination Law, 1961 to 1996 |journal=American Behavioral Scientist |date=April 1998 |volume=41 |issue=7 |pages=960–984 |doi=10.1177/0002764298041007008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the murder of George Floyd in 2020, some companies made substantial commitments to racial equity by establishing dedicated diversity, equity, and inclusion teams.&lt;ref name="Telford2024"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Telford |first1=Taylor |title=As DEI gets more divisive, companies are ditching their teams |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/02/20/corporate-diversity-job-cuts/?wpisrc=nl_most&amp;carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F3cca38a%2F65d22e824747fb47ca6caf05%2F596b40329bbc0f403f8de828%2F10%2F43%2F65d22e824747fb47ca6caf05 |newspaper=Washington Post |date=18 February 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2024, the ''Washington Post'' reported that there is a trend in corporate America to reduce DEI positions and delegate the work to external consultants.&lt;ref name="Telford2024" /&gt; The number of DEI jobs reached its highest point in early 2023, but subsequently decreased by 5 percent that year and has further shrunk by 8 percent in 2024.

==Political and public reaction==

===Higher education===
Since 2023, Republican-dominated state legislatures are considering bills that are against DEI efforts, primarily at state colleges and universities.  The downgrading is taking place amid heavy legal pressures.  Supreme Court in June 2023 upended established equal protection law with its decision in [[Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard]]. This ruling, effectively eliminated the use of affirmative action in college admissions but did not directly affect employers. Nevertheless, since then conservative activists have organized in the states to dismantle race-conscious policies in various aspects of the economy. The ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' in February 2024 is tracking 73 bills introduced in state legislatures in 2023–2024. Of these 8 have become law, 25 failed to pass, and the rest are pending. Two bills became law in Florida and Texas; and one each in North Carolina, North Dakota, Tennessee, and Utah.  Florida now prohibits public colleges from requiring  “political loyalty tests” as a condition of employment, admission, or promotion. The other Florida law prohibits public colleges from spending state or federal funds on DEI unless required by federal law. One Texas law prohibits DEI practices or programs, including training, that are not in compliance with the state Constitution regarding equality. The other law bans DEI offices and staff, as well as mandatory diversity training. It also bans identity-based diversity statements that give preference regarding race or sex.&lt;ref&gt;Chronicle Staff, "DEI Legislation Tracker: Explore where college diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts are under attack" ''Chronicle of Higher Education''  February 16, 2024.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entertainment and media===
Within the film industry, several prominent actors and directors have criticized recently implemented diversity standards, such as at the [[Academy Awards]]. Beginning in 2024, to be eligible for a best-picture nomination at the Academy Awards, a film must meet two of four diversity standards in order to qualify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buchanan|first=Kyle|title=The Oscars' New Diversity Rules Are Sweeping but Safe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/09/movies/oscars-best-picture-diversity.html|work=The New York Times|date=9 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor [[Richard Dreyfuss]] stated the Academy Award's diversity and inclusion standards "make me vomit", arguing that art should not be morally legislated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Murphy|first=Jim K.|title=Richard Dreyfuss Slams New Diversity Requirements for Oscar Contention: 'They Make Me Vomit'|url=https://variety.com/2023/film/news/richard-dreyfuss-slams-diversity-requirements-oscars-1235605443/|work=Variety|date=6 May 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several major film directors, who are voting members of the Academy Awards, anonymously expressed their opposition to the new diversity standards to ''[[The New York Post]]'', with one describing them as "contrived".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Giang-Paunon|first=Stephanie|title=Oscars voters slam Hollywood inclusion standards amid new diversity rules|url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/oscars-voters-slam-hollywood-inclusion-standards-new-diversity-rules|work=Fox News|date=17 June 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic [[Armond White]] attacked the new standards as "progressive fascism", comparing them to the [[Hays Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=White|first=Armond|title=Our Sovietized Oscars|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/09/academy-awards-diversity-rules-progressive-resolve-control/|work=National Review|date=11 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conservatism in the United States|Conservative]] media sources, such as ''[[National Review]]'', have also been frequent critics of DEI, with contributor George Leff arguing it is authoritarian and anti-[[Meritocracy|meritocratic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Diversity, Equity, Inclusion – Manipulating Words for Political Goals|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/diversity-equity-inclusion-manipulating-words-for-political-goals/|work=National Review|date=15 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
In the 2020s, DEI came into the spotlight in American politics, especially in state legislatures in Texas and other [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-controlled states.&lt;ref&gt; Faegre Drinker Biddle &amp; Reath LLP, "State Legislatures Targeting DEI in Higher Education" (Jun 29, 2023)

 &lt;/ref&gt;  Several states are considering or have passed legislation targeting DEI in public institutions. In March 2023, the [[Texas House of Representatives]] passed a bill with a rider banning the use of state funds for DEI programs in universities and colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Menchaca |first1=Megan |title=Texas House panel OKs funding ban for college DEI programs in draft budget.

Several prominent Republicans positioned themselves as critics, including Florida Governor [[Ron DeSantis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ron DeSantis announces plan to block DEI programs in state colleges |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/02/ron-desantis-block-dei-program-state-colleges-florida |access-date=26 March 2023 |work=The Guardian |date=2 Feb 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texas Governor [[Greg Abbott]],&lt;ref name="abcnews"/&gt; and 2024 presidential candidate [[Vivek Ramaswamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Terruso|first1=Julia|last2=Brennan|first2=Chris|title=Who is Vivek Ramaswamy?

====Military====
Another significant point of political controversy has been the implementation of DEI frameworks in the military, with Republican politicians frequently criticizing the efforts as "divisive" and as harming military efficiency and recruiting, while Democrats have defended it as beneficial and strengthening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shane III |first1=Leo |title=Military academies' diversity efforts draw GOP concerns, Dem support |url=https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2023/07/19/military-academies-diversity-efforts-draw-gop-concerns-dem-support/ |access-date=1 August 2023 |agency=Sightline Media Group |publisher=militarytimes.com |date=19 July 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2023, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] voted to ban all DEI offices and initiatives within the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] and military along partisan lines, with all Democrats and  four Republican members also opposing.

===Public boycotts===
Political opposition to corporate DEI efforts in the United States, particularly marketing criticized as "[[woke]]", have led to calls for boycotts of certain companies by activists and politicians; with notable examples being [[Disney]], [[Target (company)|Target]], [[Anheuser-Busch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bud Light loses top US beer spot after promotion with transgender influencer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/14/bud-light-loses-top-us-beer-spot-after-promotion-with-transgender-influencer |work=The Guardian |date=14 June 2023| access-date=1 Jan 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chick-fil-A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Valinsky |first1=Jordan |title=How Chick-fil-A became a target for going 'woke' |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/02/business/chick-fil-a-fake-controversy/index.html |access-date=21 June 2023 |publisher=CNN |date=2 June 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mordowanec |first1=Nick |title=Chick-fil-A Faces a Conservative Revolt |url=https://www.newsweek.com/chick-fil-conservative-backlash-diversity-1803387 |access-date=21 June 2023 |work=Newsweek|date=30 May 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentator [[Jonathan Turley]] of ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' described such boycotts as possessing "some success".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Consumers fight back, with some success, against brands gone woke |url=https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/4023005-consumers-fight-back-with-some-success-against-brands-gone-woke/|work=The Hill|date=27 May 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these companies' responses to the controversies have, in turn, sparked criticism from [[Progressivism in the United States|progressives]] of "walking back" or failing DEI commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stewart |first1=Emily |title=The Bud Light boycott, explained as much as is possible |url=https://www.vox.com/money/2023/4/12/23680135/bud-light-boycott-dylan-mulvaney-travis-tritt-trans |access-date=21 June 2023 |publisher=Vox |date=19 May 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Reuter |first1=Dominick |title=Target workers say the abrupt removal of Pride month displays has alienated some LGBTQ employees |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/target-workers-express-dismay-over-pride-month-display-removal-2023-5?r=US&amp;IR=T |access-date=21 June 2023 |work=Business Insider |date=24 May 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion===
A June 2024 poll by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and [[Ipsos]] found that 6 in 10 Americans believed that diversity, equity, and inclusion programs are "a good thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Telford |first1=Taylor |last2=Felton |first2=Emmanuel |last3=Guskin |first3=Emily |date=18 June 2024 |title=Most Americans approve of DEI, according to Post-Ipsos poll |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/06/18/affirmative-action-dei-attiudes-poll/ |access-date=30 August 2024 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A September 2024 poll by the [[Human Rights Campaign]] found that 80% of LGBT Americans would boycott a company that repealed its DEI programs and 19% would quit their job if their place of employment did.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Jared |last=Todd |date=September 4, 2024 |title=New Data Indicates LGBTQ+ Community Backlash Against Companies Backing Down from Diversity, Inclusion Commitments  |url=https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/new-data-indicates-lgbtq-community-backlash-against-companies-backing-down-from-diversity-inclusion-commitments |access-date=26 November 2024 |newspaper=[[Human Rights Campaign]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversy==

According to ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', institutions are making defensive adjustments to the criticism. Some schools are removing the word "diversity" from titles of offices and jobs; some are closing campus spaces set up for students according to identity; some are ending diversity training; and some have stopped asking all faculty and staff members for written affirmations of their commitment to diversity.&lt;ref&gt; Alecia Taylor, "3 Ways That Anti-DEI Efforts Are Changing How Colleges Operate" ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' (January 18, 2024) &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mandatory diversity statements within academia ===
The use of mandatory "diversity statements" within academia, wherein an applicant or faculty member outlines their "past contributions" and plans "for advancing diversity, equity and inclusion" if hired, has become controversial and sparked criticism.&lt;ref name="economist1"&gt;{{cite news |title=American universities are hiring based on devotion to diversity |url=https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/02/04/american-universities-are-hiring-based-on-devotion-to-diversity |access-date=25 March 2023 |newspaper=The Economist |date=4 Feb 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* offering virtual office hours, so students can get help even if they are unable to be on campus,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* having a flexible attendance policy for sick students,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and
* adding information from a greater variety of people (e.g., for an American history class, having students read historical letters written by both men and women, not only from men).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; --&gt;

The [[Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression]] (FIRE) has called such practices an attack on [[academic freedom]], stating that "[v]ague or ideologically motivated DEI statement policies can too easily function as [[Litmus test (politics)|litmus test]]s for adherence to prevailing ideological views on DEI" and "penalize faculty for holding dissenting opinions on matters of public concern".&lt;ref name="fire1"&gt;{{cite news |title=FIRE Statement on the Use of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Criteria in Faculty Hiring and Evaluation |url=https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/fire-statement-use-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-criteria-faculty-hiring-and |access-date=25 March 2023 |publisher=Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2022 survey conducted by the [[American Association of University Professors]], one in five American colleges and universities include DEI criteria in [[Academic tenure|tenure]] standards, including 45.6% of institutions with more than 5000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 2022 AAUP Survey of Tenure Practices |date=16 May 2022 |url=https://www.aaup.org/report/2022-aaup-survey-tenure-practices |publisher=American Association of University Professors |access-date=25 March 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some universities have begun to weigh diversity statements heavily in hiring processes.

Contrary arguments for training are that, "implicit bias training is crucial for addressing racism, and bypassing it cannot be justified under the First Amendment. While free speech is a fundamental right, it is not absolute and must be balanced against public health needs, including combating systemic racism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Varlack |first=Tiega-Noel |date=August 16, 2023 |title=Bypassing implicit bias training is not a First Amendment right |url=https://www.dailyjournal.com/article/374307-bypassing-implicit-bias-training-is-not-a-first-amendment-right}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Academic Freedom Alliance]] (AFA) has called for the end of required diversity statements, stating it "encourages cynicism and dishonesty" and erases "the distinction between academic expertise and ideological [[conformity]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=AFA Calls for An End to Required Diversity Statements |url=https://academicfreedom.org/afa-calls-for-an-end-to-required-diversity-statements/ |access-date=25 March 2023 |publisher=Academic Freedom Alliance |date=22 August 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social psychologist [[Jonathan Haidt]], who resigned from the [[Society for Personality and Social Psychology]] in protest against mandatory diversity statements, has stated that "most academic work has nothing to do with diversity, so these mandatory statements force many academics to betray their quasi-fiduciary duty to the truth by spinning, twisting, or otherwise inventing some tenuous connection to diversity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tuccille |first1=J.D. |title=Mandated Diversity Statement Drives Jonathan Haidt To Quit Academic Society |url=https://reason.com/2022/09/30/mandated-diversity-statement-drives-jonathan-haidt-to-quit-academic-society/ |access-date=25 March 2023 |publisher=Reason |date=30 September 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other criticisms include that it "devalues merit"; is connected to [[affirmative action]]; that it violates the [[First Amendment]]; or functions as a loyalty oath.&lt;ref name="economist1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Camp |first1=Emma |title=Want An Academic Job?

A 1,500-person survey conducted by FIRE reported that the issue is highly polarizing for faculty members, with half saying their view more closely aligns with the description of diversity statements as "a justifiable requirement for a job at a university", while the other half saw it as "an ideological litmus test that violates academic freedom".&lt;ref name="che"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Marijolovic |first1=Kate |title=Professors Are Sharply Divided on DEI Statements in Hiring, Survey Finds |url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/professors-are-sharply-divided-on-dei-statements-in-hiring-survey-finds |access-date=25 March 2023 |publisher=Chronicle of Higher Education |date=28 February 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Professor [[Randall L. Kennedy]] at [[Harvard University]], "many academics at Harvard and beyond feel intense and growing resentment against the DEI enterprise because of features that are perhaps most evident in the demand for DEI statements", stating "I am a scholar on the left committed to struggles for social justice. The realities surrounding mandatory DEI statements, however, make me wince".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Randall L. |title=Mandatory DEI Statements Are Ideological Pledges of Allegiance.

Several U.S. states have implemented legislation to ban mandatory diversity statements.&lt;ref name="che"/&gt; In 2024, MIT announced that diversity statements "will no longer be part of applications for any faculty positions" at the university, becoming the first major university to abandon the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sailer |first1=John |title=MIT becomes first elite university to ban diversity statements |url=https://unherd.com/newsroom/mit-becomes-first-elite-university-to-ban-diversity-statements/ |access-date=5 May 2024 |publisher=UnHerd |date=5 May 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equity versus equality===
According to DEI frameworks, "equity is different than equality in that equality implies treating everyone as if their experiences are exactly the same."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DEI Definitions |url=https://diversity.uiowa.edu/resources/dei-definitions |publisher=University of Iowa |access-date=26 March 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common identification, especially among critics, is of ''equality'' as meaning "[[equality of opportunities]]" and ''equity'' as "[[equality of outcome]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Minow |first1=Martha |title=Equality vs. Equity |journal=American Journal of Law and Equality |issue=1 |publisher=MIT |date=21 September 2021 |volume=1 |pages=167–193 |doi=10.1162/ajle_a_00019|s2cid=240522063 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Diversity, equality and the law in the UK |url=https://www.parliament.uk/globalassets/documents/education/online-resources/Diversity-Resource/Topic1.pdf |access-date=26 March 2023 |publisher=UK Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt; This difference between equity and equality is also called ''Dilemma of Difference''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1191571 Minow, Martha. "Learning to live with the dilemma of difference: Bilingual and special education." ''Law and Contemporary Problems'' 48.2 (1985): 157–211.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some have criticized the focus on equity rather than equality, arguing that the former runs contrary to a focus on merit or non-discrimination. Political scientist [[Charles Lipson]] has called "equity" a "mandate to discriminate", threatening the principle of "[[equality under the law]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lipson |first1=Charles |title='Equity' Is a Mandate to Discriminate |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/equity-is-a-mandate-to-discriminate-11614901276 |access-date=26 March 2023 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=4 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Canadian psychologist [[Jordan Peterson]], a frequent critic of DEI, has called ''equity'' "the most egregious, self-righteous, historically-ignorant and dangerous" of the three titular notions of DEI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Peterson |first1=Jordan |title=Jordan Peterson: When the left goes too far – the dangerous doctrine of equity |url=https://nationalpost.com/opinion/jordan-peterson-when-the-left-goes-too-far-the-dangerous-doctrine-of-equity |publisher=The National Post |access-date=26 March 2023 |date=10 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate has also branched into the realm of politics. Commenting on Governor of Texas [[Greg Abbott]] calling DEI initiatives "illegal", a spokesperson for his office stated: "The issue is not diversity – the issue is that equity is not equality. Here in Texas, we give people a chance to advance based on talent and merit."&lt;ref name="abcnews"/&gt;
&lt;!---(Not sure who added this here, and if it is not better placed somewhere else:) Women bear a disproportionate burden when it comes to unpaid work.

The numbers are 482.5 minutes per day for women and 454.4 minutes per day for men.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; These statistics show us that there is a double burden for women. ---&gt;

Martínez]] also published a ten-page document addressing the situation and clarifying Stanford's position on free speech. In it, Martinez stated that the university's commitment to DEI "can and should be implemented in ways that are consistent with its commitment to academic freedom and free speech" and that she believed that "the commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion actually means that we must protect free expression of all views."&lt;ref name="slsdean"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Martinez |first1=Jenny S. |title=SLS Letter from Dean |url=https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Next-Steps-on-Protests-and-Free-Speech.pdf |access-date=3 April 2023 |publisher=Stanford Law School |date=22 March 2023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She added that the commitment would not take the form of "having the school administration announce institutional positions on a wide range of current social and political issues, make frequent institutional statements about current news events, or exclude or condemn speakers who hold views on social and political issues with whom some or even many in our community disagree."

In April 2023, a group of 29 scientists, including [[Nobel laureate]]s [[Dan Shechtman]] and [[Arieh Warshel]], published a paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scientists Defend Merit in Science |url=https://indefenseofmerit.org/ |access-date=21 June 2023 |publisher=indefenseofmerit.org |date=28 April 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; that outlined what the authors see as a "clash in science between [[classical liberal]] values" and a "new [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] worldview", which, they argue, is "enforced by 'Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion' (DEI) officers and bureaucracies" and "threatens the entire scientific enterprise." Two of the authors, [[Anna Krylov]] and [[Jerry Coyne]], subsequently argued in an op-ed in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' that their emphasis on [[Meritocracy|merit]] – "once anodyne and unobjectionable [...] now contentious and outré, even in the hard sciences" – led to its refusal by major journals and subsequent publication in the ''[[Journal of Controversial Ideas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Coyne |first1=Jerry A. |last2=Krylov |first2=Anna I. |title=The 'Hurtful' Idea of Scientific Merit |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-hurtful-idea-of-scientific-merit-controversy-nih-energy-research-f122f74d |access-date=21 June 2023 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=27 April 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DEI has been criticized for not focusing on [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abrams |first1=Chaya M. |last2=Armeni |first2=Kelsey |title=The Lived Experiences of Anti-Semitism Encountered by Jewish Students on University Campuses: A Phenomenological Study |journal=American Journal of Qualitative Research |date=2023 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=172–191 |doi=10.29333/ajqr/13482 |url=https://www.ajqr.org/download/the-lived-experiences-of-anti-semitism-encountered-by-jewish-students-on-university-campuses-a-13482.pdf |access-date=5 November 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rosen |first1=Armin |title=Campus Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Excludes and Targets Jews |url=https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/campus-diversity-equity-inclusion-dei-excludes-targets-jews |access-date=5 November 2023 |publisher=Tablet Mag |date=4 October 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Programming's Antisemitism Failures; Buffalo Shooting and Great Replacement Theory |url=https://www.ajc.org/news/podcast/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-programmings-antisemitism-failures-buffalo-shooting-and-great |access-date=5 November 2023 |publisher=American Jewish Committee |date=19 May 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Andria Spindel of the Canadian Antisemitism Education Foundation, antisemitism has been largely ignored in the DEI curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Spindel |first1=Andria |title=DEI: Not diverse, equitable, or inclusive if antisemitism is ignored – opinion |url=https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-753992 |access-date=5 November 2023 |publisher=Jerusalem Post |date=8 August 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tabia Lee, a former DEI director at [[De Anza College]] in [[California]] and DEI critic, has criticized DEI for what she says is fostering antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carter |first1=Ray |title=Amid DEI Backdrop, OU Students Condemn Israel |url=https://ocpathink.org/post/independent-journalism/amid-dei-backdrop-ou-students-condemn-israel |publisher=Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs |access-date=5 November 2023 |date=27 October 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sfc"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Asimov |first1=Nanette |title='I declared myself not woke': What happened when a critic of anti-racism 'ideology' led DEI at a Bay Area college |url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/tabia-lee-de-anza-dei-17870145.php |access-date=5 November 2023 |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=14 May 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Brandeis Center]], the DEI committee at [[Stanford University]] said that "Jews, unlike other minority group[s], possess privilege and power, Jews and victims of Jew-hatred do not merit or necessitate the attention of the DEI committee" after two students complained about antisemitic incidents on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Overview of Complaints Filed Against Stanford University |url=https://brandeiscenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Stanford-Case-Materials-6-15-21.pdf |access-date=5 November 2023 |publisher=Brandeis Center |date=15 June 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a wave of [[2024 pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses|antisemitic incidents on American campuses in 2023–2024]], several Republican congressmen laid the blame on DEI, with [[Burgess Owens]] stating DEI programs "are anything but inclusive for Jews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Knott |first1=Katherine |title=House Republicans Blame DEI Programs for Rise in Campus Antisemitism |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/2023/11/15/house-republicans-blame-dei-programs-campus-antisemitism |access-date=11 December 2023 |publisher=Inside Higher Ed |date=15 November 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; DEI's lack of inclusion of Jews and contribution to antisemitism were similarly criticized by businessman [[Bill Ackman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CNBC Transcript: Pershing Square Capital Management CEO Bill Ackman Speaks with CNBC's 'Squawk Box' Today |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/06/cnbc-transcript-pershing-square-capital-management-ceo-bill-ackman-speaks-with-cnbcs-squawk-box-today.html |access-date=11 December 2023 |publisher=CNBC |date=6 November 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; and columnist [[Heather Mac Donald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mac Donald |first1=Heather |title=DEI Drives Campus Antisemitism |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/dei-drives-campus-antisemitism-harvard-ivy-ackman-israel-bds-b19ebd12 |access-date=11 December 2023 |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=6 December 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[2023 United States Congress hearing on antisemitism]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], one donor pulled a $100 million donation "because he thought the school was prioritizing D.E.I. over enhancing the business school's academic excellence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Saul |first1=Stephanie |title=Who Decides Penn's Future: Donors or the University? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/us/university-of-pennsylvania-donors-israel-hamas.html |access-date=11 December 2023 |work=New York Times |date=26 October 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politicization and ideology===
DEI has according to some critics{{Who|date=September 2024}} become a distinct ideology or "political agenda", leading to a politicization of universities.&lt;ref name="Fareed"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zakaria |first1=Fareed |title=Opinion: Why university presidents are under fire |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2023/12/08/opinions/israel-palestine-antisemitism-american-universities-zakaria/index.html |access-date=11 December 2023 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fareed Zakaria]], a commentator on [[CNN]], has criticized American universities for "[h]aving gone so far down the ideological path" that "these universities and these presidents cannot make the case clearly that at the center of a university is the free expression of ideas." He opines that "[t]he most obvious lack of diversity at universities, political diversity, which clearly affects their ability to analyze many issues, is not addressed."&lt;ref name="Fareed"/&gt;

Conservative activists in the United States such as [[Stephen Miller (political advisor)|Stephen Miller]] and [[Edward Blum (litigant)|Edward Blum]] have alleged that corporate DEI programs are a form of [[reverse discrimination]] against whites. While such complaints have historically been a small fraction of [[employment discrimination]] litigation, U.S. courts have seen an increase in reverse discrimination claims since 2020, with some individual plaintiffs being awarded damages against companies such as [[Starbucks]] and [[Novant Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Guynn |first=Jessica |date=20 December 2023 |title=DEI under siege: Why more businesses are being accused of 'reverse discrimination' |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/careers/2023/12/20/dei-reverse-discrimination-lawsuits-increase-woke/71923487007/ |access-date=2024-09-17 |website=USA Today |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dog-whistle diversity===
Author [[Christine Michel Carter]] coined the term "dog-whistle diversity" for ''Time'' in 2017.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=2017-11-29 |title=We Need to Talk About Dog-Whistle Diversity |url=https://time.com/5040120/dog-whistle-diversity/ |access-date=2023-06-21 |magazine=Time |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the phrase "[[Dog whistle (politics)|dog whistle politics]]", dog whistle diversity is defined as the hiring of groups who have historically been underrepresented or subject to discrimination by organizations for the social aspect of [[environmental, social, and corporate governance]] (ESG). To investors and stakeholders, hiring these groups sends a coded message that the organization is more open to a diverse workforce, but to the groups hired it suggests the organization lacks effective diversity management or inclusion.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

===Disability community===
According to some critics, DEI initiatives inadvertently sideline disabled people. Writing for ''The Conversation'' in 2017, college professor Stephen Friedman said that, "Organizations who are serious about DEI must adopt the frame of producing shared value where business and social goods exist side-by-side".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=2017-11-29 |title=Organizations are leaving disabled workers behind in their DEI efforts – here's how they can do better |url=https://theconversation.com/organizations-are-leaving-disabled-workers-behind-in-their-dei-efforts-heres-how-they-can-do-better-207800 |magazine=The Conversation |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a ''Time'' article in 2023, "People with disabilities are being neglected".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=2023-01-12 |title=Why Businesses Must Stop Disregarding People With Disabilities |url=https://time.com/6246262/businesses-must-be-inclusive/ |magazine=Time|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view has been echoed by a number of DEI leaders and activists. [[Sara Hart Weir]], the former president and CEO of the [[National Down Syndrome Society]] and co-founder of the Commission for Disability Employment, argues that when deliberating on the vision of DEI success in the United States, policymakers, and employers need to take proactive measures to engaging with people with disabilities who they historically ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=2021-04-21 |title=Op-Ed: Employers' diversity and equity efforts often overlook people with disabilities |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/06/op-ed-diversity-equity-efforts-often-overlook-those-with-disabilities-.html |magazine=CNBC |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corinne Gray has argued that, "If you embrace diversity, but ignore disability, you're doing it wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=2019-06-20 |title=Disability fashion: Stephanie Thomas is shaking up the fashion industry |url=https://www.urevolution.com/blogs/magazine/disability-fashion-stephanie-thomas |magazine=URevolution |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wording of some DEI initiatives can backfire and contribute to the self-perception of the hired person that they would not have been hired solely based on [[Equal opportunity#Formal equality of opportunity|formal merit]] and have only been hired due to a combination of their underrepresented identity and formal merit.&lt;ref name="c636"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Popat | first1=Aarthi | last2=Leonard | first2=Julia Anne | title='I'm here for my gender, not my skill': Causal reasoning shapes beliefs about merit in response to DEI initiatives | journal=Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society | volume=46 | date=2024 | url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6xx4t407 | access-date=25 July 2024 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term diversity hire can refer to problematic hiring strategies such as [[tokenism]].&lt;ref name="o024"/&gt; The term "DEI", when used as a term to disparage people (particularly Black Americans), has been described as an [[ethnic slur]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
