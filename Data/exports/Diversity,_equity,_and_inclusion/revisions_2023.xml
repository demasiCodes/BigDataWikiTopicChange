'''Diversity, equity, and inclusion''' (usually abbreviated '''DEI''') refers to [[organizational]] frameworks which seek to promote "the fair treatment and full participation of all people", particularly groups "who have historically been underrepresented or subject to [[discrimination]]" on the basis of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] or [[disability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title="DEI" — on Dictionary.com |url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/dei |access-date=2023-03-25 |website=dictionary.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three notions ([[diversity (politics)|diversity]], [[Social equity|equity]], and [[Social exclusion#Social inclusion|inclusion]]) together represent "three closely linked values" which organizations seek to institutionalize through DEI frameworks.&lt;ref name="mckinsey"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is diversity, equity, and inclusion? |url=https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-diversity-equity-and-inclusion |publisher=McKinsey &amp; Company |access-date=25 March 2023 |date=17 August 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some frameworks, primarily in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], substitute the notion of "equity" with ''[[Social equality|equality]]'': '''equality, diversity, inclusion''' ('''EDI''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="EDI" in Collins Dictionary |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/edi |publisher=Collins |access-date=25 March 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What does equality, diversity, and inclusion mean? |date=14 June 2022 |url=https://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/equality-diversity-and-inclusion/about-edi/what-does-equality-diversity-and-inclusion-mean |publisher=University of Edinburgh |access-date=25 March 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="EDI" in Cambridge Dictionary |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/edi?q=EDI |website=dictionary.cambridge.org |publisher=Cambridge University Press |access-date=25 March 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other variations include '''diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging''' ('''DEIB'''),&lt;ref name="cut"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Read |first1=Bridget |title=Inside the Booming Diversity-Equity-and-Inclusion Industrial Complex |url=https://www.thecut.com/article/diversity-equity-inclusion-industrial-companies.html |access-date=21 September 2022 |work=The Cut |date=26 May 2021 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DIVERSITY, EQUITY, INCLUSION AND BELONGING (DEIB) |url=https://www.bi.edu/about-bi/deib/ |website=bi.edu |publisher=[[BI Norwegian Business School]] |access-date=25 March 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging |url=https://diversity.ku.edu/about |publisher=University of Kansas |access-date=25 March 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''justice, equity, diversity and inclusion''' ('''JEDI''' or '''EDIJ'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hammond |first1=J.

''Diversity'' refers to the presence of variety within the organizational workforce, such as in [[Identity (social science)|identity]] (i.e. [[Gender identity|gender]], [[Cultural diversity|culture]], [[ethnicity]], [[Religious identity|religion]], disability, [[social class|class]] etc.), [[Aging|age]] or [[opinion]].&lt;ref name="mckinsey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abcnews"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Alfonseca |first1=Kiara |title=DEI: What does it mean and what is its purpose? |url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/dei-programs/story?id=97004455 |access-date=25 March 2023 |publisher=ABC News |date=10 February 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Equity'' refers to concepts of [[Social justice|fairness]] and [[justice]], such as fair compensation.&lt;ref name="abcnews"/&gt; More specifically, equity usually also includes a focus on [[Social inequality|societal disparities]] and allocating resources and "decision making authority to groups that have historically been disadvantaged",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Definitions |url=https://www.washington.edu/research/or/office-of-research-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/dei-definitions/ |publisher=University of Washington |access-date=25 March 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; and taking "into consideration a person’s unique circumstances, adjusting treatment accordingly so that the end result is equal."&lt;ref name="mckinsey"/&gt; Finally, ''inclusion'' refers to creating an organizational culture that creates an experience where "all employees feel their voices will be heard",&lt;ref name="mckinsey"/&gt; and a sense of belonging and integration.&lt;ref name="abcnews"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion |url=https://codeforamerica.org/about-us/diversity-equity-inclusion/ |access-date=2022-03-23 |website=Code for America |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DEI is most often used to describe certain "training" efforts, such as [[diversity training]]. Though DEI is best known as a form of [[corporate]] training, it also finds implementation within many types of organizations, such as within [[academia]], [[school]]s, and hospitals.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Grubbs |first=Vanessa |date=2020-07-23 |title=Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion That Matter |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=383 |issue=4 |pages=e25 |doi=10.1056/NEJMpv2022639 |pmid=32649073 |s2cid=220465926 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenkranz |first1=Kari M. |last2=Arora |first2=Tania K. |last3=Termuhlen |first3=Paula M. |last4=Stain |first4=Steven C. |last5=Misra |first5=Subhasis |last6=Dent |first6=Daniel |last7=Nfonsam |first7=Valentine |title=Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Medicine: Why It Matters and How do We Achieve It? |journal=Journal of Surgical Education |date=July 2021 |volume=78 |issue=4 |pages=1058–1065 |doi=10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.11.013 |pmid=33279427 |s2cid=227521028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, DEI efforts and policies have generated criticism, some directed at the specific effectiveness of its tools, such as [[diversity training]], its effect on free speech and academic freedom, as well as more broadly attracting criticism on political or philosophical grounds.&lt;!--see below--&gt;

==Overview==
In 2003 it was estimated that corporations in the [[United States]] spent $8 billion annually on diversity. After the [[election of Donald Trump]] and the ascent of the [[MeToo movement|#MeToo]] and [[Black Lives Matter]] movements, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine stated in 2019 that the DEI industry had "exploded" in size.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Newkirk |first1=Pamela |title=Diversity Has Become a Booming Business. So Where Are the Results? |url=https://time.com/5696943/diversity-business/ |access-date=25 March 2023 |magazine=Time |date=10 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within academia, a 2019 survey found that spending on DEI efforts had increased 27 percent over the five preceding academic years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=An INSIGHT Investigation: Accounting for Just 0.5% of Higher Education's Budgets, Even Minimal Diversity Funding Supports Their Bottom Line |url=https://www.insightintodiversity.com/an-insight-investigation-accounting-for-just-0-5-of-higher-educations-budgets-even-minimal-diversity-funding-supports-their-bottom-line/ |access-date=26 March 2023 |magazine=INSIGHT |date=16 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One 2020 estimate placed the size of the global diversity and inclusion market at $7.5 billion, of which $3.4 billion was in the United States, projecting it to reach $17.2 billion by 2027.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Global Diversity and Inclusion (D&amp;I) Industry |url=https://www.reportlinker.com/p06219616/Global-Diversity-and-Inclusion-D-I-Industry.html?utm_source=GNW |access-date=26 March 2023 |publisher=Global Industry Analysts |date=October 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; DEI is more common than D&amp;I, and represents many different methodologies.&lt;ref name="cut"/&gt;

In 2021, [[New York (magazine)|''New York'']] magazine stated "the business became astronomically larger than ever" after the [[murder of George Floyd]] in May 2020.&lt;ref name="cut"/&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' has also stated that surveys of international companies indicate that the number of people hired for jobs with "diversity" or "inclusion" in the title more than quadrupled since 2010.&lt;ref name="econ"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Workplace diversity programmes often fail, or backfire |url=https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/08/25/workplace-diversity-programmes-often-fail-or-backfire |access-date=26 March 2023 |magazine=The Economist |date=25 August 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods and arguments==
{{Further|Diversity (business)|Diversity education|Equity in education|Inclusion (education)|Inclusion (disability rights)}}
In a 2018 article, proponents of DEI argued that because businesses and corporations exist within a larger world, they cannot be completely separated from the issues that exist in society. Therefore, the authors argue the need for DEI to improve coworker relations and teamwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Gill |first1=Gurwinder Kaur |last2=McNally |first2=Mary Jane |last3=Berman |first3=Vin |date=2018-08-16 |title=Effective diversity, equity, and inclusion practices |journal=Healthcare Management Forum |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=196–199 |doi=10.1177/0840470418773785 |pmid=30114938 |s2cid=52019098 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through a DEI plan, organizations outline measures to be taken, including recruiting and retaining personnel, fostering effective communication channels, imparting relevant training, and regulating workplace conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Noah |date=2023-01-07 |title=Equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) in the workplace |url=https://diversityandinclusive.com/equality-diversity-and-inclusion-edi-in-the-workplace/ |access-date=2023-03-08 |website=Diversity And Inclusion |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2022 many academic institutions in the US have also started making commitments to DEI in different ways, including creating documents, programs and appointing dedicated staff members especially in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=University |first=Carnegie Mellon |title=Homepage - Diversity, Equity and Inclusion - Carnegie Mellon University |url=http://www.cmu.edu/diversity/index.html |access-date=2022-03-21 |website=www.cmu.edu |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Diversity, Equity and Inclusion - University of Houston |url=https://uh.edu/diversity-equity-inclusion/ |access-date=2022-03-21 |website=uh.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many accreditation agencies now require supporting DEI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Bohanon |first=Mariah |date=2022-03-16 |title=DEI in Accreditation |url=https://www.insightintodiversity.com/dei-in-accreditation/ |access-date=2022-10-01 |website=INSIGHT Into Diversity |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Diversity and Inclusion in the Standards {{!}} AACSB |url=https://www.aacsb.edu/educators/accreditation/business-accreditation/diversity |access-date=2022-10-01 |website=www.aacsb.edu |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As of 2014, information on DEI for both students and professors was widespread in colleges and universities, with many schools requiring training and meetings on the topic. Many scholarships and opportunities at universities even have a secondary purpose of encouraging diversity. Diversity in higher education can be difficult, with diverse students often feeling reduced to fulfilling a ‘diversity quota,’ which can carry a high emotional tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harris-Hasan |first1=Alandra |title=What Is Really Going On: Black Graduate Students in Higher Education |journal=Diverse Issues in Higher Education |volume=31 |issue=18 |date=9 October 2014 |pages=58 |url=https://www.diverseeducation.com/students/article/15095499/what-is-really-going-on-black-graduate-students-in-higher-ed }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DEI positions also exist with the goal of creating "allies" for [[State school|public school]] students through resources and staff training, in order to support students facing social disparities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Ph.D |first=Jay P.

==Criticism and controversy==
===Diversity training===
{{Further|Diversity training}}
[[Diversity training]], a common tool used in DEI efforts, has repeatedly come under criticism as being ineffective or even counterproductive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dobbin |first1=Frank |last2=Kalev |first2=Alexandra |title=Why Doesn't Diversity Training Work?

What is worse, they often backfire".&lt;ref name="econ"/&gt; A regular claim is that these efforts mainly work to protect against [[litigation]].&lt;ref name="econ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hbr"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bregman |first1=Peter |title=Diversity Training Doesn't Work |url=https://hbr.org/2012/03/diversity-training-doesnt-work |access-date=26 March 2023 |publisher=Harvard Business Reviews |date=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been criticized that there has been limited progress in achieving racial diversity in corporate leadership, particularly for Black professionals, due to a lack of diverse Chief Diversity Officers and a broad DEI focus that overlooks specific issues Black professionals face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brownlee |first1=Dana |date=August 11, 2022 |title=This Is Why Corporate DEI Tragically Fails Many Black Professionals |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danabrownlee/2022/08/11/this-is-why-corporate-dei-tragically-fails-many-black-professionals/?sh=4948ccbfefbc |newspaper=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study of 829 companies over 31 years showed "no positive effects in the average workplace" from diversity training, while the effect was negative where it was mandatory.&lt;ref name="hbr"/&gt; According to [[Harvard University]] professor in sociology and diversity researcher Frank Dobbin, "[o]n average, the typical all-hands-on-deck, 'everybody has to have diversity training' – that typical format in big companies doesn't have any positive effects on any historically underrepresented groups like black men or women, Hispanic men or women, Asian-American men or women or white women."&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

===Mandatory diversity statements===
The use of mandatory "diversity statements" within academia, wherein an applicant or faculty member outlines their "past contributions" and plans "for advancing diversity, equity and inclusion" if hired, has become controversial and sparked criticism.&lt;ref name="economist1"&gt;{{cite news |title=American universities are hiring based on devotion to diversity |url=https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/02/04/american-universities-are-hiring-based-on-devotion-to-diversity |access-date=25 March 2023 |newspaper=The Economist |date=4 Feb 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression]] (FIRE) has called such practices an attack on [[academic freedom]], stating that "[v]ague or ideologically motivated DEI statement policies can too easily function as [[Litmus test (politics)|litmus test]]s for adherence to prevailing ideological views on DEI" and "penalize faculty for holding dissenting opinions on matters of public concern".&lt;ref name="fire1"&gt;{{cite news |title=FIRE Statement on the Use of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Criteria in Faculty Hiring and Evaluation |url=https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/fire-statement-use-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-criteria-faculty-hiring-and |access-date=25 March 2023 |publisher=Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2022 survey conducted by the [[American Association of University Professors]], one in five American colleges and universities include DEI criteria in tenure standards, including 45.6 percent of institutions with more than 5000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 2022 AAUP Survey of Tenure Practices |date=16 May 2022 |url=https://www.aaup.org/report/2022-aaup-survey-tenure-practices |publisher=American Association of University Professors |access-date=25 March 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some universities have begun to weigh diversity statements heavily in hiring processes; for example, [[University of California, Berkeley]] eliminated three-quarters of applicants for five faculty positions in the [[life sciences]] exclusively on the basis of their diversity statements, in the hiring cycle of 2018–2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Heald |first1=Rebecca |last2=Wildermuth |first2=Mary |title=Initiative to Advance Faculty Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in the Life Science at UC Berkeley |url=https://ofew.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/life_sciences_inititatve.year_end_report_summary.pdf |website=ofew.berkeley.edu |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326051550/https://ofew.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/life_sciences_inititatve.year_end_report_summary.pdf |access-date=16 June 2023|archive-date=2023-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Academic Freedom Alliance]] (AFA) has called for the end of required diversity statements, stating it "encourages cynicism and dishonesty" and erases "the distinction between academic expertise and ideological conformity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=AFA Calls for An End to Required Diversity Statements |url=https://academicfreedom.org/afa-calls-for-an-end-to-required-diversity-statements/ |access-date=25 March 2023 |publisher=Academic Freedom Alliance |date=22 August 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social psychologist [[Jonathan Haidt]], who resigned from the [[Society for Personality and Social Psychology|SPSP]] in protest against mandatory diversity statements, has stated that "most academic work has nothing to do with diversity, so these mandatory statements force many academics to betray their quasi-fiduciary duty to the truth by spinning, twisting, or otherwise inventing some tenuous connection to diversity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tuccille |first1=J.D. |title=Mandated Diversity Statement Drives Jonathan Haidt To Quit Academic Society |url=https://reason.com/2022/09/30/mandated-diversity-statement-drives-jonathan-haidt-to-quit-academic-society/ |access-date=25 March 2023 |publisher=Reason |date=30 September 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other criticisms include that it "devalues merit", is connected to [[affirmative action]], that it violates the [[First Amendment]], or function as loyalty oaths.&lt;ref name="economist1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Camp |first1=Emma |title=Want An Academic Job?

A 1500-person survey conducted by FIRE reported that the issue is highly polarizing for faculty members, with half saying their view more closely aligns with the description of diversity statements as "a justifiable requirement for a job at a university", while the other half saw it as "an ideological litmus test that violates academic freedom".&lt;ref name="che"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Marijolovic |first1=Kate |title=Professors Are Sharply Divided on DEI Statements in Hiring, Survey Finds |url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/professors-are-sharply-divided-on-dei-statements-in-hiring-survey-finds |access-date=25 March 2023 |publisher=Chronicle of Higher Education |date=28 February 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several U.S. states have implemented legislation to ban mandatory diversity statements.&lt;ref name="che"/&gt;

===Equity versus equality===
According to DEI frameworks, "equity is different than equality in that equality implies treating everyone as if their experiences are exactly the same."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DEI Definitions |url=https://diversity.uiowa.edu/resources/dei-definitions |publisher=University of Iowa |access-date=26 March 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Murphy |first1=Colleen |title=Equity vs. Equality: What's the Difference? |url=https://www.health.com/mind-body/health-diversity-inclusion/equity-vs-equality |access-date=26 March 2023 |publisher=health.com |date=11 January 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common identification, especially among critics, is of ''equality'' as meaning "[[equality of opportunities]]" and ''equity'' as "[[equality of outcome]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Minow |first1=Martha |title=Equality vs. Equity |journal=American Journal of Law and Equality |issue=1 |publisher=MIT |date=21 September 2021 |volume=1 |pages=167–193 |doi=10.1162/ajle_a_00019|s2cid=240522063 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Diversity, equality and the law in the UK |url=https://www.parliament.uk/globalassets/documents/education/online-resources/Diversity-Resource/Topic1.pdf |access-date=26 March 2023 |publisher=UK Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have criticized this focus on equity rather than equality, arguing that the former runs contrary to a focus on merit or non-discrimination. Political scientist [[Charles Lipson]] has called "equity" a "mandate to discriminate", threatening the principle of "[[equality under the law]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lipson |first1=Charles |title='Equity' Is a Mandate to Discriminate |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/equity-is-a-mandate-to-discriminate-11614901276 |access-date=26 March 2023 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=4 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Canadian psychologist [[Jordan Peterson]], a frequent critic of DEI, has called ''equity'' "the most egregious, self-righteous, historically-ignorant and dangerous" of the three titular notions of DEI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Peterson |first1=Jordan |title=Jordan Peterson: When the left goes too far — the dangerous doctrine of equity |url=https://nationalpost.com/opinion/jordan-peterson-when-the-left-goes-too-far-the-dangerous-doctrine-of-equity |publisher=The National Post |access-date=26 March 2023 |date=10 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate has also branched into the realm of politics. Commenting on [[Governor of Texas]] [[Greg Abbott]] calling DEI initiatives "illegal", a spokesperson for his office stated "[t]he issue is not diversity — the issue is that equity is not equality.

===Effects of DEI policies on free speech and academic freedom===
In recent years, high-profile incidents of campus conflict have sparked debate about the effect of DEI on the campus environment, academic freedom and free speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FREEDOM OF SPEECH, DIVERSITY, AND INCLUSION |url=https://www.higheredtoday.org/policy-research/campus-climate-inclusion/freedom-speech-diversity-inclusion/ |publisher=American Council of Education |access-date=26 March 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New FIRE model legislation takes on DEI bureaucracy's chilling effect on campus |url=https://www.thefire.org/news/new-fire-model-legislation-takes-dei-bureaucracys-chilling-effect-campus |publisher=Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression |access-date=26 March 2023 |date=16 February 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Friedman |first1=Jonathan |title=WHEN DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION CLASH WITH FREE SPEECH—AND WHY THEY DON'T HAVE TO |url=https://pen.org/diversity-inclusion-clash-free-speech/ |access-date=26 March 2023 |publisher=PEN America |date=20 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2021 cancelling of an [[MIT]] guest lecture by [[astrophysicist]] [[Dorian Abbot]] after he criticized DEI programs led to media attention and controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Powell |first1=Michael |title=M.I.T.'s Choice of Lecturer Ignited Criticism.

The 2023 disruption of a talk by [[Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals]] Judge [[Kyle Duncan (judge)|Kyle Duncan]] at [[Stanford Law School]] sparked criticism and discussion in the media, with many focusing on the role of Associate DEI Dean Tirien Steinbach, who joined protesters in denouncing Duncan's presence on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Morey |first1=Alex |last2=Conza |first2=Sabrina |title=Stanford Law students shout down 5th Circuit judge: A post-mortem |url=https://www.thefire.org/news/stanford-law-students-shout-down-5th-circuit-judge-post-mortem |access-date=26 March 2023 |publisher=Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression |date=13 March 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Millhiser |first1=Ian |title=A new Supreme Court case could be the most important transgender rights decision ever |url=https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/3/14/23635663/supreme-court-transgender-sports-constitution-stanford-kyle-duncan-protest |access-date=26 March 2023 |publisher=Vox |date=14 March 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Goodman |first1=Sylvia |title=Stanford Law's Diversity Dean Is 'on Leave' as Controversy Boils Over a Disrupted Speech |url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/stanford-laws-diversity-dean-is-on-leave-as-controversy-boils-over-a-disrupted-speech |access-date=26 March 2023 |publisher=Chronicle of Higher Education |date=22 March 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the incident, the editorial board of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' opined that DEI offices have "become weapons to intimidate and limit speech".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Tyranny of the DEI Bureaucracy |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/judge-kyle-duncan-stanford-law-school-tirien-steinbach-dei-students-babc2d49 |access-date=26 March 2023 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=17 March 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steinbach replied with "Diversity and Free Speech Can Coexist at Stanford", published in the ''Journal'' the following week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Steinbach |first1=Tirien |title=Diversity and Free Speech Can Coexist at Stanford |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/diversity-and-free-speech-can-coexist-at-stanford-steinbach-duncan-law-school-protest-dei-27103829 |access-date=26 March 2023 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=23 March 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/stanford-dei-dean-escalates-battle-against-law-school-dean/ "Stanford DEI Dean Escalates Battle against Law-School Dean"] Ed Whelan, ''National Review'', March 23, 2023. Retrieved March 31, 2023.&lt;/ref&gt; Dean of Stanford Law School, [[Jennifer Martínez|Jenny S. Martínez]], also published a ten-page document addressing the situation and clarifying Stanford's position on free speech. In it, Martinez stated that the university's commitment to DEI "can and should be implemented in ways that are consistent with its commitment to academic freedom and free speech" and that she believed that "the commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion actually means that we must protect free expression of all views."&lt;ref name="slsdean"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Martinez |first1=Jenny S. |title=SLS Letter from Dean |url=https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Next-Steps-on-Protests-and-Free-Speech.pdf |access-date=3 April 2023 |publisher=Stanford Law School |date=22 March 2023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She added that the commitment would not take the form of "having the school administration announce institutional positions on a wide range of current social and political issues, make frequent institutional statements about current news events, or exclude or condemn speakers who hold views on social and political issues with whom some or even many in our community disagree", criticizing this definition of an "inclusive environment" by stating it "can lead to creating and enforcing an institutional [[orthodoxy]]."&lt;ref name="slsdean"/&gt;

In April 2023, a group of 29 scientists, including [[Nobel laureate]]s [[Dan Shechtman]] and [[Arieh Warshel]], published a paper which outlined what the authors see as a "clash in science between [[classical liberal]] values" and a "new [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] worldview", which, they argue, is "enforced by 'Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion' (DEI) officers and bureaucracies" and "threatens the entire scientific enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scientists Defend Merit in Science |url=https://indefenseofmerit.org/ |access-date=21 June 2023 |publisher=indefenseofmerit.org |date=28 April 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the authors, [[Anna Krylov]] and [[Jerry Coyne]], subsequently argued in an op-ed in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' that their emphasis on [[Meritocracy|merit]] – "once anodyne and unobjectionable [...] now contentious and outré, even in the hard sciences" – led to its refusal by major journals and subsequent publication in the [[Journal of Controversial Ideas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Coyne |first1=Jerry A. |last2=Krylov |first2=Anna I. |title=The 'Hurtful' Idea of Scientific Merit |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-hurtful-idea-of-scientific-merit-controversy-nih-energy-research-f122f74d |access-date=21 June 2023 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=27 April 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2023 suicide of former [[Toronto]] principal Richard Bilkszto led to a new wave of controversy surrounding DEI in the workplace and its impact on freedom of expression.&lt;ref name="cbc1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="globemail1"/&gt; Bilkszto had earlier filed a lawsuit against the [[Toronto District School Board]] in the wake of a 2021 incident at a DEI training seminar; Bilkszto was later diagnosed with "anxiety secondary to a workplace event", and claimed the session and its aftermath had destroyed his reputation.

===Antisemitism===
{{POV-section|date=November 2023}}

DEI has been accused of ignoring or even contributing to [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abrams |first1=Chaya M. |last2=Armeni |first2=Kelsey |title=The Lived Experiences of Anti-Semitism Encountered by Jewish Students on University Campuses: A Phenomenological Study |journal=American Journal of Qualitative Research |date=2023 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=172-191 |doi=10.29333/ajqr/13482 |url=https://www.ajqr.org/download/the-lived-experiences-of-anti-semitism-encountered-by-jewish-students-on-university-campuses-a-13482.pdf |access-date=5 November 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rosen |first1=Armin |title=Campus Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Excludes and Targets Jews |url=https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/campus-diversity-equity-inclusion-dei-excludes-targets-jews |access-date=5 November 2023 |publisher=Tablet Mag |date=4 October 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bedzow |first1=Ira |title=DEI Training Needs To Take Antisemitism Seriously |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/irabedzow/2021/11/24/dei-training-needs-to-take-antisemitism-seriously/ |access-date=5 November 2023 |publisher=Forbes |date=24 November 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Programming’s Antisemitism Failures; Buffalo Shooting and Great Replacement Theory |url=https://www.ajc.org/news/podcast/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-programmings-antisemitism-failures-buffalo-shooting-and-great |access-date=5 November 2023 |publisher=American Jewish Committee |date=19 May 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Andria Spindel, of the Canadian Antisemitism Education Foundation, antisemitism has been largely ignored in the DEI curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Spindel |first1=Andria |title=DEI: Not diverse, equitable, or inclusive if antisemitism is ignored - opinion |url=https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-753992 |access-date=5 November 2023 |publisher=Jerusalem Post |date=8 August 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between DEI and campus antisemitism came under further scrunity after the [[2023 Hamas attack on Israel|2023 Hamas attack on Israel]], and the subsequent [[2023 Israel–Hamas war|war in Gaza]].&lt;ref name="cjo"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Goldfarb |first1=Stanley |title=How DEI Inspires Jew Hatred |url=https://www.city-journal.org/article/how-dei-inspires-jew-hatred |access-date=5 November 2023 |publisher=City Journal |date=2 November 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Duggan |first1=Laurel |title=The DEI industry has an antisemitism problem |url=https://unherd.com/thepost/the-dei-industry-has-an-antisemitism-problem/ |access-date=5 November 2023 |publisher=UnHerd |date=31 October 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tabia Lee, a former DEI director at [[De Anza College]] in [[California]] turned critic, has claimed that DEI frameworks foster antisemitism due to its "oppressors and the oppressed" dichotomy where "Jews are categorically placed in the oppressor category",&lt;ref name="ocpa"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carter |first1=Ray |title=AMID DEI BACKDROP, OU STUDENTS CONDEMN ISRAEL |url=https://ocpathink.org/post/independent-journalism/amid-dei-backdrop-ou-students-condemn-israel |publisher=Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs |access-date=5 November 2023 |date=27 October 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; and described as "white oppressors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lee |first1=Tabia |title=When ‘Critical Social Justice’ Rules on Campus |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/critical-social-justice-campus-dei-woke-antisemitism-diversity-857bed9b |access-date=5 November 2023 |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=22 October 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has claimed that her attempts to include Jews under the "DEI" umbrella was resisted.&lt;ref name="sfc"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Asimov |first1=Nanette |title=‘I declared myself not woke’: What happened when a critic of anti-racism ‘ideology’ led DEI at a Bay Area college |url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/tabia-lee-de-anza-dei-17870145.php |access-date=5 November 2023 |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=14 May 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; When her critics asked the college trustees to oust her from her role, one counselor explicitly referenced her attempts to place Jewish students "on the same footing as marginalized groups".&lt;ref name="sfc"/&gt; The [[Brandeis Center]] likewise notes how the DEI committee at [[Stanford University]] alleged that "Jews, unlike other minority group[s], possess privilege and power, Jews and victims of Jew-hatred do not merit or necessitate the attention of the DEI committee", after two students complained about antisemitic incidents on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Overview of Complaints Filed Against Stanford University |url=https://brandeiscenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Stanford-Case-Materials-6-15-21.pdf |access-date=5 November 2023 |publisher=Brandeis Center |date=15 June 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--- needs further references before inclusion ===Dog-whistle diversity===
Author [[Christine Michel Carter]] coined the term "dog-whistle diversity" for ''TIME'' in 2017.&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=2017-11-29 |title=We Need to Talk About Dog-Whistle Diversity |url=https://time.com/5040120/dog-whistle-diversity/ |access-date=2023-06-21 |magazine=Time |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the phrase [[Dog whistle (politics)|dog whistle politics]], dog whistle diversity is defined as the hiring of groups who have historically been underrepresented or subject to discrimination by organizations for the social aspect of [[Environmental, social, and corporate governance|environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG)]]. To investors and stakeholders, hiring these groups sends a coded message that the organization is more open to a diverse workforce, but to the groups hired it suggests the organization lacks effective diversity management or inclusion.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;
---&gt;
===Disability community===

Sometimes DEI initiatives focus primarily on aspects of race, gender, and ethnicity, inadvertently sidelining disabled people. Writing for ''The Conversation'' in 2017, college professor Stephen Friedman said that "organizations who are serious about DEI must adopt the frame of producing shared value where business and social goods exist side-by-side".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=2017-11-29 |title=Organizations are leaving disabled workers behind in their DEI efforts — here's how they can do better |url=https://theconversation.com/organizations-are-leaving-disabled-workers-behind-in-their-dei-efforts-heres-how-they-can-do-better-207800 |magazine=The Conversation |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a ''Time'' article in 2023, "people with disabilities are being neglected".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=2023-01-12 |title=Why Businesses Must Stop Disregarding People With Disabilities |url=https://time.com/6246262/businesses-must-be-inclusive/ |magazine=Time|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view has been echoed by a number of DEI leaders and activists. [[Sara Hart Weir]], the former president and CEO of the [[National Down Syndrome Society]], and co-founder of the Commission for Disability Employment, argues that when deliberating on the vision of DEI success in the United States, policymakers and employers need to take proactive measures to engaging with people with disabilities who they historically ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=2021-04-21 |title=Op-Ed: Employers' diversity and equity efforts often overlook people with disabilities |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/06/op-ed-diversity-equity-efforts-often-overlook-those-with-disabilities-.html |magazine=CNBC |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corinne Gray has argured that "if you embrace diversity, but ignore disability, you're doing it wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=2019-06-20 |title=Disability fashion: Stephanie Thomas is shaking up the fashion industry |url=https://www.urevolution.com/blogs/magazine/disability-fashion-stephanie-thomas |magazine=URevolution |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and public backlash==
===Entertainment and media===
Within the film industry, several prominent actors and directors have criticized recently implemented diversity standards, such as at the [[Academy Awards]]. Beginning in 2024, to be eligible for a best-picture nomination at the Academy Awards, a film must meet two of four diversity standards in order to qualify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buchanan|first=Kyle|title=The Oscars' New Diversity Rules Are Sweeping but Safe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/09/movies/oscars-best-picture-diversity.html|work=The New York Times|date=9 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor [[Richard Dreyfuss]] stated the Academy Award's diversity and inclusion standards "make me vomit", arguing that art should not be morally legislated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Murphy|first=Jim K.|title=Richard Dreyfuss Slams New Diversity Requirements for Oscar Contention: 'They Make Me Vomit'|url=https://variety.com/2023/film/news/richard-dreyfuss-slams-diversity-requirements-oscars-1235605443/|work=Variety|date=6 May 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several major film directors, who are voting members of the Academy Awards, anonymously expressed their opposition to the new diversity standards to ''[[The New York Post]]'', with one describing them as "contrived".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Giang-Paunon|first=Stephanie|title=Oscars voters slam Hollywood inclusion standards amid new diversity rules|url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/oscars-voters-slam-hollywood-inclusion-standards-new-diversity-rules|work=Fox News|date=17 June 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic [[Armond White]] attacked the new standards as "progressive fascism", comparing them to the [[Hays Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=White|first=Armond|title=Our Sovietized Oscars|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/09/academy-awards-diversity-rules-progressive-resolve-control/|work=National Review|date=11 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative media sources, such as ''[[National Review]]'', have also been frequent critics of DEI, with contributor George Leff arguing it is authoritarian and anti-[[Meritocracy|meritocratic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Diversity, Equity, Inclusion — Manipulating Words for Political Goals|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/diversity-equity-inclusion-manipulating-words-for-political-goals/|work=National Review|date=15 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
In the 2020s, DEI came into the spotlight in American politics, with several prominent Republicans positioning themselves as critics, including Governor [[Ron DeSantis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ron DeSantis announces plan to block DEI programs in state colleges |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/02/ron-desantis-block-dei-program-state-colleges-florida |access-date=26 March 2023 |work=The Guardian |date=2 Feb 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor [[Greg Abbott]],&lt;ref name="abcnews"/&gt; and presidential candidate [[Vivek Ramaswamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Terruso|first1=Julia|last2=Brennan|first2=Chris|title=Who is Vivek Ramaswamy?

Several U.S. states are considering or have passed legislation targeting DEI in public institutions. In March 2023, [[Texas]]'s [[Texas House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] passed a bill with a rider banning the use of state funds for DEI programs in universities and colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Menchaca |first1=Megan |title=Texas House panel OKs funding ban for college DEI programs in draft budget.

Another significant point of political controversy has been the implementation of DEI frameworks in the military, with Republican politicians frequently criticizing the efforts as "divisive" and as harming military efficiency and recruiting, while Democrats have defended it as beneficial and strengthening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shane III |first1=Leo |title=Military academies' diversity efforts draw GOP concerns, Dem support |url=https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2023/07/19/military-academies-diversity-efforts-draw-gop-concerns-dem-support/ |access-date=1 August 2023 |agency=Sightline Media Group |publisher=militarytimes.com |date=19 July 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 July 2023, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] voted to ban all DEI offices and initiatives within the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] and military along partisan lines, with four Republican members also opposing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Carbonaro |first1=Giulia |title=Republicans Ban All Racial Diversity Offices Inside Military |url=https://www.newsweek.com/republicans-ban-racial-diversity-offices-inside-military-1812968 |access-date=1 August 2023 |work=Newsweek |date=14 July 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Uebelacker |first1=Erik |title=House Approves GOP Measure Banning Military DEI Initiatives by One Vote |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/house-approves-gop-measure-banning-military-dei-initiatives-by-one-vote |access-date=1 August 2023 |publisher=The Daily Beast |date=13 July 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public boycotts===
Political opposition to corporate DEI efforts in the United States, particularly marketing criticized as "[[woke]]", have led to calls for boycotts of certain companies by [[conservative]] activists and politicians; with notable examples being [[Disney]], [[Target (company)|Target]] and [[Anheuser-Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Valinsky |first1=Jordan |title=How Chick-fil-A became a target for going 'woke' |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/02/business/chick-fil-a-fake-controversy/index.html |access-date=21 June 2023 |publisher=CNN |date=2 June 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mordowanec |first1=Nick |title=Chick-fil-A Faces a Conservative Revolt |url=https://www.newsweek.com/chick-fil-conservative-backlash-diversity-1803387 |access-date=21 June 2023 |work=Newsweek|date=30 May 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentator [[Jonathan Turley]] of ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' described such boycotts as possessing "some success".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Consumers fight back, with some success, against brands gone woke |url=https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/4023005-consumers-fight-back-with-some-success-against-brands-gone-woke/|work=The Hill|date=27 May 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these companies' responses to the controversies have, in turn, sparked criticism from [[Progressivism in the United States|progressives]] of "walking back" or failing DEI commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stewart |first1=Emily |title=The Bud Light boycott, explained as much as is possible |url=https://www.vox.com/money/2023/4/12/23680135/bud-light-boycott-dylan-mulvaney-travis-tritt-trans |access-date=21 June 2023 |publisher=Vox |date=19 May 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Reuter |first1=Dominick |title=Target workers say the abrupt removal of Pride month displays has alienated some LGBTQ employees |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/target-workers-express-dismay-over-pride-month-display-removal-2023-5?r=US&amp;IR=T |access-date=21 June 2023 |work=Business Insider |date=24 May 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
