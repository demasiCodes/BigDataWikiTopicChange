==Criticism==

DEI training has been criticized as ineffective, due to the short time-frame of the courses and a focus on legal compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nathoo |first1=Zulekha |title=Why ineffective diversity training won't go away |url=https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210614-why-ineffective-diversity-training-wont-go-away |access-date=14 November 2021 |work=www.bbc.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative activists such as [[Christopher Rufo]] have criticized the ideological content of DEI programs, claiming they promote [[critical race theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=White House directs federal agencies to cancel race-related training sessions it calls ‘un-American propaganda’ |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/04/white-house-racial-sensitivity-training/ |access-date=14 November 2021 |work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;
