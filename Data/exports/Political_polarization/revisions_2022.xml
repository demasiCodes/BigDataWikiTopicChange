{{For|the [[social psychology]] concept|group polarization}}
'''Political polarization''' (spelled ''polarisation'' in [[American and British English spelling differences|British English]]) is the divergence of political attitudes away from the center, towards [[Ideology|ideological]] extremes.&lt;ref name="dimaggio-96"&gt;{{cite journal|last=DiMaggio|first=Paul|author2=Evans, John|author3=Bryson, Bethany|date=1 November 1996|title=Have American's Social Attitudes Become More Polarized?|url=http://educ.jmu.edu/~brysonbp/pubs/PBJ.pdf|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=102|issue=3|pages=690–755|doi=10.1086/230995|s2cid=144020785|access-date=22 April 2013|archive-date=4 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304022840/http://educ.jmu.edu/~brysonbp/pubs/PBJ.pdf|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="baldassarri-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fiorina-08" /&gt;

Most discussions of polarization in [[political science]] consider polarization in the context of [[political parties]] and democratic systems of government. In [[two-party system]]s, political polarization usually embodies the tension of its binary political ideologies and partisan identities.&lt;ref name="dimaggio-96" /&gt;&lt;ref name="baldassarri-08"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baldassarri|first=Delia|author2=Gelman, Andrew|date=1 September 2008|title=Partisans without Constraint: Political Polarization and Trends in American Public Opinion|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=114|issue=2|pages=408–446|citeseerx=10.1.1.69.255|doi=10.1086/590649|s2cid=222436264}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fiorina-08"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fiorina|first=Morris P.|author2=Abrams, Samuel J.|date=1 June 2008|title=Political Polarization in the American Public|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|volume=11|issue=1|pages=563–588|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.053106.153836|archive-date=17 June 2012|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abramowitz-08"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abramowitz|first=Alan I.|author2=Saunders, Kyle L.|date=27 March 2008|title=Is Polarization a Myth?|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=70|issue=2|page=542|doi=10.1017/S0022381608080493|s2cid=44020272|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8201173984497cef22b59d5c317f2f0f00e12108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bafumi-09"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bafumi|first=Joseph|author2=Shapiro, Robert Y.|date=27 January 2009|title=A New Partisan Voter|url=http://ftp.columbia.edu/cu/alliance/documents/EDF/Monday/Shapiro_Bafumi_reading.pdf|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=71|issue=1|page=1|doi=10.1017/S0022381608090014|s2cid=154400302}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some political scientists assert that contemporary polarization depends less on policy differences on a left and right scale but increasingly on other divisions such as religious against secular, nationalist against globalist, traditional against modern, or rural against urban.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=McCoy|first1=Jennifer|last2=Rahman|first2=Tahmina|last3=Somer|first3=Murat|date=January 2018|title=Polarization and the Global Crisis of Democracy: Common Patterns, Dynamics, and Pernicious Consequences for Democratic Polities|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=62|issue=1|pages=16–42|doi=10.1177/0002764218759576|issn=0002-7642|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polarization is associated with the process of [[politicization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chinn |first1=Sedona |last2=Hart |first2=P.

==Definitions and measurements==

Political scientists typically distinguish between two levels of political polarization: elite and mass. "Elite polarization" focuses on the polarization of the political elites, like [[party organizer]]s and [[elected officials]]. "Mass polarization" (or popular polarization) focuses on the polarization of the masses, most often the electorate or general public.&lt;ref name="mccarty-06"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/polarizedamerica0037mcca/page/|title=Polarized America : the dance of ideology and unequal riches|last=McCarty|first=Nolan|author2=Poole, Keith T.|author3=Rosenthal, Howard|publisher=MIT Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0262134644|at=[https://archive.org/details/polarizedamerica0037mcca/page/ Cambridge, Mass.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hetherington-09"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hetherington|first=Marc J.|title=Review Article: Putting Polarization in Perspective|journal=British Journal of Political Science|date=17 February 2009|volume=39|issue=2|page=413|doi=10.1017/S0007123408000501}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="layman-06"&gt;{{cite journal|author1-link=Geoffrey Layman|last=Layman|first=Geoffrey C.|author2-link=Thomas M.

===Elite polarization===

[[File:NOMINATE polarization.jpg|thumb|Political polarization in the United States House of Representatives (DW-Nominate scores)]]
Elite polarization refers to polarization between the party-in-government and the party-in-opposition.&lt;ref name=baldassarri-08/&gt; Polarized political parties are internally cohesive, unified, programmatic, and ideologically distinct; they are typically found in a [[parliamentary system]] of democratic governance.&lt;ref name="mann-12"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CQORs1_S2sgC|title=It's Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American constitutional system collided with the new politics of extremism|last=Mann|first=Thomas E.|author2=Ornstein, Norman J.|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|year=2012|isbn=978-0465031337|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705154533/http://books.google.com/books?id=CQORs1_S2sgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archive-date=2014-07-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mccarty-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=carmines-12/&gt;

In a [[two-party system]], a polarized [[legislature]] has two important characteristics: first, there is little-to-no ideological overlap between members of the two parties; and second, almost all conflict over legislation and policies is split across a broad ideological divide. This leads to a conflation of political parties and ideologies (i.e., Democrat and Republican become nearly perfect synonyms for liberal and conservative) and the collapse of an ideological center.&lt;ref name="mann-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mccarty-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="layman-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="carmines-12" /&gt; However, using a cross-national design that covers 25 European countries, a recent study shows that it is not the number of parties itself, but the way a party interreacts with another that influences the magnitude and nature of affective polarization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hahm |first=Hyeonho |last2=Hilpert |first2=David |last3=König |first3=Thomas |date=2022-11-07 |title=Divided by Europe: affective polarisation in the context of European elections |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/01402382.2022.2133277 |journal=West European Politics |volume=0 |issue=0 |pages=1–27 |doi=10.1080/01402382.2022.2133277 |issn=0140-2382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of studies on elite polarization focus on legislative and deliberative bodies. For many years, political scientists measured polarization in the US by examining the ratings of party members published by interest groups, but now, most analyze [[recorded vote|roll-call voting]] patterns to investigate trends in party-line voting and party unity.&lt;ref name="fiorina-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mccarty-06" /&gt; Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Taddy used the text of the Congressional Record to document differences in speech patterns between Republicans and Democrats as a measure of polarization, finding a dramatic increase in polarized speech patterns starting in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Gentzkow, Matthew, and Shapiro, Jesse, and Taddy, Matt [https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/politext.pdf Measuring Polarization in High-Dimensional Data: Method and Application to Congressional Speech]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass polarization===

Mass polarization, or popular polarization, occurs when an electorate's attitudes towards political issues, policies, celebrated figures, or other citizens are neatly divided along party lines.&lt;ref name="mccarty-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="layman-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="carmines-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="claassen-08"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Claassen|first=R.L.|author2=Highton, B.|date=9 September 2008|title=Policy Polarization among Party Elites and the Significance of Political Awareness in the Mass Public|journal=Political Research Quarterly|volume=62|issue=3|pages=538–551|doi=10.1177/1065912908322415|s2cid=154392221}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the extreme, each camp questions the moral legitimacy of the other, viewing the opposing camp and its policies as an existential threat to their way of life or the nation as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2016-06-22|title=Partisanship and Political Animosity in 2016|url=https://www.people-press.org/2016/06/22/partisanship-and-political-animosity-in-2016/|access-date=2019-10-26|website=Pew Research Center for the People and the Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=García-Guadilla|first1=María Pilar|last2=Mallen|first2=Ana|date=2019-01-01|title=Polarization, Participatory Democracy, and Democratic Erosion in Venezuela's Twenty-First Century Socialism|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=681|issue=1|pages=62–77|doi=10.1177/0002716218817733|issn=0002-7162|doi-access=free|s2cid=149617060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple types or measures of mass polarization. ''Ideological polarization'' refers to the extent to which the electorate has divergent beliefs on ideological issues (e.g., abortion or affirmative action) or beliefs that are consistently conservative or liberal across a range of issues (e.g., having a conservative position on both abortion and affirmative action even if those positions are not "extreme").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Abramowitz|first1=Alan I.|last2=Saunders|first2=Kyle L.|date=2008|title=Is Polarization a Myth?|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1017/s0022381608080493|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=70|issue=2|pages=542–555|doi=10.1017/s0022381608080493|jstor=10.1017/s0022381608080493|s2cid=44020272|issn=0022-3816}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Partisan sorting]]'' refers to the extent to which the electorate "sorts" or identifies with a party based on their ideological, racial, religious, gender, or other demographic characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mason|first=Lilliana|date=2015|title="I Disrespectfully Agree": The Differential Effects of Partisan Sorting on Social and Issue Polarization|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24363600|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=59|issue=1|pages=128–145|doi=10.1111/ajps.12089|jstor=24363600|issn=0092-5853}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Mason|first1=Lilliana|last2=Wronski|first2=Julie|date=2018|title=One Tribe to Bind Them All: How Our Social Group Attachments Strengthen Partisanship|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pops.12485|journal=Political Psychology|language=en|volume=39|issue=S1|pages=257–277|doi=10.1111/pops.12485|issn=1467-9221}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Affective polarization'' refers to the extent to which the electorate "dislikes" or "distrusts" those from other parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Iyengar|first1=Shanto|last2=Lelkes|first2=Yphtach|last3=Levendusky|first3=Matthew|last4=Malhotra|first4=Neil|last5=Westwood|first5=Sean J.|date=2019-05-11|title=The Origins and Consequences of Affective Polarization in the United States|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=129–146|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-051117-073034|issn=1094-2939|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientists who study mass polarization generally rely on data from [[opinion polls]] and election surveys. They look for trends in respondents' opinions on a given issue, their voting history, and their political ideology (conservative, liberal, moderate, etc.), and they try to relate those trends to respondents' party identification and other potentially polarizing factors (like geographic location or income bracket).&lt;ref name="dimaggio-96" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hetherington-09" /&gt; Political scientists typically limit their inquiry to issues and questions that have been constant over time, in order to compare the present day to what the political climate has historically been.&lt;ref name="claassen-08" /&gt;Some of recent studies also use decision-making games to measure the extent to which ingroup members discriminate outgroup members relative to their group members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hahm |first=Hyeonho |last2=Hilpert |first2=David |last3=König |first3=Thomas |date=2022-11-07 |title=Divided by Europe: affective polarisation in the context of European elections |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/01402382.2022.2133277 |journal=West European Politics |volume=0 |issue=0 |pages=1–27 |doi=10.1080/01402382.2022.2133277 |issn=0140-2382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent academic work shows how intolerance affects polarization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Tolerance and Compromise in Social Networks

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having systematically less tolerance at the ideological extremes can lead to polarization with opinions more polarized than identities. In contrast, intolerance among moderates helps cohesion.

Some political scientists argue that polarization requires divergence on a broad range of issues,&lt;ref name="dimaggio-96" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fiorina-08" /&gt; while others argue that only a few issues are required.&lt;ref name="baldassarri-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abramowitz-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bafumi-09" /&gt;

==Causes==
There are various causes of political polarization and these include political parties, [[redistricting]], the public's [[political ideologies|political ideology]], and the mass media.

===Party polarization===
Some scholars argue that diverging parties has been one of the major driving forces of polarization as policy platforms have become more distant. This theory is based on recent trends in the [[United States Congress]], where the [[majority party]] prioritizes the positions that are most aligned with its [[party platform]] and political ideology.&lt;ref name="ura-12"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ura|first=Joseph Daniel|author2=Ellis, Christopher R.|title=Partisan Moods: Polarization and the Dynamics of Mass Party Preferences|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=10 February 2012|volume=74|issue=1|pages=277–291|doi=10.1017/S0022381611001587|hdl=1969.1/178724|s2cid=55325200|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of more ideologically distinct positions by political parties can cause polarization among both elites and the electorate. For example, after the passage of the [[Voting Rights Act]], the number of conservative Democrats in Congress decreased, while the number of conservative Republicans increased. Within the electorate during the 1970s, [[Southern Democrats]] shifted toward the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], showing polarization among both the elites and the electorate of both main parties.&lt;ref name="mann-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abramowitz-98"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abramowitz|first=Alan I.|author2=Saunders, Kyle L.|title=Ideological Realignment in the U.S. Electorate|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=August 1998|volume=60|issue=3|page=634|doi=10.2307/2647642|jstor=2647642|s2cid=154980825}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="galston-09"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galston|first=William A.|title=Political Polarization and the U.S. Judiciary|journal=UKMC Law Review|year=2009|volume=77|issue=207|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/umkc77&amp;div=15&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, political polarization could be a top-down process, in which elite polarization leads to—or at least precedes—popular polarization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benkler|first1=Yochai|url=https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190923624.001.0001/oso-9780190923624-chapter-10|title=Network Propaganda: Manipulation, Disinformation, and Radicalization in American Politics|publisher=Oxford Scholarship Online|year=2018|publication-date=2018-10-01|doi=10.1093/oso/9780190923624.003.0010|isbn=978-0-19-092366-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, polarization among elites does not necessarily produce polarization within the electorate, and polarized electoral choices can often reflect elite polarization rather than voters' preferences.&lt;ref name="fiorina-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mccarty-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hetherington-09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="carmines-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="claassen-08" /&gt;

Political scientists have shown politicians have an incentive to advance and support polarized positions.&lt;ref name="beniers-07"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beniers|first=Klaas J.|author2=Dur, Robert|title=Politicians' motivation, political culture, and electoral competition|journal=International Tax and Public Finance|date=1 February 2007|volume=14|issue=1|pages=29–54|doi=10.1007/s10797-006-8878-y|s2cid=39796862|url=https://papers.tinbergen.nl/04065.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These argue that during the early 1990s, the Republican Party used polarizing tactics to become the majority party in the [[United States House of Representatives]]—which political scientists [[Thomas E.

With regards to [[multiparty systems]], [[Giovanni Sartori]] (1966, 1976) claims the splitting of ideologies in the public constituency causes further divides within the political parties of the countries. He theorizes that the extremism of public ideological movement is the basis for the creation of highly polarized multiparty systems. Sartori named this polarizing phenomenon [[polarized pluralism]] and claimed it would lead to further polarization in many opposing directions (as opposed to in simply two directions, as in a polarized two-party system) over policy issues.&lt;ref name="sartori-66"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sartori|first=Giovanni|title=European political parties: the case of polarized pluralism|journal=Political Parties and Political Development|pages=137–176|year=1966|doi=10.1515/9781400875337-006|isbn=978-1400875337}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sartori-76"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sartori|first=Giovanni|title=Parties and party systems : a framework for analysis|year=1976|publisher=ECPR|location=Colchester|isbn=978-0954796617|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywr0CcGDNHwC|edition=[Nouvelle édition]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="johnston-08"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Richard|title=Polarized Pluralism in the Canadian Party System: Presidential Address to the Canadian Political Science Association, June 5, 2008|journal=Canadian Journal of Political Science|date=17 December 2008|volume=41|issue=4|page=815|doi=10.1017/S0008423908081110|s2cid=154599342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polarization in multiparty systems can also be defined along two ideological extremes, like in the case of [[India]] in the 1970s.

Political fund-raisers and donors can also exert significant influence and control over legislators. Party leaders are expected to be productive fund-raisers, in order to support the party's campaigns. After ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]'', special interests in the U.S. were able to greatly impact elections through increased undisclosed spending, notably through [[Super PACs|Super political action committees]]. Some, such as ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' opinion writer [[Robert G. Kaiser|Robert Kaiser]], argued this allowed wealthy people, corporations, unions, and other groups to push the parties' policy platforms toward ideological extremes, resulting in a state of greater polarization.&lt;ref name="mann-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kaiser-10"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaiser|first=Robert G.|title=So damn much money : the triumph of lobbying and the corrosion of American government|year=2010|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0307385888|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJxU1MzQZVoC|edition=1st Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, such as Raymond J. La Raja and David L. Wiltse, note that this does not necessarily hold true for mass donors to political campaigns.

===The public===
In democracies and other [[Representative democracy|representative governments]], citizens vote for the political actors who will represent them.

[[Morris P.

Religious, ethnic, and other cultural divides within the public have often influenced the emergence of polarization. According to Layman et al. (2005), the ideological split between U.S. Republicans and Democrats also crosses into the religious cultural divide. They claim that Democrats have generally become more [[moderate]] in religious views whereas Republicans have become more traditionalist. For example, political scientists have shown that in the United States, voters who identify as Republican are more likely to vote for a strongly [[evangelical]] candidate than Democratic voters.&lt;ref name="campbell-11"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=David E.|last2 = Green | first2 = John C. | last3 = Layman | first3 = Geoffrey C. |title=The party faithful: partisan images, candidate religion, and the electoral impact of party identification|journal=[[American Journal of Political Science]]|date= January 2011|volume=55|issue=1|pages=42–58 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00474.x | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; This correlates with the rise in polarization in the United States.&lt;ref name="layman-05"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Layman |first1= Geoffrey C. | last2 =Green | first2 = John C. |title=Wars and rumours of wars: the contexts of cultural conflict in American political behaviour|journal=[[British Journal of Political Science]]|date=January 2006|volume=36|issue=1 |pages=61–89 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] |doi=10.1017/S0007123406000044 | jstor = 4092316 |s2cid= 144870729 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory contends that religion does not contribute to full-group polarization, but rather, [[coalition]] and party activist polarization causes party shifts toward a political extreme.&lt;ref name="brooks-04"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sociology.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/3858/A_Great_Divide.pdf|last=Brooks|first=Clem|author2=Manza, Jeff|title=A great divide?

In some post-colonial countries, the public may be polarized along ethnic divides that remain from the colonial regime.&lt;ref name="bhavnani-08"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhavnani|first1=Ravi | last2 =Miodownik | first2= Dan|title=Ethnic polarization, ethnic salience, and Civil War |journal=[[Journal of Conflict Resolution]] |date=February 2009 |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=30–49 |doi=10.1177/0022002708325945 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] |s2cid=145686111 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/dc0abd133a2ecbac1ad3e0a459f39869ef89a78d }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[South Africa]] in the late 1980s, members of the conservative, pro-apartheid [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] were no longer supportive of [[apartheid]], and, therefore, no longer ideologically aligned with their party.

[[Economic inequality]] can also motivate the polarization of the public. For example, in post-[[World War I]] [[Germany]], the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany|Communist Workers Party]], and the [[Nazism|National Socialists]], a [[fascism|fascist]] party, emerged as the dominant political ideologies and proposed to address Germany's economic problems in drastically different ways.&lt;ref name="sartori-66" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sartori-76" /&gt; In [[Venezuela]], in the late 20th century, presidential candidate [[Hugo Chávez]] used economic inequality in the country to polarize voters, employing a popular and aggresive tone to gain popularity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Márquez |first=Laureano |title=Historieta de Venezuela: De Macuro a Maduro |last2=Eduardo |first2=Sanabria |publisher=Gráficas Pedrazas |year=2018 |isbn=978-1-7328777-1-9 |edition=1st |page=151 |chapter=Llegó la dictablanda |author-link=Laureano Márquez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Redistricting===
The impact of redistricting—potentially through [[gerrymandering]] or the manipulation of electoral borders to favor a political party—on political polarization in the United States has been found to be minimal in research by leading political scientists. The logic for this minimal effect is twofold: first, gerrymandering is typically accomplished by packing opposition voters into a minority of congressional districts in a region, while distributing the preferred party's voters over a majority of districts by a slimmer majority than otherwise would have existed. The result of this is that the number of competitive congressional districts would be expected to increase, and in competitive districts representatives have to compete with the other party for the median voter, who tends to be more ideologically moderate. Second, political polarization has also occurred in the Senate, which does not experience redistricting because Senators represent fixed geographical units, i.e. states.&lt;ref name="mccarty-09"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCarty|first=Nolan|author2=Poole, Keith T.|author3=Rosenthal, Howard|date=1 July 2009|title=Does Gerrymandering Cause Polarization?|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=53|issue=3|pages=666–680|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00393.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="masket-12"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Masket|first=Seth E.|author2=Winburn, Jonathan|author3=Wright, Gerald C.|date=4 January 2012|title=The Gerrymanderers Are Coming! Legislative Redistricting Won't Affect Competition or Polarization Much, No Matter Who Does It|url=http://mysite.du.edu/~smasket/Redistricting.pdf|journal=PS: Political Science &amp; Politics|volume=45|issue=1|pages=39–43|doi=10.1017/S1049096511001703|s2cid=45832354}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument that redistricting, through gerrymandering, would contribute to political polarization is based on the idea that new non-competitive districts created would lead to the election of extremist candidates representing the supermajority party, with no accountability to the voice of the minority. One difficulty in testing this hypothesis is to disentangle gerrymandering effects from natural geographical sorting through individuals moving to congressional districts with a similar ideological makeup to their own. Carson et al. (2007), has found that redistricting has contributed to the greater level of polarization in the House of Representatives than in the Senate, however that this effect has been "relatively modest".&lt;ref name="carson-07"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carson|first=J.L.|author2=Crespin, M.H. |author3=Finocchiaro, C.J. |author4= Rohde, D.W. |title=Redistricting and Party Polarization in the U.S. House of Representatives|journal=American Politics Research|date=28 September 2007|volume=35|issue=6|pages=878–904|doi=10.1177/1532673X07304263|s2cid=154527252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politically motivated redistricting has been associated with the rise in partisanship in the U.S. House of Representatives between 1992 and 1994.&lt;ref name="mckee-08"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKee|first=SEth C.|title=The Effects of Redistricting on Voting Behavior in Incumbent U.S. House Elections, 1992–1994|journal=Political Research Quarterly|date=March 2008|volume=61|issue=1|pages=122–133|doi=10.1177/1065912907306473|s2cid=154836818|id={{ProQuest|215329960}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kousser-96"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kousser|first=J|title=Estimating the Partisan Consequences of Redistricting Plans – Simply|journal=Legislative Studies Quarterly|date=November 1996|volume=21|issue=4|pages=521–541|doi=10.2307/440460|jstor=440460|s2cid=153222480|id={{ProQuest|60821189}}|url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/80620/1/sswp929.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The media===
The mass media has grown as an institution over the past half-century. Political scientists argue that this has particularly affected the voting public in the last three decades, as previously less partisan viewers are given more polarized news media choices. The mass media's current, fragmented, high-choice environment has induced a movement of the audience from more even-toned political programming to more antagonistic and one-sided broadcasts and articles. These programs tend to appeal to partisan viewers who watch the polarized programming as a self-confirming source for their ideologies.&lt;ref name="mann-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hetherington-09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hollander-08"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hollander|first=B.A.|title=Tuning Out or Tuning Elsewhere?

Countries with less diversified but emerging media markets, such as [[China]] and [[South Korea]], have become more polarized due to the diversification of political media.&lt;ref name="yuan-07"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yuan|first=Elaine Jingyan|title=The New Multi-channel Media Environment in China: Diversity of Exposure in Television Viewing|year=2007|publisher=Northwestern University|isbn=978-1109940213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kim-11"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kim|first=S.J.|title=Emerging patterns of news media use across multiple platforms and their political implications in south korea|year=2011|publisher=Northwestern University|id={{ProQuest|873972899}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, most search engines and social networks (e.g., Google, Facebook) now utilize computer algorithms as filters, which personalize web content based on a user's search history, location, and previous clicking patterns, creating more polarized access to information.&lt;ref&gt;Rushkoff, D. (2010). ''Program or be programmed: Ten commands for a digital age.'' Berkeley, CA: Soft Skull Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This method of personalizing web content results in ''[[filter bubble]]s'', a term coined by digital activist [[Eli Pariser]] that refers to the polarized ideological bubbles that are created by computer algorithms filtering out unrelated information and opposing views.&lt;ref&gt;Pariser, E. (2011). ''The filter bubble: What the internet is hiding from you''. New York, NY: The Penguin Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study found ideological segregation of online news consumption is lower than the segregation of most offline news consumption and lower than the segregation of face-to-face interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Gentzkow|first1=Matthew|last2=Shapiro|first2=Jesse M.|date=2011-11-01|title=Ideological Segregation Online and Offline *|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=126|issue=4|pages=1799–1839|doi=10.1093/qje/qjr044|issn=0033-5533|hdl=1811/52901|s2cid=9303073|url=https://kb.osu.edu/bitstream/1811/52901/1/Mershon_ShapiroJ_photos_2011-10-27.pdf|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the filter bubbles effects of online media consumption are exaggerated.

M. 2021"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dahlgren |first1=Peter M. |title=Forced vs. Selective Exposure: Threatening Messages Lead to Anger but Not Dislike of Political Opponents |journal=Journal of Media Psychology |date=2021 |doi=10.1027/1864-1105/a000302|doi-broken-date=31 July 2022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People did, however, start to counterargue the content.&lt;ref name="Dahlgren, P. M. 2021" /&gt;

Academic studies found that providing people with impartial, objective information has the potential to reduce political polarization, but the effect of information on polarization is highly sensitive to contextual factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Duhaime|first1=Erik|last2=Apfelbaum|first2=Evan|date=2017|title=Can Information Decrease Political Polarization? Evidence From the U.S. Taxpayer Receipt |journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|volume=8|issue=7|page=736|doi=10.1177/1948550616687126|s2cid=151758489}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, polarization over government spending was reduced when people were provided with a "Taxpayer Receipt," but not when they were also asked how they wanted the money to be spent. This suggests that subtle factors like the mood and tone of partisan news sources may have a large effect on how the same information is interpreted. This is confirmed by another study that shows that different emotions of messages can lead to polarization or convergence: joy is prevalent in emotional polarization, while sadness and fear play significant roles in emotional convergence.&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert, M., Ahmed, S., Cho, J., Liu, B., &amp; Luu, J. (2018). Communicating with Algorithms: A Transfer Entropy Analysis of Emotions-based Escapes from Online Echo Chambers.

Research has primarily focused on the [[United States]], a country with high polarization that has also increased over time. In [[Sweden]], on the other hand, there is a stable ideological polarization over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oscarsson |first1=Henrik |last2=Bergman |first2=Torbjörn |last3=Bergström |first3=Annika |last4=Hellström |first4=Johan |title=Demokratirådets rapport 2021: polarisering i Sverige |location=Stockholm |publisher=SNS |year=2021 |isbn=978-9188637567 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments and surveys from Sweden also give limited support to the idea of increased ideological or affective polarization due to media use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dahlgren |first1=Peter M. |title=Media Echo Chambers: Selective Exposure and Confirmation Bias in Media Use, and its Consequences for Political Polarization |date=2020 |publisher=University of Gothenburg |location=Gothenburg |isbn=978-91-88212-95-5 |url=https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/67023?locale=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The political context ===
Some of recent studies emphasize the role of electoral context and the way parties interact with each other. For example, coalition partnership can moderate the extent of affective polarization over parties. Also, electoral context, such as electoral salience, involvement in elections, elite polarisation, and the strength of Eurosceptic parties, can intensify the divide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hahm |first=Hyeonho |last2=Hilpert |first2=David |last3=König |first3=Thomas |date=2022-11-07 |title=Divided by Europe: affective polarisation in the context of European elections |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/01402382.2022.2133277 |journal=West European Politics |volume=0 |issue=0 |pages=1–27 |doi=10.1080/01402382.2022.2133277 |issn=0140-2382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pernicious polarization ===
In political science, pernicious polarization occurs when a single [[Cleavage (politics)|political cleavage]] overrides other divides and commonalities to the point it has boiled into a single divide which becomes entrenched and self-reinforcing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=McCoy|first1=Jennifer|last2=Rahman|first2=Tahmina|date=2016-07-25|title=Polarized Democracies in Comparative Perspective: Toward a Conceptual Framework|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336830321}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most types of polarization, pernicious polarization does not need to be [[Ideological continuum|ideological]]. Rather, pernicious polarization operates on a single political cleavage, which can be [[Political party|partisan identity]], [[Religion|religious]] vs [[Secularism|secular]], [[Globalism|globalist]] vs [[Nationalism|nationalist]], [[Urban area|urban]] vs [[Rural area|rural]], etc.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=McCoy|first1=Jennifer|last2=Somer|first2=Murat|date=2019-01-01|title=Toward a Theory of Pernicious Polarization and How It Harms Democracies: Comparative Evidence and Possible Remedies|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|language=en|volume=681|issue=1|pages=234–271|doi=10.1177/0002716218818782|issn=0002-7162|doi-access=free|s2cid=150169330}}&lt;/ref&gt; This political divide creates an explosion of mutual group [[distrust]] which hardens between the two political parties (or [[Coalitions of parties|coalitions]]) and spreads beyond the political sphere into societal relations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; People begin to perceive politics as "us" vs "them."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Somer|first1=Murat|last2=McCoy|first2=Jennifer|date=2019-01-01|title=Transformations through Polarizations and Global Threats to Democracy|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=681|issue=1|pages=8–22|doi=10.1177/0002716218818058|issn=0002-7162|doi-access=free|s2cid=149764414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Causes====
According to Carothers &amp; O'Donohue (2019), pernicious polarization is a process most often driven by a single political cleavage dominating an otherwise pluralistic political life, overriding other cleavages.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|last=and|date=2019-04-01|title=Democracies Divided|url=https://www.brookings.edu/book/democracies-divided/|access-date=2019-11-24|website=Brookings|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Slater &amp; Arugay (2019) have argued that it's not the depth of a single social cleavage, but the political elite's process for removing a leader which best explains whether or not polarization truly becomes pernicious.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arugay, Slater|first=Aires, Dan|date=2019|title=Polarizing Figures: Executive Power and Institutional Conflict in Asian Democracies|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=62|pages=92–106|doi=10.1177/0002764218759577|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lebas &amp; Munemo (2019) have argued pernicious polarization is marked by both deeper societal penetration and segregation than other forms of political polarization, making it less amenable to resolution.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=LeBas|first1=Adrienne|last2=Munemo|first2=Ngonidzashe|date=2019-01-01|title=Elite Conflict, Compromise, and Enduring Authoritarianism: Polarization in Zimbabwe, 1980–2008|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|language=en|volume=681|issue=1|pages=209–226|doi=10.1177/0002716218813897|issn=0002-7162|doi-access=free|s2cid=150337601}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is agreed, however, that pernicious polarization reinforces and entrenches itself, dragging the country into a downward spiral of anger and division for which there are no easy remedies.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

====Effect on governance====
Pernicious polarization makes [[compromise]], [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]], interaction, and [[Toleration|tolerance]] increasingly costly and tenuous for individuals and political actors on both sides of the divide.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Somer, McCoy|first=Murat, Jennifer|date=2018|title=Deja Vu? Polarization and Endangered Democracies in the 21st Century|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=62|pages=3–15|doi=10.1177/0002764218760371|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pernicious polarization routinely weakens respect for democratic norms, corrodes basic [[Legislature|legislative]] processes, undermines the nonpartisan nature of the [[judiciary]] and fuels public disaffection with political parties. It exacerbates intolerance and [[discrimination]], diminishes societal [[Trust (social science)|trust]], and increases [[violence]] throughout the society. As well as potentially leading to [[democratic backsliding]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In country-by-country instances of pernicious polarization, it is common to see the winner exclude the loser from positions of power or using means to prevent the loser from becoming a threat in the future. In these situations, the loser typically questions the legitimacy of the institutions allowing the winner to create a [[hegemony]], which causes citizens to grow [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] towards politics. In these countries, politics is often seen as a self-referential power game that has nothing to do with people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vegetti|first=Federico|date=2019-01-01|title=The Political Nature of Ideological Polarization: The Case of Hungary|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|language=en|volume=681|issue=1|pages=78–96|doi=10.1177/0002716218813895|issn=0002-7162|doi-access=free|s2cid=199896426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effect on public trust====
Perniciously polarized societies often witness public [[Controversy|controversies]] over factually provable questions. During this process, [[fact]]s and moral truths increasingly lose their weight, as more people [[Conformity|conform]] to the messages of their own bloc. Social and political actors such as [[journalist]]s, [[academics]], and [[politician]]s either become engaged in [[Partisan (politics)|partisan]] storytelling or else incur growing [[social]], [[Politics|political]], and [[Economics|economic]] costs. Electorates lose confidence in [[Public institution (United States)|public institutions]]. Support for norms and [[democracy]] decline. It becomes increasingly difficult for people to act in a [[Morality|morally principled]] fashion by appealing to the [[truth]] or acting in line with one's [[Value (ethics)|values]] when it conflicts with one's party interests.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Once pernicious polarization takes hold, it takes on a life of its own, regardless of earlier [[intention]]s.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Benign polarization===
Several political scientists have argued that most types of political polarization are beneficial to democracy, as well as a natural feature. The simplifying features of polarization can help [[democratization]]. Strategies which depend on [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] and [[Social exclusion|exclusion]] are present in all forms of observed politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schattschneider|first=E. E. (Elmer Eric)|url=https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/catalog/bib_5918589|title=The semisovereign people: a realist's view of democracy in America|date=1975|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0030133664|location=Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political polarization can help transform or disrupt the [[status quo]], sometimes addressing [[injustice]]s or imbalances in a [[Populism|popular]] vs. [[Oligarchy|oligarchic]] [[Class conflict|struggle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stavrakakis|first=Yannis|date=January 2018|title=Paradoxes of Polarization: Democracy's Inherent Division and the (Anti-) Populist Challenge|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=62|issue=1|pages=43–58|doi=10.1177/0002764218756924|issn=0002-7642|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slater|first=Dan|date=2013|editor-last=Diamond|editor-first=Larry|editor2-last=Kapstein|editor2-first=Ethan B.|editor3-last=Converse|editor3-first=Nathan|editor4-last=Mattlin|editor4-first=Mikael|editor5-last=Phongpaichit|editor5-first=Pasuk|editor6-last=Baker|editor6-first=Chris|title=Democratic Careening|journal=World Politics|volume=65|issue=4|pages=729–763|doi=10.1017/S0043887113000233|issn=0043-8871|jstor=42002228|s2cid=201767801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political polarization can serve to unify, invigorate, or mobilize potential [[Alliance|allies]] at the elite and mass levels. It can also help to divide, weaken, or pacify competitors. Even the most celebrated [[social movement]]s can be described as a "group of people involved in a conflict with clearly defined opponents having a conflictual orientation toward an opponent and a common identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kriesi|first=Hanspeter|title=Comparative Politics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|isbn=978-0191851018|editor-last=Caramani|editor-first=Daniele|edition=4th|chapter=16. Social movements|doi=10.1093/hepl/9780198737421.003.0018|chapter-url=https://www.oxfordpoliticstrove.com/view/10.1093/hepl/9780198737421.001.0001/hepl-9780198737421-chapter-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political polarization can also provide voting [[heuristic]]s to help voters choose among [[candidate]]s, enabling political parties to mobilize supporters and provide programmatic choices.&lt;ref name="Polarized"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=James E.|url=https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691172163/polarized|title=Polarized|date=2016|isbn=978-0691172163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polarizing politics can also help to overcome internal differences and frame a common identity, based in part on a common opposition to those resisting [[reform]]s. Still, polarization can be a risky political tool even when intended as an instrument of democratization, as it risks turning pernicious and self-propagating.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Global perspective==
{{disputed section|date=November 2020}}
Outside of the U.S., there are plenty of modern-day examples of polarization in politics. A bulk of the research into global polarization comes from Europe. One example includes [[Pasokification]] in Greece. This is the trend from a shift from the center-left to a more far-left stance. Pasokification was caused by the Greek populous growing dissatisfied with the country's centrist more left-wing party and how they handled the [[Great Recession]] and the austerity measures the European Union put in place during recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blackwater|first=Bill|date=Summer 2016|title=Morality and left-wing politics: a case study of Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party|journal=Renewal|volume=24|via=Gale Literature Resource Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the shift further to the left was a massive benefits to the liberal population in Greece, the results in Greece, as well as other nations like Germany, Sweden, and Italy, have not been able to sustain themselves. Parties who have made the shift left have recently shown a decline in the voting booths, evidence their supporters are uneasy of the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eaton|first=George|date=2018|title=Corbynism 2.0|journal=New Statesman|volume=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010s, the shift in Greece to the far left is similar to the shift in countries like Poland, France, and the UK to more far-right conservative positions. Much of the polarization in these nations leads to either a more socialist left-wing party, or more nationalist right-wing party. These more polarized parties grow from the discontent of more moderate parties inability to provide progressive changes in either direction. In Poland, France, and the UK, there is heavy anti-Islam sentiment and the rise of [[populist]] commentary. The general population of the right in these countries tends to hold onto these more aggressive stances and pulls the parties further to the right. These stances include populist messages with Islamophobic, isolationist, and anti-LGBTQ language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zarkov|first=Dubravka|date=2017-06-16|title=Populism, polarization and social justice activism|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|volume=24|issue=3|pages=197–201|doi=10.1177/1350506817713439|issn=1350-5068|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palonen|first=Emilia|date=2009|title=Political Polarisation and Populism in Contemporary Hungary|journal=Parliamentary Affairs|volume=62|issue=2|pages=318–334|via=Electronic Journal Center|doi=10.1093/pa/gsn048}}&lt;/ref&gt;
