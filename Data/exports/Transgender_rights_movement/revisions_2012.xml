Rivera continued to be an advocate for transgender rights until her death in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbthistorymonth.com/glbthistorymonth/2006/bio.cfm?LeaderID=4 |title=GLBT History Month |publisher=GLBT History Month |date= |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Stonewall, awareness of transexuality grew considerably. Support groups for male cross-dressers were common in the 1970s and 80s. In the 1980s female to male ([[transman|FTM]]) transsexuality became common.&lt;ref name="glbtq2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/transgender_activism,3.html |title=&gt;&gt; social sciences &gt;&gt; Transgender Activism |publisher=glbtq |date= |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Transsexual people are frequently the victims of hate crimes. On December 31, 1993, a female to male transsexual [[Brandon Teena]] was murdered in [[Nebraska]] along with two of his friends. This murder was documented in the 2000 movie ''[[Boys Don't Cry (film)|Boys Don't Cry]]'' starring [[Hilary Swank]] as Brandon Teena.&lt;ref name="glbtq2"/&gt; In 2005, the movie ''[[Transamerica (film)|Transamerica]]'' told the story of a male to female transsexual preparing for sexual reassignment surgery and traveling across the United States with her bisexual son. The [[Transgender Day of Remembrance]] to commemorate those who lost their lives due to their gender identity was first held in 1999 following the murder of Rita Hester in 1998. The "Remembering our Dead" web project was also set up in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rememberingourdead.org/day/ |title=Transgender Day of Remembrance |publisher=Rememberingourdead.org |date=2005-11-20 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transfeminism]] is a form of transgender activism, which involves challenging dominant [[feminist]] narratives which typically only describe the experiences of [[cisgender]] women. [[Julia Serano]] is a notable transgender feminist.
