[[File:Respect and Equality for All Trans People (4764133272) (2).jpg |thumb|261px|Pride London, 3 July 2010.]] The '''transgender rights movement''' is a movement to promote [[transgender rights]] and to eliminate [[transgender inequality|discrimination]] and [[List of unlawfully killed transgender people|violence]] against [[transgender]] people regarding housing, employment, public accommodations, education, and health care.  In some jurisdictions, transgender activism seeks to allow changes to identification documents to conform with a person's current [[gender identity]].

== Issues of Concern ==
Individuals and groups concerned with the rights of transgender people have approached a litany of issues and questions in the course of their activism. Despite the relative obscurity of transgender issues in public conscience historically, a multitude of these issues have come to widespread attention in recent years.

=== Bathroom Legislation ===

==== Main Article: [[Bathroom bill|Bathroom Bills]] ====
Among these is the question of transgender individuals’ use of those public bathrooms which correspond to their gender identity. The bathroom issue first came to widespread attention in 2013 when the Colorado Civil Rights Division ruled that a public elementary school in [[Fountain, Colorado]] must allow transgender six-year-old Coy Mathis to use the girls’ restroom&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/18/us/in-colorado-a-legal-dispute-over-transgender-rights.html|title=In Colorado, a Legal Dispute Over Transgender Rights|last=Frosch|first=Dan|date=2013-03-17|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The case, along with Mathis and her family, was again brought to public attention with the 2016 release of the documentary ''[[Growing Up Coy]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/07/movies/growing-up-coy-transgender-documentary.html|title=‘Growing Up Coy’ Explores the Fallout After a Family Fought for Its Transgender Child|last=Buckley|first=Cara|date=2016-06-06|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the wake of the Mathis case, numerous states have put forth or passed so called ‘bathroom bills’, legislation which obligates transgender people to use the public bathroom corresponding to their biological sex at birth&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/-bathroom-bill-legislative-tracking635951130.aspx|title="Bathroom Bill" Legislative Tracking|last=Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|website=www.ncsl.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As of July 2017, sixteen states had considered such bills and one state, [[North Carolina]], has passed its bathroom bill into law. The North Carolina House Bill 2, or [[North Carolina House Bill 2|HB2]], was passed into law in February of 2017&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. HB2 quickly garnered attention as the first law of its kind and sparked high-profile condemnation, including cancellations of concerts and sporting events by the likes of [[Bruce Springsteen]] and the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/19/the-tumultuous-recent-history-of-north-carolinas-bathroom-bill-which-could-be-repealed/|title=Analysis {{!}} The tumultuous history of North Carolina’s bathroom bill, which is on its way to repeal|last=Phillips|first=Amber|date=2017-03-30|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the midst of the controversy and the inauguration of a new governor of North Carolina, the bill was repealed by the state legislature on March 30 of 2017&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.

=== In Education ===
The treatment of transgender people in educational environments has often been a focal point of the movement’s concern. In a survey of Canadian high schools conducted between 2007 and 2009, 74% of students who identified themselves as trans reported having experienced verbal harassment over their gender expression, 37% reported physical harassment over their gender expression, and 49% of trans students reported at least one instance of sexual harassment within the last school year&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mygsa.ca/setting-gsa/homophobia-transphobia-statistics|title=Homophobia and Transphobia Statistics {{!}} MyGSA|website=mygsa.ca|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.         

===Statistics of oppression===

In a survey conducted by [[National Center for Transgender Equality]]
and [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]], called "Injustice at Every Turn: A Report of the National Transgender Discrimination Survey", respondents reported that 90% of them had experienced discrimination and harassment in the work place and at school. The trans community experiences rates of unemployment that are double the national average. Additionally, one out of every twelve trans women, and one out of every eight trans women of color, are violently murdered (the nature of these crimes is often perpetrated in such a way that attempts to dehumanize the victim).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grant|first1=Jaime M.|last2=Mottet|first2=Lisa A.|last3=Tanis|first3=Justin|last4=Harrison|first4=Jack|last5=Herman|first5=Jody L.|last6=Keisling|first6=Mara|title=Injustice at Every Turn: A Report of the National Transgender  Discrimination Survey|url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf|publisher=National Center for Transgender Equality  and National Gay and Lesbian Task Force}}&lt;/ref&gt; (For more details refer to [[Transgender inequality]]). 

===Intersectionality===

Transgender people who belong to a different race, social class, age group, or sexual orientation may face different issues in securing rights than those of other groups.

===People of color===

'''Transgender people of color''' often face an identity that is under speculation, suspicion, doubt, and policing. Those within the community are often left out  from the wealthy, able-bodied, American, and white experience that those in the non-trans community often focus on, and are subject to discrimination as a transgender and as a person of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What trans people of color fear after the Bruce Jenner media circus|url = http://fusion.net/story/125983/what-trans-people-of-color-fear-after-bruce-jenner-media-circus/|website = Fusion|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, this is in part due to the rejection of an individual by family members at a young age. “The majority of transgender women of color,” state Juline A. Koken, David S. Bimbi, and Jeffrey T. Parsons, “experience verbal and physical abuse at the hands of their family members upon disclosing their transgender identity."&lt;ref&gt;Juline A. Koken, David S. Bimbi, and Jeffrey T. Parsons,
 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2840628/, "Experiences of Familial Acceptance – Rejection among Transwomen of Color.], ''Journal of Family Psychology, 2009. Retrieved 2017-11-15.''&lt;/ref&gt; For many, this alone is a leading factor that pushes them to leave the house, thus becoming fiscally independent and potentially homeless.

As transgender women of color face both gender and racial discrimination, their experiences may be qualitatively different from white transgender women. African American and Latino families are deeply rooted in religious tradition, which may lead to more socially conservative and rigid ideas about gender roles, homosexuality, and traditionalism, and many transgender women of color state that their parents’ negative reactions are largely due to the role religious beliefs play on their lives. In addition, parents also worry that their children will face additional hardships as members of “double minorities” (being Latina or African American, as well as transgender.)&lt;ref&gt;Juline A. Koken, David S. Bimbi, and Jeffrey T. Parsons,
 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2840628/, "Experiences of Familial Acceptance – Rejection among Transwomen of Color.], ''Journal of Family Psychology, 2009. Retrieved 2017-11-15.''&lt;/ref&gt; Gay and lesbian men and women of color often have trouble balancing appeasing their families and themselves, and are statistically more inclined to delay the coming out process or be closeted altogether.

Some of the ways white transgender people have more '''[[white privilege|privilege]]''' than those of their colored counterparts include racialized violence, better pay, better representation and benefits from the mainstream media movement. According to a National Transgender Discrimination survey, the combination of anti-transgender bias and individual racism results in transgender people of color being 6 times more likely to experience physical violence when interacting with the police compared to cisgender White people, two-thirds of LGBT homicide victims being transgender women of color, and a startling 78% attempt suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 5 Ways White Transgender People Have Privilege Over Transgender People of Color|url = http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/06/transgender-women-disproportionately-targeted-violent-hate-crimes|website = BGD|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bustle|url = http://www.bustle.com/articles/87452-5-shocking-facts-about-transgender-suicide-and-violence-that-you-need-to-know|website = www.bustle.com|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 17 homicides of trans and gender-nonconforming people in 2017 that the project has counted so far, 16 had been people of color; 15 had been transgender women; and 13 had been black transgender women. &lt;ref&gt;Emily Waters and Sue Yacka-Bible, [http://avp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/NCAVP-A-Crisis-of-Hate-Final.pdf, "“A Crisis of Hate: A Mid Year Report on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Hate Violence Homicides"], ''National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs''. Retrieved 2017-11-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs|NCAVP]] survey also found that trans survivors were 1.7 times more likely to be the victims of sexual violence than cis-gender survivors. Transgender/non-conforming individuals also reported over four times the national average of HIV infection (0.6% compared to 2.64%, respectively) with rates for transgender women (3.76%) and those who are unemployed (4.67%) even higher.&lt;ref&gt;Jaime Grant et. al, [http://nursingstudentsforsexualandreproductivehealth.org/resources/Pictures/Trans-Health-Supplements.pdf, "National Transgender Discrimination Survey Report on Health and Health Care", ''National Center for Transgender Equality''.

Eugene: Resource Publications, 2017. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, 41% of respondents reported attempting suicide compared to 1.6% of the general population with unemployment, low income, and assault (both sexual and physical) raising the risk factors.&lt;ref&gt;Jaime Grant et. al, [http://nursingstudentsforsexualandreproductivehealth.org/resources/Pictures/Trans-Health-Supplements.pdf, "National Transgender Discrimination Survey Report on Health and Health Care", ''National Center for Transgender Equality''.

The pure social stigma of being transgender is a root cause for poor health care, which manifests into other areas of transgender people. Social determinants of health, including violence and discrimination, may result in negative personal psychological and physiological effects. The access to proper health care is essential in both the transitioning and resilience. In a study of resilience of transgender people of color, Jay, a 41-year-old FTM POC, stated he “had no place to turn to get help in transition—and worked five jobs trying to save money for surgery that [he] never knew if [he] would be able to afford.”&lt;ref&gt;Vel S. McKelroy and Anneliese A. Singh, [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1534765610369261, "Just Getting Out of Bed is a Revolutionary Act: The Resilience of Transgender People of Color Who Have Survived Traumatic Life Events"], ''Traumatology'', 2011. Retrieved 2017-11-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Another key factor to the resilience to opposition of transgender POC involved having a strong sense of pride in both ethnic and gender identities. Developing this sense of pride can be a process, which involves overcoming barriers such as transphobia and racism. However, once these barriers are in fact crossed, transgender POC can start to see themselves in a better light and use their inner strength and confidence to be more persistent, optimistic, and positivity-oriented. 

In recent years, there have been several housing crises among transgender people, especially transgender people of color. According to a 2016 Gallup poll, 10.052 million people in the United States identify as lesbian, gay, or transgender, and millennials, or those born between 1980 and 1998, drive virtually all of all of the increases overall LGBT self-identification.&lt;ref&gt;Gary J.

There is a definite predominance of sex-segregated bathrooms, locker rooms, and housing where transgender people regularly are denied access, and are harassed and challenged for their gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;Kristie L.

Trans communities also experience problems with intersectionality when it comes to traditional male and female gender roles. The experiences trans men face are vastly different than those of trans women; trans men who were raised as female were treated differently as soon as they came out as male. They gained professional experience, but lost intimacy; exuded authority, but caused fear.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Alter, [http://time.com/transgender-men-sexism/, "Transgender Men See Sexism From Both Sides"], ''Time''.

==History==

Identifying the boundaries of a trans movement has been a matter of some debate. Conventionally, evidence of a codified political identity emerges in 1952, when [[Virginia Prince]], a male [[crossdresser]], along with others, launched ''[[Virginia_Prince#Transvestia_magazine|Transvestia: The Journal of the American Society for Equality in Dress.]]''&lt;ref name="glbtq1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/transgender_activism.html |title=&gt;&gt; social sciences &gt;&gt; Transgender Activism |publisher=glbtq |date= |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This publication is considered by some to be the beginning of the transgender rights movement in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="glbtq1"/&gt; In 1969, transgender and [[transsexual]] people played an integral part in the [[Stonewall Riots]], including [[Sylvia Rae Rivera]] and [[Marsha P. Johnson]], trans women who were instigators in the uprising. Rivera continued to be an advocate for transgender rights until her death in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glbthistorymonth.com/glbthistorymonth/2006/bio.cfm?LeaderID=4 |title=GLBT History Month |publisher=GLBT History Month |date= |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Stonewall, awareness of transsexuality grew considerably.{{cn|date=July 2017}} Support groups for male cross-dressers were common in the 1970s and 80s.{{cn|date=July 2017}} In the 1980s female to male ([[transman|FTM]]) transsexuality became common.&lt;ref name="glbtq2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/transgender_activism,3.html |title=&gt;&gt; social sciences &gt;&gt; Transgender Activism |publisher=glbtq |date= |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Contrary to these sociohistorical boundaries, [[Leslie Feinberg]] explodes the boundaries of trans activism by extending the history of the movement back to antiquity, and broadening the community to form partnerships with all people who are oppressed by the apparatus of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feinberg|first1=Leslie|title=Transgender Warriors: Making History from Joan of Arc to RuPaul|date=1996|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Stonewall, other events had occurred and have long been forgotten and removed from the narrative. One of these events is the [[Cooper Do-nuts Riot|Cooper Do-Nuts Riot]] of 1959 in Downtown Los Angeles that took place nearly a decade before Stonewall. However, this incident has been erased from the public memory, “since almost no documentation appears to have survived… Nevertheless the Cooper Do-nuts event its traces remain in the archival imaginary of the transgender community as a defining moment in its existence”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilliland|first=AJ|last2=Caswell|first2=M|date=2016|title=Records and Their Imaginaries: Imagining the Impossible, Making Possible the Imagined|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7xn3w83m#|journal=Archival Science|volume=16|pages=12-13|via=eScholarship}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This shows that it is difficult to get the history behind all the events that led up to the transgender rights movement because there are events that have been forgotten or the evidence about these events have been deleted. The only source of historical information left are personal stories that survivors from these incidents have. 

In 1992 Leslie Feinberg printed and circulated a pamphlet titled "Transgender Liberation: A Movement Whose Time Has Come". Feinberg's pamphlet begins by calling on the trans community to compose their own definitions, invoking language as a tool that unites people divided by oppression. From here, Feinberg traces the emergence of oppression imposed by the ruling class by means of institutions. These institutions, run by the elite, enforce a gender binary at the expense of communal societies that encouraged liberal gender expression. Women were devalued and effeminacy was disparaged to promote patriarchal economic privilege. According to Feinberg, the [[gender binary]] is a contrivance of Western civilization. Having acknowledged this, Feinberg encourages all humans to reclaim the natural continuum of [[gender expression]] that identifies trans individuals as sacred. Feinberg concludes by empowering the [[working class]] to liberate themselves from the [[ruling class]], which can be achieved by directing the [[wage labor|labor]] of [[marginalized groups]] towards the common goal of revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Feinberg |first1=Leslie |title=Transgender Liberation: A Movement Whose Time Has Come |date=1992 |publisher=World View Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, [[Adela Vázquez]], a Latina transgender woman, protested for in [[San Francisco]] in consideration of the government removing the transgender community from the workforce because they labeled the trans community as disabled&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Finding a Home in Transgender Activism in San Francisco|last=Vázquez|first=Adela|work=Queer Brown Voices: Personal Narratives of Latina/o LGBT Activism|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2015|isbn=|editor-last=Quesada|editor-first=Uriel|location=|pages=216-17|editor-last2=Gomez|editor-first2=Letitia|editor-last3=Vidal-Ortiz|editor-first3=Salvador}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, that situation is making some progress and is changing. In 2014, per The Nation Gay and Lesbian Task Force record, only 17 states (and the District of Columbia) in the United States of America have laws that protect individuals in the transgender community, which equals to about 45%. States that present these protections are: [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], [[Hawaii]], [[Illinois]], [[Iowa]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Minnesota]], [[New Jersey]], [[New Mexico]], [[Nevada]], [[Oregon]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Vermont]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[Wisconsin]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transgender Americans and Public Policy|last=Jerkins|first=Andrea|work=Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Civil Right: A Public Policy Agenda for Uniting a Divided America|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC|year=2015|isbn=|editor-last=Swan|editor-first=Wallace|location=|pages=173-77}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

On December 31, 1993, a [[trans man]] named [[Brandon Teena]] was murdered in [[Nebraska]] along with two of his friends. This murder was documented in the 1999 movie ''[[Boys Don't Cry (film)|Boys Don't Cry]]'' starring [[Hilary Swank]] as Brandon Teena.&lt;ref name="glbtq2"/&gt; 

[[Transgender Day of Remembrance]], an annual ceremony to commemorate those who lost their lives due to their gender identity, was first held in 1999 following the murder of [[Rita Hester]] in 1998. The "Remembering our Dead" web project was also set up in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rememberingourdead.org/day/ |title=Transgender Day of Remembrance |publisher=Rememberingourdead.org |date=2005-11-20 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012 [[CeCe McDonald]] was wrongfully imprisoned for having defended herself against neo-nazi attackers with a pair of scissors, which resulted in the death of one of her assailants. Her story was publicized by a [[GLAAD Media Award]] winning article in [[Ebony.com]]. [[Laverne Cox]], openly trans actress on [[Orange Is the New Black]], launched a campaign to raise consciousness of cruel prison conditions for incarcerated trans individuals and rallied to free CeCe. After serving for 19 months, she was released January 2014.

[[File:Left OUT 04 HRC Betrayed all of us.jpg | thumb|Left OUT Party Two signs summarize the feelings of protestors.]] On March 26–27, 2013, LGBT activists gathered at the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. to support marriage equality, but in the midst of these demonstrations one speaker was asked to edit their proceedings to conceal their trans identity, and the trans community was asked to lower their pride flags. This incident follows years of tension between activist groups, namely [[Human Rights Campaign]] and the trans community, because the trans community is often neglected or blatantly excluded from events and political consideration. The incident resulted in a backlash and public criticism by the trans community. In response, activists groups apologized for the incident, and in 2014 HRC promised to energize efforts for promoting trans rights.

In Florida in March 2015, Representative Frank Artiles (R-Miami) proposed House Bill 583, which would ensure that individuals who enter public facilities such as bathrooms or locker rooms designated for those who are of the "other biological sex" could be jailed for up to 60 days. Artiles claims that it was proposed for the sake of public safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wiesenthal|first1=Nicole|title=Controversial 'bathroom bill' leaves Florida transgender students, allies concerned|url=http://college.usatoday.com/2015/03/20/controversial-bathroom-bill-leaves-florida-transgender-students-allies-concerned/|website=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Representation on the screen ===
Representation in pop culture has major effects on both the [[transgender]] and [[cisgender]] communities. Elizabeth Tisdell and Patricia Thompson conducted a study on the effects of representation in the media on teachers and its effect on the way they teach in the classroom. This study found that when teachers had been exposed to programming that featured diverse characters in a positive light, teachers were more open to teaching their students in a more open, accepting way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tisdell|first=Elizabeth J.|last2=Thompson|first2=Patricia M.|date=2007-11-01|title=‘Seeing from a different angle’: the role of pop culture in teaching for diversity and critical media literacy in adult education|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02601370701711349|journal=International Journal of Lifelong Education|volume=26|issue=6|pages=651–673|doi=10.1080/02601370701711349|issn=0260-1370}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, the authors found that media reinforces the values of the [[dominant culture]], and is one of the most powerful ways to informally educate people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tisdell|first=Elizabeth J.|last2=Thompson|first2=Patricia M.|date=2007-11-01|title=‘Seeing from a different angle’: the role of pop culture in teaching for diversity and critical media literacy in adult education|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02601370701711349|journal=International Journal of Lifelong Education|volume=26|issue=6|pages=651–673|doi=10.1080/02601370701711349|issn=0260-1370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tisdell and Thompson state that this representation is a way in which people construct ideas of themselves and others, and that more representation lends legitimacy to identities and movements such as the transgender movement. 

In a separate study, [[GLAAD]] looked at the representation of transgender characters in the media over the last ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.glaad.org/publications/victims-or-villains-examining-ten-years-transgender-images-television|title=Victims or Villains: Examining Ten Years of Transgender Images on Television|date=2012-11-20|work=GLAAD|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; After examining many different epsiodes and storylines, GLAAD found that [[List of transgender characters in film and television|transgender characters]] were cast in a “victim” role in 40% of the catalogued episodes, and were cast as killers or victims in 21% of the episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.glaad.org/publications/victims-or-villains-examining-ten-years-transgender-images-television|title=Victims or Villains: Examining Ten Years of Transgender Images on Television|date=2012-11-20|work=GLAAD|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also found that the most common profession of transgender characters in the episodes was [[Sex work|sex workers]], seen in about 20% of the episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.glaad.org/publications/victims-or-villains-examining-ten-years-transgender-images-television|title=Victims or Villains: Examining Ten Years of Transgender Images on Television|date=2012-11-20|work=GLAAD|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the representation of transgender characters, the authors found that anti-transgender slurs, language, and dialogue were present in at least 61% of the episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.glaad.org/publications/victims-or-villains-examining-ten-years-transgender-images-television|title=Victims or Villains: Examining Ten Years of Transgender Images on Television|date=2012-11-20|work=GLAAD|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Activism|Activists]] within the transgender rights movement argue that representation such as these set the movement back in gaining understanding within mainstream [[society]]. Jayce Montgomery is a trans man who argues that these types of representation “always displaying [transgender people] in the stereotypical way. You know, “[[Masculinity|masculine]],” [or] this is the man/this is the woman role. And not really delving into their background and what they actually go through.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/post/a-conversation-about-transgender-representation-in-pop-culture|title=A Conversation About Transgender Representation in Pop Culture|work=Bitch Media|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same conversation, Stacey Rice goes on in the same conversation with [[Bitch Media]] to make the point that well known transgender celebrities are not representative of the general transgender community’s experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/post/a-conversation-about-transgender-representation-in-pop-culture|title=A Conversation About Transgender Representation in Pop Culture|work=Bitch Media|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rice then goes on to say that while these celebrities are not representative of the average transgender person's experience, the visibility they bring to the transgender rights movement does nothing but help the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/post/a-conversation-about-transgender-representation-in-pop-culture|title=A Conversation About Transgender Representation in Pop Culture|work=Bitch Media|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
