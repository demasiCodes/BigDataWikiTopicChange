In 1952 Virginia Prince, a male [[crossdresser]], along with others, launched ''Transvestia: The Journal of the American Society for Equality in Dress.''&lt;ref name="glbtq1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/transgender_activism.html |title=&gt;&gt; social sciences &gt;&gt; Transgender Activism |publisher=glbtq |date= |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This publication was the beginning of the transgender rights movement in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="glbtq1"/&gt; In 1969, transgender and [[transsexual]] people played an integral part in the [[Stonewall Riots]], including [[Sylvia Rae Rivera]], a transsexual who was an instigator in the uprising. Rivera continued to be an advocate for transgender rights until her death in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbthistorymonth.com/glbthistorymonth/2006/bio.cfm?LeaderID=4 |title=GLBT History Month |publisher=GLBT History Month |date= |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Stonewall, awareness of transexuality grew considerably. Support groups for male cross-dressers were common in the 1970s and 80s. In the 1980s female to male ([[transman|FTM]]) transsexuality became common.&lt;ref name="glbtq2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/transgender_activism,3.html |title=&gt;&gt; social sciences &gt;&gt; Transgender Activism |publisher=glbtq |date= |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Transsexual people are frequently the victims of [[hate crime]]s. On December 31, 1993, a [[trans man]] [[Brandon Teena]] was murdered in [[Nebraska]] along with two of his friends. This murder was documented in the 1999 movie ''[[Boys Don't Cry (film)|Boys Don't Cry]]'' starring [[Hilary Swank]] as Brandon Teena.&lt;ref name="glbtq2"/&gt; In 2005, the movie ''[[Transamerica (film)|Transamerica]]'' told the story of a male to female transsexual preparing for gender reassignment surgery and traveling across the United States with her bisexual son. The [[Transgender Day of Remembrance]] to commemorate those who lost their lives due to their gender identity was first held in 1999 following the murder of [[Rita Hester]] in 1998. The "Remembering our Dead" web project was also set up in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rememberingourdead.org/day/ |title=Transgender Day of Remembrance |publisher=Rememberingourdead.org |date=2005-11-20 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transfeminism]] is a form of transgender activism, which involves challenging dominant [[feminist]] narratives which typically only describe the experiences of [[cisgender]] women. [[Julia Serano]] is a notable American transgender feminist and [[Diane Marie Rodriguez Zambrano|Diane Rodriguez]] is other Latin American [[Transfeminist]] third-wave.
