[[File:Respect and Equality for All Trans People (4764133272) (2).jpg |thumb|261px|Pride London, 3 July 2010.]] The '''transgender rights movement''' is a movement to promote [[transgender rights]] and to eliminate [[transgender inequality|discrimination]] and [[List of unlawfully killed transgender people|violence]] against [[transgender]] people regarding housing, employment, public accommodations, education, and health care. In some jurisdictions, transgender activism seeks to allow changes to identification documents to conform with a person's current [[gender identity]] without the need for [[sex reassignment surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peraino|first1=Judith|last2=Cusick|first2=Suzanne|title=Music and Sexuality|journal=Journal of the American Musicological Society|volume=66|issue=3|pages=825|jstor=10.1525/jams.2013.66.3.825|doi=10.1525/jams.2013.66.3.825|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Identifying the boundaries of a trans movement has been a matter of some debate. Conventionally, evidence of a codified political identity emerges in 1952, when [[Virginia Prince]], a male [[crossdresser]], along with others, launched ''[[Virginia Prince#Transvestia magazine|Transvestia: The Journal of the American Society for Equality in Dress.]]''&lt;ref name="glbtq1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/transgender_activism.html |title=&gt;&gt; social sciences &gt;&gt; Transgender Activism |publisher=glbtq |accessdate=2009-11-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525105458/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/transgender_activism.html |archivedate=2012-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This publication is considered by some to be the beginning of the transgender rights movement in the [[United States]], however it would be many years before the term "transgender", itself, would come into common usages.&lt;ref name="glbtq1"/&gt;

In the years before the [[Stonewall riots]], [[List of LGBT actions in the United States prior to the Stonewall riots|other actions for LGBT rights had taken place]], but while gender nonconformity has always been a part of signalling gay identity, most of the early gay organizations were more assimilationist in their immediate goals.

An early, but not widely known, action is the [[Cooper Donuts Riot]] of 1959 that took place in Downtown Los Angeles,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gilliland |first=AJ |last2=Caswell |first2=M |date=2016 |title=Records and Their Imaginaries: Imagining the Impossible, Making Possible the Imagined|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7xn3w83m#|journal=Archival Science|volume=16|pages=12–13|via=eScholarship|doi=10.1007/s10502-015-9259-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
when drag queens, lesbians, gay men, and transgender people who hung out at Cooper Do-nuts and who were frequently harassed by the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] fought back after police arrested three people, including [[John Rechy]]. Patrons began pelting the police with donuts and coffee cups. The LAPD called for back-up and arrested a number of rioters. Rechy and the other two original detainees were able to escape.&lt;ref name=Faderman&gt;A[[Lillian Faderman|Faderman, Lillian]] and Stuart Timmons (2006). ''Gay L.A.: A History of Sexual Outlaws, Power Politics, and Lipstick Lesbians''. Basic Books. pp. 1–2. {{ISBN|0-465-02288-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1966 the [[Compton's Cafeteria Riot]] occurred in the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco, California|Tenderloin]] district of [[San Francisco]]. This incident was one of the first recorded [[LGBT]]-related riots in United States history.&lt;ref name=Faderman/&gt; In an incident similar to Cooper's, drag queens, prostitutes and trans people fought back against police harassment. When a transgender woman resisted arrest by throwing coffee at a police officer, drag queens poured into the streets, fighting back with their high heels and heavy bags.&lt;ref name=Stryker&gt;Stryker, Susan. ''Transgender History''. First Printing edition. Berkeley, CA: Seal Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The next night, the regular patrons were joined by [[Male prostitutes|street hustlers]], Tenderloin street people, and other members of the LGBT community in their stand against police violence.&lt;ref name="screaming"&gt;''Screaming Queens: The Riot at Compton's Cafeteria'' (documentary film by Victor Silverman and [[Susan Stryker]], 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; It marked the beginning of trans activism in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="boyd"&gt;Boyd, Nan Alamilla (2004). "San Francisco" in the ''Encyclopedia of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered History in America'', Ed. Marc Stein. Vol. 3. Charles Scribner's Sons. pp. 71–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, the year of the [[Stonewall Riots]], the term transgender was not yet in use. But [[gender nonconforming]] people like drag king [[Stormé DeLarverie]], and self-identified "street queen" [[Marsha P. Johnson]] were in the vanguard of the riots, with DeLarverie widely believed to be the person whose struggle with the police was the spark that set the crowd to fighting back.&lt;ref name="Gremore"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gremore |first=Graham |url=http://www.queerty.com/storme-delarverie-rosa-parks-of-the-gay-rights-movement-dies-at-93-20140527 |title=Stormé DeLarverie, "Rosa Parks" Of The Gay Rights Movement, Dies at 93 |publisher=[[Queerty]] |date=May 27, 2014 |accessdate=March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;Yardley, William (May 29, 2014) "[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/30/nyregion/storme-delarverie-early-leader-in-the-gay-rights-movement-dies-at-93.html?_r=0 Storme DeLarverie, Early Leader in the Gay Rights Movement, Dies at 93]" in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses to the uprising also place early trans activists and members of the [[Gay Liberation Front]], Zazu Nova and Jackie Hormona along with Johnson, as combatants "in the vanguard" of the pushback against the police on the multiple nights of the rebellion.&lt;ref name=CarterVanguard&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter|first=David|title=Stonewall: The Riots that Sparked the Gay Revolution|year=2004|publisher=St. Martin's|pp=61|isbn=0-312-20025-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marsha P. Johnson]] later went on to co-found [[Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries]] (STAR) with close friend [[Sylvia Rivera]]. Rivera's early definitions around trans were very broad, including all gender-nonconforming people.&lt;ref name=TWF&gt;Feinberg, Leslie (1996) ''Transgender Warriors: Making History''. Boston: Beacon Press. {{ISBN|0-8070-7941-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Rivera continued to be an advocate for trans rights, and inclusion of protection for trans people in all LGBT rights legislation, until her death in 2002.&lt;ref name="StonewallMyths"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gaycitynews.nyc/stories/2019/15/david-carter-stonewall-2019-06-27-gcn.html |title=Exploding the Myths of Stonewall |author=Carter, David |date=June 27, 2019 |accessdate=June 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s female to male ([[trans man|FTM]]) transsexuality became more broadly known.&lt;ref name="glbtq2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/transgender_activism,3.html |title=&gt;&gt; social sciences &gt;&gt; Transgender Activism |publisher=glbtq |date= |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 [[Leslie Feinberg]] printed and circulated a pamphlet titled "Transgender Liberation: A Movement Whose Time Has Come". Feinberg's pamphlet begins by calling on the trans community to compose their own definitions, invoking language as a tool that unites people divided by oppression. From here, Feinberg traces the emergence of oppression imposed by the ruling class by means of institutions. These institutions, run by the elite, enforce a gender binary at the expense of communal societies that encouraged liberal gender expression. Women were devalued and effeminacy was disparaged to promote patriarchal economic privilege. According to Feinberg, the [[gender binary]] is a contrivance of Western civilization. Having acknowledged this, Feinberg encourages all humans to reclaim the natural continuum of [[gender expression]] that identifies trans individuals as sacred. Feinberg concludes by empowering the [[working class]] to liberate themselves from the [[ruling class]], which can be achieved by directing the [[wage labor|labor]] of [[marginalized groups]] towards the common goal of revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Feinberg |first1=Leslie |title=Transgender Liberation: A Movement Whose Time Has Come |date=1992 |publisher=World View Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, [[Adela Vázquez]], a Latina transgender woman, protested for in [[San Francisco]] in consideration of the government removing the transgender community from the workforce because they labeled the trans community as disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Finding a Home in Transgender Activism in San Francisco|last=Vázquez|first=Adela|work=Queer Brown Voices: Personal Narratives of Latina/o LGBT Activism|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2015|isbn=|editor-last=Quesada|editor-first=Uriel|location=|pages=216–17|editor-last2=Gomez|editor-first2=Letitia|editor-last3=Vidal-Ortiz|editor-first3=Salvador}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that situation is making some progress and is changing. In 2014, per The Nation Gay and Lesbian Task Force record, only 17 states (and the District of Columbia) in the United States of America have laws that protect individuals in the transgender community, which equals to about 45%. States that present these protections are: [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], [[Hawaii]], [[Illinois]], [[Iowa]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Minnesota]], [[New Jersey]], [[New Mexico]], [[Nevada]], [[Oregon]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Vermont]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transgender Americans and Public Policy|last=Jerkins|first=Andrea|work=Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Civil Right: A Public Policy Agenda for Uniting a Divided America|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC|year=2015|isbn=|editor-last=Swan|editor-first=Wallace|location=|pages=173–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there are organizations that are working to increase the numbers of States having these laws like: The Transgender, Gender Variant and Intersex Justice Project; The Transgender Law Center; and the National Center for Transgender Equality.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On December 31, 1993, a [[trans man]] named [[Brandon Teena]] was murdered in [[Nebraska]] along with two of his friends. This murder was documented in the 1999 movie ''[[Boys Don't Cry (film)|Boys Don't Cry]]'' starring [[Hilary Swank]] as Brandon Teena.&lt;ref name="glbtq2"/&gt;

With the publication of 1996's ''Transgender Warriors'', [[Leslie Feinberg]] brought the word "transgender" more fully into use. Like Rivera, Feinberg also defined "transgender" very broadly, including drag queens and gender nonconforming people from history. A dedicated communist, Feinberg included an analysis that included many who are oppressed by the apparatus of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feinberg|first1=Leslie|title=Transgender Warriors: Making History from Joan of Arc to RuPaul|url=https://archive.org/details/transgenderwarri0000fein|url-access=registration|date=1996|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|page=[https://archive.org/details/transgenderwarri0000fein/page/128 128]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transgender Day of Remembrance]], an annual day of remembrance to commemorate those murdered in transphobic hate crimes, was first held in 1999 following the murder of [[Rita Hester]] in 1998. The "Remembering our Dead" web project was also set up in 1999.

In June 2012 [[CeCe McDonald]] was wrongfully imprisoned for having defended herself against neo-nazi attackers with a pair of scissors, which resulted in the death of one of her assailants. Her story was publicized by a [[GLAAD Media Award]] winning article in [[Ebony.com]]. [[Laverne Cox]], openly trans actress on [[Orange Is the New Black]], launched a campaign to raise consciousness of cruel prison conditions for incarcerated trans individuals and rallied to free CeCe. After serving for 19 months, she was released January 2014.

[[File:Left OUT 04 HRC Betrayed all of us.jpg | thumb|Left OUT Party. Two signs reflecting some of the individuals protesting]] On March 26–27, 2013, LGBT activists gathered at the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. to support marriage equality, but in the midst of these demonstrations one speaker was asked to edit their proceedings to conceal their trans identity, and the trans community was asked to lower their pride flags. This incident follows years of tension between activist groups, namely [[Human Rights Campaign]] and the trans community, because the trans community is often neglected or blatantly excluded from events and political consideration. The incident resulted in a backlash and public criticism by the trans community. In response, activists groups apologized for the incident, and in 2014 HRC promised to energize efforts for promoting trans rights.

In Florida in March 2015, Representative Frank Artiles (R-Miami) proposed House Bill 583, which would ensure that individuals who enter public facilities such as bathrooms or locker rooms designated for those who are of the "other biological sex" could be jailed for up to 60 days. Artiles claims that it was proposed for the sake of public safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wiesenthal|first1=Nicole|title=Controversial 'bathroom bill' leaves Florida transgender students, allies concerned|url=http://college.usatoday.com/2015/03/20/controversial-bathroom-bill-leaves-florida-transgender-students-allies-concerned/|website=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, the Botswana High Court ruled that the refusal of the Registrar of National Registration to change a transgender man's gender marker was "unreasonable and violated his constitutional rights to dignity, privacy, freedom of expression, equal protection of the law, freedom from discrimination and freedom from inhumane and degrading treatment". LGBT activists celebrated the ruling, describing it as a great victory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201710090073.html Botswana: Activists Celebrate Botswana's Transgender Court Victory]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://southernafricalitigationcentre.org/2017/09/29/press-release-botswana-high-court-rules-in-landmark-gender-identity-case/ Press Release: Botswana High Court Rules in Landmark Gender Identity Case]&lt;/ref&gt; At first, the Botswana Government announced it would appeal the ruling, but decided against it in December, supplying the trans man with a new identity document that reflects his gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mambaonline.com/2017/12/06/sweet-closure-botswana-agrees-recognise-trans-man/ “Sweet closure” as Botswana finally agrees to recognise trans man], ''Mambaonline''&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar case, where a transgender woman sought to change her gender marker to female, was heard in December 2017. The High Court ruled that the Government must recognise her gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/botswana-gaborone-transgender-identity-lgbt-rights-legabibo-court-law-a8114991.html |title=Botswana to recognise a transgender woman's identity for first time after historic High Court ruling |publisher=independent.co.uk |date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She dedicated her victory to "every single trans diverse person in Botswana".

=== Public toilet legislation ===
{{main|Bathroom bill}}
In the United States, the "[[bathroom bill]]" issue first came to public attention in 2013 when the Colorado Civil Rights Division ruled in favour of  transgender six-year-old student Coy Mathis' right to use the girls' toilet at her elementary school in [[Fountain, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/18/us/in-colorado-a-legal-dispute-over-transgender-rights.html|title=In Colorado, a Legal Dispute Over Transgender Rights|last=Frosch|first=Dan|date=2013-03-17|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case, along with Mathis and her family, was again brought to public attention with the 2016 release of the documentary ''[[Growing Up Coy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/07/movies/growing-up-coy-transgender-documentary.html|title='Growing Up Coy' Explores the Fallout After a Family Fought for Its Transgender Child|last=Buckley|first=Cara|date=2016-06-06|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the Mathis case, numerous states have put forth or passed legislation which obligates transgender people to use the public bathroom corresponding to their [[sex assignment|sex as assigned at birth]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/-bathroom-bill-legislative-tracking635951130.aspx|title="Bathroom Bill" Legislative Tracking|last=Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|website=www.ncsl.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2017, sixteen states had considered such bills and one state, [[North Carolina]], passed its bill into law. The North Carolina House Bill 2, or [[North Carolina House Bill 2|HB2]], was passed into law in February 2017.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; HB2 quickly garnered attention as the first law of its kind and sparked high-profile condemnation, including cancellations of concerts and sporting events by the likes of [[Bruce Springsteen]] and the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/19/the-tumultuous-recent-history-of-north-carolinas-bathroom-bill-which-could-be-repealed/|title=Analysis {{!}} The tumultuous history of North Carolina's bathroom bill, which is on its way to repeal|last=Phillips|first=Amber|date=2017-03-30|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the midst of the controversy and the inauguration of a new governor of North Carolina, the bill was repealed by the state legislature on March 30 of 2017.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Education ===
The treatment of transgender people in educational environments has often been a focal point of the movement's concern. In a survey of Canadian high schools conducted between 2007 and 2009, 74% of students who identified themselves as trans reported having experienced verbal harassment over their gender expression, 37% reported physical harassment over their gender expression, and 49% of trans students reported at least one instance of sexual harassment within the last school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mygsa.ca/setting-gsa/homophobia-transphobia-statistics|title=Homophobia and Transphobia Statistics {{!}} MyGSA|website=mygsa.ca|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Smith College]], an all women liberal arts US college gained notoriety for denying admission to Calliope Wong, a transgender female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/opinion/transgender-students-at-womens-colleges.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Transgender Students at Women's Colleges|last=Board|first=The Editorial|date=2015-05-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the incident, the college’s administration and student activists engaged in a protracted battle around transgender women’s rights. The first women’s college in the United States to open admission to transgender women was [https://www.mills.edu/admission-aid/undergraduate-admissions/how-to-apply/transgender-admission-policy.php Mills] in the year of 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mills.edu/admission-aid/undergraduate-admissions/how-to-apply/transgender-admission-policy.php|title=Transgender Admission Policy {{!}} Mills College|website=www.mills.edu|access-date=2019-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed closely behind by [[Mount Holyoke College|Mount Holyoke]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mount-holyoke-transgender-policy_n_5760952|title=All-Women's College Changes Policy To Welcome Genderqueer, Transgender Students|last=Mosbergen|first=Dominique|date=2014-09-03|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=2019-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Mills and Mount Holyoke, [[Simmons University]], [[Scripps College]], [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]] and [[Wellesley College|Wellesley]] changed their policy to accept transgender students. The last US women colleges to change their policies to admit transgender students were [[Smith College]] and [[Barnard College]], effective on May and June 2015, respectively.&lt;ref name="Weber 29–45"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weber|first=Shannon|date=2016-01-02|title="Womanhood does not reside in documentation": Queer and feminist student activism for transgender women's inclusion at women's colleges|journal=Journal of Lesbian Studies|volume=20|issue=1|pages=29–45|doi=10.1080/10894160.2015.1076238|issn=1089-4160|pmid=26701768}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student activists at US women colleges are credited for the introduction of more inclusionary policies allowing admission of trans women in spaces which historically have excluded them. [[Mount Holyoke College|Mount Holyoke]] remains the most gender-inclusive, admitting not only transgender women but also transgender men and non-binary people under its all-persons-but-cisgender-men policy.&lt;ref name="Weber 29–45"/&gt;

===Statistics of oppression===
{{More|Transgender inequality}}
In a survey conducted by [[National Center for Transgender Equality]] and the [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]], called "Injustice at Every Turn: A Report of the National Transgender Discrimination Survey", respondents reported that 90% of them had experienced discrimination and harassment in the work place and at school. The trans community experiences rates of unemployment that are double the national average. Additionally, one out of every twelve trans women, and one out of every eight trans women of color, are physically attacked or assaulted in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grant|first1=Jaime M.|last2=Mottet|first2=Lisa A.|last3=Tanis|first3=Justin|last4=Harrison|first4=Jack|last5=Herman|first5=Jody L.|last6=Keisling|first6=Mara|title=Injustice at Every Turn: A Report of the National Transgender Discrimination Survey|url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf|publisher=National Center for Transgender Equality and National Gay and Lesbian Task Force |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140731002006/https://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf |archive-date=February 9, 2011 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2019}}

===Health care===
Every major medical association in the United States recognizes the medical necessity of transition-related care for improving the physical and mental health of transgender people and has called for health insurance coverage for treatment of gender dysphoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date = March 26, 2020|title = Health insurance coverage for gender-affirming care of transgender patients|website = American Medical Association|url = https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/2019-03/transgender-coverage-issue-brief.pdf|accessdate = July 31, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===People of color===

'''Transgender people of color''' often face an identity that is under speculation, suspicion, doubt, and policing. Those within the trans community are often left out from the wealthy, able-bodied, American, and white experience that those in the non-trans community often focus on, and are subject to discrimination as a transgender person and as a person of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What trans people of color fear after the Bruce Jenner media circus|url = http://fusion.net/story/125983/what-trans-people-of-color-fear-after-bruce-jenner-media-circus/|website = Fusion|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, this is in part due to the rejection of an individual by family members at a young age. "The majority of transgender women of color", say Juline A. Koken, David S. Bimbi, and Jeffrey T. Parsons, "experience verbal and physical abuse at the hands of their family members upon disclosing their transgender identity."&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;Juline A. Koken, David S. Bimbi, and Jeffrey T. Parsons, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2840628/, "Experiences of Familial Acceptance – Rejection among Transwomen of Color.], ''Journal of Family Psychology'', 2009. Retrieved 2017-11-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

As transgender women of color face both gender and racial discrimination, their experiences may be qualitatively different from white transgender women. African-American and Latino families are deeply rooted in religious tradition, which may lead to more socially conservative and rigid ideas about gender roles, homosexuality, and traditionalism, and many transgender women of color state that their parents' negative reactions are largely due to the role religious beliefs play on their lives. In addition, parents also worry that their children will face additional hardships as members of [[double minorities]].&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

Some of the ways white transgender people [[white privilege|have more privilege]] than those of their non-white counterparts include racialized violence, better pay, better representation and benefits from the mainstream media movement. According to a National Transgender Discrimination survey, the combination of anti-transgender bias and individual racism results in transgender people of color being 6 times more likely to experience physical violence when interacting with the police compared to cisgender White people, two-thirds of LGBT homicide victims being transgender women of color, and a startling 78% attempt suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 5 Ways White Transgender People Have Privilege Over Transgender People of Color|url = https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/06/transgender-women-disproportionately-targeted-violent-hate-crimes|website = BGD|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bustle|url = http://www.bustle.com/articles/87452-5-shocking-facts-about-transgender-suicide-and-violence-that-you-need-to-know|website = www.bustle.com|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 17 homicides of trans and gender-nonconforming people in 2017 that the project has counted so far, 16 had been people of color; 15 had been transgender women; and 13 had been black transgender women.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Waters and Sue Yacka-Bible, [http://avp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/NCAVP-A-Crisis-of-Hate-Final.pdf, "“A Crisis of Hate: A Mid Year Report on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Hate Violence Homicides"], ''National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs''. Retrieved 2017-11-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs|NCAVP]] survey also found that trans survivors were 1.7 times more likely to be the victims of sexual violence than cis-gender survivors. Transgender/non-conforming individuals also reported over four times the national average of HIV infection (0.6% compared to 2.64%, respectively) with rates for transgender women (3.76%) and those who are unemployed (4.67%) even higher.&lt;ref name="nursingstudentsforsexualandreproductivehealth.org"&gt;Jaime Grant et. al, [http://nursingstudentsforsexualandreproductivehealth.org/resources/Pictures/Trans-Health-Supplements.pdf, "National Transgender Discrimination Survey Report on Health and Health Care", ''National Center for Transgender Equality''.

The pure social stigma of being transgender is a root cause for poor health care, which manifests into other areas of transgender people. Social determinants of health, including violence and discrimination, may result in negative personal psychological and physiological effects. The access to proper health care is essential in both the transitioning and resilience. In a study of resilience of transgender people of color, Jay, a 41-year-old FTM POC, stated he “had no place to turn to get help in transition—and worked five jobs trying to save money for surgery that [he] never knew if [he] would be able to afford.”&lt;ref name="journals.sagepub.com"&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1534765610369261, | doi=10.1177/1534765610369261| title="Just getting out of bed is a revolutionary act": The resilience of transgender people of color who have survived traumatic life events| journal=Traumatology| volume=17| issue=2| pages=34–44| year=2011| last1=Singh| first1=Anneliese A.| last2=McKleroy| first2=Vel S.| citeseerx=10.1.1.1017.9594}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another key factor to the resilience to opposition of transgender POC involved having a strong sense of pride in both ethnic and gender identities. Developing this sense of pride can be a process, which involves overcoming barriers such as transphobia and racism. However, once these barriers are in fact crossed, transgender POC can start to see themselves in a better light and use their inner strength and confidence to be more persistent, optimistic, and positivity-oriented.

In recent years, there have been several housing crises among transgender people, especially transgender people of color. According to a 2016 Gallup poll, 10.052 million people in the United States identify as lesbian, gay, or transgender, and millennials, or those born between 1980 and 1998, drive virtually all of all of the increases overall LGBT self-identification.&lt;ref&gt;Gary J. Gates, [http://news.gallup.com/poll/201731/lgbt-identification-rises.aspx, "In U.S., More Adults Identifying as LGBT"], ''Gallup News'', 2017. Retrieved 2017-11-15.&lt;/ref&gt; As the millennial generation has entered the college age, trans individuals have seen difficulty in securing basic housing rights and needs. There is a definite predominance of sex-segregated bathrooms, locker rooms, and housing where transgender people regularly are denied access, and are harassed and challenged for their gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/10538720.2014.891091|title = Transgender Individuals' Access to College Housing and Bathrooms: Findings from the National Transgender Discrimination Survey| journal=Journal of Gay &amp; Lesbian Social Services| volume=26| issue=2| pages=186–206|year = 2014|last1 = Seelman|first1 = Kristie L.|url = https://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1058&amp;context=ssw_facpub}}&lt;/ref&gt;] Most of the time, they are forced to “pick” a gender, even though they do not necessarily identify with it. Most universities operate on the premise that gender is binary and static, and this can be especially problematic with either poorer transgender individuals or transgender people of color, since 55% of college students in the United States are white&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postsecondary.gatesfoundation.org/areas-of-focus/incentives/policy-advocacy/advocacy-priorities/america-100-college-students/], "Today’s College Students Infographic"], ''Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation – Postsecondary Success'', 2017.

Retrieved 2017-11-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Poverty ====
Black transgender people live in extreme poverty with 34% reporting a household income of less than $10,000 a year, which is more than twice the rate for transgender people of all races (15%), four times the black population (9%), and eight times the U.S. population (4%).&lt;ref name="David Elias Weekley 2017" /&gt; Transgender people of color are more likely to be poor, be homeless, or lack a college degree.&lt;ref name="BGD" /&gt; Multiple factors pile up on each other that force many transgender people of color to be homeless; for instance, many individuals are involved in abusive relationships or live in crime-ridden neighborhoods because of the difficulty finding employment as a transgender person and/or experiencing job loss due to transphobia in the work place.&lt;ref name="journals.sagepub.com" /&gt; Those with greater socioeconomic status might use their social connections to advocate for access to appropriate housing for transgender students in ways that are not possible for most lower-income families; one proposal comes from the Administration for Children and Families, which issued the largest-ever LGBT focused federal grant to develop a model program to support LGBT foster youth and prevent them from being homeless.&lt;ref&gt;[https://transequality.org/issues/housing-homelessness, "Issues | Housing &amp; Homelessness"], ''National Center for Transgender Equality'', 2017. Retrieved 2017-11-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Intersectionality ====
Trans communities also experience problems with intersectionality when it comes to traditional male and female gender roles. The experiences trans men face are vastly different than those of trans women; trans men who were raised as female were treated differently as soon as they came out as male. They gained professional experience, but lost intimacy; exuded authority, but caused fear.&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;Charlotte Alter, [http://time.com/transgender-men-sexism/, "Transgender Men See Sexism From Both Sides"], ''Time''. Retrieved 2017-11-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural sexism is often more visible to trans men because it is easier to be “low-disclosure” than trans women.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt; They are usually not recognized as trans, which is known as passing, and it avoids transphobia and discrimination by others. “Women’s appearances get more attention,” says [[Julia Serano]], a transgender activist, “and women’s actions are commented on and critiqued more than men, so [it] just makes sense that people will focus more on trans women than trans men.”&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;

The focus of the realms of trans visibility in pop culture and trans organizations has mostly been on white people, especially with [[Caitlyn Jenner]] joining the trans community.&lt;ref name="BGD"&gt;{{Cite web|title = 5 Ways White Transgender People Have Privilege Over Transgender People of Color|url = http://www.blackgirldangerous.org/2015/07/5-ways-white-transgender-people-have-privilege-over-transgender-people-of-color/|website = BGD|accessdate = 2015-11-25|date = 2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Representation in media ===
Representation in pop culture has major effects on both the [[transgender]] and [[cisgender]] communities. Elizabeth Tisdell and Patricia Thompson conducted a study on the effects of representation in the media on teachers and its effect on the way they teach in the classroom. This study found that when teachers had been exposed to programming that featured diverse characters in a positive light, teachers were more open to teaching their students in a more open, accepting way.&lt;ref name="Tisdell 651–673"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tisdell|first=Elizabeth J.|last2=Thompson|first2=Patricia M.|date=2007-11-01|title='Seeing from a different angle': the role of pop culture in teaching for diversity and critical media literacy in adult education|journal=International Journal of Lifelong Education|volume=26|issue=6|pages=651–673|doi=10.1080/02601370701711349|issn=0260-1370}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, the authors found that media reinforces the values of the [[dominant culture]], and is one of the most powerful ways to informally educate people.&lt;ref name="Tisdell 651–673"/&gt; Tisdell and Thompson state that this representation is a way in which people construct ideas of themselves and others, and that more representation lends legitimacy to identities and movements such as the transgender movement.

In a separate study, [[GLAAD]] looked at the representation of transgender characters in the media over the last ten years.&lt;ref name="GLAAD"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.glaad.org/publications/victims-or-villains-examining-ten-years-transgender-images-television|title=Victims or Villains: Examining Ten Years of Transgender Images on Television|date=2012-11-20|work=GLAAD|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; After examining many different episodes and storylines, GLAAD found that [[List of transgender characters in film and television|transgender characters]] were cast in a “victim” role in 40% of the catalogued episodes, and were cast as killers or victims in 21% of the episodes.&lt;ref name="GLAAD"/&gt; They also found that the most common profession of transgender characters in the episodes was [[sex work]]ers, seen in about 20% of the episodes.&lt;ref name="GLAAD"/&gt; In addition to the representation of transgender characters, the authors found that anti-transgender slurs, language, and dialogue were present in at least 61% of the episodes.&lt;ref name="GLAAD"/&gt;

[[Activism|Activists]] within the transgender rights movement argue that representation such as these set the movement back in gaining understanding within mainstream [[society]]. Jayce Montgomery is a trans man who argues that these types of representation “always displaying [transgender people] in the stereotypical way. You know, “[[Masculinity|masculine]],” [or] this is the man/this is the woman role. And not really delving into their background and what they actually go through.”&lt;ref name="Bitch Media"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/post/a-conversation-about-transgender-representation-in-pop-culture|title=A Conversation About Transgender Representation in Pop Culture|work=Bitch Media|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same conversation, Stacey Rice goes on in the same conversation with [[Bitch Media]] to make the point that well known transgender celebrities are not representative of the general transgender community’s experiences.&lt;ref name="Bitch Media"/&gt; Rice then goes on to say that while these celebrities are not representative of the average transgender person's experience, the visibility they bring to the transgender rights movement does nothing but help the cause.&lt;ref name="Bitch Media"/&gt;

Many celebrities have spoken out in support of transgender rights and often in conjunction with overall support for the LGBTQ community. Numerous celebrities voice such support for the Human Rights Campaign, including Archie Panjabi, Lance Bass, Tituss Burgess, Chelsea Clinton, George Clooney, Tim Cook, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Sally Field, Lady Gaga, Whoopi Goldberg, Anne Hathaway, Jennifer Hudson, Caitlyn Jenner, Jazz Jennings, Elton John, Cyndi Lauper, Jennifer Lopez, Demi Lovato, Natasha Lyonne, Ellen Page, Brad Pitt, Geena Rocero, Bruce Springsteen, Jeffrey Tambor, Charlize Theron, Miley Cyrus, and Lana Wachowski.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/hrc-story/celebrity-supporters|title=Celebrity Supporters {{!}} Human Rights Campaign|last=Campaign|first=Human Rights|website=Human Rights Campaign|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.looktothestars.org/charity/human-rights-campaign|title=Human Rights Campaign: Celebrity Supporters|website=Look to the Stars|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/blog/watch-49-celebrities-honor-49-victims-of-orlando-tragedy-in-new-ryan-murphy|title=49 Celebrities Honor 49 Victims of Orlando Tragedy {{!}} Human Rights Campaign|last=Campaign|first=Human Rights|website=Human Rights Campaign|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/resources/celebrities-come-out-for-equality-in-2015|title=Celebrities Come Out for Equality in 2015 {{!}} Human Rights Campaign|last=Campaign|first=Human Rights|website=Human Rights Campaign|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Magnus Hirschfeld]], a German physician and outspoken advocate for sexual minorities, probably did more than anyone else for half a century to support transgender people and their rights to live a normal life in their identity.

In the same vein, [[Harry Benjamin]] German-American sexologist, author of ''[[The Transsexual Phenomenon]]'' was a  supporter of transgender rights and helped establish the medical procedures and [[Standards of Care]] for transgender persons in the United States.
