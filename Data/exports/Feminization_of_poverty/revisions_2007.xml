In 2000, 11% of all families in the United States lived in poverty, but 28% of families headed by [[single mother]]s did so.&lt;ref&gt;Dalaker. 2001. ''Poverty in the United States: 2000''.

Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt;  The burden of supporting a family is difficult for single mothers because of low salaries relating to the lack of previous work experience and low educational attainment and is often exacerbated by meager or unavailable [[child support]]s.   In the United States, divorce is a primary factor leading to the filing for economic [[bankruptcy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=Race and Ethnicity: Critical Concepts in Sociology |author=Harry Goulbourne|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|id=ISBN 0415224993|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=B3hZaJ1erY4C&amp;pg=PA193&amp;sig=MUShhbb6sHDShecAY2kOmFGAkNc|pages=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;
