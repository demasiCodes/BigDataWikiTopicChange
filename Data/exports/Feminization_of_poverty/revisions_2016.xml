In 1978, Diana Pearce coined the term, "the feminization of poverty" after doing much research and seeing how many women struggled with [[poverty in the United States|poverty within the United States]], as well as globally.  According to Pearce's research, two-thirds of the poor who were over age 16 were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Pearce | first = Diana | title = The feminization of poverty: women, work, and welfare | journal = Urban and Social Change Review, special issue, Women and Work | volume = 11 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 28–36 | publisher = [[Boston College]] | date = 1978 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://socialworkers.org/feminizationofpoverty/presentations/pearce/Pearce_The%20Feminization%20of%20Poverty_1978%20original%20article.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

Several factors affect the feminization of poverty, and these factors place women at high risk of poverty. Though low income is the major cause, there are many interrelated facets of this problem. Lone mothers are usually at the highest risk for extreme poverty because their income is insufficient to rear children. It then lowers their children's possibilities for good education and nourishment. Low income is a consequence of the social bias women face in trying to obtain [[informal sector|formal employment]], which in turn deepens the [[cycle of poverty]]. As the number of women in poverty increases, the diverse causes affecting their poverty must be examined.&lt;ref name="ARS"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bianchi | first = Suzanne M. | authorlink = Suzanne M. Bianchi | title = Feminization and juvenilization of poverty: trends, relative risks, causes, and consequences | journal = [[Annual Review of Sociology]] | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 307–333 | publisher = [[Annual Reviews]] | doi = 10.1146/annurev.soc.25.1.307 | date = August 1999 | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.25.1.307 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poverty is multidimensional, and therefore economic, demographic, and socio-cultural factors all overlap and contribute to the establishment of poverty.&lt;ref name="Morocco"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Skalli | first = Loubna H. | title = Women and poverty in Morocco: the many faces of social exclusion | journal = [[Feminist Review]] | publisher = [[Palgrave Macmillan]] | date = November 2001 | volume = 69 | issue = 1 | pages = 73–89 |doi = 10.1080/014177800110070120 | url= http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/014177800110070120 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}{{Paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a phenomenon with multiple root causes and manifestations.&lt;ref name="Morocco"/&gt;

===Disparate income===
{{further information|Gender pay gap}}
Lack of income is a principal reason for women's risk of poverty.  Income deprivation prevents women from attaining resources and converting their monetary resources into socioeconomic status. Not only does higher income allow greater access to job skills; obtaining more job skills raises income as well.  As women earn less income than men, they are deprived of basic education and health care, which eventually becomes a cycle to debilitate women's ability to earn higher income.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Amartya. "Poverty as Capability Deprivation." Development as Freedom. 1999. 87–110. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deprivation passes down from one generation of women to the next, leading to a perpetual feminization of poverty.  The main reason behind this cycle of poverty is the lower earnings of women, due to having to care for their offspring.  In many places,{{Where|date=April 2016}} persistent gender discrimination in the work force does not allow the majority of women quality work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buvinić|first=Mayra|title=Women in Poverty: A New Global Underclass|journal=Foreign Policy|date=September 1997|issue=108|jstor=1149088 |pages=38–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Single mother households===

Single mother households are critical in addressing feminization of poverty and can be broadly defined as households in which there are female headships and no male headships. Single mother households are at the highest risk of [[poverty]] for women due to lack of [[Income]] and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00220380701611477 |title=Poverty and productivity in female-headed households in Zimbabwe |year=2007 |last1=Horrell |first1=Sara |last2=Krishnan |first2=Pramila |journal=Journal of Development Studies |volume=43 |issue=8 |pages=1351–80|url=http://econpapers.repec.org/article/tafjdevst/v_3a43_3ay_3a2007_3ai_3a8_3ap_3a1351-1380.htm}}{{Paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a continuing increase of single mother households in the world, which results in higher percentages of women in poverty.&lt;ref name=Sylvia2006/&gt; Single mothers are the poorest women in society, and their children tend to be disadvantaged in comparison to their peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10834-010-9198-z |title=Labor Force Participation, Regional Location, and Economic Well-Being of Single Mothers in Russia |year=2010 |last1=Kanji |first1=Shireen |journal=Journal of Family and Economic Issues |volume=32 |pages=62–72 |url=http://econpapers.repec.org/article/kapjfamec/v_3a32_3ay_3a2011_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a62-72.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different factors can be taken into account for the rise in the number of female headship in households. When men become [[migrant workers]], women are left to be the main caretaker of their homes. Other factors such as illnesses and deaths of husbands lead to an increase in single mother households in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref name="BrennerJohanna"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/089124387001004007 |jstor=189637 |title=Feminist Political Discourses: Radical Versus Liberal Approaches to the Feminization of Poverty and Comparable Worth |year=1987 |last1=Brenner |first1=J. |journal=Gender &amp; Society |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=447–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female headed households are most susceptible to poverty because they have fewer income earners to provide financial support within the household.&lt;ref name="BrennerJohanna" /&gt; According to a case study in Zimbabwe, households headed by widows have an income of approximately half that of male-headed households, and [[de facto]] female headed households have about three quarters of the income of male headed households.&lt;ref name="BrennerJohanna" /&gt; Additionally, single mother households lack critical resources in life, which worsens their state of poverty.&lt;ref name="FukudaParrSakiko" /&gt; They do not have access to the opportunities to attain a decent standard of living along with basic needs such as health and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1300/J013v17n01_02 |title=Double Victims: Poor Women and AIDS |year=1991 |last1=Shayne |first1=Vivian |last2=Kaplan |first2=Barbara |journal=Women &amp; Health |volume=17 |pages=21–37 |issue=1 |pmid=2048320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Single mother households relate to gender inequality issues as women are more susceptible to poverty and lack essential life needs in comparison to men.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Social and cultural exclusions===

Poverty cannot be defined only by statistics and reports, such as the [[poverty line]], to see whether or not people are impoverished in their respective countries.&lt;ref name="Morocco"/&gt; The concept of social and cultural exclusion helps to better convey poverty as a process that involves multiple agents.&lt;ref name="Morocco"/&gt; Many developing countries have social and cultural norms that prevent women from having access to formal employment.&lt;ref name="Missing"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sen|first=Amartya|title=More Than 100 Million Women Are Missing|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1990/dec/20/more-than-100-million-women-are-missing/?pagination=false|newspaper=The New York Review of Books|date=December 20, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in parts of Asia, North Africa, and Latin America, the cultural and social norms do not allow women to have much labor productivity outside the home as well as an economic bargaining position within the household.&lt;ref name="Missing"/&gt; This social inequality deprives women of capabilities, particularly employment, which leads to women having a higher risk of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Amartya. 1999. ''Development as Freedom''. Assignment: Chapter 4, "Poverty as Capability Deprivation", 87–110. 314–19.&lt;/ref&gt; This increase in occupational [[gender segregation]] and widening of the [[gender wage gap]] increases women's susceptibility to poverty.&lt;ref name="ARS"/&gt;

==Measures of poverty==
An important aspect of analyzing the feminization of poverty is understanding how it is measured. It is inaccurate to assume that income is the only deprivation that affects women's poverty, and to examine this issue from a multidimensional perspective there must first be accurate research and indices available for policy makers interested in gender empowerment.&lt;ref name="FukudaParrSakiko" /&gt; Often aggregate indices are criticized for their concentration on monetary issues, especially when data on women's income is sparse, and grouping women into one large, undifferentiated mass.&lt;ref name=Sylvia2006/&gt; Three indexes often examined are [[Gender-related Development Index]], [[Gender Empowerment Measure]], and [[Human Poverty Index]]. The first two are gendered- indices, in that they specifically gather data on women to evaluate gender inequalities,&lt;ref name="FukudaParrSakiko" /&gt; and are useful in understanding disparities in gender opportunities and choices.&lt;ref name="FukudaParrSakiko" /&gt; [[Human Poverty Index|HPI]], however, focuses on deprivation measures rather than income measures.&lt;ref name="FukudaParrSakiko" /&gt;
[[Gender-related Development Index|GDI]] adjusts the [[Human Development Index]] in three ways:
*	Shows longevity, or life-expectancy of females and males
*	Education or knowledge
*	Decent standard of living&lt;ref name=Sylvia2006/&gt;
The aim of this index is to rank countries according to both their absolute level of human development and relative scores on gender equality. Although this index has increased government attention to gender inequality and development, its three measures have often been criticized as neglecting important aspects. Its relevance, however, continues to be integral to the understanding of the feminization of poverty, as countries with lower scores may then be then stimulated to focus on policies to assess and reduce gender disparities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13545700050076106 |title=Measuring socio-economic GENDER inequality: toward an alternative to the UNDP Gender-Related Development Index |date = January 2000 |last1=Dijkstra |first1=A. Geske |last2=Hanmer |first2=Lucia |journal= [[Feminist Economics (journal)|Feminist Economics]] |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=41–75 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13545700050076106 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gender Empowerment Measure|GEM]] measures female political and income opportunities through:
*	Analyzing how many seats of government are occupied by women
*	Proportion of management positions occupied by women
*	Female share of jobs
*	Estimated female to male income ratio&lt;ref name=Sylvia2006/&gt;
HPI is a multidimensional, non-income based approach. It takes into consideration four dimensions:
*	Survival
*	Knowledge
*	Decent standard of living
*	Social participation
This index is useful in understanding and illuminating the differences between human poverty (which focuses on the denial of basic rights, such as dignity and freedom) and income poverty. For example, despite the U.S.'s high income stability, it is also ranked among the highest developed nations in human poverty.&lt;ref name="FukudaParrSakiko" /&gt; In her article, "Towards a Gendered Human Poverty Measure", Elizabeth Durbin critiques HPI and expands on the possibility of a gender-sensitive index. She argues that HPI incorporates three dimensions of poverty: life span measured by the proportion of the population expected to die before age 40, lack of knowledge measured by the proportion who are illiterate, and a decent standard of living measured by a composite index of access to health services, access to safe water, and malnutrition among children less than 5, that could specifically account for gender disparities. Despite its uses, however, it is important to note that HPI cannot be a true measure of poverty because it fails to examine certain deprivations, such as lack of property ownership and credit, that are essential to a stronger bargaining position in the household for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Durbin |first1=Elizabeth |date= January 1999 |title=Towards a gendered human poverty measure |journal=[[Feminist Economics (journal)|Feminist Economics]] |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=105–108 |doi=10.1080/135457099338003|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/135457099338003| publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multidimensional approach==
The feminization of poverty is analysed from a multidimensional perspective, to understand different facets of gender inequality, and investigate potential solutions.&lt;ref name=sen2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sen |first1=Amartya |title=Many Faces of Gender Inequality |journal=Frontline |year=2001 |volume=18 |issue=22 |url=http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1822/18220040.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804035801/http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1822/18220040.htm |archivedate=4 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[capability approach]] studies different aspects of poverty that can enable people, to become agents in their own lives.&lt;ref name=sen2001/&gt;  Studies are also made of opportunities and personal choices available to women.&lt;ref name="FukudaParrSakiko" /&gt;

===Health===
{{See also|Social determinants of health}}

Women in poverty have reduced access to health care services and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bern-Klug | first1 = Mercedes | last2 = Barnes | first2 = Nancy D. | title = Income characteristics of rural older women and implications for health status | journal = [[Journal of Women &amp; Aging]] | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–37 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1300/J074v11n01_03 | pmid = 10323044 | date = January 1999 | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J074v11n01_03 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}{{Paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender inequality in society prevents women from utilizing care services and therefore puts women at risk of poor health.

===Education===
The education of women and children, especially girls, can create greater opportunities for women to lift themselves out of poverty and increase their social position.&lt;ref name=sen2001/&gt;  Countries with strong gender discrimination and social hierarchies limit women's access to basic education.  Even within the household, girls' education is often sacrificed to allow male siblings to attend school.&lt;ref name="VaughanRosie"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vaughan |first1=Rosie Peppin |year=2010 |title=Girls' and women's education within Unesco and the World Bank, 1945–2000 |journal=Compare |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=405–23 |doi=10.1080/03057925.2010.490360 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ891592&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ891592}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important aspect of capabilities is the freedom to make informed choices and have opportunities to achieve goals, and a basic requirement to actively use resources and information is basic education.&lt;ref name="VaughanRosie" /&gt; This enables not only women to reduce household poverty,&lt;ref name="VaughanRosie" /&gt; but as well increases children's chances of education,&lt;ref name="Equalityin"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Equality in Employment |title=The State of the World's Children 2007 |year=2007 |pages=37–49 |publisher=UNICEF |isbn=978-92-806-3998-8 |url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc07/docs/sowc07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enhances maternal health and freedom of movement.&lt;ref name="Equalityin" /&gt;

===Decision-making power===
Decision-making power is central to the bargaining position of women within the household. It is how women and men make decisions that affect the entire household unit. However, women and men often have very different priorities when it comes to determining what is most important for the family.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}  Factors that determine which member of the household has the most power in decision-making vary across cultures, but in most countries{{which|date=April 2016}} there is extreme gender inequality.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}  Men of the household usually{{Clarify|date=April 2016}} have the power to determine what choices are made towards women's health, their ability to visit friends and family, and household expenditures.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}  The ability to make choices for their own health affects both women and children's health.  How household expenditures are decided affects women and children's education, health, and well-being.  Women's freedom of mobility affects their ability to provide for their own needs as well as for the needs of their children.

Gender discrimination within households is often rooted in patriarchal biases against the social status of women.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}  Major determinants of the household bargaining power include control of income and assets, age, and access to and level of education. As women's decision-making power increases, the welfare of their children and the family in general benefits. Women who achieve greater education are also more likely to worry about their children's survival, nutrition, and school attendance.&lt;ref name="UNICEF"&gt;UNICEF. "Women and Children: The Double Dividend of Gender Equality." The State of the World's Children (2007): 1–148. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of dual-income couples in Spain have found that many decisions are contingent on social norms, and not all decisions are negotiated or decided by consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dema-Moreno|first=Sandra|title=Behind the negotiations: Financial decision-making processes in Spanish dual-income couples|journal=Feminist Economics|date=1 January 2009|volume=15|issue=1|pages=27–56|doi=10.1080/13545700802620575|url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/taf/femeco/v15y2009i1p27-56.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there has been major growth in women's employment, the quality of the jobs still remains deeply unequal.&lt;ref name="UNICEF"/&gt;

There are two kinds of employment: Formal and Informal. Formal employment is government regulated and workers are insured a wage and certain rights. Informal employment takes place in small, unregistered enterprises. It is generally a large source of employment for women.&lt;ref name="UNICEF"/&gt; The burden of informal care work falls predominantly on women, who work longer and harder in this role than men. This affects their ability to hold other jobs and change positions, the hours they can work, and their decision to give up work. However, women who have University degrees or other forms of higher learning tend to stay in their jobs even with caring responsibilities, which suggests that the human capital from this experience causes women to feel opportunity costs when they lose their employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carmichael | first1 = Fiona | last2 = Hulme | first2 = Claire | last3 = Sheppard | first3 = Sally | last4 = Connell | first4 = Gemma |title=Work-life imbalance: informal care and paid employment in the UK | journal = [[Feminist Economics (journal)|Feminist Economics]] | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | date = April 2008 | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 3–35 | doi = 10.1080/13545700701881005 | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13545700701881005 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having children has also historically affected women's choice to stay employed. While this "child-effect" has significantly decreased since the 1970s, women's employment is currently decreasing. This has less to do with child-rearing and more with a poor job market for all women, mothers and non-mothers alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boushey | first = Heather | author-link = Heather Boushey | title = "Opting out?"

==Racialization==

Minority women in the United States, specifically Black and Latina women are twice as likely as white women to be living in poverty.&lt;ref name="Poverty 1983"&gt;(The Racial Feminization of Poverty, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family structure===
More women are living in poverty due to changes in the traditional family structure. The increase in divorce rates and single parenthood are two major contributing factors to change in the family structure. Female-headed families have the poorest economic outcomes, with economic well-being dependent on the mother’s marital status and race/ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;(Race, Residence and Family Structure, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; White women generally have access to other income, through marriage or relationships with the highest income earners: white men.&lt;ref name="Poverty 1983"/&gt; Whereas black women, in comparison to white women, are less likely to have white men as partners, and tend to have partners who earn less than white males, even when equally employed.&lt;ref name="Poverty 1983"/&gt; The absence of second income-earning adults is what, in some cases,impedes the well-being of minority women and children.&lt;ref name="United States 1994"&gt;(The Feminization of Poverty in the United States, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Education is considered a contributing factor to why women are more likely than men to live in poverty. 63% of female households who have children under the age of 18 do not complete high school.&lt;ref&gt;The Feminization of Poverty in the United States, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; However, for minority women, socioeconomic factors contribute to them receiving less of an education than whites. There is a high concentration of minorities in poverty living in urban areas; this contributes to poor quality of education as there is a lack of funding in inner-city schools.&lt;ref name="United States 1994"/&gt;

===Access to higher paying jobs===
Residential segregation by race and economic class prevent low-skilled workers, especially minorities, from moving closer to suburban jobs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;("Proximity and Opportunity", 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Female minority householders are twice as likely as their white counterparts to live in central cities.&lt;ref name="United States 1994"/&gt; As more businesses have retreated to suburban areas, the inner-city, where most low-income minorities reside, often face a decline in employment opportunities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Case studies==

Many developing countries in the world are exemplars of the feminization of poverty. Many countries in Asia, Africa, and parts of Europe deprive women of access to higher income and important capabilities. Women in these countries are disproportionately put at the highest risk of poverty and continue to face social and cultural barriers that prevent them from escaping poverty.

===East Asia===

Although China has grown tremendously in its economy over the past years, its economic growth has had minimal effect in mitigating the feminization of poverty. Economic growth did not reduce gender gaps in income or provide more formal employment opportunities for women. Instead, China's economic growth increased its use of informal employment, which has affected women disproportionately. In the Republic of Korea, low wages for women helped instigate an economic growth in Korea since low-cost exports were mostly produced by women. Similar to China, Korean women mostly had the opportunity for informal employment, which deprives women of financial stability and safe working environments. Although women in East Asia had greater access to employment, they faced job segregation in export industries, which placed them at a high risk of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;UNRISD. "[http://www.unrisd.org/80256B3C005BCCF9/%28httpAuxPages%29/8BACF1B0908D70E1C125778900323600?OpenDocument Gender Inequalities at Home and in the Market]." (2010): 5–33. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

China is a country with a long history of gender discrimination. In order to address gender inequality issues, Chinese leaders have created more access for women to obtain capabilities. As a result, Chinese women are granted greater access to health services, employment opportunities, and general recognition for their important contributions to the economy and society.&lt;ref name="Missing"/&gt;

===Morocco===

The female population, especially in rural areas, dominantly represents the face of poverty in [[Morocco]]. There have been two major methods to measure poverty in Morocco, which include the 'classic approach' and a second approach that pertains more towards the [[capabilities approach]]. The 'classic approach' uses the poverty line to statistically determine the impoverished population. This approach quantifies the number of poor individuals and households but does not take into account how the impoverished population lacks basic needs such as housing, food, health and education. The second approach focuses on satisfying this lack of basic needs and emphasizes the multidimensional nature of poverty.&lt;ref name="Morocco"/&gt;

Moroccan women represent the most economically insecure social group in the country. One of six Moroccan households are lone-mother households, which represent the most impoverished households in the country. Women are categorized to have the highest levels of socio-economic and legal constraints, which exclude them from obtaining their basic needs. Although recent surveys show that women actively help in providing for their families economically, Moroccan legal texts discourage women's participation in economic productivity. Article 114 of the Moroccan Family Law states, "every human being is responsible for providing for his needs by his own powers except the wife whose needs will be taken care of by her husband." The patriarchal social structure of Morocco puts women as being inferior to men in all aspects. Women are denied equal opportunities in education and employment before the law, as well as access to resources. As a result, the female population in Morocco suffers from deprivation of capabilities. Young girls are often excluded from educational opportunities due to limited financial resources within the household and the burden of household chores expected from them.&lt;ref name="Morocco"/&gt;

Over time, Moroccan women have gained more access to employment. However, this quantitative increase in labor participation for women has not been accompanied by higher qualitative standards of labor. The labor of rural women in Morocco remain unacknowledged and unpaid. Women are put into a higher risk of poverty as their domestic workload is added onto their unpaid labor. This balance of domestic labor and work outside the home imposes a burden on rural women. Since the socioeconomic exclusion of women deprive them of the capabilities to be educated and trained for certain employment skills, their susceptibility to poverty is heightened. Low educational skills of women directly relate to the limited employment options they have in society. Although both men and women are affected by unemployment, women are more likely to lose their jobs than men. Recent research in Morocco shows that economic recessions in the country affect women the most.&lt;ref name="Morocco"/&gt;

===United Kingdom===
An investigation of the feminization of poverty between 1959 and 1984 discovered a substantial increase in the percentage of female poor in the 1960s, but not in the 1970s or 1980s. The percentage remained relatively constant between 1969 and 1979, and then decreased between 1979 and 1984. The principal source of feminization of poverty was the proportion of women in one-sex households. This was more adverse for blacks than whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fuchs | first = Victor R. | author-link = Victor Fuchs | title = The feminization of poverty | journal = [[National Bureau of Economic Research|NBER Publications]] | id = w1934 | publisher = [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] | doi = 10.3386/w1934 | date = June 1986 | url = http://www.nber.org/papers/w1934 }} [http://www.nber.org/papers/w1934.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Wright | first = Robert E. | title = A feminization of poverty in Great Britain? | journal = [[Review of Income and Wealth]] | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–25 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4991.1992.tb00398.x | date = March 1992 | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-4991.1992.tb00398.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.roiw.org/1992/17.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1990 study conducted in the United Kingdom (UK),&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Davies | first1 = Hugh | last2 = Joshi | first2 = Heather | author-link2 = Heather Joshi | title = Gender and income inequality in the UK 1968–90: the feminization of earnings or of poverty? | journal = [[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society#Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A (Statistics in Society)|Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series A (Statistics in Society)]] | volume = 161 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–61 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/1467-985X.00089 | date = 1998 | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-985X.00089 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; nearly half of the employees in the study were women but these women counted for less than a third of the total weekly earnings.   There was no trend towards increasing feminization of poverty over the sample period (1968-1990).  Women's weekly earnings were less than half of those of men.  Although more women began to actively participate in providing for their families, over half of people in poverty were female and over 40% of impoverished households were lone-mother households. Lone-mother households were twice as likely to be poor as male-headed households.&lt;ref name=Davies /&gt;

Women's earnings in family income decrease as men's incomes increase. Inequality tends to be lower in households in which women gain access to full-time formal employment. Although married women's involvement in the labour market helped to keep their families out of poverty, their relatively low earnings were overall ineffective in moving their families up to the highest level of income distribution.&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt;
