==Definition, identity and relationships==
Aromanticism is defined as "having little or no romantic feeling towards others: experiencing little or no romantic desire or attraction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aromantic|title=Aromantic Definition &amp; Meaning - Merriam-Webster|access-date=25 March 2023|archive-date=25 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230325222124/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aromantic|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term aromantic was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://public.oed.com/updates/new-words-list-june-2018/|title=Oxford English Dictionary: New words list June 2018|date=June 2018|access-date=25 March 2023|archive-date=19 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211019231754/https://public.oed.com/updates/new-words-list-june-2018/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposite of aromanticism is [[wikt:alloromantic|alloromantic]]ism, defined as a romantic orientation in which one experiences romantic love or romantic attraction to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Micomonaco |first=Mikayla |date=June 28, 2017 |title=I'm Tired Of My Queer Identity Being Ignored &amp; Erased On TV |url=https://www.bustle.com/p/im-tired-of-my-queer-identity-being-ignored-erased-on-tv-66215 |access-date=2018-04-15 |website=Bustle |archive-date=2019-08-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815211423/https://www.bustle.com/p/im-tired-of-my-queer-identity-being-ignored-erased-on-tv-66215 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some individuals who fall on the aromantic spectrum of identities describe themselves as having experienced romantic love or romantic attraction at some point.

The early online community around aromanticism formed on the [[Asexual Visibility and Education Network]] (AVEN), an online community around asexuality, and social media platforms such as [[tumblr]].

Since then a dedicated online community centered around aromanticism has formed online on ''Arocalypse.com'' as well as other social media platforms, such as [[reddit]] on the ''aromantic'' sub-reddit.

In order to gain wider acceptance and recognition, a volunteer formed organization, the ''{{vanchor|Aromantic-spectrum Union for Recognition, Education, and Advocacy}}'' (AUREA), was formed to increase  recognition of and education on aromanticism and help people on the aromantic spectrum gain wider acceptance by the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a9644122/aromantic-definition-meaning/|title=Your Everything-to-Know Guide on What It Means to Be Aromantic|date=20 May 2022|website=Cosmopolitan|access-date=29 April 2023|archive-date=3 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210403084337/http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a9644122/aromantic-definition-meaning/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/living-single/202102/why-coupling-is-no-longer-compulsory|title=Why Coupling Is No Longer Compulsory|date=20 February 2021|website=Psychology Today|access-date=29 April 2023|archive-date=29 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230429210350/https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/living-single/202102/why-coupling-is-no-longer-compulsory|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="womenshealth" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://weareher.com/best-resources-to-learn-more-about-the-aromantic-spectrum/|title=Resources To Learn About the Aromantic Spectrum For Aromantic Awareness Week|date=23 February 2023|website=HER|access-date=29 April 2023|archive-date=25 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230425073659/https://weareher.com/best-resources-to-learn-more-about-the-aromantic-spectrum/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; AUREA is also the leading organizer of the annual ''Aromantic Spectrum Awareness Week'' held in February.&lt;ref name="aboutASAW"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arospecweek.org/about-asaw/|title=About ASAW|website=arospecweek.org|archive-date=26 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326214815/https://www.arospecweek.org/about-asaw/|access-date=22 April 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lgbtqnationasaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2021/02/ready-celebrate-big-aromantic-holiday-year/|title=Are you ready for Aromantic Spectrum Awareness Week?|date=15 February 2021|website=lgbtqnation.com|access-date=21 April 2023|archive-date=26 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326211814/https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2021/02/ready-celebrate-big-aromantic-holiday-year/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another community organization, ''{{vanchor|The Ace and Aro Advocacy Project}}'' (TAAAP), focuses on providing resources around both asexuality and aromanticism to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://taaap.org/home/|title=About TAAAP - The Ace and Aro Advocacy Project|access-date=2023-03-26|archive-date=2023-03-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326211812/https://taaap.org/home/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do so by creating and hosting workshops, developing  educational materials, and engaging in outreach within the [[LGBT|LGBTQIA+]] community and general public.

A white ring may be worn on one's left middle finger to indicate one’s identity on the aromantic spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aromantic Ring?!|date=March 29, 2015|url=https://www.asexuality.org/en/topic/116225-aromantic-ring/|access-date=March 11, 2023|archive-date=March 19, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230319210047/https://www.asexuality.org/en/topic/116225-aromantic-ring/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events===
====Aromantic Spectrum Awareness Week====
Aromantic Spectrum Awareness Week (ASAW) is held annually during the first full week after Valentine’s Day (beginning on Sunday).

The event was first recognized from November 10–17, 2014, and was subsequently moved to February in 2015 to be held the week after [[Valentine's Day]].&lt;ref name="aboutASAW" /&gt; It is an [[List of LGBT awareness periods|awareness period]] that was created to celebrate, raise awareness of, and bring acceptance to aromantic spectrum identities and the issues people on the aromantic spectrum face.&lt;ref name="lgbtqnationasaw" /&gt; ASAW is led and organized by the Aromantic-spectrum Union for Recognition, Education, and Advocacy (AUREA) and members of the aromantic community.&lt;ref name="lgbtqnationasaw" /&gt;

ASAW has been officially recognized by a handful of states in the United States including [[Washington (state)|Washington State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=February 25, 2021|title=Washington Becomes 5th State to Recognize Aro Week|url=http://www.seattleacesandaros.org/2021/02/25/washington-becomes-5th-state-to-recognize-aro-week/|access-date=March 11, 2023|archive-date=March 26, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326211812/http://www.seattleacesandaros.org/2021/02/25/washington-becomes-5th-state-to-recognize-aro-week/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lgbtq.wa.gov/events/aromantic-spectrum-awareness-week|title=Aromantic Spectrum Awareness Week|website=lgbtq.wa.gov|access-date=21 April 2023|archive-date=21 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230421232609/https://lgbtq.wa.gov/events/aromantic-spectrum-awareness-week|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Aromantic Visibility Day ====
The first annual ''{{Visible anchor|Aromantic Visibility Day}}'' was held on 5 June 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=aromantic_aurea|number=1665790023034363904|date=5 June 2023|title=June 5th is the first-ever Aromantic Visibility Day!

==Cultural representation==
Aromanticism is rarely depicted in media, but is slowly gaining more widespread acceptance and representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=February 19, 2016 |title=How Pop Culture Denies Aromantic Asexual Existence |url=https://www.themarysue.com/pop-culture-denies-aro-ace/ |access-date=April 15, 2018 |publisher=The Mary Sue |archive-date=April 6, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210406190655/https://www.themarysue.com/pop-culture-denies-aro-ace/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books and literature===
As aromanticism is slowly becoming more widely recognized and accepted, additional literature about it is being published.
TAAAP created a list of book recommendations as part of the Aromantic Spectrum Awareness Week 2022.&lt;ref&gt;https://bookshop.org/lists/aromantic-spectrum-awareness-week&lt;!--Bare url needs to be fixed later--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aromantic people===
For a list of people that have come out as aromantic, see [[List of people on the aromantic spectrum]].

==Discrimination and cultural erasure==
[[Discrimination]], fear and [[prejudice]] against aromantic people, commonly referred to as "arophobia", or when directed at both aromantic and asexual (aspec) people, "aphobia" is prevalent in both the general public as well as within the [[LGBT|LGBTQIA+]] community.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asexuals.net/aphobia/|title=Aphobia, understanding the discrimination and effects|date=29 January 2023|access-date=25 March 2023|archive-date=25 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230325211826/https://www.asexuals.net/aphobia/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth Brake]] coined the term [[amatonormativity]] in the book ''[[Minimizing Marriage]]'', meaning "the pressure or desire for monogamy, romance, and/or marriage". As aromanticism is directly counter to many western societal expectations, aromantic people face continued pressure and prejudice to conform to the "social norms" and form permanent romantic relationships.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Although aromantics and asexuals have existed for as long as humans have, the terminology and openness has only gone mainstream more recently.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|date=July 6, 2021|title=Why aromantic and asexual people belong in LGBTQIA+ community|url=https://news.temple.edu/news/2021-07-06/why-aromantic-and-asexual-people-belong-lgbtqia-community|access-date=March 11, 2023|archive-date=March 26, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326211821/https://news.temple.edu/news/2021-07-06/why-aromantic-and-asexual-people-belong-lgbtqia-community|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aromantic people are often left out of discussions and representations, including within the [[LGBTQIA+]] community itself.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; This extends to some people's and media organizations misuse of the expanded ''[[LGBT]]'' acronym LGBTQIA+ acronym itself wherein some people mistakenly claim that A in LGBTQIA+ stands for ally.
In actuality, the A in ''LGBTQIA+'' represents aromanticism, asexuality and [[agender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mercado |first=Mia |date=June 8, 2017 |title=Equinox Gym's Pride Video 'The LGBTQ Alphabet' Leaves Out An Important Letter |url=https://www.bustle.com/p/equinox-gyms-pride-video-the-lgbtqalphabet-leaves-out-important-letter-63252 |access-date=2018-04-15 |website=Bustle |archive-date=2020-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200810223928/https://www.bustle.com/p/equinox-gyms-pride-video-the-lgbtqalphabet-leaves-out-important-letter-63252 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glaadA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.glaad.org/blog/asexual-agender-aromantic|title=GLAAD - A is for Asexual, Agender, Aromantic|date=11 February 2015|access-date=26 March 2023|archive-date=26 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326211810/https://www.glaad.org/blog/asexual-agender-aromantic|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dastagir |first=Alia E. |date=June 15, 2017 |title=LGBTQ definitions every good ally should know |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/06/15/lgbtq-glossary-slang-ally-learn-language/101200092/ |access-date=2018-04-15 |work=USA Today |archive-date=2021-04-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210404084233/https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/06/15/lgbtq-glossary-slang-ally-learn-language/101200092/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/matthews-place/why-the-a-doesnt-stand-for-ally-b31395c06150|title=Why the A doesn't stand for Ally|date=19 May 2020|access-date=26 March 2023|archive-date=26 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326211811/https://medium.com/matthews-place/why-the-a-doesnt-stand-for-ally-b31395c06150|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This erasure extends into modern TV media, very prominently that of the character [[Jughead Jones]], who is asexual and aromantic: in the 2017 Television show [[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]], the writers chose to depict Jughead as a heterosexual despite pleas from both fans and Jughead actor [[Cole Sprouse]] to retain Jughead's asexual aromantic identity to allow the community to be represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Riverdale's' Asexual Erasure Can be Harmful|date=April 14, 2017|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/riverdales-asexual-erasure-can-be-harmful|access-date=March 11, 2023|archive-date=December 5, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201205000100/https://www.teenvogue.com/story/riverdales-asexual-erasure-can-be-harmful|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To counteract the stigma and discrimination against aromantic people, various community and health and wellness organizations have published articles and educational materials to educate the public.&lt;ref name="theguardian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ourspectrum.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/What-is-Aphobia.pdf |title=Aphobia: Common Attitudes and Expressions|date=October 2021|access-date=25 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230315230712/https://www.ourspectrum.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/What-is-Aphobia.pdf|archive-date=15 March 2023|website=ourspectrum.com|publisher=Waterloo Region's Rainbow Community Space}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pflag.org/resource/aromantic-resources/|title=Aromantic Resources - PFLAG|access-date=25 March 2023|archive-date=26 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326211812/https://pflag.org/resource/aromantic-resources/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[English people|English]] aromantic and asexual activist [[Yasmin Benoit]] called out that this erasure expands to official government offices, such as the [[Government Equalities Office]] not yet acknowledging aromanticism in their latest LGBT Survey and people having to label themselves under "other" instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.swlondoner.co.uk/life/21022023-activist-shares-her-story-for-aromantic-awareness-week|title=Activist shares her story for Aromantic Awareness Week|date=21 February 2023|access-date=28 March 2023|website=SWLondoner|archive-date=30 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230330041847/https://www.swlondoner.co.uk/life/21022023-activist-shares-her-story-for-aromantic-awareness-week|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is worth noting that sometimes this erasure of aromantic identities even happens within the aspec community itself, with people assuming that aromanticism and asexuality are the same thing, when in actuality they are actually different things and many aromantic people do not identify as asexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.webmd.com/sex/what-does-aromantic-mean|title=Aromanticism: What Does It Mean? - WebMD|date=27 June 2021|access-date=25 March 2023|archive-date=26 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326211810/https://www.webmd.com/sex/what-does-aromantic-mean|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shape.com/lifestyle/sex-and-love/what-is-aromantic|title=What Does it Mean to be Aromantic - Shape|date=28 December 2021|access-date=25 March 2023|archive-date=26 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326211811/https://www.shape.com/lifestyle/sex-and-love/what-is-aromantic|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Aromantic Census 2020, 82.43% of respondents reported not being taken seriously, being ignored, or being dismissed by others. 48.34% reported having experienced attempts or suggestions to "fix" or "cure" them. 70.51% of respondents indicated some impact of discrimination against their aromantic identity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Research==
As the general term of aromanticism is still relatively young, studies on aromanticism in the [[scientific research]] field are still scarce and under-researched&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Ben |last1=Brandley |first2=Marco |last2=Dehnert |date=17 March 2023 |title="I am not a Robot, I am Asexual": A Qualitative Critique of Allonormative Discourses of Ace and Aro Folks as Robots, Aliens, Monsters |journal=Journal of Homosexuality |pages=1–24 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00918369.2023.2185092 |doi=10.1080/00918369.2023.2185092 |pmid=36929881 |s2cid=257583622 |access-date=26 March 2023 |archive-date=26 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326211809/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00918369.2023.2185092 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and of the few studies that exist, many treat aromanticism as a sub-set of [[asexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Ana Catarina |last1=Carvalho |first2=David L. |last2=Rodrigues |date=2022 |title=Sexuality, Sexual Behavior, and Relationships of Asexual Individuals: Differences Between Aromantic and Romantic Orientation |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-021-02187-2 |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=2159–2168 |doi=10.1007/s10508-021-02187-2 |pmid=35334025 |hdl=10071/25315 |s2cid=242569971 |access-date=2023-03-26 |archive-date=2023-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326211813/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-021-02187-2 |url-status=live |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept that there is a distinction between romantic and sexual orientation has not been studied extensively yet,&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite book|first=Anthony F. |last=Bogaert |title=Understanding Asexuality |date=9 August 2012 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers |isbn=978-1442200999}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the diversity of attraction has been progressively recognized in newer studies.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Emily M. |last1=Lund |first2=Katie B. |last2=Thomas |first3=Christina M. |last3=Sias |first4=April R. |last4=Bradley |date=21 November 2016 |title=Examining Concordant and Discordant Sexual and Romantic Attraction in American Adults: Implications for Counselors |journal=Journal of LGBT Issues in Counseling |pages=211–226 |volume=10 |issue=4 |doi=10.1080/15538605.2016.1233840 |s2cid=151856457 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15538605.2016.1233840 |access-date=26 March 2023 |archive-date=26 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326211810/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15538605.2016.1233840 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Alyssa N. |last1=Clark |first2=Corinne |last2=Zimmerman |date=5 April 2022 |title=Concordance Between Romantic Orientations and Sexual Attitudes: Comparing Allosexual and Asexual Adults |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-021-02194-3 |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=2147–2157 |doi=10.1007/s10508-021-02194-3 |pmid=35380311 |s2cid=247955047 |access-date=26 March 2023 |archive-date=18 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230218225035/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-021-02194-3 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2022 study on concordance between romantic orientation and sexual attitudes found that while there is some concordance between romantic orientation and sexual orientation, the two were not a complete match, suggesting that the experience of split attraction between romantic and sexual orientation exists both in allosexual as well in asexual people. The authors also note that they were surprised that out of their sample population, as compared to asexual participants, only few allosexual people self-identified as aromantic and hypothesize that this may be due to the unfamiliarity with the concept and term.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

According to Debra Laino, an [[AASECT]]-certified clinical sexologist and relationship coach, one of the most common misconceptions around aromantic people is that they do not want to have sex. She explains that "aromantic people can still feel sexual attraction, but they might not identify with the way romance is often present in current media and culture."&lt;ref name="womenshealth"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.womenshealthmag.com/relationships/a26116061/aromantic-definition-sexuality-meaning/|title=Aromantic Definition - What it Means &amp; How It Differs From Asexuality|date=25 April 2022|access-date=26 March 2023|publisher=Women's Health|archive-date=26 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326114101/https://www.womenshealthmag.com/relationships/a26116061/aromantic-definition-sexuality-meaning/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A research article from 2021 discusses [[zines]] and their role within the aromantic and asexual community to help people navigate their identity and the authors note that aromanticism is "too often explored as a tag-on to asexuality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Ela |last1=Przybylo |first2=Kaiya |last2=Jacob |title=The Erotic Worldmaking of Asexual and Aromantic Zines |journal=QED: A Journal on GLBTQ Worldmaking |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=25–48 |date=1 February 2021 |url=https://scholarlypublishingcollective.org/msup/qed/article-abstract/8/1/25/286334/The-Erotic-Worldmaking-of-Asexual-and-Aromantic |doi=10.14321/qed.8.1.0025 |s2cid=238938385 |access-date=26 March 2023 |archive-date=26 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326211811/https://scholarlypublishingcollective.org/msup/qed/article-abstract/8/1/25/286334/The-Erotic-Worldmaking-of-Asexual-and-Aromantic |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prevalence===
The representation of aromantic people within the general population is not yet well understood. Of the population of asexual people, which is believed to be approximately 1% of the general population, about 26% also identified as aromantic.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; There is however not much qualitative or quantitative research around how many allosexual people also identify as aromantic, thus making it hard to say how much of the general public identifies as aromantic.

One study of 414 American adults found that about 1% of participants indicated that they were not romantically attracted to either sex (i.e. aromantic). The study also found that about 10.6% of participants had discordant (different) romantic and sexual orientations.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

===Calls for more research on aromanticism===
Aromanticism as its own term originated within the asexual community online, but newer research is acknowledging that romantic and sexual orientation are not one and the same and attitudes towards recognition of this separation and difference are changing.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
A contributing factor to this is that many people have difficulty distinguishing between romantic and sexual attraction as they intertwined for most people&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; and that between 19% and 28% of asexual individuals do also identify as aromantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://psychcentral.com/health/what-is-aromantic#aros-but-not-an-ace|title=Never Been Interested in Romance?

Calls for more research around aromanticism and asexuality are highlighted by a recent study centered on the thematic analysis of online communications within the aromantic and asexual community, which highlights that [[allonormativity]] is prevalent in the field of [[communication studies]] and needs to be combated in order to provide qualitative academic work around aromanticism and asexuality.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

===Community research===
The Aromantic-spectrum Union for Recognition, Education, and Advocacy (AUREA) is supporting researchers interested in studying the field of aromanticism and hosts an archive of [https://www.aromanticism.org/en/research research on aromanticism]. Some of the research listed is peer-reviewed, but the organization has also supported some community surveys.

A Census was performed by AUREA in 2020 to gather information of the aromantic community.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aromanticism.org/aro-census|title=The Aro Census 2020 Report|date=July 2021|access-date=25 March 2023|archive-date=26 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326211814/https://www.aromanticism.org/aro-census|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The census received 9,758 responses from aromantics around the world. Of the respondents, a majority identified as asexual, but about a third of respondents did not identify as asexual, highlighting that aromanticism is not strictly a subset of asexuality and should not simply be categorized as such. The Census Authors acknowledged that the respondent participant pool was overrepresented by people identifying as asexual as well as other geographic, demographic and linguistic skews as the census was only available in English and due to the predominantly online recruitment method.
The organization is planning to repeat the census on a semi-annual basis, but has not yet released the 2022 census.

Another community survey was performed in 2021 within the aromantic community specifically targeting the allosexual aromantic community to highlight the existence of aromantic people that are not asexual. The survey had 647 responses; the majority of respondents identified as queer at 43% and only 8.8% as heterosexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WlLiH46EkjQmEJcm05N6ApppKJlD9jsi4V_zlR4YpGE/edit#heading=h.eksecayc2ebk|title=Allo Aro Survey Results|date=2021|access-date=26 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220203041031/https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WlLiH46EkjQmEJcm05N6ApppKJlD9jsi4V_zlR4YpGE/edit|archive-date=3 February 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;
