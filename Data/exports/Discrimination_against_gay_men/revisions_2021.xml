'''Discrimination against gay men''', sometimes called ''[[Wikt:gayphobia#Noun|gayphobia]]'', is a form of [[homophobic]] prejudice, hatred, or bias specifically directed toward [[gay men]], male [[homosexuality]], or men who are [[Perception|perceived]] to be gay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clauss-Ehlers |first1=Caroline S. |title=Encyclopedia of Cross-Cultural School Psychology |date=2010 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9780387717982 |page=524 |edition=2 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Encyclopedia_of_Cross_Cultural_School_Ps/PaO3jsaGkeYC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1 |access-date=3 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=No More, No Less |url=https://www.csn.qc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/csn_no_more_no_less_anglais_final.pdf |website=Sexual and Gender Diversity |publisher=Confédération des syndicats nationaux |access-date=1 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="National Action Plan"&gt;{{cite web |title=2020-2023 National Action Plan to Promote Equal Rights and Combat Anti-LGBT+ Hatred and Discrimination |url=https://www.gouvernement.fr/sites/default/files/contenu/piece-jointe/2020/12/dilcrah_plan-lgbt_2020-2023_en_0.pdf |website=# France LGBT+ |publisher=The Government of the French Republic |access-date=3 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=gayphobia |url=https://glosbe.com/en/en/gayphobia |website=Glosbe |access-date=1 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discrimination is closely related to ''[[Wikt:femmephobia#Noun|femmephobia]]'', which is the dislike of, or hostility toward, individuals who present as feminine, including gay and [[effeminate]] men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paul |first1=Annie |title=Caribbean Culture: Soundings on Kamau Brathwaite |date=September 26, 2008 |publisher=University of the West Indies Press |isbn=9789766401504 |page=368 |edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination against gay men can result from prejudicial reactions to one's feminine [[mannerisms]], styles of [[clothing]], and even [[vocal register]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Loftin |first1=Craig M. |title=Unacceptable Mannerisms: Gender Anxieties, Homosexual Activism, and Swish in the United States, 1945-1965 |journal=Journal of Social History |date=2007 |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=577–596 |doi=10.1353/jsh.2007.0053 |jstor=4491939 |s2cid=143995645 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4491939 |access-date=4 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barry |first1=Ben |last2=Martin |first2=Dylan |title=Gender rebels: inside the wardrobes of young gay men with subversive style |journal=Fashion, Style &amp; Popular Culture |date=2016 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=225–250 |doi=10.1386/fspc.3.2.225_1 |url=http://www.refashioningmasculinity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016._Gender_rebels_inside_the_wardrobes.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201105062631/http://www.refashioningmasculinity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016._Gender_rebels_inside_the_wardrobes.pdf |access-date=4 March 2021|archive-date=2020-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Meredith |first1=Natasha |title=Gay men who 'sound gay' encounter more stigma and discrimination from heterosexual peers |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-02/uos-gmw021521.php |website=EurekAlert! |publisher=University of Surrey |access-date=4 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[LGBT]]-community, [[Internalization (sociology)|internalized]] issues around meeting social expectations of [[masculinity]] have been found among gay, bisexual, and transgender men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=F.

==Queer theory==

In French academia, queer theorists have examined the unique ways in which [[patriarchy]] attempts to enforce both [[masculinity]] and [[heterosexuality]] on those with [[male]] bodies. The French queer and race theorist [[:fr:Louis-Georges Tin|Louis-Georges Tin]] examined discrimination against gay men, and the historical development of the various forms of LGBT-related phobias under the umbrella of ''homophobia''. He writes:

{{quote|There has been an inverse movement of lexical differentiation operating at the heart of the concept of [[homophobia]]. Because of the specificity of attitudes towards [[lesbianism]], the term [[lesbophobia]] has been introduced into theoretic discourses, a term which brings to light particular mechanisms that the generic concept of homophobia tends to overshadow. With one stroke, this distinction justifies the term ''gayphobia'', since much homophobic discourse, in reality, pertains only to [[male homosexuality]]. Similarly, the concept of [[biphobia]] has also been proposed in order to highlight the singular situation of [[bisexuals]], often stigmatized by both heterosexual and homosexual communities. Moreover, we need to take into consideration the very different issues linked to transsexual, transvestite, and [[transgender]] persons, which brings to mind the notion of [[transphobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Dictionary_of_Homophobia/aK02DwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=The Dictionary of Homophobia: A Global History of Gay &amp; Lesbian Experience |date=November 2008 |publisher=arsenal pulp press |isbn=9781551523149 |access-date=2021-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In her 2017 text, ''The Women's Liberation Movement: Impacts and Outcomes'', the German gender historian {{ill|Kristina Schulz|de}} noted that within the Western media landscape during the 1970s' [[Gay Rights Movement]], prejudice against gay men attracted more media attention than lesbophobia, largely due to the rhetoric of reactionary conservatives such as [[Anita Bryant]], who suggested that gay men were sexual predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schulz |first1=Kristina |title=The Women's Liberation Movement: Impacts and Outcomes |date=2017 |publisher=Berghahn Books |location=Oxford |isbn=9781785335877 |page=164 |edition=1 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Women_s_Liberation_Movement/mJ3vDQAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=9781785335877&amp;printsec=frontcover |access-date=5 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination in society==
[[File:Wilfred De Bruijn wounded - Same-sex Marriage in France.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[:fr:Wilfred De Bruijn|Wilfred de Bruijn]] in 2013]]

According to the [[Government of France|French government]], discrimination against gay men "is a form of homophobia that specifically affects men. Although it is primarily aimed at gay and bisexual men, it can also affect [[heterosexual]] men who are perceived as homosexual. Gay men may be targets of physical aggression or devalued by stereotypes linked to [[femininity|feminisation]] and [[hypersexualisation]]."&lt;ref name="National Action Plan"/&gt;

The journalist Pierre Bouvier described anti-gay male sentiment as parallel to [[lesbophobia]]. Noting how these two different forms of homophobia operate in [[Western cultures]], he wrote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bouvier |first1=Pierre |title=Pride march: 'Lesbians are not necessarily found in the speeches of many LGBT associations' |url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ghXxDqTvBpcJ:https://www.hebergementwebs.com/business/pride-march-lesbians-are-not-necessarily-found-in-the-speeches-of-many-lgbt-associations+&amp;cd=128&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=safari |website=Hebergement |access-date=3 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;There is very clearly a difference in mechanisms between gayphobia and lesbophobia, and this translates into different types of aggression. Where the [[Collective imaginary|collective imagination]] over-sexualizes gay men and exerts strong verbal and physical violence against boys and men who are not considered sufficiently masculine or heterosexual; for women, on the other hand, the assertion of their lesbian identity will be further disqualified, minimized, reduced to a fad, or even sexualized as a prelude to heterosexuality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Academic studies==
In [[peer-reviewed]] studies which break down and distinguish homophobia separately between discrimination against gay men and lesbians, researchers have found [[statistically significant]] differences between heterosexual men and women in regards to their attitudes toward gay men.&lt;ref name="Relations among gender"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gabriella |first1=Martino |title=Relations among gender, religiosity and personality traits in homophobia |journal=Journal of Clinical &amp; Developmental Psychology |date=2019 |volume=1 |issue=2 |page=1-11 |doi=10.6092/2612-4033/0110-2046 |url=https://cab.unime.it/journals/index.php/JCDP/article/viewFile/2046/pdf |access-date=1 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; While no statistically significant differences were found in men and women in regard to lesbians, heterosexual men do demonstrate statistically significant elevated levels of animosity toward men they perceive as gay.&lt;ref name="Relations among gender"/&gt;
