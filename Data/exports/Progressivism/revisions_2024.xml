'''Progressivism''' is a [[Left-right political spectrum|left-leaning]] [[political philosophy]] and [[Reformism|reform]] [[political movement|movement]] that seeks to advance the [[human condition]] through [[social reform]] – primarily based on purported advancements in [[social organization]], [[science]], and [[technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/progressivism|title=Progressivism in English|work=Oxford English Dictionary|access-date=2 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321174257/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/progressivism|archive-date=21 March 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents hold that progressivism has universal application and endeavor to spread this idea to human societies everywhere. Progressivism arose during the [[Age of Enlightenment]] out of the belief that [[civility]] in Europe was improving due to the application of new [[Empirical evidence|empirical knowledge]].&lt;ref name="Harold Mah 1914. p157"&gt;Harold Mah.

In modern political discourse, progressivism is often associated with [[social liberalism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Klaus P.

[[Immanuel Kant]] identified progress as being a movement away from [[Barbarian|barbarism]] toward [[civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kant |first1=Immanuel |last2=Reiss |first2=Hans Siegbert |title=Kant: political writings |url=https://archive.org/details/kantpoliticalwri00kant/page/41/mode/2up |publisher=Cambridge [England]; New York: Cambridge University Press |date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; 18th-century philosopher and political scientist [[Marquis de Condorcet]] predicted that political progress would involve the disappearance of [[slavery]], the rise of [[literacy]], the lessening of [[sex inequality]], [[prison reform|reform of prisons]], which at the time were harsh, and the decline of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Robert (1980). ''History of the Idea of Progress''. New York: Basic Books. ch 5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modernity]] or modernisation was a key form of the idea of progress as promoted by [[classical liberals]] in the 19th and 20th centuries, who called for the rapid modernisation of the economy and society to remove the traditional hindrances to [[free market]]s and the [[Freedom of movement|free movements]] of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Joyce Appleby |author2=Lynn Hunt |author3=Margaret Jacob |name-list-style=amp |title=Telling the Truth about History |year=1995 |page=78 |publisher=W.

In the late 19th century, a political view rose in popularity in the Western world that progress was being stifled by vast [[economic inequality]] between the rich and the poor, minimally regulated ''[[laissez-faire]]'' capitalism with out-of-control monopolistic [[corporation]]s, intense and often violent conflict between capitalists and workers, with a need for measures to address these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Progressivism: A Very Short Introduction|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Nugent, Walter|year=2010|isbn=9780195311068|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Progressivism has influenced various political movements. [[Social liberalism]] was influenced by British [[Liberalism|liberal]] philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]]'s conception of people being "progressive beings."&lt;ref&gt;Alan Ryan. ''The Making of Modern Liberalism''. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; British Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] developed [[progressive conservatism]] under [[One-nation conservatism|one-nation]] [[Toryism]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Dunleavy, Paul Joseph Kelly, Michael Moran. ''British Political Science: Fifty Years of Political Studies''. Oxford, England; Malden, Massachusetts: Wiley-Blackwell, 2000. pp. 107–108. {{ISBN?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Blake. ''Disraeli''. Second Edition. London: Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode (Publishers) Ltd, 1967. p. 524.{{ISBN?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the space between [[social revolution]] and the [[socially conservative]] ''laissez-faire'' [[centre-right]] was filled with the emergence of [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]] which thought that [[social progress]] required [[anti-clericalism]], [[humanism]], and [[republicanism]]. Especially anti-clericalism was the dominant influence on the [[centre-left]] in many French- and Romance-speaking countries until the mid-20th century. In [[Imperial Germany]], Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] enacted various progressive [[social welfare]] measures out of [[paternalistic conservative]] motivations to distance workers from the [[socialist movement]] of the time and as humane ways to assist in maintaining the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;'' Union Contributions to Labor Welfare Policy and Practice: Past, Present, and Future''. Routledge, 16, 2013. p. 172. {{ISBN?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' issued by [[Pope Leo XIII]] condemned the [[exploitation of labor]] and urged support for [[labor unions]] and [[government regulation]] of businesses in the interests of [[social justice]] while upholding the [[property right]] and criticising socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Faith Jaycox. ''The Progressive Era''. New York: Infobase Publishing, 2005. p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; A  progressive [[Protestant]] outlook called the [[Social Gospel]] emerged in North America that focused on challenging economic exploitation and poverty and, by the mid-1890s, was common in many Protestant theological seminaries in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Howard Hopkins, ''The Rise of the Social Gospel in American Protestantism, 1865–1915'' (1940). {{page needed|date=May 2022}}{{ISBN?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early 20th-century progressivism included support for American engagement in [[World War I]] and the creation of and participation in the [[League of Nations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=2005|last=Freeden|first=Michael|author-link=Michael Freeden|title=Liberal Languages: Ideological Imaginations and Twentieth-Century Progressive Thought|pages=144–165|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=[[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Lpu8wwvA1AC&amp;pg=144|isbn=9780691116778}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ambrosius |first1=Lloyd E. |title=Woodrow Wilson, Alliances, and the League of Nations |journal=The Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era |date=April 2006 |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=139–165 |doi=10.1017/S153778140000298X|s2cid=162853992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[compulsory sterilisation]] in Scandinavia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4026900|title=Geneticists and the Eugenics Movement in Scandinavia|last=Roll-Hansen|first=Nils|journal=[[The British Journal for the History of Science]]|volume=22|issue=3|pages=335–346|date=1989|doi=10.1017/S0007087400026194|pmid=11621984|s2cid=44566095}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[eugenics]] in Great Britain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Retrospectives: Eugenics and Economics in the Progressive Era |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |year=2005 |last=Leonard |first=Thomas |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=207–224 |doi=10.1257/089533005775196642 |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/retrospectives.pdf |access-date=2017-10-22 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820132528/https://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/retrospectives.pdf |archive-date=20 August 2017 |df=dmy-all |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[temperance movement]].&lt;ref&gt;James H.

In the United States, progressivism began as an intellectual rebellion against the political philosophy of [[Constitutionalism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2018/entries/constitutionalism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Wil|last=Waluchow|chapter=Constitutionalism |editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=17 August 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; as expressed by  [[John Locke]] and the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founders of the American Republic]], whereby the authority of government depends on observing limitations on its just powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Watson | first = Bradley | title = Progressivism : the strange history of a radical idea | page = 11 | publisher = University of Notre Dame Press | location = Notre Dame, Indiana | year = 2020 | isbn = 9780268106973 }}&lt;/ref&gt; What began as a [[social movement]] in the 1890s grew into a popular [[political movement]] referred to as the [[Progressive era]]; in the [[1912 United States presidential election]], all three U.S. presidential candidates claimed to be progressives. While the term ''progressivism'' represents a range of diverse [[political pressure group]]s, not always united, progressives rejected [[social Darwinism]], believing that the problems society faced, such as [[class warfare]], [[greed]], [[poverty]], [[racism]] and [[violence]], could best be addressed by providing good education, a safe environment, and an efficient workplace. Progressives lived mainly in the cities, were college educated, and believed in a strong central government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/progressive-era.cfm "The Progressive Era (1890–1920)"]. The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200120210506/https://www2.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/progressive-era.cfm|date=20 January 2020}}. Retrieved 31 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and later the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] declared that he "always believed that wise progressivism and wise conservatism go hand in hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jonathan | last=Lurie | title=William Howard Taft: The Travails of a Progressive Conservative | location=New York | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2012 | page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Woodrow Wilson]] was also a member of the American progressive movement within the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Progressive stances have evolved. [[Imperialism]] was a controversial issue within progressivism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the United States, where some progressives supported [[American imperialism]] while others opposed it.&lt;ref name="Nugent"&gt;{{cite book|title=Progressivism: A Very Short Introduction|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Nugent, Walter|year=2010|isbn=9780195311068|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to [[World War I]], President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]] established the concept of national [[self-determination]] and criticised imperialist competition and colonial injustices. [[Anti-imperialists]] supported these views in areas resisting imperial rule.&lt;ref&gt;'' Reconsidering Woodrow Wilson: Progressivism, Internationalism, War, and Peace''. p. 309. {{ISBN?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period of acceptance of economic [[Keynesianism]] (the 1930s–1970s), there was widespread acceptance in many nations of a large role for [[state intervention]] in the economy. With the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and challenges to state [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] policies in the 1970s and 1980s, [[centre-left]] progressive movements responded by adopting the [[Third Way]], which emphasised a major role for the [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Jane Lewis, Rebecca Surender. ''Welfare State Change: Towards a Third Way?''. [[Oxford University Press]], 2004. pp. 3–4, 16. {{ISBN?}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been [[social democrats]] who have called for the social-democratic movement to move past Third Way.&lt;ref&gt;'' After the Third Way: The Future of Social Democracy in Europe''. I.B. Taurus, 2012. p. 47. {{ISBN?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent [[Progressive conservatism|progressive conservative]] elements in the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] have criticised neoliberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Bochel. ''The Conservative Party and Social Policy''. The Policy Press, 2011. p. 108. {{ISBN?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, progressives continue to favour [[public policy]] that they theorise will reduce or lessen the harmful effects of [[economic inequality]] as well as systemic [[discrimination]] such as [[institutional racism]]; to advocate for [[social safety net]]s and [[workers' rights]]; and to oppose [[corporate]] influence on the democratic process. The unifying theme is to call attention to the negative impacts of current institutions or ways of doing things and to advocate for [[social progress]], i.e., for positive change as defined by any of several standards such as the expansion of [[democracy]], increased [[egalitarianism]] in the form of [[Economic egalitarianism|economic]] and [[social equality]] as well as improved well being of a population. Proponents of social democracy have identified themselves as promoting the progressive cause.&lt;ref&gt;Henning Meyer, Jonathan Rutherford.

== Types ==
=== Cultural progressivism ===
Progressivism, in the general sense, mainly means social and cultural progressivism. The term ''[[cultural liberalism]]'' is used in a substantially similar context and can be said to be a synonym for cultural progressivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Nancy L. Cohen |title=Delirium: The Politics of Sex in America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J90REAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=%22Cultural+liberal%22+Cultural+progressive&amp;pg=PT145 |quote= When the going got tough, the economic progressives got going back to the Reagan days when the cultural progressives were to blame. Clinton's presidential campaign had "signaled cultural moderation and articulated the pocketbook frustrations of ordinary people," Robert Kuttner, editor of ''The American Prospect'' ventured. "But in office, he seemed a cultural liberal who failed to produce on economics." |date=2012 |publisher=Catapult |isbn=9781619020962 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike progressives in a broader sense, some cultural progressives may be economically [[Centrism|centrist]], [[Fiscal conservatism|conservative]], or politically [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]. The [[Czech Pirate Party]] is classified as a (cultural or social) progressive party,&lt;ref name="politicalcritique.org 8 January 2018"/&gt; but it calls itself "economically centrist and socially liberal".&lt;ref&gt;[https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2710052-pirati-se-schazeji-v-tabore-sest-se-jich-se-utka-o-vedeni-kandidatky-do-evropskeho "Piráti chtějí vést liberální politický střed a v květnu získat 20 procent, zaznělo na fóru v Táboře"] (in Czech). [[ČT24]]. 19 January 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic progressivism ===
{{main|Economic progressivism}}
''Economic progressivism''—also ''New Progressive Economics''&lt;ref name=vox20241004&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/377170/kamala-harris-economic-policy-new-progressive-economics |title=The rise — and fall? — of the New Progressive Economics |last=Prokop|first=Andrew |work=[[Vox Media|Vox]] |date=4 October 2024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—is a term used to distinguish it from ''progressivism'' in cultural fields. Economic progressives may draw from a variety of economic traditions, including [[democratic capitalism]], [[democratic socialism]], [[social democracy]], and [[social liberalism]]. Overall, economic progressives' views are rooted in the concept of [[social justice]] and the [[common good]], and aim to improve the human condition through [[government regulation]], [[social protection]]s and the maintenance of [[Public good (economics)|public goods]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2011/03/14/9311/the-origins-and-evolution-of-progressive-economics/ "The Origins and Evolution of Progressive Economics"].&lt;/ref&gt; Some economic progressives may show [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] views on cultural issues. These movements are related to [[Communitarianism|communitarian]] conservative movements such as [[Christian democracy]] and [[one-nation conservatism]].&lt;ref name="catholicnewsagency"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cruxnow.com/interviews/2018/11/new-political-party-says-its-roots-are-in-catholic-social-teaching/|title=New political party says its roots are in Catholic Social Teaching|date=26 November 2018 |quote=I was working on my doctoral dissertation largely concerning difficulties and opportunities for socially conservative, economically progressive movements, and desired to get involved in such movements ... and was glad to see that ASP was interested in applying such ways of thinking to contemporary issues. |access-date=17 November 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Techno progressivism ===
{{main|Techno-progressivism}}
An early mention of ''techno-progressivism'' appeared in 1999 as the removal of "all political, cultural, biological, and psychological limits to self-actualization and self-realization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sikora |first1=Tomasz |title=The Cultural Dimension of Waste: a Critique of the Ethos of Technology. Economic and Environmental Studies |date=2003 |page=103-112 |url=https://czasopisma.uni.opole.pl/index.php/ees/article/download/2816/2272}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to techno-progressivism, scientific and technical aspects of progress are linked to ethical and social developments in society. Therefore, according to the majority of techno-progressive viewpoints, advancements in science and technology will not be considered proper progress until and unless they are accompanied by a fair distribution of the costs, risks, and rewards of these new capabilities. Many techno-progressive critics and supporters believe that while improved democracy, increased justice, decreased violence, and a broader culture of rights are all desirable, they are insufficient on their own to address the problems of modern technological societies unless and until they are accompanied by scientific and technological advancements that uphold and apply these ideals.&lt;ref name="Carrico 2004"&gt;{{cite web |first=Dale |last=Carrico |title=The Trouble with "Transhumanism": Part Two |date=2004 |url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/carrico20041222/ |access-date=2007-01-28 |authorlink=Dale Carrico |journal= |archive-date=2016-09-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908070459/http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/carrico20041222 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carrico 2005"&gt;{{cite web |first=Dale |last=Carrico |authorlink=Dale Carrico |title=Technoprogressivism Beyond Technophilia and Technophobia |date=2005 |url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/carrico20060812/ |access-date=2007-01-28 |journal= |archive-date=2016-09-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908070510/http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/carrico20060812 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{SPS|date=September 2022}}

== Progressive parties or parties with progressive factions ==
{{party politics}}
&lt;!--Rather than mainstream center-left or left-wing parties with a long history as possible, it is recommended to focus on political parties with prominent socially progressive tendencies such as [[Czech Pirate Party]], [[Más Madrid]], and [[Syriza]].--&gt;
