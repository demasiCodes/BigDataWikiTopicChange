This term is preferred by many over the more traditional label in American politics, [[liberal]], because of the frequent association of '[[liberal]]' with the centrist politics of many Democratic Party politicians (such as Al Gore) in recent years.  The term "progressive" is thus used to avoid confusion between centrist and genuinely left-wing views.

'Progressive' is used in place of ''liberal'' to best describe philosophical ideals that are opposite and contrasted to those held by [[conservatism|conservatives]]. Political ideas that advocate rapid social change for example, are likely to be &lt;b&gt;progressive&lt;/b&gt;, while conservative ideas tend to reflect an adherence to established norms. Continuing logically, by this spectrum, a philosophy that advocated reversing course to previous standards would be [[Political regressive|regressive]], though this term is rarely used.  Instead, the term ''reactionary'' is more frequetly used to describe those who wish to turn back the clock.

This is particularly useful when dealing with philosophical positions, since the liberal tradition has very particular and fixed [[Enlightenment]] connotations that may not necessarily have any useful meaning in the Left political scene.

The term has its origin in American politics in the early part of the twentieth century.  During this period, known as the [[Progressive Era]], many reforms were enacted.  Some third-party presidential candidates ran for office during this time under the Progressive Pary label, notably [[Robert LaFollette]].

This term is also used in [[Canada]], since many liberals are not Liberals, i.e. do not support the centrist [[Liberal Party of Canada]]. Not to be confused with the [[Progressive Conservative Party|Progressive Conservatives.]]</rev></revisions></page></pages></query></api>
