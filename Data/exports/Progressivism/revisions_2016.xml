{{Progressivism}}

'''Progressivism''' is a [[philosophy]] based on the [[Idea of Progress]], which asserts that advancement in [[science]], [[technology]], [[economic development]], and [[social organization]] are vital to improve the [[human condition]]. Progressivism became highly significant during the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in [[Europe]], out of the belief that Europe was demonstrating that societies could progress in [[civility]] from barbaric conditions to civilization through strengthening the basis of [[empirical evidence|empirical knowledge]] as the foundation of society.&lt;ref name="Harold Mah 1914. p157"&gt;Harold Mah. [https://books.google.com/?id=WVlGIelNNNcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Enlightenment Phantasies: Cultural Identity in France and Germany, 1750-1914]. Cornell University. (2003). p157.&lt;/ref&gt; Figures of the Enlightenment believed that progress had [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]] application to all societies and that these ideas would spread across the world from Europe.&lt;ref name="Harold Mah 1914. p157"/&gt; Sociologist [[Robert Nisbet]] defines five "crucial premises" of the Idea of Progress as being: value of the past; nobility of [[Western culture|Western civilization]]; worth of economic/technological growth; scientific/scholarly knowledge obtained through reason over faith; the intrinsic importance and worth of life on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Robert (1980). History of the Idea of Progress. New York: Basic Books. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this, the meanings of progressivism have varied over time and from different perspectives.

The contemporary common political conception of progressivism in the [[Western culture|culture of the Western world]] emerged from the vast [[social change]]s brought about by [[industrialization]] in the Western world in the late 19th century, particularly out of the view that progress was being stifled by vast [[economic inequality]] between the rich and the poor; minimally regulated ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]] with [[monopoly|monopolistic]] [[corporation]]s; and intense and often violent conflict between workers and capitalists, thus claiming that measures were needed to address these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The term is also now often used as shorthand for a more or less [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] way of looking at the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=So what exactly is 'progressive' in politics? |author=Brian Wheeler |work=BBC News |date=26 November 2010 |url=http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-11785483 |access-date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progressivism in philosophy and politics==

===From the Enlightenment to the Industrial Revolution===
[[Immanuel Kant]] identified progress as being a movement away from barbarism towards civilization. Eighteenth century philosopher and political scientist [[Marquis de Condorcet]] predicted that political progress would involve the disappearance of slavery, the rise of literacy, the lessening of inequalities between the sexes, reforms of harsh prisons and the decline of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Robert (1980). History of the Idea of Progress. New York: Basic Books. ch 5&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Modernity]]" or "modernization" was a key form of the idea of progress as promoted by [[Classical liberalism|classical liberals]] in the 19th and 20th centuries, who called for the rapid modernization of the economy and society to remove the traditional hindrances to [[free market]]s and [[Freedom of movement|free movements]] of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Joyce Appleby |author2=Lynn Hunt |author3=Margaret Jacob  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Telling the Truth about History |year=1995 |page=78 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=O0aCcnVcbZcC&amp;pg=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] was influential in promoting the [[Idea of Progress]] in European philosophy by emphasizing a [[Philosophy of history#Cyclical and linear history|linear-progressive conception of history]] and rejecting a cyclical conception of history. [[Karl Marx]] applied to his writings the [[Hegelianism|Hegelian]] conception of linear-progressive history, the modernization of the economy through industrialization, and criticisms of the social class structure of industrial capitalist societies. As industrialization grew, concerns over its effects grew beyond [[Marxism|Marxist]] and other radical critiques and became mainstream.

===Contemporary mainstream political conception===
In the late 19th century, a political view rose in popularity in the Western world that progress was being stifled by vast [[economic inequality]] between the rich and the poor, minimally regulated ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]] with out-of-control [[monopoly|monopolistic]] [[corporation]]s, intense and often violent conflict between workers and capitalists, and a need for measures to address these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[social liberalism|Modern liberalism]] was influenced by [[Liberalism|liberal]] philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]]'s conception of people being "progressive beings".&lt;ref&gt;Alan Ryan. ''The Making of Modern Liberalism''. P. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; British Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] developed [[Centre-right politics|progressive conservatism]] under "[[One nation conservatism|One Nation]]" [[Toryism]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Dunleavy, Paul Joseph Kelly, Michael Moran.

Second Edition. London, England, UK: Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode (Publishers) Ltd, 1967. Pp. 524.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly in Germany, Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] enacted various progressive [[social welfare]] measures out of conservative motivations to distance workers from the socialist movement and as humane ways to assist in maintaining the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Union Contributions to Labor Welfare Policy and Practice: Past, Present and Future. Routledge, 16, 2013. P172.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of [[social democracy]] have identified themselves as promoting the progressive cause.&lt;ref&gt;Henning Meyer, Jonathan Rutherford. The Future of European Social Democracy: Building the Good Society. Palgrave Macmillan, 2012. P108.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Catholic Church]] encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' issued by [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1891, condemned the exploitation of labour and urged support for labour unions, government regulation of businesses in the interests of social justice, while upholding the rights of private property and criticizing socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Faith Jaycox. The Progressive Era. New York, New York: Infobase Publishing, 2005. P85.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Protestantism|Protestant]] progressive outlook called the [[Social Gospel]] emerged in North America that focused on challenging economic exploitation and poverty, and by the mid-1890s the Social Gospel was common in many Protestant theological seminaries in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Faith Jaycox. The Progressive Era. New York, New York: Infobase Publishing, 2005. P84.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892, during a major political contest between landlords and tenants, the landlord advocates were known as the "moderates" and the  [[land value tax]] reformers were known as the "progressives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Alfred S.|title=The Quarterly Register of Current History; Volume 2: The Year of 892|date=1893|publisher=Current History Publishing Company|location=Detroit|page=40|url=https://archive.org/details/cyclopedicreview02bostuoft|accessdate=23 February 2016|quote = The landlord element style themselves "Moderates," and the tenant element are known as "Progressives."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, progressivism began as a social movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and grew into a political movement, in what was known as the [[Progressive Era]].  While the term "American progressives" represent a range of diverse political pressure groups (not always united), some American progressives rejected [[Social Darwinism]], believing that the problems society faced (poverty, violence, greed, racism, class warfare) could best be addressed by providing good education, a safe environment, and an efficient workplace. Progressives lived mainly in the cities, were college educated, and believed that government could be a tool for change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/progressive-era.cfm he Progressive Era (1890 - 1920)], The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project (retrieved 31 September 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; American President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] of the US [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and later the US [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] declared that he "always believed that wise progressivism and wise conservatism go hand in hand".&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Lurie. William Howard Taft: The Travails of a Progressive Conservative. New York, New York, U.S.: Cambridge University Press, 2012. p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; American President [[Woodrow Wilson]] was also a member of the American progressive movement within the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

Progressive stances have evolved over time. In the late 19th century, for example, certain progressives argued for [[scientific racism]] on the grounds that it had a scientific basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
