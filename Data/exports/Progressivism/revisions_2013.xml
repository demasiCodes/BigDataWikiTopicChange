{{Progressivism}}

'''Progressivism''' is a general [[political philosophy]] based on the [[Idea of Progress]] that asserts that advances in science, technology, economic development, and social organization, can improve the [[human condition]]. Progressivism became highly significant during the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in [[Europe]] out of the belief that Europe was demonstrating that societies could progress in civility from barbaric conditions to civilization through strengthening the basis of [[empirical evidence|empirical knowledge]] as the foundation of society.&lt;ref name="Harold Mah 1914. p157"&gt;Harold Mah. Enlightenment Phantasies: Cultural Identity in France and Germany, 1750-1914. Cornell University. (2003). p157.&lt;/ref&gt; Figures of the Enlightenment believed that progress had [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]] application to all societies and that these ideas would spread from Europe to across the world.&lt;ref name="Harold Mah 1914. p157"/&gt; Sociologist [[Robert Nisbet]] finds that "No single idea has been more important than...the Idea of Progress in Western civilization for three thousand years." and defines five "crucial premises" of Idea of Progress as being: value of the past, nobility of Western civilization, worth of economic/technological growth, faith in reason and scientific/scholarly knowledge obtained through reason, intrinsic importance and worth of life on earth.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Robert (1980). History of the Idea of Progress. New York: Basic Books. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]] identified progress as being a movement away from barbarism towards civilization. 18th century philosopher and political scientist [[Marquis de Condorcet]] pre­dicted that political progress would involve the disappearance of slavery, the rise of literacy, the lessening of in­equalities between the sexes, reforms of harsh prisons and the decline of poverty.&lt;ref&gt; Nisbet, Robert (1980). History of the Idea of Progress. New York: Basic Books. ch 5&lt;/ref&gt; "Modernity" or "modernization" was a key form of the idea of progress as promoted by [[classical liberals]] in the 19th and 20th centuries, who called for the rapid modernization of the economy and society to remove the traditional hindrances to free markets and free movements of people.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Appleby, Lynn Hunt, and Margaret Jacob, ''Telling the Truth about History'' (1995) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] was influential in promoting the idea of progress in European philosophy by emphasizing a linear-progressive conception of history and rejecting cyclical conception of history. [[Karl Marx]] applied the Hegelian conception of linear-progressive history, the modernization of the economy through industrialization, and criticisms of the social class structure of industrial capitalist societies, to develop the ideology of [[communism]]. As industrialization grew, concerns over its effects grew beyond Marxist and other radical critiques and became mainstream.

Contemporary progressivism emerged as part of a response to the vast social changes brought by [[industrialization]] in the [[Western world]] in the late 19th century, particularly out of the view that progress was being stifled by vast [[economic inequality]] between the rich and the poor, unregulated ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]] with out-of-control [[monopoly|monopolistic]] [[corporation]]s, intense and often violent conflict between workers and capitalists, and lack of effort by governments to address these problems.&lt;ref name="nugent"&gt;{{cite book | title=Progressivism: A Very Short Introduction | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Nugent, Walter | year=2010 | isbn=9780195311068| pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Progressivism has influenced various political movements. [[social liberalism|Modern liberalism]] was influenced by [[Liberalism|liberal]] philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]]'s conception of people being "progressive beings".&lt;ref&gt;Alan Ryan. ''The Making of Modern Liberalism''. P. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; British Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] developed [[progressive conservatism]] under "[[One nation conservatism|One Nation]]" [[Toryism]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Dunleavy, Paul Joseph Kelly, Michael Moran. ''British Political Science: Fifty Years of Political Studies''. Oxford, England, UK; Malden, Massachusetts, USA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2000. Pp. 107-108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Blake. Disraeli. Second Edition. London, England, UK: Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode (Publishers) Ltd, 1967. Pp. 524.&lt;/ref&gt; A progressive political movement emerged in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in what was known as the [[Progressive Era]] with support amongst conservatives and liberals. American President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] of the US [[Republican Party of the United States|Republican Party]] and later the US [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] declared that he "always believed that wise progressivism and wise conservatism go hand in hand".&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Lurie. William Howard Taft: The Travails of a Progressive Conservative. New York, New York, USA: Cambridge University Press, 2012. p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; American President [[Woodrow Wilson]] was also a member of the American progressive movement within the [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democratic Party]]. 

Progressive stances have evolved over time. In the late 19th century, there were progressives who accepted [[scientific racism]] on the grounds of it having a scientific basis; however, this was later discarded as a result of racism being demonstrated to not have a scientific basis.&lt;ref name="nugent"&gt;{{cite book | title=Progressivism: A Very Short Introduction | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Nugent, Walter | year=2010 | isbn=9780195311068| pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stances towards [[imperialism]] were initially divided amongst progressives in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the United States where some progressives supported American imperialism while others opposed it.&lt;ref name="nugent"&gt;{{cite book | title=Progressivism: A Very Short Introduction | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Nugent, Walter | year=2010 | isbn=9780195311068| pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to [[World War I]], progressive American President Woodrow Wilson's [[Fourteen Points]] established the concept of national [[self-determination]] and criticized imperialist competition and colonial injustices; these views were supported by [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialists]] in areas of the world that were resisting imperial rule.&lt;ref&gt;Reconsidering Woodrow Wilson: Progressivism, Internationalism, War, and Peace. P. 309.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The '''Progressive Movement''' began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in cities with settlement workers and reformers who were interested in helping those facing harsh conditions at home and at work. The reformers spoke out about the need for laws regulating tenement housing and child labor. They also called for better working conditions for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's Trade Union League of Chicago Collection: An inventory of its records at the University of Illinois at Chicago|url=http://www.uic.edu/depts/lib/specialcoll/services/rjd/findingaids/WTULb.html|publisher=University of Illinois at Chicago|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also caused the development to [[progressive education]].

Political parties such as the [[Progressive Party 1912 (United States)|Progressive Party]] were organized at the start of the 20th century, and progressivism was embraced in the administrations of American presidents [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] and [[Lyndon Baines Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/pr/progrsvsm.html | title =Progressivism | work = | publisher =The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001-05. | accessdate =2006-11-18}}{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in [[Europe]] and [[Canada]], the term "progressive" has occasionally been used by groups not particularly left-wing. The [[Progressive Democrats]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]] took the name "progressivism" despite being considered centre-right or [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]]. The [[European Progressive Democrats]] was a mainly heterogeneous political group in the [[European Union]].

==By country==

===Australia===
In the past few years, the term "progressive" has been used in Australia to refer to what used to be called "The [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]]." {{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The term is popular in Australia, and it is often used in place of "social liberal." The term "liberalism" has become associated with free markets and small government; in other words "[[classical liberalism]]." Progressivism is used to differentiate between the [[Two-party system|two-party]] political system of the classical-economic liberal Liberal Party{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} and the protectionist-working class Labor Party. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The [[Australian Greens]] represent the third largest political party in the country, polling around 12%&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newspoll.com.au/cgi-bin/polling/display_poll_data.pl&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://au.acnielsen.com/news/200512.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; with 9 senators and one newly elected member of the Australian House of Representatives (elected in the 2010 Australian federal election). The party espouses progressive ideologies, together with [[grassroots democracy]] and [[participatory democracy]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Canada===
Western Canada began to receive an influx of political ideas at the end of the 19th century. The [[Progressive Party of Canada]] was founded in 1920 by [[Thomas Crerar]], a former [[Minister of Agriculture (Canada)|Minister of Agriculture]] in the [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Unionist]] government of [[Robert Borden]]. Crerar quit the Borden cabinet in 1919 because Minister of Finance Thomas White introduced a budget that Crerar felt did not pay sufficient attention to farmers' issues. Crerar became the first leader of the Progressive Party, and he led it to win 65 seats in the [[Canadian federal election, 1921|1921 general election]], placing second (ahead of the well-established Conservative Party).  The Progressives also had a close alignment with the provincial [[United Farmers of Canada|United Farmers]] parties in several provinces.  However, the Progressives were not able to hold their caucus together well, and progressive-leaning MPs and voters soon deserted the Progressives for the [[Liberals (Canada)|Liberals]] and the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (later the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Dating back to 1854, Canada's oldest political party was the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]].  Following that party's disastrous showing in the [[Canadian federal election, 1935|1935 election]] during the depths of the [[Great Depression in Canada|Great Depression]], the party was leaderless and lacked new ideas.  The party drafted [[Manitoba]] [[Premier (Canada)|Premier]] [[John Bracken]], a long-time leader of that province's progressive "United Farmers" party, who agreed to become leader of the Conservatives on condition that the party add ''Progressive'' to its name.  The party adopted the name "[[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]]", which it kept until its dissolution in 2003.  Despite the name change, most former Progressives continued to support other parties.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

During the debate over the merger of the Progressive Conservatives and the Alliance (2003), the meaning of the word caused contention again.  Since the Tories have stopped using the word "progressive" in their name federally, it has been used as a synonym for "centrist and centre left".  This has been apparent in the debate on a possible merger between the NDP and the Liberals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heath|first=Jamey|title=NDP must cooperate with all progressive forces|url=http://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/2012/03/08/ndp_must_cooperate_with_all_progressive_forces.html|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=Mar 08 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in discussions of strategic voting among leftist voters.

At the provincial level in [[Alberta]], the "progressive" element of the PCs was used in advertisements by [[Allison Redford]]'s leadership to attack the allegedly "regressive" nature of the [[Wildrose Party]] in the [[Alberta general election, 2012|2012 election]]. Liberal leader [[Raj Sherman]] challenged the PC's right to use the label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cryderman|first=Kelly|title=Sherman calls Redford’s "progressive" cred into question|url=http://blogs.calgaryherald.com/2012/04/12/sherman-calls-redfords-progressive-cred-into-question/|newspaper=Calgary Herald|date=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
In [[India]], there are a large number of state and national political parties. The [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) and the [[United Progressive Alliance]] (UPA) are the two political alliances in India, previously composed of leftist political parties that lean toward [[socialism]] and/or [[communism]], but since economic reforms took place in 1991 both national parties have established themselves as right wing reformists which lean toward more [[capitalism]]. Thus, the definition of "progressivism" may be interpreted differently in India, as communism was not a branch of thought that played any major role in the original western progressive movement. Furthermore, on a social level, the leftist parties in India do not espouse policies that would be considered progressive in the West, though policies in regards to the caste system, worker's rights, and women's rights are far more progressive than the non-progressive Indian parties. The [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] and the [[Indian National Congress]] are currently the chief members of the NDA and UPA coalitions respectively.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===New Zealand===
The [[New Zealand Progressive Party]], led by [[Jim Anderton]], states a particular focus on the creation of jobs, full employment, the environment, free education, free healthcare and raising the legal age of alcohol consumption to 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.progressive.org.nz/Policy/poilcy.html | title =Policies | work = | publisher =New Zealand Progressive Party | accessdate =2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was a junior member of the governing coalition in New Zealand from 2005 to 2008 during the second and third term of the [[fifth Labour Government of New Zealand]]. The coalition continues in opposition after the [[New Zealand general election, 2008|2008 election]].&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10543865"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz-election-2008/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501799&amp;objectid=10543865 |title=Anderton to stay with Labour, even in opposition |date=November 19, 2008 |agency=[[NZPA]] |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Progressive Green Party (New Zealand)|Progressive Green Party]] was formed in 1995 as an economically [[right-wing]] "[[Blue Greens|blue-green]]" environmentalist party. After a poor showing in the [[New Zealand general election, 1996|1996 election]], the Party did not contest any further elections. It is now disbanded.

===Ukraine===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Vitrenkoposter.jpeg|thumb| [[Nataliya Vitrenko]]'s 2004 election poster.]] --&gt;
The [[Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine]] (''Prohresivna Sotsjalistychna Partiya Ukrayiny/Progressivnaya Sotsialističeskaja Partiya Ukrajiny'', Прогресивна соціалістична партія України) is a [[political party]] in [[Ukraine]], created by [[Nataliya Vitrenko]], a flamboyant former member of the [[Socialist Party of Ukraine]] in 1995. The Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine is a radical left-wing populist party that supports integration with [[Russia]] and [[Belarus]] as an alternative to the [[European Union]]. PSPU traditionally campaigns on an anti-NATO, anti-IMF and pro-Russian platform. During the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 1998|1998 parliamentary elections]] the party got 4% of the vote, and its candidate for the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 1999|1999 presidential elections]], Nataliya Vitrenko, came in fourth. She received 10.97% of the vote in the first round.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In the [[legislative]] [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2002|2002 parliamentary election]], the party established the Nataliya Vitrenko Bloc alliance, including the ''Partija Osvitjan Ukrajiny''. It received 3.22% of the votes, below the 4% threshold needed to enter the [[Verkhovna Rada]]. PSPU was a vocal opponent of President [[Leonid Kuchma]] but supported [[Viktor Yanukovych]], Ukrainian prime minister since 2002, during the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential elections]]. After the [[Orange Revolution]] of 2004, the party joined the opposition to the new president [[Viktor Yushchenko]] in a coalition with the "[[Derzhava (Ukrainian party)|Derzhava]]" (State) party led by former Ukrainian prosecutor [[Gennady Vasilyev]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2006|2006 parliamentary elections]], the party again failed to gain seats in the parliament, participating as [[People's Opposition Bloc of Natalia Vitrenko]]. At the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2007|2007 parliamentary elections]] the party failed once more to enter the parliament.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===United Kingdom===
In the UK there are several parties who claim to be progressive, including the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[Liberal Democrats]], the [[Scottish National Party]], [[Plaid Cymru]] and the [[Green Party of England and Wales]]. The current coalition between the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and the [[Liberal Democrats]] also claims to be progressive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11785483 So what exactly is 'progressive' in politics?]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
{{See also|Politics of Scotland}}

The [[Progressives (Scotland)|Progressive Party]] was the name of a defunct municipal political organisation that operated in [[Scottish local government]] in the 20th century based around the [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Unionist Party]], [[Scottish Liberals]] and [[Independent (politician)|Independents]].  The [[Scottish Progressives]], a party with the same registered name as the defunct party, was also established in 2007.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

National political parties were rarely active in local politics, but the rise of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] led to a process of party [[politicisation]] of private government. At first Labour were opposed by the Progressives before other national political parties entered local government elections on a significant scale.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The Progressives formed as a loose alliance of unofficial [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]], [[Unionism in Scotland|Unionists]] and independents. Apart from a distinct focus on their urban localities, the essence of the Progressive groupings was opposition to Labour policies and control, plus a desire to avoid splitting the anti-Labour vote.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Progressive groupings formed in [[Edinburgh]] in 1928 and [[Glasgow]] in 1936 before spreading to other cities and towns. Their members were mainly drawn from [[small business]]men opposed to the introduction of what they saw as [[municipal socialism]] and Labour control. They dominated Scottish local politics for almost 50 years and as late as 1972 [[Edinburgh Council|Edinburgh council]] was made up of 21 Progressives, 9 Conservatives, 33 Labour and 5 Liberals.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===United States===
{{Main|Progressivism in the United States}}
[[File:President Theodore Roosevelt, 1904.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Theodore Roosevelt]] (1858-1919) was a leader in the [[Progressive Era]].]]
In the [[United States]] there have been several periods where progressive political parties have developed. The first of these was around the start of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Cocks, Peter C. Holloran and Alan Lessoff. ''Historical Dictionary of the Progressive Era'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; This period notably included the emergence of the [[Progressive Party 1912 (United States)|Progressive Party]], founded in 1912 by President Theodore Roosevelt. This progressive party was the most successful third party in modern American history.&lt;!-- Populists with W.B. Jennings? --&gt; The [[Progressive Party 1924 (United States)|Progressive Party founded in 1924]] and the [[Progressive Party 1948 (United States)|Progressive Party founded in 1948]] were less successful than the 1912 version. There are also two notable state progressive parties: the [[Wisconsin Progressive Party]] and the [[Vermont Progressive Party]]. The latter is still in operation and currently has several positions in state government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Legacy of Progressive Leadership|url=http://www.progressiveparty.org/organize/legacy|publisher=The Vermont Progressive Party|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, members of the [[Green Party of the United States]] are most likely to self-identify as liberal progressives. In the U.S. Congress, the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]] is the most liberal wing of the Democratic Party, and it is often in opposition to the more [[centrist]] or conservative Democrats who form the [[Blue Dog Coalition|Blue Dogs]] caucus. It is also in near-continuous opposition to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} However, some long time Republicans have spoken out for more steeply [[progressive taxation]] than their leadership has supported, including [[Bruce Bartlett]], [[Paul O'Neill (Secretary of the Treasury)|Paul O'Neill]], [[David Stockman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deficits: The Battle Over Taxing The Rich|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2102-18560_162-6999906.html|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sheila Bair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bair|first=Sheila|title=Grand Old Parity|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/opinion/republicans-must-bridge-the-income-gap.html?_r=0|accessdate=25 March 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Republican ''Wall Street Journal'' opinion columnist [[Peggy Noonan]] has called for a renewed focus on jobs instead of debt and deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Noonan|first=Peggy|title=The Anti-Confidence Man|url=http://www.peggynoonan.com/article.php?article=665|accessdate=25 March 2013|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=March 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to other political ideologies==

===Liberalism===
{{globalize|date=October 2013}}
The term "progressive" is today often used in place of "[[Liberalism|liberal]]".{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Although the two are related in some ways, they are separate and distinct political ideologies. In the U.S. in particular, the term "progressive" tends to have the same value as the European term [[Social democracy|social democrat]], which is scarcely used in American political language.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The reason for this confusion in the U.S. might partly be rooted in the political spectrum being two-dimensional; [[social liberalism]] is a tenet of modern progressivism, whereas [[economic liberalism]] (and its associated [[deregulation]]) is not. According to John Halpin, senior advisor on the staff of the center-left [[Center for American Progress]], "Progressivism is an orientation towards politics. It's not a long-standing ideology like liberalism, but an historically-grounded concept... that accepts the world as dynamic." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.alternet.org/wiretap/23706/?comments=view&amp;cID=25252&amp;pID=22606 | title =What Is Progressivism? | format = | work = | publisher =Andrew Garib | accessdate =2006-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cultural liberalism]]{{Clarify|date=August 2010}} is ultimately founded on the belief that the major purpose of the government is to protect rights. Liberals are often called "[[left-wing]]", in contrast to "[[right-wing]]" conservatives. The progressive school, as a unique branch of contemporary political thought, tends to advocate certain center-left or left-wing views that may conflict with mainstream liberal views, despite the fact that modern liberalism and progressivism may still both support many of the same policies (such as the concept of war as a general last resort).{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

American progressives tend to advocate [[progressive taxation]] and oppose what they describe as the growing and negative influence of large corporations. Progressives are typically in agreement on an international scale with left-liberalism in that they support organized labor and [[trade union]]s, they usually wish to introduce a [[living wage]], and they often support the creation of a [[universal health care]] system. In the [[United States]], liberals and progressives are often conflated, and in general are the primary voters of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] which has a "large tent" policy, combining similar if not congruent ideologies into large voting blocs.  Many progressives also support the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] or local parties such as the [[Vermont Progressive Party]].  In [[Canada]], liberals usually support the national [[Liberal Party (Canada)|Liberal Party]] while progressives usually support the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]], which traditionally has had provincial electoral success in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, and since the recent federal election, in Quebec.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}
