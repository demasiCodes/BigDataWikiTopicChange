This term is preferred by many over the more traditional label in American politics, [[liberal]], because of the frequent association of '[[liberal]]' with the centrist politics of many Democratic Party politicians (such as Al Gore) in recent years.  The term "progressive" is thus used to avoid confusion between centrist and genuinely left-wing views.

The term has its origin in American politics in the early part of the twentieth century.  During this period, known as the [[Progressive Era]], many reforms were enacted.  Some third-party presidential candidates ran for office during this time under the Progressive Pary label, notably Robert LaFollette.</rev></revisions></page></pages></query></api>
