'''Ableism''' is a [[neologism]] of [[United States]] coinage used to describe effective [[discrimination]] against people with disabilities in favor of people who are not [[disabled]]. An ''ableist'' society is said to be one that treats non-disabled individuals as the standard of ‘normal living’, which results in public and private places and services, education, and social work that are built to serve 'standard' people, thereby inherently excluding those with various disabilities. By contrast with the US, [[United Kingdom]] usage favours 'Disablism' to describe the same processes. Other [[English language|English]]-speaking nations may use either term or both.

==The ‘traditional model’ in myths, literature, theatre, folklore, biography and history&lt;ref name = "ableist model"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://attitudes2disability.wordpress.com/2007/02/27/the-traditional-model/|author= |title=ableist model|date=last modified 2007|publisher=wordpress|accessdate=2009-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;==

Traditionally, in many cultures around the world, people with physical, sensory or mental impairments were thought of as under the spell of witchcraft, possessed by demons, or as penitent sinners, being punished by God for wrong-doing by themselves or their parents. Ancient societies used to place deformed or otherwise disabled babies upon concrete slabs outdoors exposed to storms and other harsh elements, thus killing them gradually over the course of a few days.

With the Age of Enlightenment in the 18th century, came a more scientific understanding of the causes of impairment and, with it, a sense of confidence in medical science’s ability to cure, or at least rehabilitate, disabled people. Some disabled people (often for social or political reasons) were deemed incurable and placed in long-stay institutions and special schools (or, today, in day-care centres). A notion of ‘normality’ was invested with great pseudo-scientific significance. It was based on assessments of impairments from a deficit point of view against normality: what one cannot do, instead of what one can do. This has been called ‘medical model’ (or ‘individual model’) thinking by the Disabled People’s Movement over the last 30 years. This is not to deny the very necessary role of medical science in keeping many disabled people alive, and reducing their pain and discomfort, but it is to argue that disabled people should not be reduced to just their impairments.

The ‘medical model’ sees disabled people as the problem. They need to be adapted to fit into the world as it is. If this isn’t possible, then they should be shut away in a specialised institution or isolated at home, where only their most basic needs are met. The emphasis is on dependence, backed up by the stereotypes of disability that bring out pity, fear and patronising attitudes. Usually, the impairment is focused on, rather than the needs of the person. The power to change disabled people seems to lie with the medical and associated professions, with their talk of cures, normalisation and science. Often, disabled people’s lives are handed over to these professionals. Their decisions affect where disabled people go to school; what support they get; where they live; what benefits they are entitled to; whether they can work; and even, at times, whether they are born at all, or allowed to have children themselves.

In addition, the Disability Movement points out how the built environment imposes further limitations on disabled people. Medical model thinking would say these problems are due to the disabled person’s lack of rehabilitation. The Disability Movement perceives the difficulties disabled people experience as the barriers that disable them and curtail their life chances. These difficulties include in school and higher education, in finding work and suitable work environments, accessing leisure and entertainment facilities, using private and public transport, obtaining suitable housing, or in their personal, family and social life.

Powerful and pervasive medical model views are reinforced in the media, books, films, comics, art and language. Many disabled people internalise negative views of themselves and develop feelings of low self-esteem and underachievement, which reinforce non-disabled people’s assessments of their worth. The medical model, plus the built environment and social attitudes it creates, lead to a cycle of dependency and exclusion which is difficult to break. This thinking predominates in filmmaking, leisure, work and education. In schools, for instance, special educational needs are considered the problem of the individual, who is seen as different, faulty and needing to be assessed and made as ‘normal’ as possible.

==Disablism==

As noted above, 'disablism' rather than 'ableism' is the term favoured in the United Kingdom, this usage flows out of a perspective driven by the [[Social model of disability]] which regards 'disability' as the discrimination experienced by a person as a response to their impairment, making 'disablist' or 'disablism' the logical terms to describe discrimination on the grounds of disability. It is also discrimination of people who are disabled.

==Discrimination==
The presumption that everyone is non-disabled is said to encourage environments that are inaccessible to disabled people. It is a system by which mainstream society denigrates, devalues, and thus oppresses those with disabilities, while privileging those without disabilities, according to those who describe ableist circumstances.

In extreme cases, morality, worth and intelligence may even be equated to being able-bodied or able-minded, while disability is [[conflated]] with immorality, stupidity, and worthlessness, and disabled lives may be devalued to the point that many in the society believe that one is better off dead than living with disability.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  The [[eugenics]] movement of the 19th and 20th centuries, which took its most extreme form in Nazi Germany with [[Action T4]], was a product of this belief, and some believe the ‘[[right to die]]’ movement is also an outgrowth of ableist beliefs&lt;ref name = "Teaching for diversity and social justice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=1587Y2cwSjkC&amp;pg=PA354&amp;lpg=PA354&amp;dq=ableist+%27right+to+die%27&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=f37uibygvv&amp;sig=d3N3DWeMzkCLWwWnx_Nv6BUhTwg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-hPTSuiZMJHIlAeZh6GpCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|author= "Maurianne Adams, Lee Anne Bell, Pat Griffin"|title=Teaching for diversity and social justice|date=last modified 2007|publisher=CRC Press|accessdate=2009-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

===Laws against discrimination===
In the U.S., Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] of 1990 (ADA) enacted into law certain [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] penalties for failing to make a public places comply with access codes known as the ADA Access Guidelines (ADAAG); this law also helped expand the use of certain adaptive devices, such as TTYs (phone systems for the deaf/speech impaired), some [[computer]]-related hardware and software, and [[ramps]] or lifts on [[public transportation]] [[bus]]es and private automobiles. 

In the UK, meanwhile, the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995|1995 Disability Discrimination Act]] and [[Disability Discrimination Act 2005]] attempts the same. 

These laws often concentrate mainly on the [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] or legal aspect of disability discrimination and neglect the [[cultural]] dimensions that are integral to the [[social model of disability]].

==Inclusion==
''[[inclusion (disability rights)|Inclusion]]'', comparatively, means that all products, services, and societal opportunities and resources are fully accessible, welcoming, functional and usable for as many different types of abilities as reasonably possible. An ''ableist'' society tends towards [[isolation]], [[pity]], paternalism and low [[self-esteem]] among people with disabilities, whereas an ''inclusive'' society tends toward sociability and interdependency between the able-bodied and disabled.
