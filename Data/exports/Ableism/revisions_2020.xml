'''Ableism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|b|ə|l|ɪ|z|əm}}; also known as '''ablism''',&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University Press, "Oxford Dictionaries Online: 'ableism'", ''Oxford Dictionaries Online'', Retrieved 12 March 201h.&lt;/ref&gt; '''disablism''' (Brit. English), '''anapirophobia''', '''anapirism''', and '''disability discrimination''') is [[discrimination]] and social [[prejudice]] against people with [[Disability|disabilities]] and/or people who are perceived to have disabilities. Ableism characterizes persons who are defined by their disabilities as inferior to the non-disabled.&lt;ref&gt;Linton, Simi (1998). ''Claiming Disability Knowledge and Identity''. New York: New York University Press. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, people are assigned or denied certain perceived abilities, skills, or [[character orientation]]s.

Although ableism and disablism are both terms which describe disability discrimination, the emphasis for each of these terms is slightly different. Ableism is discrimination in favor of non-disabled people. Disablism is discrimination against disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Disablism and ableism {{!}} Disability charity Scope UK|url=https://www.scope.org.uk/about-us/disablism/|access-date=2020-11-21|website=Scope|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are stereotypes, generally inaccurate, which are either associated with disability in general, or they are associated with specific disabilities (for instance the presumption that all disabled people want to be cured, the presumption that wheelchair  users also have an intellectual disability or the presumption that blind people have some special form of insight).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://disability-studies.leeds.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/library/Sutherland-CHAPTER6.pdf|title=Sutherland, A.T. 'Disabled We Stand', Chapter 6 'Stereotypes of Disability', Souvenir Press, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[stereotype]]s, in turn, serve as a justification for ableist practices and reinforce discriminatory [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and [[behavior]]s toward people who are disabled.&lt;ref&gt;Wüllenweber, Ernst; Theunissen, Georg; Mühl, Heinz (2006).

In ableist societies, people with disabilities are considered less valuable, or they are even seen as expendable. The [[eugenics]] movement of the early 20th century is considered an expression of widespread ableism.

Ableism can also be better understood by reading literature which is written and published by those who experience disability and ableism first-hand. [[Disability studies|Disability Studies]] is an academic discipline which is also beneficial when non-disabled people pursue it in order to gain a better understanding of ableism.

==Etymology==
Originating from ''-able'' (in disable, disabled) and ''[[-ism]]'' (in [[racism]], [[sexism]]); its first known use occurred in 1985–1990. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ableism|title=Definition of ABLEISM|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=1 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com|ableism|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Canada ===
Ableism in Canada refers to a set of discourses, behaviors, and structures that express feelings of anxiety, fear, [[hostility]], and [[antipathy]] towards people with disabilities in [[Canadian people|Canada]].

The specific types of [[discrimination]] that have occurred or are still occurring in Canada include the inability to access important facilities such as infrastructure within the [[transportation|transport]] network, restrictive [[immigration policy|immigration policies]], [[involuntary sterilization]] to stop people with disabilities from having offspring, [[Employment discrimination|barriers to employment opportunities]], [[wage]]s that are insufficient to maintain a minimal [[standard of living]], and [[involuntary commitment|institutionalization]] of people with disabilities in substandard conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Policy on ableism and discrimination based on disability |url=http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-ableism-and-discrimination-based-disability |publisher=Ontario Human Rights Commission |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Austerity measure]]s implemented by the [[government of Canada]] have also at times been referred to as ableist, such as funding cuts that put people with disabilities at risk of [[Substandard housing|living in abusive arrangements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/austerity-left-people-with-disabilities-without-housing-n-s-inquiry-told|title='Ableist' bias left people with disabilities without housing, N.S. inquiry told|date=4 June 2018|work=National Post|accessdate=26 August 2018|first=Michael|last=Tutton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nazi Germany ===
In 1939 [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] signed the secret euthanasia program decree, [[Aktion T4]], which authorized the killing of selected patients diagnosed with chronic neurological and psychiatric disorders. This program killed about 70,000 people with disabilities before it was officially halted by Hitler in 1941 under public pressure, and it was unofficially continued out of the public eye, killing a total of 200,000 or more by the end of Hitler's reign in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/T4-Program|title=T4 Program{{snd}} Definition and History|author=|date=|website=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|access-date=1 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

Ableist and eugenicist ideas were often found in suffrage rhetoric.]]

In the UK, disability discrimination became unlawful as a result of the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]], and the [[Disability Discrimination Act 2005]]. These were later superseded, retaining the substantive law, by the [[Equality Act 2010]]. The [[Equality Act 2010]] brought together protections against multiple areas of discriminatory behavior (disability, race, religion and belief, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, age and pregnancy{{snd}} the so-called 'protected characteristics').{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} 

Under EA2010 there are prohibitions addressing several forms of discrimination: direct discrimination (s.13(1) [[Equality Act 2010]]), indirect discrimination (s.6 and s.19 [[Equality Act 2010]], [[harassment]] (s.26 [[Equality Act 2010]]), [[victimisation]] (s.27(2) Equality Act 2010), discrimination arising from disability (s.15(1) [[Equality Act 2010]] and failure to make reasonable adjustments (s.20 [[Equality Act 2010]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Part 2, Chapter 1, Section 6, of the [[Equality Act 2010]] states that:

“A person P has a disability if

(a) P has a physical or mental impairment, and

(b) the impairment has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on P's ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.“

(Please note that as with any English, for the purposes of the interpretation of the Equality Act 2010, and, for the purposes of righteousness, both phonetically and otherwise derived undertones apparently implied by the nomenclature and numbering manifest in the phrase “Part 2, Chapter 1, Section 6” as well as in the abbreviated “P” which takes the place of “person” in the document, are irrelevant.)

===United States===
Before the 1800s, the perspective of disability was often from a religious point of view. Individuals with disability were seen as evil or possessed by the devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/ableism123edu/history|title=History Perspective of Ableism in America |last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=looks to be a self-published site?|date=June 2018}} Much like many minority groups, disabled Americans were often [[wikt:segregated|segregated]] and denied certain rights for a majority of American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://knightpoliticalreporting.syr.edu/?civilhistoryessays=a-civil-rights-history-americans-with-disabilities|title=A Civil Rights History: Americans with Disabilities|last=Faville|first=Andrea|date=|website=Knight Chair in Political Reporting|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1800s, a shift from a religious view to a more scientific view took place and caused more individuals with disabilities to be examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nccj.org/ableism|title=Ableism|last=|first=|date=|website=NCCJ |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public stigma began to change after [[World War II]] when many Americans returned home with disabilities and physical handicaps. In the 1960s, following the [[civil rights movement]] in America, the world began the [[Disability rights movement|disabled rights movement]]. The movement was intended to give all individuals with disabilities equal rights and opportunities. Until the 1970s, ableism in the United States was often codified into law. For example, in many jurisdictions, so-called "[[ugly law]]s" barred people from appearing in public if they had diseases or disfigurements that were considered unsightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rootedinrights.org/the-ugly-laws-disability-in-public/|title=The Ugly Laws: Disability In Public|author=|date=6 September 2011|website=rootedinrights.org|access-date=1 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ====
Section 504 and other sections of the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]] enacted into law certain [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] penalties for failing to make public places comply with access codes known as the ADA Access Guidelines (ADAAG). These laws prohibit direct discrimination against disabled people in government programs, employment, public transit, and public accommodations like stores and restaurants.

==== Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act of 1984====
The [[Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act]] was passed to promote the fundamental right to vote by improving access for [[handicapped]] and [[elderly]] individuals to registration facilities and polling places for Federal elections by requiring access to polling places used in [[Federal elections in the United States|Federal elections]] and available registration and voting aids, such as instructions in large type &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ada.gov/cguide.htm|title=A Guide to Disability Rights Laws|author=|date=|website=www.ADA.gov|access-date=1 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 ====
The federal [[Fair Housing Act (United States)|Fair Housing Amendments Act]] of 1988 prohibits housing discrimination on the basis of mental or physical disability and requires that newly constructed multi-family housing meet certain access guidelines while requiring landlords to allow disabled persons to modify existing dwellings for accessibility. The law also protects people with mental disabilities by prohibiting discrimination in housing and allowing people with mental illness or any other disability to live where they choose.

==== Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ====
The [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA) was passed on July 26, 1990, during the [[George H. W. Bush]] administration and amended on January 1, 2009. The act gave individuals with disabilities civil rights protections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ada.gov|title=ADA.gov homepage|website=www.ada.gov|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ====
The [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) is a four-part (A-D) piece of American legislation that ensures students with a disability are provided with [[Free Appropriate Public Education]] (FAPE) that is tailored to their individual needs. IDEA was previously known as the [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]] (EHA) from 1975 to 1990. In 1990, the United States Congress reauthorized EHA and changed the title to IDEA (Public Law No. 94-142). Overall, the goal of IDEA is to provide children with disabilities the same opportunity for education as those students who do not have a disability.

== Workplace ==

In 1990, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]] was put in place to prohibit private employers, state and local government, employment agencies and labor unions from discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities in job applications, when hiring, firing, advancement in workplace, compensation, training, and on other terms, conditions and privileges of employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ada.gov/ada_title_I.htm|title=Employment (Title I)|author=|date=|website=www.ADA.gov|access-date=1 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], also known as the EEOC also plays a part in fighting against ableism by being responsible for enforcing federal laws that make it illegal to discriminate against a job applicant or an employee because of the person's race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/|title=About the EEOC: Overview|author=|date=|website=www.EEOC.gov|access-date=1 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite legislation to reduce disability discrimination, roughly 13.3 million Americans with disabilities report difficulty finding a job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/ableism123edu/facts|title=Facts About Institutional Ableism|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Healthcare ==
In England, Scotland and Wales it is permitted for an abortion to be performed on the basis of the foetus having physical or mental abnormalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Participation|first=Expert|title=Abortion Act 1967|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/87/data.htm|access-date=2020-06-17|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Schools ==
Ableism often makes the world unwelcoming, and inaccessible to people with disabilities - especially in schools. An ableist would assert that children with disabilities need to assimilate to the normative culture. For example, a student who experiences a disability needs to read text instead of listening to a tape recording of the text. In the past, schools have focused too much on fixing the disability, but due to progressive reforms, schools are now focused on minimizing the impact of a student’s disability, and giving support, skills, and more opportunities to live a full life. Moreover, schools are required to maximize access to their entire community.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.ed.gov/idea/about-idea/|title=About IDEA{{snd}} Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|author=|date=|website=ed.gov|access-date=1 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Congress made into law the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]], which states that free and appropriate education is eligible to children with disabilities with insurance of necessary services.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/feb07/vol64/num05/Confronting-Ableism.aspx|title=Confronting Ableism{{snd}} Educational Leadership|author=|date=|website=www.ascd.org|access-date=1 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress later amended the law, in 2015, to include the [[Every Student Succeeds Act]], which guarantees equal opportunity for people with disabilities full participation in society, and the tools for overall independent success.

== Media ==
Disabilities are not only misrepresented in the media but often underrepresented as well. While roughly 20 percent of the population is disabled, only 2 percent of characters played in television and film have a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rudermanfoundation.org/white_papers/the-ruderman-white-paper-on-the-challenge-to-create-more-authentic-disability-casting-and-representation-on-tv/|title=The Ruderman White Paper on the Challenge to Create More Authentic Disability Casting and Representation on TV|work=Ruderman Family Foundation|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 95 percent of the time, disabled characters are played by actors and actresses who are not disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Woodburn|first1=Danny |first2=Kristina |last2=Kopić|date= July 2016|title=The Ruderman White Paper on Employment of Actors with Disabilities in Television |url= http://www.rudermanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/TV-White-Paper_7-1-003.pdf |journal=Ruderman Family Foundation|volume= |pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These common ways of framing disability are heavily criticized for being dehumanizing and failing to place importance on the perspectives of persons with disabilities.

=== Disabled villain ===
One common form of media depiction of disability is to portray villains with a mental or physical disability. Lindsey Row-Heyveld notes, for instance, "that villainous pirates are scraggly, wizened, and inevitably kitted out with a peg leg, eye patch, or hook hand whereas heroic pirates look like [[Johnny Depp]]'s [[Jack Sparrow]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Row-Heyveld | first1 = Lindsey | year = 2015 | title = Reading Batman, Writing X-Men Superpowers and Disabilities in the First-Year Seminar | url = http://pedagogy.dukejournals.org/content/15/3/519.full.pdf | journal = Pedagogy: Critical Approaches to Teaching Literature, Language, Composition, and Culture | volume =  15| issue = | pages =  519–526| doi = 10.1215/15314200-2917105 | s2cid = 146299487 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The disability of the villain is meant to separate them from the average viewer and dehumanize the antagonist. As a result, stigma forms surrounding the disability and the individuals that live with it.

=== Inspiration porn ===
[[Inspiration porn]] is the use of people with disabilities performing ordinary tasks as a form of inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stella Young|Young, Stella]]. "Stella Young: I'm not your inspiration, thank you very much | TED Talk". TED.com. Retrieved 2015-08-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms of inspiration porn say that it distances people with disabilities from individuals who are not disabled and portrays disability as an obstacle to overcome or rehab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last =Rakowitz|first= Rebecca|title = Inspiration porn: A look at the objectification of the disabled community |work= The Crimson White|publisher=University of Alabama|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20161202121955/https://cw.ua.edu/article/2016/12/inspiration-porn-a-look-at-the-objectification-of-the-disabled-community|archive-date=2 December 2016|date = 1 December 2016|url = https://cw.ua.edu/article/2016/12/inspiration-porn-a-look-at-the-objectification-of-the-disabled-community|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Kate (17 July 2017). "On Inspiration Porn". ''Huffington Post''. Retrieved 5 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pitied character ===
In many forms of media such as films and articles a person who experiences disability is portrayed as a character who is viewed as less than able, different, and an "outcast." Hayes &amp; Black (2003) explore Hollywood films as the discourse of pity towards disability as a problem of social, physical, and emotional confinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hayes |first1=Michael |last2=Black |first2=Rhonda |title=Troubling Signs: Disability, Hollywood Movies and the Construction of a Discourse of Pity |journal=Disability Studies Quarterly |date=15 April 2003 |volume=23 |issue=2 |doi=10.18061/dsq.v23i2.419 |url=http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/419/585 |issn=2159-8371}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aspect of pity is heightened through the storylines of media focusing on the individual's weaknesses as opposed to strengths and therefore leaving audiences a negative and ableist portrayal towards disability.

=== Supercrip stereotype ===
The supercrip narrative is generally a story of a person with an apparent disability who is able to "overcome" their physical differences and somehow accomplish an impressive task. In Thomas Hehir's "Eliminating Ableism in Education," he uses the example of a blind man who climbs Mount Everest as an example of the supercrip narrative.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hehir|first=Thomas|date=2002|title=Eliminating Ableism in Education|url=http://hepgjournals.org/doi/10.17763/haer.72.1.03866528702g2105|journal=Harvard Educational Review|language=en|volume=72|issue=1|pages=1–33|doi=10.17763/haer.72.1.03866528702g2105|issn=0017-8055|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paralympics are another example of the supercrip stereotype, since they generate a large amount of media attention, and demonstrate disabled people doing extremely strenuous physical tasks. Although at face value, this may appear inspiring, Hehir explains that many people with disabilities can view these news stories as setting unrealistic expectations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, Hehir mentions that supercrip stories imply that disabled people are required to overcome their disabilities by performing these impressive tasks to be seen as an equal and avoid pity from those without disabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Sports ==

[[File:Paralympic Runner.jpg|thumb|A runner in the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games]]

Sports are often an area of society in which ableism is evident. In sports media, athletes with disabilities are often portrayed to be inferior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DePauw | first1 = K.
