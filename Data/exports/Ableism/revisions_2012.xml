'''Ableism''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|eɪ|b|ə|l|ɪ|z|ə|m}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ableism Dictionary.com ableism]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a form of [[discrimination]] or social prejudice against people with disabilities. It is known by many names, including '''disability discrimination''', '''physicalism''', '''handicapism''', and '''disability oppression'''.{{sfn|Griffin|Peters|Smith|2007|p=335}}  It is also sometimes known as '''disablism''', although there is some dispute as to whether ableism and disablism are synonymous, and some people within [[Disability rights movement|disability rights]] circles find the latter term's use inaccurate.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Discrimination faced by those who have or are perceived to have a [[mental disorder]] is sometimes called [[Mentalism (discrimination)|mentalism]] rather than ableism.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Definition==
Similar to many of the assumptions underlying the [[medical model of disability]] amongst many [[clinicians]], the "ableist" societal world-view is that the [[able-bodied]] are the norm in society, and that people who have disabilities must either strive to become that norm or should keep their distance from [[able-bodied]] people. A disability is thus, inherently, a "bad" thing that must be overcome. The ableist worldview holds that disability is an error, a mistake, or a failing, rather than a simple consequence of human diversity, akin to [[race (classification of humans)|race]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender]].{{sfn|Marshak|Dandeneau|Prezant|L'Amoreaux|2009|p=50}}

Campbell draws a distinction between disablism and ableism.  Disablism, she notes, has been the traditional focus of study within the field of [[disability studies]].  Disablism promotes the unequal treatment of the (physically) disabled versus the able-bodied.  It marks the disabled as the [[Other]], and works from the perspective of the able-bodied.{{sfn|Campbell|2009|pp=3&amp;ndash;4}}

Campbell acknowledges that the concept of ableism is, as of 2009, not clearly defined in the literature and has "limited definitional or conceptual specifity".{{sfn|Campbell|2009|p=5}} She herself distinguishes between ableism and disablism, defining the former as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A network of beliefs, processes and practices that produces a particular kind of self and body (the corporeal standard) that is projected as the perfect, species-typical, and therefore essential and fully human.  Disability is then cast as a diminished state of being human.{{sfn|Campbell|2009|p=5}}{{sfn|Campbell|2001|p=44}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other definitions of ableism include those of Chouinard, who defines it as "ideas, practices, institutions, and social relations that presume able-bodiedness, and by so doing, construct persons with disabilities as marginalized &amp;#91;&amp;hellip;&amp;#93; and largely invisible 'others'"{{sfn|Chouinard|1997|p=380}}{{sfn|Campbell|2009|p=5}} and Amundson and Taira, who define it as "a doctrine that falsely treats impairments as inherently and naturally horrible and blames the impairments themselves for the problems experienced by the people who have them".{{sfn|Amundson|Taira|2005|p=54}}{{sfn|Campbell|2009|p=5}}

Harpur argues that the term ableism is a powerful label that has the capacity to ameliorate the use of negative stereotypes and facilitate cultural change by focusing attention on the discriminator rather than on the victim or impairment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Harpur | first = Paul | title = Sexism and Racism, Why not Ableism?

==United Kingdom==

In the UK, disability discrimination became unlawful as a result of the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995|1995 Disability Discrimination Act]] and, later, the [[Disability Discrimination Act 2005]]. These were later repealed but the substantive law is replicated in the [[Equality Act 2010]]. Under the [[Equality Act 2010]] there are several types of discrimination that are prohibited. These are [[direct discrimination]] (s.13(1) [[Equality Act 2010]]), [[indirect discrimination]] (s.6 and s.19 [[Equality Act 2010]], [[harassment]] (s.26 [[Equality Act 2010]]), [[victimisation]] (s.27(2) [[Equality Act 2010]]), [[discrimination arising from disability]] (s.15(1) [[Equality Act 2010]]) and [[failure to make reasonable adjustments]] (s.20 [[Equality Act 2010]]).

The legal definition is disability is:

''"A person (P) has a disability if P has a physical or mental impairment, and the impairment has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on his ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities".'' (Section 6(1), [[Equality Act 2010]]) 

Some conditions (such as blindness, [[AIDS]] and cancer) are expressly included; others (such as drug and alcohol addictions) are expressly excluded.

Legal experts have suggested that this definition of disability may change as a result of a Danish case currently before the [[European Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lewissilkin.com/Journal/2012/October/Dicing-with-disability.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==USA==
In the US, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] of 1990 (ADA) enacted into law certain [[civil law (common law)|civil]] penalties for failing to make public places comply with access codes known as the ADA Access Guidelines (ADAAG); this law also helped expand the use of certain adaptive devices, such as TTYs (phone systems for the hearing/speech impaired), some [[computer]]-related hardware and software, and [[wheelchair ramp]]s or lifts on [[public transportation]] and private automobiles.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} 

However, none of these laws requires all buildings constructed before the date of the Act to be modified to fit the physical directives of the Act. Instead, these directives are applied to three general categories of buildings: existing government administration buildings and structures regardless of age; all newly-constructed buildings and structures; and significantly [[renovated]] and/or refurbished buildings and structures.

===California===
In addition to the federal protections provided by the ADA, California's Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) provides additional protections to California employees. Notably, FEHA applies to employers with 5 or more employees and offers more extensive protection than the ADA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mybossstinks.com/disability_discrimination.html |title=Disability Discrimination |publisher=Mybossstinks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
