Advocates of the term argue that ableism is, like [[racism]], and [[sexism]], a reaction of main-stream [[society]] on the derogatory physical or intellectual capacities in combination with behaviour of the disabled person.  An ''ableist'' society treats non-disabled people as the standard of ‘normal living’. This results in public and private places &amp; services, education and social work that are built to serve 'standard' people, excluding those with various disabilities.

In an ''inclusive'' society, on the other hand, all products and services are fully accessible and usable for as much people as possible. An ''ableist'' society tends to isolation, where an ''inclusive'' society tends to ''integration'' or ''[[inclusion]]''.
