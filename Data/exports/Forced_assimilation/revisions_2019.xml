'''Forced assimilation''' is an involuntary process of [[cultural assimilation]] of religious or [[ethnic]] [[minority group]]s during which they are forced to adopt [[language]], [[Identity (social science)|identity]], [[Social norm|norms]], [[mores]], [[Convention (norm)|customs]], [[tradition]]s, [[Value (ethics)|values]], [[mentality]], [[perception]]s, [[Lifestyle (sociology)|way of life]], and often [[Forced conversion|religion]] and [[ideology]] of established and generally larger [[community]] belonging to [[dominant culture]] by government. Also enforcement of a new language in legislation, [[education]], literature, worshiping counts as forced assimilation. Unlike [[ethnic cleansing]], the local population is not outright [[genocide]] and may or may not be forced to leave a certain area. Instead the population becomes assimilated by force. It has often been used after an area has changed nationality, often in the aftermath of war. Some examples are both the German and French forced assimilation in the provinces [[Alsace]] and (at least a part of) [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]], and some decades after the Swedish conquests of the Danish provinces [[Scania]], [[Blekinge]] and [[Halland]] the local population was submitted to forced assimilation. Forced assimilation is also called [[cultural genocide]] and [[ethnocide]].

==Forced ethnic assimilation==
{{see also|Ethnic group|Ethnic conflict}}
If a [[country|state]] puts extreme emphasis on a homogeneous [[national identity]], it may resort, especially in the case of minorities originating from historical foes, to harsh, even extreme measures to 'exterminate' the minority culture, sometimes to the point of considering the only alternative its physical elimination ([[Population transfer|expulsion]] or even [[genocide]]).

States, mostly based on the idea of nation, perceived the presence of ethnic or linguistic minorities as a danger for their own [[territorial integrity]]. In fact minorities could claim their own independence, or to be rejoined with their own motherland. The consequence was the weakening or disappearing of several ethnic minorities.  [[Forced migration]]s took place after each of the two [[world wars]].

The latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century saw the rise of [[nationalism]]. Previously, a country consisted largely of whatever peoples lived on the land that was under the dominion of a particular ruler. Thus, as principalities and kingdoms grew through conquest and marriage, a ruler could wind up with peoples of many different ethnicities under his dominion.  This also reflected the long history of migrations of different tribes and peoples through Europe.

The concept of nationalism was based on the idea of a "people" who shared a common bond through [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[religion]], [[language]] and [[culture]]. Furthermore, nationalism asserted that each "people" had a right to its own nation. Much of [[European history]] in the latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century can be understood as efforts to realign national boundaries with this concept of "one people, one nation". Such scenes also happened in [[Japan]] and [[Korea]], as the two countries stated themselves as a single-nation country, ethnic minorities had to hide their national identity for centuries, and many resulted in assimilation, such as [[Ainu people|Ainu]] and [[Ryukyuan people]] in Japan, migrants of [[Goguryeo]], [[Balhae]] and [[Tungusic peoples]] in Korea. Much conflict would arise when one nation asserted territorial rights to land outside its borders on the basis of a common bond with the people living on that land. (Example: organized territorial rights by [[Russia]] for [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]'s breakaway province of South [[Ossetia]] to North Ossetia)  Another source of conflict arose when a group of people who constituted a minority in one nation would seek to secede from the nation either to form an independent nation or join another nation with whom they felt stronger ties. Yet another source of conflict was the desire of some nations to expel people from territory within its borders on the ground that those people did not share a common bond with the majority of people living in that nation.{{specify|date=July 2014}}{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

It is useful to contrast the mass migrations and forced expulsion of ethnic [[Ethnic Germans|Germans]] out of [[Eastern Europe]] with other massive transfers of populations, such as [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], and population exchanges that occurred after the [[Partition of India]]. In all cases those expelled suffered greatly.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

At least one million members of [[Islam in China|China's Muslim]] [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] minority have been detained in [[Xinjiang re-education camps|mass detention camps]] in [[Xinjiang]], termed "[[Re-education through labor|reeducation camps]]", aimed at changing the political thinking of detainees, their identities, and their religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/09/19/china-has-chosen-cultural-genocide-in-xinjiang-for-now/|title=China Has Chosen Cultural Genocide in Xinjiang—For Now|last=Cronin-Furman|first=Kate|website=Foreign Policy|language=en|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, [[Reuters]] reported that "[[Ukraine]]’s neighbors have a right to criticize a [[Education in Ukraine#2017 law "On Education"|new Ukrainian law]] banning schools from teaching in minority languages beyond primary school level, a leading European rights watchdog said".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Criticism of Ukraine's language law justified: rights body |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-language/criticism-of-ukraines-language-law-justified-rights-body-idUSKBN1E227K |publisher=Reuters |date=December 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Beginning in 2019, instruction in [[Russian language]] will be gradually discontinued in private colleges and [[private university|universities]] in [[Latvia]], as well as general instruction in Latvian public [[high school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/education/?doc=141256|title=Latvian president promulgates bill banning teaching in Russian at private universities|date=April 7, 2018|publisher=The Baltic Course|accessdate=August 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eng.lsm.lv/article/society/education/government-okays-transition-to-latvian-as-sole-language-at-schools-in-2019.a265290/|title=Government okays transition to Latvian as sole language at schools in 2019|date=January 23, 2018|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting of Latvia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permanent Representative of the [[Russian Federation]] to the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] Alexander Lukashevich has denounced the reform as a "discriminatory policy with the goal of forced assimilation of the Russian-speaking population."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/languages-culture/news/in-latvia-school-language-reform-irks-russian-minority/|title=Latvia's school language reform irks Russian minority|date=June 25, 2018|publisher=[[EURACTIV]]|accessdate=August 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forced religious assimilation==
{{see also|Forced conversion|Jewish assimilation}}
Assimilation also includes the (often [[forced conversion|forced]]) [[religious conversion|conversion]] or [[secularization]] of religious members of a minority group.

Throughout the Middle Ages and until the mid-19th century, most Jews in Europe were forced to live in small towns ([[shtetl]]s) and were restricted from entering universities or high-level professions. See also [[Christianity in Pakistan]] for contemporary issues.

==Immigration==
When new [[immigrant]]s enter a country, there is a tension as they adapt to new people and surroundings to fit in, while holding on to their original culture. Here, studies show that native inhabitants often expect assimilation especially from negatively viewed immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Montreuil | first1 = Annie | last2 = Richard | first2 = Y.
