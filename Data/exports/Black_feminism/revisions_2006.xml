Forms of feminism that strive to overcome sexism and class oppression but ignore or minimize race can perpetuate racism and thereby contribute to the oppression of many people, including women. Black feminists argue that the liberation of Black women entails freedom for all people, since it would require the end of racism, sexism, and class oppression.

The current incarnation of '''Black Feminism''' is a political/social movement that grew out of a sense of feelings of discontent with both the [[Civil Rights|Civil Rights Movement]] and the [[Feminism|Feminist Movement]] of the 1970s.  Not only did the Civil Rights Movement primarily focus only on the oppression of black men, but many black women faced severe sexism within Civil Rights groups such as the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]].  The Feminist Movement focused on the problems faced by white women.  For instance, earning the power to work outside of the home was not an accomplishment for black feminists; they had been working all along.  Neither movement confronted the issues that concerned black women specifically.  Because of their [[intersectionality|intersectional position]], black women were being systematically disappeared by both movements.  Black women began creating theory and developing a new movement which spoke to the combination of problems, sexism, racism, classism, etc., that they had been battling.

One of the theories that evolved out of this movement was [[Alice Walker|Alice Walker's]] [[Womanism]].  [[Angela Davis]] was one of the first people who formed an argument centered on intersectionality; she did this in her book, "Women, Race, and Class."  [[Kimberle Crenshaw]], prominent feminist law theorist, gave the idea a name while discussing [[Identity Politics]] in her essay, "Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics and Violence Against Women of Color."  Another Feminist theorist is [[Patricia Hill Collins]]; much of her work concerns the politics of black feminist thought and oppression.  While many of these theorists were beginning their writing, Black Feminist groups were forming.  One of these groups is [[The Combahee River Collective]], founded by [[Barbara Smith]]; this group's primary goal was "the development of integrated analysis and practice based upon the fact that the major systems of oppression are interlocking."
