'''Sex education''', also known as '''sexual education''', '''sexuality''' '''education''' or '''sex ed''', is the instruction of issues relating to [[human sexuality]], including [[human sexual anatomy]], [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], [[sexual reproduction]], [[safe sex]], and [[birth control]], [[sexual health]], [[reproductive health]], emotional relations and responsibilities, [[age of consent]], and [[reproductive rights]]. Sex education that includes all of these issues is known as [[comprehensive sexuality education]]. In contrast, [[abstinence-only sex education]], which focuses solely on promoting [[sexual abstinence]], is often favored in more [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] regions, including some parts of the United States. Sex education may be provided as part of school programs, public health campaigns, or by parents or caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=European Expert Group On Sexuality Education |title=Sexuality education – what is it? |journal=[[Sex Education (journal)|Sex Education]] |date=2016 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=427–431 |doi=10.1080/14681811.2015.1100599 |doi-access=free|hdl=1854/LU-7006828 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldfarb |first1=Eva S. |last2=Lieberman |first2=Lisa D. |title=Sex Ed in the Post-Roe World: Implications for Public Health Education (Sexual &amp; Reproductive Health after Roe v Wade) |journal=[[Health Education &amp; Behavior]] |date=2022 |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=919–923 |doi=10.1177/10901981221125429 |pmid=36172998 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/10901981221125429 }}{{void|Fabrickator|comment|the doi value embeeded in the url appears to access a different document than the document that the url accesses.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maasoumi |first1=Raziyeh |last2=Azin |first2=Seyed Ali |last3=Nedjat |first3=Saharnaz |last4=Parto |first4=Moslem |last5=Zamani Hajiabadi |first5=Arshia |last6=Samadaee Gelehkolaee |first6=Keshvar |title=The effect of sexuality education based on the information, motivation, and behavioral skills model on improving the teachers' professional competence |journal=[[Heliyon]] |date=2024 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=e24170 |doi=10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e24170 |doi-access=free|pmid=38293482 |pmc=10825351 |bibcode=2024Heliy..1024170M }}&lt;/ref&gt; In {{Clarify|reason=which?|date=January 2023|text=some countries}} it is known as "Relationships and Sexual Health Education".

Many governments see it as beneficial to provide [[public education]] on such matters prior to or at the beginning of [[puberty]] for reasons of [[public health]], in limiting the spread of [[sexually transmitted infection]]s, and avoiding [[teenage pregnancy]] or [[unwanted pregnancies]] later on.

==History==
{{Globalize|1=section|2=USA|date=July 2022}}
In many cultures, the discussion of all sexual issues has traditionally been considered [[taboo]], and adolescents were not given any information on sexual matters. Such instruction, as was given, was traditionally left to a child's parents, and often this was put off until just before their marriage. However, in the late 19th century, the [[progressive education]] movement led to the introduction of sex education as "[[social hygiene]]" in North American school curricula and the introduction of school-based sex education.&lt;ref name=Tupper&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tupper| first=Kenneth| title=Sex, Drugs and the Honour Roll: The Perennial Challenges of Addressing Moral Purity Issues in Schools|journal=Critical Public Health |year=2013 |volume=24| issue=2| pages=115–131|doi=10.1080/09581596.2013.862517|s2cid=143931197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second World War]], UK governmental concerns grew around mass relocation, parentless youths, and young men and women working together for the first time.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Board of Education (1943) Sex Education in Schools and Youth Organisations. London: HMSO.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only were there fears of new sexually transmitted diseases, but there was also growing anxiety around young pregnancy putting pressure on the war-ravaged economy and healthcare system. As such, the UK Board for Education introduced the ''Sex Education in Schools and Youth Organisations'' guidance. This put the onus of sex education on schools and youth groups, and guided leaders on how to execute this. For example, the mechanics of sexual intercourse could be communicated via "the keeping of livestock", as students could observe reproduction in real-time; the guidance also encouraged discussions about [[menstruation]], motherhood courses, and personal [[hygiene]] talks. Popular among teachers and many parents, this guidance – which made sex education a possibility, not an obligation – prevailed for many years in the UK.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the 1970s, informational films became popular among teachers. Martin Cole's ''[[Growing Up (1971 film)|Growing Up]]'' (1971) was a frank look at how sex works physiologically and socially. It showed real clips of penises and masturbation, which sparked some backlash.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=A Brief History of British Sex Education |url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/nnqxaw/a-brief-history-of-british-sex-education-069 |access-date=2022-10-18 |website=www.vice.com |date=February 25, 2015 |language=en |archive-date=October 18, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221018135726/https://www.vice.com/en/article/nnqxaw/a-brief-history-of-british-sex-education-069 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it became apparent in the 1980s that a frank and factual approach was required in sex education as the [[HIV/AIDS in the United Kingdom|HIV/AIDS]] crisis began in the UK. In 1999, the Labour government introduced Sex and Relationships Education guidance, with particular focus on sexually transmitted diseases and teenage pregnancy. This was part of the ten-year Teenage Pregnancy Strategy, which would eventually resolve in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Hadley A, Ingham R, Chandra-Mouli V| title=Implementing the United Kingdom's ten-year teenage pregnancy strategy for England (1999–2010): How was this done and what did it achieve? | journal=Reprod Health | year= 2016 | volume= 13 | issue= 1 | pages= 139 | pmid=27876052 | doi=10.1186/s12978-016-0255-4 | pmc=5120422 | doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teenage pregnancy rates were halved across this period, however similar changes in other countries indicate that this was not an effect of the strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Baxter |first1=Andrew J. |last2=Dundas |first2=Ruth |last3=Popham |first3=Frank |last4=Craig |first4=Peter |date=2021-02-01 |title=How effective was England's teenage pregnancy strategy?

After the second world war, some developing countries promoted sex education programs that evolved to address political goals. A growing anxiety in some areas of the world over rising birth rates led to population-centered sex education programs. For instance, the first sex education curriculum in Singapore between 1966 and 1973 emphasized birth control as a way to avoid overpopulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goh |first1=Benjamin |title=A Glocal History of Post-independence Singapore's First Sex Education Curriculum, 1966-1973 |journal=History of Education Quarterly |date=May 2024 |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=144–163 |doi=10.1017/heq.2023.53|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reforms in some socialist countries focused on the role of sex education to strengthen family ties within society. This was the focus of sex education programs that developed in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and Cuba during the late twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Töpper |first1=Daniel |title=Socialist Sex Education an Its Transnational Entanglements: Monika Krause and the Effort to "Teach Tenderness" to the People |journal=History of Education Quarterly |date=May 2024 |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=164–192 |doi=10.1017/heq.2024.1|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The evolving content of sex education programs reflected shifting opinions regarding sexuality within each society. For example, in Swedish sex education guidelines and textbooks published between 1945 to 2000,  the practice of masturbation, once depicted as inherently harmful, became portrayed as natural and harmless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Backman Prytz |first1=Sara |title=The Textbook Masturbator: A Renovated Discourse in Official Swedish Sex-Education Guidelines and Textbooks, circa 1945-2000 |journal=History of Education Quarterly |date=May 2024 |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.1017/heq.2023.24|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Globally, the outbreak of AIDS has given a new sense of urgency to sex education. In many African countries, where AIDS is at epidemic levels (see [[HIV/AIDS in Africa]]), sex education is seen by most scientists as a vital [[public health]] strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Namibia National Policy on HIV/AIDS for the Education Sector |url=http://www.youth-policy.com//Policies/NBANatl_Pol_HIV_AIDS_Education_Sector.pdf |publisher=USAID Health Policy Initiative|access-date=November 8, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108060907/http://www.youth-policy.com//Policies/NBANatl_Pol_HIV_AIDS_Education_Sector.pdf|archive-date=November 8, 2013|year=2003|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some international organizations such as [[Planned Parenthood]] consider that broad sex education programs have global benefits, such as controlling the risk of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and the advancement of [[women's rights]] (see also reproductive rights). The use of mass media campaigns has sometimes resulted in high levels of "awareness" coupled with essentially superficial knowledge of HIV transmission.&lt;ref name="newapproach"&gt;{{cite news|title=A New Approach to Global HIV/AIDS Education|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-piya-sorcar/a-new-approach-to-global-_b_790420.html|author=Piya Sorcar|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=December 1, 2010|access-date=December 16, 2010|author-link=Piya Sorcar|archive-date=March 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085106/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-piya-sorcar/a-new-approach-to-global-_b_790420.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[SIECUS]], the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, 93% of adults they surveyed support sexuality education in high school and 84% support it in junior high school.&lt;ref&gt;SIECUS Report of Public Support of Sexuality Education (2009){{cite web|url=http://www.siecus.org/school/sex_ed/sex_ed0002.html |title=SIECUS Report Online |access-date=2007-12-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509064706/http://www.siecus.org/school/sex_ed/sex_ed0002.html |archive-date=May 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, 88% of the parents of junior high school students and 80% of parents of secondary school students believe that sex education in school makes it easier for them to talk to their adolescents about sex.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2004/02/24/1622610/sex-education-in-americaSex Education in America] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230225214036/https://www.npr.org/2004/02/24/1622610/sex-education-in-americaSex |date=February 25, 2023 }}. (Washington, DC: National Public Radio, [[Kaiser Family Foundation]], and [[Harvard Kennedy School]], 2004), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, 92% of adolescents report that they want both to talk to their parents about sex and to have comprehensive in-school sex education.&lt;ref&gt;Sari Locker, (2001) Sari Says: The real dirt on everything from sex to school. HarperCollins: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a "study, conducted by [[Mathematica Policy Research]] on behalf of the US Department of Health and Human Services, found that abstinence-only-until-marriage programs are ineffective."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100616150557/http://www.siecus.org/_data/global/images/research_says.pdf SIECUS Fact Sheet] (includes research citations).&lt;/ref&gt;

The current frontier in the development of Relationship and Sex Education (RSE) is [[LGBT]]Q+ inclusion. The recent 2019 guidance update is tentative in its acknowledgement of LGBT people, something which has proved controversial among homo- and transphobic groups, as well as among LGBT allies and pro-inclusion sociologists.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Glazzard |first1=Jonathan |last2=Stones |first2=Samuel |date=2021 |title=Running Scared?

Leepson sees sex education as instruction in various [[Physiology|physiological]], psychological and [[Sociology|sociological]] aspects of sexual response and reproduction.&lt;ref name="DeLaMare"&gt;Referred in [http://www.educationalleaders.govt.nz/Leadership-development/Professional-information/Principals-sabbatical-reports/Report-archives-for-2007-2011/Primary-award-recipients-2011/De-La-Mare-Jeanette paper by Jeanette De La Mare.

Thus, sex education may also be described as "sexuality education", which means that it encompasses education about all aspects of sexuality, including information about [[family planning]], [[reproduction]] ([[Human fertilization|fertilization]], [[Conception (biology)|conception]] and development of the [[embryo]] and [[fetus]], through to childbirth), plus information about all aspects of one's sexuality including: [[body image]], [[sexual orientation]], [[sexual pleasure]], [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], decision making, communication, [[dating]], [[Intimate relationship|relationships]], [[sexually transmitted infection]]s (STIs) and how to avoid them, and [[birth control]] methods.&lt;ref name="DeLaMare" /&gt; Various aspects of sex education are considered appropriate in school depending on the age of the students or what the children can comprehend at a particular point in time. Rubin and Kindendall expressed that sex education is not merely the topics of reproduction and teaching how babies are conceived and born. Instead, it has a far richer scope and goal of helping children incorporate sex more meaningfully into their present and future life and to provide them with some basic understanding of virtually every aspect of sex by the time they reach full maturity.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin and Kindendall (2001){{full citation needed|date=April 2021}}{{page needed|date=April 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
Evidence shows that a combination of comprehensive sexuality education and access to birth control appears to decrease the rates of unintended pregnancies among teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oringanje |first1=Chioma |last2=Meremikwu |first2=Martin M |last3=Eko |first3=Hokehe |last4=Esu |first4=Ekpereonne |last5=Meremikwu |first5=Anne |last6=Ehiri |first6=John E |title=Interventions for preventing unintended pregnancies among adolescents |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=3 February 2016 |volume=2016 |issue=2 |pages=CD005215 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005215.pub3 |pmid=26839116 |pmc=8730506 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis that compared comprehensive sexuality education programs with abstinence-only programs found that abstinence-only programs did not reduce the likelihood of pregnancy, but rather may have increased it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DiCenso |first1=A. |last2=Guyatt |first2=G |last3=Willan |first3=A |last4=Griffith |first4=L |title=Interventions to reduce unintended pregnancies among adolescents: systematic review of randomised controlled trials |journal=BMJ |date=15 June 2002 |volume=324 |issue=7351 |pages=1426 |doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7351.1426 |pmid=12065267 |pmc=115855 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous studies show that curricula providing accurate information about condoms and contraception can lead to reductions in the [[risky sexual behavior|risky behaviors]] reported by young people as well as reductions in unintended pregnancies and STIs.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/comprehensive-sexuality-education|title=Comprehensive sexuality education – UNFPA – United Nations Population Fund|access-date=March 13, 2017|archive-date=March 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210320005339/https://www.unfpa.org/comprehensive-sexuality-education|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs that teach only abstinence have not been shown to be effective.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt;

According to UNFPA, "A 2010 review found that 'gender-focused' curricula – meaning curricula that integrate gender equality into the learning material – were substantially more effective in reducing risky behaviors than programmes that did not consider gender."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt; Research has also shown that delay in sexual initiation, use of condoms and practice contraception has been a result of young people adopting egalitarian attitudes about gender roles. These individuals were also found to be less likely engaged in violent relationships and have a lower rate of STIs including HIV and unintended pregnancy.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt;

By emphasizing rights and gender issues, these programs help reduce gender-based violence and bullying, promote safe schools, empower young people to advocate for their own rights, and advance gender equality.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt;

"Few sexual health interventions are designed with input from adolescents. Adolescents have suggested that sex education should be more positive with less emphasis on [[anatomy]] and scare tactics; it should focus on negotiation skills in sexual relationships and communication; and details of sexual health clinics should be advertised in areas that adolescents frequent (for example, school toilets, shopping centres)."&lt;ref name=" DiCenso"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DiCenso |first1=Alba |last2=Guyatt |first2=Gordon |last3=Willan |first3=A. |last4=Griffith |first4=L. |title=Interventions to reduce unintended pregnancies among adolescents: systematic review of randomised controlled trials |journal=BMJ |date=15 June 2002 |volume=324 |issue=7351 |pages=1426 |doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7351.1426 |pmid=12065267 |pmc=115855 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, a U.S. review concludes that "the overwhelming weight of evidence shows that sex education that discusses contraception does not increase sexual activity".&lt;ref name="Kirby"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kirby |first1=Douglas |title=Emerging Answers: Research Findings on Programs to Reduce Teen Pregnancy |date=2001 |publisher=National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy |id={{ERIC|ED456171}} |isbn=978-1-58671-037-8 }}{{page needed|date=April 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirby2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kirby |first1=Douglas |title=Emerging Answers: Research Findings on Programs to Reduce Teen Pregnancy |date=2007 |publisher=National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy |isbn=978-1-58671-070-5 }}{{page needed|date=April 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 study found that "No comprehensive program hastened the initiation of sex or increased the frequency of sex, results that many people fear." Further, the report showed "Comprehensive programs worked for both genders, for all major ethnic groups, for sexually inexperienced and experienced teens, in different settings, and in different communities."&lt;ref name="Kirby2007" /&gt;

[[The United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) recommends comprehensive sexuality education, as it enables young people to make informed decisions about their sexuality. According to UNFPA,&lt;ref name="Guide"&gt;{{cite web|title=UNFPA Operational Guidance for Comprehensive Sexuality Education: A Focus on Human Rights and Gender|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/UNFPA_OperationalGuidance_WEB3.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/UNFPA_OperationalGuidance_WEB3.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live|publisher=[[United Nations Population Fund|UNFPA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It is taught over several years, introducing age-appropriate information consistent with the evolving capacities of young people. It includes scientifically accurate, curriculum-based information about human development, anatomy and pregnancy. It also includes information about contraception and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. And it goes beyond information, to encourage confidence and improved communication skills. Curricula should also address the social issues surrounding sexuality and reproduction, including cultural norms, family life and interpersonal relationships.&lt;/blockquote&gt;When places have more comprehensive sexuality education, STI and pregnancy rates drop.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|date=2017-09-18|title=America's Sex Education: How We Are Failing Our Students – Nursing@USC|url=https://nursing.usc.edu/blog/americas-sex-education/|access-date=2021-09-26|website=USC-MSN|language=en-US|archive-date=October 5, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211005192232/https://nursing.usc.edu/blog/americas-sex-education/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attitudes of children have also been found to differ depending on the content of their sex education. One comparison of results can be made between the sex education curriculum in the Netherlands and that in the US. On average teens in Europe and the Netherlands (which have more comprehensive sex ed) do not have sex at a younger age than teens in the US (with less comprehensive sex ed); however teens in the Netherlands report having a positive and consensual first sexual experience while 66% of sexually active US teens report that they wished they waited longer for their first sexual experience.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite web|date=2015-05-27|title=The case for starting sex education in kindergarten|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/spring-fever|access-date=2021-09-26|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-us|archive-date=September 27, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210927002144/https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/spring-fever|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights issues, gender equality and gender roles should be integrated into every aspect of these discussions. This includes human rights protection, fulfillment and empowerment; the impact of gender discrimination; the importance of equality and gender-sensitivity; and the ideas underlying gender roles. Sexual abuse, gender-based violence and harmful practices should also be discussed. Taken together, all this information teaches young people the life skills necessary to assume responsibility for their own behavior and to respect the rights of others."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt;

Comprehensive sexuality education "enables young people to make informed decisions about their sexuality and health. These programmes build life skills and increase responsible behaviors, and because they are based on human rights principles, they help advance human rights, gender equality and the empowerment of young people."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt;

Those same adolescents may also have a hard time talking to their families about sexual matters.

Slyer stated that sex education teaches the young person what he or she should know for his or her personal conduct and relationship with others.&lt;ref&gt;Slyer (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Gruenberg also stated that sex education is necessary to prepare the young for the task ahead. According to him, officials generally agree that some kind of planned sex education is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Gruenberg (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes formal sex education is taught as a full course as part of the curriculum in [[junior high school]] or high school. Other times it is only one unit within a more broad [[biology]], health, [[home economics]], or [[physical education]] class. Some schools offer no sex education, since it remains a controversial issue in several countries, particularly the United States (especially with regard to the age at which children should start receiving such education, the amount of detail that is revealed, including [[LGBT sex education]],&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; and topics dealing with [[human sexual behavior]], e.g. [[safe sex]] practices, [[masturbation]], [[premarital sex]], and [[sexual ethics]]).

Wilhelm Reich commented that sex education of his time was a work of deception, focusing on biology while concealing [[sexual arousal|excitement-arousal]], which is what a [[Puberty|pubescent]] individual is mostly interested in. Reich added that this emphasis obscures what he believed to be a basic psychological principle: that all worries and difficulties originate from unsatisfied sexual impulses.&lt;ref&gt;Reich (2006) ''[[Die Sexualität im Kulturkampf]]''. Part one "the failure.." 6. The puberty problem – (3°) "A reflection.." – c. sexual relationships of pubescents – paragraph 4.a (pp. 198–99 of Italian edition)&lt;/ref&gt; Leepson asserted that the majority of people favor some sort of sex instruction in public schools, and this has become an intensely controversial issue because, unlike most subjects, sex education is concerned with an especially sensitive and highly personal part of human life. He suggested that sex education should be taught in the classroom.&lt;ref name=DeLaMare /&gt;
The problem of pregnancy in adolescents is delicate and difficult to assess using sex education.&lt;ref&gt;Deschamps, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; But Calderone{{Who|date=June 2011}} believed otherwise, stating that the answer to adolescents' sexual woes and pregnancy can not lie primarily in school programmes which at best can only be remedial; what is needed is prevention education and as such parents should be involved.

When sex education is contentiously debated, the chief controversial points are whether covering [[child sexuality]] is valuable or detrimental; whether LGBT sex education should be integrated into the curriculum;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; the use of [[birth control]] such as [[condom]]s and [[hormonal contraception]]; and the impact of such use on pregnancy outside marriage, [[teenage pregnancy]], and the transmission of STIs. Increasing support for [[abstinence-only sex education]] by conservative groups has been one of the primary causes of this controversy. Countries with conservative attitudes towards sex education (including the UK and the U.S.) have a higher incidence of STIs and teenage pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Joy of sex education"&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/comment/story/0,,1214047,00.html "Joy of sex education" by George Monbiot] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706044759/http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/comment/story/0,,1214047,00.html |date=July 6, 2008 }}, ''The Guardian'', May 11, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it seems that in countries where sex education is not part of the curriculum, students show limited knowledge even in basic reproductive issues. For example, in a 2019 study with Greek students, it is reported that about two-thirds of the students failed to name external female genitals, such as the clitoris and labia, even after detailed pictures were provided to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ampatzidis |first1=Georgios |last2=Georgakopoulou |first2=Despoina |last3=Kapsi |first3=Georgia |date=2021-05-27 |title=Clitoris, the unknown: what do postgraduate students of educational sciences know about reproductive physiology and anatomy? |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00219266.2019.1679658 |journal=Journal of Biological Education |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=254–263 |doi=10.1080/00219266.2019.1679658 |s2cid=208590370 |issn=0021-9266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==
A survey conducted in Britain, Canada and the United States by [[Angus Reid Public Opinion]] in November 2011 asked adult respondents to look back to the time when they were teenagers, and describe how useful several sources were in enabling them to learn more about sex. By far, the largest proportion of respondents in the three countries (74% in Canada, 67% in Britain and 63% in the United States) said that conversations with friends were "very useful" or "moderately useful." The next reputable source was the media (television, books, movies, magazines), mentioned by three-in-five British (65%) and Canadians (62%) and more than half of Americans (54%) as useful.

In 2011, ''[[Angus Reid Public Opinion]]'' said that half of Canadians (54%) and Americans (52%) found their sex education courses at school to be useful, only 43% of Britons share the same view. And while more than half of Americans (57%) say conversations with family were useful, only 49% of Canadians and 35% of Britons said so.&lt;ref name=opinion&gt;{{cite news|title=Americans, Britons and Canadians Disagree on Sex Education|url=http://angusreidglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011.11.30_SexEd.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018215345/http://angusreidglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011.11.30_SexEd.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 18, 2016|author=Mario Canseco|work=[[Angus Reid Public Opinion]]|date=November 30, 2011|access-date=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Africa ===
Sex education in Africa has focused on stemming the growing [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|AIDS epidemic]]. Most governments in the region have established AIDS education programs in partnership with the [[World Health Organization]] and international NGOs. These programs were undercut significantly by the [[Mexico City policy]], an initiative put in place by President [[Ronald Reagan]], suspended by President [[Bill Clinton]], and re-instated by President [[George W. Bush]]. The Global Gag Rule "required nongovernmental organizations to agree as a condition of their receipt of Federal funds that such organizations would neither perform nor actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/20010123-5.html |title=Restoration of the Mexico City Policy |access-date=August 5, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110203940/http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/20010123-5.html |archive-date=January 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The policy was again suspended as one of the first official acts by United States President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/23/AR2009012302814.html |title=Funding Restored to Groups That Perform Abortions, Other Care |work=Washingtonpost.com |access-date=August 5, 2014 |archive-date=November 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111031558/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/23/AR2009012302814.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; New HIV infections in Uganda decreased dramatically when Clinton supported a comprehensive sexuality education approach (including information about contraception and abortion).&lt;ref name="uganda"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/inf-new/aids2.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010005614/http://www.who.int/inf-new/aids2.htm|url-status=dead|title=Uganda reverses the tide of HIV/AIDS|archivedate=October 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ugandan AIDS activists, the policy undermined community efforts to reduce HIV prevalence and HIV transmission.&lt;ref name="PEPFAR"&gt;[http://www.stdcheck.com/aids-relief.php Health Gap: Pepfar Policies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20140226191956/http://www.stdcheck.com/aids-relief.php |date=February 26, 2014 }} Retrieved February 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===
The state of sex education programs in Asia is at various stages of development. The topic of sex education is considered to be very controversial because it deals with different topics which are sometimes too vague and too broad to be used effectively in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Gary |last2=Kippax |first2=Susan |author-link2=Susan Kippax |last3=Aggleton |first3=Peter |last4=Tyrer |first4=Paul |title=HIV/AIDS School-based Education in Selected Asia-Pacific Countries |journal=Sex Education |date=April 2003 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=3–21 |doi=10.1080/1468181032000052126 |s2cid=145274846 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thailand====
In [[Thailand]] there has been progress on sex education, with the boundaries being pushed forward with each revision of the curriculum. The first national policy on sexuality education in schools was announced in 1938, but sex education was not taught in schools until 1978. It was then called "Life and Family Studies", and its content consisted of issues related to the reproductive system and personal hygiene. The education curriculum has been revised several times, involving efforts from both government and non-government sectors, and sex education has been accepted as a problem solving tool for adolescent sexual reproduction and health issues. This has been a result of educational reform following the National Education Act B.E. 2542, increasing awareness of problems related to adolescents' sexual practices, and the emergence of women's sexuality and queer movements. Another new approach in sexuality education curricula in Thailand has been the Teenpath Project developed by [[PATH (global health organization)|PATH]], Thailand. PATH has also succeeded in institutionalizing sexuality education curricula in schools since 2003.

====India====
{{Main|Sex education in India}} Sex education in India remains a controversial subject due to conflicting religious, moral, and cultural beliefs regarding its place in adolescent and youth education. Sexual reproduction and different contraceptive methods are taught in grades 8 and 10 (age 14 and 16) compulsorily as a part of the biology course. In 1993, the Adolescent Education Programme (AEP) was initiated by the Government of India which formalised the need for sex education, similarly included in the [[National Curriculum Framework 2005|National Curriculum Framework]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2007-06-18 |title=Indian schools still not ready for sex education |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/education/story/20070618-no-sex-education-in-indian-schools-748388-2007-06-17 |access-date=2024-10-11 |website=India Today |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was no consensus among states to make it compulsory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Admin |date=2022-01-02 |title=WHAT IS THE CONTROVERSY AROUND NOT INCLUDING SEX EDUCATION AS A PART OF THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION IN INDIA? - Jus Corpus |url=https://www.juscorpus.com/what-is-the-controversy-around-not-including-sex-education-as-a-part-of-the-right-to-education-in-india/#_ftn4 |access-date=2024-10-11 |website=www.juscorpus.com |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dedicated comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) has not been mandated in any national school curricula. Some states in India have also banned or refused to implement sex education in their states, citing conflict with traditional Indian values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Javalgekar |first=Aishwarya |date=2017-08-28 |title=Is Sexuality Education Against Indian Culture? {{!}} #WhyCSE |url=https://feminisminindia.com/2017/08/29/sexuality-education-indian-culture/ |access-date=2024-10-11 |website=Feminism in India |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, there are many in- and out-of-school programmes promoting sex education, including information on reproduction, sexuality, gender, contraception, STIs, violence, etc. Once such example is the Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK), which was launched in 2014 by the [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare]] regarding adolescent health programming in the country, including sexual and reproductive health. Non-profit organisations and other groups in the development sector primarily lead the delivery of out-of-school CSE programmes. These organisations and collectives also work closely with relevant governmental ministries and multi-lateral institutions (like UNESCO and WHO) to engage in public advocacy and policy change around acceptance and implementation of sex education. 

The [[HIV/AIDS in India|AIDS prevalence]] rate in India is lower than that of many other countries, despite being home to the world's third-largest population of persons with HIV/AIDS (as of 2023, with South Africa and Nigeria having more).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=HIV/AIDS in India |url=https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2012/07/10/hiv-aids-india |access-date=2024-10-11 |website=World Bank |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, AIDS clinics are not universally available and accessible in across different geographic regions in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=July 21, 2015 |title=HIV and AIDS in India |url=http://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/asia-pacific/india |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520081712/http://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/asia-pacific/india |archive-date=May 20, 2016 |access-date=20 May 2016 |website=www.avert.org |quote=Indeed, many people living with HIV have difficulty accessing the clinics}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{blockquote|India has a strong prevention program which goes hand in hand with care, support and treatment.

==== China ====
In 2000, a new five-year project was introduced by the China Family Planning Association to "promote reproductive health education among Chinese teenagers and unmarried youth" in twelve urban districts and three counties. This included discussion about sex within human relationships as well as pregnancy and HIV prevention.&lt;ref name="chinasexed2"&gt;[http://www.chinadevelopmentbrief.com/node/57 Sex education begins to break taboos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928064000/http://www.chinadevelopmentbrief.com/node/57|date=September 28, 2007}} China Development Brief, June 3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 2010s there has been a great increase in books about sex education for children and young adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.princeton.edu/cotsen/2018/08/sex-education-china/|title=Let's Talk to Kids About Sex…in Chinese Too|last=Chen|first=Minjie|date=2018-08-24|website=Cotsen Children's Library|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-22|archive-date=June 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200603165559/https://blogs.princeton.edu/cotsen/2018/08/sex-education-china/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of sex education programs in China barely meets the international standards. China's sex education is absent, although there have been proposals made to include comprehensive sexuality education in the curriculum. Although such proposals have been made, there has not been any solid actions to implement such programs in school, mainly due to the conservative and traditional mindsets.{{Citation needed|date=May 2022}} The topic of sex is not talked about enough in public, and even shunned in private.

Most recently, China has introduced a new sexual education for students named the 'Healthy China Initiatives (2019–2030)'. The initiative came after a 2015 study by the China Family Planning Association conducted a study that showed only 10% of approximately 20,000 universities reported that they were not content with their sexual education in grade school and were unknowledgeable to violence, gender, contraceptives, sexually transmitted diseases, and pregnancy among other topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2019-09-26 |title=It is time to face the facts: Young people in China ask more from comprehensive sexuality education |url=https://en.unesco.org/news/it-time-face-facts-young-people-china-ask-more-comprehensive-sexuality-education |access-date=2022-03-29 |website=UNESCO |language=en |archive-date=March 29, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220329022104/https://en.unesco.org/news/it-time-face-facts-young-people-china-ask-more-comprehensive-sexuality-education |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative is said to help provide students with knowledge of gender, sexuality, equality, consent, and rights.

==== South Korea ====
In South Korea, sex education began in some schools in the 1960s, and has been officially taught in public schools since 1984.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;김수진, 김은빈, 김현진, 원하린, &amp; 이혜원 (2020). 학교 성교육 다시 쓰기 ：학교 성교육 실태 및 인식조사 분석을 통한 성교육 제언.

History and Development Strategy of School Health Education in Korea. 한국학교보건학회지, 25(2), 147-158.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, all primary and secondary schools are required to include at least 15 hours of sex education in every school year, though 12 hours can be replaced with other subjects using each school's discretion.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web |date=2024-09-25 |title=성교육도 '과외'…표준안도 못 만든 공교육 |url=https://news.sbs.co.kr/news/endPage.do?news_id=N1007812980&amp;plink=TIT&amp;cooper=SBSNEWS |access-date=2024-10-01 |website=SBS NEWS |language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2020 study, 81% of primary school students reported receiving sex education. Sex education was reportedly superficial and focused mostly on biological topics, such as bodily changes during puberty, the process of reproduction, the anatomy of the reproductuve system, and [[menstruation]]. Contraception and prevention of sexual violence were also covered. Most of the participants in the study were unsatisfied with the current state of sex education, and believed it was ineffective.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Sex education in schools has been subject to controversy, and has drawn crticisms from both conservative and feminist groups. A standardized guidline on sex education published by the [[Ministry of Education (South Korea)|Ministry of Education]] in 2015 was later withdrawn after being criticized for "poor quality".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Some Christian associations and parent groups have protested against in-depth sex education, specifically regarding [[reproductive rights]] and homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2022-10-08 |title=섹슈얼리티? 학생들에게 성생활 부추기겠다는 보건교과서 공청회 논란 |url=https://www.kwomanews.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=90 |access-date=2024-10-01 |website=한국여성뉴스 |language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, a demonstration on the correct use of a condom at a school was suspended due to complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2020-07-06 |editor=Yonhap News |title=A school teacher who was trying to demonstrate "putting in a condom" canceled it in response to a protest from parents. |url=https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20200706081400054 |lang=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South Korean governement has censored books regarding sex education due to pressure from conservative and parent groups.

Some South Korean parents, who want to properly educate their children about sex, rely on private education for sex education because of unsatisfactory sex education in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|lang=ko|title=Mothers said "Sex education in school is poor.

In most Islamic countries, sex education is given after marriage to the couple.

In [[Nepal]], sex education is mandatory in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/sex-education-2/|title=Sex education|date=2017-06-05|website=The Himalayan Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-22|archive-date=August 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190820080652/https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/sex-education-2/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, sex education is mandatory from age 10 or 11, mainly covering biological topics such as [[menstruation]] and [[ejaculation]].&lt;ref name="swedsexed"/&gt;

In [[Sri Lanka]], sex education traditionally consisted of reading the reproduction section of biology textbooks. Young people are taught when they are 12 years old.

The [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] and the [[BBC World Service]] ran a 12-part series known as ''Sexwise'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/sci_tech/features/health/sexwise/|title=Sexwise Home Page &amp;#124; Sexwise &amp;#124; BBC World Service|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=November 1, 2022|archive-date=November 1, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221101165539/https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/sci_tech/features/health/sexwise/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; which discussed sex education, family life education, contraception and parenting. It was first launched in South Asia and then extended worldwide.&lt;ref name="sexwise"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/courier/2000_07/uk/apprend3.htm Involve The Young!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505092431/http://www.unesco.org/courier/2000_07/uk/apprend3.htm |date=May 5, 2006 }} Interview with Dr Pramilla Senanayake, assistant director-general of the International Planned Parenthood Federation &lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Taiwan]], compared to China's progress, has been a lot more progressive in implementing sex education. However, the controversy lies more in anti-gay groups who argue that including same-sex relationships in sex education is morally controversial, despite being the first Asian country to legalize same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Chuang |first=Yu-Ning Aileen |date=2017-11-18 |title=If Parents In Taiwan Are OK With Their Kids' Sex Ed Class, Why Are Others So Upset? |language=en |work=NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/11/18/557368363/a-teachers-sex-ed-class-reveals-taiwan-s-struggles-for-pushing-gender-equity |access-date=2022-05-29 |archive-date=May 29, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220529201716/https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/11/18/557368363/a-teachers-sex-ed-class-reveals-taiwan-s-struggles-for-pushing-gender-equity |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, while sex education is required in school, LGBTQ topics have been rejected by many parents in the society, which potentially violates gender equity education in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Shen |first=Lien Fan |title=Gender and Sexuality in Taiwan Schools |date=2021-08-31 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.013.1582 |encyclopedia=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Education |publisher=Oxford University Press |doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.013.1582 |isbn=978-0-19-026409-3 |access-date=2022-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the ''Journal of Modern Education Review,'' Taiwan has committed to achieving gender equity since 2004 with its [[Gender Equity Education Act (Taiwan)]] (GEEA), which includes curriculum, material, and activities to be practiced and taught in elementary and middle school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=chen Kuo |first=Yeh |date=2015-09-15 |title=The Practice of Gender Equity Education in Taiwan |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.15341/jmer(2155-7993)/09.05.2015/005 |journal=Journal of Modern Education Review |volume=5 |issue=9 |pages=854–860 |doi=10.15341/jmer(2155-7993)/09.05.2015/005 |issn=2155-7993}}&lt;/ref&gt; But also as a relatively conservative Asian country and culture, Taiwan has not yet been up to par with international standards, but seemingly on its way towards more progressive sex education.

==== Singapore ====
The Singapore Family Planning Association has developed a series of sex education programs for young people, focusing on strict control of sexual behavior and age. The Singapore government attaches great importance to the moral education of young people, and the sentencing of sexual offenses is very strict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liew |first1=Warren Mark |title=Sex (education) in the city: Singapore's sexuality education curriculum |journal=Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education |date=3 September 2014 |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=705–717 |doi=10.1080/01596306.2014.931114 |s2cid=143451046 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
The [[World Health Organization]] and the German [[Bundeszentrale für gesundheitliche Aufklärung|Federal Office of Health Education]] recommend sex education for children of all ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bzga-whocc.de/pdf.php?id=061a863a0fdf28218e4fe9e1b3f463b3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509062320/http://www.bzga-whocc.de/pdf.php?id=061a863a0fdf28218e4fe9e1b3f463b3|url-status=dead|title=WHO Regional Office for Europe and BZgA Standards for Sexuality Education in Europe|archivedate=May 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Finland====
In [[Finland]], sexual education is usually incorporated into various compulsory courses, mainly as part of biology lessons (in lower grades) and later in a course related to general health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kontula |first1=Osmo |title=The evolution of sex education and students' sexual knowledge in Finland in the 2000s |journal=Sex Education |date=November 2010 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=373–386 |id={{ERIC|EJ901096}} |doi=10.1080/14681811.2010.515095 |s2cid=31740239 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
In France, sex education has been part of school curricula since 1973, though optional. Schools are expected to provide 30 to 40 hours of sex education, and pass out condoms, to students in grades 8 and 9 (aged 14). In January 2000, the French government launched an information campaign on contraception with TV and radio spots and the distribution of five million leaflets on contraception to high school students.&lt;ref name=" britsexed"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/courier/2000_07/uk/apprend.htm Britain: Sex Education Under Fire] ''UNESCO Courier'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222184211/http://www.unesco.org/courier/2000_07/uk/apprend.htm |date=December 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In September 2013, the government launched a new program called {{Lang|fr|les ABCD de l’égalité}} ('the ABCD of equality') whose main aim is to "fight gender stereotypes at school". The ultimate goal is to foster mutual respect between boys and girls early on so that it impacts their conception of the world later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Vincent Peillon |url=http://www.gouvernement.fr/gouvernement/les-abcd-de-l-egalite-un-outil-pour-lutter-des-l-ecole-contre-les-inegalites-filles-gar |title=Les ABCD de l'égalité : un outil pour lutter dès l'école contre les inégalités filles-garçons &amp;#124; Portail du Gouvernement |publisher=Gouvernement.fr |date=January 13, 2014 |access-date=August 5, 2014 |archive-date=June 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629151358/http://www.gouvernement.fr/gouvernement/les-abcd-de-l-egalite-un-outil-pour-lutter-des-l-ecole-contre-les-inegalites-filles-gar |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
The first state-sponsored courses on sex education were introduced in Breslau, Prussia, c. 1900 by Dr. Martin Chotzen.&lt;ref name="hammill"&gt;{{cite web

In Germany, sex education has been part of school curricula since 1970. Since 1992 sex education is a governmental duty by law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bildungsklick.de/pm/35091/sexualaufklaerung-in-europa/ Sexualaufklärung in Europa] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927064715/http://bildungsklick.de/pm/35091/sexualaufklaerung-in-europa/ |date=September 27, 2011 }} (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

It normally covers all subjects concerning the process of growing up, bodily changes during puberty, emotions involved, the biological process of reproduction, sexual activity, partnership, homosexuality, unwanted pregnancies and the complications of abortion, the dangers of [[sexual violence]], [[child abuse]], and sex-transmitted diseases. It is comprehensive enough that it sometimes also includes things in its curricula such as sex positions. Most schools offer courses on the correct usage of contraception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2003/03/Schmutzige_Gedanken Sexualkunde-Schmutzige Gedanken] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017112940/http://www.zeit.de/2003/03/Schmutzige_Gedanken |date=October 17, 2008 }} (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

A sex survey by the [[World Health Organization]] concerning the habits of European teenagers in 2006 revealed that German teenagers care about contraception. The birth rate among 15- to 19-year-olds was very low—only 11.7 per 1000 people, compared to 27.8 births per 1,000 people in the UK, and 39.0 births per 1,000 people in Bulgaria (which, incidentally, has the highest birth rate in Europe).&lt;ref name="EUROPEAN SEX SURVEY"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,454492,00.html |title=European Sex Survey |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=December 14, 2006 |access-date=August 5, 2014 |archive-date=March 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306213033/http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,454492,00.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

German Constitutional Court and later, in 2011, the [[European Court of Human Rights]], rejected complaints from several [[Baptists]] against Germany concerning mandatory sex education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/app/conversion/pdf/?library=ECHR&amp;id=003-3681421-4188471&amp;filename=003-3681421-4188471.pdf Complaints against Germany about mandatory sex education classes declared inadmissible] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107232924/https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/app/conversion/pdf/?library=ECHR&amp;id=003-3681421-4188471&amp;filename=003-3681421-4188471.pdf |date=January 7, 2018 }} ECtHR press release 153 (2011), September 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Greece ====
A 2022 analysis reported that human reproduction is mentioned in six out of 113 Greek secondary education textbooks used in biology classes from 1870s to present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Ampatzidis |first1=Georgios |title=Human Reproduction in Greek Secondary Education Textbooks (1870s to Present) |date=2022 |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-89480-1_20 |work=Current Research in Biology Education: Selected Papers from the ERIDOB Community |pages=257–268 |editor-last=Korfiatis |editor-first=Konstantinos |place=Cham |publisher=Springer International Publishing |language=en |doi=10.1007/978-3-030-89480-1_20 |isbn=978-3-030-89480-1 |access-date=2022-04-06 |last2=Armeni |first2=Anastasia |series=Contributions from Biology Education Research |editor2-last=Grace |editor2-first=Marcus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poland====
At the time of the [[People's Republic of Poland]], since 1973, sex education was one of the school subjects; however, it was relatively poor and did not achieve any actual success. After 1989, it practically vanished from the school life—it is currently a subject called "family life education" ({{Lang|pl|wychowanie do życia w rodzinie}}) rather than "sex education" ({{Lang|pl|edukacja seksualna}})—and schools explicitly require parental consent for their children to attend sex education classes. This policy is largely due to the strong objection against sex education raised by the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.racjonalista.pl/kk.php/s,6168 |title=Edukacja seksualna w polityce władz centralnych po transformacji ustrojowej |publisher=Racjonalista.pl |date=October 31, 2008 |access-date=August 5, 2014 |archive-date=August 8, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808060501/http://www.racjonalista.pl/kk.php/s,6168 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/article/gender-sexuality-english-language-education-focus-poland |title=Pakuła Ł, Pawelczyk J., Sunderland, J. 2015 Gender and Sexuality in English Language Education: Focus on Poland.

====Portugal====
Some sex education is taught as part of biology-related curricula. There is also an official program intended to provide sex education for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dgidc.min-edu.pt/educacaosaude/index.php?s=directorio&amp;pid=107 |title=DGE – Educação Sexual em Meio Escolar – Educação para a Saúde |publisher=Dgidc.min-edu.pt |access-date=August 5, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810152902/http://www.dgidc.min-edu.pt/educacaosaude/index.php?s=directorio&amp;pid=107 |archive-date=August 10, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
Subsidized by the Dutch government, the "Long Live Love" package ({{Lang|nl|Lang leve de liefde}}), developed in the late 1980s, aims to give teenagers the skills to make their own decisions regarding health and sexuality. Nearly all secondary schools provide sex education, as part of biology classes and over half of primary schools discuss sexuality and contraception. Starting the 2012 school year, age-appropriate sex education—including education about [[sexual diversity]] —has been compulsory in all secondary and primary schools. The curriculum focuses on biological aspects of reproduction as well as on values, attitudes, communication and negotiation skills. Dutch sex education encourages the idea that topics like masturbation, homosexuality, and sexual pleasure are normal or natural and that there are larger emotional, relational, and societal forces that shape the experiences of sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schalet|first1=Amy|title=Not under My Roof: Parents, Teens, and the Culture of Sex.|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of curriculum can begin for students as young as at age four. The curriculum for children focuses on topics like love, self-image, and gender stereotypes. All elementary level students in the Netherlands are required by law to receive some level of sex education. There is some flexibility in how the subject is taught however there are some required principles such as sexual diversity and sexual assertiveness.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; Moreover, according to Amy Schalet, Dutch parents tend to form close relationships with their children, openly discussing [[Adolescent sexuality|teen sexuality]]. Dutch parents try to accept their children's romantic relationships and even allow sleepovers, expecting them to have sex.&lt;ref&gt;[Schalet, Amy T. Not under My Roof: Parents, Teens, and the Culture of Sex. Chicago: U of Chicago, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; The media has encouraged open dialogue and the health-care system guarantees confidentiality and a non-judgmental approach. The Netherlands has one of the lowest teenage pregnancy rates in the world, and the Dutch approach is often seen as a model for other countries.&lt;ref name="dutchmodel"&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001201/120152e.pdf The Dutch model] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181437/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001201/120152e.pdf |date=March 3, 2016 }} ''UNESCO Courier''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Slovakia====
In [[Slovakia]] the content of sex education varies from school to school, most frequently as a segment of a larger lesson plan of a subject akin to nature science in English (this course covers both biology and [[petrology]]). Generally the sex ed content taught in Slovakia is quite basic, sometimes lacking, though exactly what any given lesson contains varies among schools and is dependent on the teacher's knowledge of the subject. It is not uncommon for teachers to rely on students asking questions (as opposed to documentaries, discussions, textbooks and in-class debates). Classes are usually divided into boys and girls. Boys are taught the basics of sex, usually limited to dialogue between student and teacher of annotated diagrams of genitalia; while girls are additionally taught about menstruation and pregnancy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

====Sweden====
In Sweden, sex education was established in 1921 for secondary education and in 1942 for all grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sex Education: Political Issues in Britain and Europe|last=Meredith|first=Philip|year=1989|pages=100–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject is usually started in kindergarten and continues cumulatively throughout the student's entire schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boethius|first=Carl|year=1986|title=Sex Education in Swedish Schools: The Facts and the Fiction|journal=Family Planning Perspectives|volume=17|issue=6|pages=276–279|doi=10.2307/2135318|jstor=2135318|pmid=3842667}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sexual education is incorporated into different subjects such as biology and history.&lt;ref name="swedsexed"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012173851/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,978575-2,00.html Sex Has Many Accents] ''TIME''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Swedish Association for Sexuality Education]] (RFSU) has a sex education that emphasizes "sexual diversity, freedom and enjoyment",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thanem|first=Torkild|year=2010|title=Free At Last?

Alongside this emphasis of sexual diversity, Swedish sex education has equal incorporations of lesbian and gay sexuality as well as heterosexual sexuality. They provide knowledge about masturbation, oral and anal sex as well as heterosexual, genital intercourse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Switzerland====
In Switzerland, the content and amount of sex education is decided at the [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantonal]] level. In [[Geneva]], courses have been given at the secondary level first for girls since 1926 and compulsory programs have been implemented at secondary level for all classes since the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Gentiane Burgermeister, Education sexuelle en milieu scolaire, l’expérience genevoise; '' Int. J. Pub. Health, (1972) 17; 1; 53–57''.&lt;/ref&gt; In most French-speaking cantons since the 1970s, generalized courses have been implemented by states with duly formed and trained specialists working within school health services at the secondary level.

Interventions in primary schools were started during the 1980s, with the basic objective of empowering children, strengthening their resources, and giving the capacity to discriminate what is right or wrong based upon what is and is not allowed by law and society. They are also given knowledge of their own rights, told that they can have their own feelings about themselves, and informed on whom to talk to in case they feel uncomfortable about a private matter and wish to talk about it.

Finally, the objectives include an enforcement of their capacity to decide for themselves and their ability to express their feelings about a situation and say "no". In secondary schools, there are programs at ages 13–14 and 16–17 with the basic objective to give students a secure moment with caring, well-informed adults. With confidentiality and mutual respect, students can talk to an adult who understands youth needs and what they should know about sexual life in [[conformity]] with age and maturity.

In the German part of the country, the situation is somewhat different. Sex education as a school implemented program is a fairly recent subject, the responsibility given to school teachers. Though federal structures give authority to each state to decide, there are efforts, notably under the auspices of {{Lang|fr|Santé sexuelle Suisse}} – the Swiss branch of IPPF ([[International Planned Parenthood Federation]]) – to look for and propose possible models of application which take into account all factors of sex education according to their different levels of concern, parents, teachers, and external experts.

=====England and Wales=====
[[Cecil Reddie]] ran the first sex education course at a British school in October 1889 at [[Abbotsholme School]] but the lessons were only for sex between married couples.&lt;ref name="hammill"/&gt;

In [[England and Wales]], Sex and relationships education (&lt;abbr&gt;[[Sex and Relationships Education|SRE]]&lt;/abbr&gt;) is compulsory since 1976, in part, from age 11 onwards. It involves teaching children about reproduction, sexuality and sexual health. It does not promote early sexual activity or any particular sexual orientation. The compulsory parts of sex and relationships education are the elements contained within the national curriculum for science.

=====Scotland=====
The main sex education programme in [[Scotland]] is ''Healthy Respect'', which focuses not only on the biological aspects of reproduction but also on relationships and emotions. Education about [[Birth control|contraception]] and [[sexually transmitted diseases]] are included in the programme as a way of encouraging good sexual health. In response to a refusal by Catholic schools to commit to the programme, however, a separate sex education programme has been developed for use in those schools. Funded by the [[Scottish Government]], the programme ''Called to Love'' focuses on encouraging children to delay sex until marriage, and does not cover contraception, and as such is a form of [[abstinence-only sex education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scmo.org/articles/507/1/Cardinal-praises-dedication-and-commitment-of-Catholic-teachers/Page1.html |title=Cardinal praises "dedication and commitment" of Catholic teachers |publisher=Scmo.org |date=April 30, 2008 |access-date=August 5, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620082038/http://scmo.org/articles/507/1/Cardinal-praises-dedication-and-commitment-of-Catholic-teachers/Page1.html |archive-date=June 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex education is required in 30 states, 28 of which also require HIV education. 9 more states require just HIV education. Only 18 states require the information taught to be medically accurate by law. 37 states allow parents to opt their kids out of their Sex Ed. 19 states require instruction that sexual activity should only occur in marriage and 28 states require that abstinence be stressed.

For example, a 1999 study by the [[Guttmacher Institute]] found that most U.S. sex education courses in grades 7 through 12 cover puberty, HIV, [[Sexually Transmitted Infection|STI]]s, [[abstinence]], implications of [[teenage pregnancy]], and how to resist [[peer pressure]]. Other studied topics, such as methods of [[birth control]] and infection prevention, [[sexual orientation]], [[sexual abuse]], and factual and ethical information about abortion, varied more widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author2=Jacqueline E.

====Australia====
The [[Government of Victoria]] (Australia) developed a policy for the promotion of ''Health and Human Relations Education'' in schools in 1980 that was introduced into the State's primary and secondary schools during 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/HealthAndHumanRelationsEducation/HealthAndHumanRelationsEducation#page/n0/mode/1up |title=Health and Human Relations Education |access-date=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative was developed and implemented by the Honorable [[Norman Lacy]] MP, Minister for Educational Services from 1979 to 1982.

A ''Consultative Council for Health and Human Relations Education'' was established in December 1980 under the chairmanship of Dame [[Margaret Blackwood]]; its members possessed considerable expertise in the area.

The council had three major functions:
# to advise and to be consulted on all aspects of Health and Human Relations' Education in schools;
# to develop, for consideration of the Government, appropriate curriculum for schools;
# to advise and recommend the standards for in-service courses for teachers and relevant members of the school community.

Support services for the Consultative Council were provided by a new Health and Human Relations Unit within the Special Services Division of the Education Department of Victoria and was responsible for the implementation of the Government's policy and guidelines in this area. The Unit advised principals, school councils, teachers, parents, tertiary institutions and others in all aspects of ''Health and Human Relations Education''.

In 1981 the Consultative Council recommended the adoption of a set of guidelines for the provision of ''Health and Human Relations Education'' in schools as well as a Curriculum Statement to assist schools in the development of their programs. These were presented to the Victorian Cabinet in December 1981 and adopted as government policy.

As of March 2021, a program called "[[Respectful Relationships]]" was a core part of Victoria's curriculum, and was to become mandatory in all state schools. Students will also be specifically taught about consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-21/consent-education-to-become-mandatory-in-victorian-state-schools/100019522|title=Consent education to become mandatory in Victorian state schools|newspaper=ABC News|date=March 21, 2021|via=www.abc.net.au|access-date=March 21, 2021|archive-date=March 22, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210322001243/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-21/consent-education-to-become-mandatory-in-victorian-state-schools/100019522|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand, sexuality education is part of the Health and Physical Education curriculum, which is compulsory for the first ten years of schooling (Years 1 to 10) but optional beyond that. Sexual and reproductive health education begins at Year 7 (approximately age 11), although broader issues such as physical, emotional and social development, personal and interpersonal skills, and (non-sexual) relationships begin as early as Year 1 (approximately age 5).&lt;ref name="NZMoE"&gt;{{cite book |title= Sexuality Education: Revised Guide for Principals, Boards of Trustees, and Teachers |author= Ministry of Education |year= 2002 |location= Wellington |publisher= Learning Media |isbn= 0478267274 |url= http://health.tki.org.nz/content/download/1748/18347/file/Sexed+guide.pdf |access-date= June 26, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150121051529/http://health.tki.org.nz/content/download/1748/18347/file/Sexed+guide.pdf |archive-date= January 21, 2015 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Health/{{Lang|mi|Hauora}} curriculum, including the sexuality education component, is the only part of the New Zealand Curriculum/{{Lang|mi|Te Matauranga o Aotearoa}} (the former for English-medium schools, the latter for Māori-medium schools) in which state and [[state-integrated school]]s must legally consult with the school community regarding its delivery, and the consultations must occur at least once every two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0080/latest/DLM179262.html |title= Section 60B: Consultation about treatment of health curriculum – Education Act 1989 – New Zealand Legislation |publisher= Parliamentary Counsel Office |access-date= June 26, 2013 |archive-date= December 9, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131209032028/http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0080/latest/DLM179262.html |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents can ask for their children to be removed from the sexuality education component of the health curriculum for any reason, provided they apply in writing to the school principal, and do so at least 24 hours beforehand so alternative arrangements can be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0080/latest/DLM178247.html |title= Section 25AA: Release from tuition in specified parts of health curriculum – Education Act 1989 – New Zealand Legislation |publisher= Parliamentary Counsel Office |access-date= June 26, 2013 |archive-date= November 3, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121103194416/http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0080/latest/DLM178247.html |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not prevent a teacher answering sexuality education questions if a student, excluded or not, asks them.&lt;ref name="NZMoE" /&gt;

== Opposing sides regarding the ethics of sexuality ==
There are two opposing sides of the sex education argument among parents. Sexual liberals see knowledge on sex as equipping individuals to make informed decisions about their personal sexuality, and they are in favor of comprehensive sexual education all throughout schooling, not just in high school. Sexual conservatives see knowledge on sex as encouraging adolescents to have sex, and they believe that sex should be taught inside the family for their morals to be included in the conversation. Sexual conservatives see the importance of teaching sex education, but only through [[Abstinence-only sex education|abstinence-only]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Sex Goes To School: Warring Views on Sex- And Sex Education- Since The Sixties|last=Luker|first=Kristen|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another viewpoint on sex education, historically inspired by sexologists such as [[Wilhelm Reich]] and psychologists such as [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[James W. Prescott]], holds that what is at stake in sex education is control over the body and liberation from social control. Proponents of this view tend to see the political question as whether society or the individual should teach sexual [[mores]]. Sexual education may thus be seen as providing individuals with the knowledge necessary to liberate themselves from socially organized [[sexual oppression]] and to make up their own minds. In addition, sexual oppression may be viewed as socially harmful. Sex and relationship experts like Reid Mihalko of "Reid About Sex"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reidaboutsex.com/|title=ReidAboutSex — Sex and Relationship Expert Reid Mihalko's official site|access-date=March 13, 2017|archive-date=March 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325182312/http://reidaboutsex.com/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that open dialogue about physical intimacy and health education can generate more self-esteem, self-confidence, humor, and general health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mihalko|first=Reid|title=About Reid|url=http://reidaboutsex.com/about-reid/|work=Reid About Sex|access-date=June 3, 2011|archive-date=June 9, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609074859/http://reidaboutsex.com/about-reid/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim that certain sex education curricula break down pre-existing notions of [[modesty]] or encourage acceptance of what they consider immoral practices, such as homosexuality or [[premarital sex]]. Naturally, those that believe that homosexuality and premarital sex are a normal part of the range of human sexuality disagree with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Shackelford |first=Katherine Grace |title=Abstinence discourses, practices and sexual literacy at a small, Christian church in Central Texas |oclc=1099182508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many religions teach that sexual behavior outside of marriage is immoral and/or psychologically damaging, and many adherents desire this morality to be taught as a part of sex education. They may believe that sexual knowledge is necessary, or simply unavoidable, hence their preference for curricula based on [[abstinence]].&lt;ref&gt;PBS, February 4, 2005 [https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week823/feature.html Religion &amp; Ethics Newsweekly, Episode 823] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310182953/https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week823/feature.html |date=March 10, 2012 }} Accessed December 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual Health Website Evaluation Studies ==
Research conducted in the 2010–20 shows the effectiveness of digital sexual health interventions for young adults. The [[Systematic review|systematic literature review]] examined 9881 records and assessed 61 studies, showing that phones are the leading  way to deliver cognitive and behavioral results related to sexual health. Tools identified as the most popular mechanisms for sexual health promotion were: interactive websites, text messaging, phone calls, and online education programs. In evaluating the impact of these interventions, the review highlighted the importance of robust research designs, such as randomized controlled trials.&lt;ref&gt;Sewak, A., Yousef, M., Deshpande, S., Seydel, T., &amp; Hashemi, N. (2023). The effectiveness of digital sexual health interventions for young adults: a systematic literature review (2010–2020). ''Health Promotion International'', ''38''(1), daac104.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reliability of the information on [[Sexual Health]] remains a concern. A study focusing on websites that adolescents tend to access when seeking online sexual health information revealed the differences in reliability of those online resources. The study focused on websites based in the US such as: Planned Parenthood and [[WebMD]]. While [[Planned Parenthood]] was found to be the most well-rounded website, concerns about the reliability of some websites remain.&lt;ref&gt;Whiteley, L. B., Mello, J., Hunt, O., &amp; Brown, L. K. (2012). A review of sexual health web sites for adolescents. ''Clinical pediatrics'', ''51''(3), 209–213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study focused on the quality of online sexual health resources accessed by young people. It found that the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] had the highest reliability score, while [[Planned Parenthood]] and [[WebMD]] scored higher in usability.&lt;ref&gt;Diez, S. L., Fava, N. M., Fernandez, S. B., &amp; Mendel, W. E. (2022). Sexual health education: the untapped and unmeasured potential of US-based websites. ''Sex Education'', ''22''(3), 335–347.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both these studies highlight the importance of online resources promoting sexual health in being easily accessible and trustworthy. 

A study examined the accessibility of sex education content online. The research was a keyword search which resulted in identifying 41 relevant web pages. A surprising finding was that 63% of the pages were classified as pornography. This study highlights the difficulties and challenges that surround sexual health website evaluation studies.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M., Gertz, E., Alvarez, S., &amp; Lurie, P. (2000). The content and accessibility of sex education information on the Internet. ''[[Health Education &amp; Behavior]]'', ''27''(6), 684–694.&lt;/ref&gt;

==LGBT sex education==
{{Main|LGBT sex education}}
One major source of controversy in the realm of sex education is whether LGBT sex education should be integrated into school curricula.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; LGBT sex education includes inclusive teaching of safe sex practices for lesbian, [[Gay men|gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] individuals and general instruction in topics related to [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]]. Studies have shown that many schools do not offer such education today.&lt;ref name="Formby"/&gt; Five states (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas) have laws in place that ban teaching LGBT sex education. Only 20% of LGBT students have heard anything positive about their community and they reported in a 2011 [[Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network]] (GLSEN) report that they were more likely to hear positive information about LGBT people from a history or social studies class rather than a health class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kosciw|first=J.G.|year=2012|title=The 2011 National School Climate Survey: The experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth in our nation's schools|journal=Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six states (California, Colorado, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington) enforce sex education curricula that includes LGBT information beginning 2020. Beyond states, the District of Columbia has also moved to offer curricula that supports the involvement of LGBT sexual education.

An example of LGBT-inclusive curriculum is introduced by the National Sexuality Education Standards set forth by the Future of Sex Education Initiative. These education standards outline seven core topics that must be addressed in sex education; one of those core topics is identity. The identity topic presents lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender identities as possibilities for students as they progress through life and come to understand who they are. These standards, the Future of Sex Education argues, will start in kindergarten and will evolve into more complex topics throughout schooling as the students mature and age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGarry|first=Robert|year=2013|title=Build a curriculum that includes everyone: ensuring that schools are more accepting of LGBT students and issues requires more than passing mentions of diversity in sex education classes|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=EAIM&amp;id=GALE%7CA320848233&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon&amp;userGroup=lom_umichanna&amp;authCount=1|journal=Phi Delta Kappan|volume=94|issue=5|doi=10.1177/003172171309400506|s2cid=144659807|access-date=June 4, 2023|archive-date=June 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200606205909/https://galeapps.gale.com/apps/auth?userGroupName=&amp;sid=summon&amp;origURL=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.gale.com%2Fps%2Fi.do%3Fp%3DEAIM%26id%3DGALE%257CA320848233%26v%3D2.1%26it%3Dr%26sid%3Dsummon%26userGroup%3Dlom_umichanna%26authCount%3D1&amp;prodId=EAIM|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, BigTalk Education's Growing Up Safe programme, which includes LGBT relationship education from Primary School age, was awarded the 2017 Pamela Sheridan award for innovation and good practice in relationships and sex education (RSE), services and projects for young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fpa.org.uk/awards/pamela-sheridan-award|title=Pamela Sheridan Award|date=2013-04-24|work=FPA|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012074138/https://www.fpa.org.uk/awards/pamela-sheridan-award|archive-date=October 12, 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-LGBT ===

Opponents often argue that teaching LGBT sex education would be disrespectful to some religions&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Janofsky|first=Michael|title=Gay Rights Battlefields Spread to Public Schools|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/09/education/09clash.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|work=The New York Times|date=June 9, 2005|access-date=November 2, 2013|archive-date=June 7, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200607051620/https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/09/education/gay-rights-battlefields-spread-to-public-schools.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expose students to inappropriate topics.&lt;ref name="Formby"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Formby|first=Eleanor|title=Sex and relationships education, sexual health, and lesbian, gay and bisexual sexual cultures: views from young people|journal=Sex Education|date=August 2011|volume=11|issue=3|pages=255–266|doi=10.1080/14681811.2011.590078|s2cid=144342450|url=http://shura.shu.ac.uk/3848/1/Formby_sex_and_relationships.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://shura.shu.ac.uk/3848/1/Formby_sex_and_relationships.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They say that including homosexuality in the curriculum would violate parents' rights to control what their children are exposed to and that schools should not inflict a particular political view on students.&lt;ref name="Christian Post"&gt;{{cite web|last=Villalva|first=Brittney|title=Sex Education in Schools Should Include a Gay Agenda, Report Claims|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/sex-education-in-schools-should-include-a-gay-agenda-report-claims-66976/|work=The Christian Post|date=January 12, 2012|access-date=November 2, 2013|archive-date=July 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701001713/http://www.christianpost.com/news/sex-education-in-schools-should-include-a-gay-agenda-report-claims-66976/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, many sex education curricula do not include LGBT topics, and research has reported that students often feel that they do not receive adequate instruction in LGBT sex topics.&lt;ref name="Formby" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Viv|author2=High |title=Something More to Tell You: Lesbian, Gay, or Bisexual Young Peoples|journal=Journal of Adolescence|date=April 2004|volume=30|issue=2|pages=213–225|doi=10.1080/0141192042000195281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parental rights in education ===
Recently, some  states have opted to restrict topics about LGBT matter and people. One of the most controversial laws passed has been labeled the "Don't Say Gay" law that has most recently been passed in Florida. The bill seeks to ban gender and sexuality issues being presented to students while in lower grade school in efforts to allow parents to make the decision as to when or if they will introduce their child to Gender and Sexuality subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Diaz |first=Jaclyn |date=2022-03-28 |title=Florida's governor signs controversial law opponents dubbed 'Don't Say Gay' |language=en |work=NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/2022/03/28/1089221657/dont-say-gay-florida-desantis |access-date=2022-03-29 |archive-date=April 26, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230426031531/https://www.npr.org/2022/03/28/1089221657/dont-say-gay-florida-desantis |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
