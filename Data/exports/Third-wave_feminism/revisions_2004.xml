Unlike [[second-wave feminism]], which largely focused on the inclusion of [[women]] in traditionally [[male]]-dominated areas, third-wave feminism seeks to challenge and expand common definitions of [[gender]] and [[sexuality]].

Traits of third-wave feminism include [[queer theory]], [[women-of-color consciousness]], [[post-colonialism]], [[critical theory]], [[transnationalism]], and new [[feminist theory]].  In particular, a [[post-structuralist]] interpretation of gender and sexuality is center to third-wave feminism.

A comprehensive example of third-wave feminism is ''Colonize This!'', an anthology of writings by young women discussing issues like gender, [[racism]], [[nationalism]], and queer identity.
