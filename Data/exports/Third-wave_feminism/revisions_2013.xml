{{Feminism sidebar |History}}

'''Third-wave feminism''' is a term identified with several diverse strains of [[Feminism|feminist]] activity and study, whose exact boundaries in the [[historiography]] of feminism are a subject of debate, but are often marked as beginning in the early 1990s and continuing to the present. The movement arose as a response to the perceived failures of and backlash against initiatives and movements created by [[second-wave feminism]] during the 1960s to 1980s, and the realization that women are of "many colors, ethnicities, nationalities, religions and cultural backgrounds".&lt;ref name="Tong"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tong|first=Rosemarie|title=Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction|year=2009|edition=Third|publisher=[[Westview Press]]|location=[[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]]|isbn=978-0-8133-4375-4|oclc=156811918|pages=284–285, 289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Third-wave feminism seeks to challenge or avoid what it deems the second wave's [[Essentialism|essentialist]] definitions of [[femininity]], which often assumed a universal female identity and over-emphasized the experiences of upper-middle-class white women. The shift from second wave feminism came about with many of the legal and institutional rights that were given to women. In addition to these institutional gains, third-wave feminists believed there needed to be further changes in stereotypes of women and in the media portrayals of women as well as in the language that has been used to define women. Therefore, third-wave ideology focuses on a more [[post-structuralist]] interpretation of gender and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hardin|first=Marie|coauthors=Whiteside, Erin|chapter=From Second - Wave to Poststructuralist Feminism|title=The International Encyclopedia of Media Studies: Media Effects/Media Psychology|year=2013|doi=10.1002/9781444361506.wbiems991|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781444361506.wbiems991/pdf|publisher=Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Deconstructing Equality-versus-Difference:  Or, the Uses of Poststructuralist Theory for Feminism," [[Joan W. Scott]] describes how language has been used as a way to understand the world, however, "post-structuralists insist that words and texts have no fixed or intrinsic meanings, that there is no transparent or self-evident relationship between them and either ideas or things, no basic or ultimate correspondence between language and the world"&lt;ref&gt;W. Scott, Joan. (1941). "Deconstructing Equality-versus-Difference:  Or, the Uses of Poststructuralist Theory for Feminism."&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while language has been used to create binaries (such as male/female), post-structuralists see these binaries as artificial constructs created to maintain the power of dominant groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Poststructural feminism in education: An overview|journal=International Journal of Qualitative Studies in Education|year=2000|volume=13|issue=5|pages=477–515|doi=10.1080/09518390050156422|author=Elizabeth Adams St. Pierre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements==
Third-wave theory usually incorporates elements of [[queer theory]]; [[anti-racism]] and [[person of color|women-of-color]] consciousness; [[womanism]]; [[girl power]]; [[post-colonial theory]]; [[postmodernism]]; [[transnationalism]]; [[cyberfeminism]]; [[ecofeminism]]; [[individualist feminism]]; new [[feminist theory]], [[transgender]] politics, and a rejection of the [[gender binary]]. Also considered part of the third wave is [[Sex-positive feminism|sex-positivity]], a celebration of [[female human sexuality|sexuality]] as a positive aspect of life, with broader definitions of what [[sex]] means and what [[oppression]] and [[empowerment]] may imply in the context of sex. For example, many third-wave feminists have reconsidered the opposition to [[pornography]] and [[sex work]] of the second wave, and challenge existing beliefs that participants in pornography and sex work are always being exploited.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{Cite book|editor-last=Johnson|editor-first=Merri Lisa|title=Jane Sexes It Up: True Confessions of Feminist Desire|year=2002|publisher=[[Four Walls Eight Windows]]|location=New York|isbn=978-1-56858-180-4|oclc=49515674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New generations and feminism==
Third-wave feminists such as Elle Green often focus on "micro-politics", and challenge the second wave's paradigm as to what is, or is not, good for women.&lt;ref name="Freedman"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Freedman|first=Estelle B. |title=No Turning Back: The History of Feminism and the Future of Women|year=2002 |publisher=[[Ballantine Books]] |location=London| oclc=49193867}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Henry|first=Astrid |title=Not My Mother's Sister: Generational Conflict and Third-Wave Feminism|year=2004|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |location=[[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] |oclc=53932637}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillis"&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Gillis| editor-first=Stacy|editor2-last=Howie| editor2-first=Gillian| editor3-last=Munford| editor3-first=Rebecca |title=Third Wave Feminism: A Critical Exploration|edition=Expanded Second| year=2007| publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|location=[[Basingstoke]] |isbn=978-0-230-52174-2| oclc=77795615}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Faludi"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Faludi| first=Susan| title=Backlash: The Undeclared War Against Women |year=1991 |publisher=[[Crown Publishing Group]] |location=New York| isbn=978-0-517-57698-4| oclc=23016353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of third-wave feminism claim that it allows women to define [[feminism]] for themselves by incorporating their own identities into the belief system of what feminism is and what it can become through one's own perspective. In the introduction to the idea of third-wave feminism in ''Manifesta'', authors [[Jennifer Baumgardner]] and [[Amy Richards]] suggest that feminism can change with every generation and individual:

{{quote|The fact that feminism is no longer limited to arenas where we expect to see it—[[National Organization for Women|NOW]], ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'', [[women's studies]], and redsuited [[Member of Congress|congresswomen]]—perhaps means that young women today have really reaped what feminism has sown. Raised after [[Title IX]] and ''[[William's Doll|William Wants a Doll]]'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[sic]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, young women emerged from college or high school or two years of marriage or their first job and began challenging some of the received wisdom of the past ten or twenty years of feminism. We're not doing feminism the same way that the seventies feminists did it; being liberated doesn't mean copying what came before but finding one's own way-- a way that is genuine to one's own generation.&lt;ref name="Baumgardner_Richards" /&gt;}}

Some third-wave feminists prefer not to call themselves feminists, as the word ''feminist'' can be misinterpreted as insensitive to the [[transgender|fluid notion of gender]] and the potential [[oppression]]s inherent in all [[gender roles]], or perhaps misconstrued as exclusive or elitist by critics.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Others have kept and redefined the term to include these ideas.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Third-wave feminism seeks to challenge any universal definition of femininity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} In the introduction of ''To Be Real: Telling the Truth and Changing the Face of Feminism'', the Third Wave Foundation founder and leader [[Rebecca Walker]] writes:

{{quote|Whether the young women who refuse the feminist label realize it or not, on some level they recognize that an ideal woman born of prevalent notions of how empowered women look, act, or think is simply another impossible contrivance of perfect womanhood, another scripted role to perform in the name of biology and virtue.&lt;ref name="Walker" /&gt;}}

==Challenges==
Third-wave feminism deals with issues that seem to limit or oppress women, as well as other marginalized identities. [[Consciousness-raising]] activism, which is "the collective critical reconstitution of the meaning of women’s social experience, as women live through it"&lt;ref&gt;A. Mackinnon, Catharine. (1991). "Toward A Feminist Theory of the State." Harvard University press.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} In their book ''Manifesta: Young Women, Feminism and the Future'', [[Jennifer Baumgardner]] and [[Amy Richards]] write:

{{quote|Consciousness among women is what caused this [change], and consciousness, one's ability to open their mind to the fact that male domination does affect the women of our generation, is what we need... The presence of feminism in our lives is taken for granted. For our generation, feminism is like fluoride. We scarcely notice we have it—it's simply in the water.&lt;ref name="Baumgardner_Richards" /&gt;}}

Feminist scholars such as [[Shira Tarrant]] object to the "wave construct" because it ignores important progress between the so-called waves. Furthermore, if feminism is a global movement, the fact that the "first-, second-, and third waves time periods correspond most closely to American feminist developments" raises serious problems about how feminism recognizes the history of political issues around the world.&lt;ref name="Tarrant"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tarrant|first=Shira|title=When Sex Became Gender|page=222|year=2006|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-95347-4|oclc=62281555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably, the biggest challenge to the efforts of third-wave feminism is the decline in popular support for the relevance and importance of feminism in what some claim is the "post-feminist" era. Manon Tremblay refers to this phenomenon as the "antifeminist undercurrent" of the West. Here, a concern for what Amy Friedman calls third-wave feminism's "radical fanaticism" is expressed.&lt;ref name="tremblay"&gt;Tremblay, Manon. "Gender and Society: Rights and Realities." Canada and the United States: Differences that Count. Ed. David Thomas. Peterborough: Broadview Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the claim is that gender equality has already been achieved via the first two waves, and that further attempts to push for women's rights are either irrelevant and unnecessary, or are excessively pushing the pendulum towards advantaging women over men and exaggerating the state of women in modern western society. Indeed, we see this very issue manifesting itself in the heated debates over whether or not affirmative action initiatives really are creating societal gender equality, or are actually disadvantaging/punishing white, middle-class, males for a biological history that they have merely inherited.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Jacquetta A., and Linda A. White. Women, Politics, and Public Policy: The Political Struggles of Canadian Women. Don Mills, Ont.: Oxford UP, 2012. 14-15. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to such sentiments, we can trace many previously self-proclaimed feminists crossing the floor to becoming self-proclaimed post-feminists, claiming that the strands of feminism extant today are out of sync with the reality of the success story of women's gains.&lt;ref name="steenbergen"&gt;Steenbergen, Candis (2001). [http://search.proquest.com.ezproxy.library.uvic.ca/docview/217455651 "Feminism and Young Women: Alive and Well and Still Kicking"]. Retrieved on 5 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The popular media has played a large role in propounding this image of crazy, radical, lunatic feminists. Donna LaFromboise is known for accusing third-wave feminism of having "perpetuated the myth of female martyrdom, stated that feminists have deliberately maintained such fictions to ensure its survival, and differentiated between "a feminism that informs one's opinions and a feminism that dictates how one should think"".&lt;ref name="laframboise"&gt;LaFramboise, Donna (1996). [http://www.quillandquire.com/reviews/review.cfm?review_id=1009%3Cbr%3E%3C/a%3E "The Princess at the Window: A New Gender Morality"]. Retrieved on 5 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The target of such attacks are the rather notoriously extremist feminists such as [[Catherine MacKinnon]], [[Andrea Dworkin]] etc., thus it can be argued that such a critique isn't actually hitting the mark with regards to third-wave feminism as a whole, but is merely overgeneralizing based on a limited sample.&lt;ref name="steenbergen" /&gt;

== History ==
Third-wave feminism began in the early 1990s, arising as a response to perceived failures of the second wave and to address the backlash against initiatives and movements created by the second wave. However, the fundamental rights and programs gained by feminist activists of the second wave - including the creation of domestic-abuse shelters for women and children and the acknowledgment of abuse and rape of women on a public level, access to contraception and other reproductive services (including the legalization of abortion), the creation and enforcement of sexual-harassment policies for women in the workplace, child-care services, equal or greater educational and extracurricular funding for young women, [[women's studies]] programs, and much more—have also served as a foundation and a tool for third-wave feminists.
Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave like [[Gloria Anzaldúa]], [[bell hooks]], Kerry Ann Kane, [[Cherríe Moraga]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Maxine Hong Kingston]], [[Reena Walker]] and many other feminists of color, sought to negotiate a space within feminist thought for consideration of subjects related to race.&lt;ref name="Gillis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Heywood"&gt;{{Cite book|editor-last=Heywood|editor-first=Leslie|editor2-last=Drake|editor2-first=Jennifer|title=Third Wave Agenda: Being Feminist, Doing Feminism|year=1997|publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]]|location=[[Minneapolis]]|isbn=978-0-8166-3005-9|oclc=36876149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, [[Cherríe Moraga]] and [[Gloria E. Anzaldúa]] published the anthology ''[[This Bridge Called My Back]],'' which, along with ''All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men, But Some of Us Are Brave: Black Women's Studies'' (1982), critiqued second-wave feminism, which focused primarily on the problems and political positions of white women.

The roots of the third wave began, however, in the mid-1980s. Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave called for a new subjectivity in feminist voice. They sought to negotiate prominent space within feminist thought for consideration of race-related subjectivities. This focus on the intersection between race and gender remained prominent through the Hill-Thomas hearings, but was perceived{{By whom|date=August 2010}} to shift with the [[Freedom Ride 1992]], the first project of the Walker-led Third Wave Direct Action Corporation. This drive to register voters in poor minority communities was surrounded with rhetoric that focused on rallying young women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Hayes Taylor | first=Kimberly | title=Feminism reaches the next generation—Walker underscores need for inclusion, change in 'third wave' | newspaper=[[Star Tribune]] | date =  March 8, 1995 | page=1B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Khanna.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kathleen Hanna]] was the lead singer of [[Bikini Kill]]: a [[riot grrrl]] band formed in 1990.]]
In the early 1990s, the [[Riot grrrl]] movement began in [[Olympia, Washington]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]. It sought to give women the power to control their voices and artistic expressions.&lt;ref name="Rowe-Finbeiner" /&gt; Its links to social and political issues are where the beginnings of the third-wave feminism can be seen. The music and zine writings produced are strong examples of "cultural politics in action, with strong women giving voice to important social issues though an empowered, female oriented community, many people link the emergence of the third-wave feminism to this time".&lt;ref name="Rowe-Finbeiner" /&gt; The movement encouraged and made "adolescent girls' standpoints central", allowing them to express themselves fully.&lt;ref name="Code"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Feminist Theories |last=Code |first=Lorraine |authorlink= |year=2000 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[London]] |isbn=0-415-30885-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was grounded in the [[DIY ethic|DIY philosophy]] of [[Punk ideologies#Punk ethics|punk values]], riot grrrls took an [[anti-corporate]] stance of [[self-sufficiency]] and [[Individualism|self-reliance]].&lt;ref name="Rowe-Finbeiner"&gt;{{cite book |title=The F-Word |last=Rowe-Finkbeiner |first=Kristin |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=[[Seal Press]] |location=[[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]] |isbn=978-1-58005-114-9 |url= |accessdate=| oclc=55504351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riot grrrl's emphasis on universal female identity and separatism often appears more closely allied with second-wave feminism than with the third wave.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg_Garofalo"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Jessica |last2=Garofalo |first2=Gitana |year=1998 |title=Riot Grrrl: Revolutions from Within |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |volume=23 |issue=3: Feminisms and Youth Cultures |pages=809–841 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |doi=10.1086/495289 |url= |accessdate= |oclc=486795617 |issn=0097-9740 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Riot grrrl bands often address issues such as rape, domestic abuse, sexuality, and female empowerment. Some bands associated with the movement are: [[Bikini Kill]], [[Bratmobile]], [[Excuse 17]], [[Jack Off Jill]], [[Free Kitten]], [[Heavens to Betsy]], [[Huggy Bear (band)|Huggy Bear]], [[Fifth Column (band)|Fifth Column]] and [[Team Dresch]]. In addition to a music scene, riot grrrl is also a [[subculture]]: [[zines]], the DIY ethic, art, political action, and activism are part of the movement. Riot grrrls hold meetings, start chapters, and support and organize women in music.&lt;ref name="Schilt"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schilt |first=Kristen |year=2003 |title=A Little Too Ironic: The Appropriation and Packaging of Riot Grrrl Politics by Mainstream Female Musicians |journal=Popular Music and Society |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=5–16 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |doi=10.1080/0300776032000076351 |url=http://www.public.asu.edu/~kleong/staffpage/course/riottgrrl%20analysis.pdf |accessdate=18 April 2011 |oclc=360399883 |issn=0300-7766 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Riot Grrrl'' uses a "growling" double or triple ''r'', placing it in the word ''girl'' as an appropriation of the perceived derogatory use of the term.&lt;ref name="Rowe-Finbeiner" /&gt;

In 1991, [[Anita Hill]] accused [[Clarence Thomas]], a man nominated to the [[United States Supreme Court]], of [[sexual harassment]]. Thomas denied the accusations and, after extensive debate, the [[United States Senate]] voted 52–48 in favor of Thomas.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Walker|first=Rebecca|title=To Be Real: Telling the Truth and Changing the Face of Feminism|year=1995|publisher=[[Anchor Books]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-385-47262-3|oclc=32274323}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heywood" /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gillis|first=Stacy|last2=Howie|first2=Gillian|last3=Munford|first3=Rebecca|title=Third Wave Feminism: A Critical Exploration|year=2004|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|isbn=978-1-4039-1821-5|oclc=54454680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to this case, [[Rebecca Walker]] published an article entitled "Becoming the Third Wave" in which she stated, "I am not a post-feminism feminist. I am the third-wave."&lt;ref name="Walker1992"&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Rebecca| first1 = Walker| authorlink1 = Rebecca Walker| editor-last=| editor-first =| editor-link=| date = | year = 1992| month = January/February| title = Becoming the Third Wave| journal = [[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]| issue = | pages = 39–41| location = New York| publisher = Liberty Media for Women| issn = 0047-8318| oclc = 194419734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the "[[Year of the Woman]]" saw four women enter the [[United States Senate]] to join the two already there. The following year another woman ([[Kay Bailey Hutchison]]) won a special election, bringing the number to seven. The 1990s also saw the first female [[Attorney General of the United States|United States Attorney General]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], as well as the [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|second woman on the Supreme Court]], and the first US [[First Lady]] ([[Hillary Rodham Clinton]]) to have an independent political, legal, corporate executive, activist, and public service career. However, the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], which is supported by second- and third-wave feminists, remains a work in progress.

Third-wave feminists have recently utilized the internet and modern technology to enhance their movement, which have allowed for information and organization to reach a larger audience.
{{quote|The increasing ease of publishing on the Internet meant that e-zines (electronic magazines) and blogs became ubiquitous. Many serious independent writers, not to mention organizations, found that the Internet offered a forum for the exchange of information and the publication of essays and videos that made their point to a potentially huge audience. The Internet radically democratized the content of the feminist movement with respect to participants, aesthetics, and issues&lt;ref name="Brunell, Laura 2008"&gt;Brunell, Laura.  2008.

==Prominent issues==

===Gender violence===
Gender violence has become a central issue for third-wave feminists. Organizations such as [[V-Day (movement)|V-Day]], have formed with the goal of ending gender violence, and artistic expressions such as ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'' have generated awareness and action around issues relating to women's sexuality. Third-wave feminists want to transform the traditional notions of sexuality and embrace “an exploration of women’s feelings about sexuality that included vagina-centred topics as diverse as orgasm, birth, and rape."&lt;ref name="Brunell, Laura 2008"/&gt;

===Reproductive rights===
{{Main|Reproductive rights}}

One of feminism's primary concerns is reproductive rights, such as access to contraception and abortion. According to Baumgardner and Richards, "It is not feminism's goal to control any woman's fertility, only to free each woman to control her own".&lt;ref name="Baumgardner_Richards"&gt;{{cite book |title=Manifesta: Young Women, Feminism, and the Future |last1=Baumgardner |first1=Jennifer |author1-link=Jennifer Baumgardner |last2=Richards |first2=Amy |author2-link=Amy Richards |year=2000 |publisher=[[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=978-0-374-52622-1 |oclc=43607358 |page=  |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Dakota's 2006 attempt to ban [[abortion]] in all cases, except when necessary to protect the mother's life,&lt;ref name="Davey"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Davey |first=Monica |title=South Dakota Bans Abortion, Setting Up a Battle | newspaper= New York Times |volume=155 |issue=53511 |pages=A1–A14 |date=7 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the US Supreme Court's recent vote to uphold the [[partial birth abortion]] ban are viewed by many feminists as restrictions on women's civil and reproductive rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Ludlow | first = Jeannie | title=Sometimes, It's a Child and a Choice: Toward an Embodied Abortion Praxis | journal=[[NWSA Journal]]| volume=20 | issue= 1 | pages=26–50 | date=Spring 2008| oclc=364432908}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Weitz | first1=Tracy A.| last2=Yanow | first2=Susan | title=Implications of the Federal Abortion Ban for Women's Health in the United States| journal=Reproductive Health Matters |volume=16 |issue=31 |pages=99–107 |year= 2008 |month=May | doi=10.1016/S0968-8080(08)31374-3 | pmid=18772090 | oclc=282104847}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictions on the 1973 Supreme Court decision in ''[[Roe v.

===Reclaiming derogatory terms===
English-speakers continue to use words such as ''[[spinster]]'', ''bitch'', ''[[whore]]'', and ''cunt'' to refer to women in derogatory ways.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} [[Inga Muscio]] writes, "I posit that we're free to seize a word that was kidnapped and co-opted in a pain-filled, distant, past, with a ransom that cost our grandmothers' freedom, children, traditions, pride, and land." Third-wave feminists prefer to change the connotation of a sexist word rather than censor it from speech.

Part of taking back the word ''bitch'' was fueled by the 1994 single, "[[All Women Are Bitches]]" by the all-woman band [[Fifth Column (band)|Fifth Column]], and, later, by the 1999 book ''Bitch: In Praise of Difficult Women'' by [[Elizabeth Wurtzel]]. In the successful declaration of the word ''bitch'', Wurtzel introduces her philosophy:  "I intend to scream, shout, race the engine, call when I feel like it, throw tantrums in Bloomingdale's if I feel like it and confess intimate details about my life to complete strangers. I intend to do what I want to do and be whom I want to be and answer only to myself: that is, quite simply, the bitch philosophy."&lt;ref name="Wurtzel 1998"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wurtzel|first=Elizabeth|title=Bitch: In Praise of Difficult Women|page=|year=1998|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-385-48400-8|oclc=38144418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rape===
{{Main|SlutWalk}}
Since 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SlutWalk Toronto: What|url=http://www.slutwalktoronto.com/about/what|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the utility of the reclamation strategy has been a hot topic among third-wave feminists with the advent of [[SlutWalk]]s.

===Other issues===
Third-wave feminism's central issues are that of race, social class, and sexuality. However, there are also concerns of workplace issues such as the [[glass ceiling]], [[sexual harassment]], unfair [[maternity leave]] policies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first = Frank | last=Munden | title=Female medical workers feel maternity leave unfair| journal=The Kapi'o Newspress | volume=36 | issue=28|date= 7 May 2003|url=http://kapio.kcc.hawaii.edu/archive/v36/36_28/nurse.html| archiveurl=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090228075410/http://kapio.kcc.hawaii.edu/archive/v36/36_28/nurse.html| archivedate=28 February 2009| accessdate=14 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; motherhood—support for [[single mother]]s by means of [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] and [[child care]] and respect for working mothers and mothers who decide to leave their [[career]]s to raise their children full-time.

Third-wave feminism is often associated with the emergence of, so-called, "lipstick" or "girly" feminisms and the rise of "raunch culture". This is because these new feminisms advocated for “expressions of femininity and female sexuality as a challenge to objectification".&lt;ref name="Newman &amp; White 2012 246"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman &amp; White|title=Women, Politics, and Public Policy: The Political Struggles of Canadian Women|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Toronto|page=246|edition=2nd|chapter=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, this included the dismissal of any restriction, whether deemed patriarchal or feminist, to define or control how women or girls can dress, act, or generally express themselves.&lt;ref name="Newman &amp; White 2012 246"/&gt; These emerging positions stood in stark contrast with the [[Feminist views of pornography|anti-pornography]] strains of feminism prevalent in the 1980s. These new feminisms posit that the ability to make autonomous choices about self-expression can be an empowering act of resistance, not simply internalized oppression. However, such views have been critiqued because of the subjective nature of [[empowerment]] and autonomy. Scholars are unsure if empowerment is best measured as an “internal feeling of power and agency" or an external "measure of power and control".&lt;ref name="Newman &amp; White 2012 247"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman &amp; White|title=Women, Politics, and Public Policy: The Political Struggles of Canadian Women|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Toronto|page=247|edition=2nd|chapter=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, they critique an over-investment in "a model of free will and choice" in the marketplace of identities and ideas.&lt;ref name="Newman &amp; White 2012 247"/&gt; Regardless, the "girly" feminisms attempted to be open to all different selves while maintaining a dialogue about the meaning of identity and femininity in the contemporary world.

These view-points shouldn’t be limited by the label "girly" feminism or regarded as simply advocating for "raunch culture". Rather, these feminisms seek to be inclusive of the many diverse relationships and roles women fulfill. Gender scholars Linda Duits and Liesbet van Zoonen highlight this inclusiveness by looking at the politicization of women’s clothing choices and how the "controversial [[sartorial]] choices of girls" and women are constituted in public discourse as "a locus of necessary regulation".&lt;ref name="Newman &amp; White 2012 246"/&gt; Thus, the "[[hijab]]" and the "[[Crop top|belly shirt]]", as dress choices, are both identified as requiring regulation but for different reasons. The two clothing items of women that have caused a great deal of controversy initially appear to be opposing forms of self-expression. However, through the lens of "girly" feminisms, they can both be viewed as symbolic of "political agency and resistance to objectification".&lt;ref name="Newman &amp; White 2012 247"/&gt; The "hijab" can be seen as an act of resistance against western ambivalence towards Islamic identity, while the "belly shirt" can be viewed as an act of resistance towards patriarchal society’s narrow views of female sexuality: Both are regarded as valid forms of self-expression.&lt;ref name="Newman &amp; White 2012 247"/&gt;

==Internationally==
[[Layli Miller-Muro]] founded the [[Tahirih Justice Center]] in 1997 following a [[Matter of Kasinga|well-publicized asylum case]] in which she was involved as a student attorney dealing with [[female genital mutilation]].&lt;ref name="case"&gt;Fauziya Kassindja, ''Do They Hear You When You Cry.'' p. 171. The case name became ''Matter of Kasinga'', because Fauziya did not know if it was proper to correct the immigration official who misspelled her last name on her entry into the United States.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller-Muro later co-wrote a book with the client she had aided and used her portion of the proceeds for the initial funding of Tahirih. As of 2012, the organization had assisted more than 13,000 women and children fleeing from a wide variety of abuses.&lt;ref name="services"&gt;[http://www.tahirih.org/services/ Services] ''Tahirih Justice Center'', Retrieved June 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The organization played a significant role in the passage of the [[International Marriage Broker Regulation Act]] (IMBRA), which was signed by [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] in early 2006 and incorporated into the [[Violence Against Women Act]] (VAWA).  IMBRA gives foreign women important information about prospective American husbands (for a summary, see also [[Mail-order bride#Legal issues|Mail-order bride, Legal issues]]).

== Criticisms ==
One issue raised by critics is the lack of a single cause for third-wave feminism. The first wave fought for and gained the right for women to vote. The second wave struggled to obtain the right for women to have access and equal opportunity to the workforce, as well as ending of legal sex discrimination.&lt;ref name="Rowe-Finbeiner" /&gt;

The third wave of feminism, some argue, lacks a cohesive goal, and it is often seen as an extension of the second wave.&lt;ref name="Rowe-Finbeiner" /&gt; Also, third-wave feminism does not have a set definition that can distinguish itself from second-wave feminism. Some argue the third wave can be dubbed the "Second Wave, Part Two" when it comes to the politics of feminism, and "only young feminist culture as truly third wave".&lt;ref name="Baumgardner_Richards" /&gt;

Amy Richards defines the feminist culture for this generation as "third wave because it's an expression of having grown up with feminism".&lt;ref name="Rowe-Finbeiner" /&gt; Second-wave feminists grew up where the politics intertwined within the culture, such as "Kennedy, the Vietnam War, civil rights, and women's rights"; while the third wave sprang from a culture of "punk-rock, hip-hop, 'zines, products, consumerism and the Internet".&lt;ref name="Baumgardner_Richards" /&gt;

In an essay entitled "Generations, Academic Feminists in dialogue" [[Diane Elam]] writes:

{{quote|This problem manifests itself when senior feminists insist that junior feminists be good daughters, defending the same kind of feminism their mothers advocated. Questions and criticisms are allowed, but only if they proceed from the approved brand of feminism. Daughters are not allowed to invent new ways of thinking and doing feminism for themselves; feminists’ politics should take the same shape that it has always assumed.&lt;ref name="Baumgardner_Richards" /&gt;}}

[[Rebecca Walker]], in ''To Be Real'', writes about her fear of rejection by her mother (author [[Alice Walker]]) and by her godmother ([[Gloria Steinem]]) for challenging their views:

{{quote|Young Women feminists find themselves watching their speech and tone in their works so as not to upset their elder feminist mothers. There is a definite gap among feminists who consider themselves to be second-wave and those who would label themselves as third-wave. Although, the age criteria for second-wave feminists and third-wave feminists is murky, younger feminists definitely have a hard time proving themselves worthy as feminist scholars and activists.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Cite book|last=Walker |first=Rebecca |authorlink=Rebecca Walker |title=To Be Real: Telling the Truth and Changing the Face of Feminism |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[Anchor Books]] |year=1995| isbn=978-0-385-47262-3| oclc=32274323}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
