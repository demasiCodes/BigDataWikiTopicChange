'''Third-wave feminism''' refers to several diverse strains of [[Feminism|feminist]] activity and study, whose exact boundaries in the history of feminism are a subject of debate, but are generally marked as beginning in the early 1990s and continuing to the present. It is referred to as an "individual movement", because part of the purpose is to redefine what it is to be a feminist. This movement is usually perceived as a reaction to or continuation of second wave feminism.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beingfeministblog.wordpress.com/2013/05/16/todays-feminism-a-brief-look-at-third-wave-feminism/|title=Today's Feminism: A Brief Look at Third-Wave Feminims|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement arose partially as a response to the perceived failures of and backlash against initiatives and movements created by [[second-wave feminism]] during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, and the perception that women are of "many colors, ethnicities, nationalities, religions, and cultural backgrounds". This wave of feminism partially destabilized constructs from second-wave feminism. It attempts to expand the topic of feminism to include a diverse group of women with a diverse set of identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hewitt|first1=Nancy|title=No Permanent Waves|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-4724-4|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tong"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tong |first=Rosemarie |title=Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction |year=2009 |edition=Third |publisher=[[Westview Press]] |location=[[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] |isbn=978-0-8133-4375-4 |oclc=156811918 |pages=284–285, 289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term intersectionality was coined in 1989, a few years before third wave began, they embraced this concept during this wave.  

[[Rebecca Walker]] coined the term to highlight the third wave's focus on [[queer]] and non-white women.&lt;ref name="about.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Third-Wave Feminism|url = http://civilliberty.about.com/od/gendersexuality/p/third_wave.htm|website = About.com|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, she published an article in response to the Anita Hill case, about how she is sick of women being silenced and men using their privilege to get away with sexual harassment and other forms of oppression. In the end she states "I am not a post feminism feminist. I am the Third Wave." &lt;ref name="Walker1992"/&gt; Walker wanted to establish that third wave feminism is not just a reaction, but a movement in itself, because women's issues were far from over. Third-wave feminists have broadened their goals, focusing on ideas like [[queer theory]], and abolishing gender role expectations and stereotypes.&lt;ref name=SNYDER&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Snyder|first1=R. Claire|title=What Is Third‐Wave Feminism?

ISBN 0-9621849-0-X. OCLC 233530845)&lt;/ref&gt; third-wave feminists were rather ambiguous and divided about these themes ([[feminist sex wars]]).&lt;ref name=LAMB&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lamb|first1=Sharon|title=Feminist Ideals for a Healthy Female Adolescent Sexuality: A Critique|journal=Sex Roles|date=4 October 2009|volume=62|issue=5-6|pages=294–306|doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9698-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some thought these sexual acts were degrading and oppressing women, others saw it as empowering that women were owning their sexuality.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There was a divide in opinion but third wave feminism embraced differences, personal narratives, and individualism, instead of all having one agenda; in exception to a few topics, such as rape culture or equal pay. Their focus was less on political changes and more on individualistic identity.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Purpose==
The shift from second wave feminism came about with many of the legal and institutional rights that were extended to women. In addition to these institutional gains, third-wave feminists believed there needed to be further changes in stereotypes, media portrayals, and language to define women. The purpose was to celebrate diverse identities and abandon the "victim feminism" ideology, which was enforced in second wave feminism.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rachelyon1.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/third-wave-feminism.pdf|title=Third Wave feminism and individualism: promoting equality or reinforcing the status quo|last=Iannello|first=K.P|date=|year=1998|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third-wave ideology focuses on a more [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] interpretation of gender and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hardin|first=Marie|author2=Whiteside, Erin|chapter=From Second-Wave to Poststructuralist Feminism|title=The International Encyclopedia of Media Studies: Media Effects/Media Psychology|year=2013|doi=10.1002/9781444361506.wbiems991|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781444361506.wbiems991/pdf|publisher=Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Deconstructing Equality-versus-Difference: Or, the Uses of Poststructuralist Theory for Feminism," [[Joan W.

(2) Respect and appreciation for experiences and dynamic knowledge. (3) An understanding of ‘the personal is political’ that incorporates both the idea that personal experiences have roots in structural problems and the idea that responsible, individuated personal action has social consequences. (4) Use of personal narratives in both theorizing and political activism. (5) Political activism as local, with global connections and consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Local is Global: Third Wave Feminism, Peace, and Social Justice|journal=Contemporary Justice Review|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New generations and feminism==
[[Riot grrrl]] was thought by some to be the beginning of third wave feminism. This was a movement based on hard core punk rock that talked about issues like rape, patriarchy, sexuality, women empowerment, and other feminist issues. They responded to the Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas court case as well.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Third-wave feminists such as Elle Green often focus on "micro-politics", and challenge the second wave's paradigm as to what is, or is not, good for women.&lt;ref name="Freedman"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Freedman|first=Estelle B. |title=No Turning Back: The History of Feminism and the Future of Women|year=2002 |publisher=[[Ballantine Books]] |location=London| oclc=49193867}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Henry|first=Astrid |title=Not My Mother's Sister: Generational Conflict and Third-Wave Feminism|year=2004|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |location=[[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] |oclc=53932637}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillis"&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Gillis| editor-first=Stacy|editor2-last=Howie| editor2-first=Gillian| editor3-last=Munford| editor3-first=Rebecca |title=Third Wave Feminism: A Critical Exploration|edition=Expanded Second| year=2007| publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|location=[[Basingstoke]] |isbn=978-0-230-52174-2| oclc=77795615}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Faludi"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Faludi| first=Susan| title=Backlash: The Undeclared War Against Women |year=1991 |publisher=[[Crown Publishing Group]] |location=New York| isbn=978-0-517-57698-4| oclc=23016353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of third-wave feminism claim that it allows women to define [[feminism]] for themselves by incorporating their own identities into the belief system of what feminism is and what it can become through one's own perspective. In the introduction to the idea of third-wave feminism in ''Manifesta'', authors [[Jennifer Baumgardner]] and [[Amy Richards]] suggest that feminism can change with every generation and individual:

{{quote|The fact that feminism is no longer limited to arenas where we expect to see it – [[National Organization for Women|NOW]], ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'', [[women's studies]], and redsuited [[Member of Congress|congresswomen]] – perhaps means that young women today have really reaped what feminism has sown. Raised after [[Title IX]] and ''[[William's Doll|William Wants a Doll]]'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[sic]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, young women emerged from college or high school or two years of marriage or their first job and began challenging some of the received wisdom of the past ten or twenty years of feminism. We're not doing feminism the same way that the seventies feminists did it; being liberated doesn't mean copying what came before but finding one's own way – a way that is genuine to one's own generation.&lt;ref name="Baumgardner_Richards" /&gt;}}

Some third-wave feminists prefer not to call themselves feminists, as the word ''feminist'' can be misinterpreted as insensitive to the [[transgender|fluid notion of gender]] and the potential [[oppression]]s inherent in all [[gender roles]], or perhaps misconstrued as exclusive or elitist by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/amp/www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/making-sense/column-why-millennial-women-dont-want-to-call-themselves-feminists|title=Column: Why millennial women don't want to call themselves feminists|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=The article doesn't identify the women in question as third-wave feminists, just millennials.|date=October 2016}} Others have kept and redefined the term to include these ideas.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Third-wave feminism seeks to challenge any universal definition of femininity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} In the introduction of ''To Be Real: Telling the Truth and Changing the Face of Feminism'', the Third Wave Foundation founder and leader [[Rebecca Walker]] writes:

{{quote|Whether the young women who refuse the feminist label realize it or not, on some level they recognize that an ideal woman born of prevalent notions of how empowered women look, act, or think is simply another impossible contrivance of perfect womanhood, another scripted role to perform in the name of biology and virtue.&lt;ref name="Walker" /&gt;}}

==Challenges==
Third-wave feminism deals with issues which are perceived to limit or oppress women, as well as other marginalized identities. [[Consciousness-raising]] activism, which has been referred to as "the collective critical reconstitution of the meaning of women's social experience, as women live through it"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacKinnon|first=Catharine A.|year=1989|title=Toward A Feminist Theory of the State|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=83|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Shn5xHywtHIC&amp;q=the+collective+critical+reconstitution+of+the+meaning+of+women%27s+social+experience%2C+as+women+live+through+it#v=snippet&amp;q=the%20collective%20critical%20reconstitution%20of%20the%20meaning%20of%20women%27s%20social%20experience%2C%20as%20women%20live%20through%20it&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their book ''Manifesta: Young Women, Feminism and the Future'', [[Jennifer Baumgardner]] and [[Amy Richards]] write:

{{quote|Consciousness among women is what caused this [change], and consciousness, one's ability to open their mind to the fact that male domination does affect the women of our generation, is what we need... The presence of feminism in our lives is taken for granted. For our generation, feminism is like fluoride. We scarcely notice we have it – it's simply in the water.&lt;ref name="Baumgardner_Richards" /&gt;}}

Feminist scholars such as [[Shira Tarrant]] object to the "wave construct" because it ignores important progress between the so-called waves. Furthermore, if feminism is a global movement, she feels the fact that the "first-, second-, and third waves time periods correspond most closely to American feminist developments" raises serious problems about how feminism recognizes the history of political issues around the world.&lt;ref name="Tarrant"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tarrant|first=Shira|title=When Sex Became Gender|page=222|year=2006|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-95347-4|oclc=62281555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably, the biggest challenge to the efforts of third-wave feminism is the decline in popular support for the relevance and importance of feminism in what some claim is the "post-feminist" era. Manon Tremblay refers to this phenomenon as the "antifeminist undercurrent" of the West. Here, a concern for what Amy Friedman calls third-wave feminism's "radical fanaticism" is expressed.&lt;ref name="tremblay"&gt;Tremblay, Manon. "Gender and Society: Rights and Realities." ''Canada and the United States: Differences that Count''. Ed. David Thomas. Peterborough: Broadview Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the claim is that gender equality has already been achieved via the first two waves, and that further attempts to push for women's rights are either irrelevant and unnecessary, or are excessively pushing the pendulum towards advantaging women over men and exaggerating the state of women in modern western society. This issue is seen manifesting itself in the heated debates over whether or not affirmative action initiatives really are creating societal gender equality, or are actually disadvantaging/punishing white, middle-class, males for a biological history that they have merely inherited.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Jacquetta A., and Linda A. White. ''Women, Politics, and Public Policy: The Political Struggles of Canadian Women''. Don Mills, Ont.: Oxford UP, 2012. 14–15. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Although, in Rebecca Walker's article in ''Ms. Magazine'' challenges this idea. She says "So I write this as a plea to all women, especially the women of my generation: Let Thomas’ confirmation serve to re-mind you, as it did me, that the fight is far from over. Let this dismissal of a woman's experience move you to anger. Turn that outrage into political power."&lt;ref name="Walker1992"/&gt;

In response to such sentiments, we can trace many previously self-proclaimed feminists crossing the floor to becoming self-proclaimed post-feminists, claiming that the strands of feminism extant today are out of sync with the reality of the success story of women's gains.&lt;ref name="steenbergen"&gt;Steenbergen, Candis (2001).

== History ==
Third-wave feminism began in the early 1990s, arising as a response to perceived failures of the second wave and to address the backlash against initiatives and movements created by the second wave. However, the fundamental rights and programs gained by feminist activists of the second wave – including the creation of domestic-abuse shelters for women and children and the acknowledgment of abuse and rape of women on a public level, access to contraception and other reproductive services (including the legalization of abortion), the creation and enforcement of sexual-harassment policies for women in the workplace, child-care services, equal or greater educational and extracurricular funding for young women, [[women's studies]] programs, and much more – have also served as a foundation and a tool for third-wave feminists.
Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave like [[Gloria Anzaldúa]], [[bell hooks]], Kerry Ann Kane, [[Cherríe Moraga]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Maxine Hong Kingston]], [[Reena Walker]] and many other feminists of color, sought to negotiate a space within feminist thought for consideration of subjects related to race.&lt;ref name="Gillis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Heywood"&gt;{{Cite book|editor-last=Heywood|editor-first=Leslie|editor2-last=Drake|editor2-first=Jennifer|title=Third Wave Agenda: Being Feminist, Doing Feminism|year=1997|publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]]|location=[[Minneapolis]]|isbn=978-0-8166-3005-9|oclc=36876149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, [[Cherríe Moraga]] and [[Gloria E. Anzaldúa]] published the anthology ''[[This Bridge Called My Back]],'' which, along with ''All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men, But Some of Us Are Brave: Black Women's Studies'' (1982), critiqued second-wave feminism, which focused primarily on the problems and political positions of white women.

The roots of the third wave began, however, in the mid-1980s. Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave called for a new subjectivity in feminist voice. They sought to negotiate prominent space within feminist thought for consideration of race-related subjectivities. This focus on the intersection between race and gender remained prominent through the Hill-Thomas hearings, but was perceived{{By whom|date=August 2010}} to shift with the [[Freedom Ride 1992]], the first project of the Walker-led Third Wave Direct Action Corporation. This drive to register voters in poor minority communities was surrounded with rhetoric that focused on rallying young women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Hayes Taylor | first=Kimberly | title=Feminism reaches the next generation – Walker underscores need for inclusion, change in 'third wave' | newspaper=[[Star Tribune]] | date = March 8, 1995 | page=1B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, [[Anita Hill]] accused [[Clarence Thomas]], a man nominated to the [[United States Supreme Court]], of [[sexual harassment]]. Thomas denied the accusations and, after extensive debate, the [[United States Senate]] voted 52–48 in favor of Thomas.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Walker|first=Rebecca|title=To Be Real: Telling the Truth and Changing the Face of Feminism|year=1995|publisher=[[Anchor Books]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-385-47262-3|oclc=32274323}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heywood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gillis|first=Stacy|last2=Howie|first2=Gillian|last3=Munford|first3=Rebecca|title=Third Wave Feminism: A Critical Exploration|year=2004|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|isbn=978-1-4039-1821-5|oclc=54454680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to this case, [[Rebecca Walker]] published an article entitled "Becoming the Third Wave" in which she stated, "I am not a post-feminism feminist. I am the third-wave."&lt;ref name="Walker1992"&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Rebecca| first1 = Walker| authorlink1 = Rebecca Walker| editor-last=| editor-first =| editor-link=/February| title = Becoming the Third Wave| journal = [[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]| issue = | pages = 39–41| location = New York| publisher = Liberty Media for Women| issn = 0047-8318| oclc = 194419734|date= January 1992|url=http://www.msmagazine.com/spring2002/BecomingThirdWaveRebeccaWalker.pdf|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the trial, Thomas referred to these accusations as a "high-tech lynching". Many argued Thomas should be acquitted because of his plans to become a Supreme Court Justice and create opportunities for people of color. When Walker asked her partner his opinion and he stated this same concept, she asked: "When will progressive black men prioritize my rights and well-being?"&lt;ref name="Walker1992" /&gt; She wanted equality among races, but without dismissing women; basically, Clarence Thomas was not going to be the last person to run for Supreme Court Justice who pushed civil rights, so why not get someone who respects women?

In 1992, the "[[Year of the Woman]]" saw four women enter the [[United States Senate]] to join the two already there. The following year another woman ([[Kay Bailey Hutchison]]) won a special election, bringing the number to seven. The 1990s also saw the first female [[Attorney General of the United States|United States Attorney General]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], as well as the second woman on the Supreme Court, [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], and the first US [[First Lady]] ([[Hillary Clinton]]) to have an independent political, legal, corporate executive, activist, and public service career. However, the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], which is supported by second- and third-wave feminists, remains a work in progress.

Third-wave feminists have recently utilized the internet and modern technology to enhance their movement, which has allowed for information and organization to reach a larger audience.
{{quote|The increasing ease of publishing on the Internet meant that e-zines (electronic magazines) and blogs became ubiquitous.

==Prominent issues==

===Gender violence===
Gender violence has become a central issue for third-wave feminists. Organizations such as [[V-Day (movement)|V-Day]] have formed with the goal of ending gender violence, and artistic expressions such as ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'' have generated awareness and action around issues relating to women's sexuality. Third-wave feminists want to transform the traditional notions of sexuality and embrace "an exploration of women's feelings about sexuality that included vagina-centred topics as diverse as orgasm, birth, and rape."&lt;ref name="Brunell, Laura 2008" /&gt;

===Reproductive rights===
{{Main article|Reproductive rights}}

One of feminism's primary goals is to demonstrate that access to contraception and abortion are women's reproductive rights. According to Baumgardner and Richards, "It is not feminism's goal to control any woman's fertility, only to free each woman to control her own".&lt;ref name="Baumgardner_Richards"&gt;{{cite book |title=Manifesta: Young Women, Feminism, and the Future |last1=Baumgardner |first1=Jennifer |author1-link=Jennifer Baumgardner |last2=Richards |first2=Amy |author2-link=Amy Richards |year=2000 |publisher=[[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=978-0-374-52622-1 |oclc=43607358 |page= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Dakota's 2006 attempt to ban [[abortion]] in all cases, except when necessary to protect the mother's life,&lt;ref name="Davey"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Davey |first=Monica |title=South Dakota Bans Abortion, Setting Up a Battle | newspaper= New York Times |volume=155 |issue=53511 |pages=A1–A14 |date=7 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the US Supreme Court's recent vote to uphold the [[partial birth abortion]] ban are viewed by many feminists as restrictions on women's civil and reproductive rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Ludlow | first = Jeannie | title=Sometimes, It's a Child and a Choice: Toward an Embodied Abortion Praxis | journal=[[NWSA Journal]]| volume=20 | issue= 1 | pages=26–50 | date=Spring 2008| oclc=364432908 | jstor=40071251}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Weitz | first1=Tracy A.| last2=Yanow | first2=Susan | title=Implications of the Federal Abortion Ban for Women's Health in the United States| journal=Reproductive Health Matters |volume=16 |issue=31 |pages=99–107 |date=May 2008 | doi=10.1016/S0968-8080(08)31374-3 | pmid=18772090 | oclc=282104847 | jstor=25475407}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictions on abortion in the United States, which was mostly legalized by the 1973 Supreme Court decision in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', are becoming more common in states around the country. Such restrictions include mandatory waiting periods,&lt;ref&gt;[[Indiana Code]] [http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title16/ar34/ch2.html#IC16-34-2-1.1 Title 16, art.

===Reclaiming derogatory terms===
English-speakers continue to use words such as ''[[spinster]]'', ''bitch'', ''[[whore]]'', and ''cunt'' to refer to women in derogatory ways. Author [[Inga Muscio]] writes, "I posit that we're free to seize a word that was kidnapped and co-opted in a pain-filled, distant, past, with a ransom that cost our grandmothers' freedom, children, traditions, pride, and land."

Part of taking back the word ''bitch'' was fueled by the 1994 single, "[[All Women Are Bitches]]" by the all-woman band [[Fifth Column (band)|Fifth Column]], and, later, by the 1999 book ''Bitch: In Praise of Difficult Women'' by [[Elizabeth Wurtzel]]. In her declaration of the word ''bitch'', Wurtzel introduces her philosophy: "I intend to scream, shout, race the engine, call when I feel like it, throw tantrums in Bloomingdale's if I feel like it and confess intimate details about my life to complete strangers.

Since 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SlutWalk Toronto: What|url=http://www.slutwalktoronto.com/about/what|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the utility of the reclamation strategy has been a hot topic among third-wave feminists with the introduction of [[SlutWalk]]s. The first SlutWalk took place in Toronto on April 3, 2011, in response to Toronto police officer Michael Sanguinetti's statement that "women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/06/slutwalking-policeman-talk-clothing|title=SlutWalking gets rolling after cop's loose talk about provocative clothing|last=Pilkington|first=Ed|date=2011-05-06|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SlutWalk movement caught on rapidly and additional SlutWalks sprang up internationally with marchers contending a reclamation of the word "slut", their position being that if victimized women are sluts, then all women must be, since anyone can be victimized regardless of what they are wearing.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Slutwalks – Do you agree with the Toronto policeman?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00ggb5t|work=World Have Your Say 60|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; "By marching under the banner of "slut," the protesters take the poison out of the word, to change social attitudes about women's bodies and to empower women with the potential of their own sexualities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=T|year=2013|title=From SlutWalks to SuicideGirls: Feminist Resistance in the Third Wave and Post Feminist Era|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|volume=41 (3/4)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement both empowered women to own their sexuality, be a "slut" if that is what you want, while also discredited Sanguinetti's comment regarding victim blaming. SlutWalks have occurred in over 60 cities internationally, including New York City, Berlin, Seattle, West Hollywood, and London.

===Other issues===
Third-wave feminism regards race, social class, transgender rights, and sexual liberation as central issues. However, it also pays attention to workplace matters such as the [[glass ceiling]], [[sexual harassment]], unfair [[maternity leave|maternity-leave]] policies,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; motherhood – support for [[single mother]]s by means of [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] and [[child care]], respect for working mothers, and also for mothers who decide to leave their [[career]]s to raise their children full-time.

Third-wave feminism is often associated, primarily by critics of third-wave feminism, with the emergence of so-called "lipstick" or "girly" feminists and with the rise of "raunch culture". This is because these new feminists advocated for "expressions of femininity and female sexuality as a challenge to objectification".&lt;ref name="Newman &amp; White 2012 246"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman &amp; White|title=Women, Politics, and Public Policy: The Political Struggles of Canadian Women|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Toronto|page=246|edition=2nd|chapter=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, this included the dismissal of any restriction, whether deemed patriarchal or feminist, to define or control how women or girls should dress, act, or generally express themselves.&lt;ref name="Newman &amp; White 2012 246"/&gt; These emerging positions stood in stark contrast with the [[Feminist views of pornography|anti-pornography]] strains of feminism prevalent in the 1980s. Second wave feminism took on the idea of "victim feminism", which views pornography as excouraging violence towards women.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; These new feminists posit that the ability to make autonomous choices about self-expression can be an empowering act of resistance, not simply internalized oppression. 

However, such views have been critiqued{{by whom|date=July 2014}} because of the subjective nature of [[empowerment]] and autonomy. Scholars are unsure if empowerment is best measured as an "internal feeling of power and agency" or as an external "measure of power and control".&lt;ref name="Newman &amp; White 2012 247"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman &amp; White|title=Women, Politics, and Public Policy: The Political Struggles of Canadian Women|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Toronto|page=247|edition=2nd|chapter=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, they critique an over-investment in "a model of free will and choice" in the marketplace of identities and ideas.&lt;ref name="Newman &amp; White 2012 247"/&gt; Regardless, the "girly" feminists attempted to be open to all different selves while maintaining a dialogue about the meaning of identity and femininity in the contemporary world.

Third-wave Feminists claim that these view-points shouldn't be limited by the label "girly" feminism or regarded as simply advocating for "raunch culture".{{original research inline|date=July 2014}} Rather, they seek to be inclusive of the many diverse relationships and roles women fulfill. Gender scholars [[Linda Duits]] and [[Liesbet van Zoonen]] highlight this inclusiveness by looking at the politicization of women's clothing choices and how the "controversial [[sartorial]] choices of girls" and women are constituted in public discourse as "a locus of necessary regulation".&lt;ref name="Newman &amp; White 2012 246"/&gt; Thus the "[[hijab]]" and the "[[Crop top|belly shirt]]", as dress choices, are both identified as requiring regulation but for different reasons. The two clothing items of women that have caused a great deal of controversy initially appear to be opposing forms of self-expression. However, through the lens of "girly" feminists, one can view both as symbolic of "political agency and resistance to objectification".&lt;ref name="Newman &amp; White 2012 247"/&gt; The "hijab" can be seen as an act of resistance against western ambivalence towards Islamic identity, while the "belly shirt" can be viewed as an act of resistance towards patriarchal society's narrow views of female sexuality: Both are regarded as valid forms of self-expression.&lt;ref name="Newman &amp; White 2012 247"/&gt;

==Internationally==
[[Layli Miller-Muro]] founded the [[Tahirih Justice Center]] in 1997 following a [[Matter of Kasinga|well-publicized asylum case]] in which she was involved as a student attorney dealing with [[female genital mutilation]].&lt;ref name="case"&gt;Fauziya Kassindja, ''Do They Hear You When You Cry.'' p. 171. The case name became ''Matter of Kasinga'', because Fauziya did not know if it was proper to correct the [[immigration]] official who misspelled her last name on her entry into the [[United States]].&lt;/ref&gt; Miller-Muro later co-wrote a book with the client she had aided and used her portion of the proceeds for the initial funding of the center named after [[Táhirih]]. As of 2012, the organization had assisted more than 13,000 [[women]] and [[children]] fleeing from a wide variety of abuses.&lt;ref name="services"&gt;[http://www.tahirih.org/services/ Services] ''Tahirih Justice Center'', Retrieved June 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The organization played a significant role in the passage of the [[International Marriage Broker Regulation Act]] (IMBRA), which was signed by [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] in early 2006 and incorporated into the [[Violence Against Women Act]] (VAWA). IMBRA gives foreign women important information about prospective American husbands (for a summary, see also [[Mail-order bride#Legal issues|Mail-order bride, Legal issues]]).

;Progression of third-wave feminism in Turkey

One major difference of the third wave compared to the first and second was the global reach of feminists to others around the world to gain power and equality within their own cultures and communities using voice as substance.&lt;ref name="about.com"/&gt; In Turkey, the feminist movement is often separated into three separate wave classifications. The first wave dates back to the early 20th century when women faced issues with civil and political rights in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Dubois, Ellen C. ''Woman Suffrage and Women's Rights''. New York University Press, New York. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Şule Toktaş, "The [[Kemalist Turkish invasion of Armenia|Kemalist]] ideal of becoming a Westernized society required legal equality between all citizens irrespective of gender" keeping hand in hand with the ideal of feminists in that era.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Diner|first1=Cagla|last2=Toktaş|first2=Şule|year=2010|title=Waves of feminism in Turkey: Kemalist, Islamist and Kurdishwomen's movements in an era of globalization|journal=Journal of Balkan and Near Eastern Studies|volume=12|issue=1|pages=41–57|doi=10.1080/19448950903507388|url = http://www.academia.edu/5028615/Waves_of_Feminism_in_Turkey_Kemalist_Islamist_and_Kurdish_Women_s_Movements_in_an_Era_of_Globalization}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second wave came much later in 1980, after the [[Coup d'etat in turkey, 1980|military coup d'état]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|first=Adam|last=Leake|date=August 29, 2012|title = A Brief History of the Feminist Movements in Turkey|url = http://www.e-ir.info/2012/08/29/a-brief-history-of-the-feminist-movements-in-turkey/|website = E-International Relations|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in Turkey were subjected to what women in other countries identified as sexist behavior: the scrutinization of women in the media, experiencing [[violence against women]] and making [[Oppression of women|oppression]] of women became more apparent to bystanders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the leftist movements of the 1960s and 1970s, [[Kurdish nationalism|Kurdish]] women were active in politics but struggled with [[socialism]] and being seen as equals in society.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Kurdish Women's Movement: A Third-Wave Feminism Within the Turkish Context.|last = Çaha|first = Ömer|date = September 2011|journal = Turkish Studies|volume=12|issue=3|pages=435–449|doi = 10.1080/14683849.2011.604211|pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Kurdish women argued that their "sexuality and individuality are ignored."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Women that worked were described as sexless militants by Turkish society. Movements in the 1980s focused on the ethnic problems along with socialism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A majority of these Kurdish women stayed at home in what was considered full obedience to their husband. These women, begun to stand up for their rights within the households and society and advocating against sexual oppression.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They struggled against their culture, traditions, and languages.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These struggles laid the foundations for the Kurdish women's movement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The movement for feminism stimulated women in [[Turkey]] to become gender-conscious and to distinguish themselves away from organizations for men as well as create and organize movements and organization with their own identities as feminists in mind.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Today, Islamic women are standing up for their rights of language, culture, and identity, all of which contribute to individuals' recognition as Muslims and characteristics in themselves as feminist.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The third wave came into effect between 1990 and 2000 and is thought to still be in occurrence today. This new wave has been termed by the Turkish Republic as 'Kurdish nationalist feminism.'&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to the Journal of Balkan and Near Eastern Studies, "Kurdish women's groups pinpointed the dual exploitation that Kurdish women have experienced in the patriarchal tribal system dominant in Kurdish culture and the [[imperialist]] system that the centralist Turkish state has imposed on Kurdish people."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [http://www.islam-guide.com Islamic] feminist soon after began condemning the [[United States]] and European countries for their interference of cultural, economic and political notions and how they affect [[Muslim]] society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Badran|first=Margot|title=Between Secular and Islamic Feminism/s: Reﬂactions on the Middle East and Beyond|journal=Journal of Middle East Women's Studies|volume=1|issue=1|year=2005|pages=6–28|jstor=40326847}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic women have since found ways to continue to adhere to the Muslim religion and connect with feminist politics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A Kurdish women's organization, KAMER, is one of the largest feminist organizations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Most of the founders are Kurdish women who have endured violence from men, oftentimes, their husbands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The founders of KAMER understand the difficulties other women continue to face with Kurdish conflict and violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; KAMER has found that it is common for such abuse to occur in the homes of these women. KAMER's goals have extended beyond helping just women and have developed systems that change and improve human rights and end violence culturally and traditionally that affect both women and children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Beyond Kamer, Cagla Diner and Şulecites Toktaş, cited other Kurdish women's organizations such as DIKASUM, Kardelen, Selis and VAKAD which [also] focus on the difﬁculties women face."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Throughout Turkey's feminists movement, feminists of the new era have elected to battle the unequal treatment of women especially in the Muslim community. This time, however, feminists have been seeking to approach the [http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/ gender issues] from a different context by addressing the employment crisis and exploiting the reasons why women receive little economic independence or are not allowed enough involvement in local or national affairs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Adam Leake stated in his article A Brief History of the Feminist Movements in Turkey, "Overcoming these gender-stereotypes of the family orientated mother whose job it is to look after the children is a crucial step towards achieving equal status of women in the community."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Since the 1990s feminist organizations from around Turkey have met up annually to share in a discussion of their goal to stop [[violence against women]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; New proposals and topics such as shelters for women are also discussed during the annual meetings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although both Kurdish and [[Women in Turkey#Feminism|Turkish feminist groups]] are working together, women still face challenges with discrimination and sexism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==

===Lack of cohesion===
One issue often pointed out by critics is the lack of a single cause for third-wave feminism. The first wave fought for and gained the right for women to vote. The second wave struggled for the right for women to have access to and equal opportunity in the workforce, as well as the end of legal sex discrimination.&lt;ref name="Rowe-Finbeiner" /&gt;

The third wave of feminism, some say,{{who|date=October 2016}} lacks a cohesive goal, and it is often seen as an extension of the second wave.&lt;ref name="Rowe-Finbeiner" /&gt; Also, third-wave feminism does not have a set definition distinguishes it from second-wave feminism. Some argue the third wave can be dubbed the "Second Wave, Part Two" when it comes to the politics of feminism, and "only young feminist culture as truly third wave".&lt;ref name="Baumgardner_Richards" /&gt; Some claim that the equation of third wave feminism with individualism prevents the movement from growing and moving towards political goals. Kathleen P. Iannello wrote her thoughts on third wave feminism goals:{{quote|The conceptual and real-world "trap" of choice feminism (between work and home) has led women to challenge each other rather than the patriarchy. Individualism conceived of as "choice" does not empower women; it silences them and prevents feminism from becoming a political movement and addressing the real issues of distribution of resources.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;}}

[[Amy Richards]] defines the feminist culture for this generation is "third wave because it's an expression of having grown up with feminism".&lt;ref name="Rowe-Finbeiner" /&gt; Second-wave feminists grew up where the politics intertwined within the culture, such as "Kennedy, the Vietnam War, civil rights, and women's rights"; while the third wave sprang from a culture of "punk-rock, hip-hop, 'zines, products, consumerism and the Internet".&lt;ref name="Baumgardner_Richards" /&gt;

In an essay entitled "Generations, Academic Feminists in dialogue" [[Diane Elam]] writes:

{{quote|This problem manifests itself when senior feminists insist that junior feminists be good daughters, defending the same kind of feminism their mothers advocated. Questions and criticisms are allowed, but only if they proceed from the approved brand of feminism. Daughters are not allowed to invent new ways of thinking and doing feminism for themselves; feminists' politics should take the same shape that it has always assumed.&lt;ref name="Baumgardner_Richards" /&gt;}}

[[Rebecca Walker]], in ''To Be Real'', writes about her fear of rejection by her mother (author [[Alice Walker]]) and by her godmother ([[Gloria Steinem]]) for challenging their views:

{{quote|Young Women feminists find themselves watching their speech and tone in their works so as not to upset their elder feminist mothers. There is a definite gap among feminists who consider themselves to be second-wave and those who would label themselves as third-wave. Although, the age criteria for second-wave feminists and third-wave feminists is murky, younger feminists definitely have a hard time proving themselves worthy as feminist scholars and activists.&lt;ref name="Walker" /&gt;}}
