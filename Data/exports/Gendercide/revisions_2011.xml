'''Gendercide''' is a [[neologism]] that refers to the systematic killing of members of a specific sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Mary Anne|last=Warren|title=Gendercide: The Implications of Sex Selection|isbn=0847673308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gendercide==

Gendercide is gender-selective mass killing. The term was first used by [[Mary Anne Warren]] in her 1985 book, ''Gendercide: The Implications of Sex Selection''. Warren drew "an analogy between the concept of [[genocide]]" and what she called "gendercide."

==Androcide==

Androcide is the systematic killing of men for various reasons, usually cultural. Androcide may happen during war to reduce an enemy's potential pool of soldiers.

Androcide as a common practice continued in ancient times. Mythological accounts of the Greek takeover of [[Miletus]] in circa 9th century BCE have the legendary son of Poseidon leading a massacre of the men of [[Miletus]] and settling the city in the Milesian men's stead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Miletus 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

Biblical androcides include the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] recounted in the [[Book of Matthew]] although many modern scholars consider that this may be apocryphal &lt;ref&gt;Robert Eisenman, ''James The Brother of Jesus'', 1997, I.3 "Romans, Herodians and Jewish sects" discusses Mariamne, the last representative of the Maccabean line, by whom Herod had two sons, whom he put to death. "Here Herod really did kill all the Jewish children who sought to replace him, as Matthew 2:17 would have it, but these were rather his own children with Maccabean blood!" (p. 49); see also E. P. Sanders, The Historical Figure of Jesus, 87-88&lt;/ref&gt;, and the [[Dinah#The Rape of Dinah|avenging of Dinah]]. 

[[Pakistan]] targeted male intellectuals for extermination in the erstwhile province of [[East Pakistan]] (present day [[Bangladesh]]) during the [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities]].&lt;ref&gt;Rounaq Jahan, "Genocide in Bangladesh", in Samuel Totten et al., eds., Century of Genocide, p298. R.J. Rummel writes: "By November [1971], the rebel guerrillas ... had wrested from the army control over 25 percent of East Pakistan, a success that led the Pakistan army to seek out those especially likely to join the resistance -- young boys. Sweeps were conducted of young men who were never seen again. Bodies of youths would be found in fields, floating down rivers, or near army camps. As can be imagined, this terrorized all young men and their families within reach of the army. Most between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five began to flee from one village to another and toward India. Many of those reluctant to leave their homes were forced to flee by mothers and sisters concerned for their safety." Rummel, Death By Government (New Brunswick, USA: Transaction Publishers, 1994), p329.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pol Pot]] executed many men in [[Cambodia]], resulting in a large percentage of Cambodia's population afterwards being women.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jones |first= Adam |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2000 |month=June |title = Gendercide and Genocide |journal= Journal of Genocide Research |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages= 185–211 |id= |url= |accessdate= 2008-11-09 |quote= |doi=10.1080/713677599 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the [[1984 Anti-Sikh riots]] men were targeted overwhelmingly on account of them being breadwinners of the family.&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt;
More recent examples include the [[1988 Anfal campaign]] against [[Kurds|Kurdish]] men and boys&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/iraq501/events_anfal.html The Crimes of Saddam Hussein]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/reports/1992/iraqkor/KOREME2.htm Koreme Before The Anfal Campaign&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Iraq]] and the [[Srebrenica massacre]] of [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] men and boys on July 12, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/07/ba90ec7e-1d42-43de-88f3-3724c21c2756.html Srebrenica Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4737583 Serbians Still Divided Over Srebrenica Massacre]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Femicide==
{{main|Femicide}}

Femicide is defined as the systematic killing of women for various reasons, usually cultural. The word is attested from the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;2006 Random House Unabridged Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widespread form of femicide is in the form of [[sex-selective infanticide]] in cultures with strong preferences for male offspring.

There have been reports of femicide in [[Guatemala City]], [[Guatemala]], and in [[India]] and [[Ciudad Juárez]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/international/Gender-Violence-in-Mexico.html Femicide and Gender Violence in Mexico], retrieved on May 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Female homicides in Ciudad Juárez|murders in Juarez]], also known as '''las muertas de Juárez''' ("The dead women of Juárez"), and Guatemala were reportedly not investigated by the [[police|local authorities]].
