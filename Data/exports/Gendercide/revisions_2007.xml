{{homicide}}

'''Gendercide''' is a [[neologism]] that refers to the systematic killing of members of a specific [[sex]], either [[male]]s or [[female]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Coined by Mary Anne Warren in her 1985 book ''Gendercide: The Implications of Sex Selection''[http://www.gendercide.org/what_is_gendercide.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The term is intended to be sex-neutral, but it is mostly used in [[feminism]] to refer to female victims ('''feminicide''' or '''femicide'''), though it has also been used to refer to male victims ('''viricide''').

==Male victims==
The systematic killing of men, viricide, happens sometimes during war to reduce an enemy's potential pool of soldiers; this happened for example in the [[1988 Anfal campaign]] against [[Kurds|Kurdish]] men and boys&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/iraq501/events_anfal.html The Crimes of Saddam Hussein]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hrw.org/reports/1992/iraqkor/KOREME2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gendercide.org/case_anfal.html&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Iraq]] and on [[12 July]] [[1995]] during the [[Srebrenica massacre]] of [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] men and [[boy]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/07/ba90ec7e-1d42-43de-88f3-3724c21c2756.html Srebrenica Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4737583 Serbians Still Divided Over Srebrenica Massacre]&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[1984 Anti-Sikh riots]] men were targeted overwhelmingly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gendercide.org/case_kashmir_punjab.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Draft dodgers===
Men who refused to [[conscription]] in the military have been the target of [[forced labor]], [[mutilation]], and [[massacre]] in the nations of Angola, Ethiopia, Iraq, and Russia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gendercide.org/case_conscription.html Case Study:  Military conscription/ Impressment]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Femicide==
Femicide is the systematic [[kill]]ing of [[woman|women]] because they are women. Femicide is seen as a [[gender crime]]. It is attested from the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;2006 Random House Unabridged Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been reports of femicide in [[Guatemala City]], [[Guatemala]], and in [[Ciudad Juarez]], [[Chihuahua]], [[Mexico]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/international/Gender-Violence-in-Mexico.html Femicide and Gender Violence in Mexico], retrieved on May 28th 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[Deaths in Ciudad Juarez|murders in Juarez]], also known as '''las muertas de Juárez''' ("The dead women of Juárez"), and Guatemala were reportedly not investigated by the [[police|local authorities]]. Most of the women were [[rape]]d before being [[murder]]ed and some were [[mutilation|mutilated]], [[torture]]d and [[dismember]]ed. In Guatemala City about 20% of the over 500 women murdered in 2004 and 2005 were killed in pairs, due to an [[lesbian|"intimate relationship"]], according to [[Claudia Acevedo]] of [[Lesbiradas]].{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

There is also concern that femicide of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] women is taking place in [[Canada]]. Five hundred Aboriginal women have been reported missing or murdered since 1980, a disproportionate proportion compared to non-Aboriginal women. According to [[socioecology|sociological studies]], these women are seen as easy targets because their [[race]] places them at the bottom of the social and economic hierarchy. Many of the missing women have been dismissed as [[prostitutes]] and their disappearances have gone uninvestigated. A major factor in bringing international attention to Canadian women was the murder of [[Helen Betty Osborne]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.amnesty.ca/campaigns/resources/amr2000304.pdf Canada: Stolen Sisters: A Human Rights Response to Discrimination and Violence against Indigenous Women in Canada.]" Amnesty International of Canada, 4 Oct. 2004, 30 Oct. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widespread form of femicide is in the form of [[sex-selective infanticide]] in cultures with strong preferences for male offspring, notably in the [[mainland China|mainland]] of the [[People's Republic of China]], [[India]], and [[South Korea]]. These practices result in demographic imbalance with an excess of males.
