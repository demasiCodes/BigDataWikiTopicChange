{{homicide}}
'''Gendercide''' is a [[neologism]] that refers to the systematic killing of members of a specific sex, either males or females.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Mary Anne|last=Warren|title=Gendercide: The Implications of Sex Selection|isbn=0847673308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gendercide==

Gendercide is gender-selective mass killing. The term was first used by [[Mary Anne Warren]] in her 1985 book, ''Gendercide: The Implications of Sex Selection''. Warren drew "an analogy between the concept of [[genocide]]" and what she called "gendercide." Citing the Oxford English Dictionary definition of genocide as "the deliberate [[extermination]] of a race of people," Warren wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;By analogy, gendercide would be the deliberate extermination of persons of a particular sex (or gender). Other terms, such as "gynocide" and "femicide," have been used to refer to the wrongful killing of girls and women. But "gendercide" is a sex-neutral term, in that the victims may be either male or female. There is a need for such a sex-neutral term, since sexually discriminatory killing is just as wrong when the victims happen to be male. The term also calls attention to the fact that gender roles have often had lethal consequences, and that these are in important respects analogous to the lethal consequences of racial, religious, and class prejudice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Warren explored the deliberate extermination of women through analysis of such subjects as female [[infanticide]], [[maternal death]], [[witch-hunts]] in early modern Europe, and other atrocities and abuses against women.

==Femicide==

Femicide is defined as the systematic killing of women for various reasons, usually cultural. Femicide is seen as a [[gender crime]]. The word is attested from the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;2006 Random House Unabridged Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widespread form of femicide is in the form of [[sex-selective infanticide]] in cultures with strong preferences for male offspring.

There have been reports of femicide in [[Guatemala City]], [[Guatemala]], and in [[Ciudad Juárez]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/international/Gender-Violence-in-Mexico.html Femicide and Gender Violence in Mexico], retrieved on May 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Female homicides in Ciudad Juárez|murders in Juarez]], also known as '''las muertas de Juárez''' ("The dead women of Juárez"), and Guatemala were reportedly not investigated by the [[police|local authorities]]. Most of the women were [[rape]]d before being murdered and some were [[mutilation|mutilated]], [[torture]]d, and [[dismember]]ed. In Guatemala City, about 20% of the over 500 women murdered in 2004 and 2005 were killed in pairs, due to a ([[lesbian]]) "intimate relationship", according to [[Claudia Acevedo]] of [[Lesbiradas]].{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

==Viricide==
Viricide is the systematic killing of men for various reasons, usually cultural. Viricide is seen as a [[gender crime]]. Viricide may happen during war to reduce an enemy's potential pool of soldiers.

Perhaps one of the earliest examples of viricide in recorded history occurred some time during the 600s [[BCE]] when Ionian pirates massacred the men of [[Miletus]], forced the Milesian women into marriage with them, and settled the city of Miletus in the Milesian men's stead.&lt;REF&gt;[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Miletus 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been written that forever afterward the Milesian women would neither eat with their husbands nor address them by name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=OvoLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;dq=Miletus+massacre+husbands&amp;source=web&amp;ots=V5fwDBhiCr&amp;sig=toN-KgVTC0PVmC2uV33hcfurDBM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result ''A History of Greece''] by Connop Thirlwall, footnote at page 197.  Accessed November 12, 2008 via Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Cartoon History of the Universe by Larry Gonick Pg. 238&lt;!-- IS THIS A SERIOUS REFERENCE?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famed example of viricide in Western literature is recounted in the [[Book of Matthew]] in the [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]].  If modern scholars are correct in establishing the birth of Jesus as around the year 3 [[BCE]], the slaughter would have taken shortly thereafter.  Matthew 2:16 states that [[Herod]] ordered what is known as the [[Massacre of the Innocents]], which modern scholars note may be apocryphal&lt;ref&gt;Robert Eisenman, ''James The Brother of Jesus'', 1997, I.3 "Romans, Herodians and Jewish sects" discusses Mariamne, the last representative of the Maccabean line, by whom Herod had two sons, whom he put to death. "Here Herod really did kill all the Jewish children who sought to replace him, as Matthew 2:17 would have it, but these were rather his own children with Maccabean blood!" (p. 49); see also E. P. Sanders, The Historical Figure of Jesus, 87-88&lt;/ref&gt; rather than an actual historical event:

{{cquote|Then when Herod saw that he had been tricked by the [[Biblical Magi|magi]], he became very enraged, and sent and slew all the male children who were in Bethlehem and all its vicinity, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined from the magi.|30px|30px|Matthew 2:16|New American Standard Bible}}

[[Pakistan]] targeted male intellectuals for extermination in the erstwhile province of [[East Pakistan]] (present day [[Bangladesh]]) during the [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities]]&lt;ref&gt;Rounaq Jahan, "Genocide in Bangladesh", in Samuel Totten et al., eds., Century of Genocide, p298. R.J. Rummel writes: "By November [1971], the rebel guerrillas ... had wrested from the army control over 25 percent of East Pakistan, a success that led the Pakistan army to seek out those especially likely to join the resistance -- young boys. Sweeps were conducted of young men who were never seen again. Bodies of youths would be found in fields, floating down rivers, or near army camps. As can be imagined, this terrorized all young men and their families within reach of the army. Most between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five began to flee from one village to another and toward India. Many of those reluctant to leave their homes were forced to flee by mothers and sisters concerned for their safety." Rummel, Death By Government (New Brunswick, USA: Transaction Publishers, 1994), p329. &lt;/ref&gt; Male Gendercide was also carried out by [[Pol pot]] in [[Cambodia]], resulting in a large percentage of Cambodia's population afterwards being women.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jones |first= Adam |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2000 |month=June |title = Gendercide and Genocide |journal= Journal of Genocide Research |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages= 185 - 211 |id= |url= |accessdate= 2008-11-09 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the [[1984 Anti-Sikh riots]] men were targeted overwhelmingly on account of them being breadwinners of the family.&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt;
More recent examples include the [[1988 Anfal campaign]] against [[Kurds|Kurdish]] men and boys&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/iraq501/events_anfal.html The Crimes of Saddam Hussein]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/reports/1992/iraqkor/KOREME2.htm Koreme Before The Anfal Campaign&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Iraq]] and the [[Srebrenica massacre]] of [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] men and boys on July 12, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/07/ba90ec7e-1d42-43de-88f3-3724c21c2756.html Srebrenica Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4737583 Serbians Still Divided Over Srebrenica Massacre]&lt;/ref&gt;
