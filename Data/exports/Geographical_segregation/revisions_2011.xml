'''Geographical segregation''' exists whenever the proportions of population rates of two or more [[population]]s are not [[wiktionary:homogenous|homogenous]] throughout a defined space. Populations can be considered any plant or animal [[species]], human [[gender]]s, followers of a certain [[religion]], people of different [[nationalities]], stone types, [[ethnic group]]s, etc.

In [[social geography]] segregation of [[ethnic group]]s, [[social class]]es and genders is often measured by the calculation of indices such as the [[index of dissimilarity]]. Different dimensions of segregation (or its contrary) are recognised: exposure, evenness, clustering, concentration, centralisation, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Massey, D. and Denton, N.
