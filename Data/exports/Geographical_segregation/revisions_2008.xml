Populations can be considered any plant or animal [[species]], human [[gender]]s, followers of a certain [[religion]], people of different [[nationalities]], stone types, [[ethnic group]]s, etc.

In [[social geography]] segregation of [[ethnic groups]], [[social classes]] and genders is often measured by the calculation of indices such as the [[index of dissimilarity ]]. Different dimensions of segregation (or its contrary) are recognised: exposure, evenness, clustering, concentration, centralisation, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Massey, D. and Denton, N.
