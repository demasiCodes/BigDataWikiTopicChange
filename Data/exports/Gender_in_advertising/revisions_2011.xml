Gender displays are used heavily in advertising, and some scholars argue that advertisers are obsessed with gender.&lt;ref name="sut objectification"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jhally|first=Sut|title=What's Wrong With a Little Objectification?|url=http://www.sutjhally.com/articles/whatswrongwithalit/|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike [[Sex and gender distinction |sex]] which is the product of biologically based male-female difference; gender is not natural but rather a [[sociocultural]] construction which refers to the relationship between men and women or [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]]. It is this relationship that advertisers are obsessed with, because gender is how we define ourselves, and gender can be “communicated at a glance,” making it easy for advertisers to use this theme in their work.&lt;ref name="sut objectification"/&gt;

==Creation and maintenance of gender normality==
Gender is constructed and advertising is the tool used to maintain this construction.These gender advertisements give the viewers a glimpse into a world laden with socially defined and constructed gender relations, displays, and roles. Because these images are crafted in a way that mimics real life, many mistake this fantasy world of advertising for the real world. [[Erving Goffman]] would call it “Commercial Realism,when advertisers try to present the advertising world in ways which it could be real.&lt;ref name="Erving Gender"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goffman|first=Erving|title=ERVING GOFFMAN &amp; GENDER ADVERTISEMENTS|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/17244012/Erving-Goffman-and-Gender-Advertisements|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Goffman argues that advertisements do not look strange to us, when they should. Advertisements take something that exists already in the world and they change it, forming a distorted reflection. “They emphasize some things and de-emphasize others,” it is a hyper ritualization of the world, and we recognize, and even relate with some of the images.&lt;ref name="sut objectification"/&gt;

==Role of gender in advertising==
It is argued that these images could be teaching the viewers a vast array of social [[cues]], and even the most subtle ones make an impact on the viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baran|first=Stanley J.|title=Mass communication theory: foundations, ferment, and future|year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=0495503630|pages=318|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5TAebeoDnJ4C&amp;pg=PA318&amp;lpg=PA318&amp;dq=vulnerable+women+and+dominant+men+in+advertising&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qNq6hI_8bb&amp;sig=zFlAIN7ldgTcmRmVOBFghNCU0gg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=05OITszHI7ODsAK2u_m5Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=vulnerable%20women%20and%20dominant%20men%20in%20advertising&amp;f=false|coauthors=Dennis K. Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further it is said that gender relations are learned through advertisements.&lt;ref name="sut objectification"/&gt; Among these learned gender roles are those of [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]]. Men and women are portrayed in advertisements according to the constructed definition of femininity and masculinity. To be a woman is to be feminine and to be a man is to be masculine. There is little room for variation or a reversal of roles, except within the smaller frame of [[niche marketing]].&lt;ref name="MediaEd"/&gt;

===Masculinity in advertising===
In advertising, men are often portrayed in the following ways:&lt;ref name="MediaEd"/&gt;
*Alert and conscious of surroundings
*Standing upright
*Eyes open and looking around
*Bodies are controlled
*Mean expression on face
*Gripping things tightly with hands
*Hands in pockets

"Bravery, adventurousness, being able to think rationally, being strong and effective, for example, are all "manly" traits that are usually encouraged. So also are the ability to think independently and take the initiative. Media images supporting these behaviors include the strong, silent Marlboro man and military ads telling young men to be 'all you can be'."&lt;ref name="CML"&gt;{{cite web|last=Femiano|first=Sam|title=How do Media Images of Men Affect Our Lives?|url=http://www.medialit.org/reading-room/how-do-media-images-men-affect-our-lives|coauthors=Mark Nickerson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Femininity in advertising===
[[File:Guesswomandelicate.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Woman as Delicate, not alert, and Self-touching: Feminine]]

Portrayals of women in advertising:&lt;ref name="MediaEd"/&gt;
*Touching self
*Caressing an object
*Laying on the floor
*Sitting on a bed or chair
*Eyes closed
*Un-alert
*Confused
*Vulnerable
*Body Contorted
*Dressed like a child
*Holding an object/man for support

These are positions of [[submissiveness]] and Powerlessness. This can be clearly seen when women are shown laying on the floor as men are standing over them, literally depicting women as being beneath men.  Women are urged to pursue beauty and sex appeal, and part of the sex appeal is [[submission]].&lt;ref name="CML"/&gt;

==Gender displays in advertising==
"If gender is defined as the [[culturally]] established correlates of sex (whether in consequence of biology or learning) then gender display refers to [[Convention (norm)|conventionalized]] portrayals of those correlates."&lt;ref name="Erving Gender"/&gt; Gender displays can otherwise be defined as [[rituals]] of gender behavior, and they are used to help interpret social reality.&lt;ref name="sut objectification"/&gt; This is what advertising mainly borrows from, and for Goffman this is the reason as to why ads do not look strange to the public.&lt;ref name="sut objectification"/&gt; Further, Goffman argues that there are codes which can be used to identify gender. These codes of gender can be seen in the portrayals of men and women in advertising. There are four categories under which we can see these codes of gender: the family, the feminine touch, the ritualization of [[ subordination]], and licensed withdrawal.&lt;ref name="Erving Gender"/&gt;

===Family===
It is said that grown women are depicted as young children, or [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/infantilization infantilized] in advertising. They are shown with fingers in their mouths and dressed like children or dolls. When a family is shown in advertising, often times the mother resembles the daughter, whereas that is not the case for boys and their fathers.&lt;ref name="MediaEd"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jhally|first=Sut|title=The Codes of Gender|url=http://www.mediaed.org/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&amp;key=238&amp;template=PDGCommTemplates/HTN/Item_Preview.html|publisher=Media Education Foundation|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  “Boys have to push their way into manhood…girls merely have to unfold.”&lt;ref name="Erving Gender"/&gt;

===Feminine touch===
It is argued that in ads women are often seen touching themselves, which is a sign that their body is delicate.&lt;ref name="Erving Gender"/&gt; Women are also depicted as barely touching an object or caressing it, whereas men firmly grasp an object, as if to say that they control over their life, while women are merely there.&lt;ref name="MediaEd"/&gt;

===Licensed withdrawal===
The idea that women in ads are often depicted as confused, un-alert, and mentally drifting for the scene unaware of her surroundings, while men are shown as alert, and prepared to fend off any potential threats.&lt;ref name="Erving Gender"/&gt;

===Ritualization of subordination===
Women are presented as submissive or subordinate to men. This submission can clearly be seen as the women are literally placed below men, and can often be found lying on the floor or on a bed, while men are standing upright, or sitting in a chair.&lt;ref name="Erving Gender"/&gt; Other subordinate gender displays include, head tilt, body tilt, “bashful knee bend,” other canting positions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=Barbie|title=Sexist Advertisements: How to see through the soft sell|url=http://www.medialit.org/reading-room/sexist-advertisements-how-see-through-soft-sell|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; lip biting, holding self, etc. All of these keep a person off-balance and at the mercy of their surroundings, all of these body postures signify submission.
