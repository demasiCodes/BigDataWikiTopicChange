Gender displays are used heavily in advertising in order to establish the role of one gender in relation with the other, and some scholars argue that advertisers are obsessed with gender.&lt;ref name="sut objectification"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jhally|first=Sut|title=What's Wrong With a Little Objectification?|url=http://www.sutjhally.com/articles/whatswrongwithalit/|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike [[Sex and gender distinction|sex]] which is the product of biologically based male-female difference; gender is developed within humans as a result of socialization, and normally correlates very highly with biological sex.  Gender refers to the juxtaposition between men and women or [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]]. It is this relationship that advertisers focus on, because people define themselves by gender, and gender can be “communicated at a glance,” making it easy for advertisers to use this theme in their work.&lt;ref name="sut objectification"/&gt;

==Creation and maintenance of gender normality==

Advertising is a significant agent of socialization in modern industrialized societies, and is used as a tool to maintain certain social constructions, such as gender. Men and women are depicted as differing in attitudes, behavior, and social statuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Belknap|first=Penny|title=A Conceptual Replication and Extension of Erving Goffman' s Study of Gender Advertisements|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n111825536n0v127/fulltext.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2011|coauthors=William Leonard II}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These differences are what separate the sexes into different genders. Gender advertisements give the viewers a glimpse into a world laden with socially defined and constructed gender relations, displays, and roles. These images are crafted to mimic real life and many mistake the concepts of fantasy and reality in regards to advertising. [[Erving Goffman]] would call it “Commercial Realism,when advertisers try to present the advertising world in ways which it could be real.&lt;ref name="Erving Gender"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goffman|first=Erving|title=ERVING GOFFMAN &amp; GENDER ADVERTISEMENTS|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/17244012/Erving-Goffman-and-Gender-Advertisements|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Goffman argues that advertisements do not look strange to us, when they should. Advertisements take something that exists already in the world and they change it, forming a distorted reflection. “They emphasize some things and de-emphasize others,” it is a hyper ritualization of the world, and we recognize, and even relate with some of the images.&lt;ref name="sut objectification"/&gt;

==Role of gender in advertising==
It is argued that these images could be teaching the viewers a vast array of social [[Sensory cue|cues]], and even the most subtle ones make an impact on the viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baran|first=Stanley J.|title=Mass communication theory: foundations, ferment, and future|year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=0-495-50363-0|pages=318|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5TAebeoDnJ4C&amp;pg=PA318&amp;lpg=PA318&amp;dq=vulnerable+women+and+dominant+men+in+advertising&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qNq6hI_8bb&amp;sig=zFlAIN7ldgTcmRmVOBFghNCU0gg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=05OITszHI7ODsAK2u_m5Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=vulnerable%20women%20and%20dominant%20men%20in%20advertising&amp;f=false|coauthors=Dennis K. Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further it is said that gender relations are learned through advertisements.&lt;ref name="sut objectification"/&gt; Among these learned gender roles are those of [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]]. Men and women are portrayed in advertisements according to the constructed definition of femininity and masculinity. To be a woman is to be feminine and to be a man is to be masculine. There is little room for variation or a reversal of roles, except within the smaller frame of [[niche marketing]].&lt;ref name="MediaEd"/&gt;

[[File:Jonathan-rhys-meyers-energie.jpg|thumb|Man as alert, hand in pocket, standing upright, eyes open: Masculine]]

===Masculinity in advertising===
In advertising, men are often portrayed in the following ways:&lt;ref name="MediaEd"/&gt;
*Alert and conscious of surroundings
*Standing upright
*Eyes open and looking around
*Bodies are controlled
*Mean expression on face
*Gripping things tightly with hands
*Hands in pockets
*Serious
*Physically active

"Bravery, adventurousness, being able to think rationally, being strong and effective, for example, are all "manly" traits that are usually encouraged. So also are the ability to think independently and take the initiative. [[Mass media|Media]] images supporting these behaviors include the strong, silent Marlboro man and military ads telling young men to be 'all you can be'."&lt;ref name="CML"&gt;{{cite web|last=Femiano|first=Sam|title=How do Media Images of Men Affect Our Lives?|url=http://www.medialit.org/reading-room/how-do-media-images-men-affect-our-lives|coauthors=Mark Nickerson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social pressure on men to endorse traditional masculinity and sexuality in advertising===
Since the 1980s, men’s bodies have been used more for advertising, depicting a similarly idealized body image to that portrayed of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elliott, R. and C. Elliott (2005)|title=Idealized images of the male body in advertising: a reader‐response exploration.|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/criac/publications/pdf/15_Elliott.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that men feel social pressure to endorse traditional masculine male models in advertising. Research by Martin and Gnoth  (2009) found that feminine men preferred feminine models in private, but stated a preference for the traditional masculine models when their collective self was salient. In other words, when concerned about being classified by other men as feminine, feminine men endorsed traditional masculine models. The authors suggested this result reflected the social pressure on men to endorse traditional masculine norms.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Brett A. S. and Juergen Gnoth (2009), [http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Martin-Gnoth-2009.pdf "Is the Marlboro Man the Only Alternative? The Role of Gender Identity and Self-Construal Salience in Evaluations of Male Models"], ''Marketing Letters'', 20, 353–367.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, a growing number of advertisements are showing men as [[Sex_object|sex objects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kimmel, Allan J. and Elisabeth Tissier-Desbordes (1999)|title=Males, Masculinity, and Consumption: an Exploratory Investigation|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=11390}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study on male body obsession found that advertisements for everything from cars to underwear depicted body-builder images with “washboard abdominal muscles, massive chests, and inflated shoulders, a mixture of muscularity and leanness probably attainable only by drugs.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pope Jr, H. G., K. A. Phillips, and R. Olivardia (2000)|title=The Adonis Complex: The Secret Crisis of Male Body Obsession.|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=175191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though women’s equality is advancing in society, men have become more fixated with muscularity because it is still seen as a cultural symbol of masculinity. In addition, it has been suggested that a muscular body has become an aesthetic norm for [[Heterosexuality|heterosexuals]] as well as [[Homosexual|homosexuals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Connel|first=R.W (1995)|title=Masculinities.|url=http://books.google.ca/books/about/Masculinities.html?id=YuR2uFxxvPoC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Content_analysis|content analysis]] study of exclusively male images in men’s magazines, it was found that most of the bodies in advertising were not ‘ordinary’, but those of strong and hard ‘male figures’. The study showed that males in the advertisements were usually [[Objectification|objectified]] and [[Depersonalization|depersonalized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kolbe, R.H. and P.J. Albanese (1996)|title=Man to man: a content analysis of sole-male images in male audience magazines.|url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/4189016?uid=3739400&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101246160203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The representation of [[Ectomorphic|ectomorphs]] (thin and lightly muscled) was limited predominantly to the advertising of clothing that may look more appealing on slimmer, taller men. [[Endomorphic|Endomorphs]] (soft and round) were rarely depicted and if they were, tended to be the object of humour. It is important to note that representations of male bodies are often used irrespective of their relevance to the product being promoted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patterson, M. and G. England (2000)|title=Body work: depicting the male body in men’s lifestyle
magazines, in: Proceedings of the Academy of Marketing Annual Conference, University of Derby,
CD ROM}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Femininity in advertising===
[[File:Guesswomandelicate.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Woman as delicate, not alert, and self-touching: Feminine]]

Portrayals of women in advertising:&lt;ref name="MediaEd"/&gt;
*Touching self
*Caressing an object
*Lying on the floor
*Sitting on a bed or chair
*Eyes closed
*Not alert
*Confused
*Vulnerable
*Body contorted
*Dressed like a child
*Holding an object or a man for support
*Sexy and sexually available
*Seductive
*Playful

These are positions of [[submissiveness]] and powerlessness. This can be clearly seen when women are shown lying on the floor as men are standing over them, literally depicting women as being beneath men.  Women are urged to pursue beauty and sex appeal, and part of the sex appeal is [[submission]].&lt;ref name="CML"/&gt;

The body – and particularly here the female body – is always inevitably controlled by [[Social_norm|social norms]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Negrin|first=Llewellyn (1999)|title=The self as image - A critical appraisal of postmodern theories of fashion.|url=http://tcs.sagepub.com/content/16/3/99.short}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Commodification|commodification]] of the body through industries such as fashion and beauty that exhibit femininity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doane|first=Mary Ann (1987)|title=The Desire to Desire: The Woman's Film of The 1940s.|url=http://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Desire_to_Desire.html?id=FLWP6SPGQuYC&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The discursive [[Social_construction|constructions]] of these female bodies are quite plainly ‘prepared for [[Consumerism|consumption]]’ by men. These constructions not only reveal the inevitable gender-power relations about the body but also suggest the cultural ambivalence about sexualized bodily display and image management. This sort of ambivalence both idealizes and denigrates individuals' explicitly performed efforts to produce and portray bodies that conform to societal ‘ideals'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malson, H. and C. Swann (1987)|title=Prepared for Consumption: (Dis)orders of Eating and Embodiment.|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=GvNCGwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Prepared+for+Consumption+%E2%80%93+dis(orders)+of+eating&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BOiWUNDuGIfOigLwu4CgAw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender displays in advertising==
[[File:Side by Side.png|thumb|Side-by-side comparison of the differences in gender as portrayed by advertising]]

"If gender is defined as the [[culturally]] established correlates of sex (whether in consequence of biology or learning) then gender display refers to [[Convention (norm)|conventionalized]] portrayals of those correlates."&lt;ref name="Erving Gender"/&gt; Gender displays can otherwise be defined as [[rituals]] of gender behavior, and they are used to help interpret social reality.&lt;ref name="sut objectification"/&gt; This is what advertising mainly borrows from, and for Goffman this is the reason as to why ads do not look strange to the public.&lt;ref name="sut objectification"/&gt; Further, Goffman argues that there are codes which can be used to identify gender. These codes of gender can be seen in the portrayals of men and women in advertising. There are four categories under which we can see these codes of gender: the family, the feminine touch, the ritualization of [[Hierarchy|subordination]], and licensed withdrawal.&lt;ref name="Erving Gender"/&gt;

===Family===
It is said that grown women are depicted as young children, or [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/infantilization infantilized] in advertising. They are shown with fingers in their mouths and dressed like children or dolls. When a family is shown in advertising, oftentimes the mother resembles the daughter, whereas that is not the case for boys and their fathers.&lt;ref name="MediaEd"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jhally|first=Sut|title=The Codes of Gender|url=http://www.mediaed.org/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&amp;key=238&amp;template=PDGCommTemplates/HTN/Item_Preview.html|publisher=Media Education Foundation|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  “Boys have to push their way into manhood…girls merely have to unfold.”&lt;ref name="Erving Gender"/&gt;

===Feminine touch===
It is argued that in ads women are often seen touching themselves, which is a sign that their body is delicate.&lt;ref name="Erving Gender"/&gt; Women are also depicted as barely touching an object or caressing it, whereas men firmly grasp an object, as if to say that they control over their life, while women are merely there.&lt;ref name="MediaEd"/&gt;

===Licensed withdrawal===
The idea that women in ads are often depicted as confused, un-alert, and mentally drifting for the scene unaware of her surroundings, while men are shown as alert, and prepared to fend off any potential threats.&lt;ref name="Erving Gender"/&gt;

===Ritualization of subordination===
Women are presented as submissive or subordinate to men. This submission can clearly be seen as the women are literally placed below men, and can often be found lying on the floor or on a bed, while men are standing upright, or sitting in a chair.&lt;ref name="Erving Gender"/&gt; Other subordinate gender displays include, head tilt, body tilt, “bashful knee bend,” other canting positions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=Barbie|title=Sexist Advertisements: How to see through the soft sell|url=http://www.medialit.org/reading-room/sexist-advertisements-how-see-through-soft-sell|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; lip biting, holding self, etc. All of these keep a person off-balance and at the mercy of their surroundings, all of these body postures signify submission.

==The Twist: Role reversal==
Sometimes the traditional gender roles are reversed. When this happens, one can see men behaving in ways that are generally associated with femininity, and women behaving in typically masculine ways. This is often the case in [http://www.genderads.com/page7/gays/gays.html gay] and [http://www.genderads.com/page7/lesbians/lesbians.html lesbian] advertising. Witnessing these ads can be a shock to most, as they are not accustomed to this reversal of roles. This is an indicator that there is in fact a distinction between the genders in advertising.&lt;ref name="MediaEd"/&gt;

==The body in consumer culture==
Within [[Consumerism|consumer culture]], the body is celebrated as a site of pleasure. It is desirable and desiring and the closer the body is to the idealized images of youth, health, fitness, and beauty, the higher its [[Exchange_value|exchange value]]. Consumer culture allows for the unabashed display of the human body. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Featherstone|first=Mike (1982)|title=The Body in Consumer Culture.|url=http://tcs.sagepub.com/content/1/2/18|page numbers=21-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In modern times, clothing is designed to glorify the ’natural’ human physique, a stark contrast to the 19th century in which clothes were created to conceal the body. Victorian male garments (see [[Victorian_fashion|Victorian fashion]]), loose fitting and conservative in subdued colours, reflected the emphasis for respectability of the male body. Victorian women had to be squeezed into corsets to accentuate the hourglass figure despite the vigorous propaganda against tight-lacing. In the bedroom, the naked body was not considered a source of beauty and joy—sex should take place in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Featherstone|first=Mike (1982)|title=The Body in Consumer Culture.|url=http://tcs.sagepub.com/content/1/2/18|page number=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, with the rise of consumer culture in [[United_States_of_America|America]] after [[World_War_II|World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The American Consumer - The Rise Of The Consumer Culture, Contemporary Consumer Spending, Rising Debt, Decreasing Savings, And Stagnating Incomes.|url=http://www.libraryindex.com/pages/126/American-Consumer.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the body was no longer an embodiment of sin but [[Secularized|secularized]] and found increasingly in contexts for display both inside and outside the bedroom. Furthermore, the cultural popularity of the outdoor [[California|Californian]] lifestyle and warm climate destinations has made leisure clothing and thus, the exposure of the human body, more acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Featherstone|first=Mike (1982)|title=The Body in Consumer Culture.|url=http://tcs.sagepub.com/content/1/2/18|page number=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
