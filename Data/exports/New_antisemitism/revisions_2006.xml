Proponents of the concept argue that [[anti-Americanism]], [[anti-Zionism]], [[Third-worldism|third worldism]] and opposition to the existence of the [[State of Israel]] as a Jewish homeland are coupled with antisemitism, or constitute disguised antisemitism. &lt;ref name=Taguieff/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenbaum/&gt; Critics of the concept argue that it serves to equate legitimate criticism of [[Israel]] with antisemitism, and that it is sometimes used to silence debate. &lt;ref name=Klug&gt;Klug, Brian.

==History==
An early use of the concept in close to its modern form was in the late 1940s, when the [[Soviet Union]] was accused of pursuing a "new anti-Semitism" against Jews, of the sort manifested in the so-called [[Doctors' plot]], a supposed conspiracy by Jewish doctors to poison the Soviet leadership. &lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Solomon M. "The New Anti-Semitism of the Soviet Union," ''Commentary'', June 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stalinist]] opposition to "[[rootless cosmopolitan]]s" &amp;ndash; a euphemism for Jews &amp;ndash; was rooted in the belief, as expressed by [[Klement Gottwald]], that "treason and espionage infiltrate the ranks of the Communist Party. This channel is [[Zionism]]." &lt;ref&gt;''Pravda'', November 21, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

French philosopher [[Pierre-André Taguieff]] writes that the first wave of the new antisemitism emerged in the Arab-Muslim world and the Soviet sphere following the 1967 [[Six Day War]], citing papers by Jacques Givet (1968) and historian [[Léon Poliakov]] (1969) in which the idea of a new anti-Semitism rooted in anti-Zionism was discussed. &lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre-André Taguieff]] cites the following early works on the new antisemitism: Jacques Givet, ''La Gauche contre Israel? Essai sur le néo-antisémitisme, Paris 1968; idem, "Contre une certain gauche," ''Les Nouveaux Cahiers'', No. 13-14, Spring-Summer 1968, pp. 116-119; Léon Poliakov, ''De l'antisionisme a l'antisémitisme, Paris 1969; Shmuel Ettinger, "Le caractère de l'antisémitisme contemporain," ''Dispersion et Unité'', No. 14, 1975, pp. 141-157; and Michael Curtis, ed., ''Antisemitism in the Modern World, Boulder, 1986. All cited in [[Pierre-André Taguieff]]. ''Rising from the Muck: The New Anti-Semitism in Europe''. Ivan R. Dee, 2004, p. 159-160, footnote 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that anti-Jewish themes centered on the demonical figures of Israel and what he calls "fantasy-world Zionism": that Jews plot together, seek to conquer the world, and are imperialistic and bloodthirsty, which gave rise to the reactivation of stories about ritual murder and the poisoning of food and water supplies. The Israeli victory of 1967, the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, and the Palestinian deaths during the [[first Intifada]] all served to reinforce the caricature. &lt;ref name=Taguieff&gt;[[Pierre André Taguieff|Taguieff, Pierre André]]. ''Rising from the Muck: The New Anti-Semitism in Europe''. Ivan R. Dee, 2004, p. 62. &lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Forster and Epstein, officials of the [[Anti-Defamation League]], published ''The New anti-Semitism'', which appears to be the first book-length treatment of the subject. They expressed concern about manifestations of antisemitism and opposition to Israel, drawing attention to what they called "Arab propaganda" and "the oil weapon" in international affairs. &lt;ref name=Forster165&gt;Forster, Arnold &amp; Epstein, Benjamin, ''The New Anti-Semitism''. McGraw-Hill 1974, p.165.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of their criticism is directed towards left-wing American organizations of the period, such as the [[Young Socialist Alliance]], [[Students for a Democratic Society]], and the [[International Communist League (Fourth Internationalist)|Spartacist League]]. &lt;ref name=Forster9&gt;Forster, Arnold &amp; Epstein, Benjamin, ''The New Anti-Semitism''. McGraw-Hill 1974, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, radical left-wing movements voiced increasing opposition to Israel, controversially claiming that Zionism was a racist and [[Colonialism|colonialist]] movement. In 1984, historian [[Robert Wistrich]] delivered a lecture in the home of [[Chaim Herzog]], the [[President of Israel]], in which he spoke of a "new anti-Semitic anti-Zionism," the characteristic mode of which was the equation of Zionism with [[Nazism]]. He stated that "in recent years these grotesque Soviet blood-libels have been taken up by a part of the radical Left &amp;mdash; especially the [[Trotskyist]]s &amp;mdash; in Western Europe and America". &lt;ref name=Wistrich1984&gt;[[Robert S. Wistrich|Wistrich, Robert]]. [http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/Antizionism.htm "Anti-zionism as an Expression of Anti-Semitism in Recent Years"], lecture delivered to the Study Circle on World Jewry in the home of the [[President of Israel]], December 10, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1980s, the Israeli foreign minister [[Abba Eban]] argued that "the New Left is the author and progenitor of the new anti-Semitism."&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Daniel. (ed.) ''Anti-Semitism and Zionism: Selected Marxist Writings''. International Publishers, 1987, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators stated that the tendency to criticize Israel actions more vehemently than those of other nations was a form of antisemitic prejudice. Monsignor [[John M. Oesterreicher]] said in 1983: "Nobody says anything against the Egyptian authorities for oppressing the Coptic Christians. No one protested vehemently against the forced closing of St. Joseph's College years ago in Iraq, nor against the laws in Jordan prior to 1967 which prohibited Christians from acquiring new property. If Israel did any of these things, everyone would cry bloody murder... This is prejudice." &lt;ref&gt;James C. O'Neill, [http://christianactionforisrael.org/action/lovewill.html "God's 'Loving Will' Spurs Church's 'Jewish Connection,"] ''Our Sunday Visitor'', July 10, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chip Berlet]] of [[Political Research Associates]], an American research group that tracks the far right, writes that, during the early 1980s, isolationists on the far right made overtures to anti-war activists on the left to join forces against government policies in areas where they shared concerns,&lt;ref name=berletzog&gt;[[Chip Berlet|Berlet, Chip]]. [http://www.newint.org/issue372/zog.htm "ZOG Ate My Brains"], ''New Internationalist'', October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; mainly civil liberties, opposition to U.S. military intervention overseas, and opposition to U.S. support for Israel.&lt;ref name=berletwoos&gt;Berlet, Chip. [http://www.publiceye.org/rightwoo/rwooz9-01.html "Right woos Left"], ''Publiceye.org'', December 20, 1990; revised February 22, 1994, revised again 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Berlet reports that the right-wing use of [[anti-Zionism]] as a cover for anti-Semitism can be seen in a 1981 issue of ''Spotlight'', published by the neo-Nazi [[Liberty Lobby]]: "A brazen attempt by influential "Israel-firsters" in the policy echelons of the Reagan administration to extend their control to the day-to-day espionage and covert-action operations of the CIA was the hidden source of the controversy and scandals that shook the U.S. intelligence establishment this summer. The dual loyalists ... have long wanted to grab a hand in the on-the-spot "field control" of the CIA's worldwide clandestine services. They want this control, not just for themselves, but on behalf of the [[Mossad]], Israel's terrorist secret police. (''Spotlight, August 24, 1981, cited in Berlet, Chip. [http://www.publiceye.org/rightwoo/rwooz9-01.html "Right woos Left"], ''Publiceye.org'', December 20, 1990; revised February 22, 1994, revised again 1999.)&lt;/ref&gt;

As they interacted, some of the classic right-wing anti-Semitic [[Scapegoat|scapegoating]] conspiracy theories began to seep into progressive circles, &lt;ref name=berletwoos/&gt; including stories about how a "[[New World Order (conspiracy)|New World Order]]", also called the "Shadow Government" or "The Octopus," &lt;ref name=berletzog/&gt; was manipulating world governments. Berlet writes that antisemitic conspiracism &lt;ref&gt;Berlet does not himself use the expression "new antisemitism"; nor does he comment on whether he believes the current wave of antisemitism should be regarded as a new phenomenon or not.&lt;/ref&gt; was "peddled aggressively" by right-wing groups, and that the left adopted the rhetoric, which Berlet argues was made possible by the left's lack of knowledge of the history of [[fascism]] and its use of "scapegoating, [[Reductionism|reductionist]] and simplistic solutions, [[Demagogy|demagoguery]], and a conspiracy theory of history." &lt;ref name=berletwoos/&gt;

Toward the end of 1990, as the movement against the [[Gulf War]] began to build, Berlet writes that a number of far-right and antisemitic groups sought out alliances with left-wing anti-war coalitions, who began to speak openly about a "Jewish lobby" that was encouraging the United States to invade the Middle East. This idea morphed into conspiracy theories about a "[[Zionist Occupation Government|Zionist-occupied government]]" (ZOG),  which Berlet writes is the modern incarnation of the antisemitic hoax, ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''. &lt;ref name=berletzog/&gt; Berlet adds: "It is important to recognize that as a whole the antiwar movement overwhelmingly rejected these overtures by the political right, while recognizing that the attempt reflected a larger ongoing problem." He cites the example of [[Wisconsin]] anti-war activist Alan Ruff, who appeared on a panel in [[Verona]] to discuss the Gulf War. Also on the panel on the anti-war side was another local activist, Emmanuel Branch. "Suddenly I heard Branch saying the war was the result of a Zionist banking conspiracy," said Ruff. "I found myself squeezed between pro-war hawks and this anti-Jewish nut, it destroyed the ability of those of us who opposed the war to make our point." &lt;ref name=berletwoos/&gt;

==Arguments for and against the concept==
===A new phenomenon===
[[Jack Fischel]], chair of history at [[Millersville University of Pennsylvania]], writes that the new anti-Semitism is a new phenomenon stemming from what he calls an "unprecedented coalition" of enemies: "leftists, vociferously opposed to the policies of Israel, and right-wing antisemites, committed to the destruction of Israel, [who] were joined by millions of [[Muslim]]s, including [[Arabs]], who immigrated to Europe ... and who brought with them their hatred of Israel in particular and of Jews in general." It is this new political alignment, he argues, that makes new antisemitism unique. &lt;ref name=Fischel&gt;Fischel, Jack R. [http://www.vqronline.org/articles/2005/summer/fischel-new-anti-semitism/ "The New Anti-Semitism"], ''The Virginia Quarterly Review'', Summer 2005, pp. 225-234.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Strauss]] of ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' links it to [[anti-globalism]], describing it as "the medieval image of the 'Christ-killing' Jew resurrected on the editorial pages of cosmopolitan European newspapers. It is the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] refusing to put the [[Star of David]] on their ambulances ... It is [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]] donning checkered Palestinian [[kaffiyeh]]s and Palestinians lining up to buy copies of ''[[Mein Kampf]]''." &lt;ref name=strauss272&gt;Strauss, Mark.

The French philosopher [[Pierre-André Taguieff]] argues that ''Judenhass'' based on [[racism]] and [[nationalism]] has been replaced by a new form based on anti-racism and anti-nationalism. He identifies some of its main features as the use of anti-racism for anti-Jewish purposes, identifying Zionism as racism; the use of material related to [[Holocaust denial]] becomes an ordinary feature of discourse e.g. doubts about the number of victims, allegations of a Holocaust industry; discourse is borrowed from [[third worldism]], [[anti-imperialism]], [[anti-colonialism]], [[anti-Americanism]], and [[anti-globalization]]; there is widespread dissemination of what he calls the "myth" of the "intrinsically good Palestinian &amp;mdash; the innocent victim ''par excellence''. &lt;ref name=Taguieff67&gt;[[Pierre-André Taguieff|Taguieff, Pierre-André]]. ''Rising from the Muck: The New Anti-Semitism in Europe''. Ivan R. Dee, 2004, p. 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

In part because the concept of new antisemitism is a recent one, and because of the nature of it, there are no indices of measurement, according to [[Irwin Cotler]], Professor of Law at [[McGill University]], and Canada's former [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Justice Minister]]. &lt;ref name=Cotler&gt;[[Irwin Cotler|Cotler, Irwin]]. [http://frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=12191 "Human Rights and the New Anti-Jewishness"], ''FrontPageMagazine.com'', [[February 16]], [[2004]].&lt;/ref&gt; Cotler defines classical antisemitism as "the [[discrimination]] against, or denial of, the right of Jews to live as equal members of a free society," the focus of which is discrimination against Jews as individuals. He argues that the new antisemitism, by contrast, "involves the discrimination against the right of the Jewish people to live as an equal member of the family of nations"; that is, discrimination against Jews as a people. He argues that antisemitism has expanded from hatred of Jews (classical antisemitism) to hatred of Jewish national aspirations (new antisemitism). &lt;ref name=Cotler/&gt; The latter is hard to measure because the usual indices used by governments to detect discrimination &amp;mdash; standard of living, housing, health, and employment &amp;mdash; are useful only in measuring discrimination against individuals. Because it is difficult to measure, it is difficult to show convincingly that the concept is a valid one.

===A new phenomenon, but not antisemitism===
[[Image:BrianKlug.jpg|right|thumb|160px|Dr. [[Brian Klug]] argues that the new prejudice is not antisemitism, new or old; not a mutation of an existing virus, but "a brand new 'bug'." &lt;ref name=KlugCatalyst&gt;[[Brian Klug|Klug, Brian]]. [http://www.catalystmagazine.org.uk/Default.aspx.LocID-0hgnew0bv.RefLocID-0hg01b00100600f009.Lang-EN.htm "In search of clarity"], [[Catalyst Magazine|''Catalyst'']], March 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
That there has been a resurgence of antisemitic attacks and attitudes is accepted by most opponents of the concept of new antisemitism. &lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Finkelstein]] argues that there has been no significant rise in antisemitism: "What does the evidence show? There has been good investigation done, serious investigation. All the evidence shows there's no &amp;mdash; there's no evidence at all for a rise of a new anti-Semitism, whether in Europe or in North America. The evidence is zero. And, in fact, there's a new book put out by an Israel stalwart. His name is Walter Laqueur, a very prominent scholar. It's called ''The Changing Face of Anti-Semitism''. It just came out, 2006, from [[Oxford University Press]]. He looks at the evidence, and he says no. There's some in Europe among the Muslim community, there's some anti-Semitism, but the notion that in the heart of European society or North American society there's anti-Semitism is preposterous. And in fact &amp;mdash; or no, a significant rise in anti-Semitism is preposterous."
([http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=11&amp;ar=479  "Finkelstein on DN! -- No New Antisemitism"], Interview of Norman Finkelstein by Amy Goodman, August 29, 2006.)

In his another 2006 book, Laqueur writes: "... behind the cover of "anti-Zionism" lurks a variety of motives that ought to be called by their true name. When, in the 1950s under Stalin, the Jews of the Soviet Union came under severe attack and scores were executed, it was under the banner of anti-Zionism rather than anti-Semitism, which had been given a bad name by Adolf Hitler. When in later years the policy of Israeli governments was attacked as racist or colonialist in various parts of the world, the basis of the criticism was quite often the belief that Israel had no right to exist in the first place, not opposition to specific policies of the Israeli government.
Traditional anti-Semitism has gone out of fashion in the West except on the extreme right. But something we might call post-anti-Semitism has taken its place. It is less violent in its aims, but still very real. By and large it has not been too difficult to differentiate between genuine and bogus anti-Zionism. The test is twofold. It is almost always clear whether the attacks are directed against a specific policy carried out by an Israeli government (for instance, as an occupying power) or against the existence of Israel. Secondly, there is the test of selectivity. If from all the evils besetting the world, the misdeeds, real or imaginary, of Zionism are singled out and given constant and relentless publicity, it can be taken for granted that the true motive is not anti-Zionism but something different and more sweeping." ([[Walter Laqueur|Laqueur, Walter]]: ''"Dying for Jerusalem: The Past, Present and Future of the Holiest City"'' (Sourcebooks, Inc., 2006) ISBN 1402206321. p. 55)&lt;/ref&gt; What is not accepted is that this constitutes a different kind of antisemitism.

[[Brian Klug]], senior research fellow in philosophy at [[St Benet's Hall, Oxford]] &amp;mdash; who gave expert testimony in February 2006 to a British parliamentary inquiry into antisemitism in the UK, and in November 2004 to the Hearing on Anti-Semitism at the German [[Bundestag]] &amp;mdash; argues against the idea that there is a "single, unified phenomenon" that could be called "new" antisemitism. He accepts that there is reason for the Jewish community to be concerned, citing the [[2003 Istanbul bombings|truck-bombing of two synagogues in Istanbul]], an arson attack on an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] school in Paris, the reappearance of anti-Semitic slogans during demonstrations opposing the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], and the increase in [[9/11 conspiracy theories#Claims related to Jews and Israel|conspiracy theories involving Jews]]. He writes that some researchers report a 60 percent increase worldwide of assaults on Jews in 2002 compared to the previous year. &lt;ref name=Klug1&gt;[[Brian Klug|Klug, Brian]]. [http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20040202&amp;s=klug The Myth of the New Anti-Semitism]. ''[[The Nation]]'', February 2, 2004, accessed January 9, 2006, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Klug argues that the antisemitism involved in such incidents is not a new phenomenon but "classical" antisemitism, and that "it is closer to the truth to say that anti-Zionism today takes the form of anti-Semitism rather than the other way round." Proponents of the new antisemitism concept, he writes, see an "organizing principle" that allows them to formulate a new concept, but it is only in terms of this concept that many of the examples cited in evidence of it count as examples in the first place. &lt;ref name=Klug1/&gt; That is, the creation of the concept may be based on a circular argument or [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]]. He argues that it is an unhelpful concept, because it devalues the term "anti-Semitism," leading to widespread cynicism about the use of it, which undermines the credibility of those who fight it. People of goodwill who support the Palestinians resent being falsely accused of being anti-Semites. &lt;ref name=KlugCatalyst&gt;[[Brian Klug|Klug, Brian]]. [http://www.catalystmagazine.org.uk/Default.aspx.LocID-0hgnew0bv.RefLocID-0hg01b00100600f009.Lang-EN.htm "In search of clarity"], [[Catalyst Magazine|''Catalyst'']], March 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Klug defines classical antisemitism as "an ingrained European fantasy about Jews as Jews," arguing that whether Jews are seen as a [[race]], [[religion]], or [[ethnicity]], and whether antisemitism comes from the right or the left, the antisemite's image of the Jew is always as "a people set apart, not merely by their customs but by their collective character. They are arrogant, secretive, cunning, always looking to turn a profit. Loyal only to their own, wherever they go they form a state within a state, preying upon the societies in whose midst they dwell. Mysteriously powerful, their hidden hand controls the banks and the media. They will even drag governments into war if this suits their purposes. Such is the figure of 'the Jew,' transmitted from generation to generation." &lt;ref name=KlugRedPepper&gt;[[Brian Klug|Klug, Brian]]. [http://www.jfjfp.org/BackgroundJ/klug_redpepper_2006.htm Israel, Antisemitism and the left], ''Red Pepper'', November 24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

He argues that, although it is true that the new antisemitism incorporates the idea that anti-Semitism is hostility to Jews as Jews, the source of the hostility has changed; therefore, to continue using the same expression for it &amp;mdash; antisemitism &amp;mdash; causes confusion. Today's hostility to Jews as Jews is based on the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]], not on ancient European fantasies. Israel proclaims itself as the state of the Jewish people, and many Jews align themselves with Israel for that very reason. It is out of this alignment that the hostility to Jews as Jews arises, rather than hostility to Israelis or to Zionists. Klug agrees that it is a prejudice, because it is a generalization about individuals; nevertheless, he argues, it is "not rooted in the ideology of 'the Jew'," and is therefore a different phenomenon from antisemitism. &lt;ref name=KlugCatalyst/&gt;

The problem with calling this new prejudice "new antisemitism" is that it gives the impression of an ideological continuum from religious to racial to "new" antisemitism. Klug writes that religious antisemitism mutated into racial antisemitism, and that the latter was clearly a variation on a pre-existing theme. Not so with the new phenomenon, he argues, which has entirely different origins and content. It is not a mutation of an existing virus, but "a brand new 'bug'." &lt;ref name=KlugCatalyst/&gt;

That is, Klug argues that there are three distinct components of what some scholars are calling "new antisemitism":

*Antisemitism, a prejudice that is based on the stereotypical construction of 'the Jew';
*[[Anti-Zionism]] and antagonism to Israel, based on a political cause or moral code, and not anti-Jewish ''per se'';
*Prejudice against all Jews that is derived from the latter. &lt;ref name=KlugCatalyst/&gt;

{{rquote|right|'''''People of goodwill who support the Palestinians resent being falsely accused of being anti-Semites.''''' &amp;mdash; [[Brian Klug]] &lt;ref name=KlugCatalyst/&gt;}}
The discourse of the new antisemitism conflates these, he argues, leading not only to the branding as anti-Semitic of legitimate political views about Israel, but to inflated estimates of the scale of antisemitic incidents. The line between "fair and foul" criticism of Israel tends to be drawn in such a way that it rules out criticism "that goes much beyond a gentle rap across the [Israeli] government's knuckles or finger-wagging at the laws of the land." If most anti-Zionist arguments do cross the line, and if crossing the line is antisemitic, it follows that most attacks on Israel are antisemitic, as is any attack on a Jewish target that is inspired by the line that has been crossed. This is compelling logic, writes Klug, but the effect of it is "to produce, at a stroke, a quantum leap in the amount of antisemitism worldwide, if not a veritable 'war against the Jews'," given how much controversy Israel currently inspires. &lt;ref name=Klug2&gt;Klug, Brian. [http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20040202&amp;s=klug The Myth of the New Anti-Semitism]. ''The Nation'', February 2, 2004, accessed January 9, 2006, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that crossing the line from fair to foul is
a normal part of political debate. Pro-Israelis aren't necessarily racists when they do it; pro-Palestinians are not necessarily anti-Semites when they do. Jumping to conclusions about people's prejudices is itself a form of prejudice. &lt;ref name=KlugCatalyst/&gt;

Klug writes that contemporary antisemitism can be identified by looking for the use of the antisemitic figure of 'the Jew'. Whenever a text or image projects this figure (a) onto Israel because Israel is a Jewish state; (b) onto Zionism because Zionism is a Jewish movement; or (c) onto Jews as individuals or a group in association with Israel or Zionism, then it is antisemitic. &lt;ref name=KlugCatalyst/&gt;

====The Klug/Wistrich correspondence====
In correspondence with Klug, [[Robert S. Wistrich|Robert Wistrich]], Neuburger Professor of European and Jewish history at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and director of its International Center for the Study of Antisemitism &amp;mdash; who also testified in February 2006 to the British parliamentary inquiry &amp;mdash; responds that his own [[litmus test]] of when criticism of Israel becomes antisemitism is when the critic wishes to dismantle the [[Jewish state]] without calling for the dismantling of other states; [[Demonization|demonizes]] Israel; brands it "Nazi" or "racist"; or relies on classic antisemitic stereotypes: for example, the "Jewish Lobby." He notes that Britain's Association of University Teachers voted to boycott Israeli universities, but not Russian academics for the Chechen atrocities, China for its occupation of Tibet, Saudi Arabian universities for "[[gender apartheid]]," or Palestinian universities for "glorifying [[jihad]]i terrorism." These decisions are "inexplicable without taking anti-Semitism into account," he writes. Wistrich also takes issue with the notion that Israelis are European interlopers in the Middle East; they are an "[[Indigenous people|aboriginal]] people returning to their historic homeland and source of national identity." He argues that half the Israeli population is not European anyway, but was "uprooted from the Arab Middle East by exclusivist pan-Arabism, Islamic fanaticism, and the pressures of decolonization." &lt;ref name=Klug/Wistrich&gt;[[Brian Klug|Klug, Brian]] &amp; [[Robert S. Wistrich|Wistrich, Robert S.]] [http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/klug.html "Correspondence between Prof. Robert Wistrich and Brian Klug: When Is Opposition to Israel and Its Policies Anti-Semitic?"], International Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, retrieved September 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[S]ixty years ago, there were more than a million Jews in Arab lands. Their exodus says it all. Israel integrated them, providing a haven, pride, dignity and freedom as it did for the Jewish survivors of [[the Holocaust]]. Palestinian refugees, on the other hand, were left to rot in UN [[refugee camp]]s by their Arab brethren, fed with [[Revanchism|revanchist]] delusions about their inalienable "[[right of return]]" to Israel. If the Middle East tragedy is to be resolved, it is these camps – the seedbed of [[terrorism]] and an entire culture of hatred – which have to be dismantled and not the thriving Jewish state. &lt;ref name=Klug/Wistrich/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Klug agrees that it is "simplistic" to regard Israel as an interloper in the Middle East, but that nevertheless it is how the Jewish state has "looked through Arab eyes." The view that Jews are "an aboriginal people returning to their historic homeland" is equally one-sided, he argues, and is just one version of the Zionist point of view. Both sides must grasp what he calls this "clash of perspectives" and stop relying on one-sided accounts. Klug sums up his own view of when criticism of Israel becomes antisemitism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Seen through the eyes of an anti-semite, Jews are essentially alien, powerful, cohesive, cunning, parasitic, and so on. Opposition to Israel or its government is anti-Semitic when it employs some variation or other of this fantasy – just as criticism of Arabs is racist when it is based on the stock figure of the Arab as cunning, lying and degenerate, or as a hateful terrorist who attaches no value to human life. &lt;ref name=Klug/Wistrich/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wistrich argues there is a "continuum of prejudice" against Jews that can lead from social discrimination to [[ghetto]]ization and worse, and that Klug "radically underestimates" the effects of the liberal-left delegitimization of Zionism. "What we have seen in recent years is indeed a new form of anti-Semitism operating under a humanist façade which (falsely) pillories Israel and Jews as being inherently 'racist'." Wistrich writes that anti-Semitism is now driven by "[[Islamism|Islamists]] who set the tone" by demonizing America, Israel, and the Jews, while "the media, the academic, artistic, religious and political elites in the [[European Union]] meekly follow suit." &lt;ref name=Klug/Wistrich/&gt;

Klug agrees that the "continuum of prejudice" exists, but argues that it is part of European history, not Middle Eastern; and that Zionism was the response to it, the empowerment of the powerless. He writes that the Zionist movement succeeded, and Israel is now a major power. For that very reason, he argues, when people object to the way it exercises its power, it should not be regarded as antisemitism. &lt;ref name=Klug/Wistrich/&gt;

===Criticism of Israel is not necessarily antisemitism===
Earl Raab, founding director of the Nathan Perlmutter Institute for Jewish Advocacy at [[Brandeis University]] writes that "[t]here is a new surge of antisemitism in the world, and much prejudice against Israel is driven by such antisemitism," but argues that "charges of antisemitism based on anti-Israel remarks alone have proven to lack credibility in most circles".  He adds that "a grave educational misdirection is imbedded in formulations suggesting that if we somehow get rid of antisemitism, we will get rid of anti-Israelism. This reduces the problems of prejudice against Israel to cartoon proportions."  Raab describes prejudice against Israel as a "serious breach of morality and good sense," and argues that it is often a bridge to antisemitism, but distinguishes it from antisemitism as such. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0411/is_4_51/ai_106730943 Earl Raab, "Antisemitism, anti-Israelism, anti-Americanism"], ''Judaism'', Fall 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Zipperstein, professor of Jewish Culture and History at [[Stanford University]], argues that a belief in the [[State of Israel]]'s responsibility for the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]] is considered "part of what a reasonably informed, progressive, decent person thinks," &lt;ref name=zipperstein53&gt;Zipperstein, Steven. "Historical Reflections of Contemporary Antisemitism" in ''Contemporary Antisemitism: Canada and the World'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; and a disproportionate criticism of Israel is not the result of new anti-Semitism, or even classical anti-Semitism, but is simply a "by-product of the wildly disproportionate responses that mark the post-September 11 world." &lt;ref name=zipperstein60&gt;Zipperstein, Steven. "Historical Reflections of Contemporary Antisemitism" in ''Contemporary Antisemitism: Canada and the World'', p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Zipperstein writes that "anti-Israelism" is shaped by "a much distorted, simplistic, but this-worldly political analysis devoid of anti-Jewish bias." &lt;ref name=zipperstein61/&gt;
{{rquote|right|'''''[Jews] are prone to see a Jewish state as ... more vulnerable, less powerful, less culpable, as victim and not as an actor, at least partly because &amp;mdash; so very recently in our own history &amp;mdash; we were the quintessential victims.''''' &amp;mdash; Steven Zipperstein &lt;ref name=zipperstein61&gt;Zipperstein, Steven.

Penslar et al, ed., ''Contemporary Antisemitism: Canada and the World'', Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2005, pp. 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He argues that Jews have a tendency to see the [[State of Israel]] as "more vulnerable, less powerful, and less culpable, as victim and not as an actor" because they were very recently themselves "the quintessential victims." &lt;ref name=zipperstein61/&gt; He writes that: "We were mostly undefended and overwhelmingly friendless, and this trauma continues to haunt and perhaps at times to distort our sense of the world around us now. When we encounter antagonism &amp;mdash; especially outsized, disproportionate antagonism &amp;mdash; the memories of horrible times, whether personally experienced or imbibed secondhand, elicit reactions that are often sincere, acute, and disorienting." &lt;ref name=zipperstein62&gt;Zipperstein, Steven. "Historical Reflections of Contemporary Antisemitism" in ''Contemporary Antisemitism: Canada and the World'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The third wave===
[[Image:Lewis-pre.jpg|left|thumb|Professor [[Bernard Lewis]] argues that the new anti-Semitism &amp;mdash; what he calls "ideological anti-Semitism" &amp;mdash; has mutated out of religious and racial anti-Semitism.]]
[[Bernard Lewis]], Cleveland E. Dodge Professor Emeritus of Near Eastern Studies at [[Princeton University]], argues that the new antisemitism represents a "third wave" of antisemitism. He defines the first wave as [[Anti-Judaism|religious antisemitism]], the second as racial, and the third as ideological. &lt;ref name=LewisBrandeis1&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]]. [http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/21832.html "The New Anti-Semitism"], ''The American Scholar'', Volume 75 No. 1, Winter 2006, pp. 25-36. The paper is based on a lecture delivered at [[Brandeis University]] on [[March 24]], [[2004]].&lt;/ref&gt;

For Lewis, antisemitism is marked by two distinct features: Jews are judged according to a standard different from that applied to others, and they are accused of "cosmic evil." Criticism of the state of Israel or Zionism, he writes, is not necessarily motivated by antisemitism. Even further, "it is perfectly possible to hate and even to persecute Jews without necessarily being anti-Semitic". &lt;ref name=LewisBrandeis1/&gt;

He writes that what he calls the first wave of antisemitism arose with the advent of [[Christianity]] because of the Jews' rejection of [[Jesus]] as [[Messiah]]. The second wave, racial anti-Semitism, emerged in Spain when large numbers of Jews were forcibly [[Religious conversion|converted]], and doubts about the sincerity of the converts led to ideas about the importance of "''la limpieza de sangre''", purity of blood. &lt;ref name=LewisBrandeis&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]]. [http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/21832.html "The New Anti-Semitism"], ''The American Scholar'', Volume 75 No. 1, Winter 2006, pp. 25-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis associates the third wave with the [[Arab]]s, and writes that it arose only in part because of the establishment of the [[State of Israel]]. Until the 19th century, [[Muslim]]s had regarded Jews with what Lewis calls "amused, tolerant superiority" &amp;mdash; they were seen as physically weak, cowardly, and unmilitary &amp;mdash; and although Jews living in Muslim countries were not treated as equals, they were shown a certain amount of respect. The Western form of anti-Semitism &amp;mdash; what Lewis calls "the cosmic, [[Satan|satanic]] version of Jew hatred" &amp;mdash; arrived in the Middle East in several stages, beginning with [[Mission (Christian)|Christian missionaries]] in the 19th century, and continued to grow slowly into the 20th century, up to the establishment of the [[Third Reich]]. He writes that it increased because of the humiliation of the Israeli military victories of 1948 and 1967. ''(See [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] and [[Six Day War]].)'' &lt;ref name=LewisBrandeis/&gt;

Into this mix entered the [[United Nations]]. Lewis argues that the United Nations' handling of the 1948 refugee situation convinced the Arab world that discrimination against Jews was acceptable. When the ancient Jewish community in [[East Jerusalem]] was evicted and its monuments desecrated or destroyed, they were offered no help. Similarly, when Jewish refugees fled or were driven out of Arab countries, no help was offered, but elaborate arrangements were made for Arabs who fled or were driven out of the area that became Israel. All the Arab governments involved in the conflict announced that they would not admit Israelis of any religion into their territories, but the United Nations did not protest; and furthermore announced that they would not give visas to Jews, no matter which country they were citizens of. Again, the United Nations did not protest. All of this has sent what Lewis calls a "clear message" to the Arab world. Lewis writes that this third wave of antisemitism has in common with the first wave that Jews are able to be part of it. With religious antisemitism, Jews were able to distance themselves from Judaism and convert, and Lewis writes that some even reached high rank within the church and the [[Inquisition]]. With racial antisemitism, this was not possible, but with the new, ideological antisemitism, Jews are once again able to join the critics. The new antisemitism also allows non-Jews, he argues, to criticize or attack Jews without feeling overshadowed by the crimes of the Nazis. &lt;ref name=LewisBrandeis/&gt;

===The fourth wave since 1945===
[[Image:Yehuda Bauer.jpg|right|frame|Professor [[Yehuda Bauer]] writes that the new anti-Semitism is the fourth wave of anti-Semitism to spread across the West since 1945.]]

[[Yehuda Bauer]], Professor of Holocaust Studies at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], writes that there have been three waves of anti-Semitism since 1945 &amp;mdash; 1958-60; 1968-1972; and 1987-1992 &amp;mdash; and that we are now experiencing the fourth, which he estimates started in 1999 or 2000. &lt;ref name=Bauer2&gt;Bauer, Yehuda. {{PDFlink|[http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf "Problems of Contemporary Anti-Semitism"]}}, 2003, p 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Each wave has had different causes, some of them to do with economic downturns. The common ground, however, has been "an underlying latency of anti-Semitism that waits to explode when aroused by some outside crisis." &lt;ref name=Bauer4&gt;Bauer, Yehuda. [http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf "Problems of Contemporary Anti-Semitism"] (pdf), 2003, p 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes the fourth wave as an upper-middle class, intellectual phenomenon, "widespread in the media, in universities, and in well-manicured circles.

Bauer notes that the two crises that led to the post-1945 waves of antisemitism are the [[Holocaust]] and the establishment of the [[State of Israel]]. The Holocaust created an unease about Jews, he writes, especially in Europe, where people "have to live with six million ghosts, created by a deadly mutation of European culture." &lt;ref name=Bauer4/&gt; Although a feeling of relief accompanied the creation of Israel, because Europeans no longer had to deal with the Jews, at the same time, he argues, it turned the Jews from victims into perpetrators. He argues that the Arab-Israeli conflict "provide[s] ample material for an antisemitism that sees itself as anti-Zionist." Anti-Zionism need not be antisemitic, "but only if one says that all national movements are evil, and all national states should be abolished. But if one says that the [[Fijian people|Fijians]] have the right to independence, and so do the [[Malay people|Malays]] or the [[Bolivia]]ns, but the Jews have no such right, then one is anti-Jewish, and as one singles out the Jews for nationalistic reasons, one is anti-Semitic, with an attendant strong suspicion of being racist." Citing [[Irwin Cotler]], Bauer writes that "the status of the collective Jew, that is Israel, is akin to the status of the individual Jew in the [[Middle Ages]]." &lt;ref name=Bauer5&gt;Bauer, Yehuda. {{PDFlink|[http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf "Problems of Contemporary Anti-Semitism"]}}, 2003, p 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Arab-Israeli conflict has produced real tragedy for Palestinians, Bauer suggests that Western latent antisemitism has fastened onto that tragedy in order to brand the Jews as mass murderers and Nazis as a way of solving the West's own psychological problems caused by the Holocaust. "Facts do not matter there," he writes, arguing that the number of Palestinians killed between the beginning of the [[Second Intifada]] in 2000 and 2003 (when he was writing) was around 2,000, which is one sixth of the daily number of Jews shipped to [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Auschwitz from Hungary]] in the spring of 1944. Bearing these figures in mind, "[a]ny kind of simplistic comparison becomes totally ridiculous," he argues. &lt;ref name=Bauer6&gt;Bauer, Yehuda. [http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf "Problems of Contemporary Anti-Semitism"] (pdf), 2003, p 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{rquote|right|'''''A charming TV personality [on Egyptian television] asked little Basmallah, a 3½ year old girl, 'Do you know who the Jews are?' "Yes." 'Do you like them?' "No." 'Why?' "Because they are monkeys and swine ..."''''' &lt;br&gt;&amp;mdash; [[Yehuda Bauer]] &lt;ref name=Bauer8&gt;Bauer, Yehuda. [http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf "Problems of Contemporary Anti-Semitism"] (pdf), 2003, p 8.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bauer regards this wave of antisemitism as dangerous because of [[Islamism]]. He identifies Islamism as one of three major ideologies to have emerged during the 20th century, alongside Soviet [[Communism]] and [[National Socialism]], &lt;ref name=Bauer13&gt;Bauer, Yehuda. [http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf "Problems of Contemporary Anti-Semitism"] (pdf), 2003, p 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and argues that all three saw or see the Jews as a main enemy. &lt;ref name=Bauer14&gt;Bauer, Yehuda. {{PDFlink|[http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf "Problems of Contemporary Anti-Semitism"]}}, 2003, p 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The language used about Jews by the Muslim media is, he says, "clearly and unmistakably genocidal," the ideology of [[Nazism]] "in a different dress."&lt;ref name=Bauer15&gt;Bauer, Yehuda. [http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf "Problems of Contemporary Anti-Semitism"] (pdf), 2003, p 15.&lt;/ref&gt; He cites a television program broadcast on [[May 2]], [[2002]] on the [[Egypt]]ian television station IQRAA, during which a three-year-old girl was asked whether she knew who the Jews were and whether she liked them. She replied that she did not like them, because "they are monkeys and swine ... and also because they tried to poison the wife of our [[Muhammad|prophet]]." &lt;ref name=Bauer8/&gt; Bauer writes that 1.2 billion Muslims are being exposed to these teachings, making this fourth wave of antisemitism a "genocidal threat to the Jewish people." &lt;ref name=Bauer17&gt;Bauer, Yehuda. [http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf "Problems of Contemporary Anti-Semitism"] (pdf), 2003, p 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===A contradictory political ploy===
[[Image:Norman Finkelstein.jpg|right|thumb|170px|Dr. [[Norman Finkelstein]] argues that the charge  of "new anti-Semitism" has been made to "immunize Israel from legitimate criticism". &lt;ref name=Finkelstein45&gt;[[Norman Finkelstein|Finkelstein, Norman]]. ''Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History'', University of California Press, 2005, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Norman Finkelstein]], a political scientist at [[DePaul University]], has criticized the concept of new antisemitism. He argues that organizations such as the [[Anti-Defamation League]] have brought forward charges of "new antisemitism" at varied intervals since the 1970s, "not to fight antisemitism but rather to exploit the historical suffering of Jews in order to immunize Israel against criticism". &lt;ref name=Finkelstein21&gt;[[Norman Finkelstein|Finkelstein, Norman]]. ''Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History'', University of California Press, 2005, pp. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; He has criticized much of the recent literature on the subject, including works by [[Phyllis Chesler]], [[Gabriel Schoenfeld]] and [[Ron Rosenbaum]]. &lt;ref name=Finkelstein34&gt;[[Norman Finkelstein|Finkelstein, Norman]]. ''Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History'', University of California Press, 2005, pp. 34, 38-39 [Chesler], 39-40 [Schoenfield], 41-45].&lt;/ref&gt;  

Finkelstein writes that what's currently called the new anti-Semitism consists of three components: (i) "exaggeration and fabrication", (ii) "mislabeling legitimate criticism of Israeli policy," and (iii) "the unjustified yet predictable spillover from criticism of Israel to Jews generally". &lt;ref name=Finkelstein66&gt;[[Norman Finkelstein|Finkelstein, Norman]]. ''Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History'', University of California Press, 2005, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Finkelstein argues that most evidence purporting to show a new anti-Semitism has been taken from "organizations directly or indirectly linked to Israel or having a material stake in inflating the findings of anti-Semitism" and that some anti-Semitic incidents reported in recent years either did not occur or were misidentified. &lt;ref name=Finkelstein66/68&gt;[[Norman Finkelstein|Finkelstein, Norman]]. ''Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History'', University of California Press, 2005, p. 66, 68-71.&lt;/ref&gt; He draws attention to the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia's 2003 report on antisemitism, which included displays of the [[Palestinian flag]], support for the [[PLO]], and [[allegations of Israeli apartheid]] in its list of antisemitic activities and beliefs. &lt;ref name=Finkelstein37&gt;[[Norman Finkelstein|Finkelstein, Norman]]. ''Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History'', University of California Press, 2005, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finkelstein argues that much recent hostility toward Israel and its "vocal Jewish supporters abroad" has been misinterpreted as resulting from "an irrational, inexplicable, and ineluctable" hatred of Jews, rather than from opposition to Israel's actions against the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]]. He writes that "Israel's apologists" have denied a causal relationship between Israeli policies and hostility toward Jews, since "if Israeli policies, and widespread Jewish support for them, evoke hostility toward Jews, it means that Israel and its Jewish supporters might themselves be causing anti-Semitism; and it might be doing so because Israel and its Jewish supporters are ''in the wrong''". &lt;ref name=Finkelstein78&gt;[[Norman Finkelstein|Finkelstein, Norman]]. ''Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History'', University of California Press, 2005, pp. 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt; Finkelstein notes that Jewish figures such as [[George Soros]] and [[Avraham Burg]], who have argued that such a causal relationship exists, have been criticized by groups such as the ADL and the [[World Jewish Congress]]. &lt;ref name=Finkelstein78/&gt;
{{rquote|right|'''[I]f Israeli policies, and widespread Jewish support for them, evoke hostility toward Jews, it means that Israel and its Jewish supporters might themselves be causing anti-Semitism; and it might be doing so because Israel and its Jewish supporters are ''in the wrong''.''' &amp;mdash; [[Norman Finkelstein]]. &lt;ref name=Finkelstein78/&gt;}}

Finkelstein acknowledges that "[i]n some quarters anger at Israel's brutal occupation has undoubtedly slipped over to an animus against Jews generally", a phenomenon that he describes as "lamentable" but "hardly cause for wonder." &lt;ref name=Finkelstein81&gt;[[Norman Finkelstein|Finkelstein, Norman]]. ''Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History'', University of California Press, 2005, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The wars in Vietnam and Iraq contributed to [[anti-Americanism]], and the aggression of [[Nazi Germany]] gave rise to anti-[[Teutonic]] sentiment. Why does it surprise us, he asks, that an occupation by a self-declared Jewish state should cause antipathy towards Jews?  The only surprise, he argues, is that the antipathy does not run deeper, given that mainstream Jewish organizations offer uncritical support to Israel, that Israel defines itself juridically as the sovereign state of the Jewish people, and that Jews themselves sometimes argue that to distinguish between Israel and world Jewry is itself an example of antisemitism.&lt;ref name=Finkelstein81/2&gt;[[Norman Finkelstein|Finkelstein, Norman]]. ''Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History'', University of California Press, 2005, pp 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Finkelstein identifies several proponents of the concept of new antisemitism who appear to contradict themselves or each other on the issue of whether to identify Jews with Israel. [[Phyllis Chesler]] argues, on the one hand, that "anyone who does not distinguish between Jews and the Jewish state is an anti-Semite," but on the other that "Israel is our heart and soul ... we ''are'' family." &lt;ref&gt;[[Phyllis Chesler|Chesler, Phyllis]].

The September 2006 British "All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism" heard evidence from ''[[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight]]'', the [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] magazine, that: "the far right have started to use 'Zionists' as a euphemism for 'Jews,' to disguise their anti-Semitism, a phenomenon that also occurs on the left and among Islamist extremists." &lt;ref name=APP25&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://thepcaa.org/Report.pdf "Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism"]}}, September 2006, p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British National Party]]'s ''Voice of Freedom'' wrote of the war in Iraq that "Tony Blair swapped British blood for donations from a clique of filthy-rich Zionist businessmen." &lt;ref name=APP25/&gt; The [[Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK]] (MPACUK) has cited the [[Talmud]] as a "Zionist holy book," &lt;ref name=APP29&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://thepcaa.org/Report.pdf "Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism"]}}, September 2006, p.29.&lt;/ref&gt; and describes Zionism as an "octopus that now penetrates every western nation and pushes it to start world war three against Muslims," &lt;ref name=APP29/&gt; an anti-Semitic [[motif]] used by the Nazis.

The report describes a "symbiotic relationship" between Islamists and the far right,&lt;ref name=APP29/&gt; united in their hatred of Jews, Zionism, and Israel. &lt;ref name=APP30&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://thepcaa.org/Report.pdf "Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism"]}}, September 2006, p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; The inquiry saw evidence of the shared use of materials, such as the same newspaper articles appearing on the MPACUK and [[white nationalism|white nationalist]] websites. MPACUK published a photograph of George Bush standing next to the Israeli flag, adding the caption: "Some say Lobbying the Government doesn't make a difference. We humbly disagree," while the [[National Front]] used the same photograph, with the caption: "There is no Zionist conspiracy." Islamist and far right groups also share [[Holocaust denial]] literature, and the organizations' websites publish each other's authors. &lt;ref name=APP30/&gt;

[[Edward Said]], the late Palestinian-American literary theorist, warned of a "nasty, creeping wave of anti-Semitism" insinuating itself into Palestinian politics, writing that the "notion that the Jews never suffered and that the Holocaust is an obfuscatory confection ... is one that is acquiring too much, far too much, currency". &lt;ref name=said518&gt;[[Edward Said|Said, Edward]]. "A Desolation and They Called It Peace," in Rosenbaum, Ron. ''Those Who Forget the Past: The Question of Anti-Semitism''.

Michael cites as an example of the new Islamist/far right alliance the March 2001 conference in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] on "Revisionism and Zionism," organized by the Institute for Historical Review, where there was a plan to present lectures in English, French, and Arabic. The Lebanese government cancelled the conference after protests from Jewish groups and the American government, but a smaller meeting was held in May 2001 in [[Amman]], [[Jordan]]. &lt;ref name=Michael156&gt;[[George Michael (professor)|Michael, George]].

Michael writes that Duke, a former [[Ku Klux Klan]] leader, has been at the forefront of efforts to foster cooperation between the far right and the Islamic world, in what Michael calls a "cross-fertilization of rhetoric" against Zionism, Jews, and Israel. &lt;ref name=Michael309/&gt; Duke presented two lectures in [[Bahrain]] in 2002 entitled "The Global Struggle against Zionism," and "Israeli Involvement in September 11," after being invited by the Discover Islam Center, an Islamist group who admired the anti-Semitic rhetoric on Duke's website. Duke told Michael: "The ADL issued a protest to Bahrain [saying] 'How can they have a white supremacist in Bahrain?' But the people in Bahrain understand very well that I am not a white supremacist and that I am a European American who wants to preserve my heritage ... but the real danger to all heritages is Jewish supremacism ..." &lt;ref name=Michael162&gt;[[George Michael (professor)|Michael, George]].

In November 2005, Duke addressed a rally in [[Syria]], saying "It saddens my heart to tell you that part of my country is occupied by Zionists, just as part of your country, the [[Golan Heights]], is occupied by Zionists. [They] occupy most of the American media and now control much of the American government ...

===The left and "anti-Zionism"===

They wrote that anti-Zionism has "developed to a point where supposed organizations of the Left are willing to entertain openly anti-Semitic speakers and to form alliances with anti-Semitic groups."&lt;ref name=euston&gt;[http://eustonmanifesto.org/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=41 "The Euston Manifesto"], March 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Those who argue in favor of the centrality of the left to the new anti-Semitism say that anti-Zionism may function as a [[proxy]] for anti-Semitism, allowing a socially acceptable opposition to the Israeli state to be espoused, rather than a socially unacceptable religious or ethnic hatred. At the same time, genuine grievances against Israel stemming from the Arab-Israeli conflict may become anti-Semitic in character and may manifest themselves as hostility toward Jews in general. &lt;ref&gt;Daniel Lazare wrote, in a paraphrase of [[August Bebel]], that: "Anti-Semitism is the anti-Zionism of fools ...," an allusion to Bebel's famous remark, "Anti-Semitism is the socialism of fools." (Lazare, Daniel. [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20051219/lazare "The Chosen People"], ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', December 19, 2005, p.36, accessed January 8, 2005.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham Foxman]] of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) has said: "The harsh but un-deniable truth is this: what some like to call anti-Zionism is, in reality, anti-Semitism &amp;mdash; always, everywhere, and for all time ... Therefore, anti-Zionism is not a politically legitimate point of view but rather an expression of [[bigotry]] and hatred." ([[Brian Klug|Klug, Brian]]. [http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20040202&amp;s=klug "The Myth of the New Anti-Semitism"]. ''[[The Nation]]'', February 2, 2004) Foxman argues that it is anti-Semitic to criticize the occupation by the Jews of the West Bank if one does not also criticize the "Indian Hindus and their occupation of Muslim [[Kashmir]]." ([[Abraham Foxman|Foxman, Abraham H.]] [http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/speech.asp New Excuses, Old Hatred: Worldwide Anti-Semitism In Wake Of 9/11].

Historian [[Robert Wistrich]] argues that "left-leaning Judeophobes ... never call themselves 'anti-Semitic.' Indeed, they are usually indignant at the very suggestion that they have anything against Jews. Such denials notwithstanding, they are usually obsessed with stigmatizing Israel ..." &lt;ref name=Wistrich1112&gt;Wistrich, Robert S. {{PDFlink|[http://www.ajc.org/atf/cf/%7B42D75369-D582-4380-8395-D25925B85EAF%7D/wistrich.pdf "European Anti-Semitism Reinvents Itself"]}}, American Jewish Committee, 2005, pp 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Wistrich adds that not all criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic &amp;mdash; his checklist to identify the "anti-Semitic wolf in anti-Israeli sheep's clothing" includes the singling-out by writers of the "Jewish lobby" or the "Jewish vote"; complaining about Jewish solidarity with Israel; gratuitous emphasis on Jewish wealth or alleged Jewish control of the media; calls for economic boycotts directed exclusively against Israeli products and academic institutions; and the assertion that Jews reject all criticism as anti-Semitic. &lt;ref name=Wistrich1112/&gt;

[[Gerry Gable]], publisher of the anti-fascist ''[[Searchlight magazine]]'', agrees that "a lot of anti-semitism is driven by the left.

Radu Ioanid, director of the Meed Registry of Jewish Holocaust Survivors at the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], writes in his foreword to ''Rising from the Muck'', [[Pierre-André Taguieff]]'s book about the new anti-Semitism in Europe, that during the student uprising in France in 1968, protesters could be heard shouting: "''Nous sommes tous des Juifs Allemands''" ("We are all German Jews") in support of Daniel Cohn-Bendit, one of their expelled leaders. In 2002, in contrast, the slogans heard at rallies in Paris were "Death to the Jews" and "Jews to the ovens." &lt;ref name=Ioanidxi&gt;Ioanid, Radu.

A group of left-wing British academics, journalists, and activists founded the [[Euston Manifesto]] in April 2006, a new declaration of principles for the democratic left. It declares that: "'Anti-Zionism' has now developed to a point where supposed organizations of the Left are willing to entertain openly anti-Semitic speakers and to form alliances with anti-Semitic groups. Amongst educated and affluent people are to be found individuals unembarrassed to claim that the [[Iraq war]] was fought on behalf of Jewish interests, or to make other 'polite' and subtle allusions to the harmful effect of Jewish influence in international or national politics — remarks of a kind that for more than fifty years after [[the Holocaust]] no one would have been able to make without publicly disgracing themselves." &lt;ref name=euston/&gt;

The association of anti-Zionism with new anti-Semitism has been controversial. British writer [[Tariq Ali]] has argued that the campaign against "the supposed new 'anti-semitism'" in modern Europe is in effect a "cynical ploy on the part of the Israeli Government to seal off the Zionist state from any criticism of its regular and consistent brutality against the Palestinians."&lt;ref name=ali/&gt; Ali argues that the new anti-Semitism is, in fact, "Zionist blackmail," and that Israel, far from being a victim, is "the strongest state in the region. It possesses real, not imaginary, weapons of mass destruction. It possesses more tanks and bomber jets and pilots than the rest of the Arab world put together. To say that the Zionist state is threatened by any Arab country is pure demagogy." &lt;ref name=ali/&gt;&lt;ref name=beaumont&gt;Beaumont, Peter. [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/worldview/story/0,11581,651685,00.html "The new anti-semitism?"], ''The Observer'', February 17, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Chomsky-head.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Professor [[Noam Chomsky]] argues that traditional anti-Semitism is ignored while criticism of Israel is vilified. &lt;ref name=Chomsky92&gt;[[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky, Noam]].

Although proponents of the concept of the new anti-Semitism agree that it appeared to start, or gain [[momentum]], around the beginning of the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada]], they refuse to accept that anti-Israel or anti-Zionist feeling may be a justifiably critical response to Israel's handling of the uprising, according to Peter Beaumont, writing in ''[[The Observer]]''. He argues that "Israel's brutal response to the often equally reprehensible anti-Israeli Palestinian violence of the intifada has produced one of the most vigorous media critiques of Israel's policies in the European media in a generation. The reply to this criticism, say those most vocal in reporting the existence of the new anti-Semitism, particularly in the Israeli press, is devastating in its simplicity: criticise Israel, and you are an anti-Semite just as surely as if you were throwing paint at a [[synagogue]] in [[Paris]]." Israel cannot be declared out of bounds, writes Beaumont, for fear of invoking Europe's "last great taboo &amp;mdash; the fear of being declared an anti-Semite." &lt;ref name=beaumont/&gt;

[[Noam Chomsky]], professor of linguistics at [[MIT]], maintains that Jewish groups see criticism of Israeli policies as examples of new anti-Semitism while turning a blind eye to traditional anti-Semitism. He cites the allegations in 1988 that several known anti-Semites occupied senior positions in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. &lt;ref name=Chomsky92/&gt;&lt;ref name=Berke&gt;Berke, Richard L. "Bush Panelist Out After Reports of Anti-Jewish Ties," ''New York Times,'' September 9, 1988, p. A15 (reporting that Jerome Brentar, a [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] travel agent, was dismissed from a Republican Party advisory panel after it was brought to public attention that Brentar had raised funds and made public speeches to defend [[John Demjanjuk]], a fellow-Cleveland resident and former Cleveland autoworker, against the unfair death sentence that the Israeli court had imposed after finding that Demjanjuk had "committed atrocities as a guard at the Treblinka camp in Nazi-occupied Poland.") In prefacing the announcement of the dismissal of Brentar from the advisory panel, [[James A. Baker]], the [[George Herbert Walker Bush|Bush]] campaign chairman had said, "there is absolutely no room for anti-Semitism or bigotry of any sort in our campaign."  ''Id.''  ''See also,'' Rosenthal, Andrew.  "Campaign Tactics Provoke New Charges," ''New York Times,'' October 31, 1988, p. B6 (comparing political attack fliers published by rival state party officials). The Maryland state Republican Party had published a flier that "showed a picture of [[Michael Dukakis|Mr. Dukakis]] and [[Willie Horton]], a murderer who escaped while on furlough from a Massachusetts prison and later raped a Maryland woman and stabbed her fiancé;"  the flier asked, "'Is this your pro-family team for 1988,' ... referring repeatedly to the 'Dukakis/Horton team.'" In response to complaints about this flier, James A. Baker responded by attacking the similar untruthfulness in the flier by California Democratic party affiliates that claimed that "'anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi activists' were infiltrating the Bush campaign."  ''Id.'' &lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New Republic]]'' argued that the discovery of "seven aging [[Eastern Europe]]an fascists in the Republican apparatus" wasn't the threat it was made out to be; the greater threat lay in the anti-Semitism of the left, which had a salient agenda: "the delegitimization of the Jewish national movement".

Groups monitoring [[hate speech]] and violence in the [[European Union]] have noted an upswing in attacks on Jewish people and Jewish institutions in many European countries. &lt;ref name=State-1&gt;[http://usinfo.state.gov/eur/Archive/2005/Jan/05-93928.html?chanlid=eur (U.S.) State Department report on Anti-Semitism: Europe and Eurasia], excerpted from a longer piece, and covering the period of July 1, 2003 &amp;ndash; December 15, 2004.

:* Denying the Jewish people the right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor;
:* Applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation;

The inquiry adopted the view of racism expressed by the MacPherson report after the murder of [[Stephen Lawrence]], namely that a racist act is defined by its victim, and that it is the Jewish community that is in the best position to determine what is anti-Semitic. &lt;ref name=APP1&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://thepcaa.org/Report.pdf "Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism"]}}, September 2006, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The report states that left-wing activists and Muslim extremists are using criticism of Israel as a "pretext" for anti-Semitism, &lt;ref name=Temko/&gt; and that the "most worrying discovery" is that anti-Semitism appears to be entering the mainstream. &lt;ref name=BBCreport&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5319716.stm "MPs urge action on anti-Semitism"], BBC News, September 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The inquiry calls for the adoption of a clearer definition of anti-Semitism that reflects its "complex and multi-faceted" nature. &lt;ref name=BBCreport/&gt; It argues that anti-Zionism may become anti-Semitic when it adopts a view of Zionism as a "global force of unlimited power and malevolence throughout history," a definition that "bears no relation to the understanding that most Jews have of the concept: that is, a movement of Jewish national liberation ..." Having re-defined Zionism, traditional anti-Semitic [[motif]]s of Jewish "conspiratorial power, manipulation and subversion" are transferred from Jews onto Zionism. This is "at the core of the 'New Anti-Semitism'," the report concludes, adding that many of those who gave evidence called anti-Zionism "the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of antisemitic movements." &lt;ref name=APP22&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://thepcaa.org/Report.pdf "Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism"]}}, September 2006, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greville Janner|Lord Janner of Braunstone]] gave evidence regarding anti-Semitic remarks made to him in Parliament. After the arrest of [[Saddam Hussein]], for example, another peer approached him and said: "We've got rid of Saddam Hussein now. Your lot are next." When asked what she meant by "your lot," she replied: "Yes, you cannot go on killing Palestinians forever, you know." &lt;ref name=APP17&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://thepcaa.org/Report.pdf "Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism"]}}, September 2006, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oona King]], former MP for Bethnal Green and Bow, gave evidence that many of her former constituents told her they could not vote for her because she was funded by the [[Mossad|Israeli Secret Service]].&lt;ref name=APP17/&gt;

===United Nations ===
{{Antisemitism}}
General-Secretary [[Kofi Annan]] told a June 2004 seminar on anti-Semitism that "[i]t is hard to believe that 60 years after the tragedy of the Holocaust, anti-Semitism is once again rearing its head. But it is clear that we are witnessing an alarming resurgence of these phenomena in new forms and manifestations." &lt;ref name=Annan&gt;[[Kofi Annan|Annan, Kofi]]. [http://www.un.org/Pubs/chronicle/2004/webArticles/062104_sg_remarks.asp "Opening Remarks at DPI Seminar on anti-Semitism"], ''The UN Chronicle'', accessed March 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He has called the 1975 General Assembly resolution equating Zionism with racism, repealed in 1991, "lamentable," saying that "its negative resonance even today is difficult to overestimate," &lt;ref name=Matas&gt;Matas, David. ''Anti-Zionism and Anti-Semitism''. Dundurn Press, Toronto, 2005, pp. 129-144.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A number of commentators argue that the [[United Nations]] has condoned anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/UN/unantisem.html "Anti-Semitism in the United Nations"], UN Watch, February 1998 (originally published December 1997), accessed March 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawrence Summers]], then-president of [[Harvard University]], wrote that the UN's World Conference on Racism failed to condemn human rights abuses in China, Rwanda, or anywhere in the Arab world, while raising Israel's alleged "ethnic cleansing" and "crimes against humanity." &lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence Summers|Summers, Lawrence H.]] [http://www.president.harvard.edu/speeches/2002/morningprayers.html Address at morning prayers], September 17, 2002. On the site of [[Harvard University]], accessed January 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 

David Matas, senior counsel to [[B'nai B'rith|B'nai Brith Canada]], has written that the UN is a forum for anti-Semitism. &lt;ref name=Matas/&gt; He argues that statements are made within the UN that would not be tolerated within any democratic parliament, citing the example of the Palestinian representative to the UN [[United Nations Human Rights Commission|Human Rights Commission]] who, in an echo of the traditional [[blood libel]], claimed in 1997 that Israeli doctors had injected Palestinian children with the [[AIDS]] virus. &lt;ref name=Matas/&gt; Congressman [[Steve Chabot]] told the U.S. [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 2005 that the commission took "several months to correct in its record a statement by the [[Syria]]n ambassador that Jews allegedly had killed non-Jewish children to make [[Matzo|unleavened bread]] for [[Passover]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house.gov/chabot/UNamend2005.html House Passes Chabot’s Bipartisan United Nations Reform Amendment], June 17, 2005. Accessed March 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anne Bayefsky]], a Canadian legal scholar who addressed the UN about its treatment of Israel, argues that the UN hijacks the language of human rights to discriminate and demonize Jews. She writes that over one quarter of the resolutions condemning a state's human rights violations have been directed at Israel. "But there has never been a single resolution about the decades-long repression of the civil and political rights of 1.3 billion people in [[China]], or the million female migrant workers in [[Saudi Arabia]] kept as virtual slaves, or the virulent racism which has brought 600,000 people to the brink of starvation in [[Zimbabwe]]." &lt;ref&gt;[[Anne Bayefsky|Bayefsky, Anne]]. [http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110005245 One Small Step], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', June 21, 2004, accessed January 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years of its existence, she writes, the Human Rights Commission focused only on themes. When it shifted its focus to countries, it targeted only [[South Africa]] and Israel, and for six years, from 1969 until 1975, those two countries were the only two the Commission would consider. For the last 40 years, almost 30 percent of country-specific resolutions and 15 percent of the Commission's time has been directed against Israel. &lt;ref&gt;[[Anne Bayefsky|Bayefsky, Anne]]. "The UN and the Jews", ''Commentary Magazine'', February 2004 &lt;/ref&gt; During its annual six-week session in 2002, the Commission spent half its time on Israel, more than it spent on all the other countries in the world combined. &lt;ref name=Matas/&gt;

===United States===
The U.S. [[United States Department of State|State Department]]'s 2004 ''[[Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004|Report on Global Anti-Semitism]]'' identified four sources of rising anti-Semitism, particularly in Europe:
* "Traditional anti-Jewish prejudice ... This includes ultra-nationalists and others who assert that the Jewish community controls governments, the media, international business, and the financial world."
* "Strong anti-Israel sentiment that crosses the line between objective criticism of Israeli policies and anti-Semitism."
* "Anti-Jewish sentiment expressed by some in Europe's growing Muslim population, based on longstanding antipathy toward both Israel and Jews, as well as Muslim opposition to developments in Israel and the occupied territories, and more recently in Iraq."
* "Criticism of both the United States and globalization that spills over to Israel, and to Jews in general who are identified with both." &lt;ref name="State-1"/&gt;

====Yale University====
[[Edward H. Kaplan|Edward Kaplan]] and [[Charles A. Small|Charles Small]] of [[Yale University]] conducted a study based on a survey of 5,000 people: 500 citizens in each of 10 European countries. Their report, published in August 2006, concluded that anti-Israel sentiment reliably predicted the probability that an individual was an anti-Semite, with the likelihood of measured anti-Semitism increasing with the extent of anti-Israel sentiment observed. The authors write that, based on their analysis, "when an individual's criticism of Israel becomes sufficiently severe, it does become reasonable to ask whether such criticism is a mask for underlying anti-Semitism." &lt;ref name=KaplanSmall&gt;[[Edward H. Kaplan|Kaplan, Edward H.]] &amp; [[Charles A. Small|Small, Charles A.]] {{PDFlink|[http://www.h-net.org/~antis/papers/jcr_antisemitism.pdf "Anti-Israel sentiment predicts anti-Semitism in Europe"]}}, ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'', Vol 50, No. 4, 548-561, August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study found that 56 percent of those who voiced strong anti-Israel opinions held anti-Semitic views. Those who believed the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] "intentionally targets Palestinian civilians" and that Palestinian suicide bombers who target Israeli civilians are "justified" also believed that "Jews don't care what happens to anyone but their own kind," "Jews have a lot of irritating faults," and "Jews are more willing than others to use shady practices to get what they want." &lt;ref name=CongerYale&gt;[[Edward H. Kaplan|Kaplan, Edward H.]] &amp; [[Charles A. Small|Small, Charles A.]] {{PDFlink|[http://www.h-net.org/~antis/papers/jcr_antisemitism.pdf "Anti-Israel sentiment predicts anti-Semitism in Europe"]}}, ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'', Vol 50, No. 4, 548-561, August 2006, cited in Conger, George. [http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1154526011293&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull "UK MPs find leap in anti-Semitism"], ''The Jerusalem Post'', September 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The percentage of those expressing anti-Semitic views increased with age and decreased with income level; men were more likely to be anti-Semitic than women; the degree of social interaction with Jews had no significant impact; individuals who were less tolerant of illegal immigrants were more likely to express anti-Semitic views; and Muslims were disproportionately more likely to hold anti-Semitic views than Christians, Jews, or those with no religious beliefs. &lt;ref name=CongerYale/&gt;

In September 2006, Yale announced that it had established the Yale Initiative for Interdisciplinary Study of Antisemitism [http://www.isgap.org/], the first university-based institute in North America dedicated to the study of anti-Semitism. Charles Small, who will head the institute, said in a press release that anti-Semitism has "reemerged internationally in a manner that many leading scholars and policy makers take seriously ... Increasingly, Jewish communities around the world feel under threat. It's almost like going back into the lab. I think we need to understand the current manifestation of this disease." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/19/america/NA_GEN_US_Yale_Anti_Semitism.php "Yale Creates Center to Study Antisemitism"], ''Associated Press'', September 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
