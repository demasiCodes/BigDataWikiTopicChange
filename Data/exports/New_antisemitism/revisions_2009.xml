'''New antisemitism''' is the concept that a new form of [[antisemitism]] has developed in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, emanating simultaneously from the [[left-wing politics|left]], the [[Right-wing politics|right]], and [[fundamentalist Islam]], and tending to manifest itself as opposition to [[Zionism]] and the [[State of Israel]].

The concept generally posits that much of what purports to be criticism of [[Israel]] by various individuals and world bodies, is, in fact, tantamount to demonization, and that, together with an international resurgence of attacks on [[Jews]] and [[Jewish symbols]], and an increased acceptance of antisemitic beliefs in public discourse, such demonization represents an evolution in the appearance of antisemitic beliefs.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Proponents of the concept argue that [[anti-Zionism]], [[anti-Americanism]], [[anti-globalization]], [[third worldism]], and demonization of [[Israel]], or double standards applied to its conduct, may be linked to antisemitism, or constitute disguised antisemitism.&lt;ref name=Taguieff&gt;Taguieff, Pierre-André. ''Rising From the Muck: The New Anti-Semitism in Europe''. Ivan R. Dee, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Critics of the concept argue that it conflates anti-Zionism with antisemitism, defines legitimate criticism of [[Israel]] too narrowly and demonization too broadly, trivializes the meaning of antisemitism, and exploits antisemitism in order to silence debate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Klug|Klug, Brian]].

==History of the concept==
=== 1960s: Origins ===
French philosopher [[Pierre-André Taguieff]] has argued that the first wave of what he describes as "la nouvelle judéophobie" emerged in the Arab-Muslim world and the Soviet sphere following the 1967 [[Six Day War]], citing papers by Jacques Givet (1968) and historian [[Léon Poliakov]] (1969) in which the idea of a new anti-Semitism rooted in anti-Zionism was discussed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre-André Taguieff]] cites the following early works on the new antisemitism: Jacques Givet, ''La Gauche contre Israel? Essai sur le néo-antisémitisme, Paris 1968; idem, "Contre une certain gauche," ''Les Nouveaux Cahiers'', No. 13-14, Spring-Summer 1968, pp. 116-119; Léon Poliakov, ''De l'antisionisme a l'antisémitisme, Paris 1969; Shmuel Ettinger, "Le caractère de l'antisémitisme contemporain," ''Dispersion et Unité'', No. 14, 1975, pp. 141-157; and Michael Curtis, ed., ''Antisemitism in the Modern World, Boulder, 1986. All cited in [[Pierre-André Taguieff]]. ''Rising from the Muck: The New Anti-Semitism in Europe''. Ivan R. Dee, 2004, p. 159-160, footnote 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that anti-Jewish themes centered on the demonical figures of Israel and what he calls "fantasy-world Zionism": that Jews plot together, seek to conquer the world, and are imperialistic and bloodthirsty, which gave rise to the reactivation of stories about ritual murder and the poisoning of food and water supplies.&lt;ref name=Taguieff62&gt;[[Pierre André Taguieff|Taguieff, Pierre André]]. ''Rising from the Muck: The New Anti-Semitism in Europe''. Ivan R. Dee, 2004, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1970s: Early debates ===
In 1974, Arnold Forster and Benjamin Epstein of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] published a book entitled ''The New anti-Semitism'', expressing concern about what they described as new manifestations of antisemitism coming from radical left, radical right, and "pro-Arab" figures in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Forster, Arnold &amp; Epstein, Benjamin, ''The New Anti-Semitism''. McGraw-Hill 1974, p.165. See for instance chapters entitled "[[Gerald Smith]]'s Road" (19-48), "The Radical Right" (285-296), "Arabs and Pro-Arabs" (155-174), "The Radical Left" (125-154)&lt;/ref&gt; Forster and Epstein argued that it took the form of indifference to the fears of the Jewish people, apathy in dealing with anti-Jewish bias, and an inability to understand the importance of Israel to Jewish survival.&lt;ref name=ForsterEpstein324&gt;Forster, Arnold &amp; Epstein, Benjamin, ''The New Anti-Semitism''. McGraw-Hill 1974, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:Protests Edinburgh 10 1 2009 5.JPG|right|thumb|A sign held at a protest in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]] on [[January 10]], [[2009]] ]]
Reviewing Forster and Epstein's work in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', Earl Raab argued that a "new anti-Semitism" was indeed emerging in America, in the form of opposition to the collective rights of the Jewish people, but he criticized Forster and Epstein for conflating it with anti-Israel bias.&lt;ref&gt;Raab, Earl. "Is there a New Anti-Semitism?", ''Commentary'', May 1974, pp. 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Allan Brownfeld writes that Forster and Epstein's new definition of antisemitism trivialized the concept by turning it into "a form of political blackmail" and "a weapon with which to silence any criticism of either Israel or U.S. policy in the Middle East,"&lt;ref&gt;Brownfeld, Allan. [http://www.jstor.org/view/0377919x/di009622/00p0074z/0 "Anti-Semitism: Its Changing Meaning"], ''Journal of Palestine Studies'', Vol. 16, No. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; while Edward S. Shapiro, in "A Time for Healing: American Jewry Since World War II," has written that "Forster and Epstein implied that the new anti-Semitism was the inability of Gentiles to love Jews and Israel enough."&lt;ref&gt;Edward S. Shapiro. ''A Time for Healing: American Jewry Since World War II''. Johns Hopkins University Press. 1992. ISBN 0801843472. Page 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1980s - present day: political convergence ===
Historian [[Robert Wistrich]] addressed the issue in a 1984 lecture delivered in the home of [[President of Israel|Israeli President]] [[Chaim Herzog]], in which he argued that a "new anti-Semitic anti-Zionism" was emerging, distinguishing features of which were the equation of Zionism with [[Nazism]] and the belief that Zionists had actively collaborated with Nazis during [[World War II]]. He argued that such claims were prevalent in the Soviet Union, but added that similar rhetoric had been taken up by a part of the radical Left, particularly [[Trotskyist]] groups in Western Europe and America.&lt;ref name=Wistrich1984&gt;[[Robert S. Wistrich|Wistrich, Robert]]. [http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/Antizionism.htm "Anti-zionism as an Expression of Anti-Semitism in Recent Years"], lecture delivered to the Study Circle on World Jewry in the home of the [[President of Israel]], December 10, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments for and against the concept==
===A new phenomenon===

[[Jack Fischel]], former chair of history at [[Millersville University of Pennsylvania]], writes that new antisemitism is a new phenomenon stemming from a coalition of "leftists, vociferously opposed to the policies of Israel, and right-wing antisemites, committed to the destruction of Israel, [who] were joined by millions of [[Muslim]]s, including [[Arabs]], who immigrated to Europe ... and who brought with them their hatred of Israel in particular and of Jews in general." It is this new political alignment, he argues, that makes new antisemitism unique.&lt;ref name=Fischel&gt;Fischel, Jack R. [http://www.vqronline.org/articles/2005/summer/fischel-new-anti-semitism/ "The New Anti-Semitism"], ''The Virginia Quarterly Review'', Summer 2005, pp. 225-234.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Strauss]] of '' [[Foreign Policy]]'' links it to [[anti-globalism]], describing it as "the medieval image of the 'Christ-killing' Jew resurrected on the editorial pages of cosmopolitan European newspapers.&lt;ref name=strauss272&gt;Strauss, Mark. [http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=2791 "Antiglobalism's Jewish Problem"] in Rosenbaum, Ron (ed). ''Those who forget the past: The Question of Anti-Semitism'', Random House 2004, p 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{rquote|left|''It is the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement refusing to put the Star of David on their ambulances. ... It is neo-Nazis donning checkered Palestinian [[kaffiyeh]]s and Palestinians lining up to buy copies of ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. &amp;mdash; [[Mark Strauss]]&lt;ref name="strauss272"/&gt;}}
The French philosopher [[Pierre-André Taguieff]] argues that antisemitism based on [[racism]] and [[nationalism]] has been replaced by a new form based on anti-racism and [[anti-nationalism]]. He identifies some of its main features as the identification of Zionism and racism; the use of material related to [[Holocaust denial]] e.g. doubts about the number of victims and allegations that there is a "Holocaust industry"; a borrowed discourse from [[third worldism]], [[anti-imperialism]], [[anti-colonialism]], [[anti-Americanism]], and [[anti-globalization]]; and the dissemination of what he calls the "myth" of the "intrinsically good Palestinian &amp;mdash; the innocent victim ''par excellence''."&lt;ref name=Taguieff67&gt;Taguieff, Pierre-André. ''Rising From the Muck: The New Anti-Semitism in Europe''. Ivan R. Dee, 2004, pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no indices of measurement of the new antisemitism, according to [[Irwin Cotler]], Professor of Law at [[McGill University]]. Cotler argues that classical antisemitism is discrimination against Jews as individuals, and that the new antisemitism, in contrast, "is anchored in discrimination against the Jews as a people—and the embodiment of that expression in Israel. In each instance the essence of anti-Semitism is the same—an assault upon whatever is the core of Jewish self-definition at any moment in time."  It is hard to measure, because the indices used by governments to detect discrimination &amp;mdash; standard of living, housing, health, and employment &amp;mdash; are useful only in measuring discrimination against individuals. This makes it difficult to show that the concept is a valid one, he writes.&lt;ref name=Cotler&gt;[[Irwin Cotler|Cotler, Irwin]]. [http://frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=12191 "Human Rights and the New Anti-Jewishness"], ''FrontPageMagazine.com'', [[February 16]], [[2004]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Irwin Cotler]] defines '"classical or traditional anti-Semitism" as "the discrimination against, denial of or assault upon the rights of Jews to live as equal members of whatever host society they inhabit", and "new anti-Semitism" as "discrimination against the right of the Jewish people to live as an equal member of the family of nations - the denial of and assault upon the Jewish people's right even to live - with Israel as the "collective Jew among the nations."&lt;ref&gt;Making the world 'Judenstaatrein,' Feb. 22, 2009, IRWIN COTLER , THE JERUSALEM POST [http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1233304849224&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In early 2009, 125 parliamentarians from various countries gathered in [[London]] for the founding conference of a group called the "Interparliamentary Coalition for Combating Anti-Semitism" (ICCA).  They suggest that while classical anti-semitism "overlaps" modern anti-semitism, it is a different phenomenon and a more dangerous one for Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1233304849224&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter ''Making the world "Judenstaatrein"''] The Jerusalem Post, February 22, 2009 Erwin Cotler&lt;/ref&gt;

===A new phenomenon, but not antisemitism===
[[Image:BrianKlug.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Brian Klug]] argues that the new prejudice is not antisemitism, new or old; nor a mutation of an existing virus, but "a brand new 'bug'."&lt;ref name=KlugCatalyst&gt;[[Brian Klug|Klug, Brian]]. [http://www.catalystmagazine.org.uk/Default.aspx.LocID-0hgnew0bv.RefLocID-0hg01b00100600f009.Lang-EN.htm "In search of clarity"], [[Catalyst Magazine|''Catalyst'']], March 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Brian Klug]], senior research fellow in philosophy at [[St Benet's Hall, Oxford]] &amp;mdash; who gave expert testimony in February 2006 to a British parliamentary inquiry into antisemitism in the UK, and in November 2004 to the Hearing on Anti-Semitism at the German [[Bundestag]] &amp;mdash; argues against the idea that there is a "single, unified phenomenon" that could be called "new" antisemitism. He accepts that there is reason for the Jewish community to be concerned, but argues that any increase in antisemitic incidents is attributable to classical antisemitism. Proponents of the new antisemitism concept, he writes, see an organizing principle that allows them to formulate a new concept, but it is only in terms of this concept that many of the examples cited in evidence of it count as examples in the first place.&lt;ref name=Klug&gt;[[Brian Klug|Klug, Brian]]. [http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20040202&amp;s=klug The Myth of the New Anti-Semitism]. ''[[The Nation]]'', February 2, 2004, accessed [[January 9]], [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the creation of the concept may be based on a circular argument or [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]]. He argues that it is an unhelpful concept, because it devalues the term "antisemitism," leading to widespread cynicism about the use of it. People of goodwill who support the Palestinians resent being falsely accused of antisemitism.&lt;ref name="KlugCatalyst"/&gt;

Klug defines classical antisemitism as "an ingrained European fantasy about Jews as Jews," arguing that whether Jews are seen as a [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[religion]], or [[ethnicity]], and whether antisemitism comes from the right or the left, the antisemite's image of the Jew is always as "a people set apart, not merely by their customs but by their collective character. They are arrogant, secretive, cunning, always looking to turn a profit. Loyal only to their own, wherever they go they form a state within a state, preying upon the societies in whose midst they dwell. Mysteriously powerful, their hidden hand controls the banks and the media. They will even drag governments into war if this suits their purposes. Such is the figure of 'the Jew,' transmitted from generation to generation."&lt;ref name=KlugRedPepper&gt;[[Brian Klug|Klug, Brian]]. [http://www.jfjfp.org/BackgroundJ/klug_redpepper_2006.htm Israel, Antisemitism and the left], ''Red Pepper'', November 24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{rquote|left|''[W]hen anti-Semitism is everywhere, it is nowhere. And when every anti-Zionist is an anti-Semite, we no longer know how to recognize the real thing--the concept of anti-Semitism loses its significance'' &amp;mdash; [[Brian Klug]]&lt;ref name=Klug /&gt;}}
He argues that, although it is true that the new antisemitism incorporates the idea that antisemitism is hostility to Jews as Jews, the source of the hostility has changed; therefore, to continue using the same expression for it &amp;mdash; antisemitism &amp;mdash; causes confusion. Today's hostility to Jews as Jews is based on the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]], not on ancient European fantasies. Israel proclaims itself as the state of the Jewish people, and many Jews align themselves with Israel for that very reason. It is out of this alignment that the hostility to Jews as Jews arises, rather than hostility to Israelis or to Zionists. Klug agrees that it is a prejudice, because it is a generalization about individuals; nevertheless, he argues, it is "not rooted in the ideology of 'the Jew'," and is therefore a different phenomenon from antisemitism.&lt;ref name=KlugCatalyst/&gt;

[[Norman Finkelstein]] argues that there has been no significant rise in antisemitism: "What does the evidence show? There has been good investigation done, serious investigation. All the evidence shows there's no evidence at all for a rise of a new anti-Semitism, whether in Europe or in North America. The evidence is zero. And, in fact, there's a new book put out by an Israel stalwart. His name is [[Walter Laqueur]], a very prominent scholar. It's called ''The Changing Face of Anti-Semitism''. It just came out, 2006, from [[Oxford University Press]]. He looks at the evidence, and he says no. There's some in Europe among the Muslim community, there's some anti-Semitism, but the notion that in the heart of European society or North American society there's anti-Semitism is preposterous. And in fact &amp;mdash; or no, a significant rise in anti-Semitism is preposterous."&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Amy. [http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=11&amp;ar=479 "Finkelstein on DN! No New Antisemitism"], interview with Norman Finkelstein, August 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to Israel not necessarily antisemitism===
Earl Raab, founding director of the Nathan Perlmutter Institute for Jewish Advocacy at [[Brandeis University]] writes that "[t]here is a new surge of antisemitism in the world, and much prejudice against Israel is driven by such antisemitism," but argues that charges of antisemitism based on anti-Israel opinions generally lack credibility. He writes that "a grave educational misdirection is imbedded in formulations suggesting that if we somehow get rid of antisemitism, we will get rid of anti-Israelism. This reduces the problems of prejudice against Israel to cartoon proportions." Raab describes prejudice against Israel as a "serious breach of morality and good sense," and argues that it is often a bridge to antisemitism, but distinguishes it from antisemitism as such.&lt;ref&gt;Raab, Earl. [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0411/is_4_51/ai_106730943 "Antisemitism, anti-Israelism, anti-Americanism"], ''Judaism'', Fall 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Zipperstein, professor of Jewish Culture and History at [[Stanford University]], argues that a belief in the State of Israel's responsibility for the Arab-Israeli conflict is considered "part of what a reasonably informed, progressive, decent person thinks." He argues that Jews have a tendency to see the State of Israel as a victim because they were very recently themselves "the quintessential victims."&lt;ref name=zipperstein61&gt;Zipperstein, Steven. "Historical Reflections of Contemporary Antisemitism" in Derek J. Penslar et al., ed., ''Contemporary Antisemitism: Canada and the World'', Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2005, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tariq Ali]], a British-Pakistani historian and political activist, argues that the concept of new antisemitism amounts to an attempt to subvert the language in the interests of the State of Israel. He writes that the campaign against "the supposed new 'anti-semitism'" in modern Europe is a "cynical ploy on the part of the Israeli Government to seal off the Zionist state from any criticism of its regular and consistent brutality against the Palestinians....  Criticism of Israel can not and should not be equated with anti-semitism." He argues that most pro-Palestinian, anti-Zionist groups that emerged after the [[Six-Day War]] were careful to observe the distinction between anti-Zionism and antisemitism.&lt;ref name=Ali&gt;[[Tariq Ali|Ali, Tariq]]. [http://www.counterpunch.org/ali03042004.html "Notes on Anti-Semitism, Zionism and Palestine"], ''Counterpunch'', March 4, 2004, first published in ''il manifesto'', [[February 26]], [[2004]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===A third wave===
[[Image:Lewis-pre.jpg|thumb|upright|Professor [[Bernard Lewis]] argues that the new antisemitism &amp;mdash; what he calls "ideological antisemitism" &amp;mdash; has mutated out of religious and racial antisemitism.]]
Historian [[Bernard Lewis]] argues that the new antisemitism represents the third, or ideological, wave of antisemitism, the first two waves being [[Anti-Judaism|religious]] and racial antisemitism.&lt;ref name=LewisBrandeis&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]]. [http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/21832.html "The New Anti-Semitism"], ''The American Scholar'', Volume 75 No. 1, Winter 2006, pp. 25–36 The paper is based on a lecture delivered at [[Brandeis University]] on [[March 24]], [[2004]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis defines antisemitism as a special case of prejudice, hatred, or persecution directed against people who are in some way different from the rest. According to Lewis, antisemitism is marked by two distinct features: Jews are judged according to a standard different from that applied to others, and they are accused of cosmic evil. He writes that what he calls the first wave of antisemitism arose with the advent of [[Christianity]] because of the Jews' rejection of [[Jesus]] as [[Messiah]]. The second wave, racial anti-Semitism, emerged in Spain when large numbers of Jews were forcibly [[Religious conversion|converted]], and doubts about the sincerity of the converts led to ideas about the importance of "''la limpieza de sangre''", purity of blood.&lt;ref name=LewisBrandeis/&gt;

He associates the third wave with the [[Arab]]s, and writes that it arose only in part because of the establishment of the State of Israel. Until the 19th century, [[Muslim]]s had regarded Jews with what Lewis calls "amused, tolerant superiority" &amp;mdash; they were seen as physically weak, cowardly, and unmilitary &amp;mdash; and although Jews living in Muslim countries were not treated as equals, they were shown a certain amount of respect. The Western form of antisemitism &amp;mdash; what Lewis calls "the cosmic, [[satan]]ic version of Jew hatred" &amp;mdash; arrived in the Middle East in several stages, beginning with [[Mission (Christian)|Christian missionaries]] in the 19th century, and continued to grow slowly into the 20th century, up to the establishment of the [[Third Reich]]. He writes that it increased because of the humiliation of the Israeli military victories of 1948 and 1967.&lt;ref name=LewisBrandeis/&gt; ''(See [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] and [[Six Day War]].)''

Into this mix entered the [[United Nations]]. Lewis argues that the United Nations' handling of the 1948 refugee situation convinced the Arab world that discrimination against Jews was acceptable. When the ancient Jewish community in [[East Jerusalem]] was evicted and its monuments desecrated or destroyed, they were offered no help. Similarly, when Jewish refugees fled or were driven out of Arab countries, no help was offered, but elaborate arrangements were made for Arabs who fled or were driven out of the area that became Israel. All the Arab governments involved in the conflict announced that they would not admit Israelis of any religion into their territories, and that they would not give visas to Jews, no matter which country they were citizens of. Lewis argues that the failure of the United Nations to protest sent a clear message to the Arab world.&lt;ref name=LewisBrandeis/&gt;

He writes that this third wave of antisemitism has in common with the first wave that Jews are able to be part of it. With religious antisemitism, Jews were able to distance themselves from Judaism, and Lewis writes that some even reached high rank within the church and the [[Inquisition]]. With racial antisemitism, this was not possible, but with the new, ideological, antisemitism, Jews are once again able to join the critics. The new antisemitism also allows non-Jews, he argues, to criticize or attack Jews without feeling overshadowed by the crimes of the Nazis.&lt;ref name=LewisBrandeis/&gt;

===Antisemitism, but not a new phenomenon===
[[Image:Yehuda Bauer 1.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Yehuda Bauer]] argues that "new" antisemitism is not actually new.]]
[[Yehuda Bauer]], Professor of Holocaust Studies at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], considers the concept "new antisemitism" to be false, since it is in fact old antisemitism that remains latent and recurs whenever it is triggered. In his view, the current trigger is the Israeli situation, and if a compromise were achieved there antisemitism would decline but not disappear.&lt;ref name="HatesRevival"&gt;{{cite journal

Dina Porat, professor at [[Tel Aviv University]] says that, while in principle there is no new antisemitism, we can speak of antisemitism in a new envelope. Otherwise Porat speaks of a new and violent form of antisemitism in Western Europe starting from after the [[Second Intifada]].&lt;ref name="HatesRevival"/&gt;

[[Howard Jacobson]], a British novelist and journalist, calls this phenomenon "Jew-hating pure and simple, the Jew-hating which many of us have always suspected was the only explanation for the disgust that contorts and disfigures faces when the mere word Israel crops up in conversation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Fulford| first = Robert| title = When criticizing Israel becomes ritual| publisher = nationalpost.com| date = 2009-08-15| url = http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2009/08/15/robert-fulford-when-criticizing-israel-becomes-ritual.aspx| accessdate = 2009-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A contradictory political ploy===
[[Norman Finkelstein]] argues that organizations such as the [[Anti-Defamation League]] have brought forward charges of new antisemitism at various intervals since the 1970s, "not to fight antisemitism but rather to exploit the historical suffering of Jews in order to immunize Israel against criticism".&lt;ref name=Finkelstein21&gt;Finkelstein, Norman. ''Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History'', University of California Press, 2005, pp. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that most evidence purporting to show a new antisemitism has been taken from organizations that are linked in some way to Israel, or that have "a material stake in inflating the findings of anti-Semitism," and that some antisemitic incidents reported in recent years either did not occur or were misidentified.&lt;ref name=Finkelstein66/68&gt;Finkelstein, Norman. ''Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History'', University of California Press, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;66-71.&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of the misuse of the term "antisemitism," he cites the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia's 2003 report, which included displays of the [[Palestinian flag]], support for the [[PLO]], and the [[Israel and the apartheid analogy|comparisons between Israel and apartheid-era South Africa]] in its list of antisemitic activities and beliefs.&lt;ref name=Finkelstein37&gt;Finkelstein, Norman. ''Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History'', University of California Press, 2005, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:Norman finkelstein suffolk.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Dr. [[Norman Finkelstein]] writes that anger at what he calls "Israel's brutal occupation has undoubtedly slipped over to an animus against Jews generally," which he describes as "lamentable" but "hardly cause for wonder."&lt;ref name=Finkelstein81&gt;[[Norman Finkelstein|Finkelstein, Norman]]. ''Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History'', University of California Press, 2005, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
He writes that what is called the new antisemitism consists of three components: (i) "exaggeration and fabrication"; (ii) "mislabeling legitimate criticism of Israeli policy"; and (iii) "the unjustified yet predictable spillover from criticism of Israel to Jews generally."&lt;ref name=Finkelstein66&gt;Finkelstein, Norman. ''Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History'', University of California Press, 2005, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that Israel's apologists have denied a causal relationship between Israeli policies and hostility toward Jews, since "if Israeli policies, and widespread Jewish support for them, evoke hostility toward Jews, it means that Israel and its Jewish supporters might themselves be causing anti-Semitism; and it might be doing so because Israel and its Jewish supporters are ''in the wrong''".&lt;ref name=Finkelstein78&gt;Finkelstein, Norman.

Finkelstein asks why, given that the wars in Vietnam and Iraq contributed to [[anti-Americanism]], and the aggression of [[Nazi Germany]] gave rise to anti-[[Teutonic]] sentiment, it surprises us that an occupation by a self-declared Jewish state should cause antipathy towards Jews. The only surprise, he argues, is that the antipathy does not run deeper, given that mainstream Jewish organizations offer uncritical support to Israel; that Israel defines itself juridically as the sovereign state of the Jewish people; and that Jews themselves sometimes argue that to distinguish between Israel and world Jewry is itself an example of antisemitism. He cites [[Phyllis Chesler]] who argues, on the one hand, that "anyone who does not distinguish between Jews and the Jewish state is an anti-Semite," but on the other that "Israel is our heart and soul ... we ''are'' family." Gabriel Schoenfeld, the editor of ''[[Commentary Magazine|Commentary]]'' magazine, writes that "Iranian anti-Semitic propagandists make a point of erasing all distinctions among Israel, Zionism and the Jews," while [[Hillel Halkin]] argues that "Israel is the state of the Jews ... To defame Israel is to defame the Jews." It would seem to be antisemitic, Finkelstein concludes, "both to identify and not to identify Israel with Jews."&lt;ref&gt;[[Phyllis Chesler|Chesler, Phyllis]].

===An inappropriate redefinition===

[[Antony Lerman]], writing in the Israeli journal [[Ha'aretz]] in September 2008, argues that the concept of a "new antisemitism" has brought about "a revolutionary change in the discourse about anti-Semitism".  He writes that most contemporary discussions concerning antisemitism have become focused on issues concerning Israel and Zionism, and that the equation of anti-Zionism with antisemitism has become for many a "new orthodoxy".  He adds that this redefinition has often resulted in "Jews attacking other Jews for their alleged anti-Semitic anti-Zionism".  While Lerman accepts that exposing alleged Jewish antisemitism is "legitimate in principle", he adds that the growing literature in this field "exceeds all reason"; the attacks are often vitriolic, and encompass views that are not inherently anti-Zionist.

Lerman argues that this redefinition has had unfortunate repercussions.  He writes that serious scholarly research into contemporary antisemitism has become "virtually non-existent", and that the subject is now most frequently studied and analyzed by "people lacking any serious expertise in the subject, whose principal aim is to excoriate Jewish critics of Israel and to promote the "anti-Zionism = anti-Semitism" equation".  Lerman concludes that this redefinition has ultimately served to stifle legitimate discussion, and that it cannot create a basis on which to fight antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1020490.html Antony Lerman, "Jews attacking Jews"], ''Ha'aretz'', 12 September 2008, accessed 13 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Beaumont, writing in ''[[The Observer]]'', agrees that proponents of the concept of "new antisemitism" have attempted to co-opt anti-Jewish sentiment and attacks by some European Muslims as a way to silence opposition to the policies of the Israeli government. "[C]riticise Israel," he writes, "and you are an anti-Semite just as surely as if you were throwing paint at a [[synagogue]] in [[Paris]]."&lt;ref name=beaumont&gt;Beaumont, Peter. [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/worldview/story/0,11581,651685,00.html "The new anti-semitism?"], ''The Observer'', [[February 17]], [[2002]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==International perspectives==
===European Union===

The European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC) (superseded in 2007 by the [[European Fundamental Rights Agency]]) noted an upswing in antisemitic incidents in France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Belgium, and The Netherlands between July 2003 and December 2004.&lt;ref name=State&gt;"(U.S.) State Department report on Anti-Semitism: Europe and Eurasia]," excerpted from a longer piece, and covering the period of July 1, 2003 &amp;ndash; December 15, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2004, the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, a part of the [[Council of Europe]], called on its member nations to ensure that anti-racist criminal law covers antisemitism, and in 2005, the EUMC offered a definition of antisemitism to enable a standard definition to be used for data collection:&lt;ref&gt;Whine, Michael. [http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-041-whine.htm "Progress in the Struggle Against Anti-Semitism in Europe: The Berlin Declaration and the European Union Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia's Working Definition of Anti-Semitism"],  ''Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism'',  Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, February 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; "Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred towards Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed towards Jews and non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, towards Jewish community institutions and religious facilities." The paper included some examples:

* Denying the Jewish people the right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor;
* Applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation;
* Using the symbols and images associated with classic anti-Semitism (e.g. claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis;
* Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis;
* Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the State of Israel.&lt;ref name=workingdef&gt;[http://eumc.eu.int/eumc/material/pub/AS/AS-WorkingDefinition-draft.pdf "Working definition of antisemitism"], EUMC.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eu&gt;[http://eumc.europa.eu/eumc/material/pub/AS/AntisemitismOverview_May.pdf "Antisemitism: Summary overview of the situation in the European Union, 2001-2005 (working paper)"], [[European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia]], May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EUMC added that criticism of Israel cannot be regarded as antisemitism so long as it is "similar to that leveled against any other country."&lt;ref name=workingdef/&gt;

====France====
In France, Interior Minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] commissioned a report on racism and antisemitism from [[Jean-Christophe Rufin]], president of [[Action Against Hunger]] and former vice-president of [[Médecins Sans Frontières]], in which Rufin challenges the perception that the new antisemitism in France comes exclusively from [[North Africa]]n immigrant communities and the [[far right]].&lt;ref name=BBCnas&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3759834.stm "French concern about race attacks"], BBC News, October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=statefrance&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51552.htm "France: International Religious Freedom Report 2005"], U.S. Department of State.&lt;/ref&gt; Reporting in October 2004, Rufin writes that "[t]he new anti-Semitism appears more heterogeneous," and identifies what he calls a new and "subtle" form of anti-Semitism in "radical anti-Zionism" as expressed by far-left and anti-globalization groups, in which criticism of Jews and Israel is used as a pretext to "legitimize the armed Palestinian conflict."&lt;ref name=Rufin&gt;[[Jean-Christophe Rufin|Rufin, Jean-Christophe]]. [http://lesrapports.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/BRP/044000500/0000.pdf "Chantier sur la lutte contre le racisme et l'antisémitisme"], presented to the French Ministry of the Interior, October 19, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bryant&gt;Bryant, Elizabeth. "[http://www.upi.com/archive/view.php?archive=1&amp;StoryID=20041020-034122-9850r France stung by new report on anti-Semitism]," United Press International, October 20, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
The British All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism in the UK published its report in September 2006. It adopted the view of racism expressed by the MacPherson report after the murder of [[Stephen Lawrence]], namely that a racist act is defined by its victim, and that it is the Jewish community that is in the best position to determine what is antisemitic.&lt;ref name=APP1&gt;[http://thepcaa.org/Report.pdf "Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism"], September 2006, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The report states that left-wing activists and Muslim extremists are using criticism of Israel as a "pretext" for antisemitism,&lt;ref name=Temko&gt;Temko, Ned. [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1863808,00.html "Critics of Israel 'fuelling hatred of British Jews'"], ''The Observer'', February 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the "most worrying discovery" is that antisemitism appears to be entering the mainstream.&lt;ref name=BBCreport&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5319716.stm MPs deliver anti-Semitism report], BBC News, September 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It argues that anti-Zionism may become antisemitic when it adopts a view of Zionism as a "global force of unlimited power and malevolence throughout history," a definition that "bears no relation to the understanding that most Jews have of the concept: that is, a movement of Jewish national liberation ..." Having re-defined Zionism, the report states, traditional antisemitic motifs of Jewish "conspiratorial power, manipulation and subversion" are often transferred from Jews onto Zionism. The report notes that this is "at the core of the 'New Antisemitism', on which so much has been written," adding that many of those who gave evidence called anti-Zionism "the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of antisemitic movements."&lt;ref name=APP22&gt;[http://thepcaa.org/Report.pdf "Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism"], September 2006, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
In November 2001, in response to an Abu-Dhabi television broadcast showing [[Ariel Sharon]] drinking the blood of Palestinian children, the [[Politics of Israel|Israeli government]] set up the "Coordinating Forum for Countering Antisemitism," headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Rabbi [[Michael Melchior]]. According to Melchior, "in each and every generation antisemitism tries to hide its ugly face behind various disguises &amp;mdash; and hatred of the State of Israel is its current disguise." He added that, "hate against Israel has crossed the red line, having gone from criticism to unbridled antisemitic venom, which is a precise translation of classical antisemitism whose past results are all too familiar to the entire world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://antisemitism.org.il/frontend/english/viewarticle.asp?id=7952&amp;itemtype=2 Announcement by the Forum], November 18, 2001].&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations===
{{See also|Israel, Palestinians and the United Nations}}
A number of commentators argue that the [[United Nations]] has condoned anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/UN/unantisem.html "Anti-Semitism in the United Nations"], UN Watch, February 1998 (originally published December 1997), accessed March 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawrence Summers]], then-president of [[Harvard University]], wrote that the UN's World Conference on Racism failed to condemn human rights abuses in China, Rwanda, or anywhere in the Arab world, while raising Israel's alleged "ethnic cleansing" and "crimes against humanity."&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence Summers|Summers, Lawrence H.]] [http://www.president.harvard.edu/speeches/2002/morningprayers.html Address at morning prayers], September 17, 2002. On the site of [[Harvard University]], accessed January 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 

David Matas, senior counsel to [[B'nai B'rith|B'nai Brith Canada]], has written that the UN is a forum for anti-Semitism, citing the example of the Palestinian representative to the UN [[United Nations Human Rights Commission|Human Rights Commission]] who claimed in 1997 that Israeli doctors had injected Palestinian children with the [[AIDS]] virus.&lt;ref name=Matas&gt;Matas, David. ''Anti-Zionism and Anti-Semitism''. Dundurn Press, Toronto, 2005, pp. 129-144.&lt;/ref&gt;  Congressman [[Steve Chabot]] told the U.S. [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 2005 that the commission took "several months to correct in its record a statement by the [[Syria]]n ambassador that Jews allegedly had killed non-Jewish children to make [[Matzo|unleavened bread]] for [[Passover]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house.gov/chabot/UNamend2005.html House Passes Chabot’s Bipartisan United Nations Reform Amendment], June 17, 2005. Accessed March 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anne Bayefsky]], a Canadian legal scholar who addressed the UN about its treatment of Israel, argues that the UN hijacks the language of human rights to discriminate and demonize Jews. She writes that over one quarter of the resolutions condemning a state's human rights violations have been directed at Israel. "But there has never been a single resolution about the decades-long repression of the civil and political rights of 1.3 billion people in [[China]], or the million female migrant workers in [[Saudi Arabia]] kept as virtual slaves, or the virulent racism which has brought 600,000 people to the brink of starvation in [[Zimbabwe]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne Bayefsky|Bayefsky, Anne]]. [http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110005245 One Small Step], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' [[Op-Ed|opinion article]], June 21, 2004, accessed January 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 report on antisemitism from the [[US Department of State]] to the US Congress, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Motives for criticizing Israel in the UN may stem from legitimate concerns over policy or from illegitimate prejudices. (...) However, regardless of the intent, disproportionate criticism of Israel as barbaric and unprincipled, and corresponding discriminatory measures adopted in the UN against Israel, have the effect of causing audiences to associate negative attributes with Jews in general, thus fueling anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Rickman| first = Gregg J.| title = Contemporary global anti-semitism| publisher = USDOS| year = 2008| url = http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/102301.pdf|format=PDF| accessdate = 2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===United States===
{{See|Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004}}
The U.S. [[United States Department of State|State Department]]'s 2004 ''[[Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004|Report on Global Anti-Semitism]]'' identified four sources of rising anti-Semitism, particularly in Europe:
* "Traditional anti-Jewish prejudice... This includes ultra-nationalists and others who assert that the Jewish community controls governments, the media, international business, and the financial world."
* "Strong anti-Israel sentiment that crosses the line between objective criticism of Israeli policies and anti-Semitism."
* "Anti-Jewish sentiment expressed by some in Europe's growing Muslim population, based on longstanding antipathy toward both Israel and Jews, as well as Muslim opposition to developments in Israel and the occupied territories, and more recently in Iraq."
* "Criticism of both the United States and globalization that spills over to Israel, and to Jews in general who are identified with both."&lt;ref name=State/&gt;

In July 2006, the [[U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] issued a '''Campus Anti-Semitism''' report that declared that "Anti-Semitic bigotry is no less morally deplorable when camouflaged as anti-Israelism or anti-Zionism."&lt;ref&gt; 
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Campus Anti-Semitism (2006) at 72.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, the Commission also announced that anti-Semitism is a "serious problem" on many campuses throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt; 
''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  

In September 2006, [[Yale University]] announced that it had established the [[Yale Initiative for Interdisciplinary Study of Antisemitism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isgap.org Yale Initiative for Interdisciplinary Study of Antisemitism main website]&lt;/ref&gt;, the first university-based institute in North America dedicated to the study of anti-Semitism. Charles Small, head of the institute, said in a press release that anti-Semitism has "reemerged internationally in a manner that many leading scholars and policy makers take seriously ... Increasingly, Jewish communities around the world feel under threat. It's almost like going back into the lab. I think we need to understand the current manifestation of this disease."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/19/america/NA_GEN_US_Yale_Anti_Semitism.php "Yale Creates Center to Study Antisemitism"], ''Associated Press'', September 19, 2006; also see [[Edward H.

Small|Small, Charles A.]] "Anti-Israel sentiment predicts anti-Semitism in Europe," ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'', Vol 50, No. 4, 548-561, August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
YIISA has presented several seminars and working papers on the topic, for instance [http://streaming.yale.edu:8080/ramgen/cmibroadcast/isgap/stauber_042408.rm "The Academic and Public Debate Over the Meaning of the 'New Antisemitism'"].
