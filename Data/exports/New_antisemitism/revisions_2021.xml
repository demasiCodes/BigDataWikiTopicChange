{{Antisemitism |expanded=Manifestations}}

'''New antisemitism''' is the idea that a new form of [[antisemitism]] has developed in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, tending to manifest itself as [[opposition to Zionism]] and [[criticism of the Israeli government]].&lt;ref name="Fastenbauer 2020"&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Fastenbauer |author-first=Raimund |year=2020 |editor1-last=Lange |editor1-first=Armin |editor2-last=Mayerhofer |editor2-first=Kerstin |editor3-last=Porat |editor3-first=Dina |editor4-last=Schiffman |editor4-first=Lawrence H. |title=An End to Antisemitism! – Volume 2: Confronting Antisemitism from the Perspectives of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism |chapter=Islamic Antisemitism: Jews in the Qur’an, Reflections of European Antisemitism, Political Anti-Zionism: Common Codes and Differences |chapter-url=https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110671773-018/pdf |location=[[Berlin]] and [[Boston]] |publisher=[[De Gruyter]] |pages=279-300 |doi=10.1515/9783110671773-018 |doi-access=free |isbn=9783110671773}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|296–297}} The concept is included in some definitions of antisemitism, such as the [[Working Definition of Antisemitism]] and the [[3D test of antisemitism]].

Proponents of the concept argue that [[anti-Zionism]] and demonization of [[Israel]], or [[double standard]]s applied to its conduct (some proponents also include [[anti-Americanism]], [[Anti-globalization movement|anti-globalization]], and [[Third-Worldism]]) may be linked to antisemitism, or constitute disguised antisemitism, particularly when emanating simultaneously from the [[Far-left politics|far-left]], [[Islamism]], and the [[Far-right politics|far-right]].&lt;ref name="Fastenbauer 2020"/&gt;{{rp|296–297}}&lt;ref name=Taguieff&gt;Taguieff, Pierre-André.

Critics of the concept argue that it conflates political anti-Zionism and criticism of the Israeli government with racism, Jew-hatred, and [[the Holocaust]], that it defines legitimate criticism of Israel too narrowly and demonization too broadly, that it trivializes the meaning of antisemitism, and that the concept is used in practice to silence political debate and [[freedom of speech]] regarding the ongoing [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Klug|Klug, Brian]].

== History of the concept ==

=== 1960s: origins ===
French philosopher [[Pierre-André Taguieff]] argues that the first wave of "''la nouvelle judéophobie''" emerged in the Arab-Muslim world and the [[Warsaw Pact|Soviet sphere]] following the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. He cites papers by Jacques Givet (1968) and historian [[Léon Poliakov]] (1969) discussing the idea of a new antisemitism rooted in anti-Zionism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre-André Taguieff]] cites the following early works on the new antisemitism: Jacques Givet, ''La Gauche contre Israel? Essai sur le néo-antisémitisme, Paris 1968; idem, "Contre une certain gauche," ''Les Nouveaux Cahiers'', No. 13-14, Spring-Summer 1968, pp. 116–119; Léon Poliakov, ''De l'antisionisme a l'antisémitisme, Paris 1969; Shmuel Ettinger, "Le caractère de l'antisémitisme contemporain," ''Dispersion et Unité'', No. 14, 1975, pp. 141–157; and Michael Curtis, ed., ''Antisemitism in the Modern World, Boulder, 1986. All cited in [[Pierre-André Taguieff]]. ''Rising from the Muck: The New Anti-Semitism in Europe''. Ivan R. Dee, 2004, p. 159-160, footnote 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that anti-Jewish themes centered on the demonical figures of Israel and what he calls "fantasy-world Zionism": that [[List of conspiracy theories#Anti-semitic conspiracy theories|Jews plot together]], seek to conquer the world, and are imperialistic and bloodthirsty, which gave rise to the reactivation of stories about ritual murder and the poisoning of food and water supplies.&lt;ref name=Taguieff62&gt;[[Pierre André Taguieff|Taguieff, Pierre André]]. ''Rising from the Muck: The New Anti-Semitism in Europe''. Ivan R. Dee, 2004, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1970s: early debates ===
Writing in the [[American Jewish Congress]]' ''[[Congress Bi-Weekly]]'' in 1973, the [[Foreign Minister of Israel]] [[Abba Eban]] identified [[anti-Zionism]] as 'the new anti-Semitism', saying:&lt;ref&gt;''Congress Bi-weekly'', American Jewish Congress, Vol. 40, Issues 2-14, 1973, p. xxv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[R]ecently we have witnessed the rise of the new left which identifies Israel with the establishment, with acquisition, with smug satisfaction, with, in fact, all the basic enemies [...] Let there be no mistake: the new left is the author and the progenitor of the new anti-Semitism. One of the chief tasks of any dialogue with the Gentile world is to prove that the distinction between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism is not a distinction at all. Anti-Zionism is merely the new anti-Semitism. The old classic anti-Semitism declared that equal rights belong to all individuals within the society, except the Jews. The new anti-Semitism says that the right to establish and maintain an independent national sovereign state is the prerogative of all nations, so long as they happen not to be Jewish. And when this right is exercised not by the Maldive Islands, not by the state of Gabon, not by Barbados… but by the oldest and most authentic of all nationhoods, then this is said to be exclusivism, particularism, and a flight of the Jewish people from its universal mission.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1974, [[Arnold Forster (ADL)|Arnold Forster]] and [[Benjamin Epstein]] of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] published a book entitled ''The New anti-Semitism'', expressing additional concern about what they described as new manifestations of antisemitism coming from radical left, radical right, and "pro-Arab" figures in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Forster, Arnold &amp; Epstein, Benjamin, ''The New Anti-Semitism''. McGraw-Hill 1974, p.165. See for instance chapters entitled "[[Gerald L. K. Smith|Gerald Smith]]'s Road" (19–48), "The Radical Right" (285–296), "Arabs and Pro-Arabs" (155–174), "The Radical Left" (125–154)&lt;/ref&gt; Forster and Epstein argued that it took the form of indifference to the fears of the Jewish people, apathy in dealing with anti-Jewish bias, and an inability to understand the importance of Israel to Jewish survival.&lt;ref name=ForsterEpstein324&gt;Forster, Arnold &amp; Epstein, Benjamin, ''The New Anti-Semitism''. McGraw-Hill 1974, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Protests Edinburgh 10 1 2009 5.JPG|thumb|A sign held at a protest in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]] on January 10, 2009 ]]
Reviewing Forster and Epstein's work in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', Earl Raab, founding director of the Nathan Perlmutter Institute for Jewish Advocacy at [[Brandeis University]], argued that a "new anti-Semitism" was indeed emerging in America, in the form of opposition to the collective rights of the Jewish people, but he criticized Forster and Epstein for conflating it with anti-Israel bias.&lt;ref&gt;Raab, Earl. "Is there a New Anti-Semitism?", ''Commentary'', May 1974, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Allan Brownfeld writes that Forster and Epstein's new definition of antisemitism trivialized the concept by turning it into "a form of political blackmail" and "a weapon with which to silence any criticism of either Israel or U.S. policy in the Middle East,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== 1980s–present day: continued debate ===
[[File:Neoantisemismo.jpg|thumb|Graffiti in [[Madrid]], 2003]]
Historian [[Robert Wistrich]] addressed the issue in a 1984 lecture delivered in the home of [[President of Israel|Israeli President]] [[Chaim Herzog]], in which he argued that a "new anti-Semitic anti-Zionism" was emerging, distinguishing features of which were the equation of Zionism with [[Nazism]] and the belief that Zionists had actively collaborated with Nazis during [[World War II]]. He argued that such claims were prevalent in the Soviet Union, but added that similar rhetoric had been taken up by a part of the radical Left, particularly [[Trotskyist]] groups in Western Europe and America.&lt;ref name=Wistrich1984&gt;[[Robert S. Wistrich|Wistrich, Robert]]. [http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/Antizionism.htm "Anti-zionism as an Expression of Anti-Semitism in Recent Years"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512173240/http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/Antizionism.htm |date=2017-05-12 }}, lecture delivered to the Study Circle on World Jewry in the home of the [[President of Israel]], December 10, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked in 2014 if "anti-Zionism is the new anti-Semitism", [[Noam Chomsky]] stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chomsky|first1=Noam|title=TRANSCRIPT of Amy Goodman interview of Noam Chomsky|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2014/11/27/noam_chomsky_at_united_nations_it|access-date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Actually, the locus classicus, the best formulation of this, was by an ambassador to the United Nations, [[Abba Eban]], [...] He advised the American Jewish community that they had two tasks to perform. One task was to show that criticism of the policy, what he called anti-Zionism — that means actually criticisms of the policy of the state of Israel — were anti-Semitism. That's the first task. Second task, if the criticism was made by Jews, their task was to show that it's neurotic self-hatred, needs psychiatric treatment. Then he gave two examples of the latter category. One was [[I.F. Stone]]. The other was me. So, we have to be treated for our psychiatric disorders, and non-Jews have to be condemned for anti-Semitism, if they're critical of the state of Israel. That's understandable why Israeli propaganda would take this position. I don't particularly blame Abba Eban for doing what ambassadors are sometimes supposed to do. But we ought to understand that there is no sensible charge. No sensible charge. There's nothing to respond to. It's not a form of anti-Semitism. It's simply criticism of the criminal actions of a state, period.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Definitions and arguments for and against the concept ==

=== A new phenomenon ===
[[Irwin Cotler]], Professor of Law at [[McGill University]] and a scholar of human rights, has identified nine aspects of what he considers to constitute the "new anti-Semitism":&lt;ref&gt;[[Irwin Cotler]] cited [[Dershowitz, Alan]]. ''The Case For Israel''. [[John Wiley and Sons]], 2003, p. 210-211.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Genocidal antisemitism: calling for the destruction of Israel and the Jewish people.
* Political antisemitism: denial of the Jewish people's right to [[self-determination]], [[Israel and legitimacy|de-legitimization of Israel]] as a state, attributions to Israel of all the world's evils.
* Ideological antisemitism: "Nazifying" Israel by comparing [[Zionism]] and [[racism]].
* Theological antisemitism: convergence of [[Islam and antisemitism|Islamic antisemitism]] and Christian [[Supersessionism|"replacement" theology]], drawing on the classical hatred of Jews.
* Cultural antisemitism: the emergence of anti-Israel attitudes, sentiments, and discourse in "fashionable" salon intellectuals.{{vague|date=January 2014}}
* Economic antisemitism: [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|BDS movements]] and the [[Extraterritoriality|extraterritorial]] application of [[Covenant (law)|restrictive covenants]] against countries trading with Israel.
* Holocaust denial.
* Anti-Jewish racist terrorism.
* International legal discrimination ("Denial to Israel of equality before the law in the international arena").

Cotler defines "classical or traditional anti-Semitism" as "the discrimination against, denial of or assault upon the rights of Jews to live as equal members of whatever host society they inhabit" and "new anti-Semitism" as "discrimination against the right of the Jewish people to live as an equal member of the family of nations{{spaced ndash}}the denial of and assault upon the Jewish people's right even to live{{spaced ndash}}with Israel as the "collective Jew among the nations."&lt;ref name="Judenstaatrein"&gt;Irwin Cotler, [http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1233304849224&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter Making the world 'Judenstaatrein']{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', February 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cotler elaborated on this position in a June 2011 interview for Israeli television. He re-iterated his view that the world is "witnessing a new and escalating [...] and even lethal anti-Semitism" focused on hatred of Israel, but cautioned that this type of antisemitism should not be defined in a way that precludes "free speech" and "rigorous debate" about Israel's activities. Cotler said that it is "too simplistic to say that [[anti-Zionism]], ''per se'', is anti-Semitic" and argued that [[Israel and the apartheid analogy|labelling Israel as an apartheid state]], while in his view "distasteful", is "still within the boundaries of argument" and not inherently antisemitic. He continued: "It's [when] you say, because it's an apartheid state, [that] it has to be dismantled{{spaced ndash}}then [you've] crossed the line into a racist argument, or an anti-Jewish argument."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Sheen]], [http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/anglo-file/canadian-mp-cotler-calling-israel-an-apartheid-state-can-be-legitimate-free-speech-1.370545 "Canadian MP Cotler: Calling Israel an apartheid state can be legitimate free speech"], ''Haaretz'', 1 July 2011. Accessed 7 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jack Fischel]], former chair of history at [[Millersville University of Pennsylvania]], writes that new antisemitism is a new phenomenon stemming from a coalition of "leftists, vociferously opposed to the policies of Israel, and right-wing antisemites, committed to the destruction of Israel, [who] were joined by millions of [[Muslim]]s, including [[Arabs]], who immigrated to Europe... and who brought with them their hatred of Israel in particular and of Jews in general." It is this new political alignment, he argues, that makes new antisemitism unique.&lt;ref name="Fischel"&gt;Fischel, Jack R. [http://www.vqronline.org/articles/2005/summer/fischel-new-anti-semitism/ "The New Anti-Semitism"], ''The Virginia Quarterly Review'', Summer 2005, pp. 225–234.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Strauss (journalist)|Mark Strauss]] of ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' links new antisemitism to [[anti-globalism]], describing it as "the medieval image of the [[Jewish deicide|"Christ-killing" Jew]] resurrected on the editorial pages of cosmopolitan European newspapers."&lt;ref name="strauss272"&gt;Strauss, Mark.

Rajesh Krishnamachari, researcher with the [[South Asia Analysis Group]], analyzed antisemitism in Iran, Turkey, Palestine, Pakistan, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia and posited that the recent surge in antisemitism across the Muslim world should be attributed to political expediency of the local elite in these countries rather than to any theological imperative.&lt;ref name="rajeshPaper"&gt;Tembarai Krishnamachari, Rajesh.

The French philosopher [[Pierre-André Taguieff]] argues that antisemitism based on racism and [[nationalism]] has been replaced by a new form based on [[anti-racism]] and [[anti-nationalism]]. He identifies some of its main features as the identification of Zionism with racism; the use of material related to [[Holocaust denial]] (such as doubts about the number of victims and allegations that there is a "[[The Holocaust Industry|Holocaust industry]]"); a discourse borrowed from [[third worldism]], [[anti-imperialism]], [[anti-colonialism]], [[anti-Americanism]] and [[anti-globalization]]; and the dissemination of what he calls the "myth" of the "intrinsically good Palestinian{{spaced ndash}}the innocent victim ''par excellence''."&lt;ref name=Taguieff67&gt;Taguieff, Pierre-André. ''Rising From the Muck: The New Anti-Semitism in Europe''. Ivan R. Dee, 2004, pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2009, 125 parliamentarians from various countries gathered in [[London]] for the founding conference of a group called the "Interparliamentary Coalition for Combating Anti-Semitism" (ICCA). They suggest that while classical antisemitism "overlaps" modern antisemitism, it is a different phenomenon and a more dangerous one for Jews.&lt;ref name="Judenstaatrein" /&gt;

=== A new phenomenon, but not antisemitism ===
[[File:BrianKlug.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Brian Klug]] argues that the new prejudice is not antisemitism, new or old, nor a mutation of an existing virus, but "a brand new 'bug'".&lt;ref name=KlugCatalyst&gt;[[Brian Klug|Klug, Brian]].

[[Brian Klug]], senior research fellow in philosophy at [[St Benet's Hall, Oxford]] — who gave expert testimony in February 2006 to a British parliamentary inquiry into antisemitism in the UK, and in November 2004 to the Hearing on Anti-Semitism at the German [[Bundestag]] — argues against the idea that there is a "single, unified phenomenon" that could be called "new" antisemitism. He accepts that there is reason for the Jewish community to be concerned, but argues that any increase in antisemitic incidents is attributable to classical antisemitism. Proponents of the new antisemitism concept, he writes, see an organizing principle that allows them to formulate a new concept, but it is only in terms of this concept that many of the examples cited in evidence of it count as examples in the first place.&lt;ref name=Klug&gt;[[Brian Klug|Klug, Brian]].

''[[The Nation]]'', February 2, 2004, accessed January 9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the creation of the concept may be based on a circular argument or [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]]. He argues that it is an unhelpful concept, because it devalues the term "antisemitism," leading to widespread cynicism about the use of it. People of goodwill who support the Palestinians resent being falsely accused of antisemitism.&lt;ref name="KlugCatalyst" /&gt;

Klug defines classical antisemitism as "an ingrained European fantasy about Jews as Jews," arguing that whether Jews are seen as a [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[religion]], or [[ethnicity]], and whether antisemitism comes from the right or the left, the antisemite's image of the Jew is always as "a people set apart, not merely by their customs but by their collective character. They are arrogant, secretive, cunning, always looking to turn a profit. Loyal only to their own, wherever they go they form a state within a state, preying upon the societies in whose midst they dwell. Mysteriously powerful, their hidden hand controls the banks and the media. They will even drag governments into war if this suits their purposes. Such is the figure of 'the Jew,' transmitted from generation to generation."&lt;ref name=KlugRedPepper&gt;[[Brian Klug|Klug, Brian]].

{{rquote|left|[W]hen anti-Semitism is everywhere, it is nowhere. And when every anti-Zionist is an anti-Semite, we no longer know how to recognize the real thing—the concept of anti-Semitism loses its significance.
—[[Brian Klug]]&lt;ref name=Klug /&gt;}}

He argues that although it is true that the new antisemitism incorporates the idea that antisemitism is hostility to Jews as Jews, the source of the hostility has changed; therefore, to continue using the same expression for it — antisemitism — causes confusion. Today's hostility to Jews as Jews is based on the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]], not on ancient European fantasies. Israel proclaims itself as the state of the Jewish people, and many Jews align themselves with Israel for that very reason. It is out of this alignment that the hostility to Jews as Jews arises, rather than hostility to Israelis or to Zionists. Klug agrees that it is a prejudice, because it is a generalization about individuals; nevertheless, he argues, it is "not rooted in the ideology of 'the Jew'," and is therefore a different phenomenon from antisemitism.&lt;ref name=KlugCatalyst /&gt;

[[Norman Finkelstein]] argues that there has been no significant rise in antisemitism: "What does the evidence show? There has been good investigation done, serious investigation. All the evidence shows there's no evidence at all for a rise of a new anti-Semitism, whether in Europe or in North America. The evidence is zero. And, in fact, there's a new book put out by an Israel stalwart. His name is [[Walter Laqueur]], a very prominent scholar. It's called ''The Changing Face of Anti-Semitism''. It just came out, 2006, from [[Oxford University Press]]. He looks at the evidence, and he says no. There's some in Europe among the Muslim community, there's some anti-Semitism, but the notion that in the heart of European society or North American society there's anti-Semitism is preposterous. And in fact — or no, a significant rise in anti-Semitism is preposterous."&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Amy. [http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=11&amp;ar=479 "Finkelstein on DN!

=== Criticism of Israel is not always antisemitism ===
The [[3D Test of Antisemitism]] is a set of criteria put forth by [[Natan Sharansky]] to distinguish legitimate criticism of Israel from antisemitism. The three Ds stand for [[Delegitimization of Israel]], Demonization of Israel, and subjecting Israel to Double standards, each of which, according to the test, indicates antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://umdrive.memphis.edu/jjudaken/public/publications/PoP%20New%20Antisemitism.pdf?uniq=-5aa3|title=So What's New?

Earl Raab writes that "[t]here is a new surge of antisemitism in the world, and much prejudice against Israel is driven by such antisemitism," but argues that charges of antisemitism based on anti-Israel opinions generally lack credibility. He writes that "a grave educational misdirection is imbedded in formulations suggesting that if we somehow get rid of antisemitism, we will get rid of anti-Israelism. This reduces the problems of prejudice against Israel to cartoon proportions." Raab describes prejudice against Israel as a "serious breach of morality and good sense," and argues that it is often a bridge to antisemitism, but distinguishes it from antisemitism as such.&lt;ref&gt;Raab, Earl.

Steven Zipperstein, professor of Jewish Culture and History at [[Stanford University]], argues that a belief in the State of Israel's responsibility for the Arab-Israeli conflict is considered "part of what a reasonably informed, progressive, decent person thinks." He argues that Jews have a tendency to see the State of Israel as a victim because they were very recently themselves "the quintessential victims".&lt;ref name=zipperstein61&gt;Zipperstein, Steven.

=== Accusations of misuse of the term to stifle criticism of Israel ===
[[Norman Finkelstein]] argues that organizations such as the [[Anti-Defamation League]] have brought forward charges of new antisemitism at various intervals since the 1970s, "not to fight antisemitism but rather to exploit the historical suffering of Jews in order to immunize Israel against criticism".&lt;ref name=Finkelstein21&gt;Finkelstein, Norman. ''Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History'', University of California Press, 2005, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that most evidence purporting to show a new antisemitism has been taken from organizations that are linked in some way to Israel, or that have "a material stake in inflating the findings of anti-Semitism," and that some antisemitic incidents reported in recent years either did not occur or were misidentified.&lt;ref name="Finkelstein66/68"&gt;Finkelstein, Norman. ''Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History'', University of California Press, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;66–71.&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of the misuse of the term "antisemitism," he cites the [[Fundamental Rights Agency#History|European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia]]'s 2003 report, which included displays of the [[Palestinian flag]], support for the [[PLO]], and the [[Israel and the apartheid analogy|comparisons between Israel and apartheid-era South Africa]] in its list of antisemitic activities and beliefs.&lt;ref name=Finkelstein37&gt;Finkelstein, Norman.

[[File:Norman finkelstein suffolk.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Norman Finkelstein]] writes that anger at what he calls "Israel's brutal occupation has undoubtedly slipped over to an animus against Jews generally", which he describes as "lamentable" but "hardly cause for wonder"&lt;ref name=Finkelstein81&gt;[[Norman Finkelstein|Finkelstein, Norman]]. ''Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History'', University of California Press, 2005, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
He writes that what is called the new antisemitism consists of three components: (i) "exaggeration and fabrication"; (ii) "mislabeling legitimate criticism of Israeli policy"; and (iii) "the unjustified yet predictable spillover from criticism of Israel to Jews generally."&lt;ref name=Finkelstein66&gt;Finkelstein, Norman. ''Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History'', University of California Press, 2005, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that Israel's apologists have denied a causal relationship between Israeli policies and hostility toward Jews, since "if Israeli policies, and widespread Jewish support for them, evoke hostility toward Jews, it means that Israel and its Jewish supporters might themselves be causing anti-Semitism; and it might be doing so because Israel and its Jewish supporters are ''in the wrong''".&lt;ref name=Finkelstein78&gt;Finkelstein, Norman.

[[Tariq Ali]], a British-Pakistani historian and political activist, argues that the concept of new antisemitism amounts to an attempt to subvert the language in the interests of the State of Israel. He writes that the campaign against "the supposed new 'anti-semitism'" in modern Europe is a "cynical ploy on the part of the Israeli Government to seal off the Zionist state from any criticism of its regular and consistent brutality against the Palestinians.... Criticism of Israel can not and should not be equated with anti-semitism." He argues that most pro-Palestinian, anti-Zionist groups that emerged after the [[Six-Day War]] were careful to observe the distinction between anti-Zionism and antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Tariq|last1=Ali|title=Street Fighting Years: An Autobiography of the Sixties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xZsoDwAAQBAJ|publisher=Verso Books|date=1 May 2018|isbn=978-1-78663-602-7|via=Google Books|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Anthony|last1=Julius|title=Trials of the Diaspora: A History of Anti-Semitism in England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sHAVDAAAQBAJ|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=9 February 2012|isbn=978-0-19-960072-4|via=Google Books|page=525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A third wave ===
[[File:Bernard Lewis in 2012 (1).JPG|thumb|upright|[[Bernard Lewis]] argues that the new antisemitism—what he calls "ideological antisemitism"—has mutated out of religious and racial antisemitism]]
Historian [[Bernard Lewis]] argues that the new antisemitism represents the third, or ideological, wave of antisemitism, the first two waves being [[Anti-Judaism|religious]] and racial antisemitism.&lt;ref name=LewisBrandeis&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]]. [http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/21832.html "The New Anti-Semitism"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908010822/http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/21832.html |date=2011-09-08 }}, ''The American Scholar'', Volume 75 No. 1, Winter 2006, pp. 25–36 The paper is based on a lecture delivered at [[Brandeis University]] on March 24, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis defines antisemitism as a special case of prejudice, hatred, or persecution directed against people who are in some way different from the rest. According to Lewis, antisemitism is marked by two distinct features: Jews are judged according to a standard different from that applied to others, and they are accused of cosmic evil. He writes that what he calls the first wave of antisemitism arose with the advent of [[Christianity]] because of the Jews' rejection of [[Jesus]] as [[Messiah]]. The second wave, racial antisemitism, emerged in Spain when large numbers of Jews were forcibly [[Religious conversion|converted]], and doubts about the sincerity of the converts led to ideas about the importance of "''la limpieza de sangre''", purity of blood.&lt;ref name=LewisBrandeis /&gt;

He associates the third wave with the [[Arab people|Arabs]] and writes that it arose only in part because of the establishment of the State of Israel. Until the 19th century, [[Muslim]]s had regarded Jews with what Lewis calls "amused, tolerant superiority"—they were seen as physically weak, cowardly and unmilitary—and although Jews living in Muslim countries were not treated as equals, they were shown a certain amount of respect. The Western form of antisemitism—what Lewis calls "the cosmic, [[satan]]ic version of Jew hatred"—arrived in the Middle East in several stages, beginning with [[Mission (Christian)|Christian missionaries]] in the 19th century and continued to grow slowly into the 20th century up to the establishment of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]. He writes that it increased because of the humiliation of the Israeli military victories of [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|1948]] and [[Six-Day War|1967]].&lt;ref name=LewisBrandeis /&gt;

Into this mix entered the [[United Nations]]. Lewis argues that the international public response and the United Nations' handling of the 1948 refugee situation convinced the Arab world that discrimination against Jews was acceptable. When the ancient Jewish community in [[East Jerusalem]] was [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|evicted and its monuments desecrated or destroyed]], they were offered no help. Similarly, when Jewish refugees [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|fled or were driven out of Arab countries]], no help was offered, but elaborate arrangements were made for Arabs who fled or were driven out of the area that became Israel. All the Arab governments involved in the conflict announced that they would not admit Israelis of any religion into their territories, and that they would not give visas to Jews, no matter which country they were citizens of. Lewis argues that the failure of the United Nations to protest sent a clear message to the Arab world.&lt;ref name=LewisBrandeis /&gt;

He writes that this third wave of antisemitism has in common with the first wave that Jews are able to be part of it. With religious antisemitism, Jews were able to distance themselves from Judaism, and Lewis writes that some even reached high rank within the church and the [[Inquisition]]. With racial antisemitism, this was not possible, but with the new, ideological, antisemitism, Jews are once again able to join the critics. The new antisemitism also allows non-Jews, he argues, to criticize or attack Jews without feeling overshadowed by the crimes of the Nazis.&lt;ref name=LewisBrandeis /&gt;

=== Antisemitism, but not a new phenomenon ===
[[File:Yehuda Bauer 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Yehuda Bauer]] argues that "new" antisemitism is not actually new]]
[[Yehuda Bauer]], Professor of Holocaust Studies at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], considers the concept "new antisemitism" false, describing the phenomena as old, latent antisemitism that recurs when triggered. In his view, the current trigger is the Israeli situation, and if a compromise were achieved there antisemitism would decline but not disappear.&lt;ref name="HatesRevival"&gt;{{cite journal

Dina Porat, professor at [[Tel Aviv University]] says that, while in principle there is no new antisemitism, we can speak of antisemitism in a new envelope. Otherwise Porat speaks of a new and violent form of antisemitism in Western Europe starting after the [[Second Intifada]].&lt;ref name="HatesRevival" /&gt;

[[Howard Jacobson]], a British novelist and journalist, calls this phenomenon "Jew-hating pure and simple, the Jew-hating which many of us have always suspected was the only explanation for the disgust that contorts and disfigures faces when the mere word Israel crops up in conversation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Fulford| first = Robert| title = When criticizing Israel becomes ritual| publisher = nationalpost.com| date = 2009-08-15| url = https://nationalpost.com/opinion/columnists/story.html?id=686c1928-3518-472c-b2d6-60e15f81e140| archive-url = https://archive.today/20120912182353/http://www.nationalpost.com/opinion/columnists/story.html?id=686c1928-3518-472c-b2d6-60e15f81e140| url-status = dead| archive-date = 2012-09-12| access-date = 2009-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== An inappropriate redefinition ===
[[Antony Lerman]], writing in the Israeli newspaper ''[[Ha'aretz]]'' in September 2008, argues that the concept of a "new antisemitism" has brought about "a revolutionary change in the discourse about anti-Semitism". He writes that most contemporary discussions concerning antisemitism have become focused on issues concerning Israel and Zionism, and that the equation of anti-Zionism with antisemitism has become for many a "new orthodoxy". He adds that this redefinition has often resulted in "Jews attacking other Jews for their alleged anti-Semitic anti-Zionism". While Lerman accepts that exposing alleged Jewish antisemitism is "legitimate in principle", he adds that the growing literature in this field "exceeds all reason"; the attacks are often vitriolic, and encompass views that are not inherently anti-Zionist.

Lerman argues that this redefinition has had unfortunate repercussions. He writes that serious scholarly research into contemporary antisemitism has become "virtually non-existent", and that the subject is now most frequently studied and analyzed by "people lacking any serious expertise in the subject, whose principal aim is to excoriate Jewish critics of Israel and to promote the "anti-Zionism = anti-Semitism" equation. Lerman concludes that this redefinition has ultimately served to stifle legitimate discussion, and that it cannot create a basis on which to fight antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1020490.html Antony Lerman, "Jews attacking Jews"], ''Ha'aretz'', 12 September 2008, accessed 13 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Beaumont, writing in ''[[The Observer]]'', agrees that proponents of the concept of "new antisemitism" have attempted to co-opt anti-Jewish sentiment and attacks by some European Muslims as a way to silence opposition to the policies of the Israeli government. "[C]riticise Israel," he writes, "and you are an anti-Semite just as surely as if you were throwing paint at a [[synagogue]] in [[Paris]]."&lt;ref name=beaumont&gt;Beaumont, Peter.

=== Europe ===
The European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC) (superseded in 2007 by the [[Fundamental Rights Agency]]) noted an upswing in antisemitic incidents in France, Germany, Austria, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Belgium, and The Netherlands between July 2003 and December 2004.&lt;ref name=State&gt;"(U.S.) State Department report on Anti-Semitism: Europe and Eurasia" excerpted from a longer piece, and covering the period of July 1, 2003 – December 15, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2004, the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, a part of the [[Council of Europe]], called on its member nations to ensure that anti-racist criminal law covers antisemitism, and in 2005, the EUMC offered a discussion paper on a [[EUMC Working Definition of Antisemitism|working definition of antisemitism]] in an attempt to enable a standard definition to be used for data collection:&lt;ref&gt;Whine, Michael. [http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-041-whine.htm "Progress in the Struggle Against Anti-Semitism in Europe: The Berlin Declaration and the European Union Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia's Working Definition of Anti-Semitism"], ''Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism'', Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, February 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It defined antisemitism as "a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred towards Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed towards Jews and non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, towards Jewish community institutions and religious facilities." The paper's “Examples of the ways in which anti-Semitism manifests itself with regard to the state of Israel taking into account the overall context could include":
* Denying the Jewish people the right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor;
* Applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation;
* Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g. claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis;
* Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.
* Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the State of Israel.&lt;ref name=workingdef&gt;[http://fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/material/pub/AS/AS-WorkingDefinition-draft.pdf tp://eumc.eu.int/eumc/material/pub/AS/AS-WorkingDefinition-draft.pdf "Working definition of antisemitism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125001633/http://fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/material/pub/AS/AS-WorkingDefinition-draft.pdf |date=2011-01-25 }}, EUMC.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Working Definition of Antisemitism |url=http://fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/material/pub/AS/AS-WorkingDefinition-draft.pdf |publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights |access-date=23 July 2017 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5mYZH56QA?url=http://fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/material/pub/AS/AS-WorkingDefinition-draft.pdf |archive-date=5 January 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EUMC added that criticism of Israel cannot be regarded as antisemitism so long as it is "similar to that leveled against any other country."&lt;ref name=workingdef /&gt;

==== France ====
In France, Interior Minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] commissioned a report on racism and antisemitism from [[Jean-Christophe Rufin]], president of [[Action Against Hunger]] and former vice-president of [[Médecins Sans Frontières]], in which Rufin challenges the perception that the new antisemitism in France comes exclusively from [[North Africa]]n immigrant communities and the [[far right]].&lt;ref name=BBCnas&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3759834.stm "French concern about race attacks"], BBC News, October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=statefrance&gt;[https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51552.htm "France: International Religious Freedom Report 2005"], U.S. Department of State.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporting in October 2004, Rufin writes that "[t]he new anti-Semitism appears more heterogeneous," and identifies what he calls a new and "subtle" form of antisemitism in "radical anti-Zionism" as expressed by far-left and anti-globalization groups, in which criticism of Jews and Israel is used as a pretext to "legitimize the armed Palestinian conflict."&lt;ref name=Rufin&gt;[[Jean-Christophe Rufin|Rufin, Jean-Christophe]].

==== United Kingdom ====
In June 2011, Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom,  [[Jonathan Sacks]] (Lord Sacks), said that the basis for the new antisemitism was the 2001 [[Durban Conference]]. Rabbi Sacks also said that the new antisemitism "unites radical Islamists with human-rights NGOs—the right wing and the left wing—against a common enemy, the State of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/at_home_abroad/item/uk_chief_rabbi_jonathan_sacks_the_new_anti-semitism_is_a_virus_20110622/|title=UK Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks: "The New Anti-Semitism is a Virus"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, the [[All-Party Parliamentary Group against Anti-Semitism]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]] published the Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism, the result of an investigation into whether the belief that the "prevailing opinion both within the Jewish community and beyond" that antisemitism had "receded to the point that it existed only on the margins of society." was correct. It concluded that "the evidence we received indicates that there has been a reversal of this progress since the year 2000". In defining antisemitism, the Group wrote that it took into account the view of racism expressed by the MacPherson report, which was published after the murder of [[Stephen Lawrence]], that, for the purpose of investigating and recording complaints of crime by the police, an act must be recorded by the police as racist if it is defined as such by its victim. It formed the view that, broadly, "any remark, insult or act the purpose or effect of which is to violate a Jewish person's dignity or create an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for him is antisemitic" and concluded that, given that, "it is the Jewish community itself that is best qualified to determine what does and does not constitute antisemitism."&lt;ref name=APP1&gt;[http://www.antisemitism.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/All-Party-Parliamentary-Inquiry-into-Antisemitism-REPORT.pdf "Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822190807/http://www.antisemitism.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/All-Party-Parliamentary-Inquiry-into-Antisemitism-REPORT.pdf |date=2013-08-22 }}, September 2006, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The report states that some left-wing activists and Muslim extremists are using criticism of Israel as a "pretext" for antisemitism,&lt;ref name=Temko&gt;Temko, Ned.

Having re-defined Zionism, the report states, traditional antisemitic motifs of Jewish "conspiratorial power, manipulation and subversion" are often transferred from Jews onto Zionism. The report notes that this is "at the core of the 'New Antisemitism', on which so much has been written," adding that many of those who gave evidence called anti-Zionism "the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of antisemitic movements."&lt;ref name=APP22&gt;[http://www.antisemitism.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/All-Party-Parliamentary-Inquiry-into-Antisemitism-REPORT.pdf "Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822190807/http://www.antisemitism.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/All-Party-Parliamentary-Inquiry-into-Antisemitism-REPORT.pdf |date=2013-08-22 }}, September 2006, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israel ===
In November 2001, in response to an Abu-Dhabi television broadcast depicting [[Ariel Sharon]] drinking the blood of Palestinian children, the [[Politics of Israel|Israeli government]] set up the "Coordinating Forum for Countering Antisemitism", headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Rabbi [[Michael Melchior]]. According to Melchior, "in each and every generation antisemitism tries to hide its ugly face behind various disguises — and hatred of the State of Israel is its current disguise." He added that, "hate against Israel has crossed the red line, having gone from criticism to unbridled antisemitic venom, which is a precise translation of classical antisemitism whose past results are all too familiar to the entire world."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20200812130403/https://antisemitism.org.il/frontend/english/viewarticle.asp?id=7952&amp;itemtype=2 Announcement by the Forum], November 18, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anne Bayefsky]], a Canadian legal scholar who addressed the UN about its treatment of Israel, argues that the UN hijacks the language of human rights to discriminate and demonize Jews. She writes that over one quarter of the resolutions condemning a state's human rights violations have been directed at Israel. "But there has never been a single resolution about the decades-long repression of the civil and political rights of 1.3 billion people in [[China]], or the million female migrant workers in [[Saudi Arabia]] kept as virtual slaves, or the virulent racism which has brought 600,000 people to the brink of starvation in [[Zimbabwe]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne Bayefsky|Bayefsky, Anne]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;Motives for criticizing Israel in the UN may stem from legitimate concerns over policy or from illegitimate prejudices. ... However, regardless of the intent, disproportionate criticism of Israel as barbaric and unprincipled, and corresponding discriminatory measures adopted in the UN against Israel, have the effect of causing audiences to associate negative attributes with Jews in general, thus fueling anti-Semitism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== United States ===
The U.S. State Department's 2004 ''Report on Global Anti-Semitism'' identified four sources of rising antisemitism, particularly in Europe:
* "Traditional anti-Jewish prejudice... This includes ultra-nationalists and others who assert that the Jewish community controls governments, the media, international business, and the financial world."
* "Strong anti-Israel sentiment that crosses the line between objective criticism of Israeli policies and anti-Semitism."
* "Anti-Jewish sentiment expressed by some in Europe's growing Muslim population, based on longstanding antipathy toward both Israel and Jews, as well as Muslim opposition to developments in Israel and the occupied territories, and more recently in Iraq."
* "Criticism of both the United States and globalization that spills over to Israel, and to Jews in general who are identified with both."&lt;ref name=State /&gt;

In July 2006, the [[U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] issued a Campus Antisemitism report that declared that "Anti-Semitic bigotry is no less morally deplorable when camouflaged as anti-Israelism or anti-Zionism."&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Campus Anti-Semitism (2006) at 72.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the Commission also announced that antisemitism is a "serious problem" on many campuses throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, [[Yale University]] announced that it had established [[the Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Anti-Semitism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://isgap.org/|title=ISGAP|website=isgap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first university-based institute in North America dedicated to the study of antisemitism. Charles Small, head of the institute, said in a press release that antisemitism has "reemerged internationally in a manner that many leading scholars and policy makers take seriously ... Increasingly, Jewish communities around the world feel under threat. It's almost like going back into the lab. I think we need to understand the current manifestation of this disease."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/19/america/NA_GEN_US_Yale_Anti_Semitism.php "Yale Creates Center to Study Antisemitism"], ''Associated Press'', September 19, 2006; also see [[Edward H.

== Anti-globalization movement ==
The anti-globalization movement of the late 1990s and early 2000s was accused by writers and researchers such as [[Walter Laqueur]], [[Paul Berman]], and [[Mark Strauss (journalist)|Mark Strauss]] of displaying elements of New Antisemitism. Critics of {{clarify span|this view|reason=Antecedent of 'this view' is unclear: presumably, the Laqueur-Berman-Strauss view is meant. |date=July 2021}} argue that the allegation is either unfounded or exaggerated, intended to discredit legitimate [[criticism of globalization]] and of [[free trade]] economic policies.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

=== Mark Strauss's allegations ===
[[Mark Strauss (journalist)|Mark Strauss]] of ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' argues that globalization has stirred anxieties about "outside forces," and that with "familiar anxieties come familiar scapegoats."&lt;ref name=Strauss&gt;[[Mark Strauss (journalist)|Strauss, Mark]]. [http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/antiglobalisms-jewish-problem "Antiglobalism's Jewish Problem"], ''Foreign Policy'', November 12, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that what he calls the "backlash against globalization" has united a variety of political elements, from the left to the far-right, via a common cause, and that in so doing, it has "foster[ed] a common enemy." He quotes the French Jewish leader Roger Cukierman who identifies the [[anti-globalization movement]] as "an anti-Semitic brown-green-red alliance," which includes ultra-nationalists, the green movement, and communists.&lt;ref name=Strauss /&gt;

Strauss cites [[Jörg Haider]] of Austria's far-right [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]] and [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] of France's [[National Front (France)|Front national]] as examples of the far right exploiting their electorate's concerns about globalization. The ''[[Movimento Fascismo e Liberta]]'' in Italy identifies globalization as an "instrument in the hands of international Zionism," according to Strauss, while in Eastern Europe, ultranationalists and communists have united against foreign investors and multinationals, identifying Jews as a common enemy.&lt;ref name=Strauss /&gt;

American [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] [[Matthew F. Hale]] of the [[Creativity Movement|World Church of the Creator]] stated of the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|1999 protests]] against the [[World Trade Organization]] in [[Seattle]] that they were "incredibly successful from the point of view of the rioters as well as our Church. They helped shut down talks of the Jew World Order WTO and helped make a mockery of the [[Zionist Occupation Government|Jewish Occupational Government]] around the world. Bravo."&lt;ref name=Strauss /&gt; Strauss also cites the [[neo-Nazi]] [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]], which set up a website called the ''Anti-Globalism Action Network'' in order to "broaden [...] the anti-globalism movement to include divergent and marginalized voices."&lt;ref name=Strauss /&gt;

Strauss writes that, as a result of far-right involvement, a "bizarre ideological turf war has broken out," whereby anti-globalization activists are fighting a "two-front battle," one against the [[World Trade Organization]], [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), and [[World Bank]], the other against the extremists who turn up at their rallies.&lt;ref name=Strauss /&gt; He points to an anti-globalization march in [[Porto Alegre]], [[Brazil]] at which he says some marchers displayed [[Swastika]]s and that Jewish peace activists were assaulted.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Held two months prior to the U.S.-led attack on Iraq, this year's conference — an annual grassroots riposte to the well-heeled World Economic Forum in Davos — had the theme, "Another World is Possible." But the more appropriate theme might have been "Yesterday's World is Back." Marchers among the 20,000 activists from 120 countries carried signs reading "Nazis, Yankees, and Jews: No More Chosen Peoples!" Some wore T-shirts with the [[Star of David]] twisted into Nazi swastikas. Members of a Palestinian organization pilloried Jews as the "true fundamentalists who control United States capitalism." Jewish delegates carrying banners declaring "Two peoples – Two states: Peace in the Middle East" were assaulted.&lt;ref name=Strauss /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Strauss argues that the anti-globalization movement isn't itself antisemitic, but that it "helps enable anti-Semitism by peddling conspiracy theories."&lt;ref name=Strauss /&gt;

Strauss's arguments have been met with strong criticism from many in the anti-globalization movement. Oded Grajew, one of the founders of the [[World Social Forum]], has written that the WSF "is not anti-Semitic, anti-American, or even anti-socially-responsible capitalism". He claims that some fringe parties have attempted to infiltrate the WSF's demonstrations and promote demonstrations of their own, but adds that "[t]he success of the WSF [...] is a threat to political extremist groups that resort to violence and hatred". Grajew has also written that, to his knowledge, Strauss's claim of Nazi symbols being displayed at an anti-globalization demonstration in Porto Alegre, Brazil is false.&lt;ref&gt;Oded Grajew, "Debating Anti-Semitism" [letter], ''Foreign Policy'', 1 March 2004, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Response to Strauss ===
[[Maude Barlow]], national chairperson of the [[Council of Canadians]], argues that Strauss has "inflamed, not enlightened" the debate over globalization by making "no distinction between the far right's critique of globalization and that of the global social justice movement", which is premised on "respect for human rights and cultural diversity". She notes that the Council of Canadians has condemned antisemitism, and that it expelled some individuals who tried to organize a [[David Icke]] tour under its auspices.&lt;ref&gt;Maude Barlow, "Debating Anti-Semitism" [letter], ''Foreign Policy'', 1 March 2004, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; John Cavanagh of the International Policy Centre has also criticized Strauss for using unproven allegations of antisemitism to criticize the entire anti-globalization movement, and for failing to research the movement's core beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;John Cavanagh, "Debating Anti-Semitism" [letter], ''Foreign Policy'', 1 March 2004, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these criticisms, Strauss has written that antisemitic views "might not reflect the core values of the [[Global Justice Movement]] or its leading figures, yet they are facts of life in an amorphous, grassroots movement where any number of individuals or organizations express their opinions or seek to set the agenda". He has also reiterated his concern that "anti-capitalist rhetoric provides intellectual fodder for far right groups".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Strauss, "Debating Anti-Semitism" [letter], ''Foreign Policy'', 1 March 2004, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Laqueur]] describes this phenomenon:&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Laqueur]] (2006): ''The Changing Face of Anti-Semitism: From Ancient Times to the Present Day''. Oxford University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-530429-2}} p.186&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Although traditional Trotskyite ideology is in no way close to radical Islamic teachings and the shariah, since the radical Islamists also subscribed to anticapitalism, antiglobalism, and anti-Americanism, there seemed to be sufficient common ground for an alliance. Thus, the militants of the far left began to march side by side with the radical Islamists in demonstrations, denouncing American aggression and Israeli crimes. ... And it was only natural that in protest demonstrations militants from the far right would join in, antisemitic banners would be displayed, anti-Jewish literature such as the ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Protocols]]'' would be sold. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Lawrence Summers]], then president of Harvard University, also stated that "[s]erious and thoughtful people are advocating and taking actions that are anti-Semitic in their effect if not their intent. For example ... [a]t the same rallies where protesters, many of them university students, condemn the IMF and global capitalism and raise questions about globalization, it is becoming increasingly common to also lash out at Israel. Indeed, at the anti-IMF rallies last spring, chants were heard equating [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[Ariel Sharon|Sharon]]."&lt;ref name=Summers&gt;[[Lawrence Summers|Summers, Lawrence]].

A March 2003 report on antisemitism in the [[European Union]] by [[Werner Bergmann]] and [[Juliane Wetzel]] of the [[Berlin Research Centre on Anti-Semitism]] identifies anti-globalization rallies as one of the sources of antisemitism on the left.&lt;ref&gt;Bergmann, Werner &amp; Wetzel, Juliane.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the extreme left-wing scene, anti-Semitic remarks were to be found mainly in the context of pro-Palestinian and anti-globalisation rallies and in newspaper articles using anti-Semitic stereotypes in their criticism of Israel. Often this generated a combination of anti-Zionist and anti-American views that formed an important element in the emergence of an anti-Semitic mood in Europe.&lt;ref name=Bergmann /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Michael Kozak, then U.S. Acting Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, told reporters in 2005 that people within the anti-globalization movement have conflated their legitimate concerns "with this idea that Jews run the world and globalization is the fault of Jews."&lt;ref name=Kozak&gt;[https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/spbr/40347.htm "Global Anti-Semitism Report"], U.S. Department of State, January 5, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He said:&lt;ref name="Kozak" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I think one of the disturbing things is that you're starting to see this in some — you know, it's not just sort of right-wing ultranationalist skinhead types. It's now you're getting some fairly otherwise respectable intellectuals that are left of center who are anti-globalization who are starting to let this stuff creep into their rhetoric.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;And that's disturbing because it starts to — it starts to take what is a legitimate issue for debate, anti-globalization or the war in Iraq or any other issue, and when you start turning that into an excuse for saying therefore we should hate Jews, that's where you cross the line, in my view. It's not that you're not entitled to question all those other issues. Of course, those are fair game. But it's the same as saying, you know, you start hating all Muslims because of some policy you don't like by one Muslim country or something.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Robert S. Wistrich|Robert Wistrich]], Professor of European and Jewish History at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], told [[Manfred Gerstenfeld]] that globalization has given rise to an [[Anti-globalization movement|anti-globalist]] left that is "viscerally anti-American, anti-capitalist, and hostile to world Jewry."&lt;ref name=Wistrich&gt;[[Manfred Gerstenfeld|Gerstenfeld, Manfred]].

As an example of the alleged [[conflation]] of globalization, the U.S. and Israel, [[Josef Joffe]], editor and publisher of ''[[Die Zeit]]'' and adjunct professor at [[Stanford University]], cited [[José Bové]], a French anti-globalization activist and leader of the ''Confédération Paysanne''.&lt;ref name=RothFrance&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2002-3/france.htm "France"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119110757/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2002-3/france.htm |date=2012-11-19 }}, The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Antisemitism and Racism, Tel Aviv University, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Bové led what Joffe calls a "deconstructionist mob" against [[McDonald's]] to protest against its effects on French cuisine, later turning up in [[Ramallah]] to denounce Israel and announce his support for [[Yasser Arafat]].

Like Jews, Americans are money-grubbers who know only the value of money, and the worth of nothing. Like Jews, they seek to reduce all relationships to exchange and money. Like them, Americans are motivated only by profit, and so they respect no tradition."&lt;ref name=Joffe12&gt;[[Josef Joffe|Joffe, Josef]].

[[David Clark, Baron Clark of Windermere|David Clark]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', argues against this that "instances of anti-capitalism spilling into 'rich Jew' bigotry are ... well documented" but "stand out precisely because they conflict so sharply with the Left's universalism and its opposition to ethnic discrimination".&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;[[David Clark, Baron Clark of Windermere|Clark, David]].

In early 2004, [[Kalle Lasn]], author of "Culture Jam" and founder of ''[[Adbusters]]'', two influential and widely read anti-globalization texts, generated controversy when he wrote an editorial entitled "Why won't anyone say they are Jewish?".&lt;ref name=Lasn&gt;[[Kalle Lasn|Lasn, Kalle]].

Anyone who does so can count on automatically being smeared as an anti-Semite. But the point is not that Jews (who make up less than 2 percent of the American population) have a monolithic perspective. Indeed, American Jews overwhelmingly vote Democrat and many of them disagree strongly with Ariel Sharon's policies and Bush's aggression in Iraq. The point is simply that the neocons seem to have a special affinity for Israel that influences their political thinking and consequently American foreign policy in the Middle East."&lt;ref name=Lasn /&gt; The editorial suggested that Jews represent a disproportionately high percentage of the [[Neoconservatism|neo-conservatives]] who control American foreign policy, and that this may affect policy with respect to Israel.&lt;ref name="Raynes=Goldie"&gt;Raynes-Goldie, Kate.

Lasn was criticized by a number of anti-globalization activists. Klaus Jahn, professor of the philosophy of history at the [[University of Toronto]] condemned Lasn's article stating "Whether listing physicians who perform abortions in [[anti-abortion]] tracts, gays and lesbians in office memos, Communists in government and the entertainment industry [[McCarthyism|under McCarthy]], Jews in Central Europe under Nazism and so on, such list-making has always produced pernicious consequences."&lt;ref name=RaynesGoldie&gt;Raynes-Goldie, Kate, "[http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2004-03-18/news_story6.php Race baiting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018003106/http://nowtoronto.com/issues/2004-03-18/news_story6.php |date=2007-10-18 }}", ''[[Now (newspaper)|Now Magazine]]'', March 18024, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Meredith Warren, a Montreal anti-globalization activist responded to the article by saying "The U.S. government has only an economic interest in having control over that region. It wants oil and stability – it has nothing to do with Jews or Judaism. Pointing out the various religious stances of those in power totally misses the point of the U.S. government's interest in Israel."&lt;ref name=RaynesGoldie /&gt;

=== Controversy over alleged antisemitism within the French movement ===
{{See also|Red–green–brown alliance}}
According to a report by the [[Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Antisemitism]], a major event for the anti-globalization movement in France was the European Social Forum (ESF) in Paris in November 2003. The organizers allegedly included a number of Islamic groups, such as ''Présence Musulmane'', ''Secours Islamique'', and ''Collectif des Musulmans de France''. [[Tariq Ramadan]], the grandson of [[Hassan al-Banna]], the Egyptian founder of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], also attended meetings. A few weeks earlier, Ramadan had published a controversial article on a website — after ''Le Monde'' and ''Le Figaro'' refused to publish it — criticizing several French intellectuals, who according to the Institute, were either Jewish or "others he mistakenly thought were Jewish," for having "supposedly betrayed their universalist beliefs in favor of unconditional support for Zionism and Israel."&lt;ref name=RothFrance /&gt;

[[Bernard-Henri Lévy]], one of the intellectuals who was criticized, called on the French anti-globalization movement to distance itself from Ramadan. In an interview with ''Le Monde'', Lévy said: "Mr. Ramadan, dear anti-globalizationist friends, is not and cannot be one of yours. ... I call you on you quickly to distance yourselves from this character who, in crediting the idea of an elitist conspiracy under the control of Zionism, is only inflaming people's thoughts and opening the way to the worst."&lt;ref name=Monnot&gt;Monnot, Caroline &amp; Ternisien, Xavier. Caroline Monnot and Xavier Ternisien. [http://watch.windsofchange.net/themes_67.htm "Tariq Ramadan accusé d'antisémitisme"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005200850/http://watch.windsofchange.net/themes_67.htm |date=2008-10-05 }}, ''Le Monde'', October 10, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Le Monde'' reported that many members of the anti-globalization movement in France agreed that Ramadan's article "has no place on a European Social Forum mailing list."&lt;ref name=Monnot /&gt;

Other activists defended Ramadan. One activist told the newspaper that "[o]ne of the characteristics of the European Social Forum is the stark rise in immigrant and Muslim organizations. It is an important phenomenon and a positive one in many ways."&lt;ref name=Monnot /&gt; Another activist, Peter Khalfa, said: "Ramadan's essay is not anti-Semitic. It is dangerous to wave the red flag of anti-Semitism at any moment. However, it is a text marked partly by Ramadan's communitarian thought and which communicates his view of the world to others."&lt;ref name=Monnot /&gt; One of the leaders of the anti-globalization movement in France, José Bové of the ''Confédération Paysanne'', told ''Le Monde'': "The anti-globalization movement defends universalist points of view which are therefore necessarily secular in their political expression. That there should be people of different cultures and religions is only natural. The whole effort is to escape such determinisms."&lt;ref name=Monnot /&gt;

=== Concern within the political left ===
One of the protagonists of the anti-globalization movement, the Jewish Canadian writer and activist [[Naomi Klein]], has written of her concern at finding antisemitic rhetoric on some activist websites that she had visited: "I couldn't help thinking about all the recent events I've been to where [[Islamophobia|anti-Muslim]] violence was rightly condemned, but no mention was made of attacks on Jewish synagogues, cemeteries, and community centers."&lt;ref name=Klein&gt;[[Naomi Klein|Klein, Naomi]]. [http://www.inthesetimes.com/issue/26/13/feature2.shtml "Sharon's Best Weapon: The left must confront anti-Semitism head-on"], ''In These Times'', April 26, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Klein urged activists to confront antisemitism as part of their work for social justice. She also suggested that allegations of antisemitism can be often politically motivated, and that activists should avoid political simplifications that could be perceived as antisemitic:&lt;ref name="Klein" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The [anti-]globalization movement isn't anti-Semitic, it just hasn't fully confronted the implications of diving into the [[Middle East]] conflict. Most people on the left are simply choosing sides. In the Middle East, where one side is under occupation and the other has the U.S. military behind it, the choice seems clear. But it is possible to criticize Israel while forcefully condemning the rise of anti-Semitism. And it is equally possible to be pro-Palestinian independence without adopting a simplistic pro-Palestinian/anti-Israel dichotomy, a mirror image of the [[good versus evil]] equations so beloved by President [[George W. Bush]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In October 2004, the ''[[New Internationalist]]'' magazine published a special issue covering the insertion of antisemitic rhetoric into some progressive debates.&lt;ref name=internationalist&gt;[http://www.newint.org/issue372/index.htm "Judeophobia"], ''New Internationalist'', October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Ma'anit wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Adam Ma’anit, [http://newint.org/features/2004/10/01/keynote/ "A human balance," ''New Internationalist'', October 2004, #372.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502022403/http://newint.org/features/2004/10/01/keynote/ |date=2015-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Take Adbusters magazine's founder Kalle Lasn's recent editorial rant against Jewish neoconservatives....The article includes a self-selected 'well-researched list' of 50 of the supposedly most influential 'neocons' with little black dots next to all those who are Jewish....If it's not the neocons then it's the all-powerful 'Jewish lobby' which holds governments to ransom all over the world (because Jews control the global economy of course) to do their bidding. Meanwhile, rightwing Judeophobes often talk of a leftist Jewish conspiracy to promote equality and human rights through a new internationalism embodied in the UN in order to control governments and suppress national sovereignty. They call it the 'New World Order' or the 'Jew World Order'. They make similar lists to Lasn's of prominent Jews in the global justice movement (Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein, etc.) to argue their case.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The issue observes, however, that "While antisemitism is rife in the Arab World, the Israeli Government often uses it as moral justification for its policies."&lt;ref&gt;Asma Agbarieh, [http://newint.org/features/2004/10/01/arab-antisemitism/ "Spreading the Stain,"] ''New Internationalist'', October 2004, #372.&lt;/ref&gt;
