Scholar Ann Douglas chronicled the rise of what she describes as sentimental "feminization" of American mass culture in the 19th century, in which writers of both sexes underscored popular convictions about women's weaknesses, desires, and proper place in the world. &lt;ref name="douglas"&gt;Ann Douglas (1977). ''The Feminization of American Culture''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux ISBN 0-374-52558-7&lt;/ref&gt; Such a figurative societal shift has also been remarked upon in more modern times. &lt;ref name="neutopia"&gt;Doctress Neutopia (1994).
