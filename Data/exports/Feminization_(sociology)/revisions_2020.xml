== Definition of feminization ==
Feminization has two basic meanings. The first concerns a person who was not initially feminine but becomes feminine later in their life through the perceptions of both the individual and those around them. According to gender theorist [[Judith Butler]], a person's gender is not solely an act of will or self-description, as it is also shaped by the people who describe, categorize, and treat the person according to their own perceptions of their gender. The second meaning of the term feminization describes when a person who originally had feminine qualities begins to incorporate more feminine attributes into their personality in some way, shape, or form. The term has often been used to describe females, however over time it shifted to where the term can be used to describe the process of someone or something becoming more feminine by adopting feminine qualities.&lt;ref name="Myth"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Imhoff | first = Sarah | title = The myth of American Jewish feminization | journal = Jewish Social Studies | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 126&amp;ndash;152 | publisher = [[Indiana University Press]] | doi = 10.2979/jewisocistud.21.3.05 | jstor = 10.2979/jewisocistud.21.3.05 | date = Spring–Summer 2016 | url = https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/21871/The%20Myth%20of%20American%20Jewish%20Feminization.pdf?sequence=1 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminization of poverty ==
{{Main|Feminization of poverty}}
Women are more likely than men to live below the poverty line, a phenomenon known as the feminization of poverty. The 2015 poverty rates for men and women in the U.S. were 10% and 15% respectively. Women are less likely to pursue advanced degrees  and tend to have low paying jobs. It has been argued that there is a [[gender pay gap]]: even with the same level of education and occupational role, women earn much less than men,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/followup/session/presskit/fs1.htm|title=Beijing +5 – Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development and Peace for the 21st Century Twenty-third special session of the General Assembly, 5-9 June 2000|website=www.un.org|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; whether due to discrimination or to differences in choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/harvard-prof.-takes-down-gender-wage-gap-myth/article/2580405|title=Harvard prof. takes down gender wage gap myth|last=Schow|first=Ashe|website=The Washington Examiner|date=January 13, 2016|accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
