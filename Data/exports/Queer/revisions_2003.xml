'''Queer''' is an inclusive term for people of a minority [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]], such as [[gay]] men, [[lesbian]]s, [[bisexual]]s, and [[transgender]] people. In this usage, it is usually a synonym of such terms as LGBT or [[lesbigay]]. Often, it carries the connotation of being oppressed merely for being who they are, and of including anyone who transgresses [[heteronormativity]].

The term is often uppercased when referring to an identity or community, rather than merely a sexual fact (compare the capitalized use of [[Deaf]]).

Historically, the term was an epithet for gay men, bordering on [[profanity]]. Since the term originated, and in many circumstances persists, as a [[homophobia|homophobic]] slur, many members of sexual minorities do not favour its use. On the other hand, many people identify primarily as Queer rather than gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgendered.

The term first attained common usage during the [[1980s]], when it was popularized by the activist group [[Queer Nation]].

[[Queer studies]] as an academic discipline is now established at many universities.
