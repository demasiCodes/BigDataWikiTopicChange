'''Queer''' has traditionally meant 'strange' or 'unusual'.

'''Queer''' is currently often used in reference to [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], [[transgender]], and [[intersexuality|intersex]] communities. Its usage is [[controversy|controversial]] and underwent substantial changes over the course of the 20th century. The term is still considered by some to be offensive and derisive, and by others simply as a re-appropriated term used to describe a [[sexual orientation]] and/or [[gender identity]] or [[gender]] expression that does not conform to [[heteronormativity|heteronormative]] society.

Queer is still used to mean 'strange' or 'unusual' in many contexts, and in some areas its modern usage must clearly be indicated by the context for it to be understood with its newer meaning. 

==Traditional usage==
Since its emergence in the English language in the 16th century (related to the German ''quer'', meaning 'across, at right angle, diagonally or transverse'), ''queer'' has generally meant 'strange', 'unusual', or 'out of alignment'.  It might refer to something suspicious or 'not quite right', or to a person with mild insanity or who exhibits socially inappropriate behavior.  The expression 'in Queer Street' was used in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] as of the 1811 edition of [[Francis Grose]]'s ''[[A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue]]'' for someone in financial trouble.  It gained its implication of sexual deviance (especially that of homosexual and/or effeminate males) in the late 19th century; an early recorded usage of the word in this sense was in a letter by [[John Sholto Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry]] to his son [[Lord Alfred Douglas]].

Subsequently, for most of the 20th century, 'queer' was used primarily as a derogatory term for effeminate and/or gay males, and others exhibiting non-traditional gender behavior, with the more general meaning gradually falling into disuse.  During this transition, someone might use the term literally in the older sense, but implying the newer sense.  For example, 'He's a queer fellow,' would ostensibly be a statement that the man is a bit odd, but the subtext was that the speaker believed him to be gay (however this is not to say that, in transitional or even in contemporary usage, there always exists such a subtext whenever the word is used).

The term was also used disparagingly by people within the lesbian and gay communities during much of the 20th century. It might be self-applied as a form of self-deprecation, or it might be aimed at another—perhaps more stereotypically 'gay' or less conventional—gay man or lesbian woman, as an epithet, suggesting that the target is even 'lower' than the speaker. It might also be used to denigrate a peer by reminding him of his status in society: just a 'queer'.

==Contemporary usage==
In contemporary usage, some use ''queer'' as an inclusive, unifying sociopolitical [[umbrella term]] for people who are [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], and also for those who are [[transgender]], [[Transsexuality|transsexual]], [[intersexuality|intersexual]] and/or [[genderqueer]]. It can also include [[asexuality|asexual]] and [[Autosexuality|autosexual]] people, as well as [[heterosexuality|heterosexuals]] whose sexual preferences or activities place them outside the mainstream (e.g. [[BDSM]] practitioners, or [[polyamory|polyamorists]]). ''Queer'' in this sense (depending on how broadly it is defined) is commonly used as a synonym for such terms as [[LGBT]] or lesbigay. 

Many members of these communities have resisted this usage, and reject its application to them because the term — even as defined by modern activists — retains its connotation of 'strangeness'. Many gay and lesbian people do not consider themselves 'strange' and so consider the term '''''Queer''''' inappropriate or even offensive. Some object to being 'lumped in' with people whose sexuality they do not themselves condone (e.g. monogamous couples disapproving of what they perceive as sexually promiscuous radicals). Others simply object to embracing a term that persists as a [[homophobia|homophobic]] slur, often bordering on [[profanity]], which many—especially (but not exclusively) older individuals—still find personally hurtful.  Many transgender, transsexual, and intersexual people instead identify themselves as heterosexual or straight, rejecting 'queer' status. Some gay and lesbian people feel that embracing the word 'queer' means embracing a political agenda with which they do not agree. For example, while the fight for same-sex marriage rights is an important issue for many gay people, some perceive that 'queer activists' tend to treat it as a low priority, or even to reject the validity of the issue.

Because of the context in which it was reclaimed, ''queer'' has sociopolitical connotations, and is often preferred by those who are activists, by those who strongly reject traditional gender identities, by those who reject distinct [[sexual identity|sexual identities]] such as gay, lesbian, bisexual and straight, and by those who see themselves as oppressed by the [[heteronormativity]] of the larger culture. In this usage it retains the historical connotation of "outside the bounds of normal society" and can be construed as "breaking the rules for sex and gender." It can be preferred because of its ambiguity, which allows "queer" identifying people to avoid the sometimes strict boundaries that surround other labels. In this context "queer" is not a synonym for [[LGBT]] and many activist groups accept the acronym LGBTQ as preferable to the less inclusive [[LGBT]]. On the other hand, some people who identify comfortably with the terms Gay and Lesbian reject the word "queer" as narrow, political, and divisive.

Several television shows, including ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'', the cartoon ''[[Queer Duck]]'' and the [[Queer as Folk (UK TV series)|British]] and [[Queer as Folk (US TV series)|American]] versions of ''Queer as Folk'', have also used the term, in its positive self-identification sense, in their titles.

The term is sometimes capitalized when referring to an [[Identity (social science)|identity]] or community, rather than merely a sexual fact (cf. the capitalized use of [[Deaf]]).

==Queer events and groups==
''[[Queeruption]]'' is a queer festival which takes place in a different city each year. In the summers of [[2002]] and [[2006]], a festival was held in [[Olympia, Washington]] called ''[http://www.homoagogo.com Homo-a-go-go]'', which featured queer films, zines, performance and musical groups during the week-long event; another one is planned for [[2006]]. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] The "[[Queer Youth Alliance]]" hosts the annual National "Queer Youth Conference", a national gathering of several hundred LGBT young people from all over the country. A group of queercore bands toured throughout the U.S.; the tour was called [http://www.queercoreblitz.com/ Queercore Blitz] and was yet another way to connect the like-minded. ''[http://www.queerupnorth.com/ Queer Up North]'' - The UKs largest Queer arts festival held in Manchester every year since 1992 with three weeks of outstanding UK and International queer theatre, performance, comedy, music, dance, film, cabaret, clubbing and exhibitions.

Other smaller Queer Groups flourishing now in the UK are;

''[http://www.queeruption.org.uk/qwb.htm Queers Without Borders]'', a network of queer activists against border regimes and also try to support those oppressed by them.

''[http://queermutiny-north.da.ru Queer Mutiny North]'', a D-I-Y non-hierarchical collective that aims to create politically motivated queer alternatives to the commercial and non-representative gay scene in the north of [[England]].

''[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/cardiff_queer_mutiny/ Cardiff Queer Mutiny]'', A not-for-profit collective inspired by queer activism/philosophy, DIY punk ethics, creativity, [[Riot grrrl]] and political activist movements. ''(These groups put on much more regular activity but are smaller in size.)''
