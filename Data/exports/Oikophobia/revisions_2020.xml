'''Oikophobia''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{Lang-grc|{{wikt-lang|en|οἶκος|oîkos}}|label=none|lit=[[house]], [[household]]}} + {{Lang-grc|{{wikt-lang|en|phóbos|phóbos}}|label=none|lit=fear}}; also known as '''domatophobia''' and '''ecophobia''') is an aversion to a home environment, or an abnormal [[Fear processing in the brain|fear]] (''[[phobia]]'') of one's home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kahn|first1=Ada|title=The Encyclopedia of Phobias, Fears, and Anxieties|date=2010|publisher=|year=|isbn=|edition=3rd|location=|page=552|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[psychiatry]], the term is also more narrowly used to indicate a phobia of the contents of a house: "fear of [[Home appliance|household appliances]], [[Electrical equipment|equipment]], [[Bathtub|bathtubs]], [[household chemicals]], and other common objects in the home."&lt;ref name="ron"&gt;Doctor, Ronald Manual, Ada P. Kahn, and Christine A. Adamec. 2008. ''The Encyclopedia of Phobias, Fears, and Anxieties'' (3rd ed.). [[Infobase Publishing]]. pp. 281, 286.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, '''domatophobia''' specifically refers to the fear of a house itself.&lt;ref name="ron" /&gt; 

In 1808, [[poet]] and [[List of essayists|essayist]] [[Robert Southey]] used the word to describe a desire (particularly by the [[English people|English]]) to leave home and travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Southey|first=Robert|title=Letters from England, Volume 1|year=1808|publisher=David Longworth|url=https://archive.org/details/lettersfromengl06soutgoog|quote=Oikophobia.|authorlink=Robert Southey|page=[https://archive.org/details/lettersfromengl06soutgoog/page/n220 311]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southey's usage as a synonym for ''[[wanderlust]]'' was picked up by other 19th-century writers.

The term has been used in [[Politics|political]] contexts to refer critically to [[political ideologies]] that repudiate one's own culture and laud others. One prominent such usage was by [[Roger Scruton]] in his 2004 book ''England and the Need for Nations''.

==In psychiatry==
In [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] usage, ''oikophobia'' may narrowly refer to fear of the [[physical space]] of the home interior, where it is especially linked to the fear of [[household appliances]], [[Bathtub|baths]], [[electrical equipment]], and other aspects of the home perceived to be potentially dangerous.&lt;ref name = "ron"/&gt; In this psychiatric context, the term is properly applied to fear of the objects ''within the house'', whereas the fear of the ''house itself'' is referred to as '''domatophobia'''.&lt;ref name = "ron"/&gt; 

In the [[Aftermath of World War II|post-World War II]] era, some commentators used the term to refer to a supposed "fear and loathing of [[Homemaking|housework]]" experienced by women who worked outside of the home and who were attracted to a [[Consumerism|consumerist lifestyle]].&lt;ref&gt;Moeller, Robert G. 1993. ''Protecting motherhood: Women and the family in the politics of postwar West Germany''. [[University of California Press]]. p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Southey's usage==
In his ''Letters from England'' (1808), [[Robert Southey]] describes ''oikophobia'' as a product of "a certain state of [[Civilization|civilisation]] or luxury." referring to the habit among wealthy people to visit [[Spa town|spa towns]] and [[Seaside resort|seaside resorts]] in the summer months. He also mentions the fashion for [[picturesque]] travel to wild landscapes, such as the [[Scottish Highlands|highlands of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Southey|Southey, Robert]]. 1808. ''[[iarchive:lettersfromengl06soutgoog/|Letters from England]]'' 1. New York: David Longworth. pp. [[iarchive:lettersfromengl06soutgoog/page/n165/mode/2up|157]]–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Southey's link of oikophobia to wealth and the search for new experiences was taken up by other writers, and cited in [[Dictionary|dictionaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Black, Richard. 1874. ''The student's manual complete: an etymological vocabulary of words derived from the Greek and Latin''. Oxford. p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; A writer in 1829 published an essay about his experience witnessing the aftermath of the [[Battle of Waterloo]], saying:&lt;ref&gt;[Eyewitness]. 1829. "[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b2991723&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=102 Waterloo, the Day After the Battle]." Pp. 84–92 in ''The United Service Journal and Naval and Military Magazine'' 1. London: [[Henry Colburn]]. p. 84. Retrieved 3 July 2020.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he love of locomotion is so natural to an [[English people|Englishman]] that nothing can chain him home, but the absolute impossibility of living abroad. No such imperious necessity acting upon me, I gave away to my ''oiko-phobia'' and the summer of 1815 found me in Brussels.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 1959, Anglo-Egyptian author Bothaina Abd el-Hamid Mohamed used Southey's concept in his book ''Oikophobia: or, A literary craze for education through travel''.&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed, Bothaina Abd el-Hamid. 1959. ''Oikophobia;: Or, A literary craze for education through travel''. Anglo-Egyptian Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political usage ==
{{Discrimination sidebar|state=collapsed}}
In his 2004 book ''England and the Need for Nations'', [[British conservative]] philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] adapted the word to mean "the repudiation of inheritance and home."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Roger Scruton|Scruton, Roger]]. 2004. "[http://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/cs49-8.pdf Oikophobia]." pp. 33–38 in ''England and the Need for Nations''. London: [[Civitas (think tank)|Civitas]].&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that it is "a stage through which the [[adolescent]] mind normally passes,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.continuumbooks.com/authors/details.aspx?AuthorId=145104&amp;BookId=126311|title=Continuum - Political Philosophy &gt; Roger Scruton|last=Scruton|first=Roger|date=|publisher=Continuumbooks.com|accessdate=2010-08-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015184851/http://www.continuumbooks.com/authors/details.aspx?AuthorId=145104&amp;BookId=126311|archive-date=2009-10-15|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that it is a feature of some, typically [[leftist]], political impulses and ideologies that espouse [[xenophilia]], i.e. preference for foreign cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Scruton|Scruton, Roger]]. "Oikophobia and Xenophilia." pp. 287–92 in ''Stereotypes and Nations'', edited by T. Walas. Cracow International Cultural Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scruton uses the term as the [[antithesis]] of ''[[xenophobia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lacroix, Justine, and [[Kalypso Nicolaïdis|Kalypso Nicolaīdis]]. 2011. ''European Stories: Intellectual Debates on Europe in National Contexts''. [[Oxford University Press]]. p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''Roger Scruton: Philosopher on Dover Beach'', [[Mark Dooley]] describes ''oikophobia'' as centered within the Western [[Academy|academic establishment]] on "both the common [[Western culture|culture of the West]], and the old educational [[curriculum]] that sought to transmit its humane values." This disposition has grown out of, for example, the writings of [[Jacques Derrida]] and of [[Michel Foucault]]'s "assault on '[[bourgeois]]' society result[ing] in an '[[Counterculture|anti-culture]]' that took direct aim at holy and [[sacred]] things, condemning and repudiating them as [[oppressive]] and power-ridden."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[[Mark Dooley|Dooley, Mark]]. 2009. ''Roger Scruton: Philosopher on Dover Beach''. [[Continuum Books|Continuum]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|78}} He continues:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|83}}&lt;blockquote&gt;
Derrida is a classic oikophobe in so far as he repudiates the longing for home that the [[Western theology|Western theological]], [[Western law|legal]], and [[Western literature|literary]] traditions satisfy.… Derrida's [[deconstruction]] seeks to block the path to this 'core experience' of membership, preferring instead a rootless existence founded 'upon nothing.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;
An extreme aversion to the sacred, and the thwarting of the connection of the sacred to the culture of the West is described as the underlying [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] of oikophobia; and not the substitution of [[Judeo-Christianity]] by another coherent system of belief. The [[paradox]] of the '''oikophobe''' seems to be that any opposition directed at the [[Theology|theological]] and cultural [[tradition]] of the West is to be encouraged even if it is "significantly more [[parochial]], [[exclusivist]], [[patriarchal]], and [[ethnocentric]]."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|78}} Scruton describes "a chronic form of oikophobia [which] has spread through the [[American universities]], in the guise of [[political correctness]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|37}}

Scruton's usage has been taken up by some U.S. [[political commentators]] to refer to what they see as a rejection of traditional [[Culture of the United States|U.S. culture]] by the [[liberal elite]]. In August 2010, [[James Taranto]] wrote a column in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' entitled "Oikophobia: Why the liberal elite finds Americans revolting", in which he criticizes supporters of the proposed [[Park51|Islamic center in New York]] as oikophobes who were defending [[Muslims]] and aimed to "exploit the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 atrocity]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704147804575455523068802824|title=Oikophobia: Why the liberal elite finds Americans revolting|last=Taranto|first=James|date=27 August 2010|publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.]]|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|department=Best of the Web|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Netherlands]], the term ''oikophobia'' has been adopted by politician and writer [[Thierry Baudet]], which he describes in his book, ''Oikophobia: The Fear of Home''.
