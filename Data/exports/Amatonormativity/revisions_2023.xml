'''Amatonormativity''' is the set of societal assumptions that everyone prospers with an [[exclusive relationship|exclusive romantic relationship]]. [[Elizabeth Brake]] coined the [[neologism]] to capture societal assumptions about [[Romance (love)|romance]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |title=Do you feel under pressure to find The One? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zfjx6v4 |access-date=15 July 2020 |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2020 |archive-date=15 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200715002159/https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zfjx6v4 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TWA"&gt;{{cite news |author-last1=Bonos |author-first1=Lisa |title=Bugging your friend to get into a relationship?

Amatonormativity extends beyond social pressures for marriage to include general pressures involving romance.&lt;ref name="TWA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EBA"&gt;{{cite web |author-last1=Brake |author-first1=Elizabeth |title=Amatonormativity |url=https://elizabethbrake.com/amatonormativity/ |website=Elizabeth Drake |date=29 August 2017 |access-date=14 July 2020 |archive-date=22 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422045037/https://elizabethbrake.com/amatonormativity/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''amatonormativity'' comes from ''amatus'', which is the [[Latin]] word for "loved", and ''[[normativity]]'', referring to societal norms.&lt;ref name="TWP"&gt;{{cite news |author-last1=Baer |author-first1=Drake |title=There's a word for the assumption that everybody should be in a relationship |url=https://theweek.com/articles/688887/theres-word-assumption-that-everybody-should-relationship |access-date=14 July 2020 |publisher=The Week Publications Inc |date=31 March 2017 |archive-date=15 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200715125406/https://theweek.com/articles/688887/theres-word-assumption-that-everybody-should-relationship |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Another word which is similarly related to the word ''amatonormativity'' is ''amative''. [[Merriam-Webster dictionary]] defines the word ''amative'' as: strongly moved by love and especially sexual love. Relating to or indicative of love. ''Amorous'' is a closely related word also derived from ''amatus''.&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite web |title=Amative |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/amative |website=merriam-webster |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] dictionaries |access-date=14 July 2020 |archive-date=15 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200715073735/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/amative |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{original research inline|date=October 2021}} Related terms include ''[[allonormativity]]'', which means a worldview that assumes all people experience sexual and romantic attraction, and ''compulsory sexuality'', which means social norms and practices that marginalizes non-sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mollet |first1=Amanda L. |last2=Lackman |first2=Brian |chapter=Allonormativity and Compulsory Sexuality |title=Encyclopedia of Queer Studies in Education |date=24 January 2021 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-50672-5 |doi=10.1163/9789004506725_006 |chapter-url=https://brill.com/display/book/9789004506725/BP000013.xml |language=en |access-date=4 July 2023 |archive-date=21 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230321225531/https://brill.com/display/book/9789004506725/BP000013.xml |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was modeled after the term [[heteronormativity]], the belief that heterosexuality is the default for sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soloish/wp/2017/07/06/what-is-amatonormativity-the-belief-that-youre-always-better-off-in-a-romantic-relationship/|title=Bugging your friend to get into a relationship?

==Examples==
[[Elizabeth Brake]] describes the term as a pressure or desire for [[monogamy]], romance, and/or marriage.
The desire to find relationships that are romantic, sexual, monogamous, and lifelong has many social consequences. People who are [[Asexuality|asexual]], [[aromantic]], and/or [[nonmonogamy|nonmonogamous]] become social oddities. According to researcher Bella DePaulo, it puts a stigma on [[Single person|single people]] as incomplete and pushes romantic partners to stay in unhealthy relationships because of a fear the partners may have of being single.&lt;ref name="cut"&gt;{{cite web |title=There's a Word for the Assumption That Everybody Should Be in a Relationship |date=8 March 2017 |publisher=The Cut |url=https://www.thecut.com/2017/03/amatonormativity-everybody-should-be-coupled-up.html |access-date=2 March 2019 |archive-date=6 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306050618/https://www.thecut.com/2017/03/amatonormativity-everybody-should-be-coupled-up.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

According to Brake, one way in which amatonormativity is [[Institutional theory|institutionally]] applied is the law and morality surrounding marriage. [[Platonic love|Loving friendships]], [[queerplatonic]], and other relationships are not given the same legal protections romantic partners are given through marriage.&lt;ref name="psych"&gt;{{cite web |title=Should Marriage Be Abolished, Minimized, or Left Alone? |publisher=Psychology Today |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/living-single/201207/should-marriage-be-abolished-minimized-or-left-alone |access-date=2 March 2019 |archive-date=4 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230704225025/https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/living-single/201207/should-marriage-be-abolished-minimized-or-left-alone |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brake wrote a book, ''[[Minimizing Marriage]]'', in which she defines amatonormativity as "the widespread assumption that everyone is better off in an exclusive, romantic, long-term coupled relationship, and that everyone is seeking such a relationship."&lt;ref name="HP"&gt;{{cite news |author-last1=Sharpe |author-first1=Brianna |title=Why These Families Want To Queer Valentine's Day |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/valentines-day-gender_ca_5e444684c5b61b84d3440f4f |access-date=14 July 2020 |publisher=[[Huffington Post]] |date=12 February 2020 |archive-date=14 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200714234157/https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/valentines-day-gender_ca_5e444684c5b61b84d3440f4f |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
