===Surgical===

Up to 15 weeks' gestation, [[suction-aspiration abortion|suction-aspiration]] or vacuum aspiration are the most common surgical methods of induced abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Healthwise |url=http://www.webmd.com/hw/womens_conditions/tw1078.asp#tw1112 |title=Manual and vacuum aspiration for abortion |year=2004 |website=WebMD |access-date=5 December 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070211155626/http://www.webmd.com/hw/womens_conditions/tw1078.asp| archive-date=11 February 2007| url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Manual vacuum aspiration'' (MVA) consists of removing the [[fetus]] or [[embryo]], [[placenta]], and membranes by suction using a manual syringe, while ''electric vacuum aspiration'' (EVA) uses an electric pump. Both techniques can be used very early in pregnancy. MVA can be used up to 14 weeks but is more often used earlier in the U.S. EVA can be used later.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

MVA, also known as "mini-suction" and "[[menstrual extraction]]", or EVA can be used in very early pregnancy when cervical dilation may not be required. [[Dilation and curettage]] (D&amp;C) refers to opening the cervix (dilation) and removing tissue (curettage) via suction or sharp instruments. D&amp;C is a standard gynecological procedure performed for a variety of reasons, including examination of the uterine lining for possible malignancy, investigation of abnormal bleeding, and abortion. The [[World Health Organization]] recommends ''sharp curettage'' only when suction aspiration is unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Managing Complications in Pregnancy and Childbirth: A Guide for Midwives and Doctors| author=World Health Organization| publisher=World Health Organization| year=2017| isbn=978-92-4-154587-7| location=Geneva|  chapter=Dilatation and curettage| oclc=181845530| access-date=30 July 2019|chapter-url=https://www.who.int/reproductive-health/impac/Procedures/Dilatetion_P61_P63.html|archive-date=19 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519162903/http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/impac/Procedures/Dilatetion_P61_P63.html| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dilation and evacuation]] (D&amp;E), used after 12 to 16 weeks, consists of opening the [[cervix]] and emptying the uterus using surgical instruments and suction. D&amp;E is performed vaginally and does not require an incision. [[Intact dilation and extraction]] (D&amp;X) refers to a variant of D&amp;E sometimes used after 18 to 20 weeks when removal of an intact fetus improves surgical safety or for other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Dilation and evacuation.

Abortion may also be performed surgically by hysterotomy or gravid hysterectomy. [[Hysterotomy abortion]] is a procedure similar to a [[caesarean section]] and is performed under [[general anesthesia]]. It requires a smaller incision than a caesarean section and can be used during later stages of pregnancy. Gravid hysterectomy refers to removal of the whole uterus while still containing the pregnancy. Hysterotomy and hysterectomy are associated with much higher rates of maternal morbidity and mortality than D&amp;E or induction abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 135: Second-trimester abortion | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 121 | issue = 6 | pages = 1394–1406 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23812485 | doi = 10.1097/01.AOG.0000431056.79334.cc | s2cid = 205384119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labor induction abortion===
In places lacking the necessary medical skill for dilation and extraction, or when preferred by practitioners, an abortion can be induced by first [[Labor induction|inducing labor]] and then [[Late termination of pregnancy#Methods|inducing fetal demise]] if necessary.&lt;ref name=GLOWM_Late&gt;{{cite journal| last = Borgatta | first= Lynn |journal=Global Library of Women's Medicine| date=December 2014 |volume=GLOWM.10444| doi=10.3843/GLOWM.10444| url=http://www.glowm.com/section_view/heading/Labor%20Induction%20Termination%20of%20Pregnancy/item/443| access-date=25 September 2015| title=Labor Induction Termination of Pregnancy| url-status=live| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924082507/http://www.glowm.com/section_view/heading/Labor%20Induction%20Termination%20of%20Pregnancy/item/443| archive-date=24 September 2015| url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes called "induced miscarriage". This procedure may be performed from 13 weeks gestation to the third trimester. Although it is very uncommon in the United States, more than 80% of induced abortions throughout the second trimester are labor-induced abortions in Sweden and other nearby countries.&lt;ref name=Labor_Induced_Abortion&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Borgatta | first1= Lynn  |first2 =Nathalie |last2 =Kapp| title = Clinical guidelines. Labor induction abortion in the second trimester | journal = Contraception | volume = 84 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–18 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21664506 | doi = 10.1016/j.contraception.2011.02.005 | url = http://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(11)00057-6/pdf | access-date = 25 September 2015 | url-status = live | quote = 10. What is the effect of feticide on labor induction abortion outcome? Deliberately causing demise of the fetus before labor induction abortion is performed primarily to avoid transient fetal survival after expulsion; this approach may be for the comfort of both the woman and the staff, to avoid futile resuscitation efforts. Some providers allege that feticide also facilitates delivery, although little data support this claim. Transient fetal survival is very unlikely after intraamniotic installation of saline or urea, which are directly feticidal. Transient survival with misoprostol for labor induction abortion at greater than 18 weeks ranges from 0% to 50% and has been observed in up to 13% of abortions performed with high-dose oxytocin. Factors associated with a higher likelihood of transient fetal survival with labor induction abortion include increasing gestational age, decreasing abortion interval and the use of nonfeticidal inductive agents such as the PGE1 analogues. | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200606205318/https://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(11)00057-6/pdf | archive-date = 6 June 2020 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only limited data are available comparing labor-induced abortion with the dilation and extraction method.&lt;ref name=Labor_Induced_Abortion/&gt; Unlike D&amp;E, labor-induced abortions after 18 weeks may be complicated by the occurrence of brief fetal survival, which may be legally characterized as live birth. For this reason, labor-induced abortion is legally risky in the United States.&lt;ref name=Labor_Induced_Abortion/&gt;&lt;ref name=NAF_2015_Policy&gt;{{cite book| title=2015 Clinical Policy Guidelines| publisher=National Abortion Federation| date=2015| url=http://prochoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2015_NAF_CPGs.pdf| access-date=30 October 2015| quote=Policy Statement: Medical induction abortion is a safe and effective method for termination of pregnancies beyond the first trimester when performed by trained clinicians in medical offices, freestanding clinics, ambulatory surgery centers, and hospitals.

===Other methods===
Historically, a number of herbs reputed to possess abortifacient properties have been used in [[folk medicine]]. Such herbs include [[tansy]], [[Mentha pulegium|pennyroyal]], [[black cohosh]], and the now-extinct [[Silphium (antiquity)|silphium]].&lt;ref name="riddle2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Riddle |first=John M |url=https://archive.org/details/evesherbshistory0000ridd |title=Eve's herbs: a history of contraception and abortion in the West |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-674-27024-4 |location=Cambridge, MA |oclc=36126503 |author-link=John M. Riddle |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44–47, 62–63, 154–155, 230–231}}

In 1978, one woman in Colorado died and another developed organ damage when they attempted to terminate their pregnancies by taking pennyroyal oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sullivan JB, Rumack BH, Thomas H, Peterson RG, Bryson P | title = Pennyroyal oil poisoning and hepatotoxicity | journal = JAMA | volume = 242 | issue = 26 | pages = 2873–2874 | date = December 1979 | pmid = 513258 | doi = 10.1001/jama.1979.03300260043027 | s2cid = 26198529 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because the indiscriminant use of herbs as abortifacients can cause serious—even lethal—side effects, such as [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome|multiple organ failure]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ciganda C, Laborde A | title = Herbal infusions used for induced abortion | journal = Journal of Toxicology.

Abortion is sometimes attempted by causing trauma to the abdomen. The degree of force, if severe, can cause serious internal injuries without necessarily succeeding in inducing [[miscarriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith JP | title = Risky choices: the dangers of teens using self-induced abortion attempts | journal = Journal of Pediatric Health Care | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 147–151 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9652283 | doi = 10.1016/S0891-5245(98)90245-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Southeast Asia, there is an ancient tradition of attempting abortion through forceful abdominal massage.&lt;ref name="potts"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Potts M, Graff M, Taing J | title = Thousand-year-old depictions of massage abortion | journal = The Journal of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Care | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 233–234 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17925100 | doi = 10.1783/147118907782101904 | doi-access = free | author-link1 = Malcolm Potts }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the [[bas relief]]s decorating the temple of [[Angkor Wat]] in Cambodia depicts a demon performing such an abortion upon a woman who has been sent to the [[underworld]].&lt;ref name="potts" /&gt;

Reported methods of unsafe, [[self-induced abortion]] include misuse of [[misoprostol]] and insertion of non-surgical implements such as knitting needles and [[clothes hanger]]s into the uterus. These and other methods to terminate pregnancy may be called "induced miscarriage".

The researchers also stated: "These results add to the scientific evidence that emotions about an abortion are associated with personal and social context, and are not a product of the abortion procedure itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rocca CH, Samari G, Foster DG, Gould H, Kimport K | title = Emotions and decision rightness over five years following an abortion: An examination of decision difficulty and abortion stigma | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 248 | page = 112704 | date = March 2020 | pmid = 31941577 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.112704 | doi-access = free | quote=We found no evidence of emerging negative emotions or abortion decision regret; both positive and negative emotions declined over the first two years and plateaued thereafter, and decision rightness remained high and steady (predicted percent: 97.5% at baseline, 99.0% at five years). At five years postabortion, relief remained the most commonly felt emotion among all women (predicted mean on 0-4 scale: 1.0; 0.6 for sadness and guilt; 0.4 for regret, anger and happiness). Despite converging levels of emotions by decision difficulty and stigma level over time, these two factors remained most important for predicting negative emotions and decision non-rightness years later. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women seeking an abortion may use unsafe methods, especially when abortion is legally restricted. They may attempt [[self-induced abortion]] or seek the help of a person without proper medical training or facilities. This can lead to severe complications, such as incomplete abortion, [[sepsis]], hemorrhage, and damage to internal organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Okonofua F | title = Abortion and maternal mortality in the developing world | journal = Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada | volume = 28 | issue = 11 | pages = 974–979 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17169222 | doi = 10.1016/S1701-2163(16)32307-6 | url = http://www.jogc.org/abstracts/full/200611_WomensHealth_1.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120111121431/http://www.jogc.org/abstracts/full/200611_WomensHealth_1.pdf | archive-date = 11 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abortion rates vary depending on the stage of pregnancy and the method practiced. In 2003, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) reported that 26% of reported legal induced abortions in the United States were known to have been obtained at the end of 6 weeks of gestation or less, 18% at 7 weeks, 15% at 8 weeks, 18% at 9 through 10 weeks, 10% at 11 through 12 weeks, 6% at 13 through 15 weeks, 4% at 16 through 20 weeks and 1% at more than 21 weeks. 91% of these were classified as having been done by "[[curettage]]" ([[Suction-aspiration abortion|suction-aspiration]], [[dilation and curettage]], [[dilation and evacuation]]), 8% by "[[medical abortion|medical]]" means ([[mifepristone]]), &gt;1% by "[[instillation abortion|intrauterine instillation]]" (saline or [[prostaglandin]]), and 1% by "other" (including [[hysterotomy abortion|hysterotomy]] and [[hysterectomy]]).&lt;ref name="cdc2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Strauss LT, Gamble SB, Parker WY, Cook DA, Zane SB, Hamdan S | title = Abortion surveillance--United States, 2003 | journal = Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.

There are both medical and non-medical reasons to have an abortion later in pregnancy (after 20 weeks). A study was conducted from 2008 to 2010 at the University of California San Francisco where more than 440 women were asked about why they experienced delays in obtaining abortion care, if there were any. This study found that almost half of individuals who obtained an abortion after 20 weeks did not suspect that they were pregnant until later in their pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web |date=December 5, 2019 |title=Abortions Later in Pregnancy |url=https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/abortions-later-in-pregnancy/ |website=KFF (Kaiser Family Foundation) |access-date=10 November 2023 |archive-date=10 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231110191733/https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/abortions-later-in-pregnancy/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other barriers to abortion care found in the study included lack of information about where to access an abortion, difficulties with transportation, lack of insurance coverage, and inability to pay for the abortion procedure.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

===Societal===
Some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | veditors = Fried MG |title=From Privacy to Autonomy: The Conditions for Reproductive and Sexual Freedom | vauthors = Copelon R |author-link=Rhonda Copelon |encyclopedia=From Abortion to Reproductive Freedom: Transforming a Movement |date=1990 |publisher=South End Press |isbn=978-0-89608-387-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=keE5EmSKYr0C&amp;q=abortion%20poverty%20autonomy&amp;pg=PA38 |pages=27–43 |quote=The prevalence of economically influenced abortions and the sterilization campaigns against poor, minority, and disabled women show us that autonomy is impossible without eradication of discrimination and poverty.

These factors can sometimes result in compulsory abortion or [[sex-selective abortion]].&lt;ref name="MissingWomen"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oster E |author-link=Emily Oster |title=Explaining Asia's "Missing Women": A New Look at the Data |journal=Population and Development Review |date=September 2005 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=529–535 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4994961 |access-date=5 February 2019 |doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2005.00082.x |quote=Households have variously resorted to female infanticide and postnatal withholding of health care; and since the mid-1980s, when technology permitting fairly low-cost determination of the sex of fetuses became available, there has been a shift toward prenatal sex selection by means of induced abortion. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207131815/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4994961_Explaining_Asia%27s_Missing_Women_A_New_Look_at_the_Data |archive-date=7 February 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In cultures where there is a preference for male children, some women have sex selective abortions, which have partially replaced the earlier practice of female [[infanticide]].&lt;ref name="MissingWomen" /&gt;

=== Maternal health ===
Some abortions are performed due to concerns over [[maternal health]]. In 1990s, women cited maternal health as their main motivating factor in about a third of abortions in three of 27 countries analyzed. In seven additional countries, about 7% of abortions were maternal health related.&lt;ref name="guttmacher" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bankole98"/&gt;&lt;!-- Quote = Risk to maternal health. This reason was somewhat important overall, having been cited as the main reason by 5-10% in seven countries and by 20-38% in three (Kenya, Bangladesh and India). --&gt;

In the U.S., the Supreme Court decisions in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'': "ruled that the state's interest in the life of the fetus became compelling only at the point of viability, defined as the point at which the fetus can survive independently of its mother. Even after the point of viability, the state cannot favor the life of the fetus over the life or health of the pregnant woman. Under the right of privacy, physicians must be free to use their "medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother." On the same day that the Court decided Roe, it also decided Doe v.

====Cancer====
{{Update section|date=September 2022}}&lt;!-- Sources here are &gt;10 years old, and should be updated with new ones --&gt;
The rate of cancer during pregnancy is 0.02–1%, and in many cases, cancer of the mother leads to consideration of abortion to protect the life of the mother, or in response to the potential damage that may occur to the fetus during treatment. This is particularly true for [[cervical cancer]], the most common type of which occurs in 1 of every 2,000–13,000 pregnancies, for which initiation of treatment "cannot co-exist with preservation of fetal life (unless [[neoadjuvant chemotherapy]] is chosen)". Very early stage cervical cancers (I and IIa) may be treated by [[radical hysterectomy]] and pelvic [[lymph node]] dissection, [[radiation therapy]], or both, while later stages are treated by radiotherapy. Chemotherapy may be used simultaneously. Treatment of breast cancer during pregnancy also involves fetal considerations, because [[lumpectomy]] is discouraged in favor of modified [[radical mastectomy]] unless late-term pregnancy allows follow-up radiation therapy to be administered after the birth.&lt;ref name=Weisz&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weisz B, Schiff E, Lishner M | title = Cancer in pregnancy: maternal and fetal implications | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 384–393 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11476351 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/7.4.384 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposure to a single chemotherapy drug is estimated to cause a 7.5–17% risk of [[teratogenic]] effects on the fetus, with higher risks for multiple drug treatments. Treatment with more than 40&amp;nbsp;[[gray (unit)|Gy]] of radiation usually causes spontaneous abortion. Exposure to much lower doses during the first trimester, especially 8 to 15 weeks of development, can cause [[intellectual disability]] or [[microcephaly]], and exposure at this or subsequent stages can cause reduced intrauterine growth and birth weight. Exposures above 0.005–0.025&amp;nbsp;Gy cause a dose-dependent reduction in [[IQ]].&lt;ref name=Weisz /&gt; It is possible to greatly reduce exposure to radiation with abdominal shielding, depending on how far the area to be irradiated is from the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mayr NA, Wen BC, Saw CB | title = Radiation therapy during pregnancy | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 301–321 | date = June 1998 | pmid = 9629572 | doi = 10.1016/s0889-8545(05)70006-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11237773"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fenig E, Mishaeli M, Kalish Y, Lishner M | title = Pregnancy and radiation | journal = Cancer Treatment Reviews | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–7 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11237773 | doi = 10.1053/ctrv.2000.0193 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of birth itself may also put the mother at risk. According to Li ''et al.'', "[v]aginal delivery may result in dissemination of neoplastic cells into lymphovascular channels, haemorrhage, cervical laceration and implantation of malignant cells in the episiotomy site, while abdominal delivery may delay the initiation of non-surgical treatment."&lt;ref name="pmid19197101"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li WW, Yau TN, Leung CW, Pong WM, Chan MY | title = Large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the uterine cervix complicating pregnancy | journal = Hong Kong Medical Journal = Xianggang Yi Xue Za Zhi | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–72 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19197101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fetal health===
[[Congenital disorders]], revealed by [[prenatal screening]], motivate some women to seek abortions.&lt;ref name="bankole98"/&gt; [[Health outcomes for adults born prematurely|Health outcomes of preterm births]] include a significant probability of long-term [[neurodevelopmental impairment]] before gestational age of 29 weeks, with a higher probability with decreasing gestational age.&lt;ref name="z309"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Sarda | first1=Sujata P. | last2=Sarri | first2=Grammati | last3=Siffel | first3=Csaba | title=Global prevalence of long-term neurodevelopmental impairment following extremely preterm birth: a systematic literature review | journal=Journal of International Medical Research | volume=49 | issue=7 | date=2021 | issn=0300-0605 | pmid=34284680 | pmc=8299900 | doi=10.1177/03000605211028026 | page=030006052110280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, public opinion shifted after television personality [[Sherri Finkbine]]'s was exposed to [[thalidomide]], a [[teratogen]], in her fifth month of pregnancy. Unable to obtain a legal abortion in the United States, Finkbine traveled to Sweden. From 1962 to 1965, an outbreak of [[Rubella|German measles]] left 15,000 babies with severe birth defects. In 1967, the [[American Medical Association]] publicly supported liberalization of abortion laws. A [[National Opinion Research Center]] poll in 1965 showed 73% supported abortion when the mother's life was at risk, 57% when birth defects were present and 59% for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest.{{sfn|Doan|2007|p=57}}

===Abortion debate===
{{Main|Abortion debate}}
Induced abortion has long been the source of considerable debate. [[Medical ethics|Ethical]], [[Morality|moral]], [[Philosophical aspects of the abortion debate|philosophical]], [[Therapeutic abortion|biological]], [[Ethics in religion|religious]] and [[Abortion law|legal]] issues surrounding abortion are related to [[value system]]s. Opinions of abortion may be about [[fetal rights]], governmental authority, and [[women's rights]].

In both public and private debate, arguments presented in favor of or against abortion access focus on either the moral permissibility of an induced abortion, or the justification of laws permitting or restricting abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Farrell C | title =Abortion Debate| publisher =ABDO Publishing Company| year =2010| pages =6–7| isbn =978-1-61785-264-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Medical Association]] Declaration on Therapeutic Abortion notes, "circumstances bringing the interests of a mother into conflict with the interests of her unborn child create a dilemma and raise the question as to whether or not the pregnancy should be deliberately terminated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/a1/ |title=WMA Declaration on Therapeutic Abortion |publisher=World Medical Association |access-date=28 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151028182953/http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/a1/ |archive-date=28 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortion debates, especially pertaining to [[abortion law]]s, are often spearheaded by groups advocating one of these two positions. Groups who favor greater legal restrictions on abortion, including complete prohibition, most often describe themselves as "[[anti-abortion movement|pro-life]]" while groups who are against such legal restrictions describe themselves as "[[Abortion-rights movements|pro-choice]]".&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern abortion law===

{{See also|History of abortion law debate}}
{{AbortionLawsMap|size=330px}}

Current laws pertaining to abortion are diverse. Religious, moral, and cultural factors continue to influence abortion laws throughout the world. The [[right to life]], the right to liberty, the right to [[security of person]], and the right to [[reproductive health]] are major issues of human rights that sometimes constitute the basis for the existence or absence of abortion laws.

In jurisdictions where abortion is legal, certain requirements must often be met before a woman may obtain a legal abortion (an abortion performed without the woman's consent is considered [[feticide]] and is generally illegal). These requirements usually depend on the age of the fetus, often using a [[Pregnancy#Terminology|trimester]]-based system to regulate the window of legality, or as in the U.S., on a doctor's evaluation of the fetus' [[Fetal viability|viability]].

===Sex-selective abortion===
{{Main|Sex-selective abortion}}

[[Medical ultrasonography|Sonography]] and [[amniocentesis]] allow parents to determine sex before childbirth. The development of this technology has led to [[sex-selective abortion and female infanticide|sex-selective abortion]], or the termination of a fetus based on its sex. The selective termination of a female fetus is most common.

Sex-selective abortion is partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the birth rates of male and female children in some countries. The preference for male children is reported in many areas of Asia, and abortion used to limit female births has been reported in Taiwan, South Korea, India, and China.&lt;ref&gt;Banister, Judith.

Physicians and other abortion clinic staff have been murdered by abortion opponents. In the United States, at least four physicians have been murdered in connection with their work at abortion clinics, including [[David Gunn (doctor)|David Gunn]] (1993), [[John Britton (doctor)|John Britton]] (1994), [[Barnett Slepian]] (1998), and [[George Tiller]] (2009). In Canada, gynecologist [[Garson Romalis]] survived murder attempts in both 1994 and 2000. Besides physicians, killings have targeted other clinic staff, such as [[John Salvi|John Salvi's]] 1994 murder of two receptionists in Massachusetts clinic and [[Peter James Knight|Peter Knight's]] 2001 murder of a security guard in a [[Melbourne]] clinic. Notable perpetrators of anti-abortion violence include [[Eric Rudolph]], [[Scott Roeder]], [[Shelley Shannon]], and [[Paul Jennings Hill|Paul Hill]], the first person to be executed in the United States for murdering an abortion provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/feb/03/features11.g26 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=3 February 1999 |title=The bomber under siege | vauthors = Borger J |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222105914/https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/feb/03/features11.g26 |archive-date=22 February 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries have [[Legal protection of access to abortion|laws to protecting access to abortion]]. 
Such laws prevent abortion opponents from interfering with access to legal abortion services. For example, the American [[Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act]] bars the use of threats or violence to interfere with abortion access. Abortion access laws may also establish [[safe access zone]]s around abortion clinics, with limits on protests and enhanced penalties for anti-abortion violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Pridemore |first1=William Alex |author1-link=William Alex Pridemore |last2=Freilich |first2=Joshua D. |date=2007-12-01 |title=The Impact of State Laws Protecting Abortion Clinics and Reproductive Rights on Crimes Against Abortion Providers: Deterrence, Backlash, or Neither? |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10979-006-9078-0 |journal=Law and Human Behavior |language=en |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=611–627 |doi=10.1007/s10979-006-9078-0 |pmid=17268826 |issn=1573-661X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological pressure may also be used to limit abortion access. In 2003, Chris Danze organized anti-abortion organizations throughout Texas to prevent the construction of a [[Planned Parenthood]] facility in Austin. The organizations [[doxing|released the personal information]] online of those involved with construction, sent them up to 1200 phone calls a day and contacted their churches.{{sfn|Doan|2007|p=2}} Some protestors record women entering clinics on camera.{{sfn|Doan|2007|p=2}}
