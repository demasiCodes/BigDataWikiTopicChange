&lt;!-- Terminology --&gt;
'''Abortion''' is the ending of a [[pregnancy]] by removal or expulsion of an [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] before it can [[fetal viability|survive outside the uterus]].&lt;ref name="definition" group="note" /&gt; An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a [[miscarriage]] or spontaneous abortion. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an [[#Induced|induced abortion]], or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word ''abortion'' generally refers to an induced abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/503?rskey=TpobDi&amp;result=1#eid |website=www.oed.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/abortion|title=Abortion (noun)|publisher=Oxford Living Dictionaries|accessdate=8 June 2018|quote=''[mass noun]'' The deliberate termination of a human pregnancy, most often performed during the first 28 weeks of pregnancy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180528131142/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/abortion|archive-date=28 May 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar procedure after the fetus has potential to survive outside the [[womb]] is known as a "[[late termination of pregnancy]]" or less accurately as a "late term abortion".&lt;ref name=stuart&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grimes|first1=DA |last2=Stuart |first2=G |title=Abortion jabberwocky: the need for better terminology |journal=Contraception |year=2010 |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=93–96 |pmid=20103443 |doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2009.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surgical===

Up to 15 weeks' gestation, [[suction-aspiration abortion|suction-aspiration]] or [[vacuum aspiration]] are the most common surgical methods of induced abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Healthwise |url=http://www.webmd.com/hw/womens_conditions/tw1078.asp#tw1112 |title=Manual and vacuum aspiration for abortion |year=2004 |website=WebMD |accessdate=5 December 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070211155626/http://www.webmd.com/hw/womens_conditions/tw1078.asp| archivedate=11 February 2007| url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Manual vacuum aspiration'' (MVA) consists of removing the [[fetus]] or [[embryo]], [[placenta]], and membranes by suction using a manual syringe, while ''electric vacuum aspiration'' (EVA) uses an electric pump. These techniques can both be used very early in pregnancy. MVA can be used up to 14 weeks but is more often used earlier in the U.S. EVA can be used later.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

MVA, also known as "mini-suction" and "[[menstrual extraction]]" or EVA can be used in very early pregnancy when cervical dilation may not be required. [[Dilation and curettage]] (D&amp;C) refers to opening the cervix (dilation) and removing tissue (curettage) via suction or sharp instruments. D&amp;C is a standard gynecological procedure performed for a variety of reasons, including examination of the uterine lining for possible malignancy, investigation of abnormal bleeding, and abortion. The [[World Health Organization]] recommends ''sharp curettage'' only when suction aspiration is unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Managing Complications in Pregnancy and Childbirth: A Guide for Midwives and Doctors|author=World Health Organization|publisher=World Health Organization|year=2017|isbn=978-92-4-154587-7|location=Geneva|pages=|chapter=Dilatation and curettage|oclc=181845530|accessdate=30 July 2019|chapterurl=http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/impac/Procedures/Dilatetion_P61_P63.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dilation and evacuation]] (D&amp;E), used after 12 to 16 weeks, consists of opening the [[cervix]] and emptying the uterus using surgical instruments and suction. D&amp;E is performed vaginally and does not require an incision. [[Intact dilation and extraction]](D&amp;X) refers to a variant of D&amp;E sometimes used after 18 to 20 weeks when removal of an intact fetus improves surgical safety or for other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dilation and evacuation.

Abortion may also be performed surgically by hysterotomy or gravid hysterectomy. [[Hysterotomy abortion]] is a procedure similar to a [[caesarean section]] and is performed under [[general anesthesia]]. It requires a smaller incision than a caesarean section and can be used during later stages of pregnancy.  Gravid hysterectomy refers to removal of the whole uterus while still containing the pregnancy.  Hysterotomy and hysterectomy are associated with much higher rates of maternal morbidity and mortality than D&amp;E or induction abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=June 2013|title=Practice Bulletin No. 135: Second-Trimester Abortion|journal=Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology|language=en|volume=121|issue=6|pages=1394–1406|doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000431056.79334.cc|pmid=23812485|issn=0029-7844|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ace83a00d019d5dac64fd15e50a474b1e313e20a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labor induction abortion===

In places lacking the necessary medical skill for dilation and extraction, or where preferred by practitioners, an abortion can be induced by first [[Labor induction|inducing labor]] and then [[Late termination of pregnancy#Methods|inducing fetal demise]] if necessary.&lt;ref name=GLOWM_Late&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borgatta|first1=L|journal=Global Library of Women's Medicine|date=December 2014|volume=GLOWM.10444|doi=10.3843/GLOWM.10444|url=http://www.glowm.com/section_view/heading/Labor%20Induction%20Termination%20of%20Pregnancy/item/443|accessdate=25 September 2015|title=Labor Induction Termination of Pregnancy|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924082507/http://www.glowm.com/section_view/heading/Labor%20Induction%20Termination%20of%20Pregnancy/item/443|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes called "induced miscarriage". This procedure may be performed from 13 weeks gestation to the third trimester. Although it is very uncommon in the United States, more than 80% of induced abortions throughout the second trimester are labor-induced abortions in Sweden and other nearby countries.&lt;ref name=Labor_Induced_Abortion&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Society of Family Planning|title=Clinical Guidelines, Labor induction abortion in the second trimester|journal=Contraception|date=February 2011|volume=84|issue=1|pages=4–18|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2011.02.005|pmid=21664506|url=http://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(11)00057-6/pdf|quote=10. What is the effect of feticide on labor induction abortion outcome? Deliberately causing demise of the fetus before labor induction abortion is performed primarily to avoid transient fetal survival after expulsion; this approach may be for the comfort of both the woman and the staff, to avoid futile resuscitation efforts. Some providers allege that feticide also facilitates delivery, although little data support this claim. Transient fetal survival is very unlikely after intraamniotic installation of saline or urea, which are directly feticidal. Transient survival with misoprostol for labor induction abortion at greater than 18 weeks ranges from 0% to 50% and has been observed in up to 13% of abortions performed with high-dose oxytocin. Factors associated with a higher likelihood of transient fetal survival with labor induction abortion include increasing gestational age, decreasing abortion interval and the use of nonfeticidal inductive agents such as the PGE1 analogues.|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only limited data are available comparing this method with dilation and extraction.&lt;ref name=Labor_Induced_Abortion/&gt; Unlike D&amp;E, labor-induced abortions after 18 weeks may be complicated by the occurrence of brief fetal survival, which may be legally characterized as live birth. For this reason, labor-induced abortion is legally risky in the United States.&lt;ref name=Labor_Induced_Abortion/&gt;&lt;ref name=NAF_2015_Policy&gt;{{cite journal|title=2015 Clinical Policy Guidelines|publisher=National Abortion Federation|date=2015|url=http://prochoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2015_NAF_CPGs.pdf|accessdate=30 October 2015|quote=Policy Statement: Medical induction abortion is a safe and effective method for termination of pregnancies beyond the first trimester when performed by trained clinicians in medical offices, freestanding clinics, ambulatory surgery centers, and hospitals.

===Other methods===
Historically, a number of herbs reputed to possess abortifacient properties have been used in [[folk medicine]]. Among these are: [[tansy]], [[Mentha pulegium|pennyroyal]], [[black cohosh]], and the now-extinct [[silphium]].&lt;ref name="riddle2"&gt;{{Cite book|first=John M. |last=Riddle |title=Eve's herbs: a history of contraception and abortion in the West |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, MA |year=1997|isbn=978-0-674-27024-4 |oclc=36126503}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44–47, 62–63, 154–55, 230–31}}

In 1978 one woman in Colorado died and another was seriously injured when they attempted to procure an abortion by taking pennyroyal oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Pennyroyal oil poisoning and hepatoxicity | journal=Journal of the American Medical Association | year=1979|volume=242|issue=26|pages=2873–24|doi=10.1001/jama.1979.03300260043027| last1=Sullivan | first1=John B. |first2=Barry H. |last2=Rumack |first3=Harold Jr|last3=Thomas|display-authors=etal| url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a375e1290ef3349ed384a65e4bd7ccfae545ace6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because the indiscriminant use of herbs as abortifacients can cause serious—even lethal—side effects, such as [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome|multiple organ failure]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ciganda C, Laborde A |title=Herbal infusions used for induced abortion |journal=Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=235–39 |year=2003 |pmid=12807304 |doi=10.1081/CLT-120021104 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1c823bd63a67e07df76e65a34a83952a22134c24}}&lt;/ref&gt; such use is not recommended by physicians.

Abortion is sometimes attempted by causing trauma to the abdomen. The degree of force, if severe, can cause serious internal injuries without necessarily succeeding in inducing [[miscarriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Smith JP | title = Risky choices: The dangers of teens using self-induced abortion attempts | journal = Journal of Pediatric Health Care | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 147–51 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9652283 | doi = 10.1016/S0891-5245(98)90245-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Southeast Asia, there is an ancient tradition of attempting abortion through forceful abdominal massage.&lt;ref name="potts"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Potts |first1=M.| authorlink1=Malcolm Potts| last2=Graff |first2=M. |last3=Taing |first3=J. |doi=10.1783/147118907782101904 |title=Thousand-year-old depictions of massage abortion |journal=Journal of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Care |volume=33 |issue=4| pages=233–34 |year=2007 |pmid=17925100}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the [[bas relief]]s decorating the temple of [[Angkor Wat]] in Cambodia depicts a demon performing such an abortion upon a woman who has been sent to the [[underworld]].&lt;ref name="potts" /&gt;

Reported methods of unsafe, [[self-induced abortion]] include misuse of [[misoprostol]] and insertion of non-surgical implements such as knitting needles and clothes hangers into the uterus. These and other methods to terminate pregnancy may be called "induced miscarriage".  Such methods are rarely used in countries where surgical abortion is legal and available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Thapa |first1=S.R. |last2=Rimal |first2=D. |last3=Preston |first3=J. |title=Self induction of abortion with instrumentation |journal=Australian Family Physician |volume=35 |issue=9 |pages=697–98 |year=2006 |pmid=16969439 |url=http://www.racgp.org.au/afp/200609/11015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108181951/http://www.racgp.org.au/afp/200609/11015 |archivedate=8 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With each decade of the past fifty years the actual and proportionate frequency of this accident [perforation of the uterus] has increased, due, first, to the increase in the number of instrumentally induced abortions; second, to the proportionate increase in abortions handled by doctors as against those handled by midwives; and, third, to the prevailing tendency to use instruments instead of the finger in emptying the uterus.

==Incidence==
There are two commonly used methods of measuring the incidence of abortion:
* Abortion rate&amp;nbsp;– number of abortions per 1000 women between 15 and 44 years of age
* Abortion percentage&amp;nbsp;– number of abortions out of 100 known pregnancies (pregnancies include live births, abortions and miscarriages)

In many places, where abortion is illegal or carries a heavy social stigma, medical reporting of abortion is not reliable.&lt;ref name="Sedgh 2007"/&gt; For this reason, estimates of the incidence of abortion must be made without determining certainty related to standard error.&lt;ref name="Sedgh 2012" /&gt;

The number of abortions performed worldwide seems to have remained stable in recent years, with 41.6&amp;nbsp;million having been performed in 2003 and 43.8&amp;nbsp;million having been performed in 2008.&lt;ref name="Sedgh 2012" /&gt; The abortion rate worldwide was 28 per 1000 women, though it was 24 per 1000 women for developed countries and 29 per 1000 women for developing countries.&lt;ref name="Sedgh 2012" /&gt; The same 2012 study indicated that in 2008, the estimated abortion percentage of known pregnancies was at 21% worldwide, with 26% in developed countries and 20% in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Sedgh 2012" /&gt;

On average, the incidence of abortion is similar in countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal access to abortion. However, restrictive abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions performed unsafely.&lt;ref name=IJGO10/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Shah I, Ahman E |title=Unsafe abortion: global and regional incidence, trends, consequences, and challenges |journal=Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada |volume=31 |issue=12 |pages=1149–58 |date=December 2009 |pmid=20085681 |doi= 10.1016/s1701-2163(16)34376-6|quote=However, a woman's chance of having an abortion is similar whether she lives in a developed or a developing region: in 2003 the rates were 26 abortions per 1000 women aged 15 to 44 in developed areas and 29 per 1000 in developing areas.

The rate of legal, induced abortion varies extensively worldwide. According to the report of employees of Guttmacher Institute it ranged from 7 per 1000 women (Germany and Switzerland) to 30 per 1000 women (Estonia) in countries with complete statistics in 2008. The proportion of pregnancies that ended in induced abortion ranged from about 10% (Israel, the Netherlands and Switzerland) to 30% (Estonia) in the same group, though it might be as high as 36% in Hungary and Romania, whose statistics were deemed incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Sedgh |first1=G. |last2=Singh |first2=S. |last3=Henshaw |first3=S.K. |last4=Bankole |first4=A.|title=Legal Abortion Worldwide in 2008: Levels and Recent Trends |doi=10.1363/4318811 |journal=Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=188–98 |year=2011 |pmid=21884387 |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3708411.html |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107111306/http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3708411.html |archivedate=7 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[National Institute of Statistics (Romania)|National Institute of Statistics]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20110515195102/http://www.insse.ro/cms/files/Anuar%20statistic/02/02%20Populatie_ro.pdf Romanian Statistical Yearbook, chapter 2, page 62], 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

An American study in 2002 concluded that about half of women having abortions were using a form of [[birth control|contraception]] at the time of becoming pregnant. Inconsistent use was reported by half of those using [[condom]]s and three-quarters of those using the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]]; 42% of those using condoms reported failure through slipping or breakage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/3097748 |last1=Jones |first1=R.K. |last2=Darroch |first2=J.E. |last3=Henshaw |first3=S.K. |title=Contraceptive Use Among U.S. Women Having Abortions in 2000–2001 |journal=Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=294–303 |year=2002 |pmid=12558092 |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3429402.pdf |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615011127/http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3429402.pdf |archivedate=15 June 2006 |df=dmy-all |jstor=3097748 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guttmacher Institute estimated that "most abortions in the United States are obtained by minority women" because minority women "have much higher rates of unintended pregnancy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=SA |last=Cohen |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/gpr/11/3/gpr110302.html |title=Abortion and Women of Color: The Bigger Picture |journal=Guttmacher Policy Review |year=2008 |volume=11 |issue=3 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915094346/http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/gpr/11/3/gpr110302.html |archivedate=15 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The abortion rate may also be expressed as the average number of abortions a woman has during her reproductive years; this is referred to as ''total abortion rate'' (TAR).

Abortion rates also vary depending on the stage of pregnancy and the method practiced. In 2003, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) reported that 26% of reported legal induced abortions in the United States were known to have been obtained at less than 6 weeks' gestation, 18% at 7 weeks, 15% at 8 weeks, 18% at 9 through 10 weeks, 10% at 11 through 12 weeks, 6% at 13 through 15 weeks, 4% at 16 through 20 weeks and 1% at more than 21 weeks. 91% of these were classified as having been done by "[[curettage]]" ([[Suction-aspiration abortion|suction-aspiration]], [[dilation and curettage]], [[dilation and evacuation]]), 8% by "[[medical abortion|medical]]" means ([[mifepristone]]), &gt;1% by "[[instillation abortion|intrauterine instillation]]" (saline or [[prostaglandin]]), and 1% by "other" (including [[hysterotomy abortion|hysterotomy]] and [[hysterectomy]]).&lt;ref name="cdc2003"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Strauss |first1=L.T. |last2=Gamble |first2=S.B. |last3=Parker |first3=W.Y. |last4=Cook |first4=D.A. |last5=Zane |first5=S.B. |last6=Hamdan |first6=S. |title=Abortion surveillance – United States, 2003 |journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report Surveillance Summaries |volume=55 |issue=SS11 |pages=1–32 |year=2006 |pmid=17119534 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5511a1.htm |author7=Centers for Disease Control Prevention |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602171423/https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5511a1.htm |archivedate=2 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the CDC, due to data collection difficulties the data must be viewed as tentative and some fetal deaths reported beyond 20 weeks may be natural deaths erroneously classified as abortions if the removal of the dead fetus is accomplished by the same procedure as an induced abortion.&lt;ref name="guttmacher"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Guttmacher Institute |title=The limitations of U.S. statistics on abortion |work=Issues in Brief |location=New York |year=1997 |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/ib14.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404080239/http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/ib14.html |archivedate=4 April 2012 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guttmacher Institute estimated there were 2,200 [[intact dilation and extraction]] procedures in the US during 2000; this accounts for &lt;0.2% of the total number of abortions performed that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Finer |first1=L.B. |last2=Henshaw |first2=S.K. |title=Abortion Incidence and Services in the United States in 2000 |journal=Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=6–15 |year=2003 |pmid=12602752 |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3500603.html |doi=10.1363/3500603 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122204324/http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3500603.html |archivedate=22 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in England and Wales in 2006, 89% of terminations occurred at or under 12 weeks, 9% between 13 and 19 weeks, and 2% at or over 20 weeks. 64% of those reported were by vacuum aspiration, 6% by D&amp;E, and 30% were medical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Department of Health |year=2007 |title=Abortion statistics, England and Wales: 2006 |accessdate=12 October 2007 |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsStatistics/DH_075697 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206002417/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsStatistics/DH_075697 |archivedate=6 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are more second trimester abortions in developing countries such as China, India and Vietnam than in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cheng|first=Linan|date=1 November 2008|title=Surgical versus medical methods for second-trimester induced abortion: RHL commentary|work=The WHO Reproductive Health Library|location=Geneva|publisher=World Health Organization|url=http://www.who.int/rhl/fertility/abortion/CD006714_chengl_com/en/index.html|accessdate=10 February 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215134007/http://www.who.int/rhl/fertility/abortion/CD006714_chengl_com/en/index.html|archivedate=15 February 2009|df=dmy-all}} commentary on:&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lohr|first1=Patricia A.|last2=Hayes|first2=Jennifer L.|last3=Gemzell-Danielsson|first3=Kristina|date=23 January 2008|title=Surgical versus medical methods for second trimester abortion|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=1|page=CD006714|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006714.pub2|pmid=18254113|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2fa23e5da6ad1371403deb4f55c274e15d282170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Societal===
Some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last1=Fried |editor-first1=Marlene Gerber |title=From Privacy to Autonomy: The Conditions for Reproductive and Sexual Freedom|last=Copelon|first=Rhonda|encyclopedia=From Abortion to Reproductive Freedom: Transforming a Movement |date=1990 |publisher=South End Press |isbn=9780896083875 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=keE5EmSKYr0C&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=abortion%20poverty%20autonomy&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q=abortion%20poverty%20autonomy&amp;f=false |pages=27–43|quote=The prevalence of economically influenced abortions and the sterilization campaigns against poor, minority, and disabled women show us that autonomy is impossible without eradication of discrimination and poverty.

These factors can sometimes result in compulsory abortion or [[sex-selective abortion]].&lt;ref name="MissingWomen"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oster |first=Emily |authorlink=Emily Oster |title=Explaining Asia's "Missing Women": A New Look at the Data |journal=Population and Development Review |date=September 2005 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=529–535 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4994961 |accessdate=5 February 2019 |doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2005.00082.x |quote=Households have variously resorted to female infanticide and postnatal withholding of health care; and since the mid-1980s, when technology permitting fairly low-cost determination of the sex of fetuses became available, there has been a shift toward prenatal sex selection by means of induced abortion. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207131815/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4994961_Explaining_Asia's_Missing_Women_A_New_Look_at_the_Data |archive-date=7 February 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maternal and fetal health===
An additional factor is risk to maternal or fetal health, which was cited as the primary reason for abortion in over a third of cases in some countries and as a significant factor in only a single-digit percentage of abortions in other countries.&lt;ref name="guttmacher" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bankole98"/&gt;

In the U.S., the Supreme Court decisions in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'': "ruled that the state's interest in the life of the fetus became compelling only at the point of viability, defined as the point at which the fetus can survive independently of its mother. Even after the point of viability, the state cannot favor the life of the fetus over the life or health of the pregnant woman. Under the right of privacy, physicians must be free to use their "medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother." On the same day that the Court decided Roe, it also decided Doe v. Bolton, in which the Court defined health very broadly: "The medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors—physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's age—relevant to the well-being of the patient. All these factors may relate to health. This allows the attending physician the room he needs to make his best medical judgment."&lt;ref&gt;George J. Annas and Sherman Elias.

Public opinion shifted in America following television personality [[Sherri Finkbine]]'s discovery during her fifth month of pregnancy that she had been exposed to [[thalidomide]]. Unable to obtain a legal abortion in the United States, she traveled to Sweden. From 1962 to 1965, an outbreak of [[Rubella|German measles]] left 15,000 babies with severe birth defects. In 1967, the [[American Medical Association]] publicly supported liberalization of abortion laws. A National Opinion Research Center poll in 1965 showed 73% supported abortion when the mother's life was at risk, 57% when birth defects were present and 59% for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest.{{sfn|Doan|2007|p=57}}

====Cancer====
&lt;!-- Sources here are &gt;10 years old, and should be updated with new ones --&gt;
The rate of cancer during pregnancy is 0.02–1%, and in many cases, cancer of the mother leads to consideration of abortion to protect the life of the mother, or in response to the potential damage that may occur to the fetus during treatment. This is particularly true for [[cervical cancer]], the most common type of which occurs in 1 of every 2,000–13,000 pregnancies, for which initiation of treatment "cannot co-exist with preservation of fetal life (unless [[neoadjuvant chemotherapy]] is chosen)". Very early stage cervical cancers (I and IIa) may be treated by [[radical hysterectomy]] and pelvic [[lymph node]] dissection, [[radiation therapy]], or both, while later stages are treated by radiotherapy. Chemotherapy may be used simultaneously. Treatment of breast cancer during pregnancy also involves fetal considerations, because [[lumpectomy]] is discouraged in favor of modified [[radical mastectomy]] unless late-term pregnancy allows follow-up radiation therapy to be administered after the birth.&lt;ref name=Weisz&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/4/384.full.pdf |title=Cancer in pregnancy: maternal and fetal implications |pmid=11476351 |last1=Weisz |first1=B |last2=Schiff |first2=E |last3=Lishner |first3=M |year=2001 |volume=7 |pages=384–393 |issue=4 |journal=Human Reproduction Update |doi=10.1093/humupd/7.4.384 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015195038/http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/4/384.full.pdf |archivedate=15 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposure to a single chemotherapy drug is estimated to cause a 7.5–17% risk of [[teratogenic]] effects on the fetus, with higher risks for multiple drug treatments. Treatment with more than 40 [[gray (unit)|Gy]] of radiation usually causes spontaneous abortion. Exposure to much lower doses during the first trimester, especially 8 to 15 weeks of development, can cause [[intellectual disability]] or [[microcephaly]], and exposure at this or subsequent stages can cause reduced intrauterine growth and birth weight. Exposures above 0.005–0.025 Gy cause a dose-dependent reduction in [[IQ]].&lt;ref name=Weisz /&gt; It is possible to greatly reduce exposure to radiation with abdominal shielding, depending on how far the area to be irradiated is from the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mayr |first1=NA |last2=Wen |first2=BC |last3=Saw |first3=CB|title=Radiation therapy during pregnancy |journal=Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Clinics of North America |year=1998 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=301–21 |pmid=9629572 |doi=10.1016/s0889-8545(05)70006-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11237773"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fenig E, Mishaeli M, Kalish Y, Lishner M | title=Pregnancy and radiation. |journal=Cancer Treatment Reviews |year=2001 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |pmid=11237773 |doi=10.1053/ctrv.2000.0193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of birth itself may also put the mother at risk.

===Abortion debate===
{{Main|Abortion debate}}
Induced abortion has long been the source of considerable debate. [[Medical ethics|Ethical]], [[Morality|moral]], [[Philosophical aspects of the abortion debate|philosophical]], [[Therapeutic abortion|biological]], [[Ethics in religion|religious]] and [[Abortion law|legal]] issues surrounding abortion are related to [[value system]]s. Opinions of abortion may be about [[fetal rights]], governmental authority, and [[women's rights]].

In both public and private debate, arguments presented in favor of or against abortion access focus on either the moral permissibility of an induced abortion, or justification of laws permitting or restricting abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Courtney| last=Farrell| title =Abortion Debate| publisher =ABDO Publishing Company| year =2010| pages =6–7| isbn =978-1-61785-264-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Medical Association]] Declaration on Therapeutic Abortion notes, "circumstances bringing the interests of a mother into conflict with the interests of her unborn child create a dilemma and raise the question as to whether or not the pregnancy should be deliberately terminated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/a1/ |title=WMA Declaration on Therapeutic Abortion |publisher=World Medical Association |accessdate=28 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151028182953/http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/a1/ |archivedate=28 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortion debates, especially pertaining to [[abortion law]]s, are often spearheaded by groups advocating one of these two positions. Anti-abortion groups who favor greater legal restrictions on abortion, including complete prohibition, most often describe themselves as "pro-life" while abortion rights groups who are against such legal restrictions describe themselves as "pro-choice".&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the former position argues that a human fetus is a [[Personhood|human person]] with a [[right to life|right to live]], making abortion morally the same as [[murder]]. The latter position argues that a woman has certain [[reproductive rights]], especially the right to decide whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term.

{{AbortionLawsMap|size=330px}}

Current laws pertaining to abortion are diverse. Religious, moral, and cultural factors continue to influence abortion laws throughout the world. The [[right to life]], the right to liberty, the right to [[security of person]], and the right to [[reproductive health]] are major issues of human rights that sometimes constitute the basis for the existence or absence of abortion laws.

In jurisdictions where abortion is legal, certain requirements must often be met before a woman may obtain a safe, legal abortion (an abortion performed without the woman's consent is considered [[feticide]]). These requirements usually depend on the age of the fetus, often using a [[Pregnancy#Terminology|trimester]]-based system to regulate the window of legality, or as in the U.S., on a doctor's evaluation of the fetus' [[Fetal viability|viability]]. Some jurisdictions require a waiting period before the procedure, prescribe the distribution of information on [[prenatal development|fetal development]], or require that [[minors and abortion|parents be contacted]] if their minor daughter requests an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internationalfamilyplanningperspectives.org/pubs/MandatoryCounseling.pdf |title=The Impact of State Mandatory Counseling and Waiting Period Laws on Abortion: A Literature Review |publisher=Guttmacher Institute|author1=Theodore J.

Other jurisdictions ban abortion almost entirely. Many, but not all, of these allow legal abortions in a variety of circumstances. These circumstances vary based on jurisdiction, but may include whether the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest, the fetus' development is impaired, the woman's physical or mental well-being is endangered, or socioeconomic considerations make childbirth a hardship.&lt;ref name="Dev98-07" /&gt; In countries where abortion is banned entirely, such as [[Abortion in Nicaragua|Nicaragua]], medical authorities have recorded rises in maternal death directly and indirectly due to pregnancy as well as deaths due to doctors' fears of prosecution if they treat other gynecological emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European delegation visits Nicaragua to examine effects of abortion ban |date=26 November 2007 |publisher=Ipas |accessdate=15 June 2009 |url=http://www.ipas.org/Library/News/News_Items/European_delegation_visits_Nicaragua_to_examine_effects_of_abortion_ban.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417033829/http://www.ipas.org/Library/News/News_Items/European_delegation_visits_Nicaragua_to_examine_effects_of_abortion_ban.aspx |archivedate=17 April 2008 |quote=More than 82 maternal deaths had been registered in Nicaragua since the change.

===Sex-selective abortion===
{{Main|Sex-selective abortion}}

[[Medical ultrasonography|Sonography]] and [[amniocentesis]] allow parents to determine sex before childbirth. The development of this technology has led to [[sex-selective abortion and female infanticide|sex-selective abortion]], or the termination of a fetus based on sex. The selective termination of a female fetus is most common.

Sex-selective abortion is partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the birth rates of male and female children in some countries. The preference for male children is reported in many areas of Asia, and abortion used to limit female births has been reported in Taiwan, South Korea, India, and China.&lt;ref&gt;Banister, Judith.

[[Legal protection of access to abortion]] has been brought into some countries where abortion is legal. These laws typically seek to protect abortion clinics from obstruction, vandalism, picketing, and other actions, or to protect women and employees of such facilities from threats and harassment.

Far more common than physical violence is psychological pressure. In 2003, Chris Danze organized pro-life organizations throughout Texas to prevent the construction of a [[Planned Parenthood]] facility in Austin. The organizations [[doxing|released the personal information]] online, of those involved with construction, sending them up to 1200 phone calls a day and contacting their churches.&lt;ref name=Doan&gt;{{cite book|title=Opposition and Intimidation:The abortion wars and strategies of political harassment|author=Alesha E.
