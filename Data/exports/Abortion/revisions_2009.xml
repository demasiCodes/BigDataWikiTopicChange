'''Abortion''' is the termination of a [[pregnancy (mammals)|pregnancy]] by the removal or expulsion from the [[uterus]] of a [[fetus]] or [[embryo]], resulting in or caused by its death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=KiRHpRl7TjsC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=definition+of+abortion&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=definition&amp;f=false  Gynaecology for Lawyers]  By Trevor Dutt, Margaret P. Matthews&lt;/ref&gt; An abortion can occur spontaneously due to [[complication (medicine)|complications]] during pregnancy or can be induced, in humans and other species. In the context of human pregnancies, an abortion induced to preserve the health of the [[gravidity|gravida]] (pregnant female) is termed a ''therapeutic abortion'', while an abortion induced for any other reason is termed an ''elective abortion''. The term ''abortion'' most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a [[pregnancy|human pregnancy]], while spontaneous abortions are usually termed [[miscarriage]]s. &lt;!--Annotation: This paragraph serves to disambiguate abortion terminology and and types--&gt;

Abortion has a long [[history of abortion|history]] and has been induced by various methods including herbal [[abortifacient]]s, the use of sharpened tools, [[physical trauma]] and other [[traditional medicine|traditional methods]]. Contemporary medicine utilizes [[medication]]s and [[surgery|surgical procedures]] to induce abortion. The [[abortion law|legality]], prevalence, and cultural views on abortion vary substantially around the world. In many parts of the world there is prominent and divisive [[Abortion debate|public controversy]] over the [[ethical aspects of abortion|ethical]] and legal issues of abortion. Abortion and abortion-related issues feature prominently in the national politics in many nations often involving the opposing [[pro-life]] and [[pro-choice]] worldwide social movements. Incidence of abortion has declined worldwide, as access to family planning education and contraceptive services has increased. Abortion incidence in the United States declined 8% from 1996 to 2003.&lt;ref name="worldtrends"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sedgh|first=Gilda |date=September 2007 |title=Legal Abortion Worldwide: Incidence and Recent Trends|journal=International Family Planning Perspectives|volume=33|issue=3|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3310607.html|accessdate=2009-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Annotation: This paragraph covers related issues and current events.--&gt;

==Types of abortion==
===Spontaneous abortion===
{{main|Miscarriage}}
[[Image:Human_Embryo_-_Approximately_8_weeks_estimated_gestational_age.jpg|right|thumb|A complete spontaneous abortion at about six weeks from [[fertilization|conception]], i.e. eight weeks from [[gestational age|LMP]]]]

Spontaneous abortion (also known as miscarriage) is the expulsion of an embryo or fetus due to accidental trauma or [[Death by natural causes|natural causes]] before approximately the 22nd [[gestational age|week of gestation]]; the definition by gestational age varies by country.&lt;ref name="WHOmiscarriage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/impac/Symptoms/Vaginal_bleeding_early_S7_S16.html|title=Managing Complications in Pregnancy and Childbirth - A guide for midwives and doctors|last=Department of Reproductive Health and Research, World Health Organization|date=2003|accessdate=2009-04-07}} NB: This definition is subject to regional differences, see [[Miscarriage#Terminology|miscarriage]].&lt;/ref&gt; Most miscarriages are due to incorrect replication of chromosomes; they can also be caused by environmental factors. A pregnancy that ends before 37 weeks of gestation resulting in a [[live birth|live-born]] infant is known as a "[[premature birth]]". When a fetus dies [[in utero]] after about 22 weeks, or during [[childbirth|delivery]], it is usually termed "[[stillbirth|stillborn]]". Premature births and stillbirths are generally not considered to be miscarriages although usage of these terms can sometimes overlap.

Between 10% and 50% of pregnancies end in clinically apparent miscarriage, depending upon the age and health of the pregnant woman.&lt;ref name=BBCmiscarriage&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2176898.stm |title=Q&amp;A: Miscarriage |date=2002-08-06 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most miscarriages occur very early in pregnancy, in most cases, they occur so early in the pregnancy that the woman is not even aware that she was pregnant. One study testing hormones for ovulation and pregnancy found that 61.9% of conceptuses were lost prior to 12 weeks, and 91.7% of these losses occurred subclinically, without the knowledge of the once pregnant woman.&lt;ref name="pmid7117572"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Edmonds DK, Lindsay KS, Miller JF, Williamson E, Wood PJ |title=Early embryonic mortality in women |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=447–453 |year=1982 |pmid=7117572 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The risk of spontaneous abortion decreases sharply after the 10th week from the [[gestational age|last menstrual period]] (LMP).&lt;ref name=BBCmiscarriage /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lennart |last=Nilsson |authorlink=Lennart Nilsson |coauthors=Lars Hamberger | page=91 |title=[[A Child Is Born (book)|A child is born]] |publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |location=[[Garden City, New York]] |year=1990 |origdate=1965 |pages= |isbn=0-385-40085-3 |oclc=21412111}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study of 232 pregnant women showed "virtually complete &lt;nowiki&gt;[pregnancy loss]&lt;/nowiki&gt; by the end of the embryonic period" (10 weeks LMP) with a pregnancy loss rate of only 2 percent after 8.5 weeks LMP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=E. |last=Jauniaux |coauthors=P.

===Induced abortion===
A pregnancy can be intentionally aborted in many ways. The manner selected depends chiefly upon the [[gestational age]] of the embryo or fetus, which increases in size as it ages.&lt;ref&gt;Menikoff, Jerry. [http://books.google.com/books?id=2jXOYv3X8zsC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=size+fetus+abortion+technique&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=MymmSayEFJaQyATt6JiUDg Law and Bioethics], p. 78 (Georgetown University Press 2001): "As the fetus grows in size, however, the vacuum aspiration method becomes increasingly difficult to use."&lt;/ref&gt; Specific procedures may also be selected due to legality, regional availability, and doctor-patient preference. Reasons for procuring induced abortions are typically characterized as either therapeutic or elective. An abortion is medically referred to as therapeutic when it is performed to:
*save the life of the pregnant woman;&lt;ref name="roche1"&gt;Roche, Natalie E. (2004). [http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3311.htm Therapeutic Abortion]. Retrieved 2006-03-08.&lt;/ref&gt;
*preserve the woman's physical or mental health;&lt;ref name="roche1"/&gt;
*terminate pregnancy that would result in a child born with a [[congenital disorder]] that would be [[death|fatal]] or associated with significant [[morbidity]];&lt;ref name="roche1"/&gt; or
*[[selective reduction|selectively reduce]] the number of fetuses to lessen health risks associated with [[multiple birth|multiple pregnancy]].&lt;ref name="roche1"/&gt;
An abortion is referred to as elective when it is performed at the request of the woman "for reasons other than maternal health or fetal disease."&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia Britannica'', (2007), Vol 26, p. 674.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abortion methods==
[[Image:Abortionmethods.png|thumb|350px|right|[[Gestational age]] may determine which abortion methods are practiced.]]
===Medical===
{{main|Medical abortion}}

"Medical abortions" are non-surgical abortions that use [[pharmaceutical drug]]s, and are only effective in the first trimester of pregnancy. {{Fact|date=February 2009}} Medical abortions comprise 10% of all abortions in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Strauss LT, Gamble SB, Parker WY, Cook DA, Zane SB, Hamdan S |title=Abortion surveillance—United States, 2004 |journal=MMWR Surveill Summ |volume=56 |issue=9 |pages=1–33 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=18030283 |doi= |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5609a1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Europe.{{Fact|date=February 2009}} Combined regimens include [[methotrexate]] or [[mifepristone]], followed by a [[prostaglandin]] (either [[misoprostol]] or [[gemeprost]]: misoprostol is used in the U.S.; gemeprost is used in the UK and Sweden.) When used within 49 days gestation, approximately 92% of women undergoing medical abortion with a combined regimen completed it without surgical intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Spitz, I.M|title=Early pregnancy termination with mifepristone and misoprostol in the United States|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|year=1998|volume=338|issue=18|pmid=9562577|doi=10.1056/NEJM199804303381801|page=1241|last2=Bardin|first2=CW|last3=Benton|first3=L|last4=Robbins|first4=A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misoprostol can be used alone, but has a lower efficacy rate than combined regimens. In cases of failure of medical abortion, vacuum or manual aspiration is used to complete the abortion surgically.

===Surgical===
[[File:Vacuum-aspiration (single).svg|thumb|A vacuum aspiration abortion at eight weeks gestational age (six weeks after fertilization).&lt;br /&gt;'''1:''' Amniotic sac&lt;br /&gt;'''2:''' Embryo&lt;br /&gt;'''3:''' Uterine lining&lt;br /&gt;'''4:''' Speculum&lt;br /&gt;'''5:''' Vacurette&lt;br /&gt;'''6:''' Attached to a suction pump]]
In the first 12 weeks, [[suction-aspiration abortion|suction-aspiration]] or vacuum abortion is the most common method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Healthwise |url=http://www.webmd.com/hw/womens_conditions/tw1078.asp#tw1112 |title=Manual and vacuum aspiration for abortion |year=2004 |publisher=[[WebMD]] |accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Manual [[Vacuum aspiration]]'' (MVA) abortion consists of removing the [[fetus]] or [[embryo]], [[placenta]] and membranes by suction using a manual [[syringe]], while ''electric [[vacuum aspiration]]'' (EVA) abortion uses an electric [[pump]]. These techniques are comparable, and differ in the mechanism used to apply suction, how early in pregnancy they can be used, and whether cervical dilation is necessary. MVA, also known as "mini-suction" and "[[menstrual extraction]]", can be used in very early pregnancy, and does not require cervical dilation. Surgical techniques are sometimes referred to as 'Suction (or surgical) Termination Of Pregnancy' (STOP). From the 15th week until approximately the 26th, [[dilation and evacuation]] (D&amp;E) is used. D&amp;E consists of opening the [[cervix]] of the [[uterus]] and emptying it using surgical instruments and suction.

''[[Dilation and curettage]]'' (D&amp;C), the second most common method of abortion, is a standard gynecological procedure performed for a variety of reasons, including examination of the uterine lining for possible malignancy, investigation of abnormal bleeding, and abortion. ''[[Curettage]]'' refers to cleaning the walls of the [[uterus]] with a [[curette]]. The [[World Health Organization]] recommends this procedure, also called ''sharp curettage,'' only when MVA is unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[World Health Organization]] |chapter=Dilatation and curettage |chapterurl=http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/impac/Procedures/Dilatetion_P61_P63.html |title=Managing Complications in Pregnancy and Childbirth: A Guide for Midwives and Doctors |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |location=[[Geneva]] |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=92-4-154587-9 |oclc=181845530 |accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''D and C'', or sometimes ''suction curette'', is used as a [[euphemism]] for the first trimester abortion procedure, whichever the method used.

Other techniques must be used to induce abortion in the second [[trimester]]. Premature delivery can be induced with [[prostaglandin]]; this can be coupled with injecting the [[amniotic sac|amniotic fluid]] with hypertonic solutions containing [[saline (medicine)|saline]] or [[urea]]. After the 16th week of gestation, abortions can be induced by [[intact dilation and extraction]] (IDX) (also called intrauterine cranial decompression), which requires surgical decompression of the fetus' head before evacuation. IDX is sometimes called "partial-birth abortion," which has been [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|federally banned]] in the United States. A [[hysterotomy abortion]] is a procedure similar to a [[caesarean section]] and is performed under [[general anesthesia]]. It requires a smaller incision than a caesarean section and is used during later stages of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="encarta"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=McGee |first=Glenn |authorlink=Glenn McGee |coauthors=[[Jon F.

==Incidence of induced abortion==
The incidence and reasons for induced abortion vary regionally. It has been estimated that approximately 46 million abortions are performed worldwide every year. Of these, 26 million are said to occur in [[abortion law|places where abortion is legal]]; the other 20 million happen where the procedure is illegal. Some countries, such as Belgium (11.2 per 100 known pregnancies) and the Netherlands (10.6 per 100), have a low rate of induced abortion, while others like Russia (62.6 per 100) and [[Vietnam]] (43.7 per 100) have a comparatively high rate. The world ratio is 26 induced abortions per 100 known pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;Henshaw, Stanley K., Singh, Susheela, and Haas, Taylor. (1999).

Abortion rates also vary depending on the stage of [[pregnancy]] and the method practiced. In 2003, from data collected in those areas of the United States that sufficiently reported [[gestational age]], it was found that 88.2% of abortions were conducted at or prior to 12 weeks, 10.4% from 13 to 20 weeks, and 1.4% at or after 21 weeks. 90.9% of these were classified as having been done by "[[curettage]]" ([[Suction-aspiration abortion|suction-aspiration]], [[Dilation and curettage]], [[Dilation and evacuation]]), 7.7% by "[[medical abortion|medical]]" means ([[mifepristone]]), 0.4% by "[[instillation abortion|intrauterine instillation]]" ([[saline (medicine)|saline]] or [[prostaglandin]]), and 1.0% by "other" (including [[hysterotomy abortion|hysterotomy]] and [[hysterectomy]]).&lt;ref name="cdc2003"&gt;Strauss, L.T., Gamble, S.B., Parker, W.Y, Cook, D.A., Zane, S.B., and Hamdan, S.

A 1998 aggregated study, from 27 countries, on the reasons women seek to terminate their pregnancies concluded that common factors cited to have influenced the abortion decision were: desire to delay or end [[childbirth|childbearing]], concern over the interruption of [[employment|work]] or [[education]], issues of financial or relationship stability, and perceived immaturity.&lt;ref name="bankole98"&gt;Bankole, Akinrinola, Singh, Susheela, and Haas, Taylor.

Some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures. These might include the stigmatization of [[disabled]] persons, preference for children of a specific [[sex]], disapproval of [[single parent|single motherhood]], insufficient economic support for [[family|families]], lack of access to or rejection of contraceptive methods, or efforts toward [[population control]] (such as [[People's Republic of China|China's]] [[one-child policy]]). These factors can sometimes result in compulsory abortion or [[sex-selective abortion]].

Induced abortion can be traced to ancient times.&lt;ref name="devereux"&gt;{{cite book |last=Devereux |first=G. |chapter=A typological study of abortion in 350 primitive, ancient, and pre-industrial societies |chapterurl=http://www.popline.org/docs/671051 |accessdate=2008-12-02 |editor=Harold Rosen |title=Abortion in America; medical, psychiatric, legal, anthropological, and religious considerations |year=1967 |location=[[Boston]] |publisher=[[Beacon Press]] |oclc=187445}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence to suggest that, historically, pregnancies were terminated through a number of methods, including the administration of [[abortifacient]] herbs, the use of sharpened implements, the application of abdominal pressure, and other techniques.

The [[Hippocratic Oath]], the chief statement of [[medical ethics]] for Hippocratic physicians in [[Ancient Greece]], forbade doctors from helping to procure an abortion by [[pessary]]. [[Soranus (Greek Physician)|Soranus]], a second-century Greek [[physician]], suggested in his work ''[[Gynaecology]]'' that women wishing to abort their pregnancies should engage in energetic exercise, energetic jumping, carrying heavy objects, and riding animals. He also prescribed a number of recipes for herbal baths, pessaries, and [[bloodletting]], but advised against the use of sharp instruments to induce miscarriage due to the risk of organ [[perforation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mary R. |last=Lefkowitz |authorlink=Mary Lefkowitz |coauthors=Maureen B.

Such folk remedies, however, varied in effectiveness and were not without risk. [[Tansy]] and [[pennyroyal]], for example, are two [[poison]]ous [[herbs]] with serious [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] that have at times been used to terminate pregnancy.

===Sex-selective abortion and female infanticide===
{{Main|Sex-selective abortion and female infanticide}}

[[Medical ultrasonography|Sonography]] and [[amniocentesis]] allow parents to determine [[sex]] before [[childbirth|birth]]. The development of this technology has led to [[sex-selective abortion and female infanticide|sex-selective abortion]], or the targeted termination of female [[fetus]]es.

It is suggested that sex-selective abortion might be partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the [[birth rate]]s of male and female children in some places. The preference for male children is reported in many areas of Asia, and abortion used to limit female births has been reported in [[Mainland China]], [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], South Korea, and India.&lt;ref&gt;Banister, Judith.

{{main|Unsafe abortion}}
Women seeking to terminate their pregnancies sometimes resort to unsafe methods, particularly where and when access to legal abortion is being barred.

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) defines an unsafe abortion as being "a procedure ... carried out by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment that does not conform to minimal medical standards, or both."&lt;ref name="whounsafe"/&gt; Unsafe abortions are sometimes known colloquially as "back-alley" abortions. This can include a person without medical training, a professional health provider operating in sub-standard conditions, or [[self-induced abortion|the woman herself]].

Unsafe abortion remains a [[public health]] concern today due to the higher incidence and severity of its associated complications, such as incomplete abortion, [[sepsis]], [[hemorrhage]], and damage to internal organs.

{{main|Abortion debate|Pro-choice|Pro-life}}
In the [[history of abortion]], induced abortion has been the source of considerable [[debate]], [[controversy]], and [[activism]]. An [[opinion|individual's position]] on the complex [[ethical]], [[moral]], [[philosophical]], [[biology|biological]], and [[legal]] issues is often related to his or her [[value system]]. The main positions are the [[pro-choice]] position, which argues in favor of access to abortion, and the [[pro-life]] position, which argues against access to abortion. Opinions of abortion may be described as being a combination of beliefs on its morality, and beliefs on the responsibility, ethical scope, and proper extent of [[government]]al [[authority|authorities]] in [[policy|public policy]]. [[religion|Religious ethics]] also has an influence upon both personal opinion and the greater debate over abortion (see [[religion and abortion]]).

Abortion debates, especially pertaining to [[abortion law]]s, are often spearheaded by [[advocacy|groups advocating]] one of these two positions. In the United States, those in favor of greater legal restrictions on, or even complete prohibition of abortion, most often describe themselves as [[pro-life]] while those against legal restrictions on abortion describe themselves as [[pro-choice]]. Generally, the pro-life position argues that a human fetus is a [[human being]] with the [[right to life|right to live]] making abortion tantamount to [[murder]]. The pro-choice position argues that a woman has certain [[reproductive rights]], especially the choice whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term.

In both public and private debate, arguments presented in favor of or against abortion focus on either the moral permissibility of an induced abortion, or justification of [[laws]] permitting or restricting abortion.

Debate also focuses on whether the [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman should have to notify and/or have the [[consent]] of others in distinct cases: a [[minor (law)|minor]], her parents; a [[marriage|legally married]] or [[common-law marriage|common-law]] wife, her husband; or a pregnant woman, the biological father. In a 2003 Gallup poll in the United States, 79% of male and 67% of female respondents were in favor of legalized mandatory spousal notification; overall support was 72% with 26% opposed.&lt;ref&gt;The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.

===Public opinion===
{{Main|Societal attitudes towards abortion}}

A number of [[opinion poll]]s around the world have explored [[public opinion]] regarding the issue of abortion. Results have varied from poll to poll, country to country, and region to region, while varying with regard to different aspects of the issue.

A May 2005 survey examined attitudes toward abortion in 10 European countries, asking polltakers whether they agreed with the statement, "If a woman doesn't want children, she should be allowed to have an abortion". The highest level of approval was 81% (in the Czech Republic); the lowest was 47% (in Poland).&lt;ref&gt;TNS Sofres. (May 2005).

A similar poll in April 2009 surveyed people in the United States about [[Abortion in the United States#Public Opinion|U.S. opinion on abortion]]; 18% said that abortion should be "legal in all cases", 28% said that abortion should be "legal in most cases", 28% said abortion should be "illegal in most cases" and 16% said abortion should be "illegal in all cases".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1212/abortion-gun-control-opinion-gender-gap Pew Research Center].''(2009).

In early [[pregnancy]], levels of [[estrogen]] increase, leading to [[breast]] growth in preparation for [[lactation]]. The hypothesis proposes that if this process is interrupted by an abortion{{ndash}} before full maturity in the third [[trimester]]{{ndash}} then more relatively vulnerable immature cells could be left than there were prior to the pregnancy, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer.

====Fetal pain debate====

====Effect upon crime rate====
{{Main|Legalized abortion and crime effect}}

A theory attempts to draw a [[correlation]] between the United States' unprecedented nationwide decline of the overall [[crime rate]] during the 1990s and the decriminalization of abortion 20 years prior.

The suggestion was brought to widespread attention by a 1999 [[academic paper]], ''[[The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime]]'', authored by the [[economist]]s [[Steven Levitt|Steven D. Levitt]] and John Donohue. They attributed the drop in crime to a reduction in individuals said to have a higher statistical probability of committing crimes: unwanted children, especially those born to mothers who are [[African-American]], [[poverty|impoverished]], [[teenage pregnancy|adolescent]], [[education|uneducated]], and [[single parent|single]]. The change coincided with what would have been the adolescence, or peak years of potential criminality, of those who had not been born as a result of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and similar cases. Donohue and Levitt's study also noted that states which legalized abortion before the rest of the nation experienced the lowering crime rate pattern earlier, and those with higher abortion rates had more pronounced reductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John J. |last=Donohue |year=2001 |month=May |title=[[The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime]] |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=116 |issue=2 |pages=379–420 |doi=10.1162/00335530151144050 |accessdate=2008-12-06 |last2=Levitt |first2=Steven D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fellow economists Christopher Foote and Christopher Goetz criticized the [[methodology]] in the Donohue-Levitt study, noting a lack of accommodation for statewide yearly variations such as [[cocaine]] use, and recalculating based on incidence of crime [[per capita]]; they found no [[statistically significant]] results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Foote |first=Christopher L. |year=2008 |month=February |title=The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime: Comment |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=123 |issue=1 |pages=407–423 |doi=10.1162/qjec.2008.123.1.407 |accessdate=2008-12-06 |last2=Goetz |first2=Christopher F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levitt and Donohue responded to this by presenting an adjusted [[data set]] which took into account these concerns and reported that the data maintained the statistical significance of their initial paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Donohue |first=John J. |year=2008 |month=February |title=Measurement Error, Legalized Abortion, and the Decline in Crime: A Response to Foote and Goetz |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=123 |issue=1 |pages=425–440 |doi=10.1162/qjec.2008.123.1.425 |accessdate=2008-12-06 |last2=Levitt |first2=Steven D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such research has been criticized by some as being [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]], [[discrimination|discriminatory]] as to [[race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[social class|socioeconomic class]], and as promoting [[eugenic]]s as a solution to [[crime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Crime-Abortion Study Continues to Draw Pro-life Backlash |date=1999-08-11 |publisher=The Pro-Life Infonet |url=http://ohioroundtable.org/library/articles/life/crimeabortion.html |work=Ohio Roundtable Online Library |accessdate=2008-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=J.B.F. |url=http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Jan2000/Editorial.asp |title=Abortion and the Lower Crime Rate |year=2000 |month=January |work=St. Anthony Messenger |accessdate=2008-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levitt states in his book ''[[Freakonomics]]'' that they are neither promoting nor negating any course of action&amp;mdash;merely reporting data as economists.

The [[Soviet Union]], with legislation in 1920, and [[Iceland]], with legislation in 1935, were two of the first countries to generally allow abortion. The second half of the 20th century saw the liberalization of abortion laws in other countries. The ''[[Abortion Act 1967]]'' allowed abortion for limited reasons in Great Britain. In the 1973 case, ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] struck down state laws banning abortion, ruling that such laws violated an implied [[right to privacy]] in the [[United States Constitution]]. The [[Supreme Court of Canada]], similarly, in the case of ''[[R. v. Morgentaler]]'', discarded its criminal code regarding abortion in 1988, after ruling that such restrictions violated the security of person guaranteed to women under the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''. Canada later struck down provincial regulations of abortion in the case of ''[[R. v. Morgentaler (1993)]].'' By contrast, [[Abortion in the Republic of Ireland|abortion in Ireland]] was affected by the addition of an [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|amendment]] to the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution]] in 1983 by popular [[referendum]], recognizing "the right to life of the unborn".

Current laws pertaining to abortion are diverse. Religious, moral, and cultural sensibilities continue to influence abortion laws throughout the world. The [[right to life]], the right to [[liberty]], the right to [[security of person]], and the right to [[reproductive rights|reproductive health]] are major issues of [[human rights]] that are sometimes used as justification for the existence or absence of laws controlling abortion. Many countries in which abortion is legal require that certain criteria be met in order for an abortion to be obtained, often, but not always, using a [[trimester]]-based system to regulate the window of legality:
*In the United States, some states impose a 24-hour waiting period before the procedure, prescribe the distribution of information on [[prenatal development|fetal development]], or require that [[minors and abortion|parents be contacted]] if their [[minor (law)|minor]] daughter requests an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawserver.com/abortion Interactive maps comparing U.S. abortion restrictions by state] LawServer.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the United Kingdom, as in some other countries, two doctors must first certify that an abortion is medically or socially necessary before it can be performed.
*In Canada, a similar requirement was rejected as unconstitutional in 1988. 

Other countries, in which abortion is normally illegal, will allow one to be performed in the case of [[rape]], [[incest]], or danger to the pregnant woman's life or health. 
*A few nations ban abortion entirely: [[Abortion in Chile|Chile]], [[Abortion in El Salvador|El Salvador]], [[Abortion in Malta|Malta]], and [[Abortion in Nicaragua|Nicaragua]], with consequent rises in maternal death directly and indirectly due to pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European delegation visits Nicaragua to examine effects of abortion ban (November 26, 2007)|publisher=Ipas |accessdate=2009-06-15| url=http://www.ipas.org/Library/News/News_Items/European_delegation_visits_Nicaragua_to_examine_effects_of_abortion_ban.aspx }} "More than 82 maternal deaths had been  registered in Nicaragua since the change. During this same period, indirect obstetric deaths,  or deaths caused by illnesses aggravated by the normal effects of pregnancy and not due  to direct obstetric causes, have doubled."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://insidecostarica.com/special_reports/2008-06/nicaragua_womens_movement.htm |title=NICARAGUA: "The Women’s Movement Is in Opposition" |date=28 June 2008 |place=Montevideo |agency=IPS |publisher=Inside Costa Rica}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2006, the [[Politics of Chile|Chilean government]] began the free distribution of [[emergency contraception]].&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Jen.

* In [[Bangladesh]], abortion is illegal, but the government has long supported a network of "menstrual regulation clinics", where [[menstrual extraction]] ([[manual vacuum aspiration]]) can be performed as menstrual hygiene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surgical Abortion: History and Overview|publisher=National Abortion Federation|accessdate=2006-09-04|url=http://www.prochoice.org/education/resources/surg_history_overview.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In places where abortion is illegal or carries heavy social stigma, pregnant women may engage in [[medical tourism]] and travel to countries where they can terminate their pregnancy. Women without the means to travel can resort to providers of illegal abortions or try to do it themselves.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Need Abortion, Will Travel author=Marcy Bloom |date=February 25, 2008|publisher=RH Reality Check |accessdate=2009-06-15| url=http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/blog/2008/02/25/need-abortion-will-travel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USA, about 8% of abortions are performed on women who travel from another state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States: Percentage of Legal Abortions Obtained by Out-of-State Residents, 2005|publisher=The Kaiser Family Foundation|accessdate=2009-06-14| url=http://www.statehealthfacts.kff.org/profileind.jsp?rgn=1&amp;cat=10&amp;ind=467}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that is driven at least partly by differing limits on abortion according to gestational age or the scarcity of doctors trained and willing to do later abortions.

==In other animals==
{{See|Miscarriage#In other animals}}
Spontaneous abortion occurs in various animals. For example, in sheep, it may be caused by crowding through doors, or being chased by dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, James. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=RXMuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=abortion+and+husbandry&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WjmvGj-fB2&amp;sig=8qH_WrPR08YEwPKr_c6PHDUOMmQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=erDbSeSVBoz4MY-F7M4I&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#PPA124,M1 Sheep Husbandry in Canada]'', p. 124 (1911).&lt;/ref&gt; In cows, abortion may be caused by contagious disease, such as [[Brucellosis]] or [[Campylobacter]], but can often be controlled by vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/B/BeefCattleAndBeefProduction/ManagementAndHusbandryOfBeefCattle/en "Beef cattle and Beef production: Management and Husbandry of Beef Cattle”], ''Encyclopaedia of New Zealand'' (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many other diseases are known to increase the risk of miscarriage in humans and other animals.{{Fact|date=April 2009}}

Abortion may also be induced in animals, in the context of [[animal husbandry]]. For example, abortion may be induced in [[mares]] that have been mated improperly, or that have been purchased by owners who did not realize the mares were pregnant, or that are pregnant with twin [[foal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, Angus et al. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=jlZAT-9VwUIC&amp;pg=PA563&amp;lpg=PA563&amp;dq=%22induce+abortion%22+and+husbandry&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6T9w3LtpsI&amp;sig=aEYDFpnMIbLaKlstxK1MGK2rxwQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eLTbSY7EO5muMrXUkMkI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7 Equine Reproduction]'', p. 563 (Wiley-Blackwell 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feticide]] can occur in [[horses]] and [[zebras]] due to male harassment of pregnant mares or [[forced copulation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berger|first=Joel W|date=5 May 1983|title=Induced abortion and social factors in wild horses|journal=Nature|location=London|volume=303|pages=59–61|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v303/n5912/abs/303059a0.html|doi=10.1038/303059a0|pmid=6682487|issue=5912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pluháček|first=Jan|date=2000|title=Male infanticide in captive plains zebra, Equus burchelli|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=59|pages=689–694|url=http://af.czu.cz/~bartos/publications/pdf/Pluhacek_Bartos_2000_AB.pdf|doi=10.1006/anbe.1999.1371|pmid=10792924|last2=Bartos|first2=L|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pluháček|first=Jan|date=2005|title=Further evidence for male infanticide and feticide in captive plains zebra, Equus burchelli|journal=Folia Zool.|volume=54|issue=3|pages= 258–262|url=http://www.ivb.cz/folia/54/3/258-262.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the frequency in the wild has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=JW|first=Fitzpatrick|date=October 1991|title=Changes in herd stallions among feral horse bands and the absence of forced copulation and induced abortion |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin/Heidelberg|volume=29|issue=3|pages=217–219|issn=0340-5443 (Print) 1432-0762 (Online)|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/k1543n1548987255/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male [[Gray langur]] monkeys may attack females following male takeover, causing miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agoramoorthy |first=G.|date=August 1988|title=Abortions in free ranging Hanuman langurs (Presbytis entellus)—a male induced strategy?|journal=Human Evolution|publisher=Springer|location=Netherlands|volume=3|issue=4|pages=297–308|issn=0393-9375 (Print) 1824-310X (Online)|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/324g107410293474/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
