An '''abortion''' is the termination of a [[pregnancy (mammals)|pregnancy]] by the removal or expulsion of an [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] from the [[uterus]], resulting in or caused by its death. An abortion can occur spontaneously due to [[Complication (medicine)|complications]] during pregnancy or can be induced. ''Abortion'' as a term most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a [[pregnancy|human pregnancy]], while spontaneous abortions are usually termed [[miscarriage]]s.

Abortion has a long [[history of abortion|history]] and has been induced by various methods including herbal [[abortifacient]]s, the use of sharpened tools, physical trauma and other [[traditional medicine|traditional methods]].  Modern medicine utilizes [[medication]]s and [[surgery|surgical procedures]] to induce abortion. The [[abortion law|legality]], prevalence, and cultural views on abortion vary substantially around the world. In many parts of the world there is intense [[Abortion debate|public debate]] over the [[Ethical aspects of abortion|ethical]] and [[Abortion law|legal]] aspects of abortion. The approximate number of induced abortions performed worldwide in 2003 was 42 million, which declined from nearly 46 million in 1995.&lt;ref name="Worldwide"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_IAW.html |title=Facts on Induced Abortion Worldwide |accessdate=2008-01-29 |format= |work=guttmacher.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of abortion==
===Spontaneous abortion===
{{main|Miscarriage}}

Spontaneous abortion (also known as miscarriage) is the expulsion of an embryo or fetus due to accidental trauma or [[Death by natural causes|natural causes]]. Most miscarriages are due to incorrect replication of chromosomes; they can also be caused by environmental factors. Spontaneous abortions, generally referred to as miscarriages, occur when an [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] is lost due to natural causes before the 20th [[gestational age|week of gestation]].  A pregnancy that ends between 20 and 37 weeks of gestation, if it results in a [[Live birth|live-born]] infant, is known as a "[[premature birth]]".  When a fetus dies [[in utero]] after about 20 weeks, or during [[childbirth|delivery]], it is termed "[[stillbirth|stillborn]]".  Premature births and stillbirths are generally not considered to be miscarriages although usage of these terms can sometimes overlap.

Most miscarriages occur very early in pregnancy. Between 10% and 50% of pregnancies end in clinically apparent miscarriage, depending upon the age and health of the pregnant woman.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wuphysicians.wustl.edu/dept.asp?pageID=8&amp;ID=35 Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility: Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (Recurrent Miscarriage)]." (n.d.) Retrieved 2006-01-18 from Washington University School of Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology web site.&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, they occur so early in the pregnancy that the woman is not even aware that she was pregnant. One study testing hormones for ovulation and pregnancy found that 61.9% of conceptuses were lost prior to 12 weeks, and 91.7% of these losses occurred subclinically, without the knowledge of the woman.&lt;ref name="pmid7117572"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Edmonds DK, Lindsay KS, Miller JF, Williamson E, Wood PJ |title=Early embryonic mortality in women |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=447–53 |year=1982 |pmid=7117572 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The risk of spontaneous abortion decreases sharply after the 10th week from the last menstrual period [[gestational age|(LMP)]],&lt;ref&gt; -[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2176898.stm Q&amp;A: Miscarriage]. (August 6 , 2002). ''BBC News.'' Retrieved January 10, 2007. &lt;br /&gt;- [[Lennart Nilsson]]. (1990) ''A Child is Born.'' &lt;/ref&gt; with a loss rate between 8.5 weeks LMP and birth of about two percent; pregnancy loss is “virtually complete by the end of the embryonic period."&lt;ref&gt;Rodeck, Charles; Whittle, Martin.  ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=0BY0hx2l5uoC&amp;pg=PA835&amp;lpg=PA835&amp;dq=%22early+pregnancy+loss%22+and+weeks&amp;source=web&amp;ots=RZSIYEWK6N&amp;sig=3v2skknEA6qVVaoMnx03AAN_JpU&amp;hl=en#PPA836,M1 Fetal Medicine: Basic Science and Clinical Practice]'' (Elsevier Health Sciences 1999), page 835.&lt;/ref&gt;

This risk of spontaneous abortion is greater in those with a known history of several spontaneous abortions or an induced abortion, those with systemic diseases, and those over the age 35.  Other causes can be infection (of either the woman or fetus), immune response, or serious systemic disease. A spontaneous abortion can also be caused by accidental [[Physical trauma|trauma]]; intentional trauma or stress to cause miscarriage is considered induced abortion or [[feticide]].&lt;ref name="Fetal Homicide Laws"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncsl.org/programs/health/fethom.htm |title=Fetal Homicide Laws |accessdate=2008-03-20 |format= |work=ncsl.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Induced abortion===
A pregnancy can be intentionally aborted in many ways. The manner selected depends chiefly upon the [[gestational age]] of the embryo or fetus, in addition to the legality, regional availability, and doctor-patient preference for specific procedures. Reasons for procuring induced abortions are typically characterized as either therapeutic or elective. An abortion is considered to be therapeutic when it is performed to:
*save the life of the pregnant woman;&lt;ref name="roche1"&gt;Roche, Natalie E. (2004). [http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3311.htm Therapeutic Abortion]. Retrieved 2006-03-08.&lt;/ref&gt;
*preserve the woman's physical or mental health;&lt;ref name="roche1"/&gt;
*terminate pregnancy that would result in a child born with a [[congenital disorder]] that would be [[death|fatal]] or associated with significant [[morbidity]];&lt;ref name="roche1"/&gt; or
*[[selective reduction|selectively reduce]] the number of fetuses to lessen health risks associated with [[multiple birth|multiple pregnancy]].&lt;ref name="roche1"/&gt;

Any abortion that is not therapeutic is by definition elective.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}&lt;!--if it's "by definition" it should be cited--&gt;

==Abortion methods==
===Surgical===
[[Image:Abortionmethods.png|thumb|right|[[Gestational age]] may determine which abortion methods are practiced.]]
In the first 12 weeks, [[suction-aspiration abortion|suction-aspiration]] or vacuum abortion is the most common method.&lt;ref&gt;Healthwise. [http://www.webmd.com/hw/womens_conditions/tw1078.asp#tw1112 Manual and vacuum aspiration for abortion]. (2004). ''WebMD.'' Retrieved 2006-08-19.&lt;/ref&gt;    ''Manual [[Vacuum aspiration]]'' (MVA) abortion consists of removing the [[fetus]] or [[embryo]] by suction using a manual [[syringe]], while ''electric [[vacuum aspiration]]'' (EVA) abortion uses an electric [[pump]]. These techniques are comparable, and differ in the mechanism used to apply suction, how early in pregnancy they can be used, and whether cervical dilation is necessary. MVA, also known as "mini-suction" and "[[menstrual extraction]]", can be used in very early pregnancy, and does not require cervical dilation. Surgical techniques are sometimes referred to as 'Suction (or surgical) Termination Of Pregnancy' (STOP).  From the 15th week until approximately the 26th, [[dilation and evacuation]] (D&amp;E) is used. D&amp;E consists of opening the [[cervix]] of the [[uterus]] and emptying it using surgical instruments and suction.

''[[Dilation and curettage]]'' (D&amp;C), the second most common method of abortion, is a standard gynecological procedure performed for a variety of reasons, including examination of the uterine lining for possible malignancy, investigation of abnormal bleeding, and abortion. ''[[Curettage]]'' refers to cleaning the walls of the [[uterus]] with a [[curette]]. The [[World Health Organization]] recommends this procedure, also called ''sharp curettage,'' only when MVA is unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (2003). [http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/impac/Procedures/Dilatetion_P61_P63.html Managing complications in pregnancy and childbirth: a guide for midwives and doctors]. Retrieved 2006-08-19.&lt;/ref&gt;   The term ''D and C'', or sometimes ''suction curette'', is used as a [[euphemism]] for the first trimester abortion procedure, whichever the method used.

Other techniques must be used to induce abortion in the second [[trimester]]. Premature delivery can be induced with [[prostaglandin]]; this can be coupled with injecting the [[amniotic sac|amniotic fluid]] with caustic solutions containing [[saline (medicine)|saline]] or [[urea]].  After the 16th week of gestation, abortions can be induced by [[intact dilation and extraction]] (IDX) (also called intrauterine cranial decompression), which requires surgical decompression of the fetus' head before evacuation.  IDX is sometimes called "[[partial-birth abortion]]," which has been [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|federally banned]] in the United States. A [[hysterotomy abortion]] is a procedure similar to a [[caesarean section]], and is performed under [[general anesthesia]] because it is considered major abdominal surgery. It requires a smaller incision than a caesarean section and is used during later stages of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="encarta"&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761553899/Abortion.html#s3 Abortion].

===Medical===
{{main|Medical abortion}}

Effective in the first trimester of pregnancy, non-surgical abortions (referred to as 'medical abortions') comprise 10% of all abortions in the United States and Europe. Combined regimens include [[methotrexate]] or [[mifepristone]], followed by a [[prostaglandin]] (either [[misoprostol]] or [[gemeprost]]: misoprostol is used in the U.S.; gemeprost is used in the UK and Sweden.) When used within 49 days gestation, approximately 92% of women undergoing medical abortion with a combined regimen completed it without surgical intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Spitz, I.M. et al|title=Early pregnancy termination with mifepristone and misoprostol in the United States|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|year=1998|volume=338|issue=18|pmid=9562577|doi=10.1056/NEJM199804303381801|pages=1241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misoprostol can be used alone, but has a lower efficacy rate than combined regimens. In cases of failure of medical abortion, vacuum or manual aspiration is used to complete the abortion surgically.

==Incidence of induced abortion==
The incidence and reasons for induced abortion vary regionally. It has been estimated that approximately 46 million abortions are performed worldwide every year. Of these, 26 million are said to occur in [[abortion law|places where abortion is legal]]; the other 20 million happen where the procedure is illegal. Some countries, such as Belgium (11.2 per 100 known pregnancies) and the Netherlands (10.6 per 100), have a low rate of induced abortion, while others like Russia (62.6 per 100) and [[Vietnam]] (43.7 per 100) have a comparatively high rate. The world ratio is 26 induced abortions per 100 known pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;Henshaw, Stanley K., Singh, Susheela, &amp; Haas, Taylor. (1999).

Abortion rates also vary depending on the stage of [[pregnancy]] and the method practiced. In 2003, from data collected in those areas of the United States that sufficiently reported [[gestational age]], it was found that 88.2% of abortions were conducted at or prior to 12 weeks, 10.4% from 13 to 20 weeks, and 1.4% at or after 21 weeks. 90.9% of these were classified as having been done by "[[curettage]]" ([[Suction-aspiration abortion|suction-aspiration]], [[Dilation and curettage]], [[Dilation and evacuation]]), 7.7% by "[[medical abortion|medical]]" means ([[mifepristone]]), 0.4% by "[[instillation abortion|intrauterine instillation]]" ([[saline (medicine)|saline]] or [[prostaglandin]]), and 1.0% by "other" (including [[hysterotomy abortion|hysterotomy]] and [[hysterectomy]]).&lt;ref name="cdc2003"&gt;Strauss, L.T., Gamble, S.B., Parker, W.Y, Cook, D.A., Zane, S.B., &amp; Hamdan, S.

Some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures. These might include the stigmatization of [[disabled]] persons, preference for children of a specific [[sex]], disapproval of [[single parent|single motherhood]], insufficient economic support for [[family|families]], lack of access to or rejection of contraceptive methods, or efforts toward [[population control]] (such as [[People's Republic of China|China's]] [[one-child policy]]). These factors can sometimes result in compulsory abortion or [[sex-selective abortion]].

===Sex-selective abortion===
{{Main|Sex-selective abortion and infanticide}}

The advent of both [[Medical ultrasonography|sonography]] and [[amniocentesis]] has allowed parents to determine [[sex]] before [[childbirth|birth]]. This has led to the occurrence of [[sex-selective abortion and infanticide|sex-selective abortion]] or the targeted termination of a [[fetus]] based upon its sex.

It is suggested that sex-selective abortion might be partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the [[birth rate]]s of male and female children in some places. The preference for male children is reported in many areas of Asia, and abortion used to limit female births has been reported in [[Mainland China]], [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], South Korea, and India.&lt;ref&gt;Banister, Judith.

Where and when access to safe abortion has been barred, due to explicit sanctions or general unavailability, women seeking to terminate their pregnancies have sometimes resorted to unsafe methods.

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) defines an unsafe abortion as being "a procedure...carried out by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment that does not conform to minimal medical standards, or both."&lt;ref name="whounsafe"/&gt; Unsafe abortions are known colloquially as "back-alley" abortions.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Stanek, WorldNetDaily 2009, http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=51451 Retrieved 25 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This can include a person without medical training, a professional health provider operating in sub-standard conditions, or [[self-induced abortion|the woman herself]].

Unsafe abortion remains a [[public health]] concern today due to the higher incidence and severity of its associated complications, such as incomplete abortion, [[sepsis]], [[hemorrhage]], and damage to internal organs. WHO estimates that 19 million unsafe abortions occur around the world annually and that 68,000 of these result in the woman's death.&lt;ref name="whounsafe"&gt;World Health Organization. (2004).

{{main|Abortion debate|Pro-choice|Pro-life}}
In the [[history of abortion]], induced abortion has been the source of considerable [[debate]], [[controversy]], and [[activism]]. An [[opinion|individual's position]] on the complex [[ethical]], [[moral]], [[philosophical]], [[Biology|biological]], and [[legal]] issues is often related to his or her [[value system]]. Opinions of abortion may be best described as being a combination of beliefs on its morality, and beliefs on the responsibility, ethical scope, and proper extent of [[government]]al [[authority|authorities]] in [[Policy|public policy]]. [[religion|Religious ethics]] also has an influence upon both personal opinion and the greater debate over abortion (see [[religion and abortion]]).

Abortion debates, especially pertaining to [[abortion law]]s, are often spearheaded by [[advocacy|advocacy groups]] belonging to one of two camps. In the United States, most often those in favor of greater legal restrictions on, or even complete prohibition of abortion, describe themselves as [[pro-life]] while those against legal restrictions on abortion describe themselves as [[pro-choice]]. Both are used to indicate the central principles in arguments for and against abortion: "Is the fetus a human being with a fundamental right to ''life''?" for pro-life advocates, and, for those who are pro-choice, "Does a woman have the right to ''choose'' whether or not to continue a pregnancy?"

In both public and private debate, arguments presented in favor of or against abortion focus on either the moral permissibility of an induced abortion, or justification of [[laws]] permitting or restricting abortion. Arguments on morality and legality tend to collide and combine, complicating the issue at hand.

Debate also focuses on whether the [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman should have to notify and/or have the [[consent]] of others in distinct cases: a [[minor (law)|minor]], her parents; a [[marriage|legally married]] or [[common-law marriage|common-law]] wife, her husband; or a pregnant woman, the biological father. In a 2003 Gallup poll in the United States, 79% of male and 67% of female respondents were in favor of spousal notification; overall support was 72% with 26% opposed.&lt;ref&gt;The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.

In early [[pregnancy]], levels of [[estrogen]] increase, leading to [[breast]] growth in preparation for [[lactation]]. The hypothesis proposes that if this process is interrupted by an abortion{{ndash}} before full maturity in the third [[trimester]]{{ndash}} then more relatively vulnerable immature cells could be left than there were prior to the pregnancy, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer. The hypothesis mechanism was first proposed and explored in [[rat]] studies conducted in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="RUSSO"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Russo J, Russo I |title=Susceptibility of the mammary gland to carcinogenesis.

====Fetal pain debate====

Fetal pain, its existence, and its implications are part of a larger debate about abortion. Many researchers in the area of fetal development believe that a fetus is unlikely to feel pain until after the seventh month of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9053416/ "Study: Fetus feels no pain until third trimester"], Associated Press via MSNBC (2005-08-24).

A review by researchers from the [[University of California, San Francisco]] in ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]]'' concluded that data from dozens of medical reports and studies indicate that fetuses are unlikely to feel pain until the [[third trimester]] of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lee SJ, Ralston HJ, Drey EA, Partridge JC, Rosen MA |title=Fetal pain: a systematic multidisciplinary review of the evidence |journal=JAMA |volume=294 |issue=8 |pages=947–54 |year=2005 |pmid=16118385 |doi=10.1001/jama.294.8.947}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9053416/ "Study: Fetus feels no pain until third trimester"] MSNBC&lt;/ref&gt; There is an emerging consensus among developmental [[neurobiology|neurobiologists]] that the establishment of [[Human thalamus|thalamocortical]] connections (at about 26 weeks) is a critical event with regard to fetal perception of pain.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Martin and Everitt, Barry.

====Effect upon crime rate====
{{Main|Legalized abortion and crime effect}}

A theory attempts to draw a [[correlation]] between the United States' unprecedented nationwide decline of the overall [[crime rate]] during the 1990s and the decriminalization of abortion 20 years prior.

The suggestion was brought to widespread attention by a 1999 [[academic paper]], ''[[The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime]]'', authored by the [[economist]]s [[Steven Levitt|Steven D. Levitt]] and John Donohue. They attributed the drop in crime to a reduction in individuals said to have a higher statistical probability of committing crimes: unwanted children, especially those born to mothers who are [[African-American]], [[poverty|impoverished]], [[teenage pregnancy|adolescent]], [[education|uneducated]], and [[single parent|single]]. The change coincided with what would have been the adolescence, or peak years of potential criminality, of those who had not been born as a result of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and similar cases. Donohue and Levitt's study also noted that states which legalized abortion before the rest of the nation experienced the lowering crime rate pattern earlier, and those with higher abortion rates had more pronounced reductions.&lt;ref&gt;Donohue, John J. and Levitt, Steven D. (2001). [http://ssrn.com/abstract=174508 The impact of legalized abortion on crime].''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' Retrieved 2006-02-11. &lt;/ref&gt;

Fellow economists Christopher Foote and Christopher Goetz criticized the [[methodology]] in the Donohue-Levitt study, noting a lack of accommodation for statewide yearly variations such as [[cocaine]] use, and recalculating based on incidence of crime [[per capita]]; they found no [[statistically significant]] results.&lt;ref&gt;Foote, Christopher L. and Goetz, Christopher F. (2005). [http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/wp/wp2005/wp0515.pdf Testing economic hypotheses with state-level data: a comment on Donohue and Levitt (2001)]. ''Working Papers, 05-15''. Retrieved 2006-02-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Levitt and Donohue responded to this by presenting an adjusted [[data set]] which took into account these concerns and reported that the data maintained the statistical significance of their initial paper.&lt;ref&gt;Donohue, John J. and Levitt, Steven D.

Such research has been criticized by some as being [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]], [[discrimination|discriminatory]] as to [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[social class|socioeconomic class]], and as promoting [[eugenic]]s as a solution to [[crime]].&lt;ref&gt;"Crime-Abortion Study Continues to Draw Pro-life Backlash."

==Abortion law==
{{main|Abortion law|History of abortion law}}
{{see also|Reproductive rights}}
[[Image:AbortionLawsMap.png|thumb|right|International status of abortion law ([[:Image:AbortionLawsMap.png|detail]]). ]]

Before the scientific discovery that human development begins at [[fertilization]], [[English common law]] allowed abortions to be performed before "[[quickening]]", the earliest perception of fetal movement by a woman during pregnancy, until both pre- and post-quickening abortions were criminalized by ''[[Lord Ellenborough's Act]]'' in 1803.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/abtrbng/lea.htm Lord Ellenborough’s Act]." (1998). ''The Abortion Law Homepage.'' Retrieved February 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1861, the [[British Parliament]] passed the ''[[Offences Against The Person Act 1861|Offences Against the Person Act]]'', which continued to outlaw abortion and served as a model for similar prohibitions in some other nations.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Population Division. (2002). [http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion Abortion Policies: A Global Review]. Retrieved February 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet Union]], with legislation in 1920, and [[Iceland]], with legislation in 1935, were two of the first countries to generally allow abortion. The second half of the 20th century saw the liberalization of abortion laws in other countries. The ''[[Abortion Act 1967]]'' allowed abortion for limited reasons in the United Kingdom. In the 1973 case, ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] struck down state laws banning abortion, ruling that such laws violated an implied [[right to privacy]] in the [[United States Constitution]]. The [[Supreme Court of Canada]], similarly, in the case of ''[[R. v. Morgentaler]]'', discarded its criminal code regarding abortion in 1988, after ruling that such restrictions violated the security of person guaranteed to women under the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''. Canada later struck down provincial regulations of abortion in the case of ''[[R. v. Morgentaler (1993)]].'' By contrast, [[abortion in Ireland]] was affected by the addition of an [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|amendment]] to the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution]] in 1983 by popular [[referendum]], recognizing "the right to life of the unborn".

Current laws pertaining to abortion are diverse. Religious, moral, and cultural sensibilities continue to influence abortion laws throughout the world. The [[right to life]], the right to [[liberty]], the right to [[security of person]], and the right to [[Reproductive rights|reproductive health]] are major issues of [[human rights]] that are sometimes used as justification for the existence or absence of laws controlling abortion. Many countries in which abortion is legal require that certain criteria be met in order for an abortion to be obtained, often, but not always, using a [[trimester]]-based system to regulate the window of legality:
*In the United States, some states impose a 24-hour waiting period before the procedure, prescribe the distribution of information on [[prenatal development|fetal development]], or require that [[minors and abortion|parents be contacted]] if their [[Minor (law)|minor]] daughter requests an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawserver.com/abortion Interactive maps comparing U.S. abortion restrictions by state] LawServer&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the United Kingdom, as in some other countries, two doctors must first certify that an abortion is medically or socially necessary before it can be performed.

Other countries, in which abortion is normally illegal, will allow one to be performed in the case of [[rape]], [[incest]], or danger to the pregnant woman's life or health. A few nations ban abortion entirely: [[Abortion in Chile|Chile]], [[El Salvador]], [[Malta]], Ireland and [[Abortion in Nicaragua|Nicaragua]], although in 2006 the [[Politics of Chile|Chilean government]] began the free distribution of [[emergency contraception]].&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Jen.

Retrieved 2006-12-07. &lt;/ref&gt; In [[Bangladesh]], abortion is illegal, but the government has long supported a network of "menstrual regulation clinics", where [[menstrual extraction]] ([[manual vacuum aspiration]]) can be performed as menstrual hygiene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surgical Abortion: History and Overview|publisher=National Abortion Federation|accessdate=2006-09-04|url=http://www.prochoice.org/education/resources/surg_history_overview.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In places where abortion is illegal or carries heavy social stigma, pregnant women may engage in [[medical tourism]] and travel to countries where they can terminate their pregnancy. In the USA, it is not unusual for women to travel from one state to another for reasons of termination of pregnancy.
