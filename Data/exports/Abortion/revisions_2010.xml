'''Abortion''' is the termination of a [[pregnancy (mammals)|pregnancy]] by the removal or expulsion of a [[fetus]] or [[embryo]] from the [[uterus]], resulting in or caused by its death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=KiRHpRl7TjsC&amp;pg=PA173 |title=Gynaecology for Lawyers |author=Dutt T, Matthews MP |volume=14 |series-title=Medico-legal practitioner series |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |isbn=9781859412152}}&lt;/ref&gt; An abortion can occur spontaneously due to [[complication (medicine)|complications]] during pregnancy or can be induced, in humans and other species. In the context of human pregnancies, an abortion induced to preserve the health of the [[gravidity|gravida]] (pregnant female) is termed a ''therapeutic abortion'', while an abortion induced for any other reason is termed an ''elective abortion''. The term ''abortion'' most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a [[pregnancy|human pregnancy]], while spontaneous abortions are usually termed [[miscarriage]]s. &lt;!--Annotation: This paragraph serves to disambiguate abortion terminology and and types--&gt;

Abortion has a long [[history of abortion|history]] and has been induced by various methods including herbal [[abortifacient]]s, the use of sharpened tools, [[physical trauma]], and other [[traditional medicine|traditional methods]]. Contemporary medicine utilizes medications and surgical procedures to induce abortion. The [[abortion law|legality]], prevalence, cultural, and religious views on abortion vary substantially around the world. In many parts of the world there is prominent and divisive [[Abortion debate|public controversy]] over the [[ethical aspects of abortion|ethical]] and legal issues of abortion. Abortion and abortion-related issues feature prominently in the national politics in many nations, often involving the opposing [[pro-life]] and [[pro-choice]] worldwide social movements ([[Pro-choice#Term_controversy|both self-named]]).

===Spontaneous===
{{Main|Miscarriage}}
Spontaneous abortion (also known as miscarriage) is the expulsion of an embryo or fetus due to accidental trauma or natural causes before approximately the 22nd [[gestational age|week of gestation]]; the definition by gestational age varies by country.&lt;ref name="WHOmiscarriage"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/impac/Symptoms/Vaginal_bleeding_early_S7_S16.html |title=Managing Complications in Pregnancy and Childbirth – A guide for midwives and doctors |last=Department of Reproductive Health and Research |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2003 |accessdate=2009-04-07}} NB: This definition is subject to regional differences, see [[Miscarriage#Terminology|miscarriage]].&lt;/ref&gt; Most miscarriages are due to incorrect replication of chromosomes; they can also be caused by environmental factors. A pregnancy that ends before 37 weeks of gestation resulting in a [[live birth|live-born]] infant is known as a "[[premature birth]]". When a fetus dies [[in utero]] after about 22 weeks, or during [[childbirth|delivery]], it is usually termed "[[stillbirth|stillborn]]". Premature births and stillbirths are generally not considered to be miscarriages although usage of these terms can sometimes overlap.

Between 10% and 50% of pregnancies end in clinically apparent miscarriage, depending upon the age and health of the pregnant woman.&lt;ref name=BBCmiscarriage&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2176898.stm |title=Q&amp;A: Miscarriage |date=2002-08-06 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most miscarriages occur very early in pregnancy, in most cases, they occur so early in the pregnancy that the woman is not even aware that she was pregnant. One study testing hormones for [[ovulation]] and pregnancy found that 61.9% of [[conceptus]]es were lost prior to 12 weeks, and 91.7% of these losses occurred subclinically, without the knowledge of the once pregnant woman.&lt;ref name="pmid7117572"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Edmonds DK, Lindsay KS, Miller JF, Williamson E, Wood PJ |title=Early embryonic mortality in women |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=447–453 |year=1982 |pmid=7117572 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Induced===
A pregnancy can be intentionally aborted in many ways. The manner selected depends chiefly upon the [[gestational age]] of the embryo or fetus, which increases in size as the pregnancy progresses.&lt;ref&gt;Menikoff, Jerry. [http://books.google.com/books?id=2jXOYv3X8zsC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=size+fetus+abortion+technique&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=MymmSayEFJaQyATt6JiUDg Law and Bioethics], p. 78 (Georgetown University Press 2001): "As the fetus grows in size, however, the vacuum aspiration method becomes increasingly difficult to use."&lt;/ref&gt; Specific procedures may also be selected due to legality, regional availability, and doctor-patient preference. Reasons for procuring induced abortions are typically characterized as either therapeutic or elective. An abortion is medically referred to as ''therapeutic'' when it is performed to:
*save the life of the pregnant woman;&lt;ref name="roche1"&gt;Roche, Natalie E. (2004). [http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3311.htm Therapeutic Abortion]. Retrieved 2006-03-08.&lt;/ref&gt;
*preserve the woman's physical or mental health;&lt;ref name="roche1"/&gt;
*terminate pregnancy that would result in a child born with a [[congenital disorder]] that would be fatal or associated with significant [[morbidity]];&lt;ref name="roche1"/&gt; or
*[[selective reduction|selectively reduce]] the number of fetuses to lessen health risks associated with [[multiple birth|multiple pregnancy]].&lt;ref name="roche1"/&gt;
An abortion is referred to as ''elective'' when it is performed at the request of the woman "for reasons other than maternal health or fetal disease."&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia Britannica'', (2007), Vol 26, p. 674.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
[[Image:Abortionmethods.png|thumb|350px|right|[[Gestational age]] may determine which abortion methods are practiced.]]

===Medical===
{{Main|Medical abortion}}

"Medical abortions" are non-surgical abortions that use pharmaceutical drugs. Medical abortions comprise 10% of all abortions in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Strauss LT, Gamble SB, Parker WY, Cook DA, Zane SB, Hamdan S |title=Abortion surveillance—United States, 2004 |journal=MMWR Surveill Summ |volume=56 |issue=9 |pages=1–33 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=18030283 |doi= |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5609a1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined regimens include [[methotrexate]] or [[mifepristone]], followed by a [[prostaglandin]] (either [[misoprostol]] or [[gemeprost]]: misoprostol is used in the U.S.; gemeprost is used in the UK and Sweden.) When used within 49 days gestation, approximately 92% of women undergoing medical abortion with a combined regimen completed it without surgical intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Spitz, I.M|title=Early pregnancy termination with mifepristone and misoprostol in the United States|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|year=1998|volume=338|issue=18|pmid=9562577|doi=10.1056/NEJM199804303381801|page=1241|last2=Bardin|first2=CW|last3=Benton|first3=L|last4=Robbins|first4=A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misoprostol can be used alone, but has a lower efficacy rate than combined regimens. In cases of failure of medical abortion, vacuum or manual aspiration is used to complete the abortion surgically.

In the first 12 weeks, [[suction-aspiration abortion|suction-aspiration]] or vacuum abortion is the most common method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Healthwise |url=http://www.webmd.com/hw/womens_conditions/tw1078.asp#tw1112 |title=Manual and vacuum aspiration for abortion |year=2004 |publisher=[[WebMD]] |accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Manual [[vacuum aspiration]]'' (MVA) abortion consists of removing the [[fetus]] or [[embryo]], [[placenta]] and membranes by suction using a manual syringe, while ''electric [[vacuum aspiration]]'' (EVA) abortion uses an electric pump. These techniques are comparable, and differ in the mechanism used to apply suction, how early in pregnancy they can be used, and whether cervical dilation is necessary. MVA, also known as "mini-suction" and "[[menstrual extraction]]", can be used in very early pregnancy, and does not require cervical dilation. Surgical techniques are sometimes referred to as 'Suction (or surgical) Termination Of Pregnancy' (STOP). From the 15th week until approximately the 26th, [[dilation and evacuation]] (D&amp;E) is used. D&amp;E consists of opening the [[cervix]] of the uterus and emptying it using surgical instruments and suction.

''[[Dilation and curettage]]'' (D&amp;C), the second most common method of abortion, is a standard gynecological procedure performed for a variety of reasons, including examination of the uterine lining for possible malignancy, investigation of abnormal bleeding, and abortion. ''[[Curettage]]'' refers to cleaning the walls of the [[uterus]] with a [[curette]]. The [[World Health Organization]] recommends this procedure, also called ''sharp curettage,'' only when MVA is unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[World Health Organization]] |chapter=Dilatation and curettage |chapterurl=http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/impac/Procedures/Dilatetion_P61_P63.html |title=Managing Complications in Pregnancy and Childbirth: A Guide for Midwives and Doctors |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |location=Geneva |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=92-4-154587-9 |oclc=181845530 |accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other techniques must be used to induce abortion in the second [[wiktionary:trimester|trimester]]. Premature delivery can be induced with [[prostaglandin]]; this can be coupled with injecting the [[amniotic sac|amniotic fluid]] with hypertonic solutions containing [[saline (medicine)|saline]] or [[urea]]. After the 16th week of gestation, abortions can be induced by [[intact dilation and extraction]] (IDX) (also called intrauterine cranial decompression), which requires surgical decompression of the fetus's head before evacuation. IDX is sometimes called "[[partial-birth abortion]]," which has been [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|federally banned]] in the United States. A [[hysterotomy abortion]] is a procedure similar to a [[caesarean section]] and is performed under [[general anesthesia]]. It requires a smaller incision than a caesarean section and is used during later stages of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="encarta"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=McGee |first=Glenn |authorlink=Glenn McGee |coauthors=[[Jon F.

==Incidence==
The number of abortions performed worldwide has decreased between 1995 and 2003 from 45.6&amp;nbsp;million to 41.6&amp;nbsp;million (a decrease from 35 to 29 per 1000 women between 15 and 44 years of age).&lt;ref name=OBGY09/&gt;  The greatest decrease has occurred in the developed world with a decrease from 39 to 26 per 1000 women in comparison to the developing world which had a decrease from 34 to 29 per 1000 women.&lt;ref name=OBGY09/&gt;  Of these approximately 42 million abortions 22 million occurred safely and 20 million unsafely.&lt;ref name=OBGY09/&gt;

The incidence and reasons for induced abortion vary regionally.  Some countries, such as Belgium (11.2 per 1000 known pregnancies) and the Netherlands (10.6 per 1000), had a comparatively low rate of induced abortion, while others like Russia (62.6 per 1000) and Vietnam (43.7 per 1000) had a high rate. The world ratio was 26 induced abortions per 1000 known pregnancies (excluding miscarriages and stillbirths).&lt;ref&gt;Henshaw, Stanley K., Singh, Susheela, and Haas, Taylor. (1999).

Abortion rates also vary depending on the stage of pregnancy and the method practiced. In 2003, from data collected in those areas of the United States that sufficiently reported gestational age, it was found that 88.2% of abortions were conducted at or prior to 12 weeks, 10.4% from 13 to 20 weeks, and 1.4% at or after 21 weeks. 90.9% of these were classified as having been done by "[[curettage]]" ([[Suction-aspiration abortion|suction-aspiration]], [[Dilation and curettage]], [[Dilation and evacuation]]), 7.7% by "[[medical abortion|medical]]" means ([[mifepristone]]), 0.4% by "[[instillation abortion|intrauterine instillation]]" (saline or [[prostaglandin]]), and 1.0% by "other" (including [[hysterotomy abortion|hysterotomy]] and [[hysterectomy]]).&lt;ref name="cdc2003"&gt;Strauss, L.T., Gamble, S.B., Parker, W.Y, Cook, D.A., Zane, S.B., and Hamdan, S.

A 1998 aggregated study, from 27 countries, on the reasons women seek to terminate their pregnancies concluded that common factors cited to have influenced the abortion decision were: desire to delay or end childbearing, concern over the interruption of work or education, issues of financial or relationship stability, and perceived immaturity.&lt;ref name="bankole98"&gt;Bankole, Akinrinola, Singh, Susheela, and Haas, Taylor.

Some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures. These might include the stigmatization of disabled people, preference for children of a specific sex, disapproval of single motherhood, insufficient economic support for families, lack of access to or rejection of contraceptive methods, or efforts toward [[population control]] (such as China's [[one-child policy]]). These factors can sometimes result in compulsory abortion or [[sex-selective abortion]].

===Unsafe abortion===

{{Main|Unsafe abortion}}
Women seeking to terminate their pregnancies sometimes resort to unsafe methods, particularly where and when access to legal abortion is restricted.  The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) defines an unsafe abortion as being "a procedure ... carried out by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment that does not conform to minimal medical standards, or both."&lt;ref name="whounsafe"&gt;World Health Organization.

Retrieved 2009-03-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Unsafe abortions are sometimes known colloquially as "back-alley" abortions. They may be performed by [[self-induced abortion|the woman herself]], another person without medical training, or a professional health provider operating in sub-standard conditions. Unsafe abortion remains a public health concern due to the higher incidence and severity of its associated complications, such as incomplete abortion, [[sepsis]], hemorrhage, and damage to internal organs. It is estimated that 20 million unsafe abortions occur around the world annually and that 70,000 of these result in the woman's death.&lt;ref name=OBGY09/&gt;  Complications of unsafe abortion are said to account, globally, for approximately 13% of all [[maternal death|maternal mortalities]], with regional estimates including 12% in Asia, 25% in Latin America, and 13% in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Salter, C., Johnson, H.B., and Hengen, N.

The [[Hippocratic Oath]], the chief statement of [[medical ethics]] for Hippocratic physicians in [[Ancient Greece]], forbade doctors from helping to procure an abortion by [[pessary]]. [[Soranus (Greek Physician)|Soranus]], a second-century Greek [[physician]], suggested in his work ''[[Gynaecology]]'' that women wishing to abort their pregnancies should engage in energetic exercise, energetic jumping, carrying heavy objects, and riding animals.

However, the procedure remained relatively rare until the late 1960's. In late 1960's and early 1970's, due to a confluence of factors, the number of abortions exploded worldwide.

{{Main|Abortion debate}}
In the [[history of abortion]], induced abortion has been the source of considerable debate, controversy, and activism. An individual's position on the complex ethical, moral, philosophical, biological, and legal issues is often related to his or her [[value system]]. The main positions are one that argues in favor of access to abortion and one argues against access to abortion. Opinions of abortion may be described as being a combination of beliefs on its morality, and beliefs on the responsibility, ethical scope, and proper extent of governmental authorities in public policy. [[religion|Religious ethics]] also has an influence upon both personal opinion and the greater debate over abortion (see [[religion and abortion]]).

Abortion debates, especially pertaining to [[abortion law]]s, are often spearheaded by groups advocating one of these two positions. In the United States, those in favor of greater legal restrictions on, or even complete prohibition of abortion, most often describe themselves as pro-life while those against legal restrictions on abortion describe themselves as pro-choice. Generally, the former position argues that a human fetus is a human being with a [[right to life|right to live]] making abortion tantamount to murder. The latter position argues that a woman has certain [[reproductive rights]], especially the choice whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term.

In both public and private debate, arguments presented in favor of or against abortion access focus on either the moral permissibility of an induced abortion, or justification of laws permitting or restricting abortion.

Debate also focuses on whether the pregnant woman should have to notify and/or have the consent of others in distinct cases: a [[minor (law)|minor]], her parents; a legally married or [[common-law marriage|common-law]] wife, her husband; or a pregnant woman, the biological father. In a 2003 Gallup poll in the United States, 79% of male and 67% of female respondents were in favor of legalized mandatory spousal notification; overall support was 72% with 26% opposed.&lt;ref&gt;The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.

Our earliest secular laws regulating abortion reflect a concern with class and caste purity and preservation of male prerogatives. Abortion as such was not outlawed, but wives who procured abortions without their husband's knowledge could be severely punished, as could slaves who induced abortions in highborn women. Generally, abortions prior to [[quickening]] were treated as minor crimes, if at all. 

The new philosophies of the [[Axial Age]], which began discussing the nature and value of human life in abstract terms, had little impact on existing abortion laws. Even the Christian [[ecclesiastical courts]] of the Middle Ages imposed penance and no corporal punishment for abortion, and retained the pre- and post-quickening distinction from the ancient philosophies.

This was part of a larger struggle on the part of the medical profession to distinguish modern, theory based medicine from traditional, empirically based medicine, including midwifery and herbalism.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of New York State'' Book 12, Chapter 13, Part 3, Editor, Dr. James Sullivan available at [http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/state/historyofnewyorkstate/bk12/ch13/pt3.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Union, with legislation in 1920, and [[Iceland]], with legislation in 1935, were two of the first countries to generally allow abortion. The second half of the 20th century saw the liberalization of abortion laws in other countries. The ''[[Abortion Act 1967]]'' allowed abortion for limited reasons in the United Kingdom (except Northern Ireland). In the 1973 case, ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] struck down state laws banning abortion, ruling that such laws violated an implied [[right to privacy]] in the [[United States Constitution]]. The [[Supreme Court of Canada]], similarly, in the case of ''[[R. v. Morgentaler]]'', discarded its criminal code regarding abortion in 1988, after ruling that such restrictions violated the security of person guaranteed to women under the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''. Canada later struck down provincial regulations of abortion in the case of ''[[R. v. Morgentaler (1993)]].'' By contrast, [[Abortion in the Republic of Ireland|abortion in Ireland]] was affected by the addition of an [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|amendment]] to the Irish [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution]] in 1983 by popular referendum, recognizing "the right to life of the unborn".

Current laws pertaining to abortion are diverse. Religious, moral, and cultural sensibilities continue to influence abortion laws throughout the world. The right to life, the right to liberty, the right to [[security of person]], and the right to [[reproductive rights|reproductive health]] are major issues of human rights that are sometimes used as justification for the existence or absence of laws controlling abortion. Many countries in which abortion is legal require that certain criteria be met in order for an abortion to be obtained, often, but not always, using a trimester-based system to regulate the window of legality:
*In the United States, some states impose a 24-hour waiting period before the procedure, prescribe the distribution of information on [[prenatal development|fetal development]], or require that [[minors and abortion|parents be contacted]] if their minor daughter requests an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawserver.com/abortion Interactive maps comparing U.S. abortion restrictions by state] LawServer.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the United Kingdom, as in some other countries, two doctors must first certify that an abortion is medically or socially necessary before it can be performed.
*In Canada, a similar requirement was rejected as unconstitutional in 1988.

Other countries, in which abortion is normally illegal, will allow one to be performed in the case of rape, incest, or danger to the pregnant woman's life or health.
*A few nations ban abortion entirely: [[Abortion in Chile|Chile]], [[Abortion in El Salvador|El Salvador]], [[Abortion in Malta|Malta]], and [[Abortion in Nicaragua|Nicaragua]], with consequent rises in maternal death directly and indirectly due to pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=European delegation visits Nicaragua to examine effects of abortion ban |date=November 26, 2007 |publisher=Ipas |accessdate=2009-06-15| url=http://www.ipas.org/Library/News/News_Items/European_delegation_visits_Nicaragua_to_examine_effects_of_abortion_ban.aspx }} "More than 82 maternal deaths had been  registered in Nicaragua since the change.

In places where abortion is illegal or carries heavy social stigma, pregnant women may engage in [[medical tourism]] and travel to countries where they can terminate their pregnancies. Women without the means to travel can resort to providers of illegal abortions or try to do it themselves.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Need Abortion, Will Travel |author=Marcy Bloom |date=February 25, 2008 |publisher=RH Reality Check |accessdate=2009-06-15| url=http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/blog/2008/02/25/need-abortion-will-travel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, about 8% of abortions are performed on women who travel from another state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=United States: Percentage of Legal Abortions Obtained by Out-of-State Residents, 2005 |publisher=The Kaiser Family Foundation |accessdate=2009-06-14| url=http://www.statehealthfacts.kff.org/profileind.jsp?rgn=1&amp;cat=10&amp;ind=467}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that is driven at least partly by differing limits on abortion according to gestational age or the scarcity of doctors trained and willing to do later abortions.

===Sex-selective===
{{Main|Sex-selective abortion}}

[[Medical ultrasonography|Sonography]] and [[amniocentesis]] allow parents to determine sex before childbirth. The development of this technology has led to [[sex-selective abortion and female infanticide|sex-selective abortion]], or the targeted termination of female fetuses.

It is suggested that sex-selective abortion might be partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the birth rates of male and female children in some places. The preference for male children is reported in many areas of Asia, and abortion used to limit female births has been reported in China, Taiwan, South Korea, and India.&lt;ref&gt;Banister, Judith.

In India, the economic role of men, the costs associated with [[dowry|dowries]], and a common Indian tradition which dictates that [[funeral|funeral rites]] must be performed by a male relative have led to a cultural preference for sons.&lt;ref&gt;Mutharayappa, Rangamuthia, Kim Choe, Minja, Arnold, Fred, and Roy, T.K.

In the People's Republic of China, there is also a historic son preference.

Various options and realities of abortion have been dramatized in film. In ''[[Riding in Cars with Boys]]'' (2001) an underage woman carries her pregnancy to term as abortion is not an affordable option, moves in with the father and finds herself involved with drugs, has no opportunities, and questioning if she loves her child. While in ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'' (2007) a 16-year-old initially goes to have an abortion but decides to bear the child and allow a wealthy couple to adopt it. Other films ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'' (1987) and ''[[If These Walls Could Talk]]'' (1996) explore the availability, affordability and dangers of illegal abortions. The emotional impact of dealing with an unwanted pregnancy alone is the focus of ''Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her'' (2000) and ''[[Circle of Friends (1995 film)|Circle of Friends]]'' (1995). As a marriage was in trouble in the ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974) [[Kay Adams-Corleone|Kay]] knew the relationship was over when she aborted "a son" in secret.&lt;ref name="TheGodfather"&gt;{{Cite web

==In other animals==
{{See|Miscarriage#In other animals}}
Spontaneous abortion occurs in various animals. For example, in sheep, it may be caused by crowding through doors, or being chased by dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, James. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=RXMuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=abortion+and+husbandry&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WjmvGj-fB2&amp;sig=8qH_WrPR08YEwPKr_c6PHDUOMmQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=erDbSeSVBoz4MY-F7M4I&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#PPA124,M1 Sheep Husbandry in Canada]'', p. 124 (1911).&lt;/ref&gt; In cows, abortion may be caused by contagious disease, such as [[Brucellosis]] or [[Campylobacter]], but can often be controlled by vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/B/BeefCattleAndBeefProduction/ManagementAndHusbandryOfBeefCattle/en "Beef cattle and Beef production: Management and Husbandry of Beef Cattle”], ''Encyclopaedia of New Zealand'' (1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

Abortion may also be induced in animals, in the context of [[animal husbandry]]. For example, abortion may be induced in mares that have been mated improperly, or that have been purchased by owners who did not realize the mares were pregnant, or that are pregnant with twin foals.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, Angus et al. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=jlZAT-9VwUIC&amp;pg=PA563&amp;lpg=PA563&amp;dq=%22induce+abortion%22+and+husbandry&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6T9w3LtpsI&amp;sig=aEYDFpnMIbLaKlstxK1MGK2rxwQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eLTbSY7EO5muMrXUkMkI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7 Equine Reproduction]'', p. 563 (Wiley-Blackwell 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feticide]] can occur in horses and zebras due to male harassment of pregnant mares or forced copulation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berger|first=Joel W|date=5 May 1983|title=Induced abortion and social factors in wild horses|journal=Nature|location=London|volume=303|pages=59–61|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v303/n5912/abs/303059a0.html|doi=10.1038/303059a0|pmid=6682487|issue=5912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pluháček|first=Jan|year=2000|title=Male infanticide in captive plains zebra, Equus burchelli|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=59|pages=689–694|url=http://af.czu.cz/~bartos/publications/pdf/Pluhacek_Bartos_2000_AB.pdf|doi=10.1006/anbe.1999.1371|pmid=10792924|last2=Bartos|first2=L|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pluháček|first=Jan|year=2005|title=Further evidence for male infanticide and feticide in captive plains zebra, Equus burchelli|journal=Folia Zool.|volume=54|issue=3|pages= 258–262|url=http://www.ivb.cz/folia/54/3/258-262.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the frequency in the wild has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=JW|first=Fitzpatrick|date=October 1991|title=Changes in herd stallions among feral horse bands and the absence of forced copulation and induced abortion |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin/Heidelberg|volume=29|issue=3|pages=217–219|issn=0340-5443 (Print) 1432-0762 (Online)|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/k1543n1548987255/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male [[Gray langur]] monkeys may attack females following male takeover, causing miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Agoramoorthy |first=G.|date=August 1988|title=Abortions in free ranging Hanuman langurs (Presbytis entellus)—a male induced strategy?|journal=Human Evolution|publisher=Springer|location=Netherlands|volume=3|issue=4|pages=297–308|issn=0393-9375 (Print) 1824-310X (Online)|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/324g107410293474/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
