'''Genderqueer''' ('''GQ'''; alternatively '''non-binary''') is a catch-all term for [[Gender identity|gender identities]] other than man and woman, thus outside of the [[gender binary]] and [[heteronormativity]].&lt;ref&gt;Usher, Raven. ''North American Lexicon of Transgender Terms''. San Francisco: GLB Publishers, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; People who identify as genderqueer may think of themselves as one or more of the following:
* both man and woman ([[bigender]], [[pangender]]);
* neither man nor woman ([[genderless]], agender);
* moving between genders (genderfluid);&lt;ref&gt;Winter, Claire R. ''Understanding Transgender Diversity: A Sensible Explanation of Sexual and Gender Identities''. CreateSpace, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[third gender]] or other-gendered; includes those who do not place a name to their gender;&lt;ref&gt;Beemyn, Brett Genny, "[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/genderqueer.html Genderqueer]", "glbtq: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual,Transgender, and Queer Culture". 2008. Retrieved April 16 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* having an overlap of, or blurred lines between, gender identity and sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Stringer, JAC, "[http://www.genderqueercoalition.org/terms GenderQueer and Queer Terms]", "Trans &amp; Queer Wellness Initiative". 2009.

Some genderqueer people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlgja.org/resources/stylebook_english.html#T |title=Stylebook Supplement on LGBT Terminology transgender (adj.) |work=National Lesbian &amp; Gay Journalists Association website |accessdate=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender |title=GLAAD Media Reference Guide Transgender Glossary of Terms |work=Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation website |accessdate=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; also identify as [[transgender]], and may or may not wish for physical modification or hormones to suit their preferred expression. Many genderqueer people see gender and sex as separable aspects of a person and sometimes identify as a male woman, a female man, or a male/female/[[intersex]] genderqueer person.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Reuben ''More T Vicar? My experiences as a genderqueer person of faith'', published in ''All God's Children'', the magazine of the LGCM, December 2010 vol 2.3&lt;/ref&gt; Gender identity is defined as one's internal sense of being male, female, both, or neither, while sexual identity refers to an individual's enduring physical, romantic, and/or emotional attraction to others.&lt;ref&gt;Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.

Retrieved on 2011-03-01.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, genderqueer people may be a variety of sexual orientations, as with transgender and [[cisgender]] people. Genderqueer identification may also occur for political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Sycamore, Mattilda B. ''Nobody Passes: Rejecting the Rules of Gender and Conformity''. Emeryville, CA: Seal Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stryker, Susan. ''Transgender History''. Berkeley, CA: Seal Press, 2008. &lt;/ref&gt;

"Genderqueer", in addition to being an umbrella term, has been used as an adjective to refer to any people who transgress distinctions of gender, regardless of their self-defined gender identity, i.e. those who "[[queer]]" gender, expressing it non-normatively.&lt;ref&gt;Dahir, Mubarak. "Whose Movement Is It?" Editorial. ''The Advocate'' 25 May 1999: 52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Androgynous]] is frequently used as a descriptive term for people in this category, though genderqueer people may express a combination of masculinity and femininity, or neither, in their [[gender variance|gender expression]] and not all identify as androgynes. However, the term has been applied by those describing what they see as a gender ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;Girshick, Lori B. ''Transgender Voices: Beyond Women and Men''. Hanover: University Press of New England, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender and pronouns==
Some genderqueer people prefer to use [[gender-neutral pronoun]]s such as [[one (pronoun)|one]], [[Wiktionary:ze|ze]], [[Wiktionary:sie|sie]], [[Wiktionary:hir|hir]], [[Spivak pronouns|ey]] or [[singular they|singular "they","their" and "them"]], while others prefer the conventional binary pronouns [[gender-specific pronoun|"her" or "him"]]. Some genderqueer people prefer to be referred to alternately as he and she (and/or gender neutral pronouns), and some prefer to use only their name and not use pronouns at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feinberg |first=L. |title=Transgender warriors: Making History from Joan of Arc to Dennis Rodman |publisher=Beacon |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;
