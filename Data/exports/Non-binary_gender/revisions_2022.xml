The term ''genderqueer'' originated in [[queer]] [[zine]]s of the 1980s as a precursor to the term ''non-binary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hendrie |editor1-first=Theo |title=X Marks the Spot: An Anthology of Nonbinary Experiences |date=2019 |isbn=978-1-0809-6803-9 |page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gained wider use in the 1990s among political activists,&lt;ref name="Tobia"/&gt; especially [[Riki Wilchins|Riki Anne Wilchins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wilchins |first1=Riki |title=Get to Know the New Pronouns: They, Theirs, and Them |url=https://www.pride.com/identities/2017/3/14/get-know-new-pronouns-they-theirs-and-them |website=Pride |language=en |date=14 March 2017 |access-date=18 February 2020 |archive-date=18 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200218052059/https://www.pride.com/identities/2017/3/14/get-know-new-pronouns-they-theirs-and-them |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilchins used the term in a 1995 essay published in the first issue of ''In Your Face'' to describe anyone who is [[gender nonconforming]], and identified as genderqueer in their 1997 autobiography.&lt;ref name="genderqueerid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genderqueerid.com/gqhistory|title=Genderqueer History|access-date=2 November 2018|archive-date=12 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112060956/http://genderqueerid.com/gqhistory|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilchins |first1=Riki |title=A Note from your Editrix |journal=In Your Face |date=Spring 1995 |issue=1 |page=4 |url=http://www.gendertalk.com/pubs/InYourFace1.pdf |access-date=18 February 2020 |archive-date=5 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201005123140/http://www.gendertalk.com/pubs/InYourFace1.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilchins was also one of the main contributors to the anthology ''Genderqueer: Voices Beyond the Sexual Binary'' published in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=GenderQueer : voices from beyond the sexual binary|publisher=[[Alyson Books]]|location=New York City|isbn=978-1-55583-730-3|editor-last1=Nestle|editor-first1=Joan|editor-last2=Howell|editor-first2=Clare|editor-last3=Wilchins|editor-first3=Riki Anne|edition=1st|oclc=50389309|year=2002|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781555837303}}&lt;/ref&gt; The internet allowed the term ''genderqueer'' to spread even further than zines, and by the 2010s the term was introduced to the mainstream via celebrities who publicly identified under the ''genderqueer'' umbrella.&lt;ref name="Tobia"/&gt;

People who challenge binary social constructions of gender often self-identify as ''genderqueer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's voices, feminist visions : classic and contemporary readings|isbn=978-0-07-802700-0|edition=Sixth|location=New York|oclc=862041473|last1 = Shaw|first1 = Susan|last2=Lee|first2=Janet|date=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2021}} In addition an umbrella term for non-binary gender identities, ''genderqueer'' has been used as an adjective to refer to people who are perceived to transcend or diverge from traditional distinctions of gender, regardless of their gender identity.

The term ''genderqueer'' has also been applied by those describing what they see as gender ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Transgender Voices: Beyond Women and Men |last=Girshick |first=Lori B. |year=2008 |publisher=[[University Press of New England]] |location=[[Hanover, New Hampshire]] |isbn=978-1-58465-645-6 |oclc=183162406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2021}} [[Androgyny|Androgynous]] (also ''[[androgyne]]'') is frequently used as a descriptive term for people in this category.

==Legal recognition==
{{main|Legal recognition of non-binary gender}}
Many non-binary/genderqueer people use the gender they were given at birth to conduct everyday business, as many institutions and forms of identification—such as passports and driver's licenses—only accept, in the sense of recorded recognition, binary gender identities. But with the increasing acceptance of non-binary gender identities and the rise in wider societal recognition, this is slowly changing, as more governments and institutions recognize and allow non-binary identities.&lt;ref name=richardsetal&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Richards|first1=Christina|last2=Bouman|first2=Walter Pierre|last3=Seal|first3=Leighton|last4=Barker|first4=Meg John|last5=Nieder|first5=Timo O.|last6=T'Sjoen|first6=Guy|date=2016|title=Non-binary or genderqueer genders|journal=International Review of Psychiatry|volume=28|issue=1|pages=95–102|pmid=26753630|doi=10.3109/09540261.2015.1106446|s2cid=29985722|url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/7279758|access-date=9 June 2019|archive-date=26 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626224658/https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/7279758|url-status=live|hdl=1854/LU-7279758|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple countries legally recognize non-binary or [[third gender]] classifications. Some non-Western societies have long recognized transgender people as a third gender, though this may not (or may only recently)&lt;ref name=BBC-20091223&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistani eunuchs to have distinct gender|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8428819.stm|date=23 December 2009|work=BBC News|access-date=2009-12-23|archive-date=18 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200518094705/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8428819.stm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; include formal legal recognition.

In the U.S., most respondents to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey chose "A gender not listed here". The "not listed here" respondents were nine percentage points (33%) more likely to report forgoing healthcare due to fear of discrimination than the general sample (36% compared to 27%). Ninety percent reported experiencing anti-trans bias at work, and 43% reported having attempted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/release_materials/agendernotlistedhere.pdf |title=A Gender Not Listed Here: Genderqueers, Gender Rebels, and OtherWise in the National Transgender Discrimination Survey |author-last=Harrison |author-first=Jack |author2-last=Grant |author2-first=Jaime |author3-last=Herman |author3-first=Jody L. |access-date=29 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725182217/http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/release_materials/agendernotlistedhere.pdf |archive-date=25 July 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reported discrimination non-binary people face includes disregard, disbelief, condescending interactions, and disrespect.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Non-binary people are also often viewed as partaking in a trend and thus deemed insincere or attention-seeking. As an accumulation, erasure is often a significant form of discrimination non-binary people face.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[Misgendering]], intentional or not, is also a problem that many face. In the case of intentional misgendering, [[transphobia]] is a driving force. Additionally, the use of [[they/them pronouns]] is lumped into the larger, controversial, subject of [[safe space]]s and [[political correctness]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFJDDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Cf.+S.+Bear+Bergman+&amp;pg=PR5|title=Genderqueer and Non-Binary Genders|last1=Richards|first1=Christina|last2=Bouman|first2=Walter Pierre|last3=Barker|first3=Meg-John|year=2017|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-137-51053-2|language=en|access-date=19 October 2020|archive-date=2 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210302223320/https://books.google.com/books?id=qFJDDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Cf.+S.+Bear+Bergman+&amp;pg=PR5|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing pushback and intentional misgendering by some people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Misgendering |url=https://www.californialawreview.org/print/misgendering/ |access-date=2022-11-11 |website=California Law Review |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Report of the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey'', 35% of the nearly 28,000 transgender respondents to the anonymous online survey identified as non-binary.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{Cite news|first=William|last=Cummings|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/06/21/third-gender-option-non-binary/359260001/|title=When asked their sex, some are going with option 'X'|date=21 June 2017|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=30 January 2019|language=en-US|archive-date=4 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204221755/https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/06/21/third-gender-option-non-binary/359260001/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="survey2015"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Report of the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey |url=http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS%20Full%20Report%20-%20FINAL%201.6.17.pdf |publisher=National Center for Transgender Equality |access-date=30 May 2019 |page=45 |date=2016 |archive-date=9 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509014637/http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS%20Full%20Report%20-%20FINAL%201.6.17.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In April 2022, [[Statistics Canada]] released findings from the [[2021 Canadian census|2021 census]], making Canada the first country to ask a core question about gender identity, and found that 41,355 Canadians aged 15 and over identified as nonbinary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Easton |first=Rob |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/census-data-trans-non-binary-statscan-1.6431928 |title='Historic' census data sheds light on number of trans and non-binary people for first time |work=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=2022-04-27 |accessdate=2022-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2019 survey of the Two-Spirit and LGBTQ+ population in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], called ''Mapping the Void: Two-Spirit and LGBTQ+ Experiences in Hamilton'' showed that 19% of the 906 respondents identified as non-binary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mapping the Void: Two-Spirit and LGBTQ+ Experiences in Hamilton|url=https://labourstudies.mcmaster.ca/documents/mappingthevoid.pdf|access-date=19 July 2019|date=11 Jun 2019|archive-date=3 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190703192933/https://labourstudies.mcmaster.ca/documents/mappingthevoid.pdf|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 survey of Canadian LGBT+ people called ''LGBT+ Realities Survey'' found that 4% of the 1,897 respondents identified as non-binary transgender and 1% identified as non-binary outside of the transgender umbrella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The values, needs and realities of LGBT people in Canada in 2017|url=https://fondationjasminroy.com/en/initiative/lgbt-realities-survey/|access-date=27 July 2019|date=2017|archive-date=27 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727230336/https://fondationjasminroy.com/en/initiative/lgbt-realities-survey/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2021 survey found that 0.4% of adults in [[Switzerland]] describe themselves as non-binary.&lt;ref name="swi2021"&gt;{{cite web |title=Only 0.4% of Swiss residents describe themselves as non-binary |url=https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/only-0.4--of-swiss-residents-describe-themselves-as-non-binary/47224644 |website=SWI swissinfo.ch |access-date=6 January 2022 |language=en |date=29 December 2021 |archive-date=6 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220106225359/https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/only-0.4--of-swiss-residents-describe-themselves-as-non-binary/47224644 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey of 2,690 Swiss residents was weighted to be reflective of the entire population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Geschlechtergerechter: Studie #1 Geschlecht und Identität |url=https://dev.geschlechtergerechter.ch/assets/tour/GG-Studie-1-Sperrfrist-28.12.-17-Uhr.pdf |publisher=Sotomo |access-date=6 January 2022 |date=December 2021 |page=5 |archive-date=28 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211228162619/https://dev.geschlechtergerechter.ch/assets/tour/GG-Studie-1-Sperrfrist-28.12.-17-Uhr.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
A 2011 survey conducted by the [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] in the UK found that 0.4% of the 10,039 respondents identified as non-binary. It does not allow inference about the share of non-binary people in the whole population, since the survey sample was not necessarily representative. The purpose of the survey was to test if respondents are willing to answer questions about their transsexual status.&lt;ref name="ehrc2012"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Glen |first1=Fiona |last2=Hurrell |first2=Karen |title=Technical note: Measuring Gender Identity |url=https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/sites/default/files/technical_note_final.pdf |publisher=Equality and Human Rights Commission |access-date=30 May 2019 |date=2012 |archive-date=2 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190802101054/https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/sites/default/files/technical_note_final.pdf |url-status=live |pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
According to a 2021 study by the [[Williams Institute]], an estimated 1.2 million American adults aged between 18 and 60 identify as non-binary, making up 11% of the LGBTQ population in that age bracket.&lt;ref name="WilsonMeyer"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wilson |first1=Bianca D.M. |last2=Meyer |first2=Ilan H. |title=Nonbinary LGBTQ Adults in the United States |url=https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/nonbinary-lgbtq-adults-us/ |publisher=Williams Institute |access-date=25 June 2021 |date=June 2021 |archive-date=24 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624192051/https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/nonbinary-lgbtq-adults-us/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2020 survey by [[The Trevor Project]] found that 26% of LGBTQ youth (ages 13–24) in the U.S. identify as non-binary.&lt;ref name="Ennis2021"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ennis |first1=Dawn |title=New Research Reveals Insights Into America's Nonbinary Youth |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawnstaceyennis/2021/07/13/new-research-reveals-insights-into-americas-nonbinary-youth/ |access-date=6 January 2022 |work=[[Forbes]] |date=13 July 2021 |language=en |archive-date=6 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220106234315/https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawnstaceyennis/2021/07/13/new-research-reveals-insights-into-americas-nonbinary-youth/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Diversity of Nonbinary Youth |url=https://www.thetrevorproject.org/research-briefs/diversity-of-nonbinary-youth/ |website=The Trevor Project |access-date=6 January 2022 |date=13 July 2021 |archive-date=6 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220106234323/https://www.thetrevorproject.org/research-briefs/diversity-of-nonbinary-youth/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
