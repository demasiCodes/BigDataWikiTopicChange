The term ''genderqueer'' originated in [[queer]] [[zine]]s of the 1980s as a precursor to the term ''non-binary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hendrie |editor1-first=Theo |title=X Marks the Spot: An Anthology of Nonbinary Experiences |date=2019 |isbn=978-1-0809-6803-9 |page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gained wider use in the 1990s among political activists,&lt;ref name="Tobia"/&gt; especially [[Riki Wilchins|Riki Anne Wilchins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wilchins |first1=Riki |title=Get to Know the New Pronouns: They, Theirs, and Them |url=https://www.pride.com/identities/2017/3/14/get-know-new-pronouns-they-theirs-and-them |website=Pride |language=en |date=14 March 2017 |access-date=18 February 2020 |archive-date=18 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200218052059/https://www.pride.com/identities/2017/3/14/get-know-new-pronouns-they-theirs-and-them |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilchins used the term in a 1995 essay published in the first issue of ''In Your Face'' to describe anyone who is [[gender nonconforming]], and identified as genderqueer in their 1997 autobiography.&lt;ref name="genderqueerid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genderqueerid.com/gqhistory|title=Genderqueer History|access-date=2 November 2018|archive-date=12 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112060956/http://genderqueerid.com/gqhistory|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilchins |first1=Riki |title=A Note from your Editrix |journal=In Your Face |date=Spring 1995 |issue=1 |page=4 |url=http://www.gendertalk.com/pubs/InYourFace1.pdf |access-date=18 February 2020 |archive-date=5 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201005123140/http://www.gendertalk.com/pubs/InYourFace1.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilchins was also one of the main contributors to the anthology ''Genderqueer: Voices Beyond the Sexual Binary'' published in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=GenderQueer : voices from beyond the sexual binary|publisher=[[Alyson Books]]|location=New York City|isbn=978-1-55583-730-3|editor-last1=Nestle|editor-first1=Joan|editor-last2=Howell|editor-first2=Clare|editor-last3=Wilchins|editor-first3=Riki Anne|edition=1st|oclc=50389309|year=2002|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781555837303}}&lt;/ref&gt; The internet allowed the term ''genderqueer'' to spread even further than zines, and by the 2010s the term was introduced to the mainstream via celebrities who publicly identified under the ''genderqueer'' umbrella.&lt;ref name="Tobia"/&gt;

People who challenge binary social constructions of gender often self-identify as ''genderqueer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's voices, feminist visions : classic and contemporary readings|isbn=978-0-07-802700-0|edition=Sixth|location=New York|oclc=862041473|last1 = Shaw|first1 = Susan|last2=Lee|first2=Janet|date=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2021}} In addition an umbrella term for non-binary gender identities, ''genderqueer'' has been used as an adjective to refer to people who are perceived to transcend or diverge from traditional distinctions of gender, regardless of their gender identity. People may express gender non-normatively by not conforming into the binary gender categories of "man" and "woman".&lt;!--Is this in terms of identity label, appearance and presentation, or both?--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Dahir |first=Mubarak |date=25 May 1999 |title=Whose Movement Is It? |magazine=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |page=52 |publisher=[[Here Media]]|location=San Francisco, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''genderqueer'' has also been applied by those describing what they see as gender ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Transgender Voices: Beyond Women and Men |last=Girshick |first=Lori B. |year=2008 |publisher=[[University Press of New England]] |location=[[Hanover, New Hampshire]] |isbn=978-1-58465-645-6 |oclc=183162406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2021}} [[Androgyny|Androgynous]] (also ''[[androgyne]]'') is frequently used as a descriptive term for people in this category. This is because the term ''androgyny'' is closely associated with a blend of socially defined masculine and feminine traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Voices, Feminist Visions|last1=Shaw|first1=Susan M.|last2=Lee|first2=Janet|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Education]]|year=2015|edition=6|location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2021}} But not all genderqueer people identify as androgynous.

A 2015 National Center for Transgender Equality study surveyed nearly 28,000 transgender people in the [[United States]], 35% of whom identified as non-binary or genderqueer. 84% of respondents reported using pronouns that did not match the gender given on their birth certificates. 37% of respondents preferred he/him, 37% preferred she/her, and 29% preferred they/them. 20% of respondents did not ask others to use certain pronouns to refer to them, and 4% used pronouns not given in the survey choices.&lt;ref&gt;https://transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS%20Full%20Report%20-%20FINAL%201.6.17.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal recognition==
{{main|Legal recognition of non-binary gender}}
Many non-binary/genderqueer people use the gender they were given at birth to conduct everyday business, as many institutions and forms of identification‚Äîsuch as passports and driver's licenses‚Äîonly accept, in the sense of recorded recognition, binary gender identities. But with the increasing acceptance of non-binary gender identities and the rise in wider societal recognition, this is slowly changing, as more governments and institutions recognize and allow non-binary identities.&lt;ref name=richardsetal&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Richards|first1=Christina|last2=Bouman|first2=Walter Pierre|last3=Seal|first3=Leighton|last4=Barker|first4=Meg John|last5=Nieder|first5=Timo O.|last6=T'Sjoen|first6=Guy|date=2016|title=Non-binary or genderqueer genders|journal=International Review of Psychiatry|volume=28|issue=1|pages=95‚Äì102|pmid=26753630|doi=10.3109/09540261.2015.1106446|s2cid=29985722|url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/7279758|access-date=9 June 2019|archive-date=26 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626224658/https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/7279758|url-status=live|hdl=1854/LU-7279758|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple countries legally recognize non-binary or [[third gender]] classifications. Some non-Western societies have long recognized transgender people as a third gender, though this may not (or may only recently)&lt;ref name=BBC-20091223&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistani eunuchs to have distinct gender|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8428819.stm|date=23 December 2009|work=BBC News|access-date=2009-12-23|archive-date=18 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200518094705/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8428819.stm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; include formal legal recognition. In Western societies, Australia may have been the first country to legally recognize a classification of sex outside of "male" and "female" on legal documentation, with the recognition of [[Alex MacFarlane]]'s intersex status in 2003.&lt;ref name="asa"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.asanet.org/sectionsex/documents/SUMMER03sexnews.pdf | title = Newsletter of the Sociology of Sexualities Section of the American Sociological Association | journal = American Sociological Association Sexualities News | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | date = Summer 2003 | access-date = 9 December 2013 | archive-date = 4 March 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054219/http://www.asanet.org/sectionsex/documents/SUMMER03sexnews.pdf | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The wider legal recognition of non-binary people‚Äîfollowing the recognition of intersex people in 2003‚Äîin Australian law followed between 2010 and 2014, with legal action taken against the [[New South Wales Government]] Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages by transgender activist [[Norrie May-Welby]] to recognize Norrie's legal gender identity as "non-specific".

==Discrimination==
{{Main|Discrimination against non-binary people}}
Various countries throughout history have criminalized transgender and non-binary gender identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Wareham|first=Jamie|title=New Report Shows Where It's Illegal To Be Transgender In 2020|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiewareham/2020/09/30/this-is-where-its-illegal-to-be-transgender-in-2020/|access-date=2021-04-30|website=Forbes|language=en|archive-date=30 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210430203254/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiewareham/2020/09/30/this-is-where-its-illegal-to-be-transgender-in-2020/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2017-09-28 |title=Trans Legal Mapping Report |url=https://ilga.org/trans-legal-mapping-report |access-date=2022-07-14 |website=ILGA |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., most respondents to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey chose "A gender not listed here". The "not listed here" respondents were nine percentage points (33%) more likely to report forgoing healthcare due to fear of discrimination than the general sample (36% compared to 27%). Ninety percent reported experiencing anti-trans bias at work, and 43% reported having attempted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/release_materials/agendernotlistedhere.pdf |title=A Gender Not Listed Here: Genderqueers, Gender Rebels, and OtherWise in the National Transgender Discrimination Survey |author-last=Harrison |author-first=Jack |author2-last=Grant |author2-first=Jaime |author3-last=Herman |author3-first=Jody L. |access-date=29 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725182217/http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/release_materials/agendernotlistedhere.pdf |archive-date=25 July 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reported discrimination non-binary people face includes disregard, disbelief, condescending interactions, and disrespect.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Non-binary people are also often viewed as partaking in a trend and thus deemed insincere or attention-seeking. As an accumulation, erasure is often a significant form of discrimination non-binary people face.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[Misgendering]], intentional or not, is also a problem that many face. In the case of intentional misgendering, [[transphobia]] is a driving force. Additionally, the use of [[they/them pronouns]] is lumped into the larger, controversial, subject of [[safe space]]s and [[political correctness]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFJDDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Cf.+S.+Bear+Bergman+&amp;pg=PR5|title=Genderqueer and Non-Binary Genders|last1=Richards|first1=Christina|last2=Bouman|first2=Walter Pierre|last3=Barker|first3=Meg-John|year=2017|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-137-51053-2|language=en|access-date=19 October 2020|archive-date=2 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210302223320/https://books.google.com/books?id=qFJDDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Cf.+S.+Bear+Bergman+&amp;pg=PR5|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing pushback and intentional misgendering by some people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Misgendering |url=https://www.californialawreview.org/print/misgendering/ |access-date=2022-11-11 |website=California Law Review |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-binary and transgender identifying people also face discrimination in sports participation. Non-binary identifying athletes have an immediate barrier as most sports competitions are divided into men's and women's categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Erikainen |first1=Sonja |last2=Vincent |first2=Ben |last3=Hopkins |first3=Al |date=9 October 2020 |title=Specific Detriment: Barriers and Opportunities for Non-Binary Inclusive Sports in Scotland |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0193723520962937 |journal=[[Journal of Sport &amp; Social Issues]] |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=75‚Äì102 |doi=10.1177/0193723520962937 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many flags have been used in non-binary and genderqueer communities to represent various identities. There are distinct non-binary and genderqueer pride flags. The genderqueer pride flag was designed in 2011 by Marilyn Roxie. Lavender represents androgyny or queerness, white represents agender identity, and green represents those whose identities which are defined outside the binary.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|first=Lynn|last=Deater|url=http://ncccommuter.org/he-she-or-they/|title=He, She or They? ¬ª The Commuter|website=ncccommuter.org|access-date=20 December 2016|date=29 April 2015|archive-date=21 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221090439/http://ncccommuter.org/he-she-or-they/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/Flags%2520and%2520Symbols.pdf|title=Flags and Symbols |publisher=[[Amherst College]]|location=Amherst, Massachusetts|access-date=20 December 2016|archive-date=10 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510154054/https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/Flags%2520and%2520Symbols.pdf|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.davidmariner.com/flags/|title=Gender and Sexuality Awareness Flags|date=2015-10-26|newspaper=David Mariner|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-20|archive-date=3 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203153557/http://www.davidmariner.com/flags/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-binary pride flag was created in 2014 by Kye Rowan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://letsqueerthingsup.com/2015/03/15/8-things-non-binary-people-need-to-know/|title=8 Things Non-Binary People Need to Know|date=2015-03-15|website=Let's Queer Things Up!|access-date=2016-12-20|archive-date=22 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222123705/https://letsqueerthingsup.com/2015/03/15/8-things-non-binary-people-need-to-know/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yellow represents people whose gender exists outside the binary, purple represents those whose gender is a mixture of‚Äîor between‚Äîmale and female, black represents people who have no gender, and white represents those who embrace many or all genders.&lt;ref name="nbflagtumblr"&gt;{{cite web |title=After counting up all the 'votes' for each variation of my nonbinary flag (to be separate from the genderqueer flag), it seems this is the most loved!

Genderfluid people, who fall under the genderqueer umbrella, also have their own flag. Pink represents femininity, white represents lack of gender, purple represents mixed gender or androgyny, black represents all other genders, and blue represents masculinity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2016/09/gender-fluid-added-oxford-english-dictionary/|title=Gender-fluid added to the Oxford English Dictionary|newspaper=LGBTQ Nation|access-date=2016-12-20|archive-date=25 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025023342/http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2016/09/gender-fluid-added-oxford-english-dictionary/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agender people, who also sometimes identify as genderqueer, have their own flag. This flag uses black and white stripes to represent an absence of gender, and a green stripe to represent non-binary genders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Manzella |first=Samantha |url=http://www.newnownext.com/guide-lgbt-flags/07/2017/ |title=Beyond The Rainbow: Your Guide To LGBT Flags |publisher=NewNowNext |date=2017-10-07 |access-date=2018-06-25 |archive-date=25 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625075216/http://www.newnownext.com/guide-lgbt-flags/07/2017/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In April 2022, [[Statistics Canada]] released findings from the [[2021 Canadian census|2021 census]], making Canada the first country to ask a core question about gender identity, and found that 41,355 Canadians aged 15 and over identified as nonbinary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Easton |first=Rob |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/census-data-trans-non-binary-statscan-1.6431928 |title='Historic' census data sheds light on number of trans and non-binary people for first time |work=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=2022-04-27 |accessdate=2022-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2019 survey of the Two-Spirit and LGBTQ+ population in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], called ''Mapping the Void: Two-Spirit and LGBTQ+ Experiences in Hamilton'' showed that 19% of the 906 respondents identified as non-binary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mapping the Void: Two-Spirit and LGBTQ+ Experiences in Hamilton|url=https://labourstudies.mcmaster.ca/documents/mappingthevoid.pdf|access-date=19 July 2019|date=11 Jun 2019|archive-date=3 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190703192933/https://labourstudies.mcmaster.ca/documents/mappingthevoid.pdf|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 survey of Canadian LGBT+ people called ''LGBT+ Realities Survey'' found that 4% of the 1,897 respondents identified as non-binary transgender and 1% identified as non-binary outside of the transgender umbrella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The values, needs and realities of LGBT people in Canada in 2017|url=https://fondationjasminroy.com/en/initiative/lgbt-realities-survey/|access-date=27 July 2019|date=2017|archive-date=27 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727230336/https://fondationjasminroy.com/en/initiative/lgbt-realities-survey/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
A 2011 survey conducted by the [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] in the UK found that 0.4% of the 10,039 respondents identified as non-binary. It does not allow inference about the share of non-binary people in the whole population, since the survey sample was not necessarily representative. The purpose of the survey was to test if respondents are willing to answer questions about their transsexual status.&lt;ref name="ehrc2012"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Glen |first1=Fiona |last2=Hurrell |first2=Karen |title=Technical note: Measuring Gender Identity |url=https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/sites/default/files/technical_note_final.pdf |publisher=Equality and Human Rights Commission |access-date=30 May 2019 |date=2012 |archive-date=2 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190802101054/https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/sites/default/files/technical_note_final.pdf |url-status=live |pages=4‚Äì5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
