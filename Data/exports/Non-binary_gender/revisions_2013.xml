[[File:Genderqueer pride flag.png|thumb|207px|right|The Genderqueer flag. The lavender stripe, mixing blue and pink (traditional male and female colors, also present on the trans flag) is meant to represent those under the GQ umbrella who feel they are both male and female in identity as well as “queerness.” Lavender has long been associated with homosexuality and bisexuality. Dark chartreuse green, the inverse of the lavender color, is meant to represent GQ individuals who feel they are neither male nor female in identity. The white stripe is meant to represent GQ individuals falling completely outside of the gender binary.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}]]

'''Genderqueer''' ('''GQ'''; alternatively '''non-binary''') is a catch-all category for [[Gender identity|gender identities]] other than man and woman, thus outside of the [[gender binary]] and [[Cisgender|cisnormativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=North American Lexicon of Transgender Terms |editor-last=Usher |editor-first=Raven |year=2006 |publisher= |location=[[San Francisco]] |isbn= 9781879194625 |oclc=184841392 |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genderqueer people may identify as one or more of the following:
* having an overlap of, or blurred lines between, gender identity and sexual and romantic orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genderqueercoalition.org/terms |title=GenderQueer and Queer Terms |last=Stringer |first=JAC |year=2009 |work=Educational Materials |location=[[Cincinnati]] |publisher=[http://www.genderqueercoalition.org/ Midwest Trans &amp;amp; Queer Wellness Initiative] |accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brill |first1=Stephanie A. |last2=Pepper |first2=Rachel |title=The Transgender Child: A Handbook for Families and Professionals |date=28 June 2008 |publisher=[[Cleis Press]] |location=[[San Francisco]] |isbn=9781573443180 |oclc=227570066 |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some genderqueer people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlgja.org/resources/stylebook_english.html#T |title=Transgender (adj.) |work=Stylebook Supplement on LGBT Terminology |publisher=[[National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association]] |accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glaad_transgender"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender |title=Transgender Glossary of Terms |work=GLAAD Media Reference Guide |publisher=[[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] |accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; also desire physical modification or hormones to suit their preferred expression. Many genderqueer people see gender and sex as separable aspects of a person and sometimes identify as a male woman, a female man, or a male/female/[[intersex]] genderqueer person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walsh |first1=Reuben |year=2010 |title=More T, vicar? My experiences as a genderqueer person of faith |journal=All God's Children |volume=2 |issue=3 |month=December |pages= |publisher=[[Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender identity is defined as one's internal sense of being a woman, man, both, or neither, while sexual identity refers to an individual's enduring physical, romantic, and/or emotional attraction to others.&lt;ref name="glaad_transgender" /&gt; As such, genderqueer people may have a variety of sexual orientations, as with transgender and [[cisgender]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Transgender History |last=Stryker |first=Susan |authorlink=Susan Stryker |year=2008 |publisher=[[Seal Press]] |location=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] |isbn=9781580052245 |oclc=183914566 |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being an umbrella term, ''genderqueer'' has been used as an adjective to refer to any people who transgress distinctions of gender, regardless of their self-defined gender identity, i.e. those who "[[queer]]" gender, expressing it non-normatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dahir |first=Mubarak |date=25 May 1999 |title=Whose Movement Is It? |journal=[[The Advocate]] |volume= |issue= |page=52 |publisher=[[Here Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Androgynous]] is frequently used as a descriptive term for people in this category, though genderqueer people may express a combination of masculinity and femininity, or neither, in their [[gender variance|gender expression]] and not all identify as androgynous. However, the term has been applied by those describing what they see as a gender ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Transgender Voices: Beyond Women and Men |last=Girshick |first=Lori B. |year=2008 |publisher=[[University Press of New England]] |location=[[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]] |isbn=9781584656456 |oclc=183162406 |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==&lt;span id="Gender_pronouns"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Gender terms==
Some genderqueer people prefer to use [[gender-neutral pronoun]]s such as [[one (pronoun)|one]], [[Wiktionary:ze|ze]], [[Wiktionary:sie|sie]], [[Wiktionary:hir|hir]], [[Wiktionary:co|co]], [[Spivak pronouns|ey]] or [[singular they|singular "they", "their" and "them"]], while others prefer the conventional binary pronouns [[gender-specific pronoun|"her" or "him"]]. Some genderqueer people prefer to be referred to alternately as he and she (and/or gender neutral pronouns), and some prefer to use only their name and not use pronouns at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feinberg |first=Leslie |authorlink=Leslie Feinberg |title=Transgender Warriors: Making History from Joan of Arc to Dennis Rodman |publisher=[[Beacon Press]] |location=[[Boston]] |year=1996 |isbn=9780807079409 |oclc=33014093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many genderqueer people prefer additional neutral language, such as the [[Wiktionary:MX#Abbreviation|title "Mx"]] instead of Mr or Ms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesbilicious.co.uk/non-gendered-titles-see-increased-recognition/ |title=Non-gendered titles see increased recognition |author=Ruth Pearce |date=July 21, 2011 |work=Lesbilicious |accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, Gopi Shankar, a gender activist and a student at [[The American College in Madurai]] coined the regional terms for genderqueer people in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] during Asia's first genderqueer [[Pride Parade]]. After English, Tamil is the only language that has been given names for all the genders identified so far.&lt;ref name="indiatimes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-06-04/madurai/39739581_1_genders-book-tamil-nadu |title=Madurai student pens book on gender variants |publisher=The Times of India |date=2013-06-04 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/article3702689.ece |title=Cities / Madurai : Madurai comes out of the closet |publisher=The Hindu |date=2012-07-30 |accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/no-more-under-siege/article5247859.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender neutrality==
{{Main|Gender neutrality}}
[[Gender neutrality]] is the movement to end discrimination of gender altogether in society through means of [[gender-neutral language]], the end of [[sex segregation]] and other means.

==Out genderqueer people==
* [[Chris Pureka]], an American folk music singer-songwriter, came out publicly as genderqueer in a 2005 interview with ''[[Off Our Backs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Young |first=Angie |title=An Interview with Chris Pureka |newspaper=[[Off Our Backs]] |location=[[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]] |date=1 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rae Spoon]], a Canadian singer-songwriter, identified as a [[trans man]] for many years before adopting a gender-neutral identity in 2012.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}
* [[Jiz Lee]], a [[porn star]], claimed in a personal blog post to have become more candid about being genderqueer at about age 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jizlee.com/wordpress/what-is-genderqueer/ |title=What Is Genderqueer? |last=Lee |first=Jiz |authorlink=Jiz Lee |date=15 December 2010 |work=Jiz Lee &amp;ndash; Blog |publisher=[http://www.jizlee.com/ jizlee.com] |accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Andrej Pejić]], an Australian fashion model, does not use the term genderqueer, but publicly claims to identify as neither male nor female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/topic/the_big_story/article/163861--fashion-model-straddles-gender-divide |title=Fashion model straddles gender divide |last=Criger |first=Erin |date=26 October 2011 |work=[[CityNews Toronto]] |publisher=[[Rogers Communications]] |accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title =Guy AND Doll: Man Models Women's Clothes (segment) | episodelink = | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/video/guy-doll-man-models-womens-clothes-14524558 |accessdate = 4 May 2012 |series = ABC News Nightline  |serieslink = ABC News Nightline |credits = |network =[[American Broadcasting Company]] |date = 13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kate Bornstein]], an American gender theorist, transsexual person, and author of ''Gender Outlaw: On Men, Women and the Rest of Us'' (a book about being dissatisfied with binary models of gender) identifies as neither male nor female.
* Gopi Shankar is a gender activist and a student of [[The American College in Madurai]]. He penned the first book on gender-variant people in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and he is the founder of Srishti Madurai genderqueer group.&lt;ref name="indiatimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dc-epaper.com/PUBLICATIONS/DC/DCC/2013/11/11/ArticleHtmls/TRIUMPH-OF-LABOUR-WORK-IS-WORSHIP-11112013002001.shtml?Mode=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination and legal status==
{{main|Discrimination towards non-binary gender persons}}
In an analysis of respondents to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey who chose "A gender not listed here", the majority of whom are genderqueer, it was found that Q3GNLH (Question 3 Gender Not Listed Here) respondents were 9 percentage-points (33%) more likely to forgo healthcare due to fear of discrimination than the general sample (36% compared to 27%). 76% reported being unemployed, 90% had experienced anti-trans bias at work, and 43% had attempted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/release_materials/agendernotlistedhere.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Gender Not Listed Here: Genderqueers, Gender Rebels, and OtherWise in the National Transgender Discrimination Survey |author-last=Harrison |author-first=Jack |author2-last=Grant |author2-first=Jaime |author3-last=Herman |author3-first=Jody L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, [[Australia]] became the first country in the world to recognize genderqueer identity. People who do not identify as male or female achieved formal legal recognition in Australia for the first time, after the NSW Court of Appeal overturned a ruling that everyone must be listed as a man or a woman with the Registry of Births Deaths and Marriages. It has potential implications for many others, including babies who are born with ambiguous genitalia and people who do not identify as male or female despite having physical characteristics of a man or a woman. "This is the first decision that recognizes that 'sex' is not binary - it is not only 'male' or 'female'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Bibby |url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/legal-recognition-for-those-who-dont-identify-as-either-m-or-f-20130531-2ngy4.html |title=Legal recognition for those who don't identify as either 'M' or 'F' |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=2012-08-21 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
