'''Genderqueer''', also known as '''non-binary''', is a catch-all category for [[Gender identity|gender identities]] that are not exclusively [[masculine]] or [[feminine]]{{nsmdns}}identities which are outside the [[gender binary]] and [[Cisgender|cisnormativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=North American Lexicon of Transgender Terms |editor-last=Usher |editor-first=Raven |year=2006 |publisher= |location=[[San Francisco]] |isbn= 978-1-879194-62-5|oclc=184841392 |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genderqueer people may express a combination of masculinity and femininity, or neither, in their [[gender variance|gender expression]].

== Definitions and identity ==
In addition to being an umbrella term, ''genderqueer'' has been used as an adjective to refer to any people who transgress distinctions of gender, regardless of their self-defined gender identity, or who "[[queer]]" gender. Individuals may express gender non-normatively by not conforming into the binary gender categories of "man" and "woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Dahir |first=Mubarak |date=25 May 1999 |title=Whose Movement Is It? |magazine=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |volume= |issue= |page=52 |publisher=[[Here Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Genderqueer'' is often used to self-identify by people who challenge binary social constructions of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's voices, feminist visions : classic and contemporary readings|isbn=9780078027000|edition=Sixth|location=New York, NY|oclc=862041473|last1 = Shaw|first1 = Susan|last2=Lee|first2=Janet|date=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been applied by those describing what they see as a gender ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Transgender Voices: Beyond Women and Men |last=Girshick |first=Lori B. |year=2008 |publisher=[[University Press of New England]] |location=[[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]] |isbn=978-1-58465-645-6 |oclc=183162406 |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Androgynous]]'' (also ''[[androgyne]]'') is frequently used as a descriptive term for people in this category. This is because the term androgyny is closely associated with a blend of socially defined masculine and feminine traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Voices, Feminist Visions|last=Shaw|first=Susan M.|last2=Lee|first2=Janet|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2015|isbn=|edition=6|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all genderqueer persons identify as androgynous. Some genderqueer people identify as a masculine woman or a feminine man or combine genderqueer with another gender option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Walsh|first1=Reuben|date=December 2010|title=More T, vicar?

Some references use the term ''[[transgender]]'' broadly, in such a way that it includes genderqueer/non-binary people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Johanna Schorn|title=Taking the "Sex" out of Transsexual: Representations of Trans Identities in Popular Media|url=http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/critical-issues/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/schornglpaper.pdf|website=Inter-Disciplinary.Net|publisher=Universität zu Köln|accessdate=23 October 2014|page=1|format=PDF|quote=The term transgender is an umbrella term "and generally refers to any and all kinds of variation from gender norms and expectations" (Stryker 19).

== History ==
Anthropologists such as April Scarlett Callis believe that the traditional binary system of sexual identity can be traced to the 19th century when sexuality was first medicalized.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Callis|first=April Scarlette|date=2014-02-05|title=Bisexual, pansexual, queer: Non-binary identities and the sexual borderlands|journal=Sexualities|language=en|volume=17|issue=1–2|pages=63–80|doi=10.1177/1363460713511094}}&lt;/ref&gt; People started to identify as gay when biological sciences grew in influence, churches became less powerful, and social and political structure began to change.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; George Chauncey, professor of history at Yale University, notes that during the early 20th-century gender roles rather than sexual partners were used to determine sexuality.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For instance, 'feminine" men who had sex with other men were labeled as "mollies" or "fairies", whereas masculine men who had sex with other men remained unlabeled.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The mid-20th century signaled the start of labeling individuals as either heterosexual or homosexual.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
The term genderqueer came into use during the mid-1990s. Riki Anne Wilchins is often associated with the word genderqueer, especially because of her contributions to ''Genderqueer: Voices Beyond the Sexual Binary'' which was published in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=GenderQueer : voices from beyond the sexual binary |publisher=Alyson Books |isbn=9781555837303|editor-last1=Nestle|editor-first1=Joan|editor-last2=Howell|editor-first2=Clare|editor-last3=Wilchins|editor-first3=Riki Anne |edition=1st|oclc=50389309}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 she was also published in the newsletter ''In Your Face'', where she used the term genderqueer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net/catalog?f%5Bcollection_name_ssim%5D%5B%5D=In+Your+Face&amp;f%5Bdta_other_subject_ssim%5D%5B%5D=Riki+Anne+Wilchins|title=Collection: In Your Face / Subject: Riki Anne Wilchins - Digital Transgender Archive Search Results}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the newsletter, the term appears to refer to people with complex or unnamed gender expressions. Which does not match with the general definition used today. Wilchins stated she identifies as genderqueer in her 1997 autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://genderqueerid.com/gqhistory|title=Genderqueer History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some genderqueer people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlgja.org/resources/stylebook_english.html#T|title=Transgender (adj.)|work=Stylebook Supplement on LGBT Terminology|publisher=[[National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408181824/http://www.nlgja.org/resources/stylebook_english.html|archivedate=8 April 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glaad_transgender" /&gt; are medically treated for gender dysphoria with surgery or hormones as trans men and women are.

== Gender neutrality ==
{{Main|Gender neutrality}}

Gender neutrality is the movement to end discrimination of gender altogether in society through means of [[gender-neutral language]], the end of [[sex segregation]], and other means.

== Pronouns and titles ==
[[File:Gender recognition pins cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Pronoun pin badges from a 2016 art and tech festival]]
Some genderqueer people prefer to use [[gender-neutral pronoun]]s. Usage of [[Singular they|singular 'they', 'their' and 'them']] is the most common;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NB/GQ Survey 2017 - the worldwide results |url=http://gendercensus.com/post/160656902130/nbgq-survey-2017-the-worldwide-results |website=Gender Census |accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[wikt:ze|ze]], [[wikt:sie|sie]], [[wikt:hir|hir]], [[wikt:co|co]], and [[Elverson pronoun|ey]] are used as well. Some others prefer the conventional [[gender-specific pronouns]] 'her' or 'him', prefer to be referred to alternately as 'he' and 'she', or prefer to use only their name and not use pronouns at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feinberg |first=Leslie |authorlink=Leslie Feinberg |title=Transgender Warriors: Making History from Joan of Arc to Dennis Rodman |publisher=[[Beacon Press]] |location=[[Boston]] |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-8070-7940-9 |oclc=33014093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many genderqueer people prefer additional neutral language, such as the title [[Mx (title)|'Mx.']] instead of Mr. or Ms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesbilicious.co.uk/non-gendered-titles-see-increased-recognition/ |title=Non-gendered titles see increased recognition |author=Ruth Pearce |date=21 July 2011 |work=Lesbilicious |accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal recognition ==
{{main|Legal recognition of non-binary gender}}
In today's society, many genderqueer people still use the gender they were given at birth to conduct every day business because many areas of life still conduct business with binary genders.

Genderfluid people, who also fall under the genderqueer umbrella, have their own flag as well. The pink stripe represents femininity, the white stripe represents lack of gender, the purple represents mixed gender or androgyny, the black represents all other genders, and the blue represents masculinity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2016/09/gender-fluid-added-oxford-english-dictionary/|title=Gender-fluid added to the Oxford English Dictionary|newspaper=LGBTQ Nation|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agender people, who also sometimes identify as genderqueer, have their own flag. This flag uses black and white stripes to represent an absence of gender, and a green stripe to represent non-binary genders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manzella |first=Samantha |url=http://www.newnownext.com/guide-lgbt-flags/07/2017/ |title=Beyond The Rainbow: Your Guide To LGBT Flags |publisher=NewNowNext |date=2017-10-07 |accessdate=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
