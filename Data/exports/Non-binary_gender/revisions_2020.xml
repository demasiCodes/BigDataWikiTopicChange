'''Non-binary''' (also spelled '''nonbinary''') or '''genderqueer''' is a spectrum of [[Gender identity|gender identities]] that are not exclusively [[masculine]] or [[feminine]]{{nsmdns}}identities that are outside the [[gender binary]].&lt;ref&gt;S.

Non-binary people may identify as having two or more genders (being ''bigender'' or ''trigender'');&lt;ref name="Bosson-2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Whyte/&gt; having no gender (agender, nongendered, genderless, genderfree or neutrois); moving between genders or having a fluctuating gender identity (genderfluid);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Transgender Diversity: A Sensible Explanation of Sexual and Gender Identities |last=Winter |first=Claire Ruth |year=2010 |publisher=CreateSpace |isbn=978-1-4563-1490-3 |oclc=703235508 }}&lt;/ref&gt; being [[third gender]] or other-gendered (a category that includes those who do not place a name to their gender).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/genderqueer.html |title=Genderqueer |last=Beemyn |first=Brett Genny |year=2008 |encyclopedia=glbtq: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture |location=[[Chicago]] |publisher=glbtq, Inc. |access-date=3 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425081046/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/genderqueer.html |archive-date=25 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender identity is separate from [[sexual orientation|sexual]] or [[romantic orientation]],&lt;ref name="glaad_transgender"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender|title=Transgender Glossary of Terms|work=GLAAD Media Reference Guide|publisher=[[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]]|access-date=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and non-binary people have a variety of sexual orientations, just as [[cisgender]] people do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Transgender History|last=Stryker|first=Susan|publisher=[[Seal Press]]|year=2008|isbn=978-1-58005-224-5|location=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]|oclc=183914566|author-link=Susan Stryker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-binary gender identities are not associated with a specific [[gender expression]], such as androgyny. Non-binary people as a group have a wide variety of gender expressions, and some may reject gender "identities" altogether.&lt;ref name=Schorn/&gt; Some non-binary people are medically treated for [[gender dysphoria]] with surgery or hormones, as [[Trans man|trans men]] and [[Trans woman|women]] often are.

The term ''genderqueer'' originated in [[queer]] [[zine]]s of the 1980s as a precursor to the term ''non-binary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hendrie |editor1-first=Theo |title=X Marks the Spot: An Anthology of Nonbinary Experiences |date=2019 |location=United Kingdom |isbn=978-1080968039 |page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being an umbrella term, ''genderqueer'' has been used as an adjective to refer to any people who are perceived to transcend or divert from traditional distinctions of gender, regardless of their self-defined gender identity. Individuals may express gender non-normatively by not conforming into the binary gender categories of "man" and "woman".&lt;!--Is this in terms of identity label, appearance and presentation, or both?--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Dahir |first=Mubarak |date=25 May 1999 |title=Whose Movement Is It? |magazine=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |page=52 |publisher=[[Here Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Genderqueer'' is often used to self-identify by people who challenge binary social constructions of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's voices, feminist visions : classic and contemporary readings|isbn=9780078027000|edition=Sixth|location=New York, NY|oclc=862041473|last1 = Shaw|first1 = Susan|last2=Lee|first2=Janet|date=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''genderqueer'' has also been applied by those describing what they see as a gender ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Transgender Voices: Beyond Women and Men |last=Girshick |first=Lori B. |year=2008 |publisher=[[University Press of New England]] |location=[[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]] |isbn=978-1-58465-645-6 |oclc=183162406 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Androgynous]]'' (also ''[[androgyne]]'') is frequently used as a descriptive term for people in this category. This is because the term androgyny is closely associated with a blend of socially defined masculine and feminine traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Voices, Feminist Visions|last1=Shaw|first1=Susan M.|last2=Lee|first2=Janet|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2015|edition=6|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all genderqueer people identify as androgynous. Some genderqueer people identify as a masculine woman or a feminine man or combine genderqueer with another gender option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Walsh|first1=Reuben|date=December 2010|title=More T, vicar? My experiences as a genderqueer person of faith|magazine=All God's Children|publisher=[[Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement]]|volume=2|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being non-binary is not the same as being [[intersex]], and most intersex people identify as either male or female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2016-07-09|title=Understanding Non-Binary People: How to Be Respectful and Supportive|url=https://transequality.org/issues/resources/understanding-non-binary-people-how-to-be-respectful-and-supportive|access-date=2020-06-17|website=National Center for Transgender Equality}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people use ''enby'' (from the letters 'NB') as a short form of non-binary.&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Sheridan, ''Transgender in the Workplace: The Complete Guide'' (2018), page 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sam Hope, ''Person-Centred Counselling for Trans and Gender Diverse People'' (2019), page 218&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, after the publication of ''Transgender Liberation: A Movement Whose Time Has Come'' by [[Leslie Feinberg]], the term transgender was broadened to become a term for gender variation in general.&lt;ref name="Tobia"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tobia |first1=Jacob |title=InQueery: The History of the Word 'Genderqueer' As We Know It |url=https://www.them.us/story/inqueery-genderqueer |website=them |publisher=Condé Nast |access-date=18 February 2020 |language=en |date=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is highlighted in 1994, when [[Activism|activist]] Kate Bornstein wrote "All the categories of transgender find a common ground in that they each break one or more of the rules of gender: What we have in common is that we are gender outlaws, every one of us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_VsCl7Ek4N8C&amp;q=All+the+categories+of+transgender+find+a+common+ground+in+that+they+each+break+one+or+more+of+the+rules+of+gender%3A+what+we+have+in+common+is+that+we+are+gender+outlaws%2C+every+one+of+us&amp;pg=PT79|title=Gender Outlaw: On Men, Women and the Rest of Us|last=Bornstein|first=Kate|date=2013-04-15|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-60373-0|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''genderqueer'' came into use during the mid-1990s among political activists.&lt;ref name="Tobia"/&gt; [[Riki Wilchins|Riki Anne Wilchins]] is often associated with the word and claims to have coined it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wikchins |first1=Riki |title=Get to Know the New Pronouns: They, Theirs, and Them |url=https://www.pride.com/identities/2017/3/14/get-know-new-pronouns-they-theirs-and-them |website=Pride |language=en |date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wikchins used the term in a 1995 essay published in the first issue of ''In Your Face'' to describe anyone who is [[gender nonconforming]].&lt;ref name="genderqueerid"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://genderqueerid.com/gqhistory|title=Genderqueer History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilchins |first1=Riki |title=A Note from your Editrix |journal=In Your Face |date=Spring 1995 |issue=1 |page=4 |url=http://www.gendertalk.com/pubs/InYourFace1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also one of the main contributors to the anthology ''Genderqueer: Voices Beyond the Sexual Binary'' which was published in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=GenderQueer : voices from beyond the sexual binary|publisher=[[Alyson Books]]|location=New York City|isbn=9781555837303|editor-last1=Nestle|editor-first1=Joan|editor-last2=Howell|editor-first2=Clare|editor-last3=Wilchins|editor-first3=Riki Anne|edition=1st|oclc=50389309|year=2002|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781555837303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilchins stated they identify as genderqueer in their 1997 autobiography.&lt;ref name="genderqueerid"/&gt;

The internet popularized the term ''genderqueer'', as a wide audience was able to be reached very quickly.&lt;ref name="Tobia"/&gt; In 2008, ''[[The New York Times]]'' used the word ''genderqueer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/magazine/16students-t.html|title=When Girls Will Be Boys|last=Quart|first=Alissa|date=2008-03-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tobia"/&gt; In the 2010s, this term became more popularized as many celebrities publicly identified as gender nonconforming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.them.us/story/inqueery-genderqueer|title=Do You Know What It Means to Be Genderqueer?|last=Nast|first=Condé|website=them.|language=en|access-date=2019-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Intersex &amp; Genderqueer Recognition Project was started to advocate for expanding gender options on official documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.intersexrecognition.org/about|title=About Us – Intersex &amp; Genderqueer Recognition Project (IGRP)|website=igrp|language=en|access-date=2019-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, [[Jamie Shupe]] was the first person to have a nonbinary gender on official documents in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/movement-third-gender-option-exploding-u-s-n696446|title=Movement for third gender option 'exploding' in U.S.|website=NBC News|language=en|access-date=2019-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some non-binary/genderqueer people prefer to use [[gender-neutral pronoun]]s. Usage of [[Singular they|singular 'they', 'their' and 'them']] is the most common;&lt;ref name="gendercensus2020"/&gt; non-standard pronouns such as [[wikt:xe|xe]], [[wikt:ze|ze]], [[wikt:sie|sie]], [[wikt:co|co]], and [[Elverson pronoun|ey]] are sometimes used as well.

== Legal recognition ==
{{main|Legal recognition of non-binary gender}}
In today's society, many non-binary/genderqueer people still use the gender they were given at birth to conduct everyday business, as many institutions and forms of identification – such as passports and driver's licenses – only accept, in the sense of recorded recognition, binary gender identities. However, with the increasing acceptance of non-binary gender identities and the rise in wider societal recognition, this is slowly changing, as a greater number of governments and institutions recognize and allow non-binary identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Richards|first1=Christina|last2=Bouman|first2=Walter Pierre|last3=Seal|first3=Leighton|last4=Barker|first4=Meg John|last5=Nieder|first5=Timo O.|last6=T'Sjoen|first6=Guy|date=2016|title=Non-binary or genderqueer genders|journal=International Review of Psychiatry|volume=28|issue=1|pages=95–102|pmid=26753630|doi=10.3109/09540261.2015.1106446|s2cid=29985722|url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/7279758}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Multiple countries legally recognize non-binary or [[third gender]] classifications. Some non-Western societies have long recognized transgender people as a third gender, though this may not (or may only recently)&lt;ref name=BBC-20091223&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistani eunuchs to have distinct gender |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8428819.stm|date=December 23, 2009|work=BBC News|access-date=2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; include formal legal recognition. In Western societies, Australia may have been the first country to legally recognize a classification of sex outside of 'male' and 'female' on legal documentation, following the recognition of [[Alex MacFarlane]]'s intersex status in 2003.&lt;ref name="asa"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.asanet.org/sectionsex/documents/SUMMER03sexnews.pdf | title = Newsletter of the Sociology of Sexualities Section of the American Sociological Association | journal = American Sociological Association Sexualities News | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | date = Summer 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wider legal recognition of nonbinary people – following the recognition of intersex people in 2003 – in Australian law followed between 2010 and 2014, with legal action taken against the [[New South Wales Government]] Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages by transgender activist [[Norrie May-Welby]] to recognize Norrie's legal gender identity as 'non-specific'.

While the United States does not federally recognize a non-binary gender, in 2016 [[Oregon]] became the first state to recognize a non-binary gender identity.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://harvardlawreview.org/2019/01/they-them-and-theirs/|title=They, Them, and Theirs|website=harvardlawreview.org|access-date=2019-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Oregon, in 2017 [[California]] passed an act allowing citizens to identify as "non-binary" on official documents.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; As of 2019, eight states have passed acts that allow "non-binary" or "X" designations on certain identifying documents.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; One of the main arguments against the inclusion of a third gender identifier in the U.S. is that it would make law enforcement and surveillance harder, however countries that have officially recognized a third gender marker have not reported these issues.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; In the United States there are no explicit laws to protect non-binary people from discrimination, however it is illegal for an employer to require employees to conform to sex stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989)|last1=Cecka|first1=Dale Margolin|last2=Chamallas|first2=Martha|title=Feminist Judgments|pages=341–360|date=2016|website=Feminist Judgments: Rewritten Opinions of the United States Supreme Court|language=en|doi=10.1017/cbo9781316411254.020|isbn=9781107126626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discrimination ==
{{Main|Discrimination against non-binary gender persons}}

In the United States, the majority of respondents to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey chose "A gender not listed here". The "not listed here" respondents were nine percentage-points (33 percent) more likely to report forgoing healthcare due to fear of discrimination than the general sample (36 percent compared to 27 percent). Ninety percent reported experiencing anti-trans bias at work, and 43 percent reported having attempted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/release_materials/agendernotlistedhere.pdf |title=A Gender Not Listed Here: Genderqueers, Gender Rebels, and OtherWise in the National Transgender Discrimination Survey |author-last=Harrison |author-first=Jack |author2-last=Grant |author2-first=Jaime |author3-last=Herman |author3-first=Jody L. |access-date=29 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725182217/http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/release_materials/agendernotlistedhere.pdf |archive-date=25 July 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of reported discrimination faced by non-binary individuals often includes disregard, disbelief, condescending interactions, and disrespect.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; People who are non-binary are also often viewed as partaking in part of a trend and are thus deemed insincere or attention-seeking. As an accumulation, erasure is often a large form of discrimination faced by non-binary individuals.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[Misgendering]] is also a problem that many individuals face, be it intentional or unintentional. In the case of intentional misgendering, [[transphobia]] is a driving force. Also, the use of [[they/them pronouns]] is lumped into the larger, controversial, subject of [[safe space]]s and [[political correctness]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFJDDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Cf.+S.+Bear+Bergman+&amp;pg=PR5|title=Genderqueer and Non-Binary Genders|last1=Richards|first1=Christina|last2=Bouman|first2=Walter Pierre|last3=Barker|first3=Meg-John|date=2017-12-13|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-137-51053-2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing push back, and intentional misgendering from some individuals. In the case of unintentional misgendering, it is often expected for the person who is misgendered to console and forgive the person who made the mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-08-08/so-what-are-your-pronouns|title=Introducing myself as 'they/them/their' at my workplace|website=Public Radio International|language=en|access-date=2019-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many flags have been used in non-binary and genderqueer communities to represent various identities. There are distinct non-binary and genderqueer pride flags. The genderqueer pride flag was designed in 2011 by Marilyn Roxie. Lavender represents androgyny or queerness, white represents agender identity, and green represents those whose identities which are defined outside the binary.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|first=Lynn|last=Deater|url=http://ncccommuter.org/he-she-or-they/|title=He, She or They? » The Commuter|website=ncccommuter.org|access-date=December 20, 2016|date=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/Flags%2520and%2520Symbols.pdf|title=Flags and Symbols|website=www.amherst.edu|publisher=[[Amherst University]]|location=Amherst, Massachusetts|access-date=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.davidmariner.com/flags/|title=Gender and Sexuality Awareness Flags|date=2015-10-26|newspaper=David Mariner|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-binary pride flag was created in 2014 by Kye Rowan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://letsqueerthingsup.com/2015/03/15/8-things-non-binary-people-need-to-know/|title=8 Things Non-Binary People Need to Know|date=2015-03-15|website=Let's Queer Things Up!|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yellow represents people whose gender exists outside the binary, purple represents those whose gender is a mixture of – or between – male and female, black represents people who have no gender, and white represents those who embrace many or all genders.&lt;ref name="nbflagtumblr"&gt;{{cite web |title=After counting up all the 'votes' for each variation of my nonbinary flag (to be separate from the genderqueer flag), it seems this is the most loved!

Genderfluid people, who also fall under the genderqueer umbrella, have their own flag as well. Pink represents femininity, white represents lack of gender, purple represents mixed gender or androgyny, black represents all other genders, and blue represents masculinity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2016/09/gender-fluid-added-oxford-english-dictionary/|title=Gender-fluid added to the Oxford English Dictionary|newspaper=LGBTQ Nation|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agender people, who also sometimes identify as genderqueer, have their own flag. This flag uses black and white stripes to represent an absence of gender, and a green stripe to represent non-binary genders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manzella |first=Samantha |url=http://www.newnownext.com/guide-lgbt-flags/07/2017/ |title=Beyond The Rainbow: Your Guide To LGBT Flags |publisher=NewNowNext |date=2017-10-07 |access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
