The term "genderqueer" first appeared in [[queer]] [[zine]]s of the 1980s, preceding the more widely used "non-binary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hendrie |editor1-first=Theo |title=X Marks the Spot: An Anthology of Nonbinary Experiences |date=2019 |isbn=978-1-0809-6803-9 |page=238|publisher=Independently Published }}&lt;/ref&gt; It gained prominence in the 1990s through activists,&lt;ref name="Tobia" /&gt; such as [[Riki Wilchins|Riki Anne Wilchins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wilchins |first1=Riki |title=Get to Know the New Pronouns: They, Theirs, and Them |url=https://www.pride.com/identities/2017/3/14/get-know-new-pronouns-they-theirs-and-them |website=Pride |date=March 14, 2017 |access-date=February 18, 2020 |archive-date=February 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200218052059/https://www.pride.com/identities/2017/3/14/get-know-new-pronouns-they-theirs-and-them |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; who used it in a 1995 essay and a 1997 autobiography to describe individuals deviating from traditional gender norms.&lt;ref name="genderqueerid"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://genderqueerid.com/gqhistory |title=Genderqueer History |access-date=November 2, 2018 |archive-date=November 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112060956/http://genderqueerid.com/gqhistory |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilchins |first1=Riki |title=A Note from your Editrix |journal=In Your Face |date=Spring 1995 |issue=1 |page=4 |url=http://www.gendertalk.com/pubs/InYourFace1.pdf |access-date=February 18, 2020 |archive-date=October 5, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201005123140/http://www.gendertalk.com/pubs/InYourFace1.pdf |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2002, the term had further dissemination through the anthology ''Genderqueer: Voices Beyond the Sexual Binary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=GenderQueer: voices from beyond the sexual binary |publisher=[[Alyson Books]] |location=New York City |isbn=978-1-55583-730-3 |editor1-last=Nestle |editor1-first=Joan |editor2-last=Howell |editor2-first=Clare |editor3-last=Wilchins |editor3-first=Riki Anne |edition=1st |oclc=50389309|year=2002|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781555837303}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the internet and public identification by celebrities brought the term "genderqueer" into mainstream awareness during the 2010s.&lt;ref name="Tobia" /&gt;

Genderqueer serves as both an umbrella term for non-binary identities and an adjective describing those who challenge or diverge from conventional gender distinctions, regardless of how they personally identify. It encompasses a range of expressions that transcend the binary gender categories of man and woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Shaw |first1=Susan |last2=Lee |first2=Janet |date=April 23, 2014 |title=Women's Voices Feminist Visions: Classic and Contemporary Readings |edition=Sixth |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |pages=130; 135 |isbn=978-0-07-802700-0 |oclc=862041473}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Dahir |first=Mubarak |date=May 25, 1999 |title=Whose Movement Is It? |magazine=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |page=52 |publisher=[[Here Media]] |location=San Francisco, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many non-binary/genderqueer people use the gender they were given at birth to conduct everyday business, as many institutions and forms of identification—such as passports and driver's licenses—only accept, in the sense of recorded recognition, binary gender identities. But with the increasing acceptance of non-binary gender identities and the rise in wider societal recognition, this is slowly changing, as more governments and institutions recognize and allow non-binary identities.&lt;ref name=richardsetal&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Richards |first1=Christina |last2=Bouman |first2=Walter Pierre |last3=Seal |first3=Leighton |last4=Barker |first4=Meg John |last5=Nieder |first5=Timo O. |last6=T'Sjoen |first6=Guy |date=2016 |title=Non-binary or genderqueer genders |journal=International Review of Psychiatry |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=95–102 |pmid=26753630 |doi=10.3109/09540261.2015.1106446 |s2cid=29985722 |url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/7279758 |access-date=June 9, 2019 |archive-date=June 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626224658/https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/7279758|url-status=live|hdl=1854/LU-7279758 |hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reported discrimination non-binary people face includes disregard, disbelief, condescending interactions, and disrespect.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Non-binary people are also often viewed as partaking in a trend and thus deemed insincere or attention-seeking.

[[Misgendering]], intentional or not, is also a problem that many face. In the case of intentional misgendering, [[transphobia]] is a driving force.

==Population figures==
===Argentina===
On July 20, 2021, President [[Alberto Fernández]] signed Decreto 476/2021, mandating that the National Registry of Persons (RENAPER) allow a third gender option on all [[Documento Nacional de Identidad (Argentina)|national identity cards]] and [[Argentine passport|passports]], marked as "X". The measure also applies to non-citizen permanent residents who possess Argentine identity cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boletinoficial.gob.ar/detalleAviso/primera/247092/20210721|work=[[Boletín Oficial de la República Argentina]]|title=Decreto 476/2021|date=July 20, 2021|access-date=July 21, 2021|language=es|archive-date=July 21, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210721041020/https://www.boletinoficial.gob.ar/detalleAviso/primera/247092/20210721|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2022 national census, carried out less than a year after the resolution was implemented, counted 8,293 (roughly 0.12%) of the country's population identifying with the "X / other" gender marker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.indec.gob.ar/ftp/cuadros/poblacion/cnphv2022_resultados_provisionales.pdf|title=Censo nacional de población, hogares y viviendas 2022: resultados provisionales|page=33|isbn=978-950-896-632-2|date=January 2023|publisher=[[National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina|Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos]], INDEC|access-date=July 12, 2022|language=es|archive-date=January 31, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230131220205/https://www.indec.gob.ar/ftp/cuadros/poblacion/cnphv2022_resultados_provisionales.pdf|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
A 2021 survey published in ''[[Scientific Reports]]'' concluded that 1.19% of [[Brazilians|Brazilian]] adults are non-binary, but the study did not ask whether they self-identified as non-binary. Because the authors considered most Brazilians unfamiliar with North American gender terminology, more open-ended questions about gender were asked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Spizzirri |first1=Giancarlo |last2=Eufrásio |first2=Raí |last3=Lima |first3=Maria Cristina Pereira |last4=de Carvalho Nunes |first4=Hélio Rubens |last5=Kreukels |first5=Baudewijntje P.

===Canada===
In April 2022, [[Statistics Canada]] released findings from the [[2021 Canadian census|2021 census]], making Canada the first country to ask a core question about gender identity, and found that 41,355 Canadians aged 15 and over identified as nonbinary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Easton |first=Rob |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/census-data-trans-non-binary-statscan-1.6431928 |title='Historic' census data sheds light on number of trans and non-binary people for first time |work=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=April 27, 2022 |access-date=April 28, 2022 |archive-date=April 27, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220427233104/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/census-data-trans-non-binary-statscan-1.6431928 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2019 survey of the two-spirit and LGBTQ+ population in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], called ''Mapping the Void: Two-Spirit and LGBTQ+ Experiences in Hamilton'' showed that 19% of the 906 respondents identified as non-binary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mapping the Void: Two-Spirit and LGBTQ+ Experiences in Hamilton |url=https://labourstudies.mcmaster.ca/documents/mappingthevoid.pdf |access-date=July 19, 2019 |date=June 11, 2019 |archive-date=July 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190703192933/https://labourstudies.mcmaster.ca/documents/mappingthevoid.pdf |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 survey of Canadian LGBT+ people called ''LGBT+ Realities Survey'' found that 4% of the 1,897 respondents identified as non-binary transgender and 1% identified as non-binary outside of the transgender umbrella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The values, needs and realities of LGBT people in Canada in 2017 |url=https://fondationjasminroy.com/en/initiative/lgbt-realities-survey |access-date=July 27, 2019 |date=2017 |archive-date=July 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727230336/https://fondationjasminroy.com/en/initiative/lgbt-realities-survey |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
