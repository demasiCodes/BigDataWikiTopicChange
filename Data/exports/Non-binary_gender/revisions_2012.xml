[[File:Genderqueer_pride_flag.png|thumb|207px|right|The Genderqueer flag. The lavender stripe, mixing blue and pink (traditional male and female colors, also present on the trans flag) is meant to represent those under the GQ umbrella who feel they are both male and female in identity as well as “queerness.” Lavender has long been associated with homosexuality and bisexuality. Dark chartreuse green, the inverse of the lavender color, is meant to represent GQ individuals who feel they are neither male nor female in identity. The white stripe is meant to represent GQ individuals falling completely outside of the gender binary.]]

'''Genderqueer''' ('''GQ'''; alternatively '''non-binary''') is a catch-all term for [[Gender identity|gender identities]] other than man and woman, thus outside of the [[gender binary]] and [[Cisgender|cisnormativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=North American Lexicon of Transgender Terms |editor-last=Usher |editor-first=Raven |year=2006 |publisher= |location=[[San Francisco]] |isbn= 9781879194625 |oclc=184841392 |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who identify as genderqueer may think of themselves as one or more of the following:
* both man and woman ([[bigender]], [[pangender]]);
* neither man nor woman (nongendered, genderless, agender);
* moving between genders (genderfluid);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Transgender Diversity: A Sensible Explanation of Sexual and Gender Identities |last=Winter |first=Claire Ruth |year=2010 |publisher=CreateSpace |isbn=9781456314903 |oclc=703235508 |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some genderqueer people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlgja.org/resources/stylebook_english.html#T |title=Transgender (adj.) |work=Stylebook Supplement on LGBT Terminology |publisher=[[National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association]] |accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glaad_transgender"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender |title=Transgender Glossary of Terms |work=GLAAD Media Reference Guide |publisher=[[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] |accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; also desire physical modification or hormones to suit their preferred expression. Many genderqueer people see gender and sex as separable aspects of a person and sometimes identify as a male woman, a female man, or a male/female/[[intersex]] genderqueer person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walsh |first1=Reuben |year=2010 |title=More T, vicar? My experiences as a genderqueer person of faith |journal=All God's Children |volume=2 |issue=3 |month=December |pages= |publisher=[[Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender identity is defined as one's internal sense of being a woman, man, both, or neither, while sexual identity refers to an individual's enduring physical, romantic, and/or emotional attraction to others.&lt;ref name="glaad_transgender" /&gt; As such, genderqueer people may have a variety of sexual orientations, as with transgender and [[cisgender]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Transgender History |last=Stryker |first=Susan |authorlink=Susan Stryker |year=2008 |publisher=[[Seal Press]] |location=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] |isbn=9781580052245 |oclc=183914566 |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being an umbrella term, ''genderqueer'' has been used as an adjective to refer to any people who transgress distinctions of gender, regardless of their self-defined gender identity, i.e. those who "[[queer]]" gender, expressing it non-normatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dahir |first=Mubarak |year=1999 |date=25 May 1999 |title=Whose Movement Is It? |journal=[[The Advocate]] |volume= |issue= |page=52 |publisher=[[Here Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Androgynous]] is frequently used as a descriptive term for people in this category, though genderqueer people may express a combination of masculinity and femininity, or neither, in their [[gender variance|gender expression]] and not all identify as androgynous. However, the term has been applied by those describing what they see as a gender ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Transgender Voices: Beyond Women and Men |last=Girshick |first=Lori B. |year=2008 |publisher=[[University Press of New England]] |location=[[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]] |isbn=9781584656456 |oclc=183162406 |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender pronouns==
Some genderqueer people prefer to use [[gender-neutral pronoun]]s such as [[one (pronoun)|one]], [[Wiktionary:ze|ze]], [[Wiktionary:sie|sie]], [[Wiktionary:hir|hir]], [[Wiktionary:co|co]], [[Spivak pronouns|ey]] or [[singular they|singular "they", "their" and "them"]], while others prefer the conventional binary pronouns [[gender-specific pronoun|"her" or "him"]]. Some genderqueer people prefer to be referred to alternately as he and she (and/or gender neutral pronouns), and some prefer to use only their name and not use pronouns at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feinberg |first=Leslie |authorlink=Leslie Feinberg |title=Transgender Warriors: Making History from Joan of Arc to Dennis Rodman |publisher=[[Beacon Press]] |location=[[Boston]] |year=1996 |isbn=9780807079409 |oclc=33014093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many genderqueer people prefer additional neutral language, such as the [[Wiktionary:MX#Honorific|title "Mx"]] instead of Mr or Ms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesbilicious.co.uk/non-gendered-titles-see-increased-recognition/ |title=Non-gendered titles see increased recognition |author=Ruth Pearce |date=July 21 2011 |work=Lesbilicious |accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012 Gopi Shankar,a Gender activist and a student from [[The American College in Madurai]] coined the regional terms for [[Genderqueer]] people in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] during Asia's first [[Genderqueer]] [[Pride Parade]], Gopi said apart from male and female, there are more than 20 types of genders, such as transwoman, transmen, androgynous, pangender and trigender etc and ancient [[India]] refer it as Trithiya prakirthi.&lt;ref&gt; {{http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-30/madurai/32941100_1_gender-madurai-lgbt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Out genderqueer people==
* [[Chris Pureka]], an American folk music singer-songwriter, came out publicly as genderqueer in a 2005 interview with ''[[Off Our Backs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Young |first=Angie |title=An Interview with Chris Pureka |newspaper=[[Off Our Backs]] |location=[[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]] |date=1 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rae Spoon]], a Canadian singer-songwriter, identified as a [[trans man]] for many years before adopting a gender-neutral identity in 2012.
* [[Jiz Lee]], a [[pornographic actor]], reported in a personal blog post that they became more candid about being genderqueer at about age 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jizlee.com/wordpress/what-is-genderqueer/ |title=What Is Genderqueer? |last=Lee |first=Jiz |authorlink=Jiz Lee |date=15 December 2010 |work=Jiz Lee &amp;ndash; Blog |publisher=[http://www.jizlee.com/ jizlee.com] |accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Andrej Pejic]], an Australian fashion model, does not use the term genderqueer, but has publicly stated that they identify as neither male nor female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/topic/the_big_story/article/163861--fashion-model-straddles-gender-divide |title=Fashion model straddles gender divide |last=Criger |first=Erin |date=26 October 2011 |work=[[CityNews Toronto]] |publisher=[[Rogers Communications]] |accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title =Guy AND Doll: Man Models Women's Clothes (segment) | episodelink = | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/video/guy-doll-man-models-womens-clothes-14524558 |accessdate = 4 May 2012 |series = ABC News Nightline  |serieslink = ABC News Nightline |credits = |network =[[American Broadcasting Company]] |date = 13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
