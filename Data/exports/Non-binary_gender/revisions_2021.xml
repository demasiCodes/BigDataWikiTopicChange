The term ''genderqueer'' originated in [[queer]] [[zine]]s of the 1980s as a precursor to the term ''non-binary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hendrie |editor1-first=Theo |title=X Marks the Spot: An Anthology of Nonbinary Experiences |date=2019 |isbn=978-1-0809-6803-9 |page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gained wider use in the 1990s among political activists,&lt;ref name="Tobia"/&gt; especially [[Riki Wilchins|Riki Anne Wilchins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wilchins |first1=Riki |title=Get to Know the New Pronouns: They, Theirs, and Them |url=https://www.pride.com/identities/2017/3/14/get-know-new-pronouns-they-theirs-and-them |website=Pride |language=en |date=14 March 2017 |access-date=18 February 2020 |archive-date=18 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200218052059/https://www.pride.com/identities/2017/3/14/get-know-new-pronouns-they-theirs-and-them |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilchins used the term in a 1995 essay published in the first issue of ''In Your Face'' to describe anyone who is [[gender nonconforming]], and identified as genderqueer in their 1997 autobiography.&lt;ref name="genderqueerid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genderqueerid.com/gqhistory|title=Genderqueer History|access-date=2 November 2018|archive-date=12 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112060956/http://genderqueerid.com/gqhistory|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilchins |first1=Riki |title=A Note from your Editrix |journal=In Your Face |date=Spring 1995 |issue=1 |page=4 |url=http://www.gendertalk.com/pubs/InYourFace1.pdf |access-date=18 February 2020 |archive-date=5 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201005123140/http://www.gendertalk.com/pubs/InYourFace1.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilchins was also one of the main contributors to the anthology ''Genderqueer: Voices Beyond the Sexual Binary'' published in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=GenderQueer : voices from beyond the sexual binary|publisher=[[Alyson Books]]|location=New York |isbn=978-1-55583-730-3|editor-last1=Nestle|editor-first1=Joan|editor-last2=Howell|editor-first2=Clare|editor-last3=Wilchins|editor-first3=Riki Anne|edition=1st|oclc=50389309|year=2002|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781555837303}}&lt;/ref&gt; The internet allowed the term ''genderqueer'' to spread even further than zines, and by the 2010s the term was introduced to the mainstream via celebrities who publicly identified under the ''genderqueer'' umbrella.&lt;ref name="Tobia"/&gt;

''Genderqueer'' is often used to self-identify by people who challenge binary social constructions of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's voices, feminist visions : classic and contemporary readings|isbn=978-0-07-802700-0|edition=Sixth|location=New York|oclc=862041473|last1 = Shaw|first1 = Susan|last2=Lee|first2=Janet|date=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2021}} In addition to being an umbrella term for non-binary gender identities, ''genderqueer'' has been used as an adjective to refer to any people who are perceived to transcend or divert from traditional distinctions of gender, regardless of their gender identity.

The term ''genderqueer'' has also been applied by those describing what they see as gender ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Transgender Voices: Beyond Women and Men |last=Girshick |first=Lori B. |year=2008 |publisher=[[University Press of New England]] |location=[[Hanover, New Hampshire]] |isbn=978-1-58465-645-6 |oclc=183162406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2021}} [[Androgyny|Androgynous]] (also ''[[androgyne]]'') is frequently used as a descriptive term for people in this category. This is because the term ''androgyny'' is closely associated with a blend of socially defined masculine and feminine traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Voices, Feminist Visions|last1=Shaw|first1=Susan M.|last2=Lee|first2=Janet|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Education]]|year=2015|edition=6|location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2021}} However, not all genderqueer people identify as androgynous.

However, with the increasing acceptance of non-binary gender identities and the rise in wider societal recognition, this is slowly changing, as a greater number of governments and institutions recognize and allow non-binary identities.&lt;ref name=richardsetal&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Richards|first1=Christina|last2=Bouman|first2=Walter Pierre|last3=Seal|first3=Leighton|last4=Barker|first4=Meg John|last5=Nieder|first5=Timo O.|last6=T'Sjoen|first6=Guy|date=2016|title=Non-binary or genderqueer genders|journal=International Review of Psychiatry|volume=28|issue=1|pages=95‚Äì102|pmid=26753630|doi=10.3109/09540261.2015.1106446|s2cid=29985722|url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/7279758|access-date=9 June 2019|archive-date=26 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626224658/https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/7279758|url-status=live|hdl=1854/LU-7279758|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple countries legally recognize non-binary or [[third gender]] classifications. Some non-Western societies have long recognized transgender people as a third gender, though this may not (or may only recently)&lt;ref name=BBC-20091223&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistani eunuchs to have distinct gender|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8428819.stm|date=December 23, 2009|work=BBC News|access-date=2009-12-23|archive-date=18 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200518094705/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8428819.stm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; include formal legal recognition.

== Discrimination ==
{{Main|Discrimination against non-binary people}}

Various countries throughout history have criminalized transgender and non-binary gender identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Wareham|first=Jamie|title=New Report Shows Where It's Illegal To Be Transgender In 2020|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiewareham/2020/09/30/this-is-where-its-illegal-to-be-transgender-in-2020/|access-date=2021-04-30|website=Forbes|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{bsn|date=April 2021}} 

In the United States, the majority of respondents to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey chose "A gender not listed here". The "not listed here" respondents were nine percentage-points (33 percent) more likely to report forgoing healthcare due to fear of discrimination than the general sample (36 percent compared to 27 percent). Ninety percent reported experiencing anti-trans bias at work, and 43 percent reported having attempted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/release_materials/agendernotlistedhere.pdf |title=A Gender Not Listed Here: Genderqueers, Gender Rebels, and OtherWise in the National Transgender Discrimination Survey |author-last=Harrison |author-first=Jack |author2-last=Grant |author2-first=Jaime |author3-last=Herman |author3-first=Jody L. |access-date=29 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725182217/http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/release_materials/agendernotlistedhere.pdf |archive-date=25 July 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of reported discrimination faced by non-binary individuals often includes disregard, disbelief, condescending interactions, and disrespect.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; People who are non-binary are also often viewed as partaking in part of a trend and are thus deemed insincere or attention-seeking. As an accumulation, erasure is often a large form of discrimination faced by non-binary individuals.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[Misgendering]] is also a problem that many individuals face, be it intentional or unintentional. In the case of intentional misgendering, [[transphobia]] is a driving force. Also, the use of [[they/them pronouns]] is lumped into the larger, controversial, subject of [[safe space]]s and [[political correctness]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFJDDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Cf.+S.+Bear+Bergman+&amp;pg=PR5|title=Genderqueer and Non-Binary Genders|last1=Richards|first1=Christina|last2=Bouman|first2=Walter Pierre|last3=Barker|first3=Meg-John|year=2017|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-137-51053-2|language=en|access-date=19 October 2020|archive-date=2 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210302223320/https://books.google.com/books?id=qFJDDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Cf.+S.+Bear+Bergman+&amp;pg=PR5|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing push back, and intentional misgendering from some individuals.

Many flags have been used in non-binary and genderqueer communities to represent various identities. There are distinct non-binary and genderqueer pride flags. The genderqueer pride flag was designed in 2011 by Marilyn Roxie. Lavender represents androgyny or queerness, white represents agender identity, and green represents those whose identities which are defined outside the binary.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|first=Lynn|last=Deater|url=http://ncccommuter.org/he-she-or-they/|title=He, She or They? ¬ª The Commuter|website=ncccommuter.org|access-date=December 20, 2016|date=April 29, 2015|archive-date=21 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221090439/http://ncccommuter.org/he-she-or-they/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/Flags%2520and%2520Symbols.pdf|title=Flags and Symbols|website=www.amherst.edu|publisher=[[Amherst University]]|location=Amherst, Massachusetts|access-date=December 20, 2016|archive-date=10 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510154054/https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/Flags%2520and%2520Symbols.pdf|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.davidmariner.com/flags/|title=Gender and Sexuality Awareness Flags|date=2015-10-26|newspaper=David Mariner|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-20|archive-date=3 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203153557/http://www.davidmariner.com/flags/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-binary pride flag was created in 2014 by Kye Rowan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://letsqueerthingsup.com/2015/03/15/8-things-non-binary-people-need-to-know/|title=8 Things Non-Binary People Need to Know|date=2015-03-15|website=Let's Queer Things Up!|access-date=2016-12-20|archive-date=22 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222123705/https://letsqueerthingsup.com/2015/03/15/8-things-non-binary-people-need-to-know/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yellow represents people whose gender exists outside the binary, purple represents those whose gender is a mixture of ‚Äì or between ‚Äì male and female, black represents people who have no gender, and white represents those who embrace many or all genders.&lt;ref name="nbflagtumblr"&gt;{{cite web |title=After counting up all the 'votes' for each variation of my nonbinary flag (to be separate from the genderqueer flag), it seems this is the most loved!

A 2011 survey conducted by the [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] in the UK found that 0.4% of the 10,039 respondents identified as non-binary. It does not allow inference about the share of non-binary people in the whole population, since the survey sample was not necessarily representative.
