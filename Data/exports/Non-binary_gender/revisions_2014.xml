'''Genderqueer''' ('''GQ'''; alternatively '''non-binary''') is a catch-all category for [[Gender identity|gender identities]] other than man and woman, thus outside of the [[gender binary]] and [[Cisgender|cisnormativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=North American Lexicon of Transgender Terms |editor-last=Usher |editor-first=Raven |year=2006 |publisher= |location=[[San Francisco]] |isbn= 9781879194625 |oclc=184841392 |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genderqueer people may identify as one or more of the following:

Some genderqueer people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlgja.org/resources/stylebook_english.html#T |title=Transgender (adj.) |work=Stylebook Supplement on LGBT Terminology |publisher=[[National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association]] |accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glaad_transgender"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender |title=Transgender Glossary of Terms |work=GLAAD Media Reference Guide |publisher=[[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] |accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; also desire physical modification or hormones to suit their preferred expression. Many genderqueer people see gender and sex as separable aspects of a person and sometimes identify as a male woman, a female man, or a male/female/[[intersex]] genderqueer person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walsh |first1=Reuben |date=December 2010 |title=More T, vicar? My experiences as a genderqueer person of faith |journal=All God's Children |volume=2 |issue=3  |pages= |publisher=[[Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender identity is defined as one's internal sense of being a woman, man, both, or neither, while sexual orientation refers to an individual's enduring physical, romantic, and/or emotional attraction to others.&lt;ref name="glaad_transgender" /&gt; As such, genderqueer people may have a variety of sexual orientations, as with transgender and [[cisgender]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Transgender History |last=Stryker |first=Susan |authorlink=Susan Stryker |year=2008 |publisher=[[Seal Press]] |location=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] |isbn=9781580052245 |oclc=183914566 |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being an umbrella term, ''genderqueer'' has been used as an adjective to refer to any people who transgress distinctions of gender, regardless of their self-defined gender identity, i.e. those who "[[queer]]" gender, expressing it non-normatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dahir |first=Mubarak |date=25 May 1999 |title=Whose Movement Is It? |journal=[[The Advocate]] |volume= |issue= |page=52 |publisher=[[Here Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Androgynous]] is frequently used as a descriptive term for people in this category, though genderqueer people may express a combination of masculinity and femininity, or neither, in their [[gender variance|gender expression]] and not all identify as androgynous. However, the term has been applied by those describing what they see as a gender ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Transgender Voices: Beyond Women and Men |last=Girshick |first=Lori B. |year=2008 |publisher=[[University Press of New England]] |location=[[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]] |isbn=9781584656456 |oclc=183162406 |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genderqueer was one of 56 gender identity options added to [[Facebook]] in February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2014/02/21/gender_facebook_now_has_56_categories_to_choose_from_including_cisgender.html|title=Confused by All the New Facebook Genders?

==&lt;span id="Gender_pronouns"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Gender terms==
Some genderqueer people prefer to use [[gender-neutral pronoun]]s such as [[one (pronoun)|one]], [[Wiktionary:ze|ze]], [[Wiktionary:sie|sie]], [[Wiktionary:hir|hir]], [[Wiktionary:co|co]], [[Elverson pronoun|ey]] or [[singular they|singular "they", "their" and "them"]], while others prefer the conventional [[gender-specific pronoun|binary pronouns]] "her" or "him". Some genderqueer people prefer to be referred to alternately as he and she, and some prefer to use only their name and not use pronouns at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feinberg |first=Leslie |authorlink=Leslie Feinberg |title=Transgender Warriors: Making History from Joan of Arc to Dennis Rodman |publisher=[[Beacon Press]] |location=[[Boston]] |year=1996 |isbn=9780807079409 |oclc=33014093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many genderqueer people prefer additional neutral language, such as the [[Wiktionary:MX#Abbreviation|title "Mx"]] instead of Mr. or Ms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesbilicious.co.uk/non-gendered-titles-see-increased-recognition/ |title=Non-gendered titles see increased recognition |author=Ruth Pearce |date=July 21, 2011 |work=Lesbilicious |accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, Gopi Shankar, a gender activist and a student at [[The American College in Madurai]] coined the regional terms for genderqueer ({{lang-ta|பால்புதுமையினர்}})  people in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] during Asia's first genderqueer [[Pride Parade]].

==Gender neutrality==
{{Main|Gender neutrality}}
[[Gender neutrality]] is the movement to end discrimination of gender altogether in society through means of [[gender-neutral language]], the end of [[sex segregation]] and other means.

== Pride flag ==
[[File:Genderqueer pride flag.png|thumb|Genderqueer and non-binary pride flag]]
Designed by Marilyn Roxie and completed in 2011, the genderqueer and non-binary pride flag composes of three horizontal stripes and is designed to complement existing gender and sexuality flags.

Lavender stands as a mixture of blue and pink, traditionally associated with men and women, and so represents androgyny as well as 'queerness', as it has long-standing connections to non-heterosexual communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://case.edu/lgbt/resources/questions.html|title = Why is lavender often associated with the gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender rights movements?|date = |accessdate = 26 July 2014|website = Case Western Reserve University|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; White stands for agender, reflecting the use of white on the [[Transgender flags#Transgender Pride flag|transgender flag]] for 'gender neutral', and dark chartreuse green stands as the inverse of lavender, representing all whose identity is outside or without connection to the gender binary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://genderqueerid.com/about-flag|title = About the Flag|date = April 2013|accessdate = 26 July 2014|website = Genderqueer Identities|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Roxie clarified that the similarity shared between the colours of the pride flag and those of the [[Women's Social and Political Union]], a United Kingdom suffrage organisation, was unintentional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://genderqueerid.com/post/48778828472/on-the-genderqueer-and-non-binary-flag-and-suffragette|title = On the Genderqueer and Non-Binary Flag and Suffragette Colours in the UK|date = 24 April 2013|accessdate = 26 July 2014|website = Genderqueer Identities|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination and legal status==
{{main|Discrimination towards non-binary gender persons}}
The majority of respondents to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey chose "A gender not listed here."  The Q3GNLH (Question 3 Gender Not Listed Here) respondents reported being 9 percentage-points (33%) more likely to forgo healthcare due to fear of discrimination than the general sample (36% compared to 27%). 76% reported being unemployed, 90% reported experiencing anti-trans bias at work, and 43% reported having attempted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/release_materials/agendernotlistedhere.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Gender Not Listed Here: Genderqueers, Gender Rebels, and OtherWise in the National Transgender Discrimination Survey |author-last=Harrison |author-first=Jack |author2-last=Grant |author2-first=Jaime |author3-last=Herman |author3-first=Jody L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===

First reported in January 2003, Australians can use "X" as their gender. [[Alex MacFarlane]] is believed to be the first person in Australia to obtain a birth certificate recording sex as indeterminate, and the first Australian passport with an 'X' sex marker in 2003.&lt;ref name="West Australian"&gt;[http://www.bodieslikeours.org/pdf/xmarks.pdf "X marks the spot for intersex Alex"], West Australian, via bodieslikeours.org. 11 January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Science as Culture"&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09505430802280784?journalCode=csac20#.Un8OUZFw1cc "Ingrid Holme, "Hearing People's Own Stories", in Science as Culture, Volume 17, Issue 3, 2008"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sydney Morning Herald"&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/neither-man-nor-woman-20100626-zaye.html "Neither man nor woman"], Sydney Morning Herald. 27 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sydney Morning Herald" /&gt;&lt;ref name="asa"&gt;[http://www.asanet.org/sectionsex/documents/SUMMER03sexnews.pdf Newsletter of the Sociology of Sexualities Section of the American Sociological Association], American Sociological Association Sexualities News, Volume 6, Issue 1, Summer 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oii10"&gt;[http://oii.org.au/21597/ Ten years of ‘X’ passports, and no protection from discrimination], Organisation Intersex International (OII) Australia, 19 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This is stated by the West Australian to be on the basis of a challenge by MacFarlane, using an indeterminate birth certificate issued by the State of Victoria. The West Australian newspaper reported in January 2003 that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade "had decided to accommodate people whose birth certificates recorded their sex as indeterminate ... Alex is also believed to be the first Australian issued with a birth certificate acknowledging a gender other than male or female. Alex's says “indeterminate - also known as intersex”. It was issued in Alex's birth State of Victoria, which unlike WA, changed its policy to allow the category".&lt;ref name="West Australian" /&gt;

Government policy between 2003 and 2011 was to issue passports with an 'X' marker only to people who could "present a birth certificate that notes their sex as indeterminate".&lt;ref name="oii10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.humanrights.gov.au/sex-files-legal-recognition-concluding-paper-sex-and-gender-2009#Heading495, Sex Files: the legal recognition of sex in documents and government records. Concluding paper of the sex and gender diversity project (2009)], Australian Human Rights Commission, March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Australian [[Passport]] Office introduced new guidelines for issuing of passports with a new gender, and broadened availability of an X descriptor to all individuals with documented "indeterminate" sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Getting a passport made easier for sex and gender diverse people|url=http://foreignminister.gov.au/releases/2011/kr_mr_110914b.html|accessdate=23 December 2011|newspaper=The Hon Kevin Rudd MP|date=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oii.org.au/14763/on-x-passports/ On Australian passports and “X” for sex], Organisation Intersex International (OII) Australia, 9 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The revised policy stated that "sex reassignment surgery is not a prerequisite to issue a passport in a new gender.

Australian Commonwealth guidelines on the recognition of sex and gender, published in June 2013, now extend the use of an 'X' gender marker to any adult who chooses that option, in all dealings with the Commonwealth government and its agencies. The option is being introduced over a three year period. The guidelines also clarify that the federal government collects data on [[gender]], rather than [[sex]].&lt;ref name="agrecog"&gt;[http://www.ag.gov.au/Publications/Pages/AustralianGovernmentGuidelinesontheRecognitionofSexandGender.aspx Australian Government Attorney General's Department, June 2013, "Australian Government Guidelines on the Recognition of Sex and Gender"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2013, people with non-binary gender identities received formal protection from discrimination, with the addition of a new attribute "gender identity" to anti-discrimination law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oii.org.au/22713/sex-discrimination-amendment-intersex-status-act/ On the historic passing of the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) Act 2013], OII Australia, 25 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oii.org.au/22728/joint-press-release-sex-discrimination-amendment/ LGBTI groups welcome the passage of “historic” national discrimination laws], OII Australia, NSW Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby, Transgender Victoria, A Gender Agenda, Victorian Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby, 26 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
