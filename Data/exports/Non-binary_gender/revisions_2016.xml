'''Genderqueer''' ('''GQ'''), also termed '''non-binary''', is a [[catch-all]] category for [[Gender identity|gender identities]] that are not exclusively [[masculine]] or [[feminine]]{{nsmdns}}identities which are thus outside of the [[gender binary]] and [[Cisgender|cisnormativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=North American Lexicon of Transgender Terms |editor-last=Usher |editor-first=Raven |year=2006 |publisher= |location=[[San Francisco]] |isbn= 978-1-879194-62-5|oclc=184841392 |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genderqueer people may identify as one or more of the following:

== Definitions and identity ==
In addition to being an umbrella term, ''genderqueer'' has been used as an adjective to refer to any people who transgress distinctions of gender, regardless of their self-defined gender identity, i.e., those who "[[queer]]" gender, expressing it non-normatively, or overall not conforming into the binary genders, man and woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dahir |first=Mubarak |date=25 May 1999 |title=Whose Movement Is It? |journal=[[The Advocate]] |volume= |issue= |page=52 |publisher=[[Here Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Androgynous]]'' (also ''[[androgyne]]'') is frequently used as a descriptive term for people in this category, though genderqueer people may express a combination of masculinity and femininity, or neither, in their [[gender variance|gender expression]], and not all identify as androgynous. However, the term has been applied by those describing what they see as a gender ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Transgender Voices: Beyond Women and Men |last=Girshick |first=Lori B. |year=2008 |publisher=[[University Press of New England]] |location=[[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]] |isbn=978-1-58465-645-6 |oclc=183162406 |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some references use the term ''[[transgender]]'' broadly, in such a way that it includes genderqueer/non-binary people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Johanna Schorn|title=Taking the "Sex" out of Transsexual: Representations of Trans Identities in Popular Media|url=http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/critical-issues/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/schornglpaper.pdf|website=Inter-Disciplinary.Net|publisher=Universität zu Köln|accessdate=23 October 2014|page=1|format=PDF|quote=The term transgender is an umbrella term "and generally refers to any and all kinds of variation from gender norms and expectations" (Stryker 19).

== Gender neutrality ==
{{Main|Gender neutrality}}

Gender neutrality is the movement to end discrimination of gender altogether in society through means of [[gender-neutral language]], the end of [[sex segregation]], and other means.

== Pronouns and titles ==

Some genderqueer people prefer to use [[gender-neutral pronoun]]s such as [[one (pronoun)|one]], [[wikt:ze|ze]], [[wikt:sie|sie]], [[wikt:hir|hir]], [[wikt:co|co]], [[Elverson pronoun|ey]] or [[singular they|singular "they", "their" and "them"]], while others prefer the conventional [[gender-specific pronouns]] "her" or "him".

In June 2016, the government of the province of [[Ontario]] announced changes to the way gender will be displayed on health cards and driver's licenses. Starting June 13, the Ontario health card no longer displays a sex designation. In early 2017, Ontario drivers will have the option to display "X" as a gender identifier on their driver's licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender on Health Cards and Driver's Licences|url=https://news.ontario.ca/mgs/en/2016/06/gender-on-health-cards-and-drivers-licences.html|website=Government of Ontario|accessdate=November 7, 2016|date=June 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 26, 2016, [[intersex]] [[California]] resident Sara Kelly Keenan became the second person in the United States to legally change her gender to non-binary. Keenan, who uses she/her pronouns and identifies as intersex "both as my medical reality and as my gender identification", cited Shupe's case as inspiration for her petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Hara|first1=Mary Emily|title=Californian Becomes Second US Citizen Granted 'Non-Binary' Gender Status|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/californian-becomes-second-us-citizen-granted-non-binary-gender-status-n654611|website=[[NBC News]]|accessdate=September 26, 2016|date=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
