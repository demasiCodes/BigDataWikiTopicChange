'''Genderqueer''' ('''GQ'''), also termed '''non-binary''', is a [[catch-all]] category for [[Gender identity|gender identities]] that are not exclusively [[masculine]] or [[feminine]]—identities which are thus outside of the [[gender binary]] and [[Cisgender|cisnormativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=North American Lexicon of Transgender Terms |editor-last=Usher |editor-first=Raven |year=2006 |publisher= |location=[[San Francisco]] |isbn= 978-1-879194-62-5|oclc=184841392 |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genderqueer people may identify as one or more of the following:
* having an overlap of, or indefinite lines between, gender identity;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brill |first1=Stephanie A. |last2=Pepper |first2=Rachel |title=The Transgender Child: A Handbook for Families and Professionals |date=28 June 2008 |publisher=[[Cleis Press]] |location=[[San Francisco]] |isbn=978-1-57344-318-0 |oclc=227570066 |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* having two or more genders (being [[bigender]], [[trigender]], or [[pangender]]);
* having no gender (being [[:wikt:agender|agender]], [[:wikt:nongendered|nongendered]], [[:wikt:genderless|genderless]], [[:wikt:gender-free|genderfree]] or [[:wikt:neutrois|neutrois]]);

[[Gender and sex]] are distinct concepts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gender/whatisgender/en/|title=WHO – World Health Organization|work=who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some genderqueer people identify as a male woman or a female man, or combine genderqueer with another gender option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walsh |first1=Reuben |date=December 2010 |title=More T, vicar?

In addition to being an umbrella term, ''genderqueer'' has been used as an adjective to refer to any people who transgress distinctions of gender, regardless of their self-defined gender identity, i.e. those who "[[queer]]" gender, expressing it non-normatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dahir |first=Mubarak |date=25 May 1999 |title=Whose Movement Is It? |journal=[[The Advocate]] |volume= |issue= |page=52 |publisher=[[Here Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Androgynous]]'' is frequently used as a descriptive term for people in this category, though genderqueer people may express a combination of masculinity and femininity, or neither, in their [[gender variance|gender expression]], and not all identify as androgynous. However, the term has been applied by those describing what they see as a gender ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Transgender Voices: Beyond Women and Men |last=Girshick |first=Lori B. |year=2008 |publisher=[[University Press of New England]] |location=[[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]] |isbn=978-1-58465-645-6 |oclc=183162406 |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some references use the term ''[[transgender]]'' broadly, in such a way that it includes genderqueer/non-binary people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Johanna Schorn|title=Taking the "Sex" out of Transsexual: Representations of Trans Identities in Popular Media|url=http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/critical-issues/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/schornglpaper.pdf|website=Inter-Disciplinary.Net|publisher=Universität zu Köln|accessdate=23 October 2014|page=1|format=PDF|quote=The term transgender is an umbrella term "and generally refers to any and all kinds of variation from gender norms and expectations" (Stryker 19).

== Gender terms ==

=== General ===
Some genderqueer people prefer to use [[gender-neutral pronoun]]s such as [[one (pronoun)|one]], [[Wiktionary:ze|ze]], [[Wiktionary:sie|sie]], [[Wiktionary:hir|hir]], [[Wiktionary:co|co]], [[Elverson pronoun|ey]] or [[singular they|singular "they", "their" and "them"]], while others prefer the conventional [[gender-specific pronoun|binary pronouns]] "her" or "him". Some genderqueer people prefer to be referred to alternately as he and she, and some prefer to use only their name and not use pronouns at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feinberg |first=Leslie |authorlink=Leslie Feinberg |title=Transgender Warriors: Making History from Joan of Arc to Dennis Rodman |publisher=[[Beacon Press]] |location=[[Boston]] |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-8070-7940-9 |oclc=33014093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many genderqueer people prefer additional neutral language, such as the [[wikt:Mx|title "Mx"]] instead of Mr. or Ms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesbilicious.co.uk/non-gendered-titles-see-increased-recognition/ |title=Non-gendered titles see increased recognition |author=Ruth Pearce |date=July 21, 2011 |work=Lesbilicious |accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genderqueer was one of 56 gender identity options added to [[Facebook]] in February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2014/02/21/gender_facebook_now_has_56_categories_to_choose_from_including_cisgender.html|title=Confused by All the New Facebook Genders? Here's What They Mean.|publisher=Slate|last=Weber|first=Peter|date=February 21, 2014|accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agender ===
'''Agender''' (from '[[Wiktionary:a-#Etymology|a]]-', meaning "without", and '[[gender]]') people, also called genderless, genderfree, non-gendered, or ungendered people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LGBTQ Needs Assessment|url= http://encompassnetwork.org.uk/uploads/LGBTQ-Needs-Assesmentabsolutelyfinal.pdf|website=Encompass Network|accessdate=18 October 2014|pages=52–53|format=PDF|date= April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender alphabet|url= http://www.safehomesma.org/gender_alphabet.pdf|website=Safe Homes|accessdate=18 October 2014|page=1|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; are those who identify as having no gender or being without any gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Autostaddle.com|author=A. Stiffler|title=Five Things You Should Know About Your Agender Acquaintance|date=23 April 2014|url=http://www.autostraddle.com/five-things-you-should-know-about-your-agender-acquaintance-230899/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This category includes a very broad range of identities which do not conform to traditional [[gender norms]]. However, Enke notes that people who identify with any of these positions may not necessarily self-identify as transgender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Note on terms and concepts|author=Enke, Anne|title= Transfeminist Perspectives In and Beyond Transgender and Gender Studies |editor= Enke, Anne|publisher=[[Temple University Press]]|pages=16-20, see pp. 18-9|isbn= 978-1-4399-0748-1|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neutrois and agender were two of 50 available "custom" genders on [[Facebook]], which were added on February 13, 2014.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/10637968/Facebook-sex-changes-which-one-of-50-genders-are-you.html Facebook sex changes: which one of 50 genders are you?]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. February 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Agender is also available as a gender option on [[OkCupid]] since 17 November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/okcupid-expands-gender-sexuality-options/|title=OkCupid expands gender and sexuality options|publisher=PBS NewsHour|date=17 November 2014|accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender neutrality ==
{{Main|Gender neutrality}}
Gender neutrality is the movement to end discrimination of gender altogether in society through means of [[gender-neutral language]], the end of [[sex segregation]], and other means.

== Legal recognition of non-binary gender ==

In Australia, sex/gender can be listed on passports as "male", "female", or "X" (for "indeterminate/intersex/unspecified").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/15/australian-passports-third-gender-option]&lt;/ref&gt; An alliance of organizations including the [[National LGBTI Health Alliance]], [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] and [[Transgender Victoria]] has called for "X" to be redefined as "non-binary".&lt;ref&gt;[http://lgbtihealth.org.au/resources/submission-review-agd-guidelines/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of respondents to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey chose "A gender not listed here." The Q3GNLH (Question 3 Gender Not Listed Here) respondents reported being 9 percentage-points (33%) more likely to forgo healthcare due to fear of discrimination than the general sample (36% compared to 27%). 90% reported experiencing anti-trans bias at work and 43% reported having attempted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/release_materials/agendernotlistedhere.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Gender Not Listed Here: Genderqueers, Gender Rebels, and OtherWise in the National Transgender Discrimination Survey |author-last=Harrison |author-first=Jack |author2-last=Grant |author2-first=Jaime |author3-last=Herman |author3-first=Jody L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
