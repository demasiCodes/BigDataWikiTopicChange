There are different modes of being genderqueer, and it is an evolving concept. Some believe they are a little of both or feel they have no gender at all. Others believe that gender is a social construct, and choose not to adhere to that construct. Some genderqueers do fit into the stereotypical [[gender role]]s expected of their [[sex]], but still reject gender as a social construct. Still other people identify as genderqueer since, though they are [[cisgender]]ed, they do not fit many of society's expectations for the gender in which they identify. 

This term can (but does not necessarily) include any ''[[transgender]]'' person.  These individuals challenge the social norms of gender definition, in much the same way as [[homosexual]] and [[bisexual]] individuals challenge the social norms of [[sexuality]].

Some genderqueers prefer that one use [[gender-neutral pronoun]]s to refer to them, such as [[sie and hir|"sie" and "hir"]] or [[singular they|singular "they"]] instead of [[gender-specific pronoun|her/his]], and some prefer the use only of their name and no pronouns at all.
