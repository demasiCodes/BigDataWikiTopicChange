'''Non-binary''' is a spectrum of [[Gender identity|gender identities]] that are not exclusively [[masculine]] or [[feminine]]{{nsmdns}}identities that are outside the [[gender binary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=North American Lexicon of Transgender Terms |editor-last=Usher |editor-first=Raven |year=2006 |location=[[San Francisco]] |isbn= 978-1-879194-62-5|oclc=184841392 |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Genderqueer''' is an earlier term with the same meaning, originating from [[queer]] [[zine]]s of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hendrie |editor1-first=Theo |title=X Marks the Spot: An Anthology of Nonbinary Experiences |date=2019 |location=United Kingdom |isbn=978-1080968039 |page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-binary identities can fall under the [[transgender]] umbrella, since many non-binary people identify with a gender that is different from their assigned sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetrevorproject.org/trvr_support_center/trans-gender-identity/|title=Trans + Gender Identity|website=The Trevor Project|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender identity is separate from [[sexual orientation|sexual]] or [[romantic orientation]],&lt;ref name="glaad_transgender"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender|title=Transgender Glossary of Terms|work=GLAAD Media Reference Guide|publisher=[[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]]|accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and non-binary people have a variety of sexual orientations, just as [[cisgender]] people do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Transgender History|last=Stryker|first=Susan|publisher=[[Seal Press]]|year=2008|isbn=978-1-58005-224-5|location=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]|page=|pages=|oclc=183914566|authorlink=Susan Stryker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A non-binary gender is not associated with a specific [[gender expression]], such as androgyny. Non-binary people as a group have a wide variety of gender expressions, and some may reject gender "identities" altogether.&lt;ref name=Schorn/&gt;

In addition to being an umbrella term, ''genderqueer'' has been used as an adjective to refer to any people who transgress distinctions of gender, regardless of their self-defined gender identity, or who "[[Queering|queer]]" gender. Individuals may express gender non-normatively by not conforming into the binary gender categories of "man" and "woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Dahir |first=Mubarak |date=25 May 1999 |title=Whose Movement Is It? |magazine=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |volume= |issue= |page=52 |publisher=[[Here Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Genderqueer'' is often used to self-identify by people who challenge binary social constructions of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's voices, feminist visions : classic and contemporary readings|isbn=9780078027000|edition=Sixth|location=New York, NY|oclc=862041473|last1 = Shaw|first1 = Susan|last2=Lee|first2=Janet|date=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Legal recognition of non-binary gender}}
In today's society, many non-binary/genderqueer people still use the gender they were given at birth to conduct everyday business because many areas of life still conduct business with binary genders. Things are changing though as more businesses are becoming more accepting of non-binary genders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richards|first=Christina|last2=Bouman|first2=Walter Pierre|last3=Seal|first3=Leighton|last4=Barker|first4=Meg John|last5=Nieder|first5=Timo O.|last6=T'Sjoen|first6=Guy|date=2016|title=Non-binary or genderqueer genders|journal=International Review of Psychiatry|volume=28|issue=1|pages=95–102|pmid=26753630|doi=10.3109/09540261.2015.1106446|url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/7279758}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple countries legally recognize non-binary or [[third gender]] classifications.

{{Main|Discrimination against non-binary gender persons}}

In the United States, the majority of respondents to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey chose "A gender not listed here." The "not listed here" respondents were nine percentage-points (33 percent) more likely to report forgoing healthcare due to fear of discrimination than the general sample (36 percent compared to 27 percent). Ninety percent reported experiencing anti-trans bias at work, and 43 percent reported having attempted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/release_materials/agendernotlistedhere.pdf |title=A Gender Not Listed Here: Genderqueers, Gender Rebels, and OtherWise in the National Transgender Discrimination Survey |author-last=Harrison |author-first=Jack |author2-last=Grant |author2-first=Jaime |author3-last=Herman |author3-first=Jody L. |access-date=29 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725182217/http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/release_materials/agendernotlistedhere.pdf |archive-date=25 July 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many flags have been used in non-binary and genderqueer communities to represent various identities. There are distinct non-binary and genderqueer pride flags. The genderqueer pride flag was designed in 2011 by Marilyn Roxie. Lavender represents androgyny or queerness, white represents agender identity, and green represents those whose identities which are defined outside the binary.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|first=Lynn|last=Deater|url=http://ncccommuter.org/he-she-or-they/|title=He, She or They? » The Commuter|website=ncccommuter.org|access-date=December 20, 2016|date=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/Flags%2520and%2520Symbols.pdf|title=Flags and Symbols|last=|first=|date=|website=www.amherst.edu|publisher=[[Amherst University]]|location=Amherst, Massachusetts|access-date=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.davidmariner.com/flags/|title=Gender and Sexuality Awareness Flags|date=2015-10-26|newspaper=David Mariner|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-binary pride flag was created in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://letsqueerthingsup.com/2015/03/15/8-things-non-binary-people-need-to-know/|title=8 Things Non-Binary People Need to Know|date=2015-03-15|website=Let's Queer Things Up!|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yellow represents people whose gender exists outside the binary, purple represents those who feel their gender is a mixture of – or between – male and female, black represents people who feel as if they have no gender,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and white represents those who embrace many or all genders.

Genderfluid people, who also fall under the genderqueer umbrella, have their own flag as well. Pink represents femininity, white represents lack of gender, purple represents mixed gender or androgyny, black represents all other genders, and blue represents masculinity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2016/09/gender-fluid-added-oxford-english-dictionary/|title=Gender-fluid added to the Oxford English Dictionary|newspaper=LGBTQ Nation|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agender people, who also sometimes identify as genderqueer, have their own flag. This flag uses black and white stripes to represent an absence of gender, and a green stripe to represent non-binary genders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manzella |first=Samantha |url=http://www.newnownext.com/guide-lgbt-flags/07/2017/ |title=Beyond The Rainbow: Your Guide To LGBT Flags |publisher=NewNowNext |date=2017-10-07 |accessdate=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
