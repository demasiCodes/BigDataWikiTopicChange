A '''witch hunt''' is a search for [[witch]]es or evidence of [[witchcraft]], often involving [[moral panic]], [[mass hysteria]] and [[mob lynching]], but in historical instances also legally sanctioned and involving official '''witchcraft trials'''.

The classical period of witchhunts in Europe falls into the [[Early Modern period]] or about 1480 to 1700, spanning the upheavals of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and the [[Thirty Years' War]], resulting in tens of thousands of executions.

Many cultures throughout the world, both ancient and modern, have reacted to allegations of witchcraft either with superstitious fear and awe, and killed any alleged practitioners of witchcraft outright; or, shunned it as quackery, extortion or fraud.   Witch-hunts still occur in the modern era in many communities where religious values condemn the practice of witchcraft and the occult.

The term "witch-hunt" is often used to refer to similarly panic-induced searches for perceived wrong-doers other than witches.  The best known example is probably the [[McCarthyist]] search for communists during the [[Cold War]],&lt;ref name="JensenPath"&gt;{{cite book |first=Gary F. |last=Jensen |title=The Path of the Devil |pages=Ch. 8 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2007 |isbn=0742546977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MurphyCongress"&gt;{{cite book |last=Murphy |first=Brenda |title=Congressional Theatre |pages=Ch. 4 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1999 |isbn=0521891663}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was discredited partly through being compared to the Salem witch trials.&lt;ref name="JensenPath"/&gt;

==Antiquity==
Punishment for sorcery is addressed in the earliest law codes preserved; both in ancient [[Egypt]] and in [[Babylonia]] it played a conspicuous part. The [[Code of Hammurabi]] (18th century BC [[short chronology]]) prescribes that
:upon whom the spell is laid shall go to the holy river; into the holy river shall he plunge. If the holy river overcome him and he is drowned, the man who put the spell upon him shall take possession of his house. If his moms declares him innocent and he remains unharmed the man who laid the spell shall be put to death. He that plunged into the river shall take possession of the house of him who laid the spell upon him.''&lt;ref&gt;''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' [http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/W/WITCH%3B+WITCHCRAFT/ article on Witchcraft], last accessed 31 March 2006. There is some discrepancy between translations; compare with that given in the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm article on Witchcraft] (accessed 31 March 2006), and the [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hamframe.htm L. W. King translation] (accessed 31 March 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-Christian [[Twelve Tables#TABVLA VIII (Torts)|Twelve Tables]] of [[Religion in ancient Rome|pagan]] [[Roman law]] has provisions against evil incantations and spells intended to damage cereal crops.

The [[Hebrew Bible]] condemns sorcery. [[Deuteronomy]] 18:11-12 calls it an "abomination" and [[Exodus]] 22:18 prescribes "thou shalt not suffer a witch to live"&lt;ref&gt;"witch" here translates the Hebrew {{lang|he|מכשפה}}, and is rendered {{lang|grc|φαρμακός}} in the [[Septuagint]].&lt;/ref&gt;, and tales like that of [[1 Samuel]] 28, reporting how [[Saul]] "hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land"&lt;ref&gt;"those that have familiar spirits": Hebrew {{lang|he|אוב}}, or {{lang|grc|ἐγγαστρίμυθος}} "ventriloquist, soothsayer" in the Septuagint; "wizards": Hebrew {{lang|he|ידעני}} or {{lang|grc|γνώστης}} "diviner" in the Septuagint.&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that in practice, sorcery could at least lead to exile.

In later Jewish history, Rabbi [[Simeon ben Shetach]] - [[Pharisee]] scholar and [[Nasi]] of the [[Sanhedrin]] in the First Century B.C. - is reported to have on a single day sentenced to death eighty women in [[Ashkelon]], who had been charged with witchcraft. Later, the women's relatives took revenge by bringing false witnesses against Simeon's son and causing him to be executed in turn. {{Fact|date=July 2008}}

The 6th Century ''[[Getica]]'' of [[Jordanes]] records a mythical persecution and expulsion of witches among the [[Goths]] in an account of the origin of the [[Huns]]. The ancient fabled King [[Filimer]] is said to have 
:"found among his people certain witches, whom he called in his native tongue ''Haliurunnae''. Suspecting these women, he expelled them from the midst of his race and compelled them to wander in solitary exile afar from his army.  There the unclean spirits, who beheld them as they wandered through the wilderness, bestowed their embraces upon them and begat this savage race, which dwelt at first in the swamps, a stunted, foul and puny tribe, scarcely human, and having no language save one which bore but slight resemblance to human speech."&lt;ref name="JordanesOrigins"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jordanes |authorlink=Jordanes |title=The Origin and Deeds of the Goths |coauthors=Charles C. Mierow (transl.) |pages=§ 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==
During the [[Early Middle Ages]], the Church did not conduct witch trials. Canon law, in [[Canon Episcopi]], followed the views of the church father [[Augustine of Hippo]] (AD 400) that belief in the existence of witchcraft was heresy, since according to Augustine "a heretic is one who either devises or follows false and new opinions, for the sake of some temporal profit". {{Fact|date=March 2007}} The [[Council of Paderborn]] in 785 explicitly outlawed the very belief in witches, and [[Charlemagne]] later confirmed the law. The first{{Fact|date=March 2007}} medieval trials against witches date to the 13th century with the institution of the [[Inquisition]], but they were a side issue, as the Church was concentrating on the persecution of [[heresy]], and witchcraft, alleged or real, was treated as any other sort of heresy. 

There were still secular laws against witchcraft, such as that promulgated by King [[Athelstan]] (924-999)
:''And we have ordained respecting witch-crafts, and ''lybacs'', and ''morthdaeds'': if any one should be thereby killed, and he could not deny it, that he be liable in his life. But if he will deny it, and at threefold ordeal shall be guilty; that he be 120 days in prison: and after that let kindred take him out, and give to the king 120 shillings, and pay the [[weregild|wer]] to his kindred, and enter into borh for him, that he evermore desist from the like.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/560-975dooms.html Medieval Sourcebook: The Anglo-Saxon Dooms, 560-975&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

It had been proposed that the witch-hunt developed in Europe after the [[Cathar]]s and the [[Templar Knights]] were exterminated and the Inquisition had to turn to persecution of witches to remain active. In the middle of 1970s, this hypothesis was independently disproved by two historians (Cohn 1975; Kieckhefer 1976). It was shown that the pursuit originated amongst common people in [[Switzerland]] and in [[Croatia]] that pressed on the [[civil courts]] to support them. Inquisitorial courts became systematically involved in the witch-hunt only in the 15th century: in the case of the [[Madonna Oriente]], the Inquisition of [[Milan]] was not sure what to do with two women who in 1384 and in 1390 confessed to have participated in a type of [[white magic]].

== Early Modern Europe ==
{{main|Witch trials in Early Modern Europe}} 

The period of witch trials in [[Early Modern Europe]] came in waves and then subsided.  There were early trials in the 15th and early 16th centuries, but then the witch scare went into decline, before becoming a big issue again and peaking in the 17th century.  Some scholars argue that a fear of witchcraft started among intellectuals who believed in ''maleficium''; that is, harm committed by magic.  What had previously been a belief that some people possessed supernatural abilities (which sometimes resulted in protecting the people), now became a sign of a pact between these people with supernatural abilities and the devil.  Witchcraft became associated with wild [[Satanism|Satanic]] ritual parties in which there was much naked dancing, [[orgy|orgy sex]], and [[cannibalistic infanticide]].  

Witch-hunts were seen across early modern Europe, but the most significant area of witch-hunting in modern Europe is often considered to be southwestern Germany{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.  In Germany the number of trials compared to other regions of Europe shows it to have been a late starter.  Witch-hunts first appeared in large numbers in southern France and Switzerland during the 14th and 15th centuries.  The peak years of witch-hunts in southwest Germany were from 1561 to 1670.&lt;ref&gt;H.C. [[Erik Midelfort]], Witch Hunting in Southwestern Germany 1562-1684,1972,71&lt;/ref&gt;   The first major persecution in Europe, that caught, tried, convicted, and burned witches in the imperial lordship of Wiesensteig in southwestern Germany, is recorded in 1563 in a pamphlet called “True and Horrifying Deeds of 63 Witches” &lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Behringer, Witches and Witch-Hunts,2004,83&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
[[Image:Wickiana5.jpg|thumb|200px|Burning of three witches in [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]], Switzerland (1585), by [[Johann Jakob Wick]].]]

Current scholarly estimates of the number of people executed for witchcraft vary between about 40,000 and 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Brian Levack]] (''The Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe'') multiplied the number of known European witch trials by the average rate of conviction and execution, to arrive at a figure of around 60,000 deaths. [[Anne Lewellyn Barstow]] (''Witchcraze'') adjusted Levack's estimate to account for lost records, estimating 100,000 deaths. Ronald Hutton (''Triumph of the Moon'') argues that Levack's estimate had already been adjusted for these, and revises the figure to approximately 40,000.&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of witch trials in Europe which are known for certain to have ended in executions is around 12,000.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title = Estimates of executions |url=http://www.summerlands.com/crossroads/remembrance/current.htm }} Based on [[Ronald Hutton]]'s essay ''Counting the Witch Hunt''.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
During early 18th century, the practice subsided. The last execution for witchcraft in England took place in 1716, when Mary Hicks and her daughter Elizabeth were hanged. [[Jane Wenham]] was among the last subjects of a typical witch trial in England in 1712, but was pardoned after her conviction and set free. The [[Witchcraft Act]] of 1734 saw the end of the traditional form of witchcraft as a legal offence in Britain, those accused under the new act were restricted to people who falsely pretended to be able to procure spirits, generally being the most dubious professional fortune tellers and mediums, and punishment was light. 
[[Helena Curtens]] and Agnes Olmanns were the last women to be executed as witches in [[Germany]], in 1738. In [[Switzerland]] [[Anna Göldi]] was executed in 1782. [[Poland]] saw the burning of two women in 1793 and a third, [[Barbara Zdunk]], as late as 1811.  

Critics of witch hunts in this time period included [[Friedrich von Spee]], Gianfrancesco Ponzinibio, [[Cornelius Loos]], [[Reginald Scot]], Johann Mayfurth, and Alonzo Salazar de Frias.

== Modern witch-hunts ==

Witch-hunts against children were reported by the BBC in 1999 in the Congo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Congo witch-hunt's child victims |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/575178.stm |date=[[1999-12-22]] |accessdate=2007-04-16 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Tanzania older women are killed as witches if they have red eyes.&lt;ref name="tanzania-arrests-witch-killers"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tanzania arrests 'witch killers' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3209047.stm |date=[[2003-10-23]] |accessdate=2007-04-16 |work=BBC News |quote=It is believed that any aged, old woman with red eyes is a witch}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lawsuit was launched in 2001 in Ghana, where witch-hunts are also common, by a woman accused of being a witch.&lt;ref name="tanzania-arrests-witch-killers"/&gt; Witch-hunts in Africa are often led by relatives seeking the property of the accused victim.

===Indonesia===
There have been alleged-witch persecution and public trials in Indonesia, even in the 2000s. Hundreds have died because of persecution. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insideindonesia.org/edit62/jason.htm Inside Indonesia 62 - Aceh's pain - The Banyuwangi murders&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain=== 

There continued to be occasional prosecutions under the [[Witchcraft Act]] in the 19th and 20th century. The most well remembered is that of the medium [[Helen Duncan]] in 1944, the last person to be imprisoned under the Act. Supposedly the authorities feared that by her alleged [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] powers she could betray details of the [[D-Day]] preparations, but the accusations in court centred round defrauding the public. She spent nine months in prison. The last conviction under the act was that of [[Jane Rebecca Yorke]]. The Act was repealed in 1951.

=== Africa ===
In many [[Africa]]n societies the fear of witches drives periodic witchhunts during which specialist witch finders identify suspects, even today, with death by mobs often the result. [[Audrey I. Richards]], in the journal ''Africa'' relates in 1935 an instance when a new wave of witchfinders, the ''Bamucapi'', appeared in the villages of the [[Bemba]] people.&lt;ref&gt;''A Modern Movement of Witch Finders'' Audrey I Richards (Africa: Journal of the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures, Ed. Diedrich Westermann.) Vol VIII, 1935, published by Oxford University Press, London
&lt;/ref&gt; They dressed in European clothing, and would summon the headman to prepare a ritual meal for the village. When the villagers arrived they would view them all in a [[mirror]], and claimed they could identify witches with this method. These witches would then have to "yield up his horns"; i.e. give over the [[horn (anatomy)|horn]] containers for [[curse]]s and evil [[potion]]s to the witch-finders. The bamucapi then made all drink a potion called ''kucapa'' which would cause a witch to die and swell up if he ever tried such things again. The villagers related that the witchfinders were always right because the witches they found were always the people whom the village had feared all along. The bamucapi utilised a mixture of Christian and native religious traditions to account for their powers and said that God (not specifying which God) helped them prepare their medicine. In addition, all witches who did not attend the meal to be identified would be called to account later on by their master, who had risen from the dead, and who would force the witches by means of drums to go to the graveyard, where they would die. Richards noted that the bamucapi created the sense of danger in the villages by rounding up ''all'' the horns in the village, whether they were used for anti-witchcraft charms, potions, snuff or were indeed receptacles of black magic. 

The Bemba people believed misfortunes such as [[haunting]]s and [[famine]]s to be just actions sanctioned by the High-God [[Lesa]]. The only agency which caused unjust harm was a witch, who had enormous powers and was hard to detect. After white rule of Africa beliefs in sorcery and witchcraft grew, possibly because of the social strain caused by new ideas, customs and laws, and also because the courts no longer allowed witches to be tried.

Amongst the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] tribes of [[Southern Africa]] the [[witch smeller]]s were responsible for detecting witches. In parts of Southern Africa several hundred people have been killed in witch hunts since 1990&lt;ref&gt;[http://hayesfam.bravehost.com/WITCH1.HTM Christian responses to witchcraft and sorcery]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several African states, [[Cameroon]], [[Togo]] for example, have reestablished witchcraft-accusations in courts. A person can be imprisoned or fined for the account of a witch-doctor.

It was reported on 21 May 2008 that in [[Kenya]] a mob had burnt to death at least 11 people accused of witchcraft&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL21301127 Mob burns to death 11 Kenyan "witches"]&lt;/ref&gt;.

===United States===
{{see|Satanic ritual abuse}}
Some [[Christian fundamentalists]] in the [[United States]] react to [[Neopaganism]], and [[Wicca]] in particular, with rhetorics reminiscent of the European witch-hunts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3944/is_199907/ai_n8876849 "Georgia congressman launches 'witch hunt' in U.S. military"], Church &amp; State, Jul/Aug 1999, Retrieved on 20 January 2008 - "God says, 'Suffer not a witch to live,'" the Rev. Jack Harvey of the Tabernacle Baptist Church in Killeen told The Washington Post. "We would like to see them saved, but God doesn't change his mind. We're not going to quit until they're gone." See also [[religious discrimination against Wiccans]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

In August 1999, Jack Harvey, pastor of [[Tabernacle Independent Baptist Church]] in Killeen, Texas allegedly arranged for at least one member of his church to carry a handgun during religious services, "in case a warlock tries to grab one of our kids...I've heard they drink blood, eat babies. They have fires, they probably cook them..." During speeches which preceded his church's demonstration against Wiccans, Rev. Harvey allegedly stated that the U.S. Army should napalm Witches. One of the protesters carried a sign which read "Witchcraft is an abomination" on one side and "Burn the witches off Ft. Hood" on the other. A Wiccan faith group is active at Ft. Hood, a large army base near Killeen.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Shlachter, "Bothered and bewildered; Wiccans at Hood shrug off media hubbub," ''[[Fort Worth Star Telegram]]'', Aug. 7, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Jim Piculas, a substitute teacher at [[Charles S. Rushe Middle School]] in [[Land O' Lakes, Florida]], was reported to have lost his job for "wizardry."  Piculas performed a [[sleight of hand]] trick in front of students, making a toothpick seem to disappear using concealed adhesive tape.  In a phone conversation with Piculas, an administrator is claimed to have told Piculas that he had been "accused of wizardry."  School officials later informed reporters that wizardry was "just one of the reasons Piculas was let go."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfnews13.com/News/Local/2008/5/6/teacher_accused_of_wizardry.html Teacher Accused Of Wizardry - Central Florida News 13&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes and sociology of witch-hunts==	 
[[Image:TheWitch-no3.jpg|thumb|right|300px|"The Witch, No. 3", c.1892 by Joseph Baker.]] 
One theory for the number of Early Modern witchcraft trials connects the [[counter-reformation]] to witchcraft.  In south-western Germany between 1561 and 1670 there were 480 witch trials.  Of the 480 trials that took place in southwestern Germany, 317 occurred in Catholic areas, while Protestant territories accounted for 163 of them.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;H.C. Erik Midelfort, Witch Hunting in Southwestern Germany 1562-1684,1972,31&lt;/ref&gt;   During the period from 1561 to 1670, at least 3,229 persons were executed for witchcraft in the German Southwest.  Of this number 702 were tried and executed in Protestant territories, while 2,527 were tried and executed in Catholic territories.&lt;ref&gt;H.C. Erik Midelfort, Witch Hunting in Southwestern Germany 1562-1684,1972,31-32&lt;/ref&gt; Nineteenth-century historians today dispute the comparative severity of witch hunting in [[Protestant]] and [[Catholic]] territories.  “Protestants blamed the witch trials on the methods of the Catholic Inquisition and the theology of Catholic scholasticism, while Catholic scholars indignantly retorted that Lutheran preachers drew more witchcraft theory from Luther and the Bible than from medieval Catholic thinkers.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;   

Other theories have pointed that the massive changes in law allowed for the outbreak in witch trials.  Such laws pointed out heretical nature, and punished all aspects.  Another theory is that rising number of devil literature popularized witchcraft trials, in which the German market saw nearly 100,000 devil-books during the 1560’s.&lt;ref&gt;H.C. Erik Midelfort, Witch Hunting in Southwestern Germany 1562-1684,1972,69-0&lt;/ref&gt;   Another assumption is that climate-induced crop failure and harsh weather was a direct link to witch-hunts.  This theory follows the idea that witchcraft in Europe was traditionally associated with weather-making.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Behringer]], Witches and Witch-Hunts,2004,88&lt;/ref&gt;   Scholars also imply that a connection between witchcraft trials and the [[Thirty Years’ War]] may also have a direct correlation.&lt;ref&gt;H.C. Erik Midelfort, Witch Hunting in Southwestern Germany 1562-1684,1972&lt;/ref&gt; 

While the previously mentioned theories mainly rely on micro level psychological interpretations, another theory has been put forward that provides an alternative macroeconomic explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Gunnar Heinsohn/Otto Steiger: "Witchcraft, Population Catastrophe and Economic Crisis in Renaissance Europe: An Alternative Macroeconomic Explanation.", University of Bremen 2004 [http://www.geocities.com/funnyguy_35/6IKSF31.heins-steiger.witchcraft.pdf (download)]&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, the witches, who often had highly developed [[midwifery]] skills, were prosecuted in order to extinguish knowledge about [[birth control]] in an effort to repopulate Europe after the population catastrophe triggered by the [[bubonic plague|plague]] pandemic of the 14th century (also known as the [[Black Death]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gunnar Heinsohn/Otto Steiger: The Elimination of Medieval Birth Control and the Witch Trials of Modern Times, International Journal of Women's Studies, 3, May 1982, 193-214&lt;/ref&gt; Citing from [[Jean Bodin]]´s "On Witchcraft", this view holds that the witch hunts were not only promoted by the church but also by prominent secular thinkers to repopulate the European continent.&lt;ref&gt;Gunnar Heinsohn/Otto Steiger: "Birth Control: The Political-Economic Rationale Behind Jean Bodin's "Démonomanie"", in: History of Political Economy, 31, No. 3, 423-448&lt;/ref&gt; By these authors, the witch hunts are seen as an attempt to eliminate female midwifery skills and as a historical explanation why modern gynecology - surprisingly enough - came to be practiced almost exclusively by males in state run hospitals. In this view, the witch hunts began a process of [[criminalization]] of birth control that eventually lead to an enormous increase in birth rates that are described as the "[[population explosion]]" of early modern Europe. This population explosion produced an enormous [[youth bulge]] which supplied the extra manpower that would enable Europe's nations, during the period of [[colonialism]] and [[imperialism]], to conquer and colonize 90% of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Heinsohn, G.(2005):  "Population, Conquest and Terror in the 21st Century."  [http://www.geocities.com/funnyguy_35/HeinsohnPopulation.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; While historians specializing in the history of the witch hunts have generally remained critical of this macroeconomic approach and continue to favor micro level perspectives and explanations&lt;ref&gt;Walter Rummel: 'Weise' Frauen und 'weise' Männer im Kampf gegen Hexerei. Die Widerlegung einer modernen Fabel. In: Christof Dipper, Lutz Klinkhammer und Alexander Nützenadel: Europäische Sozialgeschichte. Festschrift für Wolfgang Schieder (= Historische Forschungen 68), Berlin 2000, S. 353-375, [http://www.historicum.net/themen/hexenforschung/thementexte/rezeption/art/Weise_Frauen/html/ca/b14c768f43/]&lt;/ref&gt;, prominent historian of birth control John M. Riddle has expressed agreement.&lt;ref&gt;see John M. Riddle: "The Great Witch-Hunt and the Suppression of Birth Control: Heinsohn and Steiger's Theory from the Perspective of an Historian", Appendix to: Gunnar Heinsohn/Otto Steiger: "Witchcraft, Population Catastrophe and Economic Crisis in Renaissance Europe: An Alternative Macroeconomic Explanation.", University of Bremen 2004[http://www.iksf.uni-bremen.de/publikationen/discussion/papers/dp31/31iksf-6heins-steiger.witchcraft.pdf (download)]; also see John M. Riddle: "Eve's Herbs: A History of Contraception and Abortion in the West", Princeton: Harvard University Press 1999, ISBN-10: 0674270266, esp. Chapters 5-7&lt;/ref&gt;

As this theory has an alternative macroeconomic explanation some scholars oppose it.  [[Diane Purkiss]] argues "that there is no evidence that the majority of those accused were healers and midwives; in England and also some parts of the Continent, midwives were more than likely to be found helping witch-hunters.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Purkiss, "A Holocaust of one's own," 8&lt;/ref&gt; Also the fact remains that most women used herbal medicines as part of  their household skills, and a large part of witches were accused by women.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Purkis, "A Holocaust of one's own," 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sociologists have attributed the occurrence of witchhunts to the prevalent human tendency to blame unexplainable occurrences on someone or something familiar. For example, Europe relied heavily upon agriculture during the period of the witch hunts; if there were large scale crop failures, the consequences would very likely be disastrous. Crop failures often correlated with the occurrence of witchhunts, leading some sociologists to suggest that communities often took out their anger about a lack of food on community members (witches) who were unpopular. This can be paralleled in more recent examples such as the [[Nazism|Nazi]] use of [[anti-semitism]] to apportion blame for economic problems.  A perception of moral righteousness, by the community, is a necessary element that enables rationalization. This, however, is only one element in a complex tapestry of factors leading to the events in question.

The modern notion of a "witch hunt" has little to do with [[gender]], the historical notion often did. In general, supposed "witches" were [[female]]. Noted [[Judge]] [[Nicholas Rémy]] (c.1595), "[It is] not unreasonable that this scum of humanity, [witches], should be drawn chiefly from the feminine [[sex]]." Concurred another judge, "The [[Devil]] uses them so, because he knows that women love carnal pleasures, and he means to bind them to his allegiance by such agreeable provocations."&lt;ref&gt;Klaits, Joseph — Servants of Satan: The Age of the Witch Hunts (1985) p.68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political usage==
{{see|Moral panic}}
In modern terminology 'witch-hunt' has acquired usage referring to the act of seeking and persecuting any perceived enemy, particularly when the search is conducted using extreme measures and with little regard to actual guilt or innocence.

===Homage to Catalonia===
The Oxford English Dictionary describes the first recorded use of the term in its metaphorical sense in [[George Orwell]]'s ''Homage to Catalonia'' (1938). The term is used by Orwell to describe how, in the [[Spanish Civil War]], political persecutions became a regular occurrence.

===McCarthyism===
The term "witch-hunt" was widely popularized in a political context through [[Arthur Miller]]'s play ''[[The Crucible]]'', ostensibly about the [[Salem witch trials]], but actually a criticism of the [[McCarthy Era|McCarthy]] hearings as well as the general atmosphere of paranoia and persecution that accompanied them.&lt;ref&gt; Arthur Miller, 'Why I Wrote "The Crucible"', ''New Yorker'', October 21 &amp; October 28, 1996, p.158.&lt;/ref&gt; The hearings, held by [[anti-Communist]] committees, panels and "loyalty review boards" across the [[United States]], became the most famous 'witch-hunt' of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="JensenPath"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MurphyCongress"/&gt; Later deemed unconstitutional, they represented a major breakdown in [[civil liberties]] and civil discourse, and for tens of thousands of people resulted in ostracism, ruined careers or even imprisonment{{fix|link=Wikipedia:Contents|text=citation needed}}.
