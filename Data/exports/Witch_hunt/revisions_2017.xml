[[File:Wickiana5.jpg|thumb|[[Death by burning|Burning]] of three witches in [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]], Switzerland (1585), by [[Johann Jakob Wick]].]]

A '''witch-hunt''' is a search for persons labelled "witches" or evidence of [[witchcraft]], often involving [[moral panic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Erich Goode|author2=Nachman Ben-Yehuda|title=Moral Panics: The Social Construction of Deviance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SbY2Mksi1kcC&amp;pg=PA195|year=2010|publisher=Wiley |page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[mass hysteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lois Martin|title=A Brief History of Witchcraft|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mfPUIwtKG4cC&amp;pg=PA5|year=2010|publisher=Running Press|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Witch trials in the early modern period|classical period of witch-hunts]] in [[Early Modern Europe]] and [[Colonial North America]] took place in the [[Early Modern period]] or about 1450 to 1750, spanning the upheavals of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and the [[Thirty Years' War]], resulting in an estimated 35,000 to 100,000 executions.&lt;ref name="victim_stats" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Changing Identities in Early Modern France, Michael Wolfe, Duke University Press, 1997: pg. 220.
&lt;/ref&gt; Including illegal and summary executions it is estimated 200,000 or more "witches" were tortured, burnt or hanged in the Western world from 1500 until around 1800.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} The last executions of people convicted as witches in Europe took place in the 18th century. In other regions, like [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], contemporary witch-hunts have been reported from [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[Papua New Guinea]] and official legislation against witchcraft is still found in [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Cameroon]] today.

==Anthropological causes==
{{further information|Anthropology of religion|Human sacrifice}}
The wide distribution of the practice of witch-hunts in geographically and culturally separated societies (Europe, Africa, India, New Guinea) since the 1960s has triggered interest in the [[anthropological]] background of this behaviour. The belief in [[magical thinking|magic]] and [[divination]], and attempts to use magic to influence personal well-being (to increase life, win love, etc.) are human [[cultural universal]]s.

Belief in witchcraft has been shown to have similarities in societies throughout the world. It presents a framework to explain the occurrence of otherwise random misfortunes such as sickness or death, and the witch sorcerer provides an image of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Sybil La Fontaine, ''Speak of the devil: tales of satanic abuse in contemporary England'', Cambridge University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-521-62934-8}}, pp. 34–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Reports on indigenous practices in the Americas, Asia and Africa collected during the early modern [[age of exploration]] have been taken to suggest that not just the belief in witchcraft but also the periodic outbreak of witch-hunts are a human cultural universal.&lt;ref&gt;Witches and Witch-Hunts: A Global History. Wolfgang Behringer&amp;nbsp; (2004), 50. {{ISBN|9780745627175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study finds that witchcraft beliefs are associated with antisocial attitudes: lower levels of trust, charitable giving and group participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Witchcraft Beliefs and the Erosion of Social Capital: Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa and Beyond|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304387815001315|journal = Journal of Development Economics|doi = 10.1016/j.jdeveco.2015.11.005|first = Boris|last = Gershman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study finds that income shocks (caused by extreme rainfall) lead to a large increase in the murder of "witches" in Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Poverty and Witch Killing|url = http://restud.oxfordjournals.org/content/72/4/1153|journal = The Review of Economic Studies|date = 2005-10-01|issn = 0034-6527|pages = 1153–1172|volume = 72|issue = 4|doi = 10.1111/0034-6527.00365|first = Edward|last = Miguel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{further information|Magic in the ancient world}}

===Ancient Near East===

Punishment for malevolent [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] is addressed in the earliest [[law code]]s which were preserved; in both ancient [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Babylonia]], where it played a conspicuous part. The [[Code of Hammurabi]] (18th century BC [[short chronology]]) prescribes that
:"If a man has put a spell upon another man and it is not yet justified, he upon whom the spell is laid shall go to the holy river; into the holy river shall he plunge. If the holy river overcome him and he is drowned, the man who put the spell upon him shall take possession of his house. If the holy river declares him innocent and he remains unharmed the man who laid the spell shall be put to death. He that plunged into the river shall take possession of the house of him who laid the spell upon him."&lt;ref name="CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Witchcraft"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Witchcraft|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hamframe.htm|title=The Avalon Project : Documents in Law, History and Diplomacy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical antiquity===

In Classical Athens, no laws concerning magic survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Derek|title=Magic in the Ancient Greek World|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell|location=Malden|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, cases concerning the harmful effects of ''pharmaka'' – an ambiguous term that might mean "poison", "medicine", or "magical drug" – do survive, especially those where the drug caused injury or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Derek|title=Magic in the Ancient Greek World|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell|location=Malden|pages=133–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Antiphon (orator)|Antiphon]]'s speech ''[[Against the Stepmother for Poisoning]]'' tells of the case of a woman accused of plotting to murder her husband with a ''pharmakon''; a slave had previously been executed for the crime, but the son of the victim claimed that the death had been arranged by his stepmother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Derek|title=Magic in the Ancient Greek World|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell|location=Malden|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most detailed account of a trial for witchcraft in Classical Greece is the story of [[Theoris of Lemnos]], who was executed along with her children some time before 338 BC, supposedly for casting incantations and using harmful drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=Derek|title=Theoris of Lemnos and the Criminalization of Magic in Fourth-Century Athens|journal=The Classical Quarterly|volume=5|issue=1|year=2001|page=477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 451 BC, the [[Twelve Tables#TABVLA VIII (Torts)|Twelve Tables]] of [[Roman law]] had provisions against evil incantations and spells intended to damage cereal crops. In 331 BC, 170 women were executed as witches in the context of an [[Epidemic|epidemic illness]]. [[Livy]] emphasizes that this was a scale of persecution without precedent in Rome.

In 186 BC, the Roman senate issued a decree severely restricting the Bacchanals, ecstatic rites celebrated in honor of Dionysus. Livy records that this persecution was because "''there was nothing wicked, nothing flagitious, that had not been practiced among them''"&lt;ref name=Livy&gt;{{cite book |author=Livy|title=History of Rome, Book XXXIX|url=http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/livy39.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequent to the ban, in 184 BC, about 2,000 people were executed for witchcraft (''veneficium''), and in 182–180 BC another 3,000 executions took place,&lt;ref name=Durrant&amp;Bailey&gt;{{cite book |author1=Durrant, Jonathan Bryan |author2=Bailey, Michael David |title=Historical Dictionary of Witchcraft, 2nd ed|publisher=Scarecrow Press, Plymouth, UK|year=2012|pages=121–122 |isbn=978-0-8108-7245-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; again triggered by the outbreak of an epidemic. There is no way to verify the figures reported by Roman historians, but if they are taken at face value,{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} the scale of the witch-hunts in the [[Roman Republic]] in relation to the population of Italy at the time far exceeded anything that took place during the "classical" witch-craze in Early Modern Europe.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Persecution of witches continued in the [[Roman Empire]] until the late 4th century AD and abated only after the introduction of [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|Christianity]] as the Roman state religion in the 390s.&lt;ref name=Behringer&gt;{{cite book |author=Behringer, Wolfgang |title=Witches and Witch-Hunts: A Global History|publisher=Polity Press|year=2004|pages=48–50 |isbn=074562717X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficiis'' promulgated by [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] in 81 B.C. became an important source of late medieval and early modern European law on witchcraft. This law banned the trading and possession of harmful drugs and poisons, possession of magical books and other occult paraphernalia. [[Strabo]], [[Gaius Maecenas]] and [[Cassius Dio]] all reiterate the traditional Roman opposition against sorcery and divination, and [[Tacitus]] used the term ''religio-superstitio'' to class these outlawed observances. Emperor [[Augustus]] strengthened legislation aimed at curbing these practices, for instance in 31 B.C., by burning over 2,000 magical books in Rome, except for certain portions of the hallowed [[Sibylline Books]].&lt;ref name=Suetonius&gt;The Life of Augustus, by Suetonius&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Garnsey&gt;{{cite book |author1=Garnsey, Peter |author2=Saller, Richard P. |title=The Roman Empire: Economy, Society, and Culture |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California |year=1987 |pages=168–174 |isbn=0-520-06067-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In A.D. 354, whilst Tiberius Claudius was emperor, 45 men and 85 women, who were all suspected of sorcery, were executed.&lt;ref name=Ogden&gt;{{cite book |author=Ogden, Daniel|title=Magic, Witchcraft, and Ghosts in the Greek and Roman Worlds: A Sourcebook|publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, United Kingdom|year=2002|pages=283 |isbn=0-19-513575-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hebrew Bible]] condemns sorcery. [[Deuteronomy]] 18:10–12 states "No one shall be found among you who makes a son or daughter pass through fire, who practices divination, or is a soothsayer, or an [[augur]], or a [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]], or one that casts spells, or who consults ghosts or spirits, or who seeks oracles from the dead. For whoever does these things is abhorrent to the Lord;" and [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:18 prescribes "thou shalt not suffer a witch to live";&lt;ref&gt;"witch" here translates the Hebrew {{lang|he|מכשפה}}, and is rendered {{lang|grc|φαρμακός}} in the [[Septuagint]].&lt;/ref&gt; tales like that of [[1 Samuel|1&amp;nbsp;Samuel]] 28, reporting how [[Saul]] "hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land"&lt;ref&gt;"those that have familiar spirits": Hebrew {{lang|he|אוב}}, or {{lang|grc|ἐγγαστρίμυθος}} "ventriloquist, soothsayer" in the Septuagint; "wizards": Hebrew {{lang|he|ידעני}} or {{lang|grc|γνώστης}} "diviner" in the Septuagint.&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that in practice sorcery could at least lead to exile.

In the Judaean [[Second Temple Judaism|Second Temple period]], Rabbi [[Simeon ben Shetach]] in the 1st century BC is reported to have sentenced to death eighty women who had been charged with witchcraft on a single day in [[Ashkelon]]. Later the women's relatives took revenge by bringing (reportedly) false witnesses against Simeon's son and causing him to be executed in turn.&lt;ref&gt;''Yerushalmi [[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]]'', 6:6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late antiquity===

The 6th century AD ''[[Getica]]'' of [[Jordanes]] records a persecution and expulsion of witches among the [[Goths]] in a mythical account of the origin of the [[Huns]]. The ancient fabled King [[Filimer]] is said to have

:"found among his people certain witches, whom he called in his native tongue ''Haliurunnae''. Suspecting these women, he expelled them from the midst of his race and compelled them to wander in solitary exile afar from his army. There the unclean spirits, who beheld them as they wandered through the wilderness, bestowed their embraces upon them and begat this savage race, which dwelt at first in the swamps, a stunted, foul and puny tribe, scarcely human, and having no language save one which bore but slight resemblance to human speech."&lt;ref name="JordanesOrigins"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jordanes |authorlink=Jordanes |title=The Origin and Deeds of the Goths |translator=[[Charles C. Mierow]] |at=§ 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
{{further information|European witchcraft#History}}

====Christianisation in the Early Middle Ages====
The Councils of [[Synod of Elvira|Elvira]] (306), [[Synod of Ancyra|Ancyra]] (314), and [[Quinisext Council|Trullo]] (692) imposed certain ecclesiastical penances for devil-worship. This mild approach represented the view of the Church for many centuries. The general desire of the [[Catholic Church]]'s clergy to check fanaticism about witchcraft and [[necromancy]] is shown in the decrees of the [[Council of Paderborn]], which, in 785, explicitly outlawed condemning people as witches and condemned to death anyone who burnt a witch. The Lombard code of 643 states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Let nobody presume to kill a foreign serving maid or female servant as a witch, for it is not possible, nor ought to be believed by Christian minds.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hutton, Ronald]]. ''[[The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles]]''.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This conforms to the teachings of the [[Canon Episcopi]] of circa 900 AD (alleged to date from 314 AD), which, following the thoughts of [[Augustine of Hippo]], stated that witchcraft did not exist and that to teach that it was a reality was, itself, false and heterodox teaching. The [[Council of Frankfurt]] in 794, called by [[Charlemagne]], was also very explicit in condemning "the persecution of alleged witches and wizards", calling the belief in witchcraft "superstitious", and ordering the death penalty for those who presumed to burn witches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medspains.stanford.edu/demo/themes/adoptionism/frankfurt.html "A capitulary of Charlemagne (747–814) for the Saxons in 787 imposed the death penalty on those who, like pagans, believed that a man or woman could be a ''striga'', one who devours humans, and burned them.", Behringer, "Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History", p. 30 (2004). Wiley-Blackwell]&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include an Irish synod in 800,&lt;ref&gt;"Likewise, an Irish synod at around 800 condemned the belief in witches, and in particular those who slandered people for being ''lamias'' ('''que interpretatur striga''').", Behringer, "Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History", pp. 30–31 (2004). Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; and a sermon by [[Agobard|Agobard of Lyons]] (810).&lt;ref&gt;"A Crown witness of 'Carolingian skepticism', Archbishop Agobard of Lyon (769–840), reports witch panics during the reign of Charlemagne. In his sermon on hailstorms he reports frequent lynchings of supposed weather magicians (''tempestarii''), as well as of sorcerers, who were made responsible for a terrible livestock mortality in 810. According to Agobard, the common people in their fury over crop failure had developed the extravagant idea that foreigners were secretly coming with airships to strip their fields of crops, and transmit it to Magonia. These anxieties resulted in severe aggression, and on one occasion around 816, Agobard could hardly prevent a crowd from killing three foreign men and women, perceived as Magonian people. As their supposed homeland's name suggests, the crop failure was associated with magic. The bishop emphasized that thunderstorms were caused exclusively by natural or divine agencies.", Behringer, "Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History", pp. 54–55 (2004). Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coloman, King of Hungary|King Kálmán (Coloman) of Hungary]], in Decree 57 of his First Legislative Book (published in 1100), banned witch hunting because he said, "witches do not exist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bibleapologetics.wordpress.com/tag/witch-hunts-2/#_ftnref17|title=witch hunts - Bible Apologetics|publisher=}}
"A decree of King Coloman of Hungary (c. 1074–116, r. 1095–1116) against the belief in the existence of ''strigae'' (''De strigis vero que non sunt, ne ulla questio fiat'') suggests that they were thought to be human beings with demonic affiliation: witches.", Behringer, "Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History", p. 32 (2004). Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Decretum" of [[Burchard, Bishop of Worms]] (about 1020), and especially its 19th book, often known separately as the "Corrector", is another work of great importance. Burchard was writing against the superstitious belief in magical potions, for instance, that may produce impotence or abortion. These were also condemned by several Church Fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/abortion-contraception-and-the-church-fathers|title=Abortion, Contraception and the Church Fathers|work=National Catholic Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he altogether rejected the possibility of many of the alleged powers with which witches were popularly credited. Such, for example, were nocturnal riding through the air, the changing of a person's disposition from love to hate, the control of thunder, rain, and sunshine, the transformation of a man into an animal, the intercourse of [[incubi]] and [[succubi]] with human beings and other such superstitions. Not only the attempt to practice such things, but the very belief in their possibility, is treated by Burchard as false and superstitious.

[[Pope Gregory VII]], in 1080, wrote to King [[Harald III of Denmark]] forbidding witches to be put to death upon presumption of their having caused storms or failure of crops or pestilence. Neither were these the only examples of an effort to prevent unjust suspicion to which such poor creatures might be exposed.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See, for example, the ''Weihenstephan'' case discussed by Weiland in the ''Zeitschrift für Kirchengeschichte'', IX, 592.
"In 1080 Harold of Denmark (r. 1076–80) was admonished not to hold old women and Christian priests responsible for storms and diseases, or to slaughter them in the cruelest manner. Like Agobard before him, Pope Gregory VII (r. 1073–85) declared in his letter to the Danish king that these catastrophes were caused by God alone, that they were God's punishment for human sins, and that the killing of the innocent would only increase His fury.", Behringer, "Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History", p. 55 (2004). Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; On many different occasions, ecclesiastics who spoke with authority did their best to disabuse the people of their superstitious belief in witchcraft. This, for instance, is the general purport of the book, ''Contra insulsam vulgi opinionem de grandine et tonitruis'' ("Against the foolish belief of the common sort concerning hail and thunder"), written by [[Agobard]] (d. 841), [[Archbishop of Lyons]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques-Paul Migne|Migne]], ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'', CIV, 147&lt;/ref&gt; A comparable situation in [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|Russia]] is suggested in a sermon by  [[Serapion of Vladimir]] (written in 1274/5), where the popular superstition of witches causing crop failures is denounced.&lt;ref&gt;"Witches were executed at Novgorod in 1227, and after a severe famine in the years 1271-4 Bishop Serapion of Vladimir asked in a sermon: 'you believe in witchcraft and burn innocent people and bring down murder upon earth and the city... Out of what books or writings do you learn that famine in earth is brought about by witchcraft?'", Behringer, "Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History", p. 56 (2004). Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early secular laws against witchcraft include those promulgated by King [[Athelstan]] (924–939):

&lt;blockquote&gt;And we have ordained respecting witch-crafts, and ''lybacs'' ''[read ''lyblac'' "sorcery"]'', and ''morthdaeds ["murder, mortal sin"]'': if any one should be thereby killed, and he could not deny it, that he be liable in his life. But if he will deny it, and at threefold ordeal shall be guilty; that he be 120 days in prison: and after that let kindred take him out, and give to the king 120 shillings, and pay the [[weregild|wer]] to his kindred, and enter into borh for him, that he evermore desist from the like.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/560-975dooms.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In some prosecutions for witchcraft, torture (permitted by the [[Roman civil law]]) apparently took place. However, [[Pope Nicholas I]] (866), prohibited the use of torture altogether, and a similar decree may be found in the [[Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals]].&lt;ref name="CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Witchcraft"/&gt;

====Later Middle Ages====
[[File:Willisau 1447.JPG|thumb|200px|The burning of a woman in [[Willisau]], [[Switzerland]], 1447]]
The manuals of the Roman Catholic [[Inquisition]] remained highly skeptical of witch accusations, although there was sometimes an overlap between accusations of heresy and of witchcraft, particularly when, in the 13th century, the newly formed Inquisition was commissioned to deal with the [[Cathars]] of Southern France, whose teachings were charged with containing an admixture of witchcraft and magic. Although it has been proposed that the witch-hunt developed in Europe from the early 14th century, after the Cathars and the [[Templar Knights]] were suppressed, this hypothesis has been rejected independently by two historians (Cohn 1975; Kieckhefer 1976).

In 1258, [[Pope Alexander IV]] declared a canon that alleged witchcraft was not to be investigated by the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/dominicselwood/100269271/how-protestantism-fuelled-europes-deadly-witch-craze/ |title=How Protestantism fuelled Europe's deadly witch craze |author=[[Dominic Selwood]] |publisher=[[The Telegraph (website)|The Telegraph]]}} Quote: "There would be no witch persecutions of the sort he envisaged. The Gregorian Inquisition had been established to deal with the religious matter of heresy, not the secular issue of witchcraft. Pope Alexander IV spelled this out clearly in a 1258 canon which forbade inquisitions into sorcery unless there was also manifest heresy. And this view was even confirmed and acknowledged by the infamous inquisitor Bernard Gui (immortalised by Umberto Eco in The Name of the Rose), who wrote in his influential inquisitors’ manual that, by itself, sorcery did not come within the Inquisition's jurisdiction. In sum, the Church did not want the Inquisition sucked into witch trials, which were for the secular courts."&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Pope John XXII]] had later authorized the Inquisition to prosecute sorcerers in 1320,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeffrey Burton Russell]], ''A History of Medieval Christianity'' (173).&lt;/ref&gt; inquisitorial courts rarely dealt with witchcraft save incidentally when investigating heterodoxy.

In the case of the [[Madonna Oriente]], the Inquisition of [[Milan]] was not sure what to do with two women who in 1384 confessed to have participated the society around Signora Oriente or [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]. Through their confessions, both of them conveyed the traditional folk beliefs of white magic. The women were accused again in 1390, and condemned by the inquisitor. They were eventually executed by the secular arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Cohn |first=Norman |year=2000 |origyear=1993 |title=[[Europe's Inner Demons|Europe's Inner Demons: The Demonization of Christians in Medieval Christendom]] |edition=Rev. |publisher=University of Chicago Press |pages=173–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a notorious case in 1425, [[Hermann II, Count of Celje]] accused his daughter in law [[Veronika of Desenice]] of witchcraft – and, though she was acquitted by the court, he had her drowned. The accusations of witchcraft are, in this case, considered to have been a pretext for Hermann to get rid of an "unsuitable match", Veronika being born into the lower nobility and thus "unworthy" of his son.

A Catholic figure who preached against witchcraft was popular Franciscan preacher, [[Bernardino of Siena]] (1380–1444). Bernardino's sermons reveal both a phenomenon of superstitious practices and an over-reaction against them by the common people.&lt;ref&gt;See Franco Mormando, ''The Preacher's Demons: Bernardino of Siena and the Social Underworld of Early Renaissance Italy'', Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1999, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is clear that Bernardino had in mind not merely the use of spells and enchantments and such like fooleries but much more serious crimes, chiefly murder and infanticide. This is clear from his much-quoted sermon of 1427, in which he says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;One of them told and confessed, without any pressure, that she had killed thirty children by bleeding them ... [and] she confessed more, saying she had killed her own son ... Answer me: does it really seem to you that someone who has killed twenty or thirty little children in such a way has done so well that when finally they are accused before the Signoria you should go to their aid and beg mercy for them?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Transition to the early modern witch-hunts ====
[[File:12.Garden-Brutal Myths.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' (the 'Hammer against the Witches'), published in 1487, accused women of destroying men by planting bitter herbs throughout the field.]]
The resurgence of witch-hunts at the end of the medieval period, taking place with at least partial support or at least tolerance on the part of the Church, was accompanied with a number of developments in Christian doctrine, for example the recognition of the existence of witchcraft as a form of Satanic influence and its classification as a heresy. As [[Renaissance occultism]] gained traction among the educated classes, the belief in witchcraft, which in the medieval period had been part of the [[folk religion]] of the uneducated rural population at best, was  incorporated into an increasingly comprehensive theology of Satan as the ultimate source of all ''maleficium''.&lt;ref&gt;"Early Christian theologians attributed to the Devil responsibility for persecution, heresy, witchcraft, sin, natural disasters, human calamities, and whatever else went wrong. One tragic consequence of this was a tendency to demonize people accused of wrongs. At the instance of ecclesiastical leaders, the state burned heretics and witches, burning symbolizing the fate deserved by the demonic. Popular fears, stirred to fever pitch in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, sustained frenzied efforts to wipe out heretics, witches, and unbelievers, especially Jews.", Hinson, "Historical and Theological Perspectives on Satan", ''[[Review &amp; Expositor]]'' (89.4.475), (Fall 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Trevor-Roper has said that it was necessary for belief in the Kingdom of Satan to die before the witch theory could be discredited.", Larner, 'Crime of Witchcraft In Early Modern Europe', in Oldridge, 'The Witchcraft Reader', p. 211 (2002). Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; These doctrinal shifts were completed in the mid 15th century, specifically in the wake of the [[Council of Basel]] and centered on the [[Duchy of Savoy]] in the western Alps,&lt;ref&gt;"We are reasonably confident today that the 'classical' doctrine of witchcraft crystallized during the middle third of the 15th century, shortly after the Council of Basel, primarily within a western Alpine zone centred around the duchy of Savoy (Ostorero et al. 1999).", Behringer, "Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History", pp. 18–19 (2004). Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to an early series of witch trials by both secular and ecclesiastical courts in the second half of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;"By the end of the 15th century, scattered trials for witchcraft by both secular and ecclesiastical courts occurred in many places from the Pyrenees, where the Spanish Inquisition had become involved, to the North Sea.", Behringer, "Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History", pp. 18–19 (2004).

In 1484, [[Pope Innocent VIII]] issued ''[[Summis desiderantes affectibus]]'', a [[Papal bull]] authorizing the "correcting, imprisoning, punishing and chastising" of devil-worshippers who have "slain infants", among other crimes. He did so at the request of inquisitor [[Heinrich Kramer]], who had been refused permission by the local bishops in Germany to investigate.&lt;ref&gt;Levack, ''The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe'', (49)&lt;/ref&gt; However, historians such as [[Ludwig von Pastor]] insist that the bull neither allowed anything new nor was necessarily binding on Catholic consciences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig von Pastor]], ''The History of the Popes, from the Close of the Middle Ages'', Vol. 5, p. 349-350. Quote: "The Bull contains no dogmatic decision of any sort on witchcraft. It assumes the possibility of demoniacal influences on human beings which the Church has always maintained, but claims no dogmatic authority for its pronouncement on the particular cases with which it was dealing at the moment. The form of the document, which refers only to certain occurrences which had been brought to the knowledge of the Pope, sh[o]ws that it was not intended to bind any one to believe in the things mentioned in it. The question whether the Pope himself believed in them has nothing to do with the subject. His judgment on this point has no greater importance than attaches to a Papal decree in any other undogmatic question, e.g., on a dispute about a benefice. The Bull introduced no new element into the current beliefs about witchcraft. It is absurd to accuse it of being the cause of the cruel treatment of witches, when we see in the ''Sachsenspiegel'' that burning alive was already the legal punishment for a witch. All that Innocent VIII. did was to confirm the jurisdiction of the inquisitors over these cases. The Bull simply empowered them to try all matters concerning witchcraft, without exception, before their own tribunals, by Canon-law; a process which was totally different from that of the later trials. Possibly the Bull, in so far as it admonished the inquisitors to be on the alert in regard to witchcraft may have given an impetus to the prosecution of such cases; but it affords no justification for the accusation that it introduced a new crime, or was in any way responsible for the iniquitous horrors of the witch-harrying of later times."&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later in 1487, Kramer published the notorious ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' (lit., 'Hammer against the Evildoers') which, because of the newly invented printing presses, enjoyed a wide readership. The book was soon banned by the Church in 1490, and Kramer was [[censure]]d, but it was nevertheless reprinted in 14 editions by 1520 and became unduly influential in the secular courts. In 1538, the [[Spanish Inquisition]] cautioned its members not to believe what the ''Malleus'' said, even when it presented apparently firm evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Jolly, Raudvere, &amp; Peters(eds.), "Witchcraft and magic in Europe: the Middle Ages", page 241 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Modern Europe===
{{Main article|Witch trials in Early Modern Europe}}

[[File:Wickiana4.jpg|thumb|The torture used against accused witches, 1577.]]The witch trials in [[Early Modern Europe]] came in waves and then subsided. There were trials in the 15th and early 16th centuries, but then the witch scare went into decline, before becoming a major issue again and peaking in the 17th century.  What had previously been a belief that some people possessed supernatural abilities (which were sometimes used to protect the people) now became a sign of a pact between the people with supernatural abilities and the devil. To justify the killings, Protestant Christianity and its proxy secular institutions deemed witchcraft as being associated to wild [[Satanism|Satanic]] ritual parties in which there was much naked dancing and [[Blood libel|cannibalistic infanticide]].&lt;ref&gt;The Dark Side of Christian History by Helen Ellerbe.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also seen as [[heresy]] for going against the first of the [[ten commandments]] ("You shall have no other gods before me") or as [[Lèse majesté|violating majesty]], in this case referring to the divine majesty, not the worldly.&lt;ref&gt;Meewis, Wim (1992) De Vierschaar, Uitgevering Pelckmans, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Further scripture was also frequently cited, especially the Exodus decree that "thou shalt not suffer a witch to live" (Exodus 22:18), which many supported.

Witch-hunts were seen across early modern Europe, but the most significant area of witch-hunting in modern Europe is often considered to be central and southern Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/MainArticle.aspx?m=12341&amp;amid=12341|title=The History Today Archive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany was a late starter in terms of the numbers of trials, compared to other regions of Europe. Witch-hunts first appeared in large numbers in southern France and Switzerland during the 14th and 15th centuries. The peak years of witch-hunts in southwest Germany were from 1561 to 1670.&lt;ref&gt;H. C. Erik Midelfort, Witch Hunting in Southwestern Germany 1562–1684,1972,71.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wiesensteig witch trial|first major persecution]] in Europe, when witches were caught, tried, convicted, and burned in the imperial lordship of Wiesensteig in southwestern Germany, is recorded in 1563 in a pamphlet called "True and Horrifying Deeds of 63 Witches".&lt;ref&gt;Behringer (2004), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Witchcraft persecution spread to all areas of Europe, including Scotland and the northernmost periphery of Europe in northern Norway. Learned European ideas about witchcraft, demonological ideas, strongly influenced the hunt of witches in the North.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Witches of the North|last = Willumsen|first = Liv Helene|publisher = Brill|year = 2013|isbn = 9789004252912|location = Leiden|pages = 1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Denmark, the burning of witches increased following the [[Protestant Reformation|reformation]] of 1536. [[Christian IV of Denmark]], in particular, encouraged this practice, and hundreds of people were convicted of [[witchcraft]] and burnt. In the district of Finnmark, northern Norway, severe witchcraft trials took place during the period 1600-1692.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Witchcraft Trials in Finnmark, northern Norway|last = Willumsen|first = Liv Helene|publisher = Skald|year = 2010|isbn = 978-82-7959-152-8|location = Bergen|pages = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial of international format, ''Steilneset Memorial'', has been built to commemorate the victims of the Finnmark witchcraft trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 'Introduction' in Steilneset Memorial.

In the [[North Berwick witch trials]] in Scotland, over 70 people were accused of witchcraft on account of bad weather when [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland]], who shared the Danish king's interest in witch trials, sailed to Denmark in 1590 to meet his betrothed [[Anne of Denmark]]. The [[Pendle witch trials]] of 1612 are among the most famous witch trials in English history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/lancashire/hi/things_to_do/newsid_8316000/8316766.stm|title=BBC - Lancashire - Follow the Pendle Witches trail|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bamberger Malefizhaus 1627 Staatsbiblithek Bamberg.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Malefizhaus'' of [[Bamberg, Germany]], where suspected witches were held and interrogated. 1627 engraving.]]In England, witch-hunting would reach its apex in 1644 to 1647 due to the work of [[Matthew Hopkins]]. Although operating without an official Parliament commission, Hopkins (calling himself Witchfinder General) and his accomplices charged hefty fees to towns during the [[English Civil War]]. Hopkins' witch hunting spree was brief but significant: 300 convictions and deaths are attributed to his work.&lt;ref name="sharpe"&gt;Sharpe, James (2002), "The Lancaster witches in historical context", in Poole, Robert, The Lancashire Witches: Histories and Stories, Manchester University Press, pp. 1–18, {{ISBN|978-0-7190-6204-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2017}} Hopkins wrote a book on his methods, describing his fortuitous beginnings as a witch hunter, the methods used to extract confessions, and the tests he employed to test the accused: stripping them naked to find the [[Witches' mark]], [[Dunking|the "swimming" test]], and [[Pricking|pricking the skin]]. The swimming test, which included throwing a witch into water strapped to a chair to see if she floated, was discontinued in 1645 due to a legal challenge. The 1647 book, ''The Discovery of Witches'', was soon influential in legal texts. The book was used in the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] as early as May 1647, when [[Margaret Jones (Puritan midwife)|Margaret Jones]] was executed for witchcraft in [[Connecticut]],&lt;ref name="Jewett"&gt;Jewett, Clarence F. ''The Memorial History of Boston: Including Suffolk County, Massachusetts. 1630–1880.'' Ticknor and Company. 1881 Pgs. 133–137&lt;/ref&gt; the first of 17 people executed for witchcraft in the Colonies from 1647 to 1663.&lt;ref name="Fraden" /&gt;

Witch-hunts in North America began about the time of Hopkins. In 1645, forty-six years before the notorious [[Salem witch trials]], [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] experienced America's first accusations of [[witchcraft]] when husband and wife Hugh and Mary Parsons accused each other of witchcraft. In America's first witch trial, Hugh was found innocent, while Mary was acquitted of witchcraft but she was still sentenced to be hanged as punishment for the death of her child. She died in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/history/index.ssf/2011/05/springfields_375th_from_puritans_to_presidents.html|title=Springfield's 375th: From Puritans to presidents|work=masslive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; About eighty people throughout England's [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Bay Colony]] were accused of practicing witchcraft; thirteen women and two men were executed in a witch-hunt that occurred throughout [[New England Colonies|New England]] and lasted from 1645–1663.&lt;ref name="Fraden"&gt;Fraden, Judith Bloom, Dennis Brindell Fraden. ''The Salem Witch Trials''. Marshall Cavendish. 2008. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Salem witch trials]] followed in 1692–93.

Once a case was brought to trial, the prosecutors hunted for accomplices. Magic was not considered to be wrong because it failed, but because it worked effectively for the wrong reasons. Witchcraft was a normal part of everyday life. Witches were often called for, along with religious ministers, to help the ill or to deliver a baby. They held positions of spiritual power in their communities. When something went wrong, no one questioned the ministers or the power of the witchcraft. Instead, they questioned whether the witch intended to inflict harm or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Peter G.|title=The Long European Reformation|year=2004|publisher=PALGRAVE MACMILLAN|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-333-64451-5|pages=210–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current scholarly estimates of the number of people executed for witchcraft vary between about 40,000 and 100,000.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Brian P. Levack]] (''The Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe'') multiplied the number of known European witch trials by the average rate of conviction and execution, to arrive at a figure of around 60,000 deaths. [[Anne Lewellyn Barstow]] (''Witchcraze'') adjusted Levack's estimate to account for lost records, estimating 100,000 deaths. Ronald Hutton (''Triumph of the Moon'') argues that Levack's estimate had already been adjusted for these, and revises the figure to approximately 40,000; Monter estimates 35,000 deaths.

Modern scholarly estimates place the total number of executions for witchcraft in the 300-year period of European witch-hunts in the five digits, mostly at roughly between 40,000 and 50,000 (see table below for details),&lt;ref name="victim_stats"&gt;William Monter estimates 35,000 deaths,  Malcolm Gaskill at 40,000–50,000.

Turner and Charles Edgley, “From Witchcraft to Drugcraft: Biochemistry as Mythology,” Social Science Journal No. 20, October 1983, pg 1. Estimated 500,000 accused witches killed.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of those accused were from the lower economic classes in European society, although in rarer cases high-ranking individuals were accused as well. On the basis of this evidence, Scarre and Callow asserted that the "typical witch was the wife or widow of an agricultural labourer or small tenant farmer, and she was well known for a quarrelsome and aggressive nature."

While it appears to be the case that the clear majority of victims in Germany were women, in other parts of Europe the witch-hunts targeted primarily men, thus in Iceland 92% of the accused were men, in Estonia 60%, and in Moscow two-thirds of those accused were male.

At one point during the Würzburg trials of 1629, children made up 60% of those accused, although this had declined to 17% by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Scarre, Geoffrey; Callow, John (2001). Witchcraft and Magic in Sixteenth and Seventeenth-Century Europe (second ed.). Basingstoke: Palgrave, pp. 29&amp;ndash;33.

[[File:T. Colley, The remarkable confession... Wellcome M0013388.jpg|thumb|200px|The drowning of an alleged witch, with [[Thomas Colley]] as the incitor.]]
In England and Scotland between 1542 and 1735, a series of [[Witchcraft Acts]] enshrined into law the punishment (often with death, sometimes with [[incarceration]]) of individuals practising or claiming to practice witchcraft and magic.&lt;ref name="Gibson"&gt;{{cite book |first=M |last=Gibson |contribution=Witchcraft in the Courts |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fyI9xo1GvGAC&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages=1–18 |editor-first=Marion |editor-last=Gibson |title=Witchcraft And Society in England And America, 1550–1750 |year=2006 |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]] |isbn=978-0-8264-8300-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last executions for witchcraft in England had taken place in 1682, when Temperance Lloyd, Mary Trembles, and Susanna Edwards were executed at Exeter.

===India===

India has had a long history of witch-hunts both preceding the British rule and after it. The earliest evidence of witch-hunts in India can be found in the Santhal witch trials in 1792. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite book |last= Archer |first= W G |date=1979 |title=The Santals: Readings in Tribal Life |location= New Delhi |publisher= Concept Publishing Company }} &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; {{cite book |last= Crooke|first=W |date= 1969|title= The Popular Religion and Folklore of Northern India|location=Delhi |publisher= Munshiram Manoharlal }} &lt;/ref&gt; In the Singhbhum district of the Chhotanagpur division in British India, not only were those accused of being witches murdered, but also those related to the accused to ensure that they won’t avenge the deaths (Roy Choudhary 1958: 88). The Chhotanagpur region was majorly populated by an adivasi population called the Santhals. The existence of witches was a belief central to the Santhals. Witches were feared and were supposed to be engaged in anti-social activities. They were also supposed to have the power to kill people by feeding on their entrails, and causing fevers in cattle among other evils. Therefore, according to the adivasi population the cure to their disease and sickness was the elimination of these witches who were seen as the cause.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last=Sinha |first= Shashank|title= Witch hunts, Adivasis, and the Uprising in Chhotanagpur |url= http://www.jstor.org/stable/4419566 |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=42 |issue= 19|pages= 1672-1676|}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of witch hunt among Santhals was more brutal than that in Europe. Unlike Europe where witches were strangulated before being burnt, the santhals forced them “..to eat human excreta and drink blood before throwing them into the flames.” &lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last= Varma|first=Daya |title= Witch-Hunt among Santhals |url= http://www.jstor.org/stable/4419670 |journal=Economicand Political Weekly |volume=42 |issue=23 |pages= 2130|}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The British banned the persecution of witches in Gujarat, Rajasthan and Chhotanagpur in the 1840s-1850s. They saw the practise as barbaric and tried to dismantle the belief in witchcraft by providing medical facilities. However, they undermined the extent to which the belief was socially embedded. Despite the ban, very few cases were reported as witch-hunting was not seen as a crime. The Santhals believed that the ban in fact allowed the witches to flourish. Thus, the effect of the ban was contrary to what the British had intended. During 1857-58, there was a surge in witch hunting.

Witch hunts still occur today in societies where belief in [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] is prevalent. In most cases, these are instances of [[lynching]] and burnings, reported with some regularity from much of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], from rural [[North India]] and from Papua New Guinea. In addition, there are some countries that have legislation against the practice of sorcery. The only country where witchcraft remains legally punishable by [[death penalty|death]] is Saudi Arabia.

Witch hunts in modern times are continuously reported by the [[UNHCR]] of the [[United Nations Organization|UNO]] as a massive violation of human rights. Most of the accused are women and children but can also be elderly people or marginalised groups of the community such as [[albino]]s and the [[HIV]]-infected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home/opendocPDFViewer.html?docid=4981ca712|title=UNHCR Research Paper No. 169 Witchcraft allegations, refugee protection and human rights: a review of the evidence, January 2009|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|work=UNHCR}}&lt;/ref&gt; These victims are often considered burdens to the community, and as a result are often driven out, starved to death, or killed violently, sometimes by their own families in acts of [[social cleansing]].&lt;ref&gt;Miguel, Edward. "Poverty and Witch Killing." The Review of Economic Studies 72, no. 4 (1 October 2005): 1153–72&lt;/ref&gt; The causes of witch hunts include poverty, epidemics, social crises and lack of education. The leader of the witch hunt, often a prominent figure in the community or a "witch doctor",  may also gain economic benefit by charging for an [[exorcism]] or by selling body parts of the murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/4d346eab9.html|title=UNHCR Research Paper No. 197 Breaking the spell: responding to witchcraft accusations against children, January 2011|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|work=UNHCR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/4d346eab9.html|title=UNHCR Research Paper No. 235 Seeking meaning: an anthropological and community-based approach to witchcraft accusations and their prevention in refugee situations, May 2012|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|work=UNHCR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
{{Further information|Witchcraft accusations against children in Africa}}

In many societies of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the fear of witches drives periodic witch-hunts during which specialist witch-finders identify suspects, with death by mob often the result.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?14+Duke+J.+Comp.+&amp;+Int%27l+L.+351#H2N1&lt;/ref&gt; Countries particularly affected by this phenomenon include [[South Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ally|first=Yaseen|title=Witch Hunts in Modern South Africa|url=http://www.mrc.ac.za/crime/witch-hunts.pdf|publisher=MRC|date=June 2009|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cameroon]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Zambia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=de Waal|first=Mandy|title=Witch-hunts: The darkness that won't go away|url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-05-30-witch-hunts-the-darkness-that-wont-go-away/#.UqWZe9IW2yg|accessdate=9 December 2013|newspaper=Daily Maverick|date=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Witch-hunts against children were reported by the BBC in 1999 in the Congo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Congo witch-hunt's child victims |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/575178.stm |date=22 December 1999 |accessdate=2007-04-16 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Tanzania, where the government responded to attacks on women accused of being witches for having red eyes.&lt;ref name="tanzania-arrests-witch-killers"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tanzania arrests 'witch killers' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3209047.stm |date=23 October 2003 |accessdate=2007-04-16 |work=BBC News |quote=It is believed that any aged, old woman with red eyes is a witch}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lawsuit was launched in 2001 in Ghana, where witch-hunts are also common, by a woman accused of being a witch.&lt;ref name="tanzania-arrests-witch-killers"/&gt; Witch-hunts in Africa are often led by relatives seeking the property of the accused victim.

[[Audrey I. Richards]], in the journal ''Africa'', relates in 1935 an instance when a new wave of witchfinders, the ''Bamucapi'', appeared in the villages of the [[Bemba people]] of Zambia.&lt;ref&gt;''A Modern Movement of Witch Finders'' Audrey I Richards (Africa: Journal of the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures, Ed. Diedrich Westermann.) Vol VIII, 1935, published by Oxford University Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt; They dressed in European clothing, and would summon the headman to prepare a ritual meal for the village. When the villagers arrived they would view them all in a [[mirror]], and claimed they could identify witches with this method. These witches would then have to "yield up his horns"; i.e. give over the [[horn (anatomy)|horn]] containers for [[curse]]s and evil [[potion]]s to the witch-finders. The bamucapi then made all drink a potion called ''kucapa'' which would cause a witch to die and swell up if he ever tried such things again.

The villagers related that the witch-finders were always right because the witches they found were always the people whom the village had feared all along. The bamucapi utilised a mixture of Christian and native religious traditions to account for their powers and said that God (not specifying which God) helped them to prepare their medicine. In addition, all witches who did not attend the meal to be identified would be called to account later on by their master, who had risen from the dead, and who would force the witches by means of drums to go to the graveyard, where they would die. Richards noted that the bamucapi created the sense of danger in the villages by rounding up ''all'' the horns in the village, whether they were used for anti-witchcraft charms, potions, snuff or were indeed receptacles of black magic.

The Bemba people believed misfortunes such as [[wart]]ings, [[haunting]]s and [[famine]]s to be just actions sanctioned by the High-God Lesa. The only agency which caused unjust harm was a witch, who had enormous powers and was hard to detect. After white rule of Africa, beliefs in sorcery and witchcraft grew, possibly because of the social strain caused by new ideas, customs and laws, and also because the courts no longer allowed witches to be tried.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Amongst the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] tribes of Southern Africa, the [[witch smeller]]s were responsible for detecting witches. In parts of Southern Africa, several hundred people have been killed in witch hunts since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hayesfam.bravehost.com/WITCH1.HTM|title=Expired Website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cameroon]] has re-established witchcraft-accusations in courts after its independence in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;

A person convicted of witchcraft may face a prison term of 2 to 10 years and a fine. {{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,IRBC,,CMR,440ed6e819,0.html |title=Cameroon: Witchcraft in Cameroon; tribes or geographical areas in which witchcraft is practised; the government's attitude |publisher= [[UNHCR]] |year=2004}}

Whereas witchcraft cases in the colonial era, especially in former British Central Africa, were based on the official dogma that witchcraft is an illusion (so that people invoking witchcraft would be punished as either impostors or slanderers), in contemporary legal practice in Africa witchcraft appears as a reality and as an actionable offence in its own right. {{cite web |first= Wim |last=van Binsbergen |url= http://www.shikanda.net/african_religion/witchtxt.htm |publisher=Shikanda.net |title=Witchcraft in Modern Africa |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, Amnesty International reported that up to 1,000 people in the Gambia had been abducted by government-sponsored "witch doctors" on charges of witchcraft, and taken to detention centers where they were forced to drink poisonous concoctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/gambia-hundreds-accused-%E2%80%9Cwitchcraft%E2%80%9D-and-poisoned-government-campaign-20|title=The Gambia: Hundreds accused of "witchcraft" and poisoned in government campaign|date=18 March 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 May 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the alleged witch-hunting campaign had been sparked by the Gambian President, [[Yahya Jammeh]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/world/africa/21gambia.html?ref=africa&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sierra Leone, the witch-hunt is an occasion for a sermon by the ''kɛmamɔi'' (native [[Mende people|Mende]] witch-finder) on social ethics : "Witchcraft ... takes hold in people’s lives when people are less than fully open-hearted. All wickedness is ultimately because people hate each other or are jealous or suspicious or afraid. These emotions and motivations cause people to act antisocially".&lt;ref&gt;''Studia Instituti Anthropos'', Vol. 41. Anthony J. Gittins : ''Mende Religion''. Steyler Verlag, Nettetal, 1987. p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; The response by the populace to the ''kɛmamɔi'' is that "they valued his work and would learn the lessons he came to teach them, about social responsibility and cooperation."&lt;ref&gt;''Studia Instituti Anthropos'', Vol. 41. Anthony J. Gittins : ''Mende Religion''. Steyler Verlag, Nettetal, 1987. p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

===South-Central Asia===
In [[India]], labeling a woman as a witch is a common ploy to grab land, settle scores or even to punish her for turning down sexual advances. In a majority of the cases, it is difficult for the accused woman to reach out for help and she is forced to either abandon her home and family or driven to commit suicide. Most cases are not documented because it is difficult for poor and illiterate women to travel from isolated regions to file police reports. Less than 2% of those accused of witch-hunting are actually convicted, according to a study by the Free Legal Aid Committee, a group that works with victims in the state of Jharkhand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womensenews.org/story/the-world/070716/recourse-rare-witch-hunt-victims-in-india|title=Recourse Rare for Witch Hunt Victims in India – Women's eNews|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victims of this form of violence are often beaten, tortured, publicly humiliated, and murdered. Sometimes, the family members of the accused are also assaulted.&lt;ref name="whrin.org"/&gt;

===Papua New Guinea===
Though the practice of "white" magic (such as [[faith healing]]) is legal in Papua New Guinea, the 1976 Sorcery Act imposed a penalty of up to 2 years in prison for the practice of [[black magic|"black" magic]], until the Act was repealed in 2013. In 2009, the government reports that extrajudicial torture and murder of alleged witches – usually lone women – are spreading from the highland areas to cities as villagers migrate to urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/unreported-world/episode-guide/series-2009/episode-9.|title=Unreported World|work=Channel 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in June 2013, four women were accused of witchcraft because the family "had a 'permanent house' made of wood, and the family had tertiary educations and high social standing".&lt;ref name="2013 witch burning in New Guinea"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.yahoo.com/witch-hunts-papua-guinea-linked-jealousy-054301668.html | title=Witch hunts in Papua New Guinea linked to jealousy | agency=Associated Press | date=10 June 2013 | accessdate=10 June 2013 | author=McGuirk, Rod}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the women were tortured and Helen Rumbali was beheaded.&lt;ref name="2013 witch burning in New Guinea"/&gt; Helen Hakena, chairwoman of the North Bougainville Human Rights Committee, said that the accusations started because of economic jealousy born of a mining boom.&lt;ref name="2013 witch burning in New Guinea"/&gt;

The frequency of prosecutions for this in the country as whole is unknown.
