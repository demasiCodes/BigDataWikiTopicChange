A '''witch-hunt''' is a search for [[witch]]es or evidence of [[witchcraft]], often involving [[moral panic]], [[mass hysteria]] and [[lynching]], but in historical instances also legally sanctioned and involving official '''witchcraft trials'''.

The [[Witch trials in the Early Modern period|classical period of witchhunts in Europe and North America]] falls into the [[Early Modern period]] or about 1480 to 1700, spanning the upheavals of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and the [[Thirty Years' War]], resulting in an estimated 40,000 to 100,000 executions. &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Brian Levack]] (''The Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe'') multiplied the number of known European witch trials by the average rate of conviction and execution, to arrive at a figure of around 60,000 deaths. [[Anne Lewellyn Barstow]] (''Witchcraze'') adjusted Levack's estimate to account for lost records, estimating 100,000 deaths. Ronald Hutton (''Triumph of the Moon'') argues that Levack's estimate had already been adjusted for these, and revises the figure to approximately 40,000. &lt;/ref&gt; The most common estimates are 40,000-60,000.

The last executions of people convicted as witches in [[Europe]] took place in the 18th century. In the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], witchcraft ceased to be an act punishable by law with the [[Witchcraft Act of 1735]]. In [[18th century history of Germany|Germany]], sorcery remained punishable by law into the late 18th century.

Contemporary witch-hunts are reported from [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], [[India]] and [[Papua New Guinea]]. Official legislation against witchcraft is still found in [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Cameroon]].

The term "[[:wikt:witch-hunt|witch-hunt]]" since the 1930s has also been in use as a metaphor to refer to moral panics in general (frantic persecution of perceived enemies). This usage is especially associated with the [[Second Red Scare]] of the 1950s (the [[McCarthyist]] persecution of communists in the United States). 

==History==
===Antiquity===
Punishment for [[sorcery]] and witchcraft is addressed in the earliest [[law code]]s preserved; both in ancient [[Egypt]] and in [[Babylonia]] it played a conspicuous part (although in the example below it appears that only unjustified spells are to be punished). The [[Code of Hammurabi]] (18th century [[BCE]] [[short chronology]]) prescribes that
:''If a man has put a spell upon another man and it is not justified, he upon whom the spell is laid shall go to the holy river; into the holy river shall he plunge. If the holy river overcome him and he is drowned, the man who put the spell upon him shall take possession of his house. If the holy river declares him innocent and he remains unharmed the man who laid the spell shall be put to death. He that plunged into the river shall take possession of the house of him who laid the spell upon him. ''&lt;ref&gt;''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' [http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/W/WITCH%3B+WITCHCRAFT/ article on Witchcraft], last accessed 31 March 2006. There is some discrepancy between translations; compare with that given in the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm article on Witchcraft] (accessed 31 March 2006), and the [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hamframe.htm L. W. King translation] (accessed 31 March 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-Christian [[Twelve Tables#TABVLA VIII (Torts)|Twelve Tables]] of [[Religion in ancient Rome|pagan]] [[Roman law]] has provisions against evil incantations and spells intended to damage cereal crops. In 331 BC, 170 women were executed as witches in the context of an [[Epidemic|epidemic illness]]. [[Livy]] emphasizes that this was a scale of persecution without precedent in Rome, but smaller-scale witch-hunts. In 184 BC, about 2,000 people were executed for witchcraft (''veneficium''), and in 182-180 BC another 3,000 executions took place, again triggered by the outbreak of an epidemic. There is no way to verify the figures reported by Roman historiographers, but if they are taken at face value, the scale of the witch-hunts in the [[Roman Republic]] in relation to the population of [[Italy]] at the time far exceeded anything that took place during the "classical" witch-craze in Early Modern Europe. Persecution of witches continued in the [[Roman Empire]] until the late 4th century AD and abated only after the introduction of [[Roman Christianity|Christianity]] as the Roman state religion in the 390s. &lt;ref&gt;Behringer (2004), 48-50.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficiis'' promulgated by [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] in the 2nd century BC became an important source of late medieval and early modern European law on witchcraft. [[Strabo]], [[Gaius Maecenas]] and [[Cassius Dio]] all reiterate the traditional Roman opposition against sorcery and divination, and [[Tacitus]] uses the term ''religio-superstitio'' to class these outlawed observances. The emperor [[Augustus]] strengthened legislation aimed at curbing these practices. &lt;ref name = Garnsey&gt;{{cite book |author=Garnsey, Peter; Saller, Richard P. |title=The Roman Empire: Economy, Society, and Culture |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California |year=1987 |pages=168–174 |isbn=0-520-06067-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hebrew Bible]] condemns sorcery. [[Deuteronomy]] 18:10-12 states "No one shall be found among you who makes a son or daughter pass through fire, who practices divination, or is a soothsayer, or an augur, or a sorcerer, or one that casts spells, or who consults ghosts or spirits, or who seeks oracles from the dead. For whoever does these things is abhorrent to the Lord;" and [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:18 prescribes "thou shalt not suffer a witch to live"; &lt;ref&gt;"witch" here translates the Hebrew {{lang|he|מכשפה}}, and is rendered {{lang|grc|φαρμακός}} in the [[Septuagint]]. &lt;/ref&gt; tales like that of [[1 Samuel|1&amp;nbsp;Samuel]] 28, reporting how [[Saul]] "hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land"&lt;ref&gt;"those that have familiar spirits": Hebrew {{lang|he|אוב}}, or {{lang|grc|ἐγγαστρίμυθος}} "ventriloquist, soothsayer" in the Septuagint; "wizards": Hebrew {{lang|he|ידעני}} or {{lang|grc|γνώστης}} "diviner" in the Septuagint.&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that in practice sorcery could at least lead to exile.

In later Jewish history, Rabbi [[Simeon ben Shetach]] - [[Pharisee]] scholar and [[Nasi]] of the [[Sanhedrin]] in the 1st century [[BCE]] - is reported to have sentenced to death 80 women, who had been charged with witchcraft, on a single day in [[Ashkelon]]. Later the women's relatives took revenge by bringing (reportedly) false witnesses against Simeon's son and causing him to be executed in turn.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

The 6th century [[Common Era|CE]] ''[[Getica]]'' of [[Jordanes]] records a persecution and expulsion of witches among the [[Goths]] in a mythical account of the origin of the [[Huns]]. The ancient fabled King [[Filimer]] is said to have 
:"found among his people certain witches, whom he called in his native tongue ''Haliurunnae''. Suspecting these women, he expelled them from the midst of his race and compelled them to wander in solitary exile afar from his army. There the unclean spirits, who beheld them as they wandered through the wilderness, bestowed their embraces upon them and begat this savage race, which dwelt at first in the swamps, a stunted, foul and puny tribe, scarcely human, and having no language save one which bore but slight resemblance to human speech."&lt;ref name="JordanesOrigins"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jordanes |authorlink=Jordanes |title=The Origin and Deeds of the Goths |coauthors=[[Charles C. Mierow]] (transl.) |pages=§ 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
The [[Council of Paderborn]] in 785 explicitly outlawed the very belief in witches, and [[Charlemagne]] later confirmed the law. The [[Council of Frankfurt]] in 794, called by Charlemagne, was also very explicit in condemning "the persecution of alleged witches and wizards", calling the belief in witchcraft "superstitious", and ordering the death penalty for those who presume to burn witches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medspains.stanford.edu/demo/themes/adoptionism/frankfurt.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

There were also secular laws against witchcraft, such as that promulgated by King [[Athelstan]] (924-999)
:''And we have ordained respecting witch-crafts, and ''lybacs'' ''[read ''lyblac'' "sorcery"]'', and ''morthdaeds ["murder, mortal sin"]'': if any one should be thereby killed, and he could not deny it, that he be liable in his life. But if he will deny it, and at threefold ordeal shall be guilty; that he be 120 days in prison: and after that let kindred take him out, and give to the king 120 shillings, and pay the [[weregild|wer]] to his kindred, and enter into borh for him, that he evermore desist from the like.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/560-975dooms.html Medieval Sourcebook: The Anglo-Saxon Dooms, 560-975&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Witch-hunts sponsored by the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Inquisition]] begin only in the [[Late Middle Ages]]. Although it has been proposed that the witch-hunt developed in Europe from the early 14th century, after the [[Cathar]]s and the [[Templar Knights]] were exterminated, and the Inquisition had to turn to persecution of witches to remain active, this hypothesis has been rejected independently by two historians (Cohn 1975; Kieckhefer 1976). They showed that the Inquisition witch hunts originated among common people in [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Switzerland]] and in [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Croatia]], who pressed the [[civil courts]] to support them. [[Pope John XXII]] had authorized the Inquisition to prosecute sorcerors in 1320,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeffrey Burton Russell]], A History of Medieval Christianity (173).&lt;/ref&gt; but inquisitorial courts became systematically involved in witch-hunts only in the 15th century. In the case of the [[Madonna Oriente]], the Inquisition of [[Milan]] was not sure what to do with two women who in 1384 and in 1390 confessed to have participated in a type of [[white magic]]. In 1484 Pope Innocent VIII issued ''[[Summis desiderantes affectibus]]'', a [[Papal bull]] authorizing two inquisitors, Kramer and Sprenger, to systemize the persecution of witches.&lt;ref&gt;Levack, The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe, (49).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the notorious ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' was published in 1487, at the very end of the medieval period, ushering in the period of [[witch hunts in Early Modern Europe]] which would last for the following two centuries.

=== Early Modern Europe ===

[[File:Wickiana5.jpg|thumb|220px|Burning of three witches in [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]], Switzerland (1585), by [[Johann Jakob Wick]].]]

The witch trials in [[Early Modern Europe]] came in waves and then subsided. There were trials in the 15th and early 16th centuries, but then the witch scare went into decline, before becoming a big issue again and peaking in the 17th century. Some scholars argue that a fear of witchcraft started among intellectuals who believed in ''maleficium'': that is, harm committed by magic. What had previously been a belief that some people possessed supernatural abilities (which were sometimes used to protect the people) now became a sign of a pact between the people with supernatural abilities and the devil. To justify the killings, Christianity and its proxy secular institutions deemed witchcraft as being associated to wild [[Satanism|Satanic]] ritual parties in which there was much naked dancing, [[orgy|orgy sex]], and [[cannibalistic infanticide]].&lt;ref&gt;The Dark Side of Christian History by Helen Ellerbe.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also seen as [[heresy]] for going against the first of the [[ten commandments]] (You shall have no other gods before me) or as [[Lèse majesté|violating majesty]], in this case referring to the divine majesty, not the worldly.&lt;ref&gt;Meewis, Wim (1992) De Vierschaar, Uitgevering Pelckmans, pag 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Witch-hunts were seen across early modern Europe, but the most significant area of witch-hunting in modern Europe is often considered to be central and southern Germany.&lt;ref&gt;H. C. Erik Midelfort, “[http://www.historytoday.com/MainArticle.aspx?m=12341&amp;amid=12341 Heartland of the Witchcraze: Central and Northern Europe,”] ''History Today'' 31 (February 1981): 27-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Germany was a late starter in terms of the numbers of trials, compared to other regions of Europe. Witch-hunts first appeared in large numbers in southern France and Switzerland during the 14th and 15th centuries. The peak years of witch-hunts in southwest Germany were from 1561 to 1670.&lt;ref&gt;H.C. [[Erik Midelfort]], Witch Hunting in Southwestern Germany 1562-1684,1972,71&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wiesensteig witch trial|first major persecution]] in Europe, when witches were caught, tried, convicted, and burned in the imperial lordship of Wiesensteig in southwestern Germany, is recorded in 1563 in a pamphlet called "True and Horrifying Deeds of 63 Witches".&lt;ref&gt;Behringer (2004), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In [[Denmark]], the burning of witches increased following the [[Protestant Reformation|reformation]] of 1536. [[Christian IV of Denmark]], in particular, encouraged this practice, and hundreds of people were convicted of [[witchcraft]] and burnt. In England, the [[Witchcraft Act]] of 1542 regulated the penalties for witchcraft. In the [[North Berwick witch trials]] in [[Scotland]], over 70 people were accused of witchcraft on account of bad weather when [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland]], who shared the Danish king's interest in witch trials, sailed to Denmark in 1590 to meet his betrothed [[Anne of Denmark]].

Witch hysteria also erupted in the [[Americas]]. About eighty people throughout England's [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Colony]] were accused of practicing witchcraft, thirteen women and two men were executed in a witch-hunt that lasted throughout [[New England]] from 1648-1663.&lt;ref name=Fraden&gt;Fraden, Judith Bloom, Dennis Brindell Fraden. ''The Salem Witch Trials''. Marshall Cavendish. 2008. Pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Salem witch trials]] followed in 1692-93. 

Current scholarly estimates of the number of people executed for witchcraft vary between about 40,000 and 100,000.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The total number of witch trials in Europe which are known for certain to have ended in executions is around 12,000.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title = Estimates of executions |url=http://www.summerlands.com/crossroads/remembrance/current.htm }} Based on [[Ronald Hutton]]'s essay ''Counting the Witch Hunt''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary critics of witch hunts included [[Friedrich von Spee]], Gianfrancesco Ponzinibio, [[Cornelius Loos]], [[Reginald Scot]], [[Anton Praetorius]], Johann Mayfurth and Alonzo Salazar de Frias.

===End of European witch hunts in the 18th century===
In England, Scotland and Ireland, between 1542 and 1735 a series of [[Witchcraft Acts]] enshrined into law the punishment (often with [[Capital punishment|death]], sometimes with [[incarceration]]) of individuals practising, or claiming to practice witchcraft and magic.&lt;ref name = Gibson&gt;{{cite book |first=M |last=Gibson |contribution=Witchcraft in the Courts |pages=[http://books.google.ca/books?id=fyI9xo1GvGAC&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 1–18] |editor-first=Marion |editor-last=Gibson |title=Witchcraft And Society in England And America, 1550–1750 |year=2006 |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]] |isbn=978-0-8264-8300-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last executions for witchcraft in England had taken place in 1682, when Temperance Lloyd, Mary Trembles, and Susanna Edwards were executed at Exeter. [[Jane Wenham]] was among the last subjects of a typical witch trial in England in 1712, but was pardoned after her conviction and set free. [[Janet Horne]] was executed for witchcraft in Scotland in 1727. In 1711, [[Joseph Addison]] published an article in the highly respected ''[[The Spectator]]'' journal (No. 117) criticizing the irrationality and social injustice in treating elderly and feeble women (dubbed Moll White) as witches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 0766145360 | last = Summers | first = M | title = Geography of Witchcraft | pages = [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uV_kQksWgCoC&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 153-60] | year = 2003 | publisher = Kessinger Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt; The final Act of 1735 led to persecution for [[fraud]] rather than witchcraft since it was no longer believed that the individuals had actual supernatural powers or traffic with [[Satan]]. The 1735 Act continued to be used until the 1940s to prosecute individuals such as [[spiritualism|spiritualists]] and [[Names of the Romani people#Gypsy|Gypsies]]. The act was finally repealed in 1951.&lt;ref name = Gibson/&gt;

The last execution of a witch in the Dutch Republic was probably in 1613.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} {{cite news | url = http://archeonet.nl/index.php?itemid=5967 | title = Laatste executie van heks in Borculo| date = 2003-10-11 | accessdate = 2010-09-22 | publisher = Archeonnet.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Denmark this took place in 1693 with the execution of Anna Palles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.executedtoday.com/2010/04/04/1693-anne-palles-last-witch-executed-in-denmark/ | title = Last witch executed in Denmark | date = 2010-04-04 | accessdate = 2010-09-22 | publisher = www.executedtoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other parts of Europe, the practice died down later. In France the last person to be executed for witch craft was Louis Debaraz in 1745.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orionbooks.co.uk/reading-room/reading-guides/the-last-witchfinder Timeline The Last Witchfinder]&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany the last death sentence was that of Anna Schwegelin in [[Kempten]] in 1775 (although not carried out).&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.historicum.net/themen/hexenforschung/lexikon/personen/art/Schwaegelin_Ann/html/artikel/5602/ca/e96896a58d/ Anna Schwaegelin at Historicum.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern witch-hunts ==
Witch hunts still occur today in societies where belief in [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] is predominant. In most cases, these are instances of [[Lynching|mob justice]], reported with some regularity from much of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], from rural [[North India]] and from [[Papua New Guinea]]. In addition, there are some countries that have legislation against the practice of sorcery. The only country where witchcraft remains legally punishable by [[death penalty|death]] is [[Saudi Arabia]].

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
In many societies of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the fear of witches drives periodic witch-hunts during which specialist witch-finders identify suspects, with death by mob often the result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?14+Duke+J.+Comp.+&amp;+Int%27l+L.+351#H2N1 Mohammed A.

Witch-hunts against children were reported by the BBC in 1999 in the Congo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Congo witch-hunt's child victims |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/575178.stm |date=1999-12-22 |accessdate=2007-04-16 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Tanzania, where the government responded to attacks on women accused of being witches for having red eyes.&lt;ref name="tanzania-arrests-witch-killers"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tanzania arrests 'witch killers' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3209047.stm |date=2003-10-23 |accessdate=2007-04-16 |work=BBC News |quote=It is believed that any aged, old woman with red eyes is a witch}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lawsuit was launched in 2001 in Ghana, where witch-hunts are also common, by a woman accused of being a witch.&lt;ref name="tanzania-arrests-witch-killers"/&gt; Witch-hunts in Africa are often led by relatives seeking the property of the accused victim.

[[Audrey I. Richards]], in the journal ''Africa'', relates in 1935 an instance when a new wave of witchfinders, the ''Bamucapi'', appeared in the villages of the [[Bemba people]] of Zambia.&lt;ref&gt;''A Modern Movement of Witch Finders'' Audrey I Richards (Africa: Journal of the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures, Ed. Diedrich Westermann.) Vol VIII, 1935, published by Oxford University Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt; They dressed in European clothing, and would summon the headman to prepare a ritual meal for the village. When the villagers arrived they would view them all in a [[mirror]], and claimed they could identify witches with this method. These witches would then have to "yield up his horns"; i.e. give over the [[horn (anatomy)|horn]] containers for [[curse]]s and evil [[potion]]s to the witch-finders. The bamucapi then made all drink a potion called ''kucapa'' which would cause a witch to die and swell up if he ever tried such things again. The villagers related that the witch-finders were always right because the witches they found were always the people whom the village had feared all along. The bamucapi utilised a mixture of Christian and native religious traditions to account for their powers and said that God (not specifying which God) helped them to prepare their medicine. In addition, all witches who did not attend the meal to be identified would be called to account later on by their master, who had risen from the dead, and who would force the witches by means of drums to go to the graveyard, where they would die. Richards noted that the bamucapi created the sense of danger in the villages by rounding up ''all'' the horns in the village, whether they were used for anti-witchcraft charms, potions, snuff or were indeed receptacles of black magic. 

The Bemba people believed misfortunes such as [[warting]]s [[haunting]]s and [[famine]]s to be just actions sanctioned by the High-God Lesa. The only agency which caused unjust harm was a witch, who had enormous powers and was hard to detect. After white rule of Africa beliefs in sorcery and witchcraft grew, possibly because of the social strain caused by new ideas, customs and laws, and also because the courts no longer allowed witches to be tried.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Amongst the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] tribes of [[Southern Africa]], the [[witch smeller]]s were responsible for detecting witches. In parts of Southern Africa several hundred people have been killed in witch hunts since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hayesfam.bravehost.com/WITCH1.HTM Christian responses to witchcraft and sorcery]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several African states,&lt;ref&gt;"Whereas witchcraft cases in the colonial era, especially in former British Central Africa, were based on the official dogma that witchcraft is an illusion (so that people invoking witchcraft would be punished as either impostors or slanderers), in contemporary legal practice in Africa witchcraft appears as a reality and as an actionable offence in its own right." Wim van Binsbergen, ''[http://www.shikanda.net/african_religion/witchtxt.htm Witchcraft in Modern Africa]'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Cameroon]]&lt;ref&gt;section 251 of the Cameroonian penal code (26 Aug. 2004). Two other provisions of the penal code [translation] "state that witchcraft may be an aggravating factor for dishonest acts" (Afrik.com 26 Aug. 2004). A person convicted of witchcraft may face a prison term of 2 to 10 years and a fine.

It was reported on 21 May 2008 that in [[Kenya]] a mob had burnt to death at least 11 people accused of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL21301127 Mob burns to death 11 Kenyan "witches"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009 Amnesty International reported that up to 1,000 people in [[the Gambia]] had been abducted by government-sponsored "witch doctors" on charges of witchcraft, and taken to detention centers where they were forced to drink poisonous concoctions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/gambia-hundreds-accused-%E2%80%9Cwitchcraft%E2%80%9D-and-poisoned-government-campaign-20 "The Gambia: Hundreds accused of "witchcraft" and poisoned in government campaign"]&lt;/ref&gt; On May 21, 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the alleged witch-hunting campaign had been sparked by the Gambia's President [[Yahya Jammeh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/world/africa/21gambia.html?ref=africa "Witch-Hunt in Gambia"]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Sierra Leone]], the witch-hunt is an occasion for a sermon by the ''kɛmamɔi'' (native [[Mende]] witch-finder) on social ethics : "Witchcraft ... takes hold in people’s lives when people are less than fully open-hearted. All wickedness is ultimately because people hate each other or are jealous or suspicious or afraid. These emotions and motivations cause people to act antisocially".&lt;ref&gt;''STUDIA INSTITUTI ANTHROPOS'', Vol. 41 = Anthony J. Gittins : ''Mende Religion''. Steyler Verlag, Nettetal, 1987. p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; The response by the populace to the ''kɛmamɔi'' is that "they valued his work and would learn the lessons he came to teach them, about social responsibility and cooperation."&lt;ref&gt;''STUDIA INSTITUTI ANTHROPOS'', Vol. 41 = Anthony J. Gittins : ''Mende Religion''. Steyler Verlag, Nettetal, 1987. p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
In [[India]], labeling a woman as a witch is a common ploy to grab land, settle scores or even to punish her for turning down sexual advances. In a majority of the cases, it is difficult for the accused woman to reach out for help and she is forced to either abandon her home and family or driven to commit suicide. Most cases are not documented because it's difficult for poor and illiterate women to travel from isolated regions to file police reports. Less than 2 percent of those accused of witch-hunting are actually convicted, according to a study by the Free Legal Aid Committee, a group that works with victims in the state of Jharkhand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.womensenews.org/story/the-world/070716/recourse-rare-witch-hunt-victims-in-india&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Papua New Guinea ===
Though the practice of "white" magic (such as [[faith healing]]) is legal in Papua, the 1976 Sorcery Act imposes a penalty of up to 2 years in prison for the practise of [[black magic|"black" magic]]. In 2009, the government reports that extrajudicial torture and murder of alleged witches - usually lone women - is spreading from the Highland areas to cities as villagers migrate to urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.channel4.com/programmes/unreported-world/episode-guide/series-2009/episode-9&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Saudi Arabia ===
A Saudi woman, [[Fawza Falih]], was arrested by the Saudi religious police in 2005. 
The illiterate woman allegedly beaten and forced to fingerprint a confession that had not been read out to her. As of February 2008, the woman was convicted of using sorcery to render a man impotent, and was sentenced to death, facing execution by beheading.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article3378460.ece King Abdullah urged to spare Saudi ‘witchcraft’ woman’s life], 16 Februar 2008.

On November 9, 2009, [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] TV presenter [[Ali Hussain Sibat|Ali Sibat]] (who was arrested in [[Medina]] in 2008) was sentenced to death on charges of witchcraft. According to Sarah Leah Whitson, the Middle East director at [[Human Rights Watch]], "Saudi courts are sanctioning a literal witch hunt by the religious police." Also according to Human Rights Watch, two other people have been arrested on similar charges in November 2009 alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.news.yahoo.com/5/20091124/tod-tv-presenter-on-death-row-for-witchc-870a197.html TV Presenter On Death Row For Witchcraft] - Sky News, November 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthropological causes==
The wide distribution of the practice of witch-hunts in geographically and culturally separated societies (Europe, Africa, India, New Guinea) since the 1960s has triggered interest in the [[anthropological]] background of this behaviour. The belief in [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[divination]], and attempts to use magic to influence personal well-being (to increase life, win love, etc.) are human [[cultural universal]]s. 

Belief in witchcraft has been shown to have similarities in societies throughout the world. It presents a framework to explain the occurrence of otherwise random misfortunes such as sickness or death, and thethe witch sorcerer provides an image of [[evil]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean Sybil La Fontaine, ''Speak of the devil: tales of satanic abuse in contemporary England'', Cambridge University Press, 1998, ISBN 9780521629348 34-37.&lt;/ref&gt; Reports on indigenous practices in the Americas, Asia and Africa collected during the early modern [[age of exploration]] have indeed been taken to suggest that not just the belief in witchcraft but also the periodic outbreak of witch-hunts are a human cultural universal.&lt;ref&gt;Behringer (2004), 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphorical usage==
{{see|moral panic}}
[[File:Is this tomorrow.jpg|thumb|225px|A 1947 propaganda comic book published by the Catechetical Guild Educational Society warning of the dangers of a Communist takeover.]] 
In modern terminology 'witch-hunt' has acquired usage referring to the act of seeking and persecuting any perceived enemy, particularly when the search is conducted using extreme measures and with little regard to actual guilt or innocence. It is used whether or not it is sanctioned by the government, or merely occurs within the "court of public opinion". 

The first such use reported by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' dates to 1932.&lt;ref&gt;
J. F. Carter, ''What we are about to Receive'' (xviii. 204): "Once the election is over [...] we shall quietly lay aside our witch hunting."&lt;/ref&gt; Another early instance is [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938). The term is used by Orwell to describe how, in the [[Spanish Civil War]], political persecutions became a regular occurrence.

The term is used when a hunt for wrongdoers becomes abused, and a defendant can be convicted merely on an accusation. For example, in the [[History Channel]] documentary [[America: The Story of Us]], narrator [[Liev Schreiber]] explains that "the search for runaway [[slaves]] becomes a witch hunt. A black man can be convicted with merely an accusation. Unlike white people, they do not have the right to trial by jury. Judges are paid ten dollars to rule them as slaves, five to set them free."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = Liev Schreiber | title = America: The Story of Us - Division | medium = Television | publisher = Nutopia | date = May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the term was popularized in the United States in the context of the [[McCarthyism|McCarthyist]] search for communists during the [[Cold War]],&lt;ref name="JensenPath"&gt;{{cite book |first=Gary F. |last=Jensen |title=The Path of the Devil |pages=Ch. 8 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2007 |isbn=0742546977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MurphyCongress"&gt;{{cite book |last=Murphy |first=Brenda |title=Congressional Theatre |pages=Ch. 4 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1999 |isbn=0521891663}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was discredited partly through being compared to the [[Salem witch trials]].&lt;ref name="JensenPath"/&gt; 

From the 1960s, the term was in wide use and could also be applied to isolated incidents or scandals, specifically public smear-campaigns against individuals. The [[McMartin preschool trial]] of 1984 to 1990 is another iconic example of a moral panic which saw day care providers accused of what was dubbed "[[satanic ritual abuse]]", i.e. the charge of [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual child abuse]] out of an alleged [[Satanism|Satanist]] motivation. The case and the associated media coverage was frequently termed a witch-hunt by commentators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = de Young | first = Mary | title = The Day Care Ritual Abuse Moral Panic | authorlink = Mary de Young | url = http://books.google.com/?id=_e8ZkJBtz0EC | year = 2004 | publisher = McFarland and Company | location = Jefferson, North Carolina, United States | isbn = 0786418303 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
