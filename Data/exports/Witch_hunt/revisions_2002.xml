=== Early Church ===
Probably the attitude of the early [[Church]] was not a little influenced by the criminal legislation of the [[Roman Empire]] as well as by Jewish feeling. The law of the [[Twelve Tables]] already assumes the reality of magical powers, and the terms of the frequent references in [[Horace]] to [[Canidia]] allow us to see the odium in which such sorceresses were held. Under the Empire, in the third century, the punishment of burning alive was enacted by the State against [[witch]]es who compassed another person's death through their [[enchantment]]s. The ecclesiastical legislation followed a similar but milder course. 

The [[Council of Elvira]] ([[306]]), Canon 6, refused the holy [[Viaticum]] to those who had killed a man ''per maleficium'' (by a spell) and adds the reason that such a [[crime]] could not be effected "without ''idolatry''"; which probably mens without the aid of the [[Devil]], devil-worship and idolatry being then convertible terms. Similarly canon 24 of the [[Council of Ancyra]] ([[314]]) imposes five years of [[penance]] upon those who consult [[magic (paranormal)|magician]]s, and here again the offence is treated as being a practical participation in [[paganism]]. This legislation represented the mind of the Church for many centuries. Similar penalties were enacted at the Eastern [[council in Trullo]] ([[692]]), while certain early Irish canons in the far West treated [[sorcery]] as a [[crime]] to be visited with [[excommunication]] until adequate [[penance]] had been performed. 

None the less the general desire of the clergy to check fanaticism is well illustrated by such a council as that of [[Paderborn]] ([[785]]). Although it enacts that sorcerers are to be reduced to serfdom and made over to the service of the Church, a decree was also passed in the following terms: "''Whosoever, blinded by the devil and infected with pagan errors, holds another person for a witch that eats human flesh, and therefore burns her, eats her flesh, or gives it to others to eat, shall be punished with death''". Altogether it may be said that in the first thirteen hundred years of the Christian era we find no trace of that fierce denunciation and persecution of supposed sorceresses which characterized the cruel witch hunts of a later age. In these earlier centuries a few individual prosecutions for [[witchcraft]] took place, and in some of these [[torture]] (permitted by the Roman civil law) apparently took place. [[Pope Nicholas I]], indeed (A.D. [[866]]), prohibited the use of torture, and a similar decree may be found in the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals. In spite of this it was not everywhere given up. Also we must notice that a good many suspected [[witch]]es were subjected to the ordeal of cold water, but as the sinking of the victim was regarded as a proof of her [[innocence]], we may reasonably believe that the [[verdict]]s so arrived at were generally verdicts of [[acquittal]]. On many different occasions ecclesiastics who spoke with authority did their best to disabuse the people of their belief in [[witchcraft]]. This for instance is the general purport of the book, "''Contra insulsam vulgi opinionem de grandine et tonitruis''" (Against the foolish belief of the common sort concerning hail and thunder), written by [[Saint Agobard]] (d. [[841]]), Archbishop of [[Lyons]] (''P.L.,'' CIV, 147). Still more to the point is the section of the work, "''De ecclesiasticis disciplinis''" ascribed to [[Regino of Pr√ºm]] (A.D. [[906]]). In section 364 we read: This also is not to be passed over that "certain abandoned women, turning aside to follow [[Satan]], being seduced by the illusions and phantasms of [[demon]]s, believe and openly profess that in the dead of night they ride upon certain beasts along with the pagan goddess [[Diana]] and a countless horde of women and that in these silent hours they fly over vast tracts of country and obey her as their mistress, while on other nights they are summoned to pay her homage." And then he goes on to remark that if it were only the women themselves were deluded it would be a matter of little consequence, but unfortunately an ''innumera multitudo'' (immense number of people) believe these things to be true and believing them depart from the true [[Faith]], so that practically speaking they fall into [[Paganism]]. And in this account he says "it is the duty of [[priest]]s earnestly to instruct the people that these things are absolutely untrue and that such imaginings are planted in the minds of misbelieving folk, not by a Divine spirit, but by the spirit of [[evil]]". It would be far too sweeping a conclusion to infer that the [[Carlovingian]] Church by this utterance proclaimed its disbelief in [[witchcraft]], but the passage at least proves that in regard to such matters a saner and more critical spirit had begun to prevail among the [[clergy]]. 

=== Middle Ages ===
The "Decretum" of [[Burchard]], Bishop of [[Worms]] (about [[1020]]), and especially its 19th book, often known separately as the "Corrector", is another work of great importance. Burchard, or the teachers from whom he has compiled his treatise, still believes in some forms of [[witchcraft]] - in magical [[potion]]s, for instance, which may produce [[impotence]] or [[abortion]]. But he altogether rejects the possibility of many of the marvellous powers with which [[witch]]es were popularly credited. Such, for example, were the nocturnal riding through the air, the changing of a person's disposition from [[love]] to [[hate]], the control of [[thunder]], [[rain]], and [[sunshine]], the transformation of a man into an [[animal]], the intercourse of [[incubi]] and [[succubi]] with human beings. Not only the attempt to practise such things but the very belief in their possibility is treated by him as a [[sin]] for which the confessor must require his penitent to do a serious assigned [[penance]]. [[Gregory VII]] in [[1080]] wrote to King [[Harold]] of [[Denmark]] forbidding [[witch]]es to be put to death upon presumption of their having caused [[storm]]s or failure of [[crop]]s or [[pestilence]]. Neither were these the only examples of an effort to stem the tide of unjust suspicion to which these poor creatures were exposed. 

On the other hand, after the middle of the [[13th century]], the then recently-constituted [[Papal Inquisition]] began to concern itself with charges of [[witchcraft]]. [[Alexander IV]], indeed, ruled ([[1258]]) that the inquisitors should limit their intervention to those cases in which there was some ''manifeste haeresim saparent'' (clear presumption of heretical belief), but heretical tendencies were very readily inferred from almost any sort of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]al practices. Neither is this altogether surprising when we remember how freely the [[Cathari]] parodied [[Catholic]] ritual in their ''consolamentum'' and other rites, and how easily the [[Manichaean dualism]] of their system might be interpreted as a homage to the powers of darkness. It was at any rate at [[Toulouse]], the hot-bed of Catharan infection, that we meet in [[1275]] the earliest example of a [[witch]] burned to death after judicial sentence of an inquisitor, who was in this case a certain Hugues de Baniol. The woman, probably half crazy, "confessed" to having brought forth a [[monster]] after intercourse with an evil [[spirit]] and to having nourished it with babies' flesh which she procured in her nocturnal expeditions. The possibility of such [[sexual intercourse]] between human beings and [[demon]]s was unfortunately accepted by some of the great schoolmen, even, for example, by [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] and [[St. Bonaventure]]. 

Nevertheless within the [[Church]] itself there was always a strong common-sense reaction against this theorizing, a reaction which more especially manifested itself in the confession manuals of the close of the [[15th century]]. These were largely compiled by men who were in actual contact with the people, and who realized the harm effected by the extravagance of these superstitious beliefs. Stephen Lanzkranna, for instance, treated the belief in women who rode about at night, hobgoblins, were-wolves, and "other such heathen nonsensical impostures", as one of the greatest of [[sin]]s. Moreover this common-sense influence was a powerful one. Speaking of the synods held in Bavaria, so unfriendly a witness as Riezler (Hexenprozesse in Bayern, p. 32) declares that "among the official representatives of the Church this healthier tendency remained the prevalent one down to the threshold of the witch-trial epidemic, that is until far on in the [[16th century]]". Even as late as the [[Salzburg]] Provincial Synod of [[1569]], we find indication of a strong tendency to prevent as far as possible the imposition of the [[death penalty]] in cases of reputed 
[[witchcraft]], by insisting that these things were diabolical illusions. Still there can be no doubt that during the [[14th century]] certain papal constitutions of [[John XXII]] and [[Benedict XII]] did very much to stimulate the prosecution by the inquisitors of [[witch]]es and others engaged in [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]al practices, especially in the south of [[France]]. In a witch trial on a large scale carried on at [[Toulouse]] in [[1334]], out of sixty-three persons accused of offences of this kind, eight were handed over to the secular arm to be burned and the rest were imprisoned either for life or for a long term of years. Two of the condemned, both elderly women, after repeated application of [[torture]], confessed that they had assisted at witches' sabbaths, had there worshipped the [[Devil]], had been guilty of indecencies with him and with the other persons present, and had eaten the flesh of infants whom they had carried off by night from their nurses. In [[1324]] Petronilla de Midia was burnt at [[Kilkenny]] in Ireland at the instance of Richard, Bishop of [[Ossory]]; but analogous cases in the British Isles seem to have been very rare. During this period the secular courts proceeded against [[witchcraft]] with equal or even greater severity than the ecclesiastical tribunals, and here also [[torture]] was employed and burning at the stake. Fire was the punishment juridically appointed for this offence in the secular codes known as the "Sachsenspiegel" ([[1225]]) and the "Schwabenspiegel" ([[1275]]). Indeed during the 13th and 14th centuries no prosecutions for witchcraft are known to have been undertaken in Germany by the papal inquisitors. About the year 1400 we find wholesale witch-prosecutions being carried out at [[Bern]] in [[Switzerland]] by [[Peter de Gruy√®res]], who was unquestionably a secular judge, and other campaigns - for example in the [[Valais]] ([[1428]]-[[1434]]) when 200 witches were put to death, or at [[Briancon]] in [[1437]] when over 150 suffered, some of them by drowning - were carried on by the secular courts. The victims of the inquisitors, e.g. at [[Heidelberg]] in [[1447]]; or in [[Savoy]] in 1462, do not seem to have been quite so numerous. In [[France]] at this period the crime of witchcraft was frequently designated as "Vauderie" through some confusion seemingly with the followers of the heretic, [[Peter Waldes]]. But this confusion between [[sorcery]] and a particular form of [[heresy]] was unfortunately bound to bring a still larger number of persons under the jealous scrutiny of the inquisitors. 

It will be readily understood from the foregoing that the importance attached by many older writers to the Bull, ''Summis desiderantes affectibus'', of [[Pope Innocent VIII]] ([[1484]]), as though this papal document were responsible for the witch mania of the two succeeding centuries, is altogether illusory. Not only had an active campaign against most forms of [[sorcery]] already been going on for a long period, but in the matter of procedure, of punishments, of judges, etc., Innocent's Bull enacted nothing new. Its direct purport was simply to ratify the powers already conferred upon Henry Institoris and James Sprenger, inquisitors, to deal with persons of every class and with every form of crime (for example, with [[witchcraft]] as well as [[heresy]]), and it called upon the Bishop of [[Strasburg]] to lend the inquisitors all possible support. 

Indirectly, however, by specifying the evil practices charged against the [[witch]]es - for example their intercourse with [[incubi]] and [[succubi]], their interference with the parturition of women and animals, the damage they did to [[cattle]] and the fruits of the earth, their power and malice in the infliction of [[pain]] and [[disease]], the hindrance caused to men in their conjugal relations, and the witches' repudiation of the faith of their [[baptism]] - the pope must no doubt be considered to affirm the reality of these alleged phenomena. But "it is perfectly obvious that the Bull pronounces no dogmatic decision"; neither does the form suggest that the pope wishes to bind anyone to believe more about the reality of [[witchcraft]] than is involved in the utterances of Holy Scripture. Probably the most disastrous episode was the publication a year or two later, by the same inquisitors, of the book "''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]''" (the hammer of witches). This work is divided into three parts, the first two of which deal with the reality of witchcraft as established by the [[Bible]], etc., as well as its nature and horrors and the manner of dealing with it, while the third lays down practical rules for procedure whether the [[trial]] be conducted in an ecclesiastical or a secular [[court]]. There can be no doubt that the book, owing to its reproduction by the [[printing press]], exercised great influence. It contained, indeed, nothing that was new. 

The "Formicaris" of John Nider, which had been written nearly fifty years earlier, exhibits just as intimate a knowledge of the supposed phenomena of sorcery. But the "Malleus" professed (in part fraudulently) to have been approved by the University of [[Cologne]], and it was sensational in the stigma it attached to witchcraft as a worse crime than [[heresy]] and in its notable animus against the female sex. The subject at once began to attract attention even in the world of letters. Ulrich Molitoris a year or two later published a work, "De Lamiis", which, though disagreeing with the more extravagant of the representations made in the "Malleus", did not question the existence of witches. Other divines and popular preachers joined in the discussion, and, though many voices were raised on the side of common sense, the publicity thus given to these matters inflamed the popular imagination. Certainly the immediate effects of Innocent VIII's Bull have been greatly exaggerated. Institoris started a witch campaign at [[Innsbruck]] in [[1485]], but here his procedure was severely criticised and resisted by the Bishop of [[Brixen]]. So far as the papal inquisitors were concerned, the Bull, especially in [[Germany]], heralded the close rather than the commencement of their activity. The witch-trials of the 16th and 17th centuries were for the most part in secular hands. 

=== The Reformation ===

One fact which is absolutely certain is that, so far as [[Luther]], [[Calvin]], and their followers were concerned, the popular belief in the power of the [[Devil]] as exercised through [[witchcraft]] and other magic practices was developed beyond all measure. Naturally Luther did not appeal to the papal Bull. He looked only to the [[Bible]], and it was in virtue of the Biblical command that he advocated the extermination of [[witch]]es. But no portion of Janssen's ''History'' is more unanswerable than the fourth and fifth chapters of the last volume (vol. XVI of the English edition) in which he attributes a large, if not the greater, share of the responsibility for the witch mania to the Reformers. 

The penal code known as the Carolina ([[1532]]) decreed that sorcery throughout the German empire should be treated as a criminal offence, and if it purported to inflict injury upon any person the witch was to be burnt at the stake. In [[1572]] Augustus of [[Saxony]] imposed the penalty of burning for witchcraft of every kind, including simple fortunetelling. On the whole, greater activity in hunting down witches was shown in the [[Protestant]] districts of [[Germany]] than in the [[Catholic]] provinces. In [[Osnabr√ºck]], in [[1583]], 121 persons were burned in three months. At [[Wolfenb√ºttel]] in [[1593]] as many as ten witches were often burned in one day. It was not until [[1563]] that any effective resistance to the persecution began to be offered. This came first from a Protestant of [[Cleues]], John Weyer, and other protests were shortly afterwards published in the same sense by Ewich and Witekind. On the other hand, Jean Bodin, a French Protestant lawyer, replied to Weyer in [[1580]] with much asperity, and in [[1589]] the [[Catholic]] Bishop Binsfeld and Father Delrio, a [[Jesuit]], wrote on the same side, though Delrio wished to mitigate the severity of the witch trials and denounced the excessive use of [[torture]]. Bodin's book was answered amongst others by the Englishman Reginald Scott in his ''Discoverie of Witchcraft'' ([[1584]]), but this answer was ordered to be burned by [[James I]], who replied to it in his ''Daemonologie.'' 

Perhaps the most effective protest on the side of humanity and enlightenment was offered by the [[Jesuit]] Friedrich von Spee, who in 1631 published his ''Cautio criminalis'' and who fought against the craze by every means in his power. This cruel [[persecution]] seems to have extended to all parts of the world. In the [[16th century]] there were cases in which witches were condemned by lay tribunals and burned in the immediate neighbourhood of [[Rome]]. 
[[Pope Gregory XV]], however, in his Constitution, "omnipotentis" ([[1623]]), recommended a milder procedure, and in [[1657]] an Instruction of the [[Inquisition]] brought effective remonstrances to bear upon the cruelty shown in these prosecutions. 

[[England]] and [[Scotland]], of course, were by no means exempt from the same epidemic of cruelty, though witches were not usually burned. As to the number of executions in [[Great Britain]] it seems impossible to form any safe estimate. One statement declares that 30,000, another that 3000, were hanged in England during the rule of the Parliament. Stearne the witchfinder boasted that he personally knew of 200 executions. Howell, writing in [[1648]], says that within the compass of two years near upon 300 witches were arraigned, and the major part executed, in [[Essex, England|Essex]] and [[Suffolk]] only. In Scotland there is the same lack of statistics. A careful article by Legge in the "Scottish Review" (Oct., [[1891]]) estimates that during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries "3400 persons perished". For a small population such as that of Scotland, this number is enormous, but many authorities, though confessedly only guessing, have given a much higher estimate. Even [[United States|America]] was not exempt from this plague. The well-known Cotton Mather, in his "Wonders of the Invisible World" ([[1693]]), gives an account of 19 executions of witches in [[New England]], where one poor creature was pressed to death. New England was the site of the [[Salem witch trials]] in [[1692]]. 

In modern times, considerable attention has been given to the subject by Hexham and others. At the end of the [[17th century]] the persecution almost everywhere began to slacken, and early in the 18th it practically ceased. Torture was abolished in [[Prussia]] in [[1754]], in [[Bavaria]] in 1807, in [[Hanover]] in [[1822]]. The last trial for witchcraft in Germany was in [[1749]] at [[W√ºrzburg]], but in [[Switzerland]] a girl was executed for this offence in the [[Protestant]] Canton of [[Glarus]] in [[1783]]. There seems to be no evidence to support the allegation sometimes made that women suspected of witchcraft were formally tried and put to death in [[Mexico]] late in the [[19th century]]. 

The question of the reality of [[witchcraft]] is one upon which it is not easy to pass a confident judgment. In the face of [[Holy Scripture]] and the teaching of the Fathers and theologians the abstract possibility of a pact with the [[Devil]] and of a diabolical interference in human affairs can hardly be denied, but no one can read the literature of the subject without realizing the awful cruelties to which this belief and without being convinced that in 99 cases out of 100 the allegations rest upon nothing better than pure delusion. The most bewildering circumstance is the fact that in a large number of witch prosecutions the confessions of the victims, often involving all kinds of satanistic horrors, have been made spontaneously and apparently without threat or fear of [[torture]]. Also the full admission of guilt seems constantly to have been confirmed on the scaffold when the poor suffered had nothing to gain or lose by the confession. One can only record the fact as a psychological problem, and point out that the same tendency seems to manifest itself in other similar cases. The most remarkable instance, perhaps, is one mentioned by [[St. Agobard]] in the [[9th century]]. A certain Grimaldus, Duke of Beneventum, was accused, in the panic engendered by a [[plague]] that was destroying all the [[cattle]], of sending men out with poisoned dust to spread [[infection]] among the flocks and herds. These men, when arrested and questioned, persisted, says Agobard, in affirming their guilt, though the absurdity was patent. 

:''From the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia''
=== Early Modern Europe ===
During an period of several centuries much of Europe and America believed that [[Satan]] was acting in concert with human servants, and there were extensive efforts to root out these supposed witches. These efforts included torture of the most horrific nature including hot pincers, the [[thumbscrew]], the [[iron maiden]], and a hundred methods equally frightful. Every region had its own methods, and individuals their specialties depending on its traditions of judicial questioning - of which torture was a usual component.

England at one point had a self-proclaimed "Witchfinder General", one [[Matthew Hopkins]],  who led searches, and who claimed to be able to identify a witch using techniques such as [[witches mark|witches' marks]]. Much of the public believed the victims were really witches, but today it is not believed that most of them were.   

Research into the laws and records of the time show that the witchfinders often used [[peine forte et dure]] and other [[torture]] to extract confessions and condemnations of friends, relatives and neighbors. Virtually everyone today looks on this period of history as a very dark time.

The measured employed against alleged witches were some of the worst ever practiced in the Western world. In ''A History of Torture'', George Ryley Scott says:

:The peculiar beliefs and superstitions attached to or associated with witchcraft caused those who were suspected of practising the craft to be extremely likely to be subjected to tortures of greater degree than any ordinary heretic or criminal. More, certain specific torments were invented for use against them.

The witchhunts were part of a larger culture which was very religiously and socially intolerant.

See also the [[Inquisition]].

=== Witch Hunters in African Societies ===
In many African societies the fear of witches drives periodic witchhunts during which specialist witch finders identify suspects.

=== Metaphorical Uses of the Term in the Modern West ===
Witchhunt in modern terminology refers to seeking out people opposed to a group either as a revenge mechanism or out of genuine fear or opposition, particularly when the search is conducted using extreme measures and with little regard to actual guilt or innocence. 

The term originated with [[Arthur Miller]]'s play, ''[[The Crucible]]'' which was ostensibly about the [[Salem witch trials]] but were intended to criticize the hearings of [[United States]] Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]. Other [[anti-communist]] hearings in the [[1950s]] were under the aegis of the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], or HUAC.  The term "witchhunt" is usually employed by the victims through the media.  Revelations of the Soviet archives in the [[1990s]] proved that the investigations were pursuing real quarry in addition to persecuting innocent victims.  McCarthy was completely ineffective in this role.  HUAC uncovered some genuine Communist infiltrators but was also compromised by wild accusations and disregard for civil liberties and civil discourse.</rev></revisions></page></pages></query></api>
