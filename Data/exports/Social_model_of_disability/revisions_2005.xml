But those people are disabled by the barriers that exist in a society that does not take account of their needs.  These barriers may be in the physical, organisational or personal aspects of society - for instance, stairs without lifts, information not available in large print, or people’s negative attitudes.  The social model sees disabled people as having the same wants, needs and aspirations to non-disabled people. Disabled people should enjoy the same freedoms and choices as those who are non-disabled and be allowed equal responsibilty in determining their life choices.  Disability is not seen as something invoking pity or in need of a cure.  Indeed it may be viewed as a positive asset.  Equality for disabled people is seen in the same light as equality for other under-represented groups.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Disability Discrimination Act]] definition of disability uses the medical model - disabled people are defined as people with certain conditions, or certain limitations on their ability to carry out ‘normal day-to-day activities’.  But the requirement on employers and service providers to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ to their policies or practices, or physical aspects of their premises, follows the social model.  By making adjustments, employers and service providers are removing the barriers that disable - they are effectively removing the disability.

In the [[United States]], the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] is a wide-ranging [[civil rights]] law that prohibits discrimination based on disability. It affords similar protections against discrimination to Americans with disabilities as the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which made discrimination based on race, religion, sex, national origin, and other characteristics illegal. Certain specific conditions are excluded, including alcoholism and transsexuality.
