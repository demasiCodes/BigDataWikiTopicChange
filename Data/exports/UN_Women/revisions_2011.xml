The '''United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women''', also known as '''UN Women''', is a [[United Nations]] entity working for the [[empowerment]] of women and girls.

UN Women became operational in January 2011.&lt;ref name="un"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/faq/ |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=UN Women |date=2010-09-14 |accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[president of Chile]] [[Michelle Bachelet]] is the inaugural Executive Director. As with [[UNIFEM]] previously, UN Women is a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 UNDG Members&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In response to the UN General Assembly resolution 63/311, in January 2006 the Secretary-General presented the report A/64/588, entitled “Comprehensive Proposal for the Composite Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women.” In his report, the Secretary-General resolved that, rather than relieving other parts of the United Nations system of their responsibility for contributing to the promotion of gender equality and women’s empowerment, the new entity should seek to sharpen the focus and impact of the gender equality activities of the entire United Nations system. Additionally, Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] estimated that approximately $125 million per annum were needed for operating costs and “start-up” capacity at the country, regional, and headquarters levels. Moreover, an additional $375 million per annum were needed in the initial phase to respond to country level requests for programmatic support. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/64/588 |title=Report on the Secretary General: Comprehensive proposal for the composite entity for gender equality and the empowerment of women |publisher=United Nations |date=2010-01-06|accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of negotiations between UN Member States, women’s groups and civil society, on 2 July 2010 the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted resolution 64/289, thus creating UN Women by merging the Division for the Advancement of Women (DAW); the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW, established in 1976); the Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues Advancement of Women (OSAGI, established in 1997), and the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM, established in 1976). Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced at the founding of the movement that he is "grateful to Member States for having taken this major step forward for the world’s women and girls. UN Women will significantly boost UN efforts to promote gender equality, expand opportunity, and tackle discrimination around the globe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/ |title=Welcome to UN Women  UN Women |publisher=Unwomen.org |date=2010-07-02 |accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 14, 2010, it was announced that former [[President of Chile]] [[Michelle Bachelet]] was appointed as head of UN Women.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=52834 "Michelle Bachelet's Appointment to Head UN Women Widely Applauded"], ''[[Inter Press Service]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Various countries supported the creation of the body and welcomes Bachelet as chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/ga/65/meetings/generaldebate/View/Sept24.aspx |title=General Debate: 65th Session |publisher=Gadebate.un.org |date=2010-09-29 |accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; During General Debate at the opening of the 65th General Assembly of the United Nations, world leaders commended the creation of the body and its intention to "empower women,"  as well as welcoming Bachelet's position as the inaugural head.&lt;ref&gt;The various speeches from all the world leader from 23-25 &amp; 27-30 September 2010 are listed at http://gadebate.un.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The provisions set forth by resolution 63/311 on system-wide coherence, adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 2 October, 2010, constituted the blueprint for UN Women. Seeking to strengthen the United Nation’s institutional arrangements for gender equality and women empowerment, resolution 63/311 supported the consolidation of four distinct parts of the UN system that focused exclusively on gender equality and women’s empowerment into a composite entity to be led by an Under-Secretary-General. Moreover, the resolution requested that the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] produce a proposal specifying the mission statement of the composite entity and its organizational arrangements, including an organizational chart, funding and the executive board to oversee its operational activities. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/63/311|title=Resolution on 6/311 on system-wide coherence |publisher=United Nations General Assembly |date=2010-11-09|accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and functioning==
Resolution 64/289 determined that the entity should be headed by an Under-Secretary-General, to be appointed by the Secretary-General in consultation with Member States, for a term of four years, with the possibility of renewal for one term.

The organization is governed by a multi-tiered intergovernmental governance structure in charge of providing normative and operational policy guidance. The General Assembly, [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]], and the [[Commission on the Status of Women]] (CSW) constitute the governance structure that sets forth the normative policy guiding principles of the Entity. The intergovernmental governance structure in charge of providing operational policy guidance to UN Women includes the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and the organization’s Executive Board. The latter consist of forty-one members, elected by the Economic and Social Council for a term of three years and distributed as follows: 

* Ten from the Group of African States

* Ten from the Group of Asian States

* Four from the Group of Eastern European States

* Six from the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States

* Five from the Group of Western European and Other States

* Six from contributing countries. Four seats will be selected by and from the top ten largest providers of voluntary core contributions to UN Women. The remaining two seats will be allocated to two developing countries not members of the [[Development Assistance Committee]] of the [[Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (DAC/OECD). These two countries will be selected by the developing countries not members of the Development Assistance Committee among the top ten providers of voluntary core contributions to the entity.

The resources required to fund all normative processes are obtained from the Entity’s regular budget and approved by the General Assembly, whereas the budget fot service operational processes and activities at all levels are funded from voluntary contributions and approved by the Executive Board of UN Women.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/64/289 |title=Resolution on 64/289 on system-wide coherence. |publisher=United Nations General Assembly |date=22010-07-21|accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
