The '''United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women''', also known as '''UN Women''', is a [[United Nations]] entity charged with working for [[gender equality]] and the [[Women's empowerment|empowerment of women]]. UN Women is charged with advocating for the rights of women and girls, and focusing on an array of issues, including [[violence against women]] and [[violence against LGBT people]].

UN Women was established by the merger of the [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM, established in 1976) and other entities, and became operational in 2011.&lt;ref name="un"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiapacific.unwomen.org/en/countries/fiji/faq|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=UN Women - Asia and the Pacific|access-date=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[President of Chile]] [[Michelle Bachelet]] was the inaugural executive director, and [[Sima Sami Bahous]] is the current executive director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2021-09-13|title=Gender equality 'champion' Sima Sami Bahous to lead UN Women|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/09/1099802|access-date=2021-09-17|website=UN News|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with UNIFEM previously, UN Women is a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13|title=UNDG Members&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511144047/http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13|archive-date=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==

In response to [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] resolution 63/311, in January 2010 the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] presented the report A/64/588, entitled ''Comprehensive Proposal for the Composite Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women''. In his report, the Secretary-General resolved that, rather than relieving other parts of the United Nations system of their responsibility for contributing to the promotion of [[gender equality]] and women's empowerment, the new entity should seek to sharpen the focus and impact of the gender equality activities of the entire United Nations system. Additionally, Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] estimated that approximately $125 million per annum were needed for operating costs and "start-up" capacity at the country, regional, and headquarters levels. Moreover, an additional $375 million per annum were needed in the initial phase to respond to country-level requests for programmatic support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/64/588 |title=Report on the Secretary General: Comprehensive proposal for the composite entity for gender equality and the empowerment of women |publisher=United Nations |date=2010-01-06|access-date=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of negotiations between [[Member states of the United Nations|UN member states]], women's groups, and [[civil society]], on 2 July 2010 the General Assembly unanimously adopted resolution 64/289, thus creating UN Women by merging the Division for the Advancement of Women (DAW); the [[United Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women|International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women]] (INSTRAW, established in 1976); the Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women (OSAGI, established in 1997), and the UN Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM, established in 1976). Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced at the founding of the movement that he was "grateful to Member States for having taken this major step forward for the world's women and girls. UN Women will significantly boost UN efforts to promote gender equality, expand opportunity, and tackle discrimination around the globe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/ |title=Welcome to UN Women |publisher=Unwomen.org |date=2010-07-02 |access-date=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 September 2010, it was announced that former President of Chile [[Michelle Bachelet]] was appointed as head of UN Women.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=52834 "Michelle Bachelet's Appointment to Head UN Women Widely Applauded"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611014409/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=52834 |date=2011-06-11 }}, ''[[Inter Press Service]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Various countries supported the creation of the body and welcomed Bachelet as chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/65/meetings/generaldebate/View/Sept24.aspx |title=General Debate: 65th Session |publisher=Gadebate.un.org |date=2010-09-29 |access-date=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; During General Debate at the opening of the 65th General Assembly of the UN, world leaders commended the creation of the body and its intention to "empower women", as well as welcoming Bachelet as the inaugural head.&lt;ref&gt;The various speeches from all the world leader from 23-25 &amp; 27–30 September 2010 are listed at http://gadebate.un.org/&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 March 2011, [[John Hendra]] of Canada and [[Lakshmi Puri]] of India were appointed as first deputy executive directors at the level of UN Assistant Secretary-General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2011/3/un-women-assistant-secretaries-general-appointed|title=UN Women Assistant Secretaries-General Appointed|newspaper=Un Women – Headquarters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The provisions set forth by resolution 63/311 on system-wide coherence, adopted by the General Assembly on 2 October 2010, constituted the blueprint for UN Women. Seeking to strengthen the UN's institutional arrangements for gender equality and women empowerment, resolution 63/311 supported the consolidation of four distinct parts of the UN system that focused exclusively on gender equality and women's empowerment into a composite entity to be led by an [[Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations|Under-Secretary-General]]. Moreover, the resolution requested that the Secretary-General produce a proposal specifying the mission statement of the composite entity and its organizational arrangements, including an organizational chart, funding, and the executive board to oversee its operational activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/63/311|title=Resolution on 6/311 on system-wide coherence |publisher=United Nations General Assembly |date=2010-11-09|access-date=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and functioning==
Resolution 64/289 determined that the entity should be headed by an Under-Secretary-General, to be appointed by the Secretary-General in consultation with member states, for a term of four years, with the possibility of renewal for one term.{{fact|date=November 2023}}

The organization is governed by a multi-tiered intergovernmental governance structure in charge of providing normative and operational policy guidance. The General Assembly, [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]], and the [[Commission on the Status of Women]] (CSW) constitute the governance structure that sets forth the normative policy guiding principles of the Entity. The intergovernmental governance structure in charge of providing operational policy guidance to UN Women includes the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and the organization's executive board.{{fact|date=November 2023}} The latter consist of 41 members, elected by the Economic and Social Council for a term of three years and distributed as follows:

* Ten from the Group of African States
* Ten from the Group of Asian States
* Four from the Group of Eastern European States
* Six from the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States
* Five from the Group of Western European and Other States
* Six from contributing countries. Four seats will be selected by and from the top ten largest providers of voluntary core contributions to UN Women. The remaining two seats will be allocated to two developing countries not members of the [[Development Assistance Committee]] of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (DAC/OECD). These two countries will be selected by the developing countries not members of the Development Assistance Committee among the top ten providers of voluntary core contributions to the entity.{{fact|date=November 2023}}

The resources required to fund all normative processes are obtained from the Entity's regular budget and approved by the General Assembly, whereas the budget for service operational processes and activities at all levels are funded from voluntary contributions and approved by the executive board of UN Women.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/64/289 |title=Resolution on 64/289 on system-wide coherence. |publisher=United Nations General Assembly |date=2010-07-21|access-date=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in late 2013, UN Women launched a constitutional database that examines [[constitution]]s through a gender lens. The first of its kind, this database maps the principles and rules that guarantee, deny, or protect the [[Women's rights|rights of women]] and girls around the world. This tool for gender equality and human rights activists is annually updated and searchable, and provides a comprehensive overview of the current status of provisions relevant to women's rights and gender equality across various countries throughout the world. Users can search though the database by keyword, and legal provisions are grouped into 16 categories that were carefully defined by reviewing the constitutions from a human rights perspective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2013/12/un-women-launches-firstever-database-mapping-gender-provisions-in-constitutions-worldwide UN Women Constitutional Database] UN Women, December 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism==
In November 2022 UN Women said on Twitter, "Of all journalists killed in 2021, 11% were women. In 2020, this was 6%. ... STOP TARGETING WOMEN JOURNALISTS," which was criticised Twitter users who pointed out that 89–94% of deaths were male journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The UN Continues to Whine About Problems That Don’t Exist |url=https://www.dailywire.com/episode/the-un-continues-to-whine-about-problems-that-don-t-exist |access-date=2023-11-30 |website=The Daily Wire |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2023 Hamas attack on Israel|Hamas attack on Israel]] on 7 October 2023, feminist groups criticized UN Women for not issuing a clear condemnation of [[Hamas]]'s gender-based [[war crime]]s, and for not taking action to protect female hostages. During the attack, 1,200 Israelis were killed, and at least 240 were taken hostage. Hamas terrorists raped, [[sodomize]]d, [[sexually assaulted]], murdered, beheaded, and mutilated women and children, which was evidenced in interrogations of captured Hamas members, Hamas footage, and the testimony of witnesses.&lt;ref name="hamas"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/un-women-begins-hollow-campaign-to-address-gender-based-violence/|title=U.N. Women Begins Hollow Campaign to Address Gender-Based Violence|date=November 25, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Well over a month after the attack, UN Women's website contained only one reference to women and girls, albeit not Israeli women and girls. Stating the following: “devastating impact of the crisis in Gaza on women and girls.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Algemeiner |first=The |date=2023-11-20 |title=UN, Campus Women’s Groups Silent on, Deny Hamas Rapes of Israelis in Oct. 7 Onslaught - Algemeiner.com |url=https://www.algemeiner.com/2023/11/20/un-campus-womens-groups-silent-deny-hamas-rapes-israelis-oct-7-onslaught/ |access-date=2023-11-21 |website=algemeiner.com |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Opinion {{!}} Why Don’t Israeli Women Count for ‘UN Women’? |url=https://fathomjournal.org/opinion-why-dont-israeli-women-count-for-un-women/ |access-date=2023-11-21 |website=Fathom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter from women's groups criticized UN Women's failure, citing UN Resolution 1325 on women, peace, and security, which calls for protecting women from gender-based violence in armed conflict. The letter urged UN Women to condemn Hamas's attacks, protect human rights, and expose the violent sexual acts perpetuated by Hamas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |date=2023-10-30 |title=“Israeli women are under brutal attack and there is complete silence” |url=https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/hjxrkypma |access-date=2023-11-21 |website=ctech |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
