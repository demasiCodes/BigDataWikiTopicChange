'''Discrimination against atheists''', both at present and historically, includes [[Religious persecution|persecution]] of and [[Religious discrimination|discrimination]] against people identified as [[atheist]]s, whether by themselves or by others. Discrimination against atheists may also comprise negative attitudes, prejudice, hostility, hatred, fear, or intolerance towards atheists and atheism. Because atheism can be defined in various ways, those discriminated against or persecuted on the grounds of being atheists might not have been considered atheists in a different time or place. 13 Muslim countries officially punish atheism or apostasy by death, while "the overwhelming majority" of the 192 United Nation member countries "at best discriminate against citizens who have no belief in a god and at worst can jail them for offences dubbed blasphemy".&lt;ref name="reuters131210"/&gt;

In some [[Muslim world|Muslim-majority countries]], atheists face persecution and severe penalties such as the withdrawal of [[Status (law)|legal status]] or, in the case of [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy]], [[Capital punishment#Islam|capital punishment]].&lt;ref name="Jakarta Globe"&gt;{{cite web | title = ‘God Does Not Exist’ Comment Ends Badly for Indonesia Man | url = http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/god-does-not-exist-comment-ends-badly-for-indonesia-man/492370 | accessdate = 2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient times==
Scholars have argued that some small underdeveloped glimpses of atheism existed in the [[Ancient history|ancient world]], though not in a modern sense because people had not developed a language for nonbelief; [[Theism|theistic]] beliefs in 5th Century BC Greece were not very active in public life the way they are in the modern world, and [[polytheism]] made it difficult to centralize the beliefs of any region or culture.&lt;ref name="whitmarsh"&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitmarsh|first=Tim|title=Battling the Gods: Atheism in the Ancient World|publisher=Knopf|year=2015|isbn=978-0-307-95833-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucien Febvre]] has referred to the "unthinkability" of atheism in its strongest sense before the sixteenth century, because of the "deep religiosity" of that era.  [[Karen Armstrong]] has concurred, writing "from birth and baptism to death and burial in the churchyard, religion dominated the life of every single man and woman. Every activity of the day, which was punctuated by church bells summoning the faithful to prayer, was saturated with religious beliefs and institutions: they dominated professional and public life—even the guilds and the universities were religious organizations. ... Even if an exceptional man could have achieved the objectivity necessary to question the nature of religion and the existence of God, he would have found no support in either the philosophy or the science of his time."&lt;ref name="davidson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Nicholas|title=Atheism from the Reformation to the Enlightenment|editor=Michael Hunter; David Wootton|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992|pages=55–86|chapter=Unbelief and Atheism In Italy|isbn=978-0-19-822736-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong |first=Karen |title=A History of God: The 4000-year Quest of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam |publisher=Random House, Inc. |pages=286–87|year=1994|url= https://books.google.com/?id=_n3cCF2I2FUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+History+of+God| isbn=978-0-345-38456-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kelley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelley|first=Donald R. |title=Frontiers of History: Historical Inquiry in the Twentieth Century |publisher=Yale University Press|year=2006|page=115|isbn=978-0-300-12062-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=K-wVctit5U8C&amp;pg=PA115}}&lt;/ref&gt; As governmental authority rested on the notion of [[Divine right of kings|divine right]], it was threatened by those who denied the existence of the local god.

==Early modern period and Reformation==
{{Further|Atheism in the Age of Enlightenment}}
During the [[early modern period]], the term "atheist" was used as an insult and applied to a broad range of people, including those who held opposing theological beliefs, as well as those who had committed [[suicide]], immoral or self-indulgent people, and even opponents of the belief in witchcraft.&lt;ref name="davidson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google"/&gt;&lt;ref name="laursen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Laursen|first=John Christian |author2=Nederman, Cary J.|title=Beyond the Persecuting Society: Religious Toleration Before the Enlightenment |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=1997|page=142|isbn= 978-0-8122-1567-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=r2j6ZHgXZWkC&amp;pg=PA142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atheistic beliefs were seen as threatening to order and society by philosophers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Lawyer and scholar [[Thomas More]] said that religious tolerance should be extended to all except those who did not believe in a deity or the immortality of the soul.&lt;ref name="gey 250"/&gt; [[John Locke]], a founder of modern notions of religious liberty, argued that atheists (as well as Catholics and Muslims) should not be granted full citizenship rights.&lt;ref name="gey 250"/&gt;

During the [[Inquisition]], several of those accused of atheism or blasphemy, or both, were tortured or executed. These included the priest [[Giulio Cesare Vanini]] who was strangled and burned in 1619 and the Polish nobleman [[Kazimierz Łyszczyński]] who was executed in Warsaw,&lt;ref name="davidson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brooke"&gt;{{cite book|last= Brooke|first=John Hedley|others= Maclean, Ian |title=Heterodoxy in Early Modern Science and Religion |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-926897-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W9o_OEvMQTcC&amp;pg=PA66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kłoczowski |first=Jerzy |title=A History of Polish Christianity |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000 |page=155|isbn=978-0-521-36429-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ecdye8hk_tgC&amp;pg=PA155}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Etienne Dolet]], a Frenchman executed in 1546. Though heralded as atheist martyrs during the nineteenth century, recent scholars hold that the beliefs espoused by Dolet and Vanini are not atheistic in modern terms.&lt;ref name="kelley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="onfray"&gt;{{cite book|last=Onfray|first=Michel|others=Leggatt, Jeremy (translator) |title=Atheist manifesto: the case against Christianity, Judaism, and Islam |publisher=Arcade Publishing|year=2007|page=24|isbn=978-1-55970-820-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QpEAYMo7pFkC&amp;pg=PA24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chadwich"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chadwick |first=Owen |title=The Early Reformation on the Continent By |publisher= Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-19-926578-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VR1yNW8mgoEC&amp;pg=PA413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern era ==
=== Victorian Britain ===
{{Further information|Irreligion in the United Kingdom}}
During the nineteenth century, British atheists, though few in number, were subject to discriminatory practices.&lt;ref name="cookson"&gt;{{cite book | author = Larson, Timothy| chapter= Victorian England | title = Encyclopedia of religious freedom | editor= Cookson, Catharine| publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-415-94181-4 | oclc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] was expelled from the University of Oxford and denied custody of his two children after publishing a pamphlet titled ''[[The Necessity of Atheism]]''.&lt;ref name="gey253" /&gt; Those unwilling to swear Christian oaths during judicial proceedings were unable to give evidence in court to obtain justice until this requirement was repealed by Acts passed in 1869 and 1870.&lt;ref name="cookson"/&gt;

Atheist [[Charles Bradlaugh]] was elected as a [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of the British Parliament]] in 1880. He was denied the right to affirm rather than swear his oath of office, and was then denied the ability to swear the oath as other Members objected that he had himself said it would be meaningless. Bradlaugh was re-elected three times before he was finally able to take his seat in 1886 when the Speaker of the House permitted him to take the oath.&lt;ref name="gey253"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gey|first=Steven G.|title=The Cambridge Companion to Atheism|editor=Martin, Michael|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|chapter=Atheism and the Freedom of Religion|pages=253–255|isbn=978-0-521-84270-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tAeFipOVx4MC&amp;pg=PA253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nazi Germany ===
{{Further information|Irreligion in Nazi Germany}}
In Germany during the Nazi era, a 1933 decree stated that "No National Socialist may suffer detriment... on the ground that he does not make any religious profession at all".&lt;ref name="Baynes"/&gt; However, the regime strongly opposed "godless communism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Christian|title=Disruptive religion: the force of faith in social-movement activism|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|pages=156–57|isbn=978-0-415-91405-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=39SoSG4NGAoC&amp;pg=PA156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stackelberg|first=Roderick|title=The Routledge Companion to Nazi Germany|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|pages=136–8|isbn=978-0-415-30860-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cpXIR9yOMuoC&amp;pg=PA136}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all of Germany's atheist and largely left-wing [[freethought]] organizations such as the [[German Freethinkers League]] (500,000 members)&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1933/05/14/archives/atheist-hall-converted-berlin-churches-establish-bureau-to-win-back.html |title=Atheist Hall Converted: Berlin Churches Establish Bureau to Win Back Worshipers |work=The New York Times |date=May 14, 1933 |page=2 |accessdate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; were banned the same year; some right-wing groups were tolerated by the Nazis until the mid-1930s.&lt;ref name="may"&gt;{{cite book |last= Bock| first= Heike | chapter= Secularization of the modern conduct of life?

During the negotiations leading up to the Nazi-Vatican Concordat of April 26, 1933 Hitler stated that "Secular schools can never be tolerated" because of their irreligious tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Helmreich, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=I6DYAAAAMAAJ The German Churches Under Hitler]''. Detroit: Wayne State Univ. Press, 1979, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler routinely disregarded this undertaking, and the [[Reich concordat]] as a whole and by 1939, all Catholic denominational schools had been disbanded or converted to public facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Richard J. (2005). The Third Reich in Power. New York: Penguin. {{ISBN|978-0-14-303790-3}}; pp. 245-246&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1939, 94.5% of Germans still called themselves Protestant or Catholic, while 3.5% were so-called "''[[Gottgläubig]]en''" (lit. "believers in God") and 1.5% were without faith.&lt;ref name="Ziegler"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ziegler |first=Herbert F. |date=2014 |title=Nazi Germany's New Aristocracy: The SS Leadership, 1925-1939 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBgABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86 |location=Princeton, New Jersey |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=85–87 |isbn=9781400860364 |accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Richard J. Evans]], those members of the affiliation ''gottgläubig'' "were convinced Nazis who had left their Church at the behest of the Party, which had been trying since the mid-1930s to reduce the influence of Christianity in society".&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]]; ''The Third Reich at War''; Penguin Press; New York 2009, p. 546&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinrich Himmler]] was a strong promoter of the ''gottgläubig'' movement and didn't allow atheists into the [[SS]], arguing that their "refusal to acknowledge higher powers" would be a "potential source of indiscipline".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5gcZpnL5QUC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq=gottglaubig&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RVtlU-L_HNGe7AbJ64DoBg&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=gottglaubig&amp;f=false|title=The Third Reich|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Himmler announced to the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]: "We believe in a God Almighty who stands above us; he has created the earth, the Fatherland, and the Volk, and he has sent us the Führer. Any human being who does not believe in God should be considered arrogant, megalomaniacal, and stupid and thus not suited for the SS."&lt;ref name="Ziegler"/&gt;

==Contemporary era==

===Human rights===
{{main|History of human rights}}
Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] is designed to protect the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. In 1993, the UN's human rights committee declared that article 18 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] "protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess any religion or belief".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minorityrights.org/3273/normative-instruments/ccpr-general-comment-22-300793-on-iccpr-article-18.html|title=CCPR General Comment 22: 30/07/93 on ICCPR Article 18|work=Minorityrights.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150116043952/http://www.minorityrights.org/3273/normative-instruments/ccpr-general-comment-22-300793-on-iccpr-article-18.html|archivedate=16 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee further stated that "the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, including the right to replace one's current religion or belief with another or to adopt atheistic views". Signatories to the convention are barred from "the use of threat of physical force or penal sanctions to compel believers or non-believers" to recant their beliefs or convert. Despite this, atheists still are persecuted in some parts of the world.&lt;ref name="fdih1"&gt;{{cite web |date=1 August 2003|title=Discrimination against religious minorities in Iran|author=International Federation for Human Rights|publisher=fdih.org|accessdate=3 March 2009|url=http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/ir0108a.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law2.byu.edu/lawreview/archives/2002/2/dav2.pdf|title=The Evolution of Religious Liberty as a Universal Human Right|accessdate=3 March 2009|last=Davis|first=Derek H.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723210828/http://www.law2.byu.edu/lawreview/archives/2002/2/dav2.pdf|archive-date=23 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western countries===
Modern theories of [[constitutional democracy]] assume that citizens are intellectually and spiritually autonomous and that governments should leave matters of religious belief to individuals and not coerce religious beliefs using sanctions or benefits.  The constitutions, human rights conventions and the religious liberty jurisprudence of most constitutional democracies provide legal protection of atheists and agnostics.  In addition, freedom of expression provisions and legislation separating church from state also serve to protect the rights of atheists. As a result, open legal discrimination against atheists is not common in most Western countries.&lt;ref name="gey 250" /&gt; However, prejudice against atheists does exist in Western countries. A [[UBC|University of British Columbia]] study conducted in the United States found that believers distrusted atheists as much they did [[rapists]]. The study also showed that atheists had lower employment prospects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/Manuscripts/Gervais%20et%20al-%20Atheist%20Distrust.pdf|title=Do You Believe in Atheists?

George H. W. Bush's son, [[George W. Bush]], responded to a question about the role of faith in his presidency during a November 3, 2004 press conference, "I will be your president regardless of your faith. And I don't expect you to agree with me, necessarily, on religion. As a matter of fact, no president should ever try to impose religion on our society.

=====Atheists eligible to hold office=====

''[[Torcaso v.

Jess Melvin argues that atheists were victims of [[genocide]] under the legal definition during the 1965-66 [[Indonesian genocide|Anti-PKI extermination campaign]] (PKI were the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]]) as the Indonesian army proscribed the destruction of "atheist" and "unbelievers" collectively for their association with [[communism]], and according to Matthew Lippmann and David Nersessian [[atheists]] are covered as a protected group in the [[genocide convention]] under "religious group."&lt;ref&gt; Melvin, Jess (2017).

====Iran====
{{Further|Irreligion in Iran}}
Since atheism is not a belief or religion, non-believers are not given legal status in Iran. Declaration of faith in Islam, Christianity, Judaism or Zoroastrianism is required to avail of certain rights such as applying for entrance to university,&lt;ref name="fidh.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/ir0108a.pdf|title=Discrimination against religious minorities in IRAN|date=August 2003|work=Fédération Internationale des Ligues des Droits de l`Homme and the Ligue de Défense des Droits de l'Homme en Iran|accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Iranian Atheists Association: Issues|publisher= Iranian Atheists Association|url= https://iranianatheists.org/issues-1.html|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130924185308/https://iranianatheists.org/issues-1.html|archivedate= 24 September 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; or becoming a lawyer, with the position of judge reserved for Muslims only.&lt;ref&gt;

====Turkey====
{{Further|Irreligion in Turkey}}
Although officially a [[secular state]], the vast majority of Turks are Muslim, and the state grants some special privileges to Muslims and to Islam in the media and private religious institutions. Compulsory religious instruction in [[Turkey|Turkish]] schools is also considered discriminatory towards atheists, who may not want their children to receive any religious education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/47665e602.html|title= A Quest for Equality: Minorities in Turkey|year= 2007|publisher= Minority Rights Group International|accessdate=2009-03-14|quote=Compulsory religious instruction in schools is discriminatory not only against Alevis, as is often emphasized by the EU,195 but also against other non-Sunni Muslims and Sunni Muslims who either do not conform to the Sunni Hanefi faith or do not agree with its official version. It is also discriminatory against atheists, agnostics and secularists, who may not wish their children to receive any religious education.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atheists and agnostics are also not counted in the official census of the country.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Other===
[[Regular Freemasonry]] insists among other things that a volume of scripture is open in a working lodge, that every member profess belief in a Supreme Being, and that the discussion of religion is banned. [[Continental Freemasonry]] is now the general term for the "liberal" jurisdictions which have removed some, or all, of these restrictions.

"Duty to God" is a [[Scout method#Principles|principle of Scouting]] worldwide, though it is applied differently among countries.&lt;ref name="faqs"&gt;{{cite web | year=1998 | url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/scouting/rec.scouting.issues/section-11.html | title = What was Baden-Powell's position on God and Religion in Scouting? | publisher = Faqs | accessdate = 2006-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inquiry"&gt;{{cite web |last=Baden-Powell |first=Robert |year=1912 |url=http://www.inquiry.net/ideals/b-p/religion.htm |title=Baden-Powell on Religion |publisher=Inquiry.net |accessdate=2006-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115192441/http://www.inquiry.net/ideals/b-p/religion.htm |archivedate=2006-11-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) takes a strong position, excluding atheists and [[agnostics]],&lt;ref name="duty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsalegal.org/dutytogo-155.htm|work=BSA Legal Issues|title=Duty to God|publisher=Boy Scouts of America|accessdate=2006-12-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827022542/http://www.bsalegal.org/dutytogo-155.htm|archivedate=2006-08-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dutytogod"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/god-top.html | title = BSA and Religious Belief | publisher = BSA Discrimination.org | accessdate = 2006-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] takes a more neutral position. The [[The Scout Association|United Kingdom Scout Association]] has recently published alternative promises for people of different or no religion, specifying "Atheists, Humanists and people of no specific religion", who make a promise to uphold Scouting values rather than a duty to God. [[Scouts Canada]] defines Duty to God broadly in terms of "adherence to spiritual principles" and does not require members to be part of an organized religion, but does require that they have some form of "personal spirituality".&lt;ref name="bscfaq"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.scouts.ca/ca/frequently-asked-questions |title=Scouts Canada FAQ | publisher = Scouts Canada | accessdate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries, especially in Europe, some Scouting organizations may be [[secularism|secularist]] or religiously neutral (such as [[Eclaireuses et Eclaireurs de France]], [[Corpo Nazionale Giovani Esploratori ed Esploratrici Italiani]] and the ''Baden-Powell Service Association'' in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bpsa-us.org/about/policies-guidelines/|title=BPSA-US Policy &amp; Guidelines|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
