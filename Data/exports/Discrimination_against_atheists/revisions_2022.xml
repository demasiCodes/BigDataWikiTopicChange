'''Discrimination against atheists''', both at present and historically, includes [[Religious persecution|persecution]] of and [[Religious discrimination|discrimination]] against people who are identified as [[Atheism|atheists]]. Discrimination against atheists may also comprise negative attitudes, prejudice, hostility, hatred, fear, or intolerance towards atheists and atheism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Atheists in Lebanon|url=https://www.freethoughtlebanon.net/category/atheists-in-lebanon/|access-date=2021-04-25|website=Freethought Lebanon|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Somin|first=Ilya|title=Atheists May Be the Most Unpopular Minority|url=https://www.law.gmu.edu/assets/files/faculty/Somin_LegalTimes_Prejudice.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because atheism can be defined in various ways, those discriminated against or persecuted on the grounds of being atheists might not have been considered atheists in a different time or place. Thirteen Muslim countries officially punish atheism or apostasy by death and [[Humanists International]] asserts that "the overwhelming majority" of the 193 [[member states of the United Nations]] "at best discriminate against citizens who have no belief in a god and at worst can jail them for offences dubbed blasphemy".&lt;ref name="reuters131210"/&gt;

In some [[Muslim world|Muslim-majority countries]], atheists face persecution and severe penalties such as the withdrawal of [[Status (law)|legal status]] or, in the case of [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy]], [[Capital punishment#Islam|capital punishment]].&lt;ref name="Jakarta Globe"&gt;{{cite web | title = 'God Does Not Exist' Comment Ends Badly for Indonesia Man | url = http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/god-does-not-exist-comment-ends-badly-for-indonesia-man/492370 | access-date = 2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient times==
[[Tim Whitmarsh]] argues atheism existed in the [[Ancient history|ancient world]], though it remains difficult to assess its extent given that atheists are referenced (usually disparagingly) rather than having surviving writings. Given [[monotheism]] at the time was a minority view, atheism generally attacked [[polytheism|polytheistic]] beliefs and associated practices in references found. The word "atheos" (godless) also was used for religious dissent generally (including the monotheists) which complicates study further. Despite these difficulties, Whitmarsh believes that otherwise atheism then was much the same. While atheists (or people perceived as such) were occasionally persecuted, this was rare (perhaps due to being a small group, plus a relative tolerance toward different religious views).&lt;ref name="whitmarsh"&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitmarsh|first=Tim|title=Battling the Gods: Atheism in the Ancient World|publisher=Knopf|year=2015|isbn=978-0-307-95833-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars believe it arose later in the [[early modern period|modern era]]. [[Lucien Febvre]] has referred to the "unthinkability" of atheism in its strongest sense before the sixteenth century, because of the "deep religiosity" of that era. [[Karen Armstrong]] has concurred, writing "from birth and baptism to death and burial in the churchyard, religion dominated the life of every single man and woman. Every activity of the day, which was punctuated by church bells summoning the faithful to prayer, was saturated with religious beliefs and institutions: they dominated professional and public life—even the guilds and the universities were religious organizations. ... Even if an exceptional man could have achieved the objectivity necessary to question the nature of religion and the existence of God, he would have found no support in either the philosophy or the science of his time."&lt;ref name="davidson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Nicholas|title=Atheism from the Reformation to the Enlightenment|editor=Michael Hunter |editor2=David Wootton|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992|pages=55–86|chapter=Unbelief and Atheism in Italy|isbn=978-0-19-822736-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong |first=Karen |title=A History of God: The 4000-year Quest of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam |publisher=Random House, Inc. |pages=286–87|year=1994|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_n3cCF2I2FUC&amp;q=A+History+of+God| isbn=978-0-345-38456-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kelley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelley|first=Donald R. |title=Frontiers of History: Historical Inquiry in the Twentieth Century |publisher=Yale University Press|year=2006|page=115|isbn=978-0-300-12062-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K-wVctit5U8C&amp;pg=PA115}}&lt;/ref&gt; As governmental authority rested on the notion of [[Divine right of kings|divine right]], it was threatened by those who denied the existence of the local god.

==Early modern period and Reformation==
{{Further|Atheism in the Age of Enlightenment}}
During the [[early modern period]], the term "atheist" was used as an insult and applied to a broad range of people, including those who held opposing theological beliefs, as well as those who had committed [[suicide]], immoral or self-indulgent people, and even opponents of the belief in [[witchcraft]].&lt;ref name="davidson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google"/&gt;&lt;ref name="laursen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Laursen|first=John Christian |author2=Nederman, Cary J.|title=Beyond the Persecuting Society: Religious Toleration Before the Enlightenment |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=1997|page=142|isbn= 978-0-8122-1567-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r2j6ZHgXZWkC&amp;pg=PA142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atheistic beliefs were seen as threatening to order and society by philosophers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Lawyer and scholar [[Thomas More]] said that religious tolerance should be extended to all except those who did not believe in a deity or the immortality of the soul.&lt;ref name="gey 250"/&gt; [[John Locke]], a founder of modern notions of religious liberty, argued that atheists (as well as Catholics and Muslims) should not be granted full citizenship rights.&lt;ref name="gey 250"/&gt;

During the [[Inquisition]], several of those who were accused of atheism or blasphemy, or both, were tortured or executed. These included the priest [[Giulio Cesare Vanini]] who was strangled and burned in 1619 and the Polish nobleman [[Kazimierz Łyszczyński]] who was executed in Warsaw,&lt;ref name="davidson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brooke"&gt;{{cite book|last= Brooke|first=John Hedley|others= Maclean, Ian |title=Heterodoxy in Early Modern Science and Religion |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-926897-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W9o_OEvMQTcC&amp;pg=PA66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kłoczowski |first=Jerzy |title=A History of Polish Christianity |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000 |page=155|isbn=978-0-521-36429-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecdye8hk_tgC&amp;pg=PA155}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Etienne Dolet]], a Frenchman executed in 1546. Though heralded as atheist martyrs during the nineteenth century, recent scholars hold that the beliefs espoused by Dolet and Vanini are not atheistic in modern terms.&lt;ref name="kelley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="onfray"&gt;{{cite book|last=Onfray|first=Michel|others=Leggatt, Jeremy (translator) |title=Atheist manifesto: the case against Christianity, Judaism, and Islam |publisher=Arcade Publishing|year=2007|page=24|isbn=978-1-55970-820-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QpEAYMo7pFkC&amp;pg=PA24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chadwich"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chadwick |first=Owen |title=The Early Reformation on the Continent By |publisher= Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-19-926578-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VR1yNW8mgoEC&amp;pg=PA413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baruch Spinoza]] was effectively excommunicated from the [[Sephardic Jewish]] community of [[Amsterdam]] for atheism, though he did not claim to be an atheist.

== Modern era ==
=== Victorian Britain ===
{{Further|Irreligion in the United Kingdom}}
During the nineteenth century, British atheists, though few in number, were subject to discriminatory practices.&lt;ref name="cookson"&gt;{{cite book | author = Larson, Timothy | chapter = Victorian England | title = Encyclopedia of religious freedom | editor = Cookson, Catharine | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-415-94181-5 | chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofre0000unse | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofre0000unse }}&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] was expelled from the University of Oxford and denied custody of his two children after publishing a pamphlet titled ''[[The Necessity of Atheism]]''.&lt;ref name="gey253" /&gt; Those not willing to swear Christian oaths during judicial proceedings were unable to give evidence in court to obtain justice until this requirement was repealed by Acts passed in 1869 and 1870.&lt;ref name="cookson"/&gt;

Atheist [[Charles Bradlaugh]] was elected as a [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of the British Parliament]] in 1880. He was denied the right to affirm rather than swear his oath of office, and was then denied the ability to swear the oath as other Members objected that he had himself said it would be meaningless. Bradlaugh was re-elected three times before he was finally able to take his seat in 1886 when the Speaker of the House permitted him to take the oath.&lt;ref name="gey253"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gey|first=Steven G.|title=The Cambridge Companion to Atheism|editor=Martin, Michael|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|chapter=Atheism and the Freedom of Religion|pages=253–255|isbn=978-0-521-84270-9|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tAeFipOVx4MC&amp;pg=PA253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the negotiations which led up to the Nazi-Vatican ''[[Reichskonkordat]]'' of 26 April 1933 Hitler stated that "Secular schools can never be tolerated" because of their irreligious tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Helmreich, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=I6DYAAAAMAAJ The German Churches Under Hitler]''. Detroit: Wayne State Univ. Press, 1979, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler routinely disregarded this undertaking, and the ''Reichskonkordat'' as a whole, and by 1939, all Catholic denominational schools had been disbanded or converted to public facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Richard J. (2005). The Third Reich in Power. New York: Penguin. {{ISBN|978-0-14-303790-3}}; pp. 245–246&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1939, 94.5% of Germans still called themselves [[Protestantism|Protestant]] or [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], while 3.5% were so-called "''[[Gottgläubig]]e''" (lit. "believers in God") and 1.5% were without faith.&lt;ref name="Ziegler"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ziegler |first=Herbert F. |date=2014 |title=Nazi Germany's New Aristocracy: The SS Leadership, 1925–1939 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBgABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86 |location=Princeton, New Jersey |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=85–87 |isbn=9781400860364 |access-date=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Richard J.

Evans]]; ''The Third Reich at War''; Penguin Press; New York 2009, p. 546&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinrich Himmler]] was a strong promoter of the ''gottgläubig'' movement and did not allow atheists into the [[SS]], arguing that their "refusal to acknowledge higher powers" would be a "potential source of indiscipline".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5gcZpnL5QUC&amp;q=gottglaubig&amp;pg=PA196|title=The Third Reich|access-date=5 March 2015|isbn=9780330475501|last1=Burleigh|first1=Michael|date=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Himmler announced to the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]: "We believe in a God Almighty who stands above us; he has created the earth, the Fatherland, and the Volk, and he has sent us the Führer. Any human being who does not believe in God should be considered arrogant, megalomaniacal, and stupid and thus not suited for the SS."&lt;ref name="Ziegler"/&gt; The [[SS oath]] (''Eidformel der Schutzstaffel''), written by Himmler, also specifically denounced atheists, repeating the sentiments above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/Himmler-Heinrich-Die-Schutzstaffel/page/n13/mode/2up|title=Die Schutzstaffel als antibolschewistische Kampforganisation|access-date=5 May 2020|last1=Himmler|first1=Heinrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===
{{main|History of human rights}}
{{Further information|Capital punishment for non-violent offenses#Apostasy and blasphemy}}
Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] is designed to protect the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. In 1993, the UN's human rights committee declared that article 18 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] "protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess any religion or belief".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minorityrights.org/3273/normative-instruments/ccpr-general-comment-22-300793-on-iccpr-article-18.html|title=CCPR General Comment 22: 30/07/93 on ICCPR Article 18|work=Minorityrights.org|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150116043952/http://www.minorityrights.org/3273/normative-instruments/ccpr-general-comment-22-300793-on-iccpr-article-18.html|archive-date=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee further stated that "the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, including the right to replace one's current religion or belief with another or to adopt atheistic views". Signatories to the convention are barred from "the use of threat of physical force or penal sanctions to compel believers or non-believers" to recant their beliefs or convert. Despite this, atheists still are persecuted in some parts of the world.&lt;ref name="fdih1"&gt;{{cite web |date=1 August 2003|title=Discrimination against religious minorities in Iran|author=International Federation for Human Rights|publisher=fdih.org|access-date=3 March 2009|url=http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/ir0108a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law2.byu.edu/lawreview/archives/2002/2/dav2.pdf|title=The Evolution of Religious Liberty as a Universal Human Right|access-date=3 March 2009|last=Davis|first=Derek H.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723210828/http://www.law2.byu.edu/lawreview/archives/2002/2/dav2.pdf|archive-date=23 July 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western countries===
Modern theories of [[constitutional democracy]] assume that citizens are intellectually and spiritually autonomous and that governments should leave matters of religious belief to individuals and not coerce religious beliefs using sanctions or benefits. The constitutions, human rights conventions and the religious liberty jurisprudence of most constitutional democracies provide legal protection of atheists and agnostics. In addition, freedom of expression provisions and legislation separating church from state also serve to protect the rights of atheists. As a result, open legal discrimination against atheists is not common in most Western countries.&lt;ref name="gey 250" /&gt; However, prejudice against atheists does exist in Western countries. A 2011 study conducted in the United States by the [[UBC|University of British Columbia]] found that believers distrusted atheists as much they did [[rapists]]. The study also showed that atheists had lower employment prospects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/Manuscripts/Gervais%20et%20al-%20Atheist%20Distrust.pdf|title=Do You Believe in Atheists?

[[George H. W. Bush]]'s son, [[George W.

And I don't expect you to agree with me, necessarily, on religion. As a matter of fact, no president should ever try to impose religion on our society.

=====Atheists eligible to hold office=====

''[[Torcaso v.

The [[Constitution of Bangladesh]] ensures [[secularism]] and right to religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh|url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-367.html|access-date=2020-07-01|website=bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the controversial [[Digital Security Act]] (DSA), passed in 2018, provides provisions against blasphemous expressions: 

:Article 28, Section 1&lt;br /&gt;"If any person or group willingly or knowingly publishes or broadcasts or causes to publish or broadcast anything in website or any electronic format which hurts religious sentiment or values, with an intention to hurt or provoke the religious values or sentiments, then such act of the person shall be an offence."&lt;ref name="dsabd"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Digital Security Act 2020|url=https://www.cirt.gov.bd/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Digital-Security-Act-2020.pdf|access-date=2021-04-26|website=www.cirt.gov.bd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The penalty under Section 2 and 3 of Article 28 of the Digital Security Act is a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years or a fine of [[Bangladeshi taka|BDT]] 1 million, or both. A person that commits the same offense several times is subject to imprisonment for up to 10 years or a “fine not exceeding Taka 20 lac (BDT 2 Million), or with both.”&lt;ref name="dsabd" /&gt;
Allegedly, DSA is being used to prosecute any person for atheistic remarks.

Religious Education is a mandatory subject in Bangladeshi public curricula from Grade-3 (Ages 8 to 9 usually), and even though Religious Education is required from Grade-3 onwards, most public and private schools have Religious Education since Grade-1 (Ages 6 to 7 usually), and most children are given Religious Education from a young age, and most children from Muslim households in Bangladesh can read the Qur'an by the time they are 8 or 9. Religion is also a mandatory elective needed in order for a student to sit for their [[Secondary School Certificate#Bangladesh|SSCs]]. Although Atheism is frowned upon, no atheists have ever been given death sentence for apostasy since the birth of the country. Some Bangladeshi atheists have been assassinated by various local Islamic extremist organizations, but the Government has taken strict measures and has since banned the Islamist groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=bdnews24.com|first=Staff Correspondent|title=Ansar al-Islam banned in Bangladesh|url=https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2017/03/05/ansar-al-islam-banned-in-bangladesh|access-date=2020-07-01|website=bdnews24.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Indonesian genocide=====
{{main|Indonesian mass killings of 1965–1966}}
Jess Melvin argues that atheists were victims of [[genocide]] under the legal definition of the term during the 1965–66 [[Indonesian genocide|Anti-PKI extermination campaign]] (PKI were the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]]) as the [[Indonesian Army]] called for the destruction of "atheist" and "unbelievers" collectively for their association with [[communism]] and, according to Matthew Lippmann and David Nersessian, [[atheists]] are covered as a protected group in the [[genocide convention]] under "religious group."&lt;ref&gt;Melvin, Jess (2017).

====Iran====
{{Further|Irreligion in Iran}}
Since atheism is not a belief nor a religion, non-believers are not given legal status in Iran. Declaration of faith in Islam, Christianity, Judaism or Zoroastrianism is required to avail of certain rights such as applying for entrance to university,&lt;ref name="fidh.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/ir0108a.pdf|title=Discrimination against religious minorities in IRAN|date=August 2003|work=Fédération Internationale des Ligues des Droits de l`Homme and the Ligue de Défense des Droits de l'Homme en Iran|access-date=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Iranian Atheists Association: Issues|publisher= Iranian Atheists Association|url= https://iranianatheists.org/issues-1.html|url-status=dead|archive-url= https://archive.today/20130924185308/https://iranianatheists.org/issues-1.html|archive-date= 24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or becoming a lawyer, with the position of judge reserved for Muslims only.&lt;ref&gt;

In March 2014, the Saudi interior ministry issued a royal decree branding all atheists as terrorists, which defines [[terrorism]] as "calling for atheist thought in any form, or calling into question the fundamentals of the Islamic religion on which this country is based".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Withnall |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-declares-all-atheists-are-terrorists-in-new-law-to-crack-down-on-political-dissidents-9228389.html |title=Saudi Arabia declares all atheists are terrorists in new law to crack down on political dissidents – Middle East – World |work=The Independent|date=1 April 2014 |access-date=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Turkey====
{{Further|Irreligion in Turkey}}
Although officially a [[secular state]], the vast majority of Turks are Muslim, and the state grants some special privileges to Muslims and to Islam in the media and private religious institutions. Compulsory religious instruction in [[Turkey|Turkish]] schools is also considered discriminatory towards atheists, who may not want their children to receive any religious education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/47665e602.html|title= A Quest for Equality: Minorities in Turkey|year= 2007|publisher= Minority Rights Group International|access-date=2009-03-14|quote=Compulsory religious instruction in schools is discriminatory not only against Alevis, as is often emphasized by the EU,195 but also against other non-Sunni Muslims and Sunni Muslims who either do not conform to the Sunni Hanefi faith or do not agree with its official version. It is also discriminatory against atheists, agnostics and secularists, who may not wish their children to receive any religious education.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
{{Further|Irreligion in India}}
[[Sanal Edamaruku]], atheist and founder-president of [[Rationalist International]], had to flee India in 2012, when the [[Catholic Secular Forum]] pressed charges against him under [[Section 295(A)]] of the [[Indian Penal Code]], which penalises outraging the religious sentiments of any citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer, R (March–April 2013). "Blasphemy, Free Speech, and Rationalism: An Interview with Sanal Edamaruku". The Humanist. Retrieved 2013-02-23."Blasfemia, libertad de expresión, y el racionalismo: Una entrevista con Sanal Edamaruku". The Humanist/Europa Laicismo. March 2013. Retrieved 2013-02-23.&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently in self-exile in [[Finland]] to avoid arrest and indefinite jail time.&lt;ref&gt;Sims, Paul. "Sanal Edamaruku: an update". 18 June 2012. New Humanist Magazine. Retrieved 1 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Indian society, [[rationalist]]s have been generally considered undeclared [[atheists]] because they tend to label all sorts of religious activities as [[superstition]]. So they have been stigmatized and avoided by most [[Hindus]]. [[Indian Muslims]] and [[Indian Christians|Christians]] are traditionally opposed to atheism. However in ancient India, atheistic schools of thought, such as [[Charvaka]] and [[Ajivika]] existed alongside [[Buddhism]] during the latter's early days.{{cn|date=September 2021}}

===Other===
[[Regular Freemasonry]] insists among other things that a volume of scripture is open in a working lodge, that every member profess belief in a Supreme Being, and that the discussion of religion is banned. [[Continental Freemasonry]] is now the general term for the "liberal" jurisdictions which have removed some, or all, of these restrictions.

"Duty to God" is a [[Scout method#Principles|principle of Scouting]] worldwide, though it is applied differently among countries.&lt;ref name="faqs"&gt;{{cite web | year=1998 | url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/scouting/rec.scouting.issues/section-11.html | title = What was Baden-Powell's position on God and Religion in Scouting? | publisher = Faqs | access-date = 2006-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inquiry"&gt;{{cite web |last=Baden-Powell |first=Robert |year=1912 |url=http://www.inquiry.net/ideals/b-p/religion.htm |title=Baden-Powell on Religion |publisher= Inquiry.net |access-date=2006-12-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115192441/http://www.inquiry.net/ideals/b-p/religion.htm |archive-date=2006-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) takes a strong position, excluding atheists and [[agnostics]],&lt;ref name="duty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsalegal.org/dutytogo-155.htm|work=BSA Legal Issues|title=Duty to God|publisher=Boy Scouts of America|access-date=2006-12-03|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827022542/http://www.bsalegal.org/dutytogo-155.htm|archive-date=2006-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dutytogod"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/god-top.html | title = BSA and Religious Belief | publisher = BSA Discrimination.org | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070120110841/http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/god-top.html | archive-date = 20 January 2007 | date = 22 January 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] takes a more neutral position. The [[The Scout Association|United Kingdom Scout Association]] has recently published alternative promises for people of different or no religion, specifying "Atheists, Humanists and people of no specific religion", who make a promise to uphold Scouting values rather than a duty to God. [[Scouts Canada]] defines Duty to God broadly in terms of "adherence to spiritual principles" and does not require members to be part of an organized religion, but does require that they have some form of "personal spirituality".&lt;ref name="bscfaq"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.scouts.ca/about/faq.html |title=Scouts Canada FAQ | publisher = Scouts Canada | access-date= 20 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries, especially in Europe, some Scouting organizations may be [[secularism|secularist]] or religiously neutral (such as [[Eclaireuses et Eclaireurs de France]], [[Corpo Nazionale Giovani Esploratori ed Esploratrici Italiani]] and the ''Baden-Powell Service Association'' in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bpsa-us.org/policies-and-guidelines|title=BPSA-US Policy &amp; Guidelines}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
