}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes the [[Religious persecution|persecution]] and [[Religious discrimination|discrimination]] faced by [[atheism|atheists]] and those labeled as atheists in the past and in the current era. Differing definitions of atheism historically and culturally mean those discriminated against might not be considered truly atheist by modern Western standards.

In constitutional democracies, legal discrimination against atheists is uncommon, but some atheists and atheist groups, particularly those in the [[United States]], have protested laws, regulations and institutions they view as being discriminatory. In some Islamic countries, atheists face discrimination including lack of legal status or even a [[capital punishment#Islam|death sentence]] in the case of [[apostacy in Islam|apostasy]].

==Ancient times==
Historians including [[Lucien Febvre]] agree atheism in its modern sense did not exist before the end of the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="davidson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Nicholas|title=Atheism from the Reformation to the Enlightenment|editor=Michael Hunter; David Wootton|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992|pages=55–86|chapter=Unbelief and Atheism In Italy|isbn=978-0-19-822736-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong |first=Karen |title=A History of God: The 4000-year Quest of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam |publisher=Random House, Inc. |pages=286–87|year=1994|url= http://books.google.com/?id=_n3cCF2I2FUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+History+of+God| isbn=978-0-345-38456-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kelley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelley|first=Donald R. |title=Frontiers of History: Historical Inquiry in the Twentieth Century |publisher=Yale University Press|year=2006|page=115|isbn=978-0-300-12062-2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=K-wVctit5U8C&amp;pg=PA115}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as governmental authority rested on the notion of [[Divine right of kings|divine right]], it was threatened by those who denied the existence of the local god. Philosophers such as [[Plato]] argued that atheism (as we understand it today) was a danger to society and should be punished as a crime.&lt;ref name="gey 250"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gey|first=Steven G.|title=The Cambridge Companion to Atheism|editor=Martin, Michael|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|chapter=Atheism and the Freedom of Religion|pages=250–253, 260–2 |isbn=978-0-521-84270-9|url=http://books.google.com/?id=tAeFipOVx4MC&amp;pg=PA250}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those labeled as atheist, which included early Christians and Muslims, were as a result targeted for legal persecution.&lt;ref name="gey 250"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong |first=Karen |title=A History of God: The 4000-year Quest of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam |publisher=Random House, Inc. |pages=98, 147|year=1994|url= http://books.google.com/?id=_n3cCF2I2FUC&amp;printsec=frontcover|isbn=978-0-345-38456-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early modern period and Reformation==
During the [[Early modern period]], the term "atheist" was used as an insult and applied to a broad range of people, including those who held opposing theological beliefs, as well as suicides, immoral or self-indulgent people, and even opponents of the belief in witchcraft.&lt;ref name="davidson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google"/&gt;&lt;ref name="laursen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Laursen|first=John Christian |coauthors=Nederman, Cary J.|title=Beyond the Persecuting Society: Religious Toleration Before the Enlightenment |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=1997|page=142|isbn= 978-0-8122-1567-0|url=http://books.google.com/?id=r2j6ZHgXZWkC&amp;pg=PA142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atheistic beliefs were seen as threatening to order and society by philosophers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Lawyer and scholar [[Thomas More]] said that religious tolerance should be extended to all except those who did not believe in a deity or the immortality of the soul.&lt;ref name="gey 250"/&gt; [[John Locke]], a founder of modern notions of religious liberty, argued that atheists (as well as Catholics and Muslims) should not be granted full citizenship rights.&lt;ref name="gey 250"/&gt;

During the Inquisition, several of those accused of atheism or blasphemy, or both, were tortured or executed. These included a priest [[Giulio Cesare Vanini]] who was strangled and burned in 1619 and a Polish nobleman [[Kazimierz Łyszczyński]] who was executed in Warsaw,&lt;ref name="davidson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brooke"&gt;{{cite book|last= Brooke|first=John Hedley|others= Maclean, Ian |title=Heterodoxy in Early Modern Science and Religion |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-926897-9|url=http://books.google.com/?id=W9o_OEvMQTcC&amp;pg=PA66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kłoczowski |first=Jerzy |title=A History of Polish Christianity |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000 |page=155|isbn=978-0-521-36429-4|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ecdye8hk_tgC&amp;pg=PA155}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Etienne Dolet]], a Frenchman executed in 1546. Though heralded as atheist martyrs during the nineteenth century, recent scholars hold that the beliefs espoused by Dolet and Vanini are not atheistic in modern terms.&lt;ref name="kelley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="onfray"&gt;{{cite book|last=Onfray|first=Michel|others=Leggatt, Jeremy (translator) |title=Atheist manifesto: the case against Christianity, Judaism, and Islam |publisher=Arcade Publishing|year=2007|page=24|isbn=978-1-55970-820-3|url=http://books.google.com/?id=QpEAYMo7pFkC&amp;pg=PA24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chadwich"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chadwick |first=Owen |title=The Early Reformation on the Continent By |publisher= Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-19-926578-7|url=http://books.google.com/?id=VR1yNW8mgoEC&amp;pg=PA413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era==
During the nineteenth century, British atheists, though few in number, were subject to discriminatory practices.&lt;ref name="cookson"&gt;{{cite book | author = Larson, Timothy| chapter= Victorian England | title = Encyclopedia of religious freedom | editor= Cookson, Catharine| publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-415-94181-4 | oclc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those unwilling to swear Christian oaths during judicial proceedings were unable to give evidence in court to obtain justice until the requirement was repealed by Acts passed in 1869 and 1870.&lt;ref name="cookson"/&gt; In addition, the poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] was expelled from the University of Oxford and denied custody of his two children after publishing a pamphlet on ''[[The Necessity of Atheism]]''.&lt;ref name="gey253" /&gt;

Atheist [[Charles Bradlaugh]] was elected as a [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of the British Parliament]] in 1880. He was denied the right to affirm rather than swear his oath of office, and was then denied the ability to swear the oath as other Members objected that he had himself said it would be meaningless. Bradlaugh was re-elected three times before he was finally able to take his seat in 1886 when the Speaker of the House permitted him to take the oath.&lt;ref name="gey253"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gey|first=Steven G.|title=The Cambridge Companion to Atheism|editor=Martin, Michael|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|chapter=Atheism and the Freedom of Religion|pages=253–255|isbn=978-0-521-84270-9|url=http://books.google.com/?id=tAeFipOVx4MC&amp;pg=PA253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazi Germany===
In Germany during the Nazi era, a 1933 decree stated that "No National Socialist may suffer detriment... on the ground that he does not make any religious profession at all".&lt;ref name="Baynes"/&gt; However, the regime strongly opposed "godless communism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Christian|title=Disruptive religion: the force of faith in social-movement activism|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|pages=156–57|isbn=978-0-415-91405-5|url=http://books.google.com/?id=39SoSG4NGAoC&amp;pg=PA156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stackelberg|first=Roderick|title=The Routledge Companion to Nazi Germany	|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|pages=136–8|isbn=978-0-415-30860-1|url=http://books.google.com/?id=cpXIR9yOMuoC&amp;pg=PA136}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most of Germany's atheist and largely left-wing [[freethought]] organizations were banned the same year; some right-wing groups were tolerated by the Nazis until the mid 1930s.&lt;ref name="may"&gt;{{cite book |last= Bock| first= Heike | chapter= Secularization of the modern conduct of life?

Detroit: Wayne State Univ. Press, 1979, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech made later in 1933, Hitler claimed to have "stamped [Gottlosenbewegung] out".&lt;ref name="Baynes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baynes|first=Norman Hepburn|title=The Speeches of Adolf Hitler, April 1922 – August 1939'|publisher=H.

==Contemporary era==

===Western countries===
Modern theories of constitutional democracy assume that citizens are intellectually and spiritually autonomous and that governments should leave matters of religious belief to individuals and not coerce religious beliefs using sanctions or benefits.  The constitutions, human rights conventions and the religious liberty jurisprudence of most constitutional democracies provides legal protection of atheists and agnostics.  In addition, freedom of expression provisions and legislation separating church from state also serve to protect the rights of atheists. As a result, open legal discrimination against atheists is not common in most Western countries.&lt;ref name="gey 250" /&gt; However, prejudice against atheists does exist in Western countries. A [[UBC|University of British Columbia]] study found that believers distrust atheists as much as [[rapist]]s. The study also showed that atheists have lower employment prospects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~will/Gervais%20et%20al-%20Atheist%20Distrust.pdf|title=Do You Believe in Atheists?

Atheism, lack of religious observation and regular church attendance, and the inability to prove one's willingness and capacity to attend to religion with his children, have been used to deny custody to non-religious parents.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/custody.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitzer.edu/academics/faculty/zuckerman/Zuckerman_on_Atheism.pdf Atheism, Secularity, and Well-Being: How the Findings of Social Science Counter Negative Stereotypes and Assumptions Phil Zuckerman]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic countries===
Atheists, or those accused of holding atheistic beliefs, may be subject to discrimination and persecution in some Islamic countries. According to popular interpretations of Islam, Muslims are not free to change religion or become an atheist: denying Islam and thus becoming an [[apostasy|apostate]] is traditionally punished by death in men and by life imprisonment in women. The death penalty for apostasy is apparent in a range of Islamic states including: [[Iran]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/3179465/Hanged-for-being-a-Christian-in-Iran.html The Telegraph, "Hanged for Being a Christian in Iran]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/01/31/uk-iran-execution-apostasy-idUKTRE70U41D20110131 Reuters, "Iran hangs man convicted of apostasy"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/sep/17/supportingislamsapostates, "Supporting Islam's apostates"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pakistan]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/sep/17/supportingislamsapostates, "Supporting Islam's apostates"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Somalia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7833621.stm BBC news, "Somali executed for 'apostasy'"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Arab Emirates]],&lt;ref&gt;http://freedomcenterstudents.org/2010/05/crimes-punishable-by-death-in-the-uae-include-apostasy/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Qatar]],&lt;ref name=barnabasfund&gt;[http://www.barnabasfund.org/news/archives/article.php?ID_news_items=295 Copyright © 2007 Barnabas Fund | Islamic Teaching on the Consequences of Apostasy from Islam]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yemen]],&lt;ref name=barnabasfund/&gt; and [[Saudi Arabia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/sep/17/supportingislamsapostates, "Supporting Islam's apostates"]&lt;/ref&gt; although there have been no recently reported executions in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/World/20060327/muslims_conversion_060327/  CTV news, "'Apostasy' laws widespread in Muslim world"], quote: "Islamic Shariah law considers conversion to any religion apostasy and most Muslim scholars agree the punishment is death. Saudi Arabia considers Shariah the law of the land, though there have been no reported cases of executions of converts from Islam in recent memory."&lt;/ref&gt; Since an apostate can be considered a Muslim whose beliefs cast doubt on the Divine, and/or [[Koran]], claims of atheism and [[apostasy]] have been made against Muslim scholars and political opponents throughout history.&lt;ref name="kamrava"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamrava|first=Mehran|title=The new voices of Islam: reforming politics and modernity : a reader |publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2006|pages=123–24|isbn=978-1-84511-275-2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=wTYJv7mwCoIC&amp;pg=PA123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn90-411-1105-0"&gt;{{cite book| last = Hamad|first= Ahmad| chapter= Legal plurality and legitimation of human rights abuses | editors = Al-Zwaini, Laila; Baudouin Dupret; Berger, Maurits | title = Legal pluralism in the Arab world | publisher = Kluwer Law International | location = The Hague | year = 1999 | page = 221 | isbn = 90-411-1105-0 | oclc = | url = http://books.google.com/?id=VAcOB1eMa5QC&amp;pg=PA221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="apost"&gt;{{cite book | author = Zaki Badawi, M.A.| chapter= Islam | title = Encyclopedia of religious freedom | editor= Cookson, Catharine| publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2003 | pages = 204–8| isbn = 0-415-94181-4 | oclc = | url = http://books.google.com/?id=R0PrjC1Ar7gC&amp;pg=PA206 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Egypt]], intellectuals suspected of holding atheistic beliefs have been prosecuted by judicial and religious authorities.  Novelist Alaa Hamad was convicted of publishing a book that contained atheistic ideas and apostasy that were considered to threaten national unity and social peace.&lt;ref name="boyle"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyle|first=Kevin|coauthors=Sheen, Juliet |title=Freedom of Religion and Belief: A World Report  |publisher=Routledge |year=1997|page=30|isbn=978-0-415-15978-4|url=http://books.google.com/?id=MFUZkWWgOtMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="al"&gt;{{cite book | author =Al-Boray, Nagad | chapter= Egypt| title = Secrecy and Liberty: National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Information (International Studies in Human Rights) | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | year = 1999 | isbn = 90-411-1191-3 | oclc = | url = http://books.google.com/?id=72IynQKXt3sC&amp;pg=PA251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Algeria====
The study of Islam is a requirement in public and private schools for every Algerian child, irrespective of his/her religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.algerie-dz.com/article841.html|title=Ecoles privées en Algérie : Plaidoyer pour le bilinguisme|language=French|accessdate=29 August 2010|date=30 June 2004|author=Djamila Kourta|work=[[El Watan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atheist or agnostic men are prohibited from marrying Muslim women ([[Algerian Family Code]] I.II.31).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexalgeria.net/droitdelafamille.htm |title=de beste bron van informatie over Lexalgeria.

Atheists and agnostics cannot inherit (Family Code III.I.138.).

===Other===
Compulsory religious instruction in [[Turkey|Turkish]] schools is also considered discriminatory towards atheists.&lt;ref&gt;
