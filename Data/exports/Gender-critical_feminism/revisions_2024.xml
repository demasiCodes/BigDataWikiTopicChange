Gender-critical feminists equate "women" with what they consider to be a "female sex class", and view historical and contemporary oppression of women as being rooted in their being female, while "gender" is a system of social norms which functions to oppress women on the basis of their sex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Woman as Resource: A Reply to Catharine MacKinnon - The Philosophers' Magazine |url=https://www.philosophersmag.com/essays/318-woman-as-resource-a-reply-to-catharine-mackinnon |access-date=21 October 2023 |website=www.philosophersmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kodsi |first1=Daniel |title=Who is feminism for? |date=3 July 2022 |url=https://thecritic.co.uk/who-is-feminism-for/ |access-date=14 August 2023 |archive-date=14 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230814084232/https://thecritic.co.uk/who-is-feminism-for/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe sex is biological and cannot be changed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brione |first1=Patrick |title=Employment Tribunal rulings on gender-critical beliefs in the workplace |url=https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/employment-tribunal-rulings-on-gender-critical-beliefs-in-the-workplace |access-date=14 August 2023 |archive-date=10 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230710111234/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/employment-tribunal-rulings-on-gender-critical-beliefs-in-the-workplace/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that equity legislation protecting against discrimination based on sex should be interpreted as solely referring to biological sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Elgot |first1=Jessica |title=Kemi Badenoch could rewrite law to allow trans exclusion from single-sex spaces |url=https://amp.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/04/kemi-badenoch-could-rewrite-law-to-allow-trans-exclusion-from-single-sex-spaces |access-date=14 August 2023 |work=The Guardian |date=4 April 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|reason=Source only mentions gender-critical views in passing and doesn't really describe this as a core attribute of them, just as a position some groups took in one legal dispute.|date=October 2024}} Furthermore, gender critics emphasise the view that sex is binary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cowan |first1=Sharon |last2=Morris |first2=Sean |title=Should 'Gender Critical' Views about Trans People Be Protected as Philosophical Beliefs in the Workplace?

In gender-critical discourse, the terms ''man'' and ''woman'' are used as sex-terms, assigned no more meaning than ''adult human male'' and ''adult human female'' respectively, in contrast to feminist theorists who argue these terms embody a social category distinct from matters of biology (usually referred to as ''gender''), with ''masculinity'' and ''femininity'' representing normative characteristics thereof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-gender/#SexDis |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=15 August 2023 |archive-date=1 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220601002408/https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-gender/#SexDis |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Byrne |first1=Alex |title=Are women adult human females? |journal=Philosophical Studies |date=January 2020 |volume=177 |issue=12 |page=22 |doi=10.1007/s11098-019-01408-8 |hdl=1721.1/128358 |s2cid=254943344 |url=https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/128358/11098_2019_1408_ReferencePDF.pdf |access-date=15 August 2023 |archive-date=28 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240828042322/https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/128358/11098_2019_1408_ReferencePDF.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''adult human female'' has become a [[slogan]] in gender-critical politics, and has been described as transphobic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woman billboard removed after transphobia row |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45650462 |access-date=15 August 2023 |work=BBC News |date=26 September 2018 |archive-date=28 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240828042326/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45650462 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender critical feminists advocate what they call "sex-based rights", arguing that "women's human rights are based upon sex" and that "these rights are being eroded by the promotion of 'gender identity'".&lt;ref name="HinesSocRev"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hines |first1=Sally |title=Sex wars and (trans) gender panics: Identity and body politics in contemporary UK feminism |journal=[[The Sociological Review]] |date=2020 |volume=68 |issue=4 |pages=699–717 |doi=10.1177/0038026120934684 |s2cid=221097483 |url=https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/163972/8/0038026120934684.pdf |access-date=16 June 2023 |archive-date=14 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211214191345/https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/163972/8/0038026120934684.pdf |url-status=live |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights scholar Sandra Duffy described the concept of "sex-based rights" as "a fiction with the pretense of legality", noting that the word "sex" in [[international human rights law]] does not share the implications of the word "sex" in gender-critical discourse and is widely agreed to also refer to [[gender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Duffy |first1=Sandra |title=An International Human Rights Law Analysis of the WHRC Declaration |date=26 October 2021 |url=https://sandraduffy.wordpress.com/2021/10/26/an-international-human-rights-law-analysis-of-the-whrc-declaration/ |access-date=4 December 2021 |archive-date=16 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220616105029/https://sandraduffy.wordpress.com/2021/10/26/an-international-human-rights-law-analysis-of-the-whrc-declaration/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catharine A. MacKinnon]] noted that "the recognition [that discrimination against trans people is discrimination on the basis of sex, that is gender, the social meaning of sex] does not, contrary to allegations of anti-trans self-identified feminists, endanger women or feminism", they expand by saying "women do not have 'sex-based rights' in the affirmative sense some in this group seem to think".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacKinnon |first1=Catharine A. |author-link=Catharine A.

=== Socialisation and gender nonconformity ===
Gender critical feminists generally see gender as a system in which women are oppressed for reasons intrinsically related to their sex, and emphasize male violence against women, particularly involving institutions such as the [[sex industry]], as central to women's oppression.&lt;ref name="McKay 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mackay |first1=Finn |title=Radical Feminism |journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society |date=December 2015 |volume=32 |issue=7–8 |pages=332–336 |doi=10.1177/0263276415616682 |s2cid=220719287 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bettcher |first1=Talia Mae |editor1-last=Disch |editor1-first=Lisa |editor2-last=Hawkesworth |editor2-first=Mary |title=The Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theory |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199328581 |pages=407–427 |chapter=Intersexuality, transgender and transsexuality|year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Holders of such views often contend that trans women cannot fully be women because they were assigned male at birth and have experienced some degree of [[male privilege]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schmidt |first1=Samantha |title=Women's issues are different from trans women's issues, feminist author says, sparking criticism |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/03/13/womens-issues-are-different-from-trans-womens-issues-feminist-author-says-sparking-criticism/?noredirect=on |access-date=11 October 2018 |agency=Washington Post |date=13 March 2017 |archive-date=17 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181017045301/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/03/13/womens-issues-are-different-from-trans-womens-issues-feminist-author-says-sparking-criticism/?noredirect=on |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germaine Greer]] has said that it "wasn't fair" that "a man who has lived for 40 years as a man and had children with a woman and enjoyed the services—the unpaid services of a wife, which most women will never know…then decides that the whole time he's been a woman".&lt;ref name="timegreer"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://time.com/4290409/germaine-greer-transgender-women/ |work=Time Magazine |title=Germaine Greer Defends Her Controversial Views on Transgender Women}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ideas have been met with criticism from believers in other branches of feminism. Sociologist Patricia Elliot argues that the view that one's socialization as a girl or woman defines "women's experience" assumes that cis women's experiences are homogeneous and discounts the possibility that trans and cis women may share the experience of being disparaged for their perceived femininity.&lt;ref name="Elliot_2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elliot |first1=Patricia |title=Who Gets to Be a Woman?: Feminist Politics and the Question of Trans-inclusion |journal=Atlantis: Critical Studies in Gender, Culture &amp; Social Justice |date=2004 |volume=29 |issue=1 |page=16 |url=http://journals.msvu.ca/index.php/atlantis/article/view/1166 |access-date=12 October 2018 |quote=The first assumption is that one's socialization as a girl or woman defines "women's experience" as something shared. But this assumption downplays differences among women, as if the sociological norms one identifies as part of a patriarchal gender order are evenly applied to all in one cookie-cutter model, or as if girls and women have the same relationships to those norms. It also fails to ask about possible similarities of experience between trans and non-trans women (both of whom may have been disparaged for their femininity). |archive-date=12 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181012214554/http://journals.msvu.ca/index.php/atlantis/article/view/1166 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that expectations of one's assigned sex are something enforced upon them, beginning at early socialization, and transgender youth, especially gender-nonconforming children, often experience different, worse treatment involving reprisals for their deviation therefrom.&lt;ref name="Dietert_Dentice"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dietert |first1=Michelle |last2=Dentice |first2=Dianne |title=Growing up trans: Socialization and the gender binary |journal=Journal of GLBT Family Studies |date=2012 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=24–42 |quote=When individuals deviate from gender binary arrangements by expressing gender norms and roles not associated with their biological assignment at birth, authorities submit control by utilizing gender binary discourse beginning in early socialization and lasting throughout the individual's life. During early socialization, we suggest that transgender individuals must negotiate their family and peer relationships relative to established, norm-driven gender binary discourse which oftentimes result in anxiety, fear of appraisals for not conforming to gender norms, and differential treatment from both family members and peers.|doi=10.1080/1550428X.2013.746053 |s2cid=143015502 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transfeminist [[Julia Serano]] has referred to implying that trans women may experience some degree of male privilege pre-transition as "denying [them] [[the closet]]", and has compared it to saying that a cisgender gay person experienced straight privilege before coming out. She has also compared it to if a cisgender girl was raised as a boy against her will, and how the two scenarios tend to be viewed differently by a cisgender audience, despite being ostensibly similar experiences from a transfeminine perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://juliaserano.medium.com/why-are-amab-trans-people-denied-the-closet-7fd5c740ce30 |title=Why are AMAB trans people denied the closet? |last1=Serano |first1=Julia |date=2 March 2022 |access-date=16 January 2023 |archive-date=16 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230116234350/https://juliaserano.medium.com/why-are-amab-trans-people-denied-the-closet-7fd5c740ce30 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender transition ===

In ''[[The Transsexual Empire]]'' (1979), feminist Janice Raymond denounces the act of transition as "rape", by virtue of "reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves".&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, Janice. (1994). ''The Transsexual Empire'', p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helen Joyce]] has described people who undergo transition, whether happier for it or not, as "a huge problem to a sane world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=PinkNews |url=https://www.thepinknews.com/2022/06/03/helen-joyce-transgender-lgbtq/ |title='Gender critical' author Helen Joyce says she wants to 'reduce' number of trans people: 'Chilling'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her own book ''[[Gyn/Ecology]]'' (1979), originally published one year earlier, [[Mary Daly]], who had served as Raymond's thesis supervisor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Feminist theologian Mary Daly dies|url=https://www.ebar.com/news///240420|access-date=3 July 2020|website=The Bay Area Reporter / B.A.R.

In a response to remarks by [[Elizabeth Grosz]], philosopher [[Eva Simone Hayward|Eva Hayward]] characterized this type of view as telling trans people who have had sex reassignment surgery: "Don't exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hayward |first1=Eva S. |title=Don't Exist |journal=[[Transgender Studies Quarterly]] |date=2017 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=191–194|doi=10.1215/23289252-3814985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intersex conditions===
Radical feminist [[Germaine Greer]] called women with XY [[Androgen insensitivity syndrome|AIS]] "men" and "incomplete males" in her 1999 book ''The Whole Woman''. [[Iain Morland]] responded that "in trying to criticize the social construction of femaleness and intersex, Greer disenfranchised precisely those people who live at the intersection of the two categories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Progress and Politics in the intersex rights movement, Feminist theory in action''|url=http://www.aisia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dreger__Herndon_2009.pdf|author1=Alice D.

Most intersex organizations subscribe to a mixed [[Social construction of gender|sociological perspective of sex and gender]], and as trans legislation and subjects overlaps heavily with intersex legislation, intersex people are often involved in [[trans activism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://interactadvocates.org/transgender-legislation-intersex/|title=Understanding How Anti-Transgender Legislation Also Affects Intersex Kids}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003206255-60/hermaphrodites-attitude-cheryl-chase|title=The Transgender Studies Reader Remix|first=Cheryl|last=Chase|chapter=Hermaphrodites with Attitude: Mapping the Emergence of Intersex Political Activism|date=14 July 2022|publisher=Routledge|doi=10.4324/9781003206255-60|isbn=9781003206255|access-date=14 July 2023|archive-date=28 August 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240828043411/https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003206255-60/hermaphrodites-attitude-cheryl-chase|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intersex women who display a mixed sexual [[phenotype]] often face [[Violence against transgender people|attacks similar to trans people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/most-state-bans-on-gender-affirming-care-for-trans-youth-still-allow-controversial-intersex-surgery|title=Most state bans on gender-affirming care for trans youth still allow controversial intersex surgery|date=23 March 2023|website=PBS NewsHour}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/10/26/us-anti-trans-bills-also-harm-intersex-children|title=US: Anti-Trans Bills Also Harm Intersex Children|date=26 October 2022|access-date=14 July 2023|archive-date=28 August 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240828040732/https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/10/26/us-anti-trans-bills-also-harm-intersex-children|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual orientation===

Gender critical feminists believe that transgender rights are a threat to the rights of gay people.&lt;ref name="Lamble"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lamble |first=Sarah |date=2024-05-23 |title=Confronting complex alliances: Situating Britain's gender critical politics within the wider transnational anti-gender movement |journal=Journal of Lesbian Studies |volume=28 |issue=3 |language=en |pages=504–517 |doi=10.1080/10894160.2024.2356496 |pmid=38783535 |issn=1089-4160|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender critical lesbians and feminists are a minority in the UK: polls show that cisgender lesbians and bisexual women are among the most trans-inclusive groups in Britain.&lt;ref name="Lamble"/&gt;

[[Kathleen Stock]], for instance, has said that allowing trans women to call themselves women "threatens a secure understanding of the concept 'lesbian{{' "}}.&lt;ref name="econ_stock" /&gt; [[Magdalen Berns]], co-founder of the group [[For Women Scotland]], has said that "there is no such thing as a lesbian with a penis" in regards to the idea of some trans women being lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=PinkNews |url=https://www.thepinknews.com/2019/06/25/jk-rowling-under-fire-following-transphobe-twitter/ |date=June 25, 2019 |title=JK Rowling under fire for following a 'proud transphobe' on Twitter |access-date=1 January 2024 |archive-date=28 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240828040810/https://www.thepinknews.com/2019/06/25/jk-rowling-under-fire-following-transphobe-twitter/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julie Bindel]] has said that transgender women cannot be lesbians, instead qualifying them as straight men trying to "join the club", and has compared transgender activism to men sexually assaulting lesbian women for rejecting their advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=The Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/10/13/trans-lesbians-women-men-bearded-united-nations/ |date=Oct 13, 2023 |title=No, United Nations.

Many other gender critical groups and pundits have spoken of the transgender rights movement as a men's sexual rights movement, designed to pressure lesbians into having sex with trans women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-57853385.amp |work= BBC |title= The lesbians who feel pressured to have sex and relationships with trans women |access-date= 4 January 2024 |archive-date= 28 August 2024 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20240828040736/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-57853385.amp |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work= Cosmopolitan|url= https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/love-sex/relationships/a28935330/terf-meaning/|title= What everyone needs to know about TERFs|date= 20 September 2019|access-date= 4 January 2024|archive-date= 28 August 2024|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20240828041238/https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/love-sex/relationships/a28935330/terf-meaning/|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=NBC |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna958456 |title='Pro-lesbian' or 'trans-exclusionary'?

[[Blanchard's transsexualism typology|Ray Blanchard's theory of autogynephilia]] is a recurrent talking point in TERF discourse, where it is usually presented as established science.

[[Janice Raymond]]'s ''[[The Transsexual Empire]]'', published in 1979, examined what she considered to be the role of transgender identity in reinforcing traditional gender stereotypes, in particular the ways in which the "medical-psychiatric complex" was medicalizing gender identity, and the social and political context that contributed to the image of gender-affirming treatment and surgery as therapeutic medicine.&lt;ref name="Raymond 1994"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-male | last=Raymond | first=Janice G. | publisher=Teachers College Press | location=New York | isbn=978-0807762721 | year=1994 | edition=2nd | url=https://janiceraymond.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/The%20Transsexual%20Empire.pdf | access-date=24 May 2019 | archive-date=8 November 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191108205024/http://janiceraymond.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/The%20Transsexual%20Empire.pdf | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond maintained that this was based in the "patriarchal myths" of "male mothering", and "making of woman according to man's image", and that transgender identity aimed "to colonize feminist identification, culture, politics and sexuality".&lt;ref name="Raymond 1994"/&gt; The book goes on to say that "All transsexuals [[rape]] women's bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact" and that "the problem of transsexualism would best be served by morally mandating it out of existence".&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, Janice.

Lee Hyun-Jae has noted that in the South Korean "[[feminism reboot]]" of the early 21st century, the radical stance of recent feminists have been "oriented in an [[identity politics]] based on [[biological sex]]", and that "the radical stance of today's [young] feminists has a tendency to emphasize the identity of the 'female body' as based on the category of the 'biological woman,' taking an attitude of excluding 'biological' men refugees, and transgender people".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Jinsook Kim has noted that "in Korean contexts, there have been increasing concerns over popular forms of feminism based on a strong female identity rooted in notions of biological sex, the pursuit of female-only and -first politics, and the refusal of solidarity with other social minority groups".&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kim |first=Jinsook |date=December 2021 |title=The Resurgence and Popularization of Feminism in South Korea: Key Issues and Challenges for Contemporary Feminist Activism |journal=[[Korea Journal]] |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=75–101 |doi=10.25024/kj.2021.61.4.75 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This proposed reform became a key locus of conflict for the emerging gender-critical movement, seeking to block reform of the Act, with a number of groups such as [[Fair Play For Women]], [[For Women Scotland]], and [[Woman's Place UK]] being formed. 2018 found a significant majority of respondents in favour of the GRA reforms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/response-to-the-gender-recognition-act-2004-consultation |title=Reform of the Gender Recognition Act — Analysis of consultation responses |first1=Daniel |last1=King |author2=Carrie Paechter |author3=Maranda Ridgway |publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]] |date=22 September 2020 |access-date=21 October 2021 |id=CP&amp;nbsp;294 |pages=8–9 |archive-date=5 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201005045042/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/response-to-the-gender-recognition-act-2004-consultation |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in 2020, [[Second Johnson ministry|Boris Johnson's government]] dropped the reforms, instead reducing the cost of a gender recognition certificate and moving the application process online.

Another key locus of conflict for the emerging movement was the stance of LGBT rights charity [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]] on trans issues. In 2015, Stonewall had begun campaigning for trans equality, with Stonewall head [[Ruth Hunt]] apologising for the organisation's previous failure to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gani|first1=Aisha|title=Stonewall to start campaigning for trans equality|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/16/stonewall-start-campaigning-trans-equality|access-date=31 May 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=16 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426042549/http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/16/stonewall-start-campaigning-trans-equality|archive-date=26 April 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2019, the [[LGB Alliance]] was founded in opposition to Stonewall, accusing the organization of having "undermined women's sex-based rights and protections" and attempting "to introduce confusion between biological sex and the notion of gender".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Hellen |first=Nicholas |date=22 September 2019 |title='Anti-women' trans policy may split Stonewall |work=The Sunday Times |location=London |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/anti-women-trans-policy-may-split-stonewall-wfv2rp5cx |access-date=13 February 2021 |archive-date=1 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210201130445/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/anti-women-trans-policy-may-split-stonewall-wfv2rp5cx |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 2019 saw the formation of the [[Women's Human Rights Campaign]] (now Women's Declaration International) by noted gender-critical feminist [[Sheila Jeffreys]] and co-founder Heather Brunskell-Evans. The group published a manifesto titled the ''Declaration on Women's Sex-Based Rights'', which argued that recognising trans women as women "constitutes discrimination against women" and called for the "elimination of that act".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MPs urged by anti-trans 'women's rights' group to eliminate 'transgenderism' and scrap Gender Recognition Act |url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/01/27/womens-human-rights-campaign-gender-recognition-act-inquiry-trans-transphobia/ |access-date=2 December 2021 |work=[[Pink News]] |archive-date=22 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220922041648/https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/01/27/womens-human-rights-campaign-gender-recognition-act-inquiry-trans-transphobia/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.womensdeclaration.com/en/declaration-womens-sex-based-rights-full-text/ | title=Declaration on Women's Sex-Based Rights: Full Text - Women's Declaration International | access-date=8 December 2021 | archive-date=7 December 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211207043837/https://womensdeclaration.com/en/declaration-womens-sex-based-rights-full-text/ | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Resolution 2417 (2022), the [[Council of Europe]] condemned "the highly prejudicial anti-gender, gender-critical and anti-trans narratives which reduce the fight for the equality of LGBTI people to what these movements deliberately mischaracterise as 'gender ideology' or 'LGBTI ideology'. Such narratives deny the very existence of LGBTI people, dehumanise them, and often falsely portray their rights as being in conflict with women's and children's rights, or societal and family values in general. All of these are deeply damaging to LGBTI people, while also harming women's and children's rights and social cohesion". The resolution further deplored "the extensive and often virulent attacks on the rights of LGBTI people that have been occurring for several years in, among other countries, Hungary, Poland, the Russian Federation, Turkey and the United Kingdom".&lt;ref name=Resolution2417&gt;{{cite web |title=Resolution 2417 (2022): Combating rising hate against LGBTI people in Europe |url=https://pace.coe.int/en/files/29712/html |date=25 January 2022 |publisher=[[Council of Europe]] |access-date=28 June 2023 |archive-date=19 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221119052750/https://pace.coe.int/en/files/29712/html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Duffy |first=Nick |date=25 January 2022 |title=Council of Europe condemns 'virulent attacks on LGBT rights' in the UK, Hungary and Poland |work=[[i (newspaper)|i]] |url=https://inews.co.uk/news/world/council-of-europe-condemns-virulent-attacks-on-lgbt-rights-uk-1423399 |access-date=30 January 2022 |archive-date=30 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220130182653/https://inews.co.uk/news/world/council-of-europe-condemns-virulent-attacks-on-lgbt-rights-uk-1423399 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Council of Europe compares UK to Russia and Poland over 'virulent attacks' on LGBT+ rights |url=https://www.thepinknews.com/2022/01/25/council-of-europe-uk-lgbt-trans-rights-russ-apoland/ |access-date=28 June 2023 |work=PinkNews |archive-date=30 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230530233726/https://www.thepinknews.com/2022/01/25/council-of-europe-uk-lgbt-trans-rights-russ-apoland/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "sex-based rights" is used, primarily in the UK, to refer to a variety of legal positions and political objectives, including:

* Existing exceptions defined in the UK [[Equality Act 2010]]. These exceptions do not grant any right for individuals to be offered single-sex services, but do allow service providers to offer such services, if they are "a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Attorney General affirms sex-based rights |url=https://womansplaceuk.org/2022/08/11/attorney-general-affirms-sex-based-rights/ |website=Woman's Place UK |date=11 August 2022 |access-date=17 August 2023 |archive-date=28 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240828042323/https://womansplaceuk.org/2022/08/11/attorney-general-affirms-sex-based-rights/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gender reassignment provisions in the Equality Act |url=https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/advice-and-guidance/gender-reassignment-provisions-equality-act |website=Equality and Human Rights Commission |access-date=11 September 2023 |archive-date=29 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230929192108/https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/advice-and-guidance/gender-reassignment-provisions-equality-act |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- unsourced, and seems redundant : Disagreements arise amongst feminists and trans-exclusionary feminists, as the inclusion/exclusion of transgender women polarizes both parties. There is debate if the inclusion of transgender women in feminism harvests a stronger and inclusive community, or if further oppresses cis-gender women. --&gt;

In May 2021 the case was found by the court to be unarguable, Justice Henshaw stating that "the claimant has shown no arguable reason to believe the Code has misled or will mislead service providers about their responsibilities under the Act".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=6 May 2021 |title=Judge throws out LGB Alliance founder's fight to ban trans women from women's spaces |url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/05/06/lgb-alliance-ann-sinnott-judicial-review-fails-london-high-court-equality-act/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221125215758/https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/05/06/lgb-alliance-ann-sinnott-judicial-review-fails-london-high-court-equality-act/ |archive-date=25 November 2022 |access-date=10 May 2021 |website=[[PinkNews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Forstater'' case has been used as a precedent for several claims of discrimination against people holding gender-critical views. Employment tribunals have delivered successful judgements in cases against [[Allison Bailey|a barrister's chambers]], [[Arts Council England]], [[Westminster City Council|Westminster Council]] and Social Work England. Claims against [[Girlguiding|Girlguiding UK]] and [[United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy]] ended in settlements, while a claim against the [[Department for Work and Pensions]] failed after the claimant was deemed to have gone too far by misgendering service users. The barrister Georgiana Calvert-Lee commented to the ''Guardian'': "Above all, in a pluralistic society, which is what we want, you have to accept that people are going to have different views."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Siddique |first1=Haroon |date=19 January 2024 |title=A politically toxic issue': the legal battles over gender-critical beliefs |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/19/a-politically-toxic-issue-the-legal-battles-over-gender-critical-beliefs |access-date=19 January 2023 |website=theguardian.com |publisher=Guardian |archive-date=28 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240828042827/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/19/a-politically-toxic-issue-the-legal-battles-over-gender-critical-beliefs |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2024, [[Jo Phoenix]] was successful in a claim against the [[Open University]] for discrimination on the grounds of gender-critical beliefs. The tribunal ruled that she had been constructively unfairly dismissed, and that she had suffered victimisation and harassment in the form of an open letter from 386 of her colleagues, as well as individual disparagement for her views, including one professor comparing her to "the racist uncle at the Christmas table".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Siddique |first1=Haroon |date=22 January 2024 |title=Open University academic wins tribunal case over gender-critical views |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/22/open-university-academic-wins-tribunal-case-over-gender-critical-views |access-date=24 January 2024 |website=theguardian.com |publisher=Guardian |archive-date=28 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240828042828/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/22/open-university-academic-wins-tribunal-case-over-gender-critical-views |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2024, [[Cambridgeshire County Council]] conceded that it had discriminated against Lizzie Pitt, a social worker, by initiating a disciplinary process against her following her gender-critical statements made at an LGBT support group.

In August 2024, a private settlement was reached between the Metanoia Institute and student psychotherapist James Esses. In a statement released following the settlement, the Metanoia Institute stated that it failed to follow its processes in not affording Esses a hearing prior to his expulsion after he expressed his gender-critical views and campaigned against a proposed ban on [[conversion therapy]].

=== United States ===
Although gender-critical feminism originated in the United States in the 1970s, it has largely fallen out of favor among American feminists.&lt;ref name="Burns 2019"/&gt; Some gender-critical organizations do remain, however, such as [[WoLF]], a gender-critical feminist organization that operates mainly within the United States.&lt;ref name="Burns 2019" /&gt;

== Analysis ==

=== Scholarly analysis ===
[[Lesbian studies]] scholars Carly Thomsen and Laurie Essig note that "transness has been and is the object of deep hostility within some marginalized forms of feminism. Skepticism among earlier anti-trans feminists, such as Janice Raymond, about trans women being "real" women has morphed into J.K. Rowling's Twitter feed where she has insisted that trans women are not women. These ideas are, of course, deplorable, but they are also quite fringe within feminist studies and activism in the US".&lt;ref name=Thomsen&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thomsen |first1=Carly |last2=Essig |first2=Laurie |title=Lesbian, feminist, TERF: a queer attack on feminist studies |journal=[[Journal of Lesbian Studies]] |date=2021 |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=27–44 |doi=10.1080/10894160.2021.1950270|pmid=34313195 |s2cid=236452285 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clair Thurlow notes that the more explicitly hateful language used by early trans-exclusionary radical feminists failed to gain support, forcing them to pivot towards euphemisms and [[dog-whistle politics|dog-whistle]]s such as using "pro-woman" to mean "anti-trans", "protecting sex-based rights" meant excluding trans people, and "trans-exclusionary radical feminism" became "gender-critical feminism". This allowed trans-exclusionary feminism to appear reasonable to the average person while maintaining their anti-trans meanings to other anti-trans activists.&lt;ref name=Thurlow/&gt;

Gender studies scholars Serena Bassi and Greta LaFleur have noted that TERFism started out as a fringe group among English speaking [[cultural feminism|cultural feminists]] in the 1970s that grew rapidly due to media exposure.&lt;ref name=Bassi&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bassi |first1=Serena |last2=LaFleur |first2=Greta |title=Introduction: TERFs, Gender-Critical Movements, and Postfascist Feminisms |journal=[[Transgender Studies Quarterly]] |date=2022 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=311–333 |doi=10.1215/23289252-9836008|s2cid=253052875 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cristan Williams notes that radical feminism has historically been predominantly trans-inclusive and considers trans-exclusionary views a minority or fringe view within radical feminism.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=Cristan |title=Radical Inclusion: Recounting the Trans Inclusive History of Radical Feminism |journal=Transgender Studies Quarterly |date=2016 |volume=3 |issue=1–2 |pages=254–258 |doi=10.1215/23289252-3334463|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrera-Fernández and DePalma argued that "the increasingly belligerent popular discourses promoted by TERF groups since the 1970s [are] appropriating feminist discourses to produce arguments that contradict basic premises of feminism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carrera-Fernández |first1=María Victoria |last2=DePalma |first2=Renée |title=Feminism will be trans-inclusive or it will not be: Why do two cis-hetero woman educators support transfeminism? |journal=[[The Sociological Review]] |date=2020 |volume=68 |issue=4 |pages=745–762 |doi=10.1177/0038026120934686|s2cid=221097541 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry F. Fradella]] said that most contemporary feminists are supportive of trans people, and that gender-critical feminists are a small but vocal group who believe that trans rights threaten the rights of cis women. Most gender-critical arguments for this belief, he says, are false, and "misconstrue or ignore empirical data from both the natural and social sciences". Gender-critical feminism risks legal equality and contributes to criminalization of trans people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fradella |first1=Henry F.|author-link=Henry F.

In July 2018, [[Sally Hines]], a [[University of Leeds]] professor of sociology and gender studies scholar, wrote in ''[[The Economist]]'' that feminism and trans rights have been falsely portrayed as being in conflict by a minority of anti-transgender feminists, who often "reinforce the extremely offensive trope of the trans woman as a man in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] who is a danger to women". Hines criticized these feminists for fueling "rhetoric of paranoia and hyperbole" against trans people, saying that they abandon or undermine feminist principles in their anti-trans narratives, such as [[bodily autonomy]] and self-determination of gender, and employ "reductive models of biology and restrictive understandings of the distinction between sex and gender" in defense of such narratives. She concluded with a call for explicit recognition of anti-transgender feminism as a violation of equality and dignity, and "a doctrine that runs counter to the ability to fulfill a liveable life or, often, a life at all".&lt;ref name="Hines 2018"&gt;{{cite news |date=13 July 2018 |title=Trans and Feminist Rights Have Been Falsely Cast in Opposition |newspaper=The Economist |url=https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/07/13/trans-and-feminist-rights-have-been-falsely-cast-in-opposition |url-status=live |access-date=2 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502004748/https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/07/13/trans-and-feminist-rights-have-been-falsely-cast-in-opposition |archive-date=2 May 2019 |author-first1=Sally |author-last1=Hines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Briar Dickey notes that "British 'trans-exclusionary radical feminist' (TERF) discourse has often been contextualised in fringe radical feminist thought", and argues that "the contextualisation of contemporary TERF discourse as an extension and evolution of fringe second-wave feminism [...] neglects its relationship to a wider international wave of anti-transgender sentiment" anchored in conservative and religious movements.&lt;ref name=BD&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dickey |first1=Briar |title=Transphobic Truth Markets: Comparing Trans-hostile Discourses in British Trans-exclusionary Radical Feminist and US Right-wing Movements |journal=Journal of Diversity and Gender Studies |date=2023 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=34–47 |doi=10.21825/digest.85311|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher Aleardo Zanghellini argues that "gender-critical feminism advocates reserving women's spaces for [[Cisgender|cis]] women" as well as that "Many problems in gender-critical thought are consistent with the explanation that paranoid structuralism is too often presupposed in gender-critical work".&lt;ref name="Zanghellini 14"/&gt;

[[Mauro Cabral Grinspan]], Ilana Eloit, [[David Paternotte]] and [[Mieke Verloo]] dislike the expression "gender-critical feminism", saying that it allows trans-exclusionary feminists to rebrand transphobic activism.&lt;ref name=Grinspan/&gt;

Abbie E. Goldberg argues that "trans-exclusionary radical feminism (TERF) has contained similar [[Cisnormativity|cisnormative]] arguments to those of social conservatives, promoting vilification of people with a trans lived experience in the guise of so-called gender-critical feminism" and that "this TERF approach has been used to promote exclusionary and discriminatory legislation, such as prohibiting equal access to public toilets and the right to be treated in accordance with one's gender in workplaces, accommodations, and public venues".&lt;ref name="Goldberg"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goldberg |first1=Abbie E. |title=The Sage Encyclopedia of LGBTQ+ Studies |date=2024 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |isbn=9781071891384 |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2024}}

=== Relationship with the anti-gender movement ===
{{further|Anti-gender movement}}
Bassi and LaFleur write that "the trans-exclusionary feminist (TERF) movement and the so-called anti-gender movement are only rarely distinguished as movements with distinct constitutions and aims".&lt;ref name=Bassi/&gt; Pearce et al. note that the concept of "[[gender ideology]]" "saw increasing circulation in [[TERF|trans-exclusionary radical feminist]] discourse" from around 2016.&lt;ref name=Pearce/&gt; Claire House noted in 2023 that "key streams within trans exclusionary women's and feminist movements increasingly engage in collaborative action with right-wing populist-centered anti-gender coalitions, which include right-wing religious, conservative, and right-wing extremist actors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=House |first1=Claire |title='I'm Real, Not You': Roles and Discourses of Trans Exclusionary Women's and Feminist Movements in Anti-gender and Right-wing Populist Politics |journal=Journal of Diversity and Gender Studies |date=2023 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=14–32 |doi=10.21825/digest.85755 |url=https://www.digest.ugent.be/article/id/85755/ |doi-access=free |access-date=1 February 2024 |archive-date=1 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240201011620/https://www.digest.ugent.be/article/id/85755/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Claire Thurlow writes that "despite efforts to obscure the point, gender critical feminism continues to rely on transphobic tropes, moral panics and essentialist understandings of men and women. These factors also continue to link trans-exclusionary feminism to anti-feminist reactionary politics and other 'anti-gender' movements".&lt;ref name=Thurlow&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thurlow |first1=Claire |title=From TERF to gender critical: A telling genealogy? |journal=[[Sexualities (journal)|Sexualities]] |date=2022 |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=962–978 |doi=10.1177/13634607221107827|s2cid=252662057 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UN Women]] has described the gender-critical, anti-gender and [[men's rights movement]]s as [[anti-rights movements]] that overlap in opposition to what they describe as "gender ideology", which the agency described as "a term used to oppose the concept of gender, women's rights, and the rights of LGBTIQ+ people broadly." They argued these groups have attempted to "frame equality for women and LGBTIQ+ people as a threat to so-called 'traditional' family values" and linked them to "hateful propaganda and disinformation to target and attempt to delegitimize people with diverse sexual orientations, gender identities, gender expressions, and sex characteristics."&lt;ref name=unwomen&gt;{{cite web |title=LGBTIQ+ communities and the anti-rights pushback: 5 things to know |date=28 May 2024 |url=https://www.unwomen.org/en/news-stories/explainer/2024/05/lgbtiq-communities-and-the-anti-rights-pushback-5-things-to-know |publisher=[[UN Women]] |access-date=15 June 2024 |archive-date=28 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240628133729/https://www.unwomen.org/en/news-stories/explainer/2024/05/lgbtiq-communities-and-the-anti-rights-pushback-5-things-to-know |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thetimesantirights&gt;{{cite news |title=UN Women says gender-critical activists are 'anti-rights movement' |url=https://www.thetimes.com/uk/society/article/un-women-says-gender-critical-activists-are-anti-rights-movement-b5mk7h9qr |access-date=16 June 2024 |work=The Times |archive-date=16 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240616192500/https://www.thetimes.com/uk/society/article/un-women-says-gender-critical-activists-are-anti-rights-movement-b5mk7h9qr |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2019, [[The Heritage Foundation]], an American conservative think tank, hosted a panel of self-described radical feminists opposed to the US [[Equality Act (United States)|Equality Act]].&lt;ref name="nbcnews_2019-01-29" /&gt; Heron Greenesmith of [[Political Research Associates]], an American liberal think tank, has said that the latest iteration of collaboration between conservatives and anti-transgender feminists is in part a reaction to the trans community's "incredible gains" in civil rights and visibility, and that anti-trans feminists and conservatives capitalize on a "scarcity mindset rhetoric" whereby civil rights are portrayed as a limited commodity and must be prioritized to cisgender women over other groups. Greenesmith compared this rhetoric to the right-wing tactic of prioritizing the rights of citizens over non-citizens and white people over people of colour.&lt;ref name="nbcnews_2019-01-29" /&gt; Bev Jackson, one of the founders of the [[LGB Alliance]], has argued in contrast that "working with The Heritage Foundation is sometimes the only possible course of action" since "the leftwing silence on gender in the US is even worse than in the UK".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=21 August 2020 |title=LGB Alliance founder defends "feminists" working with Heritage Foundation |url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/08/21/lgb-alliance-founder-bev-jackson-heritage-foundation-tweets/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210603012155/https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/08/21/lgb-alliance-founder-bev-jackson-heritage-foundation-tweets/ |archive-date=3 June 2021 |access-date=7 December 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2020 article in ''[[Lambda Nordica]]'', [[Erika Alm]] of the [[University of Gothenburg]] and [[Elisabeth L.

It further said that "a growing number of anti-trans campaigners associated with radical feminist movements have openly aligned themselves with anti-feminist organisations".&lt;ref name="Pearce" /&gt;

In a 2021 paper in ''[[Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society]]'', Hil Malatino of [[Pennsylvania State University]] said that "'gender-critical' feminism" in the US has "begun to build coalition with the evangelical Right around the legal codification of sex as a biological binary" and that "popular news media frames transphobia as part of a rational, enlightened, pragmatic response to what is variously called the 'trans lobby' and the 'cult of trans'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Malatino |first1=Hil |year=2021 |title=The Promise of Repair: Trans Rage and the Limits of Feminist Coalition |url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/713292?journalCode=signs |url-status=live |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=827–851 |doi=10.1086/713292 |s2cid=235304979 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211030181558/https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/713292?journalCode=signs |archive-date=30 October 2021 |access-date=7 December 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2021 paper, in ''[[Law and Social Inquiry]]'', said that "a coalition of Christian conservative legal organizations, conservative foundations, Trump administration officials, Republican party lawmakers, and trans-exclusionary radical feminists has assembled to redefine the right to privacy in service of anti-transgender politics" and that "social conservatives have cast the issue as one of balancing two competing rights claims rather than one of outright animus against a gender minority population".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wuest |first1=Joanna |year=2021 |title=A Conservative Right to Privacy: Legal, Ideological, and Coalitional Transformations in US Social Conservatism |journal=Law &amp; Social Inquiry |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=964–992 |doi=10.1017/lsi.2021.1 |s2cid=234808832 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Misinformation and disinformation ===
T.J. Billiard in article on "TERF strategies" has stated that "[[misinformation]]—or, more specifically, [[disinformation]]—about trans topics has become the defining feature of public discourse on transgender rights".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cilia Williams et al. noted in an article on gender critical feminist discourse in Spain that "anti-trans  narratives  online [...] use  attacks,  misinformation,  and  self-defence  as  a  communication  strategy,  rather  than  debate  or  dialogue".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Alyosxa Tudor has written that "strategic disinformation as [an] accelerator" has been used to push forward "hateful and anti-democratic agendas".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Controversies ==

=== Academic freedom ===
Conflict between gender-critical feminists and other feminists and transgender rights activists has resulted in controversies in which the principles of academic freedom have been invoked. Conflicts have erupted at university campuses.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

Kathleen Lowrey, who had allegedly been fired from her additional position as associate chair of undergraduate programs for the department of anthropology at the [[University of Alberta]] after displaying gender-critical posters on her office door, teaching gender-critical material in class, and showing up halfway through a student-run queer anthology event to start arguments about "the existence and validity of trans people with a trans man in the room",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://thegatewayonline.ca/2020/06/professor-lowrey-dismayed-over-dismissal-from-admin-role/ | title=Professor Lowrey dismayed over dismissal from admin role; others feel it is a positive step | date=11 June 2020 | access-date=8 December 2021 | archive-date=8 December 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211208170803/https://thegatewayonline.ca/2020/06/professor-lowrey-dismayed-over-dismissal-from-admin-role/ | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/u-of-a-professor-says-she-was-dismissed-over-views-that-biological-sex-trumps-transgender-identity-for-policy-decisions/ | title=U of a professor says she was dismissed over views that biological sex trumps transgender identity for policy decisions | access-date=8 December 2021 | archive-date=8 December 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211208170801/https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/u-of-a-professor-says-she-was-dismissed-over-views-that-biological-sex-trumps-transgender-identity-for-policy-decisions/ | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; published a paper in ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]'' saying that she found it particularly distressing that "almost all of my most enthusiastic public attackers were feminist academic women" and that gender-critical feminists "root their analysis in the materiality of biological sex and take the oppression of women to be linked to the control of reproduction. In the present scholarly ecumene, this aligns them in some respects with scholars who are traditional and conservative, and explains why they, like conservatives, are so often in trouble with their institutions under present conditions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/s10508-021-01950-9 | title=Trans Ideology and the New Ptolemaism in the Academy | year=2021 | last1=Lowrey | first1=Kathleen | journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume=50 | issue=3 | pages=757–760 | pmid=33660161 | s2cid=232112514 | doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carolyn Sale of the Center for Free Expression at Ryerson University condemned the university's decision, saying that "the idea that in a hush behind closed doors students can bring complaints that don't have to be proven true and can do so in order to protect their "safety" should alarm us all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://cfe.ryerson.ca/blog/2020/06/academic-freedom-and-perceptions-harm | title=Academic Freedom and Perceptions of Harm &amp;#124; Centre for Free Expression | access-date=8 December 2021 | archive-date=8 December 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211208170812/https://cfe.ryerson.ca/blog/2020/06/academic-freedom-and-perceptions-harm | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2022, Laura Favaro published an article in ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' discussing her research into the climate of the debate among academics. Noting that she had interviewed 50 feminist academics in gender studies with a range of views on the subject, Favaro stated "my discussions left me in no doubt that a culture of discrimination, silencing and fear has taken hold across universities in England, and many countries beyond".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Favaro |first=Laura |date=15 September 2022 |title=Researchers are wounded in academia's gender wars |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/depth/researchers-are-wounded-academias-gender-wars |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220916233729/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/depth/researchers-are-wounded-academias-gender-wars |archive-date=16 September 2022 |access-date=4 October 2023 |website=Times Higher Education (THE) |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Favaro later began discrimination proceedings against [[City, University of London]], stating she had been "ostracised at her workplace and denied access to her research data" after the publication of her article.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Somerville |first=Ewan |date=15 April 2023 |title=University 'blocks' academic from her own gender wars research over 'dangerous' data |language=en-GB |work=The Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/04/15/university-blocks-academic-gender-wars-research/ |access-date=4 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230508091117/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/04/15/university-blocks-academic-gender-wars-research/ |archive-date=8 May 2023 |issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web |date=30 August 2023 |title=Laura Favaro: gender studies 'groupthink is forcing scholars out' |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/laura-favaro-gender-studies-groupthink-forcing-scholars-out |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230830174319/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/laura-favaro-gender-studies-groupthink-forcing-scholars-out |archive-date=30 August 2023 |access-date=4 October 2023 |website=Times Higher Education (THE) |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

City, University of London responded with a statement that it had a "legal obligation to protect freedom of expression that we take very seriously". It also took its "obligations with respect to ethics and integrity very seriously" and made clear that "any personal data processed in the course of any research [should be] processed in compliance with data protection legislation".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Conflicts with other feminist and pro-equality groups ===
In February 2020, 28 feminist and LGBT groups in France co-signed a declaration titled ''Toutes des femmes'' denouncing trans-exclusionary feminism, saying that "questions disguised as 'legitimate concerns' quickly give way to more violent attacks" and that "it is a confusionist and conspiratorial ideological movement using the cover of feminism to disrupt real feminist fights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.liberation.fr/debats/2020/02/26/le-debat-sur-la-place-des-femmes-trans-n-a-pas-lieu-d-etre_1779708/ | title=Le débat sur la place des femmes trans n'a pas lieu d'être | access-date=8 December 2021 | archive-date=17 May 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210517001126/https://www.liberation.fr/debats/2020/02/26/le-debat-sur-la-place-des-femmes-trans-n-a-pas-lieu-d-etre_1779708/ | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration has since also been signed by over 100 additional feminist, LGBT, and progressive groups.&lt;ref name="Toutes des femmes"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://toutesdesfemmes.fr/signataires/ | title=Les signataires - Toutes des Femmes | date=25 February 2020 | access-date=8 December 2021 | archive-date=8 December 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211208170603/https://toutesdesfemmes.fr/signataires/ | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2021, over 110 women's and human rights organisations in Canada signed a statement stating that they "vehemently reject the dangerous and bigoted rhetoric and ideology espoused by Trans Exclusionary Radical 'Feminists' (TERFs)", and saying that "trans people are a driving force in our feminist movements and make incredible contributions across all facets of our society".&lt;ref name="Canada 110"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.actioncanadashr.org/news/2021-05-04-our-feminism-trans-inclusive|title=Our Feminism is Trans Inclusive. &amp;#124; Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights|access-date=8 December 2021|archive-date=12 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210612151421/https://www.actioncanadashr.org/news/2021-05-04-our-feminism-trans-inclusive|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judith Butler]] said in 2020 that trans-exclusionary radical feminism is "a fringe movement that is seeking to speak in the name of the mainstream, and that our responsibility is to refuse to let that happen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Judith Butler on the culture wars, JK Rowling and living in "anti-intellectual times" |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/uncategorized/2020/09/judith-butler-culture-wars-jk-rowling-and-living-anti-intellectual-times |access-date=17 November 2021 |work=New Statesman |archive-date=17 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220417111403/https://www.newstatesman.com/uncategorized/2020/09/judith-butler-culture-wars-jk-rowling-and-living-anti-intellectual-times |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2021, the [[Council of Europe]] Committee on Equality and Non-Discrimination published a report titled ''Combating rising hate against LGBTI people in Europe'', which condemned "the highly prejudicial anti-gender, gender-critical and anti-trans narratives which reduce the fight for the equality of LGBTI people to what these movements deliberately mischaracterise as '[[gender ideology]]' or '[[LGBT "ideology"|LGBTI ideology]]'" and which said there was "a direct link between heteronormativity and heterosexism, on the one hand, and the growing anti-gender and gender-critical movements".&lt;ref name="Council of Europe 2021"&gt;{{citation |url=https://assembly.coe.int/LifeRay/EGA/Pdf/TextesProvisoires/2021/20210921-RisingHateLGBTI-EN.pdf |title=Combating rising hate against LGBTI people in Europe (Provisional version) |first=Fourat |last=Ben Chika |publisher=[[Council of Europe]] Committee on Equality and Non-Discrimination |date=21 September 2021 |access-date=8 December 2021 |archive-date=23 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210923211038/https://assembly.coe.int/LifeRay/EGA/Pdf/TextesProvisoires/2021/20210921-RisingHateLGBTI-EN.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report formed the basis of Resolution 2417, adopted in January 2022.&lt;ref name=Resolution2417/&gt;

In late-January 2018, over 1000 Irish feminists, including several groups such as the [[University College Dublin]] Centre of Gender, Feminisms &amp; Sexualities, signed an open letter condemning a planned meeting in Ireland on UK Gender Recognition Act reforms organised by a British group opposing the reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://gcn.ie/ireland-says-no-to-terfs/ | title=Ireland Says No to TERFs | date=24 January 2018 | access-date=8 December 2021 | archive-date=24 February 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220224001108/https://gcn.ie/ireland-says-no-to-terfs/ | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter stated that "[t]rans people and particularly trans women are an inextricable part of our feminist community" and accused the British group of colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.irishcentral.com/news/irish-feminists-warn-away-british-terfs|title = "Stay away from Ireland," British anti-trans feminists told|date = 23 January 2018|access-date = 8 December 2021|archive-date = 1 December 2021|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211201205946/https://www.irishcentral.com/news/irish-feminists-warn-away-british-terfs|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist Kelsy Burke argued that "TERFs aren't aligned with most feminists" and wrote that "most American feminists are far from trans-exclusionary and have long been among the most supportive groups of LGBTQ equality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Burke |first1=Kelsy |title=Feminists have long supported trans rights |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/made-by-history/2023/07/27/trans-rights-feminism-conservative-women/ |access-date=18 March 2024 |newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social media ===
The controversial Reddit community [[Controversial Reddit communities#GenderCritical|r/GenderCritical]] gathered a reputation as an anti-trans space. In June 2020, it was banned abruptly for violating new rules against "promoting hate". Members set up a similar community called Ovarit.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web |date=2023-04-28 |title=TERFs and The Donald: The Future of Reddit's Banned Groups - The Atlantic |website=[[The Atlantic]] |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/12/reddit-ovarit-the-donald/617320/ |access-date=2023-10-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230428050258/https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/12/reddit-ovarit-the-donald/617320/ |archive-date=28 April 2023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
