== Terminology ==

=== Sex and gender ===

Gender-critical feminists equate "women" with what they consider to be a "female sex class", and view historical and contemporary oppression of women as being rooted in their being female, while "gender" is a system of social norms which functions to oppress women on the basis of their sex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Woman as Resource: A Reply to Catharine MacKinnon - The Philosophers' Magazine |url=https://www.philosophersmag.com/essays/318-woman-as-resource-a-reply-to-catharine-mackinnon |access-date=21 October 2023 |website=www.philosophersmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kodsi |first1=Daniel |title=Who is feminism for? |date=3 July 2022 |url=https://thecritic.co.uk/who-is-feminism-for/ |access-date=14 August 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe sex is biological and cannot be changed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brione |first1=Patrick |title=Employment Tribunal rulings on gender-critical beliefs in the workplace |url=https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/employment-tribunal-rulings-on-gender-critical-beliefs-in-the-workplace |access-date=14 August 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that biological sex should be a protected characteristic under equality legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Elgot |first1=Jessica |title=Kemi Badenoch could rewrite law to allow trans exclusion from single-sex spaces |url=https://amp.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/04/kemi-badenoch-could-rewrite-law-to-allow-trans-exclusion-from-single-sex-spaces |access-date=14 August 2023 |work=The Guardian |date=4 April 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, gender critics emphasise the view that sex is binary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cowan |first1=Sharon |last2=Morris |first2=Sean |title=Should 'Gender Critical' Views about Trans People Be Protected as Philosophical Beliefs in the Workplace?

In gender-critical discourse, the terms ''man'' and ''woman'' are used as sex-terms, assigned no more meaning than ''adult human male'' and ''adult human female'' respectively, in contrast to feminist theorists who argue these terms embody a social category distinct from matters of biology (usually referred to as ''gender''), with ''masculinity'' and ''femininity'' representing normative characteristics thereof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-gender/#SexDis |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=15 August 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Byrne |first1=Alex |title=Are women adult human females? |journal=Philosophical Studies |date=January 2020 |volume=177 |issue=12 |page=22 |doi=10.1007/s11098-019-01408-8 |hdl=1721.1/128358 |s2cid=254943344 |url=https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/128358/11098_2019_1408_ReferencePDF.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''adult human female'' has become a [[slogan]] in gender-critical politics, and has been described as transphobic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woman billboard removed after transphobia row |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45650462 |access-date=15 August 2023 |work=BBC News |date=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex-based rights ===

Gender critical feminists advocate for what they call "sex-based rights," arguing that "women's human rights are based upon sex" and that "these rights are being eroded by the promotion of 'gender identity.'"&lt;ref name=HinesSocRev&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hines |first1=Sally |title=Sex wars and (trans) gender panics: Identity and body politics in contemporary UK feminism |journal=[[The Sociological Review]] |date=2020 |volume=68 |issue=4 |pages=699–717 |doi=10.1177/0038026120934684 |s2cid=221097483 |url=https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/163972/8/0038026120934684.pdf |access-date=16 June 2023 |archive-date=14 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211214191345/https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/163972/8/0038026120934684.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used, primarily in the UK, to refer to a variety of legal positions and political objectives, including:

* Existing exceptions defined in the UK [[Equality Act 2010]]. These exceptions do not grant any right for individuals to be offered single-sex services, but do allow service providers to offer such services, if they are “a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Attorney General affirms sex-based rights |url=https://womansplaceuk.org/2022/08/11/attorney-general-affirms-sex-based-rights/ |website=Woman's Place UK |date=11 August 2022 |access-date=17 August 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gender reassignment provisions in the Equality Act |url=https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/advice-and-guidance/gender-reassignment-provisions-equality-act |website=Equality and Human Rights Commission |access-date=11 September 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gender-critical movement argues that recognition of transgender women as women conflicts with these rights.&lt;ref name="trans_inclusive_criminology"&gt;|9={{cite journal | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10612-021-09590-0 | doi=10.1007/s10612-021-09590-0 | title=Building an Intersectional and Trans-Inclusive Criminology: Responding to the Emergence of "Gender Critical" Perspectives in Feminist Criminology | year=2021 | last1=Valcore | first1=Jace | last2=Fradella | first2=Henry F. | last3=Guadalupe-Diaz | first3=Xavier | last4=Ball | first4=Matthew J. | last5=Dwyer | first5=Angela | last6=Dejong | first6=Christina | last7=Walker | first7=Allyn | last8=Wodda | first8=Aimee | last9=Worthen | first9=Meredith G.

Human rights scholar Sandra Duffy described the concept of "sex-based rights" as "a fiction with the pretense of legality," noting that "[[international human rights law]] is not static or originalist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Duffy |first1=Sandra |title=An International Human Rights Law Analysis of the WHRC Declaration |date=26 October 2021 |url=https://sandraduffy.wordpress.com/2021/10/26/an-international-human-rights-law-analysis-of-the-whrc-declaration/ |access-date=4 December 2021 |archive-date=16 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220616105029/https://sandraduffy.wordpress.com/2021/10/26/an-international-human-rights-law-analysis-of-the-whrc-declaration/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catharine A. MacKinnon]] noted that "the recognition [that discrimination against trans people is discrimination on the basis of sex, that is gender, the social meaning of sex] does not, contrary to allegations of anti-trans self-identified feminists, endanger women or feminism, including what some in this group call 'women's sex-based rights.' To begin with, women—in the United States anyway—do not have 'sex-based rights' in the affirmative sense some in this group seem to think."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacKinnon |first1=Catharine A.|author-link= Catharine A.

=== Socialisation and gender nonconformity ===

Radical feminists generally see gender as a system in which women are oppressed for reasons intrinsically related to their sex, and emphasize male violence against women, particularly involving institutions such as the [[sex industry]], as central to women's oppression.&lt;ref name="McKay 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mackay |first1=Finn |title=Radical Feminism |journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society |date=December 2015 |volume=32 |issue=7–8 |pages=332–336 |doi=10.1177/0263276415616682 |s2cid=220719287 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bettcher |first1=Talia Mae |editor1-last=Disch |editor1-first=Lisa |editor2-last=Hawkesworth |editor2-first=Mary |title=The Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theory |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199328581 |pages=407–427 |chapter=Intersexuality, transgender and transsexuality|year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intersex women===
Radical feminist [[Germaine Greer]] called women with XY [[Androgen insensitivity syndrome|AIS]] "men" and "incomplete males" in her 1999 book ''The Whole Woman''. [[Iain Morland]] responded that "in trying to criticize the social construction of femaleness and intersex, Greer disenfranchised precisely those people who live at the intersection of the two categories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Progress and Politics in the intersex rights movement, Feminist theory in action''|url=http://www.aisia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dreger__Herndon_2009.pdf|author1=Alice D.

[[Janice Raymond]]'s ''[[The Transsexual Empire]]'', published in 1979, purported to examine the role of transgender identity in reinforcing traditional gender stereotypes, in particular the ways in which the "medical-psychiatric complex" was medicalizing gender identity, and the social and political context that contributed to the image of gender-affirming treatment and surgery as therapeutic medicine.&lt;ref name="Raymond 1994"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-male | last=Raymond | first=Janice G. | publisher=Teachers College Press | location=New York | isbn=978-0807762721 | year=1994 | edition=2nd | url=https://janiceraymond.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/The%20Transsexual%20Empire.pdf | access-date=24 May 2019 | archive-date=8 November 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191108205024/http://janiceraymond.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/The%20Transsexual%20Empire.pdf | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond maintained that this was based in the "patriarchal myths" of "male mothering", and "making of woman according to man's image", and that transgender identity aimed "to colonize feminist identification, culture, politics and sexuality."&lt;ref name="Raymond 1994"/&gt; The book goes on to say that “All transsexuals [[rape]] women's bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact” and that “the problem of transsexualism would best be served by morally mandating it out of existence“. &lt;ref&gt;Raymond, Janice.

&lt;!-- More detail and more sources about the early history would be nice --&gt;

In 2016, the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]' [[Women and Equalities Committee]] issued a report recommending that the [[Gender Recognition Act 2004]] be updated "in line with the principles of [[gender self-declaration]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmselect/cmwomeq/390/39010.htm#_idTextAnchor213|title=Transgender Equality|last1=Women and Equalities Committee|date=8 January 2016|publisher=House of Commons|quote=Within the current Parliament, the Government must bring forward proposals to update the Gender Recognition Act, in line with the principles of gender self-declaration that have been developed in other jurisdictions.

This proposed reform became a key locus of conflict for the emerging gender-critical movement, seeking to block reform of the Act, with a number of groups such as [[Fair Play For Women]], [[For Women Scotland]], and [[Woman's Place UK]] being formed. 2018 found a significant majority of respondents in favour of the GRA reforms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/response-to-the-gender-recognition-act-2004-consultation |title=Reform of the Gender Recognition Act — Analysis of consultation responses |first1=Daniel |last1=King |author2=Carrie Paechter |author3=Maranda Ridgway |publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]] |date=22 September 2020 |access-date=21 October 2021 |id=CP&amp;nbsp;294 |pages=8–9 |archive-date=5 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201005045042/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/response-to-the-gender-recognition-act-2004-consultation |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in 2020, [[Second Johnson ministry|Boris Johnson's government]] dropped the reforms, instead reducing the cost of a gender recognition certificate and moving the application process online.

Another key locus of conflict for the emerging movement was the stance of LGBT rights charity [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]] on trans issues. In 2015, Stonewall had begun campaigning for trans equality, with Stonewall head [[Ruth Hunt]] apologising for the organisation's previous failure to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gani|first1=Aisha|title=Stonewall to start campaigning for trans equality|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/16/stonewall-start-campaigning-trans-equality|access-date=31 May 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=16 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426042549/http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/16/stonewall-start-campaigning-trans-equality|archive-date=26 April 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2019, the [[LGB Alliance]] was founded in opposition to Stonewall, accusing the organization of having "undermined women's sex-based rights and protections" and attempting "to introduce confusion between biological sex and the notion of gender."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Hellen |first=Nicholas |date=22 September 2019 |title='Anti-women' trans policy may split Stonewall |work=The Sunday Times |location=London |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/anti-women-trans-policy-may-split-stonewall-wfv2rp5cx |access-date=13 February 2021 |archive-date=1 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210201130445/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/anti-women-trans-policy-may-split-stonewall-wfv2rp5cx |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2019 saw the formation of the [[Women's Human Rights Campaign]] (now Women's Declaration International) by noted gender-critical feminist [[Sheila Jeffreys]] and co-founder Heather Brunskell-Evans. The group published a manifesto titled the ''Declaration on Women's Sex-Based Rights'', which argued that recognising trans women as women "constitutes discrimination against women" and called for the "elimination of that act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MPs urged by anti-trans 'women's rights' group to eliminate 'transgenderism' and scrap Gender Recognition Act |url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/01/27/womens-human-rights-campaign-gender-recognition-act-inquiry-trans-transphobia/ |access-date=2 December 2021 |work=[[Pink News]] |archive-date=22 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220922041648/https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/01/27/womens-human-rights-campaign-gender-recognition-act-inquiry-trans-transphobia/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.womensdeclaration.com/en/declaration-womens-sex-based-rights-full-text/ | title=Declaration on Women's Sex-Based Rights: Full Text - Women's Declaration International | access-date=8 December 2021 | archive-date=7 December 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211207043837/https://womensdeclaration.com/en/declaration-womens-sex-based-rights-full-text/ | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2019 also saw the preliminary hearings of ''[[Maya Forstater v Centre for Global Development]]'', in which tax expert and researcher Maya Forstater made a claim that she had been discriminated against by her employer for her gender-critical beliefs. In June 2021 Maya Forstater, who lost her job with the Centre for Global Development, won an appeal against the original employment tribunal decision.&lt;ref&gt;Maya Forstater v CGD Europe UKEAT/0105/20/JOJ&lt;/ref&gt; The Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) found that gender-critical beliefs, such as the view that sex is fixed and should not be conflated with gender identity, did qualify for protection under the [[Equality Act 2010]] (Equality Act).

In Resolution 2417 (2022), the [[Council of Europe]] condemned "the highly prejudicial anti-gender, gender-critical and anti-trans narratives which reduce the fight for the equality of LGBTI people to what these movements deliberately mischaracterise as 'gender ideology' or 'LGBTI ideology'. Such narratives deny the very existence of LGBTI people, dehumanise them, and often falsely portray their rights as being in conflict with women's and children's rights, or societal and family values in general. All of these are deeply damaging to LGBTI people, while also harming women's and children's rights and social cohesion." The resolution further deplored "the extensive and often virulent attacks on the rights of LGBTI people that have been occurring for several years in, among other countries, Hungary, Poland, the Russian Federation, Turkey and the United Kingdom."&lt;ref name=Resolution2417&gt;{{cite web |title=Resolution 2417 (2022): Combating rising hate against LGBTI people in Europe |url=https://pace.coe.int/en/files/29712/html |date=25 January 2022 |publisher=[[Council of Europe]] |access-date=28 June 2023 |archive-date=19 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221119052750/https://pace.coe.int/en/files/29712/html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Duffy |first=Nick |date=25 January 2022 |title=Council of Europe condemns 'virulent attacks on LGBT rights' in the UK, Hungary and Poland |work=[[i (newspaper)|i]] |url=https://inews.co.uk/news/world/council-of-europe-condemns-virulent-attacks-on-lgbt-rights-uk-1423399 |access-date=30 January 2022 |archive-date=30 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220130182653/https://inews.co.uk/news/world/council-of-europe-condemns-virulent-attacks-on-lgbt-rights-uk-1423399 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Council of Europe compares UK to Russia and Poland over 'virulent attacks' on LGBT+ rights |url=https://www.thepinknews.com/2022/01/25/council-of-europe-uk-lgbt-trans-rights-russ-apoland/ |access-date=28 June 2023 |work=PinkNews |archive-date=30 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230530233726/https://www.thepinknews.com/2022/01/25/council-of-europe-uk-lgbt-trans-rights-russ-apoland/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
Although gender-critical feminism originated in the United States in the 1970s, it has largely fallen out of favor among American feminists.&lt;ref name="Burns 2019"/&gt; Some trans-exclusionary radical-feminist organizations do remain, however, such as [[WoLF]], a trans-exclusionary radical feminist organization that operates mainly within the United States.&lt;ref name="Burns 2019" /&gt;

=== South Korea ===
In 2016, the radical feminist online community [[Womad (website)|Womad]] split from the larger radical feminist online community [[Megalia]] after Megalia issued a ban on the use of certain explicit slurs against gay men and transgender people.

== Scholarly analysis ==

[[Lesbian studies]] scholars Carly Thomsen and Laurie Essig note that "transness has been and is the object of deep hostility within some marginalized forms of feminism. Skepticism among earlier anti-trans feminists, such as Janice Raymond, about trans women being "real" women has morphed into J.K. Rowling's Twitter feed where she has insisted that trans women are not women. These ideas are, of course, deplorable, but they are also quite fringe within feminist studies and activism in the US."&lt;ref name=Thomsen&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thomsen |first1=Carly |last2=Essig |first2=Laurie |title=Lesbian, feminist, TERF: a queer attack on feminist studies |journal=[[Journal of Lesbian Studies]] |date=2021 |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=27–44 |doi=10.1080/10894160.2021.1950270|pmid=34313195 |s2cid=236452285 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claire Thurlow notes that "the initial failure of TERF-related tropes to garner public support quickly influenced the terms of 'debate', with the rhetoric employed noticeably changed. Leaving aside that the term 'gender critical feminism' is tautology, its adoption represented the beginnings of a pivot by trans-exclusionary feminists towards language which obscures their trans-exclusionary focus. Alongside a shift from TERF to gender critical, 'anti-trans' became 'pro-women' and 'trans-exclusion' became the protection of 'sex-based rights'. These rather innocuous-sounding terms have been transformed into the language of division; exemplifying dog-whistle politics whereby the phrases act as a coded message of anti-transness to those initiated, while appearing 'reasonable' to the wider population."&lt;ref name=Thurlow/&gt; Gender studies scholars Serena Bassi and Greta LaFleur have noted that "TERFism is typically described as an originally fringe group of Anglophone—largely American, British, and Australian—1970s cultural feminism that has grown exponentially over the past decade partially due to heightened media exposure. In the past decade or so, the shorthand "TERF" has traveled globally through online spaces."&lt;ref name=Bassi&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bassi |first1=Serena |last2=LaFleur |first2=Greta |title=Introduction: TERFs, Gender-Critical Movements, and Postfascist Feminisms |journal=[[Transgender Studies Quarterly]] |date=2022 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=311–333 |doi=10.1215/23289252-9836008|s2cid=253052875 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cristan Williams notes that radical feminism has historically been predominantly trans-inclusive and considers trans-exclusionary views a minority or fringe view within radical feminism.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=Cristan |title=Radical Inclusion: Recounting the Trans Inclusive History of Radical Feminism |journal=Trans Studies Quarterly |date=2016 |volume=3 |issue=1–2 |pages=254–258 |doi=10.1215/23289252-3334463|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrera-Fernández and DePalma argued that "the increasingly belligerent popular discourses promoted by TERF groups since the 1970s [are] appropriating feminist discourses to produce arguments that contradict basic premises of feminism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carrera-Fernández |first1=María Victoria |last2=DePalma |first2=Renée |title=Feminism will be trans-inclusive or it will not be: Why do two cis-hetero woman educators support transfeminism? |journal=[[The Sociological Review]] |date=2020 |volume=68 |issue=4 |pages=745–762 |doi=10.1177/0038026120934686|s2cid=221097541 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry F. Fradella]] noted that "while much of contemporary feminist thought has moved past biological essentialism’s outdated embrace of a sex binary to embrace trans-equality, a relatively small but vocal group of self-proclaimed 'gender-critical feminists' (who are sometimes called trans-exclusionary radical feminists or 'TERFs,' for short) eschew transgender legal rights that they perceive as potentially threatening to the rights of cisgender women. Most gender-critical arguments in that regard are fallacious; they are based on myths and false narratives that misconstrue or ignore empirical data from both the natural and social sciences. Worse yet, the gender-critical position not only threatens to undermine equality under law, but also fosters narratives that contribute to the criminal victimization of transgender persons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fradella |first1=Henry F.|author-link=Henry F. Fradella |title=The Imperative of Rejecting 'Gender-Critical' Feminism in the Law |journal=William &amp; Mary Journal of Race, Gender, &amp; Social Justice |date=2023 |volume=30 |issue=2 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.4419750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with the anti-gender movement===
{{Main|Anti-gender movement}}
Bassi and LaFleur note that "the trans-exclusionary feminist (TERF) movement and the so-called anti-gender movement are only rarely distinguished as movements with distinct constitutions and aims."&lt;ref name=Bassi/&gt; Pearce et al. note that the concept of "[[gender ideology]]" "saw increasing circulation in [[TERF|trans-exclusionary radical feminist]] discourse" from around 2016.&lt;ref name=Pearce/&gt; Claire Thurlow noted that "despite efforts to obscure the point, gender critical feminism continues to rely on transphobic tropes, moral panics and essentialist understandings of men and women. These factors also continue to link trans-exclusionary feminism to anti-feminist reactionary politics and other 'anti-gender' movements."&lt;ref name=Thurlow&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thurlow |first1=Claire |title=From TERF to gender critical: A telling genealogy? |journal=[[Sexualities (journal)|Sexualities]] |date=2022 |doi=10.1177/13634607221107827|s2cid=252662057 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
