'''Gender-critical feminism''', also known as '''trans-exclusionary radical feminism''' or its acronym '''[[TERF]]''', is a perspective that is critical of the concept of [[gender identity]] and therefore skeptical of [[transgender rights]] demands, especially [[gender self-determination]], as proposed by mainstream [[LGBT rights organizations]]. In contrast with most [[Third wave feminism|third]] and [[Fourth wave feminism|fourth wave feminists]], gender-critical theorists typically maintain that [[Sex assignment|sex assigned at birth]], which they often refer to as "biological sex", is immutable and therefore that [[trans women]] are not women.

These views have been described as [[transphobia|transphobic]] by other feminists and are opposed by most feminist organizations and by LGBT+ rights organisations.&lt;ref name="Camminga B. 2020"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Canada 110"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Toutes des femmes"/&gt; Gender-critical views have achieved a degree of prominence in the [[United Kingdom]], where they have been at the centre of a number of high-profile controversies. In several countries, the gender-critical movement has been linked to the [[anti-gender movement]],&lt;ref name="Council of Europe 2021"/&gt; and in some countries gender-critical groups have formed alliances with conservative, far-right, and anti-feminist organisations.&lt;ref name="Butler idea of ‘gender’ backlash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CTV hate rise Canada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alm &amp; Engebretsen 2020"/&gt;

== History ==

=== United Kingdom ===

Start around 2011.

In 2016, the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]' [[Women and Equalities Committee]] issued a report recommending that the [[Gender Recognition Act 2004]] be updated "in line with the principles of [[gender self-declaration]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmselect/cmwomeq/390/39010.htm#_idTextAnchor213|title=Transgender Equality|last1=Women and Equalities Committee|date=8 January 2016|publisher=House of Commons|quote=Within the current Parliament, the Government must bring forward proposals to update the Gender Recognition Act, in line with the principles of gender self-declaration that have been developed in other jurisdictions. In place of the present medicalised, quasi-judicial application process, an administrative process must be developed, centred on the wishes of the individual applicant, rather than on intensive analysis by doctors and lawyers.|access-date=1 November 2021|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2016, in [[England and Wales]], a proposal was developed under [[Theresa May]]'s government to revise the Act to introduce self-identification, with a public consultation opening in 2018. This proposed reform became a key locus of conflict for the emerging gender-critical movement, seeking to block reform of the Act, with a number of groups such as [[Fair Play For Women]], [[For Women Scotland]], and [[Woman's Place UK]] being formed. The 2018 found a significant majority of respondents in favour of the GRA reforms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/response-to-the-gender-recognition-act-2004-consultation |title=Reform of the Gender Recognition Act — Analysis of consultation responses |first1=Daniel |last1=King |author2=Carrie Paechter |author3=Maranda Ridgway |publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]] |date=22 September 2020 |access-date=21 October 2021 |id=CP&amp;nbsp;294 |pages=8–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in 2020, [[Second Johnson ministry|Boris Johnson's government]] dropped the reforms, instead reducing the cost of a gender recognition certificate and moving the application process online. 

Another key locus of conflict for the emerging movement was the stance of LGBT+ rights charity [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]] on trans issues. In 2015, Stonewall had begun campaigning for trans equality, with Stonewall head [[Ruth Hunt]] apologising for the organisation's previous failure to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gani|first1=Aisha|title=Stonewall to start campaigning for trans equality|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/16/stonewall-start-campaigning-trans-equality|access-date=31 May 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=16 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426042549/http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/16/stonewall-start-campaigning-trans-equality|archive-date=26 April 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2019, the [[LGB Alliance]] was founded in opposition to Stonewall, accusing the organisation of having "undermined women's sex-based rights and protections" and attempting "to introduce confusion between biological sex and the notion of gender."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Hellen |first=Nicholas |date=22 September 2019 |title='Anti-women' trans policy may split Stonewall |work=The Sunday Times |location= London |url= https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/anti-women-trans-policy-may-split-stonewall-wfv2rp5cx |access-date=13 February 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Insert comments linking the Alliance to notable gender-critical feminists, to maintain its relevance to this article''.

''Introduce Jeffreys and her theoretical position before the campaign, vis-à-vis NOTNEWS. It might be better to move much of the legal material to the judicial section, below, so that the gender-critical viewpoint is explained first (through representative figures) before the specific legal interventions''.
2019 saw the formation of the [[Women's Human Rights Campaign]] by [[Sheila Jeffreys]] and Heather Brunskell-Evans after Brunskell-Evans had been sacked from the [[Women's Equality Party]] as a result of her views on transgender people. The Campaign published a manifesto titled the ''Declaration on Women's Sex-Based Rights'', which argued that recognising trans women as women "constitutes discrimination against women" and called for the "elimination of that act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MPs urged by anti-trans ‘women’s rights’ group to eliminate ‘transgenderism’ and scrap Gender Recognition Act |url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/01/27/womens-human-rights-campaign-gender-recognition-act-inquiry-trans-transphobia/ |access-date=2 December 2021 |work=[[Pink News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.womensdeclaration.com/en/declaration-womens-sex-based-rights-full-text/&lt;/ref&gt; 

2019 also saw a number of high profile court cases in the UK launched by gender-critical figures, including [[Maya Forstater v Centre for Global Development]] and [[Bell v Tavistock]]. ''Replace Rowling and Linehan with actual feminists commenting on the cases from a gender-critical perspective. This shouldn't be hard. [[Joanna Cherry]] should also be introduced here.''

A 2020 paper in [[SAGE Open]] said that "the case against trans inclusion in the United Kingdom has been presented primarily through social media and blog-type or journalistic online platforms lacking the traditional prepublication checks of academic peer review".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zanghellini |first1=Aleardo |title=Philosophical Problems With the Gender-Critical Feminist Argument Against Trans Inclusion |journal=SAGE Open |date=1 April 2020 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=2158244020927029 |doi=10.1177/2158244020927029 |s2cid=219733494 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some public figures such as [[Graham Linehan]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/11/12/gender-critical-coming-out-day-trans-graham-linehan-mumsnet/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://gcn.ie/graham-linehan-trans-conversion-therapy/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/27/entertainment/graham-linehan-twitter-removal-trnd/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J.K.

=== Transgender rights and women's rights ===

The gender-critical movement argued that recognition of transgender people, particularly trans women, conflicts with women's rights... 

The gender critical movement has also been critical of attempts to ban conversion therapy... &lt;ref&gt;https://www.teenvogue.com/story/gender-critical-support-board-trans-youth&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender-segregated spaces ===

=== Socialisation and gender nonconformity ===

=== Transgender healthcare ===

The gender-critical movement has advocated for increased restrictions on trans-related healthcare, including hormone therapy and reconstructive surgeries...

== Judicial activism by gender-critical feminists ==

Mostly UK, but also US and wherever else can be sourced. '''Note that to be DUE for inclusion, these cases need to be tied to actual feminism, either through participating figures (e.g., [[Sheila Jeffreys]], [[Julie Bindel]]) or concepts from gender-critical legal theory.''' We can't assume that every anti-trans argument ever made in court is relevant to this article.

In 2019, the [[Maya Forstater v Centre for Global Development]] tribunal case was launched by members of the gender-critical movement, crowdfunding over £120,000. Earlier that year, Forstater's consulting contract for the [[Center for Global Development|Centre for Global Development]] was not renewed after she made a number of social media posts describing [[trans woman|transgender women]] as men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2019-12-19|title=Researcher who lost job for tweeting 'men cannot change into women' loses employment tribunal|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/maya-forstater-transgender-test-case-equalities-act-employment-tribunal-a9253211.html|access-date=2021-01-30|website=The Independent|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forstater subsequently sued the Centre, alleging that she had been discriminated against because of her views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/amfightingfor-therightto-saymen-cannever-bewomen//|title='I am fighting for the right to say men can never be women'|last=Gordon|first=Jane|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=April 23, 2021|access-date=April 23, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forstater lost her initial case, with the judge ruling that her beliefs were not protected under the Equality Act due to their absolutism. However, in April 2021, the initial judgement was reversed, with the [[Employment Appeal Tribunal]] ruling that gender-critical beliefs were protected under the Equality Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cross |first1=Michael |title=Appeal backs woman over ‘transphobic tweets’ 10 June 2021 |url=https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/law/appeal-backs-woman-over-transphobic-tweets/5108799.article |website=lawgazette |publisher=Law Society Gazette |access-date=17 June 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full merits hearing on Forstater's claim that she lost her employment as a result of these beliefs will subsequently be heard in March 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|last=Forstater|first=Maya|user=MForstater|number=1416040503079018497|date=July 16, 2021|title=Breaking news (from Employment Tribunal case management hearing this morning) Forstater case to go to full hearing in March 2022 !}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2020, Ann Sinnott, at the time a director of the [[LGB Alliance]], initiated a legal case calling for a judicial review of the [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]]'s guidance on the [[Equality Act 2010]], crowdfunding almost £100,000 for legal fees. The Alliance believes that the specifics of the [[Equality Act 2010]] have been "misrepresented" by some organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=EHRC|url=https://lgballiance.org.uk/ehrc/|access-date=10 May 2021|website=LGB Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2021 the case was found by the court to be [[Void (law)|unarguable]], Justice Henshaw stating that "the claimant has shown no arguable reason to believe the Code has mislead or will mislead service providers about their responsibilities under the Act."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=6 May 2021|title=Judge throws out LGB Alliance founder's fight to ban trans women from women's spaces|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/05/06/lgb-alliance-ann-sinnott-judicial-review-fails-london-high-court-equality-act/|access-date=10 May 2021|website=[[PinkNews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later in 2020, the [[Bell v Tavistock]] case was heard by the [[High Court of Justice]]. Keira Bell had been prescribed puberty blockers by the [[NHS Gender Identity Development Service]] when she was 16 and then had a double mastectomy at the age of 20, which she came to regret. Bell subsequently sued to have prescriptions for puberty blockers to people under the age of 18 to be banned in England and Wales. The High Court initially ruled that minors under the age of 16 could not consent to puberty blockers and that minors aged 17 and 18 would need to seek court approval to determine their competency for the prescription, however, the ruling was overturned on appeal in September 2021.

=== Gender-critical legal theory ===
"sex-based rights"?

Human rights scholar Sandra Duffy described the concept of "sex-based rights" as "a fiction with the pretense of legality," noting that “[[international human rights law]] is not static or originalist.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Duffy |first1=Sandra |title=An International Human Rights Law Analysis of the WHRC Declaration |url=https://sandraduffy.wordpress.com/2021/10/26/an-international-human-rights-law-analysis-of-the-whrc-declaration/ |access-date=4 December 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political alliances with conservatives and the far right==

Feminist [[Judith Butler]] has described the anti-gender movements as [[fascism|fascist]] trends and cautioned self-declared feminists from allying with such movements in targeting trans, non-binary, and genderqueer people.&lt;ref name="Butler idea of ‘gender’ backlash"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Butler |first1=Judith |title=Why is the idea of ‘gender’ provoking backlash the world over? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2021/oct/23/judith-butler-gender-ideology-backlash |work=The Guardian|access-date=17 November 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butler said that "it is painful to see that Trump’s position that gender should be defined by biological sex, and that the evangelical and right-wing Catholic effort to purge ‘gender’ from education and public policy accords with the trans-exclusionary radical feminists’ return to biological essentialism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Judith Butler artfully dismantles trans-exclusionary feminism and JK Rowling.

The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], an American civil rights nonprofit, reported in 2017 that American [[Christian right]] groups were trying to "separate the T from LGB", including via casting transgender rights as antagonistic to feminism or to lesbian or gay people. The report said this trend was "part of a larger strategy, meant to weaken transgender rights advocates by attempting to separate them from their allies, feminists and LGBT rights advocates".&lt;ref name="lgbtqnation_2017-10-23" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nbcnews_2019-01-29/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=23 October 2017|title=Christian Right tips to fight transgender rights: separate the T from the LGB|url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/10/23/christian-right-tips-fight-transgender-rights-separate-t-lgb|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190509105216/https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/10/23/christian-right-tips-fight-transgender-rights-separate-t-lgb|archive-date=9 May 2019|access-date=9 May 2019|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2019, the [[Heritage Foundation]], an American conservative think tank, hosted a panel of self-described radical feminists opposed to the US [[Equality Act (United States)|Equality Act]].&lt;ref name=nbcnews_2019-01-29 /&gt; Heron Greenesmith of [[Political Research Associates]], an American liberal think tank, has said that the latest iteration of collaboration between conservatives and anti-transgender feminists is in part a reaction to the trans community's "incredible gains" in civil rights and visibility, and that anti-trans feminists and conservatives capitalize on a "scarcity mindset rhetoric" whereby civil rights are portrayed as a limited commodity and must be prioritized to cisgender women over other groups. Greenesmith compared this rhetoric to the right-wing tactic of prioritizing the rights of citizens over non-citizens and white people over people of color.&lt;ref name=nbcnews_2019-01-29 /&gt; Bev Jackson, one of the founders of the [[LGB Alliance]], has argued in contrast that "working with the Heritage Foundation is sometimes the only possible course of action" since "the leftwing silence on gender in the US is even worse than in the UK."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/08/21/lgb-alliance-founder-bev-jackson-heritage-foundation-tweets/|title = LGB Alliance founder defends "feminists" working with Heritage Foundation|date = 21 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2020 article in [[Lambda Nordica]], Erika Alm of the [[University of Gothenburg]] and Elisabeth L. Engebretsen of the [[University of Stavanger]], said that there was "growing convergence, and sometimes conscious alliances, between “gender-critical” feminists (sometimes known as TERFs - Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminists), religious and social conservatives, as well as right-wing politics and even neo-Nazi and fascist movements" and that the convergence was linked to "their reliance on an essentialised and binary understanding of sex and/or gender, often termed 'bio-essentialism{{' "}}.&lt;ref name="Alm &amp; Engebretsen 2020"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alm |first1=Erika |last2=Engebretsen |first2=Elisabeth L. |title=Gender Self-identification |journal=Lambda Nordica |date=15 June 2020 |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=48–56 |doi=10.34041/ln.v25.613 |s2cid=225712334 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2020 article, in [[The Sociological Review]], said that "the language of ‘gender ideology’ originates in anti-feminist and anti-trans discourses among right-wing Christians, with the Catholic Church acting as a major nucleating agent", and said that the term "saw increasing circulation in trans-exclusionary radical feminist discourse" from around 2016.

In a 2021 paper in [[Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society]], Hil Malatino of [[Pennsylvania State University]] said that "'gender-critical' feminism" in the US has "begun to build coalition with the evangelical Right around the legal codification of sex as a biological binary" and that "popular news media frames transphobia as part of a rational, enlightened, pragmatic response to what is variously called the 'trans lobby' and the 'cult of trans.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/713292?journalCode=signs|doi = 10.1086/713292|title = The Promise of Repair: Trans Rage and the Limits of Feminist Coalition|year = 2021|last1 = Malatino|first1 = Hil|journal = Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume = 46|issue = 4|pages = 827–851|s2cid = 235304979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2021 paper, in [[Law and Social Inquiry]], said that "a coalition of Christian conservative legal organizations, conservative foundations, Trump administration officials, Republican party lawmakers, and trans-exclusionary radical feminists has assembled to redefine the right to privacy in service of anti-transgender politics" and that "social conservatives have cast the issue as one of balancing two competing rights claims rather than one of outright animus against a gender minority population."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/law-and-social-inquiry/article/abs/conservative-right-to-privacy-legal-ideological-and-coalitional-transformations-in-us-social-conservatism/E8447529C46B772F9172ED7E13D705CD&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies over freedom of speech and academic freedom ==

Conflict between gender-critical feminists and other feminists and transgender rights activists has resulted in controversies in which the principles of freedom of speech and academic freedom have been invoked. In Canada, conflicts have erupted over these issues in public libraries in Halifax, Toronto and Vancouver. In the United States, similar conflicts have erupted at university campuses in the broader context of the [[Culture wars]].

Kathleen Lowrey, who had allegedly been fired from her additional position as associate chair of undergraduate programs for the department of anthropology at the [[University of Alberta]] after displaying gender-critical posters on her office door, teaching gender-critical material in class, and showing up halfway through a student-run queer anthology event to start arguments about "the existence and validity of trans people with a trans man in the room,"&lt;ref&gt;https://thegatewayonline.ca/2020/06/professor-lowrey-dismayed-over-dismissal-from-admin-role/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/u-of-a-professor-says-she-was-dismissed-over-views-that-biological-sex-trumps-transgender-identity-for-policy-decisions/&lt;/ref&gt; published a paper in [[Archives of Sexual Behavior]] saying that she found it particularly distressing that "almost all of my most enthusiastic public attackers were feminist academic women" and that gender-critical feminists "root their analysis in the materiality of biological sex and take the oppression of women to be linked to the control of reproduction. In the present scholarly ecumene, this aligns them in some respects with scholars who are traditional and conservative, and explains why they, like conservatives, are so often in trouble with their institutions under present conditions."&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-021-01950-9&lt;/ref&gt;


Carolyn Sale of the Center for Free Expression at Ryerson University condemned the university's decision, saying that "the idea that in a hush behind closed doors students can bring complaints that don’t have to be proven true and can do so in order to protect their “safety” should alarm us all."&lt;ref&gt;https://cfe.ryerson.ca/blog/2020/06/academic-freedom-and-perceptions-harm&lt;/ref&gt; Lowrey later

In February 2020, 28 feminist and LGBT+ groups in France co-signed an declaration titled ''Toutes des femmes'' denouncing trans-exclusionary feminism, saying that "questions disguised as 'legitimate concerns' quickly give way to more violent attacks" and that "it is a confusionist and conspiratorial ideological movement using the cover of feminism to disrupt real feminist fights.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.liberation.fr/debats/2020/02/26/le-debat-sur-la-place-des-femmes-trans-n-a-pas-lieu-d-etre_1779708/&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration has since had over 100 feminist, LGBT+, and progressive groups additionally co-sign.&lt;ref name="Toutes des femmes"&gt;https://toutesdesfemmes.fr/signataires/&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2021, over 110 women's and human rights organisations in Canada signed a statement stating that they "vehemently reject the dangerous and bigoted rhetoric and ideology espoused by Trans Exclusionary Radical ‘Feminists’ (TERFs)", and saying that "trans people are a driving force in our feminist movements and make incredible contributions across all facets of our society."&lt;ref name="Canada 110"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.actioncanadashr.org/news/2021-05-04-our-feminism-trans-inclusive|title = Our Feminism is Trans Inclusive. &amp;#124; Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Judith Butler]] said in 2020 that trans-exclusionary radical feminism is "a fringe movement that is seeking to speak in the name of the mainstream, and that our responsibility is to refuse to let that happen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Judith Butler on the culture wars, JK Rowling and living in "anti-intellectual times" |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/uncategorized/2020/09/judith-butler-culture-wars-jk-rowling-and-living-anti-intellectual-times |access-date=17 November 2021 |work=New Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2021, the [[Council of Europe]] Committee on Equality and Non-Discrimination published a report titled ''Combating rising hate against LGBTI people in Europe'', which condemned "the highly prejudicial anti-gender, gender-critical and anti-trans narratives which reduce the fight for the equality of LGBTI people to what these movements deliberately mis-characterise as “[[gender ideology]]” or “[[LGBT "ideology"|LGBTI ideology]]”" and which said there was "a direct link between heteronormativity and heterosexism, on the one hand, and the growing anti-gender and gender-critical movements."&lt;ref name="Council of Europe 2021"&gt;{{citation |url=https://assembly.coe.int/LifeRay/EGA/Pdf/TextesProvisoires/2021/20210921-RisingHateLGBTI-EN.pdf |title=Combating rising hate against LGBTI people in Europe (Provisional version) |first=Fourat |last=Ben Chika |publisher=[[Council of Europe]] Committee on Equality and Non-Discrimination |date=21 September 2021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
