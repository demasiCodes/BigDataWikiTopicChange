'''Racism in Canada''' traces both historical and contemporary [[racist]] community attitudes, as well as governmental negligence and political non-compliance with United Nations human rights standards and incidents in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="OHCHR"&gt;{{cite web |title=International Convention on the Elimination of A ll Forms of Racial and Sexual Discrimination |url=http://docstore.ohchr.org/SelfServices/FilesHandler.ashx?enc=6QkG1d%2fPPRiCAqhKb7yhsoFZxvnsZjtq1Xnb4bcEJClA0kmqJQeV0zdR93%2ffv7%2fBSAkon8Nc2CMTKCBgv25nw5etVi%2bkUMR9abtAFqi1lgW095I%2btkhuhVTozo2kfkhQV78slhAW5U9xPBqn413aeA%3d%3d |website=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights |accessdate=22 October 2020|date=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Canada is the product of indigenous [[First Nations]] combined with multiple waves of immigration, predominantly from [[Asia]] and [[Europe]]. 

==Overview==
In general, [[White Canadians]] consider themselves to be mostly free of [[Racism|racial prejudice]], perceiving the country to be a more inclusive society, a notion that has come under criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/12/canada-black-lives-matter-indigenous-people-muslims|title=Canada is hailed for its tolerance but is it ready to confront its racism?|last=Kassam|first=Ashifa|date=2016-07-12|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-12-06|archive-date=June 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190612154417/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/12/canada-black-lives-matter-indigenous-people-muslims|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2015/07/21/no-charges-against-peel-police-in-death-of-jermaine-carby.html|title=No charges against Peel police in death of Jermaine Carby &amp;#124; The Star|website=thestar.com|access-date=October 7, 2020|archive-date=September 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200903105624/https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2015/07/21/no-charges-against-peel-police-in-death-of-jermaine-carby.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] population in Canada has been treated badly and sustained major hardships.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Glavin, [https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/columnists/glavin-canadians-have-no-reason-to-be-smug-about-race "Canadians have no reason to be smug about race"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704092855/http://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/columnists/glavin-canadians-have-no-reason-to-be-smug-about-race |date=July 4, 2018 }} (November 2014), ''The Ottawa Citizen''&lt;/ref&gt; These perceptions of inclusion and "[[Color blindness (race)|colour-blindness]]" have been challenged in recent years, with scholars such as [[Constance Backhouse]] stating that white supremacy is still prevalent in the country's legal system, with blatant racism created and enforced through the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Colour-coded: A Legal History of Racism in Canada, 1900–1950|last=Backhouse|first=Constance|publisher=The Osgoode Society for Canadian Legal History|year=1999|isbn=|location=Toronto|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one commentator, Canadian "racism contributes to a self-perpetuating cycle of criminalization and imprisonment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://torontolife.com/city/life/skin-im-ive-interrogated-police-50-times-im-black/|title=The Skin I'm In: I've been interrogated by police more than 50 times—all because I'm black|date=April 21, 2015|access-date=October 7, 2020|archive-date=October 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024073606/https://torontolife.com/city/life/skin-im-ive-interrogated-police-50-times-im-black/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, throughout Canada's history there have been laws and regulations that have negatively affected a wide variety of races, religions, and groups of persons.&lt;ref name=McGill&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Canada 1885"&gt;''Statutes of Canada.

Canadian law uses the term "[[visible minority]]" to refer to [[people of colour]] (but not aboriginal Canadians), introduced by the [[Employment equity (Canada)|Employment Equity Act of 1995]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Employment Equity Act (1995, c. 44) |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/E-5.401/50293.html/?noCookie |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212153447/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/E-5.401/50293.html/?noCookie |archivedate=February 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination stated this term may be considered objectionable by certain minorities and recommended an evaluation of this term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/A.67.18%20English.pdf|website=United Nations|publisher=United Nations: Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination|accessdate=4 March 2017|archive-date=April 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411143230/https://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/A.67.18%20English.pdf|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2020, Canadian university students attracted media attention by sharing on Instagram their experiences of racism on campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bowden|first=Olivia|date=10 September 2020|title=Canadian university students use Instagram to reveal racism on campuses|work=CBC|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canada-universities-racism-instagram-1.5716603|url-status=live|access-date=|archive-date=October 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201003205849/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canada-universities-racism-instagram-1.5716603}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cansplaining ===
Similarly, a term that has been labelled as "Cansplaining" is when an article, column, or report in a media publication both domestic and international offers a definitive explanation about Canada. It’s often written by a [[Canadian]] — a "Cansplainer", and its tone overflows with confidence about the country. It tends to provide a grand unified theory of Canada, representing a desire to control the country’s reputation in order to convince about politics and public policy, using Canada as a metaphor, case study and controlled experiment.&lt;ref name=JJMc&gt;{{Cite news|last=J.J|first=McCullough|date=13 July 2018|title=Cansplaining 101: How to write about Canada|work=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2018/07/13/cansplaining-101-how-to-write-about-canada/|url-status=live|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such works are usually exaggerated or flattering, and it presents Canada as a country that has solved big challenges commonly faced in the world — such as immigration and healthcare — better than anyone else. At the same time, topics such as the Canadian economy or trends in employment, infrastructure, housing are rarely discussed or mentioned. Recently, this often takes the form of praising Canada’s apparent immunity to movements such as the rising [[right-wing nationalism]] seen in other [[Western world|Western countries]], particularly the [[United States]] during the [[Trump administration]].&lt;ref name=JJMc&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's treatment of [[First Nations]] people is governed by the [[Indian Act]]. Many indigenous people were [[Cultural assimilation|assimilated]] into the [[Canadian Indian residential school system]]. European settlers assumed the indigenous people needed saving; this is a form of "charitable racism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Alfred |first=Taiaiake |location=Ontario |editor1=M.

In 1914, Indians arriving in Canada were not allowed to enter despite being [[British subject|British subjects]] leading to the deaths of dozens of immigrants in the [[Komagata Maru incident|''Komagata Maru'' incident]].

==== [[Chinese Canadians]] ====

Starting in 1858, [[Chinese people|Chinese]] "[[coolies]]" were brought to Canada to work in British Columbia in the mines and on the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]].{{sfn|Wilford|2011|p=28}}  After anti-Chinese riots broke out in 1886, a "[[Chinese head tax in Canada|Chinese head tax]]" was implemented to curtail immigration from China.  In 1907, the [[Anti-Oriental Riots (Vancouver)|Anti-Oriental Riots]] in [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]] targeted Chinese and Japanese-owned businesses, and the Asiatic Exclusion League was formed to drive Asians out of the province. League members attacked Asians, resulting in numerous riots.{{sfn|Wilford|2011|p=28}} In 1923, the federal government passed the [[Chinese Immigration Act of 1923|Chinese Immigration Act]], commonly known as the ''Exclusion Act'', prohibiting most Chinese immigration.{{sfn|Wilford|2011|p=29}}  The act was repealed in 1947,{{sfn|Melnyk|Seiler|2003|p=279}} but discrimination limiting non-European immigrants continued until 1967 when a points-based system was introduced to assess immigrants regardless of origin.

==== [[Japanese Canadians]] ====

Although a British–Japanese treaty guaranteed Japanese citizens freedom of travel, they were nevertheless subject to anti-Asian racism in Canada, though a slightly lesser degree at the time than the Chinese before World War II, as an informal agreement between the Japanese and Canadian governments limited Japanese immigration in the wake of the [[Anti-Oriental riots (Vancouver)|Vancouver anti-Asian riots]].{{sfn|Melnyk|Seiler|2003|p=279}} 

In 1942, during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], many Canadians of Japanese heritage—even those born in Canada— were forcibly [[Japanese-Canadian internment|moved to internment camps]] under the authority of the [[War Measures Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/m/article/japanese-canadians/|title=Japanese Canadians|newspaper=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2016-12-06|archive-date=January 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119120305/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/m/article/japanese-canadians/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, many men were separated from their families and sent to road camps in Ontario and on the [[British Columbia]]–[[Alberta]] border. Small towns in the [[British Columbia|BC]] interior such as [[Greenwood, British Columbia|Greenwood]], [[Sandon, British Columbia|Sandon]], [[New Denver]] and [[Slocan, British Columbia|Slocan]] became internment camps for women, children and the aged. To stay together, Japanese–Canadian families chose to work in farms in [[Alberta]] and [[Manitoba]]. Those who resisted and challenged the orders of the Canadian government were rounded up by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and incarcerated in a barbed-wire prisoner-of-war camp in Angler, [[Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.japanesecanadianhistory.net/the_war_years.htm|title=JapaneseCanadianHistory.net Historical Overview|website=www.japanesecanadianhistory.net|access-date=2016-12-06|archive-date=November 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108140759/http://www.japanesecanadianhistory.net/the_war_years.htm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese–Canadians fishing boats were also seized, with plans to drastically reduce fishing licenses from them and forcibly redistribute them for white Canadians.&lt;ref name="r-m"&gt;[http://journals.sfu.ca/archivar/index.php/archivaria/article/view/12837/14056 Establishing Recognition of Past Injustices: Uses of Archival Records in Documenting the Experience of Japanese Canadians During the Second World War]. Roberts-Moore, Judith. Archivaria: The Journal of the Association of Canadian Archivists, 53 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; With government promises to return the land and properties seized during that time period, Japanese Canadians left their homes. This turned out to be untrue, as the seized possessions were resold and never returned to the Japanese Canadians. Unlike prisoners of war, who were protected by the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Convention]], Japanese–Canadians were forced to pay for their own internment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://history.cbc.ca/histoire/?MIval=EpisContent.html&amp;series_id=1&amp;episode_id=14&amp;chapter_id=3&amp;page_id=3&amp;lang=E |title=Japanese Internment |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221071212/http://history.cbc.ca/histoire/?MIval=EpisContent.html&amp;series_id=1&amp;episode_id=14&amp;chapter_id=3&amp;page_id=3&amp;lang=E |archivedate=December 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
