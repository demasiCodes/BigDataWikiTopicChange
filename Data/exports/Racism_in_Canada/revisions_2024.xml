In 1914, Indians arriving in Canada were not allowed to enter despite being [[British subject]]s, leading to the deaths of dozens of immigrants in the [[Komagata Maru incident|''Komagata Maru'' incident]].

Starting in 1858, [[Chinese people|Chinese]] "[[coolies]]" were brought to Canada to work in British Columbia in the mines and on the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilford |first=Timothy |date=2011 |title=Canada's Road to the Pacific War: Intelligence, Strategy, and the Far East Crisis |location=Vancouver |publisher=USB Press |isbn=978-0-7748-2124-7 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After anti-Chinese riots broke out in 1886, a "[[Chinese head tax in Canada|Chinese head tax]]" was implemented to curtail immigration from China.  In 1907, the [[Anti-Oriental Riots (Vancouver)|Anti-Oriental Riots]] in [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]] targeted Chinese and Japanese-owned businesses, and the Asiatic Exclusion League was formed to drive Asians out of the province. League members attacked Asians, resulting in numerous riots.{{sfn|Wilford|2011|p=28}} In 1923, the federal government passed the ''[[Chinese Immigration Act of 1923|Chinese Immigration Act]]'', commonly known as the ''Exclusion Act'', prohibiting most Chinese immigration.{{sfn|Wilford|2011|p=29}}  The Act was repealed in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Melnyk |editor1-first=George |editor2-last=Seiler |editor2-first=Tamara Palmer |title=The Wild Rose Anthology of Alberta Prose |date=2003 |publisher=University of Calgary Press |isbn=9781552380796 |url={{GBurl|g3TpVzpupaUC}} |page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; but discrimination limiting non-European immigrants continued until 1967 when a points-based system was introduced to assess immigrants regardless of origin.

==== Japanese Canadians ====

{{See also|Japantown, Vancouver|Internment of Japanese Canadians}}

Although a British–Japanese treaty guaranteed Japanese citizens freedom of travel, they were nevertheless subject to anti-Asian racism in Canada, though a slightly lesser degree at the time than the Chinese before World War II, as an informal agreement between the Japanese and Canadian governments limited Japanese immigration in the wake of the [[Anti-Oriental riots (Vancouver)|Vancouver anti-Asian riots]].{{sfn|Melnyk|Seiler|2003|p=279}}

In 1942, during [[World War II]], many Canadians of Japanese heritage—even those born in Canada— were forcibly [[Japanese-Canadian internment|moved to internment camps]] under the authority of the ''[[War Measures Act]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Japanese Canadians |newspaper=The Canadian Encyclopedia |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/m/article/japanese-canadians/ |url-status=live |access-date=2016-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119120305/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/m/article/japanese-canadians/ |archive-date=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, many men were separated from their families and sent to road camps in Ontario and on the [[British Columbia]]–[[Alberta]] border. Small towns in the [[British Columbia|BC]] interior such as [[Greenwood, British Columbia|Greenwood]], [[Sandon, British Columbia|Sandon]], [[New Denver]] and [[Slocan, British Columbia|Slocan]] became internment camps for women, children and the aged. To stay together, Japanese–Canadian families chose to work in farms in [[Alberta]] and [[Manitoba]]. Those who resisted and challenged the orders of the Canadian government were rounded up by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and incarcerated in a barbed-wire prisoner-of-war camp in Angler, [[Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=JapaneseCanadianHistory.net Historical Overview |url=http://www.japanesecanadianhistory.net/the_war_years.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108140759/http://www.japanesecanadianhistory.net/the_war_years.htm |archive-date=November 8, 2017 |access-date=2016-12-06 |website=www.japanesecanadianhistory.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese–Canadians fishing boats were also seized, with plans to drastically reduce fishing licenses from them and forcibly redistribute them for white Canadians.&lt;ref name="r-m"&gt;[http://journals.sfu.ca/archivar/index.php/archivaria/article/view/12837/14056 Establishing Recognition of Past Injustices: Uses of Archival Records in Documenting the Experience of Japanese Canadians During the Second World War].

=== Sikhs ===
{{see also|Anti-Sikh sentiment in Canada|}}
Anti-Sikh sentiment in Canada has a historical and contemporary presence marked by several key events and ongoing issues. Early instances include the 1907 [[1907 Bellingham race riot|Bellingham Race Riot]], where South East Asian and South Asian immigrants, mostly Sikhs, were violently targeted by white mobs in [[Washington (state)]], spilling over into Canadian anti-immigrant sentiments and the [[Pacific Northwest]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Dutt |first=Nirupama |date=1 September 2017 |title=110 years after racial riots against early Sikh immigrants, an Arch of Healing in US city |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/110-years-after-racial-riots-against-early-sikh-immigrants-an-arch-of-healing-in-us-city/story-SjlbkYZ4r4cb0bJs65XL5L.html |work=Hindustan Times |quote=This has been reported by the Bellingham Herald newspaper which incidentally had also reported the 1907 riots.

The mob had listened that Saturday night to A. E. Fowler, an activist from Seattle who gave an “impassioned speech,” in which he invoked a riot against Sikh workers in Bellingham, Washington, just days earlier. Beyond the West Coast, white supremacism existed throughout the British Empire — personified by the presence of a New Zealand clergyman at the league’s meeting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1914 Komagata Maru incident incident further highlighted institutional racism when 376 Indian passengers, mostly Sikhs, were denied entry into Canada and forced to return to India, where many faced persecution. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Komagata Maru incident (1914) |url=http://biographi.ca/en/topics/topic-match-list.php?id=1615 |access-date=2024-07-27 |website=Dictionary of Canadian Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post [[September 11 attacks]], Sikhs in Canada experienced increased xenophobia and hate crimes, often being mistaken for Muslims due to their turbans and beards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sian |first=Katy |title=Surveillance, Islamophobia, and Sikh Bodies in the War on Terror |date=2017 |publisher=Center for Race and Gender, University of California, Berkeley |volume=4 |publication-date=2017 |pages=4 |quote=Both the US and Canada have seen a sharp increase of hate crimes waged against the Sikh population who have been ‘mistakenly’ targeted in racist attacks directed at Muslims – for example the first person to be killed in a ‘revenge attack’ following 9/11 was Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh turbaned man in Arizona}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, in response to repeated calls from Indigenous groups, activists, and non-governmental organizations, the Government of Canada under Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]], jointly with all provincial and territorial governments, established a national public inquiry into [[Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women|Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mmiwg-ffada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Final_Report_Vol_1a-1.pdf ''Reclaiming Power and Place:  The Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls'', Vol. 1a, pp. 59–60.]&lt;/ref&gt;
