'''Social justice''' is [[justice]] exercised within a [[society]], particularly as it is applied to and among the various [[social class]]es of a society.

A socially just society is one based upon the principles of [[social equality|equality]] and [[solidarity]]; which [[pedagogy]] also maintains that a socially just society both understands and values [[human rights]], as well as recognizing the dignity of every human being.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Education and Social Justice By J. Zajda, S. Majhanovich, V. Rust, 2006, ISBN 1-4020-4721-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;Nursing ethics: across the curriculum and into practice By Janie B. Butts, Karen Rich, Jones and Bartlett Publishers 2005, ISBN 978-0-7637-4735-0&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution of the [[International Labour Organization]] affirms that "universal and lasting peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Constitution of the International Labour Organization|The Preamble of ILO Constitution]]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] treats social justice as a purpose of the [[human rights education]].&lt;ref&gt;Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, Part II, D.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations’ 2006 document “Social Justice in an Open World: The Role of the United Nations”, states that “Social justice may be broadly understood as the fair and compassionate distribution of the fruits of economic growth...”&lt;ref&gt;“Social Justice in an Open World: The Role of the United Nations”, The International Forum for Social Development, DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS, Division for Social Policy and Development, ST/ESA/305, United Nations New York, 2006, P.16, http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/documents/ifsd/SocialJustice.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The same document reports,  “From the comprehensive global perspective shaped by the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, neglect of the pursuit of social justice in all its dimensions translates into de facto acceptance of a future marred by violence, repression and chaos.” &lt;ref&gt;Ibid. P.6&lt;/ref&gt;The report concludes, “Social justice is not possible without strong and coherent redistributive policies conceived and implemented by public agencies.” &lt;ref&gt;Ibid. P.16&lt;/ref&gt;

The same UN document offers a concise history: “[T]he notion of social justice is relatively new. None of history’s great philosophers—not Plato or Aristotle, or Confucius or Averroes, or even Rousseau or Kant—saw the need to consider justice or the redress of injustices from a social perspective. The concept first surfaced in Western thought and political language in the wake of the industrial revolution and the parallel development of the socialist doctrine. It emerged as an expression of protest against what was perceived as the capitalist exploitation of labour and as a focal point for the development of measures to improve the human condition. It was born as a revolutionary slogan embodying the ideals of progress and fraternity. Following the revolutions that shook Europe in the mid-1800s, social justice became a rallying cry for progressive thinkers and political activists.... By the mid-twentieth century, the concept of social justice had become central to the ideologies and programmes of virtually all the leftist and centrist political parties around the world...” &lt;ref&gt;Ibid. P.11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The term and modern concept of "social justice" was coined by [[Jesuit]] priest [[Luigi Taparelli|Father. Luigi Taparelli]] in 1840 based on the teachings of [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] and given further exposure in 1848 by [[Antonio Rosmini-Serbati | Father Antonio Rosmini-Serbati]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Battleground criminal justice by Gregg Barak, Greenwood publishing group 2007, ISBN 978-0-313-34040-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engineering and Social Justice By Donna Riley, Morgan and Claypool Publishers 2008, ISBN 978-1-59829-626-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spirituality, social justice, and language learning By David I. Smith, [[Terry A Osborn|Terry A. Osborn]], Information Age Publishing 2007, ISBN 1-59311-599-7&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was elaborated by the moral theologian [[John A. Ryan | Father. John A. Ryan]], who initiated the concept of a [[living wage]]. [[Coughlin | Father. Coughlin]] also used the term in his publications in the 1930s and the 1940s. It is a part of [[Catholic social teaching]], the Protestants' [[Social Gospel]], and is one of the [[Four Pillars of the Green Party]] upheld by [[Global Greens|green parties worldwide]]. Social justice as a secular concept, distinct from religious teachings, emerged mainly in the late twentieth century, influenced primarily by philosopher [[John Rawls]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]],  "Rawls, John," Cambridge University Press, pp. 774-775.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of social justice==
===Social justice from religious traditions===
====Judaism====
{{Main|Tikkun olam}}
In ''To Heal a Fractured World: The Ethics of Responsibility'', Rabbi [[Jonathan Sacks]] states that social justice has a central place in [[Judaism]]. One of Judaism’s most distinctive and challenging ideas is its ethics of responsibility reflected in the concepts of [[simcha]] ("gladness" or "joy"), [[tzedakah]] ("the religious obligation to perform charity and philanthropic acts"), [[chesed]] ("deeds of kindness"), and [[tikkun olam]] ("repairing the world").

====Christianity====
===== Catholicism =====
{{Main|Catholic social teaching}}
Catholic social teaching consists of those aspects of Roman Catholic doctrine which relate to matters dealing with the respect of the individual human life. A distinctive feature of the Catholic social doctrine is their concern for the poorest and most vulnerable members of society. Two of the seven key areas&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070608113958/http://www.usccb.org/sdwp/projects/socialteaching/excerpt.htm Seven Key Themes of Catholic Social Teaching]&lt;/ref&gt; of "Catholic social teaching" are pertinent to social justice:
* Life and dignity of the human person: The foundational principle of all "Catholic Social Teaching" is the sanctity of all human life and the inherent dignity of every human person, from conception to natural death. Human life must be valued above all material possessions.
* Preferential option for the poor and vulnerable: Catholics believe Jesus taught that on the [[Day of Judgement]] God will ask what each person did to help the poor and needy: "Amen, I say to you, whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 25:40.&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church believes that through words, prayers and deeds one must show solidarity with, and compassion for, the poor. The moral test of any society is "how it treats its most vulnerable members. The poor have the most urgent moral claim on the conscience of the nation. People are called to look at public policy decisions in terms of how they affect the poor."&lt;ref&gt;Option for the Poor, [http://www.osjspm.org/cst/themes.htm Major themes from Catholic Social Teaching], Office for Social Justice, Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before it was propounded in the Catholic social doctrine, social justice appeared regularly in the history of the Catholic Church:
* The term "social justice" was adopted by the [[Jesuit]] [[Luigi Taparelli]] in the 1840s, based on the work of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]]. He wrote extensively in his journal ''Civiltà Cattolica'', engaging both [[capitalism|capitalist]] and [[socialist]] theories from a [[natural law]] viewpoint. His basic premise was that the rival economic theories, based on subjective [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] thinking, undermined the unity of society present in [[Thomism|Thomistic]] [[metaphysics]]; neither the liberal capitalists nor the communists concerned themselves with public [[ethics|moral]] [[philosophy]].
* [[Pope Leo XIII]], who studied under Taparelli, published in 1891 the [[encyclical]] ''[[Rerum Novarum]]'' (On the Condition of the Working Classes), rejecting both socialism and capitalism, while defending labor unions and private property. He stated that society should be based on cooperation and not [[class conflict]] and [[competition]]. In this document, Leo set out the Catholic Church's response to the social instability and labor conflict that had arisen in the wake of industrialization and had led to the rise of socialism. The Pope advocated that the role of the State was to promote social justice through the protection of rights, while the Church must speak out on social issues in order to teach correct social principles and ensure class harmony.
* The encyclical ''[[Quadragesimo Anno]]'' (On Reconstruction of the Social Order, literally "in the fortieth year") of 1931 by [[Pope Pius XI]], encourages a [[living wage]], [[subsidiarity (Catholicism)|subsidiarity]], and advocates that social justice is a personal virtue as well as an attribute of the social order, saying that society can be just only if individuals and institutions are just.
* [[Pope John Paul II]] added much to the corpus of the [[Catholic social teaching]], penning three encyclicals which would deal with issues such as economics, politics, geo-political situations, ownership of the means of production, private property and the "[[social mortgage]]", and private property.  The encyclicals of [[Laborem Exercens]], [[Solicitudo Rei Socialis]], and [[Centesimus Annus]] are just a small portion of his overall contribution to Catholic social justice.  Pope John Paul II was a strong advocate of justice and human rights, and spoke forcefully for the poor.  He addresses issues such as the problems that technology can present should it be misused, and admits a fear that the "progress" of the world is not true progress at all, if it should denigrate the value of the human person.
* [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s encyclical ''[[Deus Caritas Est]]'' ("God is Love") of 2006 claims that justice is the defining concern of the state and the central concern of politics, and not of the church, which has charity as its central social concern. It said that the laity has the specific responsibility of pursuing social justice in civil society and that the church's active role in social justice should be to inform the debate, using reason and natural law, and also by providing moral and spiritual formation for those involved in politics.
* The official Catholic doctrine on '''social justice''' can be found in the book ''Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church'', published in 2004 and updated in 2006, by the [[Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace|Pontifical Council ''Iustitia et Pax'']].

For more information on Catholic's view of Social Justice, read The Catechism of the Catholic Church 1928-1948 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c2a3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Methodism=====
From its founding, Methodism was a Christian social justice movement.

Under [[John Wesley]]'s direction, Methodists became leaders in many social justice issues of the day, including the [[prison reform]] and [[abolitionism]] movements. Wesley himself was among the first to preach for slaves rights attracting significant opposition.&lt;ref&gt;S. R. Valentine, John Bennet &amp; the Origins of Methodism and the Evangelical revival in England, Scarecrow Press, Lanham, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carey, Brycchan. “John Wesley (1703–1791).” The British Abolitionists. Brycchan Carey, July 11, 2008. October 5, 2009. [http://www.brycchancarey.com/abolition/index.htm Brycchancarey.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wesley John, “Thoughts Upon Slavery,” John Wesley: Holiness of Heart and Life. Charles Yrigoyen, 1996. October 5, 2009. [http://gbgm-umc.org/umw/wesley/thoughtsuponslavery.stm Gbgm-umc.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, social justice plays a major role in the [[United Methodist Church]]. The ''Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church'' says, "it is a governmental responsibility to provide all citizens with health care."&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Discipline of The United Methodist Church – 2008 ¶162 V, [http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=5066539&amp;ct=6467671&amp;notoc=1 umc.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The United Methodist Church also teaches [[Human population control|Population control]] as part of its doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Discipline of The United Methodist Church – 2008 ¶ 162 K, [http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=5066539&amp;ct=6467635&amp;notoc=1 umc.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinduism====
Ancient Hindu society was based on equality of all beings. However, to divide labor society divided itself into hundreds of tribes[Jati]. India was governed by people of non-Hindu faiths from the 8th century which caused ruptures in societal fabric. Caste is a word from the Portuguese word "casta" and caste came to define the jatis only 500 years ago. Considerable social engineering occurred during the British rule which impacted the society's self governance. There was some social injustice in which some jatis considered themselves superior to others. The present day jati hierarchy is undergoing changes for variety of reasons including 'social justice',which is a politically popular stance in democratic India. Institutionalized affirmative action has swung the pendulum.
The disparity and wide inequalities in social behaviour to some of the jatis led to various [[Social reformers of India|reform movements]] in hinduism for centuries.
While legally outlawed, the caste system remains strong in practice, with social and employment opportunities strongly governed by one's caste of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jayaram|first=V|title=The Hindu Caste System|url=http://www.hinduwebsite.com/hinduism/h_caste.asp|accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====

The [[Quran]] contains numerous references to elements of social justice. For example, one of Islam's Five Pillars is [[Zakāt]], or alms-giving. Charity and assistance to the poor – concepts central to social justice – are and have historically been important parts of the Islamic faith.

In Muslim history, Islamic governance has often been associated with social justice. Establishment of social justice was one of the motivating factors of the [[Umayyad#Insurrection|Abbasid revolt]] against the Umayyads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John L. Esposito]]|title=Islam and Politics|publisher=Syracuse University Press|year=1998|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shi'a believe that the return of the ''Mahdi'' will herald in "the messianic age of justice" and the Mahdi along with the Messiah (Jesus) will end plunder, torture, oppression and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John L. Esposito]]|title=Islam and Politics|publisher=Syracuse University Press|year=1998|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] the implementation of social justice would require the rejection of [[consumerism]] and [[communism]]. The Brotherhood strongly affirmed the right to private property as well as differences in personal wealth due to factors such as hard work. However, the Brotherhood held Muslims had an obligation to assist those Muslims in need. It held that ''zakat'' (alms-giving) was not voluntary charity, but rather the poor had the right to assistance from the more fortunate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John L. Esposito]]|title=Islam and Politics|publisher=Syracuse University Press|year=1998|pages=147–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Islamic governments therefore enforce the ''zakat'' through taxes. 

Though monetary donations are the most practiced way of [[zakat]], Islam is deeply rooted in the tenets of [[volunteerism]] and [[social activism]]. Areas of one's communities which require assistance and beneficiaries must be a Muslim's foci if need be, rather than strictly her or his personal or superficial wants.  For example, the [[ecological]] well-being of the planet (i.e.: animal rights, global warming, natural resources degradation); locally, nationally, globally, is a campaign to which every Muslim must adhere. Many Muslims practice this today by ensuring that they produce minimal waste, give to charity what they no longer need, and spend time in prayer and meditation upon the bounties of nature so as to more mindfully approach all that is provided by nature,and ultimately, [[Allah]].&lt;ref name=ecomuslim&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theecomuslim.com/|title=The Eco Muslim}}{{rs?|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other areas of society in need may be the safety and security of minority populations, i.e.: women or persons of color, children, the elderly, the developmentally or physically disabled, animals, et al.&lt;ref name=ecomuslim/&gt;
Social justice in Islam is a tenet to which every Muslim must corroborate in his or her daily life, and without which would create a void in all their efforts towards attaining true spirituality and a connection with God.

===John Rawls===
{{Main|John Rawls}}
Political philosopher [[John Rawls]] draws on the [[utilitarian]] insights of [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]], the [[social contract]] ideas of [[John Locke]], and the [[categorical imperative]] ideas of [[Kant]]. His first statement of principle was made in ''A Theory of Justice'' where he proposed that, "Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override. For this reason justice denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared by others.".&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls, A Theory of Justice (2005 reissue), Chapter 1, "Justice as Fairness" – 1. The Role of Justice, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; A [[deontological]] proposition that echoes Kant in framing the moral good of justice in [[Moral absolutism|absolutist]] terms. His views are definitively restated in ''[[Political Liberalism]]'' where society is seen "as a fair system of co-operation over time, from one generation to the next.".&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls, ''Political Liberalism'' 15 (Columbia University Press 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

All societies have a basic structure of social, economic, and political institutions, both formal and informal. In testing how well these elements fit and work together, Rawls based a key test of legitimacy on the theories of social contract. To determine whether any particular system of collectively enforced social arrangements is legitimate, he argued that one must look for agreement by the people who are subject to it, but not necessarily to an objective notion of justice based on coherent ideological grounding. Obviously, not every citizen can be asked to participate in a poll to determine his or her consent to every proposal in which some degree of coercion is involved, so one has to assume that all citizens are reasonable. Rawls constructed an argument for a two-stage process to determine a citizen's hypothetical agreement:
* The citizen agrees to be represented by X for certain purposes, and, to that extent, X holds these powers as a [[trustee]] for the citizen.
* X agrees that enforcement in a particular social context is legitimate. The citizen, therefore, is bound by this decision because it is the function of the trustee to represent the citizen in this way.
This applies to one person who represents a small group (e.g., the organiser of a social event setting a dress code) as equally as it does to national governments, which are ultimate trustees, holding representative powers for the benefit of all citizens within their territorial boundaries. Governments that fail to provide for [[social welfare|welfare]] of their citizens according to the principles of justice are not legitimate. To emphasise the general principle that justice should rise from the people and not be dictated by the law-making powers of governments, Rawls asserted that, "There is ... a general presumption against imposing legal and other restrictions on conduct without sufficient reason. But this presumption creates no special priority for any particular liberty."&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls, Political Liberalism 291–92 (Columbia University Press 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; This is support for an unranked set of liberties that reasonable citizens in all states should respect and uphold&amp;nbsp;— to some extent, the list proposed by Rawls matches the normative human rights that have international recognition and direct enforcement in some nation states where the citizens need encouragement to act in a way that fixes a greater degree of equality of outcome.

====The basic liberties according to Rawls====
* Freedom of thought;
* Liberty of conscience as it affects social relationships on the grounds of religion, philosophy, and morality;
* Political liberties (e.g. representative democratic institutions, freedom of speech and the press, and freedom of assembly);
* Freedom of association;
* Freedoms necessary for the liberty and integrity of the person (viz: freedom from slavery, freedom of movement and a reasonable degree of freedom to choose one's occupation); and
* Rights and liberties covered by the rule of law.

===Criticism===
The concept of social justice has come under criticism from a variety of perspectives.

Many authors criticize the idea that there exists an objective standard of social justice. [[moral relativism|Moral relativists]] deny that there is any kind of objective standard for justice in general. [[non cognitivism|Non-cognitivists]], [[moral skepticism|moral skeptics]], [[moral nihilism|moral nihilists]], and most [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] deny the epistemic possibility of objective notions of justice. [[Cynicism (contemporary)|Cynics]] (such as [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}) believe that any ideal of social justice is ultimately a mere justification for the [[status quo]].

Many other people accept some of the basic principles of social justice, such as the idea that all human beings have a basic level of value, but disagree with the elaborate conclusions that may or may not follow from this. One example is the statement by [[H. G. Wells]] that all people are "equally entitled to the respect of their fellowmen."&lt;ref&gt;"The Rights of Man", ''Daily Herald'', London, February 1940&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some scholars reject the very idea of social justice as meaningless, religious, self-contradictory, and ideological, believing that to realize any degree of social justice is unfeasible, and that the attempt to do so must destroy all liberty. Perhaps the most complete rejection of the concept of social justice comes from [[Friedrich Hayek]] of the [[Austrian School]] of economics:
{{quote|There can be no test by which we can discover what is 'socially unjust' because there is no subject by which such an injustice can be committed, and there are no rules of individual conduct the observance of which in the market order would secure to the individuals and groups the position which as such (as distinguished from the procedure by which it is determined) would appear just to us. [Social justice] does not belong to the category of error but to that of nonsense, like the term `a moral stone'.&lt;ref&gt;"Law, legislation, and liberty, Volume 3, The Mirage of Social Justice", F.A. Hayek, Routledge, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ben O'Neill of the [[University of New South Wales]] argues that, for proponents of "social justice":&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Ben (2011-03-16) [http://mises.org/daily/5099/The-Injustice-of-Social-Justice The Injustice of Social Justice], ''[[Mises Institute]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|the notion of "rights" is a mere term of entitlement, indicative of a claim for any possible desirable good, no matter how important or trivial, abstract or tangible, recent or ancient. It is merely an assertion of desire, and a declaration of intention to use the language of rights to acquire said desire.

In fact, since the program of social justice inevitably involves claims for government provision of goods, paid for through the efforts of others, the term actually refers to an intention to use ''force'' to acquire one's desires. Not to earn desirable goods by rational thought and action, production and voluntary exchange, but to go in there and forcibly take goods from those who can supply them!}}

[[Janusz Korwin-Mikke]] argues simply: "Either 'social justice' has the same meaning as 'justice' – or not. If so – why use the additional word 'social?' We lose time, we destroy trees to obtain paper necessary to print this word. If not, if 'social justice' means something different from 'justice' – then 'something different from justice' is by definition 'injustice'"

Sociologist [[Carl L. Bankston]] has argued that a secular, leftist view of social justice entails viewing the redistribution of goods and resources as based on the rights of disadvantaged categories of people, rather than on compassion or national interest. Bankston maintains that this secular version of social justice became widely accepted due to the rise of demand-side economics and to the moral influence of the civil rights movement.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2010"&gt;Social Justice: Cultural Origins of a Theory and a Perspective By Carl L. Bankston III, Independent Review vol. 15 no. 2, pp. 165–178, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmic values===
[[Hunter Lewis]]' work promoting natural healthcare and sustainable economies advocates for [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] as a key premise in social justice. His manifesto on [[sustainability]] ties the continued thriving of human life to real conditions, the environment supporting that life, and associates injustice with the detrimental effects of [[unintended consequences]] of human actions. Quoting classical Greek thinkers like [[Epicurus]] on the good of pursuing happiness, Hunter also cites ornithologist, naturalist, and philosopher [[Alexander Skutch]] in his book Moral Foundations:

{{quote|The common feature which unites the activities most consistently forbidden by the moral codes of civilized peoples is that by their very nature they cannot be both habitual and enduring, because they tend to destroy the conditions which make them possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anh-usa.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Sustainability-the-Complete-Concept1.pdf |author=Hunter Lewis |title=Sustainability, The Complete Concept, Environment, Healthcare, and Economy |date=October 14, 2009 |publisher=ChangeThis}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pope Benedict XVI cites [[Teilhard de Chardin]] in a vision of the cosmos as a 'living host' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncronline.org/news/ecology/pope-cites-teilhardian-vision-cosmos-living-host| author=John Allen Jr. |title=Ecology – The first stirring of an 'evolutionary leap' in late Jesuit's official standing?|date=Jul. 28, 2009 |publisher=National Catholic Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; embracing an understanding of ecology that includes mankinds's relationship to fellow men, that pollution affects not just the natural world but interpersonal relations also. Cosmic harmony, justice and peace are closely interrelated:

{{quote|If you want to cultivate peace, protect creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/1341681?eng=y/ |author=Sandro Magister |title=Benedict XVI to the Diplomats: Three Levers for Lifting Up the World |date=January 11, 2010 |publisher=www.chiesa, Rome}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Social justice movements==
Social justice is also a concept that is used to describe the movement towards a socially just world, i.e., the [[Global Justice Movement]]. In this context, social justice is based on the concepts of human rights and equality, and can be defined as ''"the way in which human rights are manifested in the everyday lives of people at every level of society"''.&lt;ref&gt;Just Comment – Volume 3 Number 1, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[social movement|movements]] are working to achieve social justice in society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialjustice.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/index.php/Main_Page Main Page – Social Justice Wiki&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070522080239/http://philebus.tamu.edu/~cmenzel/justice.html Social Justice and Social Justice Movements]&lt;/ref&gt; These movements are working towards the realization of a world where all members of a society, regardless of background or procedural justice, have basic human rights and equal access to the benefits of their society.

===Interfaith Social Assistance Reform Coalition===
The Interfaith Social Justice Reform Coalition (ISARC) is Ontario's largest interfaith organization dedicated to faith-based approaches to public policy reform in the areas of social justice and poverty eradication.  ISARC has a shared hope to mobilize, facilitate, and empower diverse faith communities to research, educate and advocate for public policy for the elimination of poverty in Ontario.  ISARC's values include human dignity, social equity, mutual responsibility, fiscal fairness, economic equity and environmental sustainability. Since 1986, ISARC has been a leader in mobilizing faith communities to advocate for systemic change in the Province of Ontario, Canada.

===Liberation theology===
{{main|Liberation theology}}
Liberation theology&lt;ref&gt;In the mass media, 'Liberation Theology' can sometimes be used loosely, to refer to a wide variety of activist Christian thought. This article uses the term in the narrow sense outlined here.&lt;/ref&gt; is a movement in [[Christian]] [[theology]] which conveys the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] in terms of a liberation from unjust economic, political, or social conditions. It has been described by proponents as "an interpretation of Christian faith through the poor's suffering, their struggle and hope, and a critique of society and the Catholic faith and Christianity through the eyes of the poor",&lt;ref&gt;[[Phillip Berryman|Berryman, Phillip]], ''Liberation Theology: essential facts about the revolutionary movement in Latin America and beyond''(1987)&lt;/ref&gt; and by detractors as Christianity perverted by [[Marxism]] and [[Communism]].&lt;ref&gt;"[David] Horowitz first describes liberation theology as 'a form of Marxised Christianity,' which has validity despite the awkward phrasing, but then he calls it a form of 'Marxist-Leninist ideology,' which is simply not true for most liberation theology..." Robert Shaffer, "[http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2007nov/shaffer.html Acceptable Bounds of Academic Discourse]," Organization of American Historians Newsletter 35, November, 2007. URL retrieved 12 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although liberation theology has grown into an international and inter-denominational movement, it began as a movement within the [[Catholic Church]] in Latin America in the 1950s – 1960s. It arose principally as a moral reaction to the poverty caused by [[social injustice]] in that region. It achieved prominence in the 1970s and 1980s. The term was coined by the [[Peruvian]] priest, [[Gustavo Gutiérrez]], who wrote one of the movement's most famous books, ''A Theology of Liberation'' (1971). According to [[Sarah Kleeb]], "Marx would surely take issue," she writes, "with the appropriation of his works in a religious context...there is no way to reconcile Marx's views of religion with those of Gutierrez, they are simply incompatible.  Despite this, in terms of their understanding of the necessity of a just and righteous world, and the nearly inevitable obstructions along such a path, the two have much in common; and, particularly in the first edition of [A Theology of Liberation], the use of Marxian theory is quite evident."&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Kleeb, "[http://www.academia.edu/172232/Envisioning_Emancipation_Karl_Marx_Gustavo_Gutierrez_and_the_Struggle_of_Liberation_Theology Envisioning Emancipation: Karl Marx, Gustavo Gutierrez, and the Struggle of Liberation Theology]"; Presented at the Annual Meeting of the Canadian Society for the Study of Religion (CSSR), Toronto, 2006.

McBrien, ''Catholicism'' (Harper Collins, 1994), chapter IV.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gustavo Gutierrez, ''A Theology of Liberation'', First (Spanish) edition published in Lima, Peru, 1971; first English edition published by Orbis Books (Maryknoll, New York), 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social justice in healthcare===
Social justice has more recently made its way into the field of [[bioethics]]. Discussion involves topics such as affordable access to health care, especially for low income households and families. The discussion also raises questions such as whether society should bear healthcare costs for low income families, and whether the global marketplace is a good thing to deal with healthcare. [[Ruth Faden]] and Madison Powers of the [[Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics]] focus their analysis of social justice on which inequalities matter the most. They develop a social justice theory that answers some of these questions in concrete settings.
Social injustices occur when there is a preventable difference in health states among a population of people. These social injustices take on the form of health inequities when negative health states such as malnourishment, and infectious diseases are more prevalent among an impoverished nation.&lt;ref&gt;Farmer, Paul E., Bruce Nizeye, Sara Stulac, and Salmaan Keshavjee. 2006. Structural Violence and Clinical Medicine. PLoS Medicine, 1686-1691&lt;/ref&gt; These negative health states can often be prevented by providing social and economic structures such as Primary Healthcare which ensure the general population has equal access to health care services regardless of income level, gender, education or any other stratifying factor. Integrating social justice to health inherently reflects the social determinants of health model without discounting the role of the bio-medical model.&lt;ref&gt;Cueto, Marcos. 2004. The ORIGINS of Primary Health Care and SELECTIVE Primary Health Care. Am J Public Health 94 (11):1868&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social justice and human rights education===
{{Main|Human rights education}}
The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] affirm that "Human rights education should include peace, democracy, development and social justice, as set forth in [[international human rights instruments|international and regional human rights instruments]], in order to achieve common understanding and awareness with a view to strengthening universal commitment to human rights."&lt;ref&gt;Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, Part II, paragraph 80&lt;/ref&gt;
