Most variations on the concept hold that as governments are instituted among populations for the benefit of members of those populations, those governments which fail to see to the welfare of their citizens are failing to uphold their part in the social contract and are, therefore, unjust. The concept usually includes, but is not limited to, upholding [[human rights]]; many variants also contain some statements concerning more equitable distributions of wealth and resources.

The term "social justice" is generally so phrased in order to distinguish this particular concept from concepts of [[justice]] in [[law]] &amp;mdash; some of which, according to their critics, are decidedly unjust in a social sense &amp;mdash; and from concepts of justice as embedded in systems of [[morality]] which may differ between cultures.  

Social justice refers to the overall fairness of a society in its divisions of rewards and burdens.

"Social Justice" is also one of the [[Four Pillars of the Green Party]] upheld by the [[worldwide green parties]]. As stated by several local branches, this is the principle that all persons are entitled to "basic human needs", regardless of "superficial differences such as economic disparity, class, gender, race, ethnicity, citizenship, religion, age, sexual orientation, disability, or health". This includes the eradication of poverty and illiteracy, the establishment of sound environmental policy, and equality of opportunity for healthy personal and social development.
