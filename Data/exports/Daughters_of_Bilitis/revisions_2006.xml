This edition is from May 1966.]]

The '''Daughters of Bilitis''' ('''DOB''') was formed in [[San Francisco, California]] in [[1955]] by [[Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon]] along with six other women. The author [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]] was a member of the group in the 1950s. The group was conceived as a social alternative to lesbian bars, which were considered illegal and thus subject to raids and police harassment. Lyon and Martin claim that they had no knowledge of the male-oriented [[homophile]] groups, such as the [[Mattachine Society]], when they first established the organization in 1955.

"Daughters" was meant to evoke association with other American sororal associations such as the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]], the [[Daughters of the Republic of Texas]], and the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]].  "Bilitis" is the name given to a fictional lesbian contemporary of [[Sappho]], by the French poet [[Pierre Lou√øs]] in his [[1894]] work ''[[The Songs of Bilitis]]''.

The regular DOB publication was called ''[[The Ladder (magazine)|The Ladder]]'', started in [[1956]] with the help of [[ONE, Inc.]] and the [[Mattachine Society]], with whom the DOB retained friendly relations.  In [[1970]] the mailing-lists and production facilities for ''The Ladder'' were secretly seized and relocated by [[separatism|separatist]] feminists, and as a consequence the magazine ceased publication in [[1972]]. The name of the journal refers to [[Plato]]'s pedagogic hierarchy, "the ladder of beauty".

DOB was influential throughout the 1950s and 1960s but was torn apart by factionalism in the 1970s.  Its members split over whether to give more support to the [[gay rights]] movement or to [[feminism]].  One chapter of DOB survives to this day in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].
