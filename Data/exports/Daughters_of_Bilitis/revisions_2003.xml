It was conceived as an explicitly [[lesbian]] alternative to other [[homophile]] groups of that era.  “Daughters” was meant to evoke association with other American sororal associations such as the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]], the [[Daughters of the Republic of Texas]], and the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]].  “Bilitis” is the name given to a fictional lesbian lover of [[Sappho]] by the French poet [[Pierre Lou&amp;yuml;s]] in his 1894 work ''The Songs of Bilitis''.

DOB was influential throughout the 1950s and 1960s but was torn apart by factionalism in the 1970s.  Its members split over whether to give more support to the [[gay rights movement]] or to [[feminism]].  One chapter of DOB survives to this day in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].</rev></revisions></page></pages></query></api>
