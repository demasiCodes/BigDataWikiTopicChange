The author [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]] was a member of the group in the 1950s. It was conceived as an explicitly [[lesbian]] alternative to other [[homophile]] groups of that era such as the [[Mattachine Society]].

"Daughters" was meant to evoke association with other American sororal associations such as the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]], the [[Daughters of the Republic of Texas]], and the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]].  "Bilitis" is the name given to a lesbian contemporary of [[Sappho]], by the French poet [[Pierre Lou√øs]] in his [[1894]] work ''[[The Songs of Bilitis]]''.

The regular DOB publication was called ''The Ladder'', started in [[1956]] with the help of [[ONE, Inc.]] and the [[Mattachine Society]], with whom the DOB retained friendly relations.  In [[1970]] the mailing-lists and production facilities for ''The Ladder'' were secretly seized and relocated by [[separatism|separatist]] feminists, and as a consequence the magazine ceased publication in [[1972]]. The name of the journal refers to [[Plato]]'s pedagogic hierarchy, "the ladder of beauty".

DOB was influential throughout the 1950s and 1960s but was torn apart by factionalism in the 1970s.  Its members split over whether to give more support to the [[gay rights]] movement or to [[feminism]].  One chapter of DOB survives to this day in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].
