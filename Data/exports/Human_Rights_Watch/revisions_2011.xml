'''Human Rights Watch''' is an international [[non-governmental organization]] that conducts research and [[advocacy]] on [[human rights]]. Its headquarters are in [[New York City]] and it has offices in [[Berlin]], [[Beirut]], [[Brussels]], [[Chicago]], [[Geneva]], [[Johannesburg]], [[London]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Moscow]], [[Paris]], [[San Francisco]], [[Tokyo]], [[Toronto]], and [[Washington D.C.|Washington]].&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/node/75138|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|Helsinki Watch}}
Human Rights Watch was founded as a private American [[NGO]] in 1978, under the name of [[Helsinki Watch]], to monitor the former [[Soviet Union]]'s compliance with the [[Helsinki Accords]].&lt;ref name="OH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/node/75134|title=Our History |publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helsinki Watch adopted a methodology of publicly "naming and shaming" abusive governments through media coverage and through direct exchanges with policymakers. By shining the international spotlight on human rights violations in the Soviet Union and its [[vassal state]]s in [[Eastern Europe]], Helsinki Watch contributed to the democratic transformations of the region in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="OH" /&gt;

'''Americas Watch''' was founded in 1981 while bloody civil wars engulfed [[Central America]]. Relying on extensive on-the-ground fact-finding, Americas Watch not only addressed perceived abuses by government forces but also applied [[international humanitarian law]] to investigate and expose [[war crime]]s by rebel groups. In addition to raising its concerns in the affected countries, Americas Watch also examined the role played by foreign governments, particularly the [[United States government]], in providing military and political support to abusive regimes.

'''Asia Watch''' (1985), '''Africa Watch''' (1988), and '''Middle East Watch''' (1989) were added to what was then known as "'''The Watch Committees'''." In 1988, all of the committees were united under one umbrella to form Human Rights Watch.

== Profile ==
Pursuant to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], Human Rights Watch opposes violations of what it considers basic human rights, which include [[capital punishment]] and discrimination on the basis of [[LGBT social movements|sexual orientation]]. Human Rights Watch advocates freedoms in connection with fundamental human rights, such as [[freedom of religion]] and [[freedom of the press|the press]].

Human Rights Watch produces research reports on violations of [[international human rights law|international human rights norms]] as set out by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and what it perceives to be other internationally accepted human rights norms. These reports are used as the basis for drawing international attention to abuses and pressuring governments and international organizations to reform. Researchers conduct fact-finding missions to investigate suspect situations and generate coverage in local and international [[News media|media]]. Issues raised by Human Rights Watch in its reports include social and [[discrimination|gender discrimination]], [[torture]], [[military use of children]], [[political corruption]], abuses in [[criminal justice]] systems, and the legalization of [[abortion]].&lt;ref name="OH" /&gt; Human Rights Watch documents and reports violations of the laws of [[war]] and international humanitarian law.

Human Rights Watch also supports writers worldwide who are being persecuted for their work and are in need of [[financial assistance]]. The Hellman/Hammett grants are financed by the estate of the playwright [[Lillian Hellman]] in funds set up in her name and that of her long-time companion, the novelist [[Dashiell Hammett]]. In addition to providing financial assistance, the Hellman/Hammett grants help raise international awareness of activists who are being silenced for speaking out in defence of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/about/info/helham.html Hellman-Hammett Grants],''Human Rights Watch''&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, Human Rights Watch presents the Human Rights Defenders Award to activists around the world who demonstrate leadership and courage in defending human rights. The award winners work closely with Human Rights Watch in investigating and exposing human rights abuses.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Human Rights Watch was one of six international NGOs that founded the [[Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers]] in 1998. It is also the co-chair of the [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]], a global coalition of civil society groups that successfully lobbied to introduce the [[Ottawa Treaty]], a treaty that prohibits the use of anti-personnel landmines.

Human Rights Watch is a founding member of the [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]], a global network of [[non-governmental organizations]] that monitor [[censorship]] worldwide. It also co-founded the [[Cluster Munition Coalition]], which brought about an international convention banning the weapons. Human Rights Watch employs more than 275 staff—country experts, lawyers, journalists, and academics – and operates in more than 90 countries around the world.&lt;ref name="WWA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/node/75136|title=Who We Are |publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current executive director of Human Rights Watch is [[Kenneth Roth]], who has held the position since 1993. Roth conducted investigations on abuses in [[Poland]] after martial law was declared 1981. He later focused on [[Haiti]], which had just emerged from the Duvalier dictatorship but continued to be plagued with problems. Roth’s awareness of human rights began with stories that his father told about escaping [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938. He graduated from [[Yale Law School]] and [[Brown University]].

Human Rights Watch has been deemed an accredited charity by the BBB Wise Giving Alliance, a national charity monitoring organization that is associated with the Better Business Bureau system &lt;ref&gt;"Human Rights Watch Meets the BBB Wise Giving Alliance's Standards for Charity Accountability." ''BBB Wise Giving Alliance.'' http://charityreports.bbb.org/public/seal.aspx?ID=34521032010&lt;/ref&gt;. Charity Navigator, an organization that evaluates individual charity institutions and subsequently publishes reports detailing aspects such as income statements and organizational efficiency, gave Human Rights Watch a two out of four-star overall rating &lt;ref&gt;"Charity Rating - Human Rights Watch." ''Charity Navigator - America's Largest Charity Evaluator | Home.''

== Financing and services ==
For the financial year ending June 2008, HRW reported receiving approximately US$44 million in public donations.&lt;ref name="FS-2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/related_material/FinancialStatements2008.pdf|title=Financial Statements. Year Ended June 30, 2008|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Human Rights Watch stated that they receive almost 75% of their financial support from North America, 25% from Western Europe and less than 1% from the rest of the world.&lt;ref name="SA-2009-07"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/node/84512|title=Human Rights Watch Visit to Saudi Arabia |date=2009-07-17|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2008 financial assessment, HRW reports that it does not accept any direct or indirect funding from governments and is financed through contributions from private individuals and foundations.&lt;ref name="Financials"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/09/22/financials|title=Financials |date=2008-09-22|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[NGO Monitor]] this policy is violated by support from the [[Dutch government]] and a May 2009 fund raising trip to [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name="Sponsors"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngo-monitor.org/article/human_rights_watch_hrw_|title=Sponsors |date=2010-11-30|publisher=NGO Monitor|accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, [[billionaire]] financier and philanthropist [[George Soros]] announced in 2010 his intention to donate US$100 million to HRW over a period of ten years. He said, "Human Rights Watch is one of the most effective organizations I support. Human rights underpin our greatest aspirations: they're at the heart of open societies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=187450 Soros to give Human Rights Watch $100m. over 10 years]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost2010-09&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/11/AR2010091105057.html

== Comparison with Amnesty International ==
Human Rights Watch and [[Amnesty International]] are the only two western-oriented international human rights organizations operating worldwide in most situations of severe oppression or abuse.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The major differences lie in the groups’ structure and methods for promoting change.

Amnesty International is a mass-membership organization. Mobilization of those members is the organization's central advocacy tool. Human Rights Watch's main products are its crisis-directed research and lengthy reports, whereas Amnesty lobbies and writes detailed reports, but also focuses on mass letter-writing campaigns, adopting individuals as "[[prisoners of conscience]]" and lobbying for their release. Human Rights Watch will openly lobby for specific actions for other governments to take against human rights offenders, including naming specific individuals for arrest, or for [[International sanctions|sanctions]] to be levied against certain countries, recently calling for punitive sanctions against the top leaders in [[Sudan]] who have overseen a killing campaign in [[Darfur]]. The group has also called for human rights activists who have been detained in Sudan to be released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africa.reuters.com/top/news/usnJOE4AQ00Q.html Human rights group says activists detained in Sudan]&lt;/ref&gt;

Its documentations of human rights abuses often include extensive analysis of the political and historical backgrounds of the conflicts concerned, some of which have been published in academic journals. AI's reports, on the other hand, tend to contain less analysis, and instead focus on specific abuses of rights.

In 2010 ''[[The Times]]'' of London wrote that HRW has "all but eclipsed" Amnesty International.  According to ''The Times'', instead of being supporting by a mass membership, as AI is, HRW depends on wealthy donors who like to see the organization's reports make headlines. For this reason, according, HRW tends to "concentrate too much on places that the media already cares about," especially in disproportionate coverage of Israel.&lt;ref name="Scandal engulfs Human Rights Watch" &gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article7076462.ece?token=null&amp;offset=0&amp;page=1/Nazi scandal engulfs Human Rights Watch] The Sunday Times, March 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=January 2011}}

== Criticism ==
&lt;!-- PLEASE NOTE BEFORE EDITING: This section is for a summary of criticisms of HRW, and therefore must represent each criticism with equal weight. Including the newest news item about HRW does not meet this requirement. That type of material should be placed on the main criticisms article. --&gt;
{{Main|Criticism of Human Rights Watch}}
Human Rights Watch has been criticized in the media and accused of engaging in weak research and propagating false reports. Robert Bernstein, a founder and former chairman of the Human Rights Watch, is one such critic of the organization’s current research practices. In a New York Times [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/opinion/20bernstein.html article], Bernstein condemns the institution for no longer placing emphasis on the distinction between open and closed societies; this, he argues, is particularly discernible in its reports on the Middle East. Bernstein argues that Iran and most Arab regimes are notoriously autocratic and closed. While civil liberties vary across the region, the [[rule of law]] is less common than a [[state of emergency]]. Israel's history of democracy for its citizens includes a free press, elections and a variety of human rights and political organizations. Some argue this means Israel should be held to a higher standard. Bernstein, however, Human Rights Watch's reproaches of Israel for international law violations fail to stress the country's democratic nature. &lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Robert L. "Rights Watchdog, Lost in the Mideast." ''The New York Times - Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia.'' NYTimes.com. http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/opinion/20bernstein.html?_r=1 &lt;/ref&gt;. Bernstein also censures the organization for depending on unreliable sources in its research, claiming that its reporting “often relies on witnesses whose stories cannot be verified and who may testify for political advantage or because they fear retaliation from their own rulers” &lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Robert L. "Rights Watchdog, Lost in the Mideast." ''The New York Times - Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia.'' NYTimes.com. http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/opinion/20bernstein.html?_r=1 &lt;/ref&gt;.. This offense in the institution’s research methods makes it impossible to know where and when international laws are actually being violated.
	Outside of the accusations the Human Rights Watch has received for its poor research practices, the organization is also under strong speculation of using selection bias, particularly regarding Israeli affairs. There has been wide insistence that the organization’s consistently intense coverage of Israeli violations and simultaneous neglect of other human rights abusing regimes is an issue that must be confronted. This apparent bias is particularly evident when comparing the organization’s coverage of Israel to that of Kashmir. The Human Rights Watch has released four reports over the last twenty years on the dissidence in Kashmir, a region known for its wide-scale systematic murders and over 80,000 conflict-related deaths within that time frame. This, compared to the five detailed reports that the institution has issued on Israel within a mere fourteen months &lt;ref&gt;Foreman, Jonathan. "Nazi Scandal Engulfs Human Rights Watch - Times Online." ''The Times | UK News, World News and Opinion''. http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article7076462.ece&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Recent controversies==
{{merge|Criticism of Human Rights Watch|date=February 2011}}

[[Robert L. Bernstein]], a founder and former chairman of HRW, argued in October 2009 that "Human Rights Watch has lost critical perspective" on events in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name="Bernstein_19102009"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/opinion/20bernstein.html?_r=1&amp;em|title=Rights Watchdog, Lost in the Mideast|last=Bernstein|first=Robert L.|date=2009-10-19|publisher=The NY Times|accessdate=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernstein argued that "[t]he region is populated by authoritarian regimes with appalling human rights records. Yet in recent years Human Rights Watch has written far more condemnations of Israel for violations of international law than of any other country in the region."&lt;ref name="Bernstein_19102009"/&gt; Tom Porteus, director of the London branch of Human Rights Watch, replied that the organization rejected Bernstein's "obvious double standard. Any credible human rights organisation must apply the same human rights standards to all countries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/oct/30/human-rights-watch-ngo-monitor ''The Guardian'': Credible approach on human rights]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Strong criticism against Human Rights Watch was caused by the Organization's declarations in favour of [[CIA]] illegal actions of [[Extraordinary rendition by the United States|Extraordinary rendition]] towards suspected terrorists. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-hayden/cia-secret-rendition-poli_b_162916.html CIA Secret Rendition Policy Backed by Human Rights Groups?], ''The Huffington Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

Human Rights Watch made headlines in September 2009 when its Middle East military analyst, [[Marc Garlasco]] who led investigations into Israeli wars in [[Lebanon]] and [[Gaza]], was found posing on the internet dressed in a sweat shirt with a German [[Iron Cross]]. After pressure from the media HRW suspended Marc with pay pending an investigation. Several media reports highlighted his interest in [[World War II]] artifacts&lt;ref name="Huff-2009-09-11"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marc-garlasco/human-rights-watch-invest_b_284075.html|title=Responding to Accusations|last=Garlasco
|first=Marc|date=2009-09-11|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2009-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accused him of collecting [[Nazi]] memorabilia.&lt;ref name="israelis_see_NYT"&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/15/world/middleeast/15nazi.html?hp Israelis See Clear Bias in Activist], New York Times, John Schwartz, September 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/15/human-rights-watch-nazi-israel|title=Human Rights Watch investigator suspended over Nazi memorabilia|last=Pilkington|first=Ed|date=2009-09-15|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2010-02-15}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Garlasco has said that the allegations of Nazi sympathies were "defamatory nonsense, spread maliciously by people with an interest in trying to undermine Human Rights Watch's reporting."&lt;ref name="Huff-2009-09-11"/&gt; HRW has said the charges leveled against Garlasco are "demonstrably false" and fit "into a campaign to deflect attention from Human Rights Watch's rigorous and detailed reporting on violations of international human rights and humanitarian law by the Israeli government".&lt;ref name="HRW-2009-09-10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/node/85545|title=Protecting Civilians: Military Expert Marc Garlasco
|date=2009-09-10|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In February 2011, HRW appointed Shawan Jabarin to their Mideast Advisory Board. Jabarin is a very controversial figure, labeled "[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]" by the Israeli [[Supreme Court]], for his dual roles in both the terrorist organization [[PFLP]], and the human rights organization, [[Al Haq]]. HRW’s decision to include Jabarin on its Mideast Board sparked criticism from [[Robert L. Bernstein]], a founder of HRW, Stuart Robinowitz, a prominent New York attorney who has undertaken human-rights missions for the [[American Bar Association]] and [[Helsinki Watch]] (the predecessor to HRW) in Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and El Salvador, and Prof. [[Gerald Steinberg]], the president of the Jerusalem-based [[NGO Monitor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=208768 HRW appoints alleged terrorist to Mideast Board]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Los Angeles Times op-ed, February 24, 2011, after the [[Libyan civil war]] intensified, [[Sarah Leah Whitson]], head of the Middle East and North Africa division of HRW, acknowledged the absence of human rights reforms in Libya and said “With no progress on any institutional or legal reforms. For sure, most Libyans we spoke with never had much faith that Moammar Qaddafi would learn new tricks, or that the announced reforms were anything more than an endless loop of promises made and broken.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/24/opinion/la-oe-whitson-libya-20110224 Libya: To oust a tyrant]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeffrey Goldberg]], writing in the [[Atlantic Monthly]], took Whitson to task for her having had "something of a soft spot" for Qaddafi and his son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/02/giving-qaddafi-the-benefit-of-the-doubt/71782/ Giving Qaddafi the Benefit of the Doubt]&lt;/ref&gt;
