'''Human Rights Watch''' is a [[United States]]-based international [[non-governmental organization]] that conducts research and advocacy on [[human rights]]. Its headquarters is in [[New York City]].

==Profile==
Human Rights Watch produces research reports on violations of international human rights norms as set out by the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and other internationally-accepted human rights norms. This is intended to draw international attention to abuses and to put pressure on governments and international organizations to reform. Researchers conduct fact-finding missions to investigate suspect situations and generate coverage in local and international [[News media|media]]. Issues raised by Human Rights Watch in its reports include social and [[discrimination|gender discrimination]], [[torture]], [[military use of children]], [[political corruption]], and abuses in [[criminal justice]] systems. Human Rights Watch documents and reports violations of the laws of [[war]] and international humanitarian law.

Human Rights Watch was founded under the name [[Helsinki Watch]] in [[1978]] to monitor the former [[Soviet Union]]'s compliance with the [[Helsinki Accords]]. As the organization grew, it formed other "watch committees" to cover other regions of the world. In [[1988]], all of the committees were united under one umbrella to form Human Rights Watch. One of the original founders and a president of the organization was [[Robert L. Bernstein]].

Human Rights Watch was one of six international NGOs that founded the [[Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers]] in [[1998]]. It is also the co-chair of the [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]], a global coalition of civil society groups that successfully lobbied to introduce the [[Ottawa Convention]], a treaty that prohibits the use of anti-personnel landmines.

Each year, Human Rights Watch gives grants to writers worldwide who are in financial need and who they consider to have been victims of persecution. The Hellman/Hammett grants are financed by the estate of the playwright [[Lillian Hellman]] in funds set up in her name and that of her long-time companion, the novelist [[Dashiell Hammett]]. In addition to providing financial assistance, the Hellman/Hammett grants attempt to raise awareness of censorship &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/about/info/helham.html Hellman-Hammett Grants],''Human Rights Watch''&lt;/ref&gt;.

Pursuant to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], Human Rights Watch opposes violations of basic human rights, including the [[death penalty]] and discrimination on the basis of [[gay rights|sexual orientation]].  Human Rights Watch advocates freedoms in connection with fundamental human rights, such as [[freedom of religion]] and [[freedom of the press|the press]].

Human Rights Watch is a founding member of the [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]], a global network of [[non-governmental organizations]] that monitor [[censorship]] worldwide.

Human Rights Watch has more than 230 paid staff, and a budget of over US$30 million a year.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/annual-report/finStmt2006.pdf Financial statement],''Human Rights Watch''&lt;/ref&gt;

The current executive director of Human Rights Watch is Kenneth Roth. He has held this position since 1993. Roth is a graduate of [[Yale Law School]] and [[Brown University]]. His father fled Nazi [[Germany]] in 1938. Roth started working on human rights after the declaration of martial law in [[Poland]] in 1981, and later became engaged in [[Haiti]] issues. &lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/about/bios/kroth.htm Kenneth Roth Bio],''Human Rights Watch''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent==
Human Rights Watch made recent headlines by criticizing the [[Jordan|Jordanian government]] for arresting elected officials who praised [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], the head of [[Al Qaeda in Iraq]], at ceremonies held in response to his death.  Human Rights Watch also spoke out against the [[Mass murder#Mass murder by a state|mass killings]] and government-imposed [[famine]]s during the last decade of former [[Iraq|Iraqi]] leader [[Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein's]] [[History of Iraq#Under Saddam|rule]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/doc?t=mideast&amp;c=iraq&amp;document_limit=260,20 Middle east and North Africa],''Human Rights Watch''&lt;/ref&gt;.
On July 26th 2007 HRW denounced that hundreds of migrant children held in emergency centers in the Spanish [[Canary Islands]] are living in [http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/07/26/spain16449.htm squalid, overcrowded conditions]and face the risk of abuse from their custodians and other children. The [[Canary Islands government]], which runs the facilities, replied in a statement &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/07/26/asia/abuse.php Human Rights Watch says migrant children are at risk in Canary Islands],''International Herald Tribune''&lt;/ref&gt; that the report lacked "rigor" and that "an internal investigation had failed to corroborate" Human Rights Watch's findings.

==Publications==
[[Image:HRW-WR 2007 Cover.jpg|thumb|250px|Human Rights Watch World Report 2007]]
Human Rights Watch publishes reports on several topics &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/doc/?t=pubs Publications],''Human Rights Watch''&lt;/ref&gt; and compiles annual reports ("World Report") presenting an overview of the worldwide state of human rights.

Human Rights Watch has published extensively on the [[Rwandan Genocide]] of 1994 &lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/doc?t=africa&amp;c=rwanda Rwandan genocide report],''Human Rights Watch''&lt;/ref&gt; and the conflicts in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/doc?t=africa&amp;c=congo Congo report],''Human Rights Watch''&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Comparison with Amnesty International==
Human Rights Watch and [[Amnesty International]] are the only two international human rights organizations operating worldwide in most situations of severe repression or abuse. Though close allies, the two groups play complementary roles, reflecting a division of labour. The major differences lie in the groups’ structure and methods for promoting change.

Amnesty International is a mass-membership organization. Mobilization of those members is the organization's central advocacy tool. Human Rights Watch's main products are its crisis-directed research and lengthy reports, whereas Amnesty lobbies and writes detailed reports, but also focuses on mass letter-writing campaigns, adopting individuals as "prisoners of conscience" and lobbying for their release. Human Rights Watch will openly lobby for specific actions for other governments to take against human rights offenders, including naming specific individuals for arrest, or for [[International sanctions|sanctions]] to be levied against certain countries, recently calling for punitive sanctions against the top leaders in [[Sudan]] who have overseen a killing campaign in [[Darfur]].

Its documentations of human rights abuses often include extensive analyses of the political and historical backgrounds of the conflicts concerned, some of which have been published in academic journals. AI's reports, on the other hand, tend to contain less analysis, and instead focus on specific abuses of rights.

==Criticisms==
{{main|Criticism of Human Rights Watch}}

Human Rights Watch has been criticized for perceived anti-Western, anti-India, anti-China, and anti-Israel bias; at the same time, others have criticized it for having a pro-Western bias. According to a report in the Egyptian press, "the government often accuses human rights groups [including Human Rights Watch] of importing a Western agenda that offends local religious and cultural values."&lt;ref&gt;http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/680/eg9.htm Not just the Queen Boat: HRW is asking the Egyptian government to stop persecuting homosexuals and commit to reform]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the reports on the Gujarat riots compiled by Human Rights Watch have been criticized by Arvin Bahl, a guest contributor to the "[[South Asia Analysis Group]]", as "one-sided" and "biased" against [[Hindu]]s. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saag.org/papers9/paper891.html Politics By Other Means: An Analysis of Human Rights Watch Reports on India],saag.org&lt;/ref&gt;
