The organization was started under the name [[Helsinki Watch]] in [[1978]] to monitor the [[Soviet Union]]'s compliance with the [[Helsinki Accords]]. Other watch organizations were started to cover other parts of the world. They were united in [[1988]] and formed Human Rights Watch.

Whereas most other groups are focused on [[advocacy]] and [[public pressure]], HRW's specialty is the production of [[report]]s, to establish the details needed for others to do advocacy work. Major issues raised by the organization in its reports include social and gender discrimination, government corruption, and abuses in criminal justice systems in many nations. 

Human Rights Watch was one of six international NGOs that founded the [[Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers]] in [[1998]].

Like most human rights groups, Human Rights Watch opposes the [[death penalty]].
