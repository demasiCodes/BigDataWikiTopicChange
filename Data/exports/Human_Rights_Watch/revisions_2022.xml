'''Human Rights Watch''' ('''HRW''') is an international [[non-governmental organization]], headquartered in New York City, that conducts research and [[advocacy]] on [[human rights]].&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/node/75138|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Human Rights Watch|access-date=January 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104193654/http://www.hrw.org/node/75138|archive-date=January 4, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group pressures governments, policy makers, companies, and individual human rights abusers to denounce abuse and respect human rights, and the group often works on behalf of refugees, children, migrants, and political prisoners.

Human Rights Watch, in 1997, shared the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] as a founding member of the [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]], and it played a leading role in the [[2008 treaty banning cluster munitions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/history|title=History |work=www.hrw.org |date=April 21, 2015|access-date=May 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508233353/https://www.hrw.org/history|archive-date=May 8, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By shining the international spotlight on human rights violations in the Soviet Union and its European partners, Helsinki Watch says it contributed to the [[democracy|democratic]] transformations of the region in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="OH"/&gt;

'''Americas Watch''' was founded in 1981 while bloody [[civil war]]s engulfed Central America. Relying on extensive on-the-ground fact-finding, Americas Watch not only addressed perceived abuses by government forces but also applied [[international humanitarian law]] to investigate and expose [[war crime]]s by rebel groups. In addition to raising its concerns in the affected countries, Americas Watch also examined the role played by foreign governments, particularly the [[United States government]], in providing military and political support to abusive regimes.

'''Asia Watch''' (1985), '''Africa Watch''' (1988) and '''Middle East Watch''' (1989) were added to what was known as "'''The Watch Committees'''". In 1988, all of these committees were united under one umbrella to form Human Rights Watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=https://www.hrw.org/node/75134|agency=Human Rights Watch (HRW.org)|access-date=February 28, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140206203626/http://www.hrw.org/node/75134|archive-date=February 6, 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Chauhan|first=Yamini|title=Human Rights Watch|url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1459072/Human-Rights-Watch|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=March 2, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202231513/https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1459072/Human-Rights-Watch|archive-date=December 2, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Primary sources|section|date=September 2017}}
Pursuant to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), Human Rights Watch (HRW) opposes violations of what are considered [[basic human rights]] under the UDHR. This includes [[capital punishment]] and [[discrimination]] on the basis of [[LGBT social movements|sexual orientation]]. HRW advocates freedoms in connection with fundamental human rights, such as [[freedom of religion]] and [[freedom of the press]]. HRW seeks to achieve change by publicly pressuring governments and their policymakers to curb human rights abuses, and by convincing more powerful governments to use their influence on governments that violate human rights.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Human Rights and Humanitarian Organizations''; Edited by Thomas E. Doyle, Robert F. Gorman, Edward S. Mihalkanin; Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2016; Pg. 137-138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;

Human Rights Watch publishes research reports on violations of [[international human rights law|international human rights norms]] as set out by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and what it perceives to be other internationally accepted, human-rights norms. These reports are used as the basis for drawing international attention to abuses and pressuring governments and international organizations to reform. Researchers conduct fact-finding missions to investigate suspect situations also using diplomacy, staying in touch with victims, making files about public and individuals, and providing required security for them in critical situations and in a proper time generate coverage in local and international media. Issues raised by Human Rights Watch in its reports include social and [[discrimination|gender discrimination]], [[torture]], [[military use of children]], [[political corruption]], abuses in [[criminal justice]] systems, and the legalization of [[abortion]].&lt;ref name="OH"/&gt; HRW has documented and reported various violations of the laws of war and [[international humanitarian law]], mostly recently in the Yemen. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Roth|first=Kenneth|date=October 2021|title=World Report 2021:Yemen|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2021/country-chapters/yemen|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210113175015/https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2021/country-chapters/yemen|archive-date=January 13, 2021|access-date=March 27, 2022|website=HRW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human Rights Watch also supports writers worldwide, who are being persecuted for their work and are in need of [[Welfare (financial aid)|financial assistance]]. The Hellman/Hammett grants are financed by the estate of the playwright [[Lillian Hellman]] in funds set up in her name and that of her long-time companion, the novelist [[Dashiell Hammett]]. In addition to providing financial assistance, the Hellman/Hammett grants help raise international awareness of activists who are being silenced for speaking out in defence of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/about/info/helham.html Hellman-Hammett Grants] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001004193120/http://www.hrw.org/about/info/helham.html |date=October 4, 2000 }}, ''Human Rights Watch''&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, Human Rights Watch presents the [[Human Rights Defenders Award]] to activists around the world who demonstrate leadership and courage in defending human rights. The award winners work closely with HRW in investigating and exposing human rights abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Activists Win Human Rights Watch Awards|date=September 15, 2008|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2008/09/14/five-activists-win-human-rights-watch-awards|publisher=Human Rights Watch|access-date=February 23, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310131735/http://www.hrw.org/news/2008/09/14/five-activists-win-human-rights-watch-awards|archive-date=March 10, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SocialSciences.in"&gt;{{cite web|work=SocialSciences.in|title=Human Rights Watch|url=http://socialsciences.in/article/human-rights-watch|access-date=February 23, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915100739/http://www.socialsciences.in/article/human-rights-watch|archive-date=September 15, 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human Rights Watch was one of six international NGOs that founded the [[Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers]] in 1998. It is also the co-chair of the [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]], a global coalition of civil society groups that successfully lobbied to introduce the [[Ottawa Treaty]], a treaty that prohibits the use of anti-personnel landmines.

Human Rights Watch is a founding member of the [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]], a global network of [[non-governmental organizations]] that monitor [[censorship]] worldwide. It also co-founded the [[Cluster Munition Coalition]], which brought about an international convention banning the weapons. HRW employs more than 275 staff—country experts, lawyers, journalists, and academics—and operates in more than 90 countries around the world. Headquartered in [[New York City]], it has offices in [[Amsterdam]], [[Beirut]], [[Berlin]], [[Brussels]], [[Chicago]], [[Geneva]], [[Johannesburg]], [[London]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Nairobi]], [[Seoul]], [[Paris]], [[San Francisco]], [[Sydney]], [[Tokyo]], [[Toronto]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Zürich]].&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WWA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/node/75136|title=Who We Are|publisher=Human Rights Watch|access-date=July 23, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724075720/http://www.hrw.org/en/node/75136|archive-date=July 24, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; HRW maintains direct access to the majority of countries it reports on. [[Cuba]], [[North Korea]], [[Sudan]], [[Iran]], [[Israel]], [[Egypt]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Venezuela]] are among the handful of countries that have blocked access for HRW staff members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-rights/israel-bans-human-right-watch-worker-accuses-group-of-peddling-pro-palestinian-line-idUSKBN16313N|title=Israel bans Human Right Watch worker, accuses group of peddling... |last=Lewis |first=Ori |work=U.S. |access-date=May 30, 2018 |language=en-US |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719233752/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-rights/israel-bans-human-right-watch-worker-accuses-group-of-peddling-pro-palestinian-line-idUSKBN16313N|archive-date=July 19, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2022, the executive director of HRW is [[Kenneth Roth]], who has held the position since 1993. Roth conducted investigations on abuses in [[Poland]] after martial law was declared 1981. He later focused on [[Haiti]], which had just emerged from the [[Duvalier dictatorship]] but continued to be plagued with problems. Roth's awareness of the importance of human rights began with stories his father had told about escaping [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938. Roth graduated from [[Yale Law School]] and [[Brown University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://law.yale.edu/yls-today/yale-law-school-events/national-security-turbulent-world|title=National Security in a Turbulent World - Yale Law School|website=law.yale.edu|access-date=April 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191227044547/https://law.yale.edu/yls-today/yale-law-school-events/national-security-turbulent-world|archive-date=December 27, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparison with Amnesty International ===
Human Rights Watch and [[Amnesty International]] are the only two Western-oriented{{dubious|date=February 2022|reason=led [[Pierre Sané]] from Senegal 1992–2001; [[Irene Khan]] from Bangladesh 2001–2010; [[Salil Shetty]] from India 2010–2018; [[Kumi Naidoo]] from South Africa 2018–2020}} non-governmental, international human rights organizations whose reports on human rights violations aim for comprehensive global coverage.&lt;ref name="SocialSciences.in"/&gt; The major differences lie in the group's structure and methods for promoting change.

Amnesty International is a mass-membership organization. Mobilization of those members is the organization's central advocacy tool. Human Rights Watch's main products are its crisis-directed research and lengthy reports, whereas Amnesty International lobbies and writes detailed reports, but also focuses on mass letter-writing campaigns, adopting individuals as "[[prisoners of conscience]]" and lobbying for their release. Human Rights Watch will openly lobby for specific actions for other governments to take against human rights offenders, including naming specific individuals for arrest, or for [[International sanctions|sanctions]] to be levied against certain countries, such as calling for punitive sanctions against the top leaders in [[Sudan]] who oversaw a killing campaign in [[Darfur]]. The group also called for human rights activists who had been detained in Sudan to be released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africa.reuters.com/top/news/usnJOE4AQ00Q.html|title=Reuters.com|website=arquivo.pt|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109190851/http://africa.reuters.com/top/news/usnJOE4AQ00Q.html|archive-date=January 9, 2009}}{{failed verification|date=June 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its documentations of human rights abuses often include extensive analyses of the political and historical backgrounds of the conflicts concerned, some of which have been published in academic journals. AI's reports, on the other hand, tend to contain less analyses, and instead focus on specific abuses of rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Wiley-Blackwell encyclopedia of globalization|date=2012|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|others=Ritzer, George., Wiley-Blackwell (Firm)|isbn=9781405188241|location=Chichester, West Sussex|oclc=748577872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Jonathan Foreman (journalist)|Jonathan Foreman]] wrote that HRW has "all but eclipsed" Amnesty International. According to Foreman, instead of being supported by a mass membership, as AI is, HRW depends on wealthy donors who like to see the organization's reports make headlines. For this reason, according to Foremen, it may be that organizations like HRW "concentrate too much on places that the media already cares about", especially in disproportionate coverage of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Jonathan Foreman | newspaper = [[The Sunday Times]] | date = March 28, 2010 | title = Explosive Territory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financing and services ==
For the financial year ending June 2008, HRW reported receiving approximately US$44 million in public donations.&lt;ref name="FS-2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/related_material/FinancialStatements2008.pdf|title=Financial Statements.

According to a 2008 financial assessment, HRW reports that it does not accept any direct or indirect funding from governments and is financed through contributions from private individuals and foundations.&lt;ref name="Financials"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/09/22/financials|title=Financials|date=September 22, 2008|publisher=Human Rights Watch|access-date=July 23, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216204250/http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/09/22/financials|archive-date=February 16, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financier and philanthropist [[George Soros]] of the [[Open Society Foundations]] announced in 2010 his intention to grant US$100 million to HRW over a period of ten years to help it expand its efforts internationally: "to be more effective," he said, "I think the organization has to be seen as more international, less an American organization."

In the summer of 2004, the [[Rare Book and Manuscript Library]] at [[Columbia University]] in New York became the depository institution for the Human Rights Watch Archive, an active collection that documents decades of human rights investigations around the world. The archive was transferred from its previous location at the Norlin Library at the [[University of Colorado, Boulder]]. The archive includes administrative files, public relations documents, as well as case and country files. With some exceptions for security considerations, the Columbia University community and the public have access to field notes, taped and transcribed interviews with alleged victims of human rights violations, video and audiotapes, and other materials documenting the organization's activities since its founding in 1978 as Helsinki Watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2004/03/ljarchives/human-rights-watch-archive-moves-to-columbia-university/|title=Human Rights Watch Archive Moves to Columbia University|website=lj.libraryjournal.com|access-date=March 29, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714213843/http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2004/03/ljarchives/human-rights-watch-archive-moves-to-columbia-university/|archive-date=July 14, 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, significant parts of the HRW archive are not open to researchers or to the public, including the records of the meetings of the board of directors, the executive committee, and the various subcommittees, limiting historians' ability to understand the organization's internal decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Slezkine, Peter, "[http://humanityjournal.org/issue-5-3/from-helsinki-to-human-rights-watch-how-an-american-cold-war-monitoring-group-became-an-international-human-rights-institution/ From Helsinki to Human Rights Watch] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191227195228/http://humanityjournal.org/issue-5-3/from-helsinki-to-human-rights-watch-how-an-american-cold-war-monitoring-group-became-an-international-human-rights-institution/ |date=2019-12-27 }}," Humanity (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{main|Criticism of Human Rights Watch}}
HRW has been criticized for perceived bias by the national governments it has investigated for human rights abuses,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/world/middleeast/egypt-human-rights-watch-muslim-brotherhood.html After Human Rights Watch Report, Egypt Says Group Broke Law] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620153350/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/world/middleeast/egypt-human-rights-watch-muslim-brotherhood.html |date=2018-06-20 }}".

Bernstein]].&lt;ref name="Bernstein_19102009"/&gt; Bias allegations have included undue influence by United States government policy, and claims that HRW is biased against Israel (and focuses undue attention on the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Friedman|first1=Matti|title=What the Media Gets Wrong About Israel|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/11/how-the-media-makes-the-israel-story/383262/3/|date=November 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; HRW has also been criticized for poor research methodology and lax fact-checking, and ignoring the human-rights abuses of less-open regimes. HRW has routinely publicly addressed, and often denies, criticism of its reporting and findings.&lt;ref name="Knuckey"&gt;''The Transformation of Human Rights Fact-Finding''; Sarah Knuckey; [[Oxford University Press]], 2015; Pgs. 355-376&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Democracy Now, HRW has also been criticized for having a 'revolving door' with the U.S. government, a charge which HRW disputes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.democracynow.org/2014/6/11/debate_is_human_rights_watch_too Is Human Rights Watch Too Close to U.S. Gov't to Criticize Its Foreign Policy?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191018002942/https://www.democracynow.org/2014/6/11/debate_is_human_rights_watch_too |date=October 18, 2019 }}; June 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2020, the HRW Board of Directors discovered that Human Rights Watch accepted a $470,000 donation from Saudi real estate magnate Mohamed Bin Issa Al Jaber, owner of a company HRW "had previously identified as complicit in labor rights abuse", under the condition that the donation not be used to support LGBT advocacy in the Middle East and North Africa. The gift was returned and Human Rights Watch issued a statement saying that accepting the funding was a "deeply regrettable decision" in response to investigative reporting from The Intercept regarding the donation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2020/03/02/human-rights-watch-took-money-from-saudi-businessman-after-documenting-his-coercive-labor-practices/|title=Human Rights Watch Took Money From Saudi Businessman After Documenting His Coercive Labor Practices|first=Alex|last=Emmons|date=March 2, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2020, HRW executive director Kenneth Roth was sanctioned—together with the heads of four other U.S.-based democracy and human rights organizations and six U.S. Republican lawmakers—by the Chinese government for supporting the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement in the [[2019–20 Hong Kong protests]]. The leaders of the five organizations saw the sanctioning, whose details were unspecified, as a tit-for-tat measure in response to the earlier sanctioning by the U.S. of 11 Hong Kong officials. The latter step had in turn been a reaction to the enactment of the [[Hong Kong National Security Law]] at the end of June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-democracy-and-human-rights-leaders-sanctioned-by-china-vow-not-to-be-cowed-into-silence/2020/08/10/0878f65a-db48-11ea-b4af-72895e22941d_story.html|title=U.S. democracy and human rights leaders sanctioned by China vow not to be cowed into silence|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|first=Carol|last=Morello|date=August 11, 2020|access-date=January 11, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported in October 2021 that HRW left Hong Kong as a result of the Chinese sanctions, with the situation in Hong Kong henceforth to be monitored by the China team of HRW. The decision to leave came amid a wider crackdown on civil society groups in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/24/world/asia/hong-kong-civil-society.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211228/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/24/world/asia/hong-kong-civil-society.html |archive-date=2021-12-28 |url-access=limited|title=As Hong Kong's civil society buckles, one group tries to hold on|first=Austin|last=Ramzy|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 24, 2021|access-date=October 25, 2021}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;
