'''Bullying''' is the use of force, threat, or [[coercion]] to [[abuse]], [[intimidate]], or aggressively [[wikt:domination|dominate]] others. The behavior is often repeated and habitual. One essential prerequisite is the perception, by the bully or by others, of an imbalance of [[Power (social and political)|social]] or physical power. Behaviors used to assert such domination can include verbal [[harassment]] or [[threat]], physical [[assault]] or coercion, and such acts may be directed repeatedly towards particular targets. Justifications and [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalizations]] for such behavior sometimes include differences of [[social class]], [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], [[religion]], [[gender]], [[sexual orientation]], [[human physical appearance|appearance]], [[Eccentricity (behavior)|behavior]], [[body language]], [[personality]], [[reputation]], [[Pedigree chart#In human use|lineage]], strength, size or [[disability|ability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Children who are bullying or being bullied | work = Cambridgeshire County Council: Children and families | publisher =Cambridgeshire County Council | date =2013-07-24 | url = http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/childrenandfamilies/parenting/childsbehaviour/bullying.htm | accessdate = 2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Ericson | first =Nels | title =Addressing the Problem of Juvenile Bullying | journal =OJJDP Fact Sheet #FS-200127| volume =27 | publisher =U.S. Department of Justice: Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention | date =June 2001 | url =https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/fs200127.pdf | accessdate = 2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; If bullying is done by a group, it is called [[mobbing]].&lt;ref name="DavenportSchwartz1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Noa Davenport|author2=Ruth Distler Schwartz|author3=Gail Pursell Elliott|title=Mobbing: Emotional Abuse in the American Workplace|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JlJoyD84BfAC|accessdate=2013-10-28|date=1999-07-01|publisher=Civil Society Publishing|isbn=978-0-9671803-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Targets" of bullying are also sometimes referred to as "victims" of bullying.

Bullying can be defined in many different ways. The [[United Kingdom|UK]] currently has no legal definition of bullying,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =The University of Manchester Dignity at Work and Study Policy | publisher =The University of Manchester | date =January 2012 | url = http://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=2753 | accessdate = 2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some [[United States|U.S.]] states have laws against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =State Laws Related to Bullying Among Children and Youth | work = U.S. Department of Health and Human Services - Health Resources and Services Administration - Maternal and Child Health Bureau | publisher =U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | url = http://web.archive.org/web/20040529052056/http://stopbullyingnow.hrsa.gov/HHS_PSA/pdfs/SBN_Tip_6.pdf | accessdate = 2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying consists of four basic types of abuse &amp;ndash; [[Psychological abuse|emotional]] (sometimes called relational), [[Verbal abuse|verbal]], [[Physical abuse|physical]], and cyber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Brank | first =Eve M. | last2 =Hoetger | first2 =Lori A. | last3 =Hazen | first3 =Katherine P. | title =Bullying | journal =Annual Review of Law and Social Science | volume =8 | pages =213–230 | publisher =Annual Reviews | date =December 2012 | url =http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102811-173820 | doi =10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102811-173820 | accessdate = 2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It typically involves subtle methods of coercion such as intimidation.

Bullying ranges from simple one-on-one bullying to more complex bullying in which the bully may have one or more "lieutenants" who may seem to be willing to assist the primary bully in his or her bullying activities. Bullying in school and the workplace is also referred to as peer abuse.&lt;ref name="Bennett2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Bennett|title=Peer Abuse Know More!: Bullying from a Psychological Perspective|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GF06aB7mLdIC|accessdate=2013-10-29|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Infinity|isbn=978-0-7414-3265-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert W. Fuller]] has analyzed bullying in the context of [[rankism]].

A [[bullying culture]] can develop in any context in which human beings interact with each other. This includes [[School bullying|school]], family, the [[Workplace bullying|workplace]], home, and neighborhoods. In a 2012 study of male adolescent [[American Football|American football]] players, "the strongest predictor was the perception of whether the most influential male in a player's life would approve of the bullying behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Steinfeldt | first =Jesse A. | last2 =Vaughan | first2 =Ellen L.  | last3 =LaFollette | first3 =Julie R. | last4 =Steinfeldt | first4 =Matthew C. | title =Bullying among adolescent football players: Role of masculinity and moral atmosphere | journal =Psychology of Men and Masculinity | volume =13 | issue =4 | pages =340–353 | publisher =American Psychological Association | date =October 2012 | url =http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=2012-01737-001 | accessdate = 2013-10-28 | doi =10.1037/a0026645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Bullying may be defined as the activity of repeated, aggressive behavior intended to hurt another person, physically, mentally or emotionally. Bullying is characterized by an individual behaving in a certain way to gain [[Power (social and political)|power]] over another person.&lt;ref name="Besag1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Valerie E. Besag|title=Bullies and victims in schools: a guide to understanding and management|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=t2pHAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=2013-10-29|year=1989|publisher=Open University Press|isbn=978-0-335-09542-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be classified into four types:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Invitation to the Life Span|last = Berger|first = Kathleen Stassen|publisher = Worth Publishers|year = 2014|isbn = 1464172056|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Physical (hitting, punching, or kicking) 
# Verbal (name-calling or taunting)
# Relational (destroying peer acceptance and friendships)
# Cyber-bullying (using electronic means to harm others)
Physical, verbal, and relational bullying are most prevalent in primary school and could also begin much earlier in preschool. Cyber-bullying, arguably the most destructive and common form today, is more common in secondary school than in primary school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Norwegian researcher Dan Olweus&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web | title =History | work =OLWEUS Bullying Prevention Program | publisher =OLWEUS Bullying Prevention Program | url = http://www.clemson.edu/olweus/history.html | accessdate = 2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; says bullying occurs when a person is "exposed, repeatedly and over time, to negative actions on the part of one or more other persons". He says negative actions occur "when a person intentionally inflicts injury or discomfort upon another person, through physical contact, through words or in other ways."&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "[[bully]]" was first used in the 1530s meaning "sweetheart", applied to either sex, from the Dutch ''boel'' "lover, brother", probably diminutive of Middle High German ''buole'' "brother", of uncertain origin (compare with the German ''buhle'' "lover"). The meaning deteriorated through the 17th century through "fine fellow", "blusterer", to "harasser of the weak". This may have been as a connecting sense between "lover" and "ruffian" as in "protector of a prostitute", which was one sense of "bully" (though not specifically attested until 1706). The verb "to bully" is first attested in 1710.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =bully | work =Online Etymology Dictionary | publisher =Douglas Harper | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bully | accessdate = 2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
High-level forms of violence such as assault and murder usually receive most media attention, but lower-level forms of violence such as bullying have only by the 2000s started to be addressed by researchers, parents and guardians, and authority figures.&lt;ref name="NASW"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Witted | first =Kathryn S. | last2 =Dupper | first2 = David R. | title =Best Practices for Preventing or Reducing Bullying in Schools | journal =Children &amp; Schools | volume =27 | issue =3 | pages =167–175 | publisher =National Association of Social Workers | year =2005 | url =http://www.centerforviolenceprevention.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=EJcJSOFRmrY%3D&amp;tabid=176&amp;mid=616 | doi =10.1093/cs/27.3.167 | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is only in recent years that bullying has been recognised and recorded as a separate and distinct offence, but there have been well documented cases that have been recorded over the centuries.{{which|date=November 2013}} [[Virginia Woolf]] considered fascism to be a form of bullying, and wrote of Hitler and the Nazis in 1934 as "these brutal bullies".&lt;ref name="Zwerdling1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex Zwerdling|title=Virginia Woolf and the Real World|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9YkTuYctVEwC&amp;pg=PA263|accessdate=2013-10-28|year=1986|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-06184-2|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pawlowski2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Merry M.

===Of bullies and accomplices===

Bullying may also result from a genetic predisposition or a brain abnormality in the bully.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18181884|title = Genetic and environmental influences on victims, bullies and bully-victims in childhood|last = Ball|first = H.A.|date = Jan 2008|journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry|accessdate = |doi = 10.110.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01821.x|pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While parents can help a toddler develop emotional regulation and effortful control to restrict aggressive behavior, some children fail to develop these skills due to insecure attachment with their families, ineffective discipline, and environmental factors such as a stressful home life and hostile siblings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moreover, according to some researchers, bullies may be inclined toward negativity and perform poorly academically. Dr. Cook says that "a typical bully has trouble resolving problems with others and also has trouble academically. He or she usually has negative attitudes and beliefs about others, feels negatively toward himself/herself, comes from a family environment characterized by conflict and poor parenting, perceives school as negative and is negatively influenced by peers".&lt;ref name="APS2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Predictors of Bullying and Victimization in Childhood and Adolescence: A Meta-analytic Investigation | journal =School Psychology Quarterly | volume =25 | issue =2 | pages =65–83 | publisher = American Psychological Association | year =2010 | url =http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/spq-25-2-65.pdf | doi =10.1037/a0020149 | accessdate = 2013-10-28 | last1 = Cook | first1 = Clayton R. | last2 = Williams | first2 = Kirk R. | last3 = Guerra | first3 = Nancy G. | last4 = Kim | first4 = Tia E. | last5 = Sadek | first5 = Shelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrarily, some researchers have suggested that some bullies are "psychologically strongest" and have "high social standing" among their peers, while their targets are "emotionally distressed" and "socially [[marginalized]]".&lt;ref&gt;Juvonen (2003) [http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/112/6/1231.abstract ''Bullying Among Young Adolescents: The Strong, the Weak and the Troubled''] in ''Pediatrics'', December 2003, {{cite web

|url = http://www.kimberlyswygert.com/archives/001765.html
|title = The benefits of bullying
|accessdate = 2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peer groups often promote the bully's actions, and members of these peer groups also engage in behaviors, such as "mocking, excluding, punching, and insulting one another" as a source of entertainment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other researchers also argued that a minority of the bullies, those who are not in turn bullied, "enjoy going to school, and are least likely to take days off sick".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title ='Bullies are the healthiest pupils' | newspaper =BBC News | section = Education | publisher =BBC | date =1999-12-14 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/564923.stm | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research indicates that adults who bully have [[authoritarian]] personalities, combined with a strong need to [[Control freak|control]] or [[dominance (ethology)|dominate]].&lt;ref name="Brodsky1976"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carroll M. Brodsky|title=The Harassed Worker|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MZEeAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=2013-10-29|year=1976|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-669-01041-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that a [[prejudicial]] view of subordinates can be a particularly strong risk factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Ashforth | first =Blake | title =Petty Tyranny in Organizations | journal =Human Relations | volume =47 | issue =7 | pages =755–778 | publisher =The Tavistock Institute | year =1994 | url =http://hum.sagepub.com/content/47/7/755.abstract | doi =10.1177/001872679404700701 | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Of typical bystanders===
Often bullying takes place in the presence of a large group of relatively uninvolved bystanders. In many cases, it is the bully's ability to create the illusion that he or she has the support of the majority present that instills the fear of "speaking out" in protestation of the bullying activities being observed by the group. Unless the "bully mentality" is effectively challenged in any given group in its early stages, it often becomes an accepted, or supported, [[Norm (social)|norm]] within the group.&lt;ref name = "bystander attitudes"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first =	 | title =Bullies, Victims, and Bystanders | work =athealth.com: Consumer: Issues | publisher =Athealth.com | url = http://www.athealth.com/Consumer/issues/BulliesVictimsBystanders3.html | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =New Tactics To Tackle Bystander's Role In Bullying | newspaper =Science Daily | section = Science News | publisher =Science Daily, LLC | date =2009-01-27 | url =http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090125193150.htm | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the general unwillingness of bystanders to expend these types of energies and to undertake this type of risk that bullies often rely upon in order to maintain their power. Unless action is taken, a "[[Bullying culture|culture of bullying]]" is often perpetuated within a group for months, years, or longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =419: Petty Tyrant | work =This American Life: Radio Archive | publisher =Chicago Public Media &amp; Ira Glass | date =2010-11-12 | url = http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/419/petty-tyrant | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bystanders who have been able to establish their own "friendship group" or "support group" have been found to be far more likely to opt to speak out against bullying behavior than those who have not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Pasco students get 'hero' training to stop bullying | newspaper =TBO.com (The Tampa Tribune) | section = pasco-county | publisher =Tampa Media Group, LLC | date =2010-10-12 | url =http://tbo.com/pasco-county/pasco-students-get-hero-training-to-stop-bullying-24060 | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title =Program Helps Students Combat Bullying - Students participate with enthusiasm | work =Winning Harmony Counselling | location =Clearwater, Florida, U.S.A. | publisher =Jim Porter | date =2010-10-04 | url =http://www.winningharmony.com/News_and_Events.php | accessdate = 2013-10-29 | postscript =&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to communication of clear expectations that bystanders should intervene and increasing individual [[self-efficacy]], there is growing research that suggests interventions should build on the foundation that children’s belief that bullying is morally wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Thornberg | first =Robert | last2 =Tenenbaum | first2 =Laura | last3 =Varjas | first3 =Kris | last4 =Meyers | first4 =Joel | last5 =Jungert | first5 =Tomas | last6 =Vanegas | first6 =Gina | title =Bystander Motivation in Bullying Incidents: To Intervene or Not to Intervene? | journal =Western Journal of Emergency Medicine | volume =13 | issue =3 | pages =247–252 | publisher =National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine | date =August 2012 | language =  | doi =10.5811/westjem.2012.3.11792| pmc =3415829 | pmid =22900122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among adults, being a bystander to workplace bullying was linked to depressive symptoms, particularly for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Jensen | first =I.

B. | pmid =22940902 | pmc =3722445| last2 =Alipour }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Of victims===
Dr. Cook says that "A typical victim is likely to be aggressive, lack social skills, think negative thoughts, experience difficulties in solving social problems, come from a negative family, school and community environments and be noticeably rejected and isolated by peers".&lt;ref name="APS2010"/&gt; Victims often have characteristics such as being physically weak as well as being easily distraught emotionally. They may also have physical characteristics that make them easier targets for bullies such as being overweight or having some type of physical [[deformity]]. Boys are more likely to be victims of physical bullying while girls are more likely to be bullied indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;Paediatrics and Child Health, 2010, Vol.20(7), pp.315-320 [Peer Reviewed Journal]Vanderbilt, Douglas ; Augustyn, Marilyn url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751722210000715&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of a  [[Meta-analysis|metanalysis]] conducted by Cook and  published by the [[American Psychological Association]] in 2010  concluded the main risk factors for children and adolescents being bullied, and also  for becoming bullies,  are the lack of [[social problem-solving]] skills.&lt;ref name="APS2010"/&gt;

==Effects==
{{Undue-section|date=May 2014}}
Mona O'Moore of the Anti-Bullying Centre at Trinity College in Dublin, has written, "There is a growing body of research which indicates that individuals, whether child or adult, who are persistently subjected to abusive behavior are at risk of stress related illness which can sometimes lead to suicide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Anti-Bullying Centre | work =Trinity College Dublin | publisher =| url = http://www.abc.tcd.ie/ | accessdate = 2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suicide===
{{Main|Bullying and suicide}}
Even though there is evidence that bullying increases the risk of [[suicide]], bullying alone does not cause suicide. [[Depression (mood)|Depression]] is one of the main reasons why kids who are bullied commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kim YS, Leventhal B |title=Bullying and suicide. A review |journal=International Journal of Adolescent Medicine and Health |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=133–54 |year=2008 |pmid=18714552|doi=10.1515/IJAMH.2008.20.2.133|last2=Leventhal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that between 15 and 25 children commit suicide every year in the UK alone, because they are being bullied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coastkid.org/si-sob.html Statistics on bullying] {{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain races and genders are at a higher risk for suicide than others such as; American Indian, Alaskan Native, Asian American, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender. When someone is unsupported by his or her family or friends, it can make the situation much worse for the victim. http://www.stopbullying.gov/at-risk/effects/#suicide

While some people find it very easy to ignore a bully, others may find it very difficult and reach a breaking point. There have been cases of apparent bullying suicides that have been reported closely by the media. These include the deaths of [[Suicide of Ryan Halligan|Ryan Halligen]], [[Suicide of Phoebe Prince|Phoebe Prince]], [[Suicide of Dawn-Marie Wesley|Dawn-Marie Wesley]], [[Kelly Yeomans]], Jessica Haffer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Jessica Kassandra Haffer | publisher =Keith &amp; Jeralyn Haffer | url = http://www.jessicahaffer.com/ | accessdate = 2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamed Nastoh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Hamed Nastoh | url = http://www.angelfire.com/bc2/hamed/ | accessdate = 2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; April Himes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Caruso | first =Kevin | title =April Himes Memorial | work =Suicide.org | publisher =Suicide.org | url = http://www.suicide.org/memorials/april-himes.html | accessdate = 2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cherice Moralez&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =McLaughlin | first =Elliot C. | title =Montana teen loved pit bulls, poetry before rape and suicide | work =CNN | section = U.S. | publisher =Cable News Network | date =2013-08-30 | url =http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/30/us/montana-teacher-rape-victim-profile/index.html  | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rebecca Ann Sedwick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Pearce | first =Matt | title =Florida girl, 12, found dead after bullies said 'kill yourself' | newspaper =Los Angeles Times | section = U.S.: Nation Now | publisher =Los Angeles Times | date =2013-09-12 | url =http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-florida-cyberbullying-20130912,0,1429218.story#axzz2j8q54wL8 | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence===
Bullied students [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]] carried out the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]]. Since then, bullying has been more closely linked to high school violence in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Boodman | first =Sandra G. | title =Gifted and Tormented | newspaper =The Washington Post | section = Health | publisher =The Washington Post | date =2006-05-16 | url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/15/AR2006051501103.html | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Serial killers]] were frequently bullied through direct and indirect methods as children or adolescents. [[Henry Lee Lucas]], a serial killer and diagnosed [[psychopath]], said the ridicule and rejection he suffered as a child caused him to hate everyone. [[Kenneth Bianchi]], a serial killer and member of the [[Hillside Stranglers]], was teased as a child because he urinated in his pants and suffered twitching, and as a teenager was ignored by his peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Scott | first =	Shirley Lynn | title =What Makes Serial Killers Tick? | work =Crime library | publisher =Turner Entertainment Networks, Inc. A Time Warner Company | url = http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/tick/victims_1.html | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positive development===
Some have argued that bullying can teach life lessons and instill strength. Helene Guldberg, a child development academic, sparked controversy when she argued that being a target of bullying can teach a child "how to manage disputes and boost their ability to interact with others", and that teachers should not intervene, but leave children to respond to the bullying themselves:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =Tanya | title =Child Development Academician Says Bullying Is Beneficial To Kids | work =Med India | section = News | publisher =Medindia | date =2009-02-02 | url =http://www.medindia.net/news/Child-Development-Academician-Says-Bullying-Is-Beneficial-To-Kids-46992-1.htm | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that the majority of those who may find themselves to be the targets of bullying behavior may ultimately feel "harmed" by such targeting, a few  studies have pointed up some potentially positive outcomes from bullying behavior.&lt;ref name="fight back"&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1280625/Bullying-good-children-Study-finds-fight-popular.html Study describing how "learning to fight back" can help students to mature.]&lt;/ref&gt;  These studies have found that with some individuals, as a result of their having been targeted with bullying behavior, this certain minority of former bullying "targets" have actually experienced being "enabled" through their experiences with bullying to develop various [[Coping (psychology)|coping strategies]] which included "standing up for themselves" in ways which acted to "re-balance" former imbalances of power.  Such former bullying targets have reported such things as "becoming a better person" as a result of their former bullying ordeals.&lt;ref name = "fight back"/&gt;  The teaching of such anti-bullying coping skills to "would-be-targets" and to others has been found to be an effective long term means of reducing bullying incidence rates and a valuable skill-set for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.careforkids.com.au/childcarenews/2010/july/bullying.html Positive Anti-Bullying Strategies by Melissa Graham]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dark triad==
{{Main|Dark triad}}
Research on the dark triad ([[narcissism]], [[Machiavellianism]] and [[psychopathy]]) indicate a correlation with bullying as part of evidence of the aversive nature of those traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chabrol&amp;nbsp;H., Van Leeuwen N., Rodgers&amp;nbsp;R., Séjourné&amp;nbsp;S.| year = 2009 | title = Contributions of psychopathic, narcissistic, Machiavellian, and sadistic personality traits to juvenile delinquency|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|volume =47|issue=7|pages=734–39|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2009.06.020 | last2 = Van Leeuwen | last3 = Rodgers | last4 = Séjourné }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projection==
{{Main|Psychological projection}}
A bully may project his/her own feelings of [[vulnerability]] onto the target(s) of the bullying activity.  Despite the fact that a bully's typically denigrating activities are aimed at the bully's targets, the true source of such negativity is ultimately almost always found in the bully's own sense of personal [[Emotional security|insecurity]] and/ or vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gilbert, ''Overcoming Depression'' (1999) p.&amp;nbsp;185–6&lt;/ref&gt;  Such aggressive projections of displaced negative emotions can occur anywhere from the micro-level of [[interpersonal relationships]], all the way up through to the macro-level of international politics, or even international armed conflict.&lt;ref name="micro and macro projection"&gt;Carl G. Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) p.&amp;nbsp;181–2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emotional intelligence==
{{Main|Bullying and emotional intelligence}}
Bullying is [[abusive]] [[social interaction]] between peers which can include [[aggression]], [[harassment]], and [[violence]]. Bullying is typically repetitive and enacted by those who are in a position of [[power and control in abusive relationships|power]] over the victim. A growing body of research illustrates a significant relationship between bullying and [[emotional intelligence]]. [[John D. Mayer|Mayer]] et al., (2008) defines the dimensions of overall EI as: "accurately perceiving emotion, using emotions to facilitate thought, understanding emotion, and managing emotion".&lt;ref&gt;Mayer,J.D., Roberts, R.D &amp; Barasade, S.G. (2008) Human abilities: Emotional intelligence. ''The Annual Review of Psychology'', ''59'', 507-536. DOI: 10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093646&lt;/ref&gt; The concept combines emotional and intellectual processes.&lt;ref name=Tolegenova &gt;Tolegenova, A.A., Jakupov, S.M., Man Cheung Chung, Saduova, S. &amp; Jakupov, M.S (2012) [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.12.142 A theoretical formation of emotional intelligence and childhood trauma among adolescents.] “Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences”, 69, 1891-1894. International Conference on Education and Educational Psychology (ICEEPSY 2012). DOI: 10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.12.142&lt;/ref&gt; Lower emotional intelligence appears to be related to involvement in bullying, as the bully and/or the victim of bullying. EI seems to play an important role in both bullying behavior and [[victimization]] in bullying; given that EI is illustrated to be malleable, EI education could greatly improve bullying prevention and intervention initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Mckenna, J. &amp; Webb, J. (2013) Emotional intelligence. British Journal of Occupational Therapy, 76(12), 560.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In different contexts==
===Cyberbullying===
{{Main|Cyberbullying}}
Cyber-bullying is any bullying done through the use of technology. This form of bullying can easily go undetected because of lack of parental/authoritative supervision. Because bullies can pose as someone else, it is the most anonymous form of bullying. Cyber bullying includes, but is not limited to, abuse using email, instant messaging, text messaging, websites, social networking sites, etc.&lt;ref name="BoltonGraeve2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jose Bolton|author2=Stan Graeve|title=No Room for Bullies: From the Classroom to Cyberspace|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WOUWBckRIBIC|accessdate=2013-10-29|year=2005|publisher=Boys Town Press|isbn=978-1-889322-67-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Particular watch dog organizations have been designed to contain the spread of cyber-bullying.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===Disability bullying===
{{Main|Disability bullying}}
It has been noted that disabled people are disproportionately affected by bullying and abuse, and such activity has been cited as a hate crime.&lt;ref name="Quarmby2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Katherine Quarmby|title=Scapegoat: Why We Are Failing Disabled People|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lglMYgEACAAJ|accessdate=2013-10-29|year=2011|publisher=Portobello Books Limited|isbn=978-1-84627-321-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bullying is not limited to those who are visibly disabled such as wheelchair-users or physically deformed such as those with a [[cleft lip]] but also those with [[learning disabilities]] such as [[autism]]&lt;ref name="Sainsbury2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clare Sainsbury|title=Martian in the Playground: Understanding the Schoolchild with Asperger's Syndrome|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TbGwEaH8eAIC|accessdate=2013-10-29|date=30 September 2009|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4462-4398-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Attwood2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tony Attwood|title=The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZwQGsuCNMPYC|accessdate=2013-10-29|year=2006|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1-84310-495-7|pages=95–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[developmental coordination disorder]].&lt;ref name="Kirby2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Amanda Kirby|title=Dyspraxia: The Hidden Handicap|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=so-3-vIf0lkC|accessdate=2013-10-29|date=1 October 2002|publisher=Souvenir Press|isbn=978-0-285-63512-8|pages=106–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brookes2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoff Brookes|title=Dyspraxia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wZDqe-SckjIC|accessdate=2013-10-29|date=January 2005|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-8264-7581-7|pages=43–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter case, this is linked to a poor ability in physical education, and this behaviour can be encouraged by the unthinking physical education teacher. Abuse of the disabled is not limited to schools. There are many known cases in which the disabled have been abused by staff of a "care institution", such as the case revealed in a [[BBC]] Panorama programme on a Castlebeck care home ([[Winterbourne View]]) near [[Bristol]] which led to its closure and the suspension and sacking of some of the staff.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news | title =Four arrests after patient abuse caught on film | newspaper =BBC News | section = UK | publisher =BBC | date =2011-06-01 | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13548222 | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an additional problem that those with learning disabilities are often not as able to explain things to other people so are more likely to be disbelieved or ignored if they do complain.

===Gay bullying===
{{Main|Gay bashing}}
Gay bullying and gay bashing are expressions used to designate [[verbal abuse|verbal]] or [[physical abuse|physical]] actions that are direct or indirect in nature by a person or group against a person who is [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexual]], [[transgendered]] ([[LGBT]]), or of questionable sexual orientation, or one who is perceived to be so, because of [[rumors]] or fitting gay [[stereotype]]s.  Gay and lesbian youth are more likely to report bullying.&lt;ref name="Berlan et al., 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Berlan | first =Elise D. | last2 =Corliss | first2 =Heather L. | last3 =Field | first3 =Alison E. | last4 =Goodman | first4 =Elizabeth | last5 =Austin | first5 =S.

===Legal bullying===
{{Main|Legal abuse}}
Legal bullying is the bringing of a [[Vexatious litigation|vexatious legal action]] to control and punish a person.  Legal bullying can often take the form of frivolous, repetitive, or burdensome lawsuits brought to intimidate the defendant into submitting to the litigant's request, not because of the legal merit of the litigant's position, but principally due to the defendant's inability to maintain the legal battle.  This can also take the form of [[Strategic lawsuit against public participation|SLAPPs]].  It was partially concern about the potential for this kind of abuse that helped to fuel the [[protests against SOPA and PIPA]] in the United States in 2011 and 2012.

===Military bullying===
{{Main|Bullying in the military}}
In 2000, the UK [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MOD) defined bullying as "the use of physical strength or the [[abuse of authority]] to [[intimidate]] or [[Victimization|victimize]] others, or to give unlawful punishments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Dannatt | first =Sir Richard | title =Values and Standards of the British Army | section =Lawful: Paragraph 20 | publisher =the British Army | year =2008 | url = http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/v_s_of_the_british_army.pdf | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that this behaviour should be allowed, due to ways in which "soldiering" is different from other occupations. Soldiers expected to risk their lives should, according to them, develop strength of body and spirit to accept bullying.&lt;ref name="CallaghanKernic2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean M.

===Parental bullying of children===
Parents who may [[Displacement (psychology)|displace]] their anger, insecurity, or a persistent need to dominate and control, upon their children in excessive ways have been proven to increase the likelihood that their own children will in turn become overly aggressive or controlling towards their peers.&lt;ref name = "parent bullying"&gt;{{cite web | last =Priesnitz | first =	Wendy | title =Parental Bullying Creates Bullies | work =Natural Child Magazine | publisher =Wendy Priesnitz | url = http://www.naturalchildmagazine.com/news/parental_bullying_creates_bullies.htm | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[American Psychological Association]] advises on its website that parents who may suspect that their own children may be engaging in bullying activities amongst their peers, should carefully consider the examples which they themselves may be setting for their own children, regarding how they typically interact with their own peers, colleagues, and children.  Do the parents typically motivate their peers and their children with positive and self-confidence building incentives, or do they most often attempt to motivate their peers and children with certain "threats" of one form of "punishment" or "reprisal" or another ([[emotional blackmail]] or physical blackmail)?&lt;ref name = "APA on parental bullying"&gt;{{cite web | title =Bullying: How parents, teachers, and kids can take action to prevent bullying | work =American Psychological Association | publisher =American Psychological Association | url = http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/bullying.aspx# | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prison bullying===
{{Main|Prisoner abuse}}
Another environment known for bullying is a country's prison service. This is almost inevitable when many of the people incarcerated are there for aggressive crimes and many were bullies at school. An additional complication is the staff and their relationships with the inmates. Thus the following possible bullying scenarios are possible:
* Inmate bullies inmate (echoing school bullying);
* Staff bullies inmate;
* Staff bullies staff (a manifestation of workplace bullying);
* Inmate bullies staff.

===School bullying===
{{Main|School bullying}}
Bullying can occur in nearly any part in or around the school building, though it may occur more frequently in [[physical education]] classes and activities, [[Recess (break)|recess]], [[hallway]]s, bathrooms, on [[school bus]]es and while waiting for buses, and in classes that require group work and/or after school activities. Bullying in school sometimes consists of a group of students taking advantage of or isolating one student in particular and gaining the loyalty of bystanders who want to avoid becoming the next target. These bullies may taunt and tease their target before physically bullying the target. Bystanders may participate or watch, sometimes out of fear of becoming the next target.

Bullying can also be perpetrated by teachers and the school system itself: There is an inherent power differential in the system that can easily predispose to subtle or covert abuse ([[relational aggression]] or [[passive aggression]]), [[humiliation]], or exclusion — even while maintaining overt commitments to anti-bullying policies.&lt;ref name="GarbarinodeLara2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Garbarino|author2=Ellen deLara|title=And Words Can Hurt Forever: How to Protect Adolescents from Bullying, Harassment, and Emotional Violence|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3XPx-OLgQjQC|accessdate=2013-10-29|date=2 September 2003|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-0-7432-2899-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Witted | first =Kathryn Suzanne | title =Student Reports of Physical and Psychological Maltreatment in Schools: An Under Explored Aspect of Student Victimization in Schools | work = PhD dissertation, University of Tennessee | year =2005 | url =http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3874&amp;context=utk_graddiss | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1177/0013124507304487 |title=Do Teachers Bully Students?: Findings From a Survey of Students in an Alternative Education Setting |year=2007 |last1=Whitted |first1=K.

====In teaching====
{{Main|Bullying in teaching}}
[[School]] [[teachers]] are commonly the subject of bullying but they are also sometimes the originators of bullying within a school environment.

===Sexual bullying===
{{Main|Sexual bullying}}
{{See also|Slut shaming}}
Sexual bullying is "any bullying behaviour, whether physical or non-physical, that is based on a person's sexuality or gender. It is when sexuality or gender is used as a weapon by boys or girls towards other boys or girls - although it is more commonly directed at girls. It can be carried out to a person's face, behind their back or through the use of technology."&lt;ref name=NSPCC02 &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/resourcesforteachers/classroomresources/sexual_bullying_definition_wdf68769.pdf |title=The NSPCC working definition of Sexual Bullying |publisher=[[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] |accessdate=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workplace bullying===
{{Main|Workplace bullying}}
The Workplace Bullying and Trauma Institute defines workplace bullying as "repeated, health-harming mistreatment, [[verbal abuse]], or conduct which is threatening, [[humiliating]], [[intimidating]], or [[sabotage]] that interferes with work, or some combination of the three".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =The WBI Definition of Workplace Bullying | work =Workplace Bullying Institute | publisher = Workplace Bullying Institute | url = http://www.workplacebullying.org/individuals/problem/definition/ | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics show that bullying is 3 times as prevalent as illegal [[discrimination]] and at least 1,600 times as prevalent as [[workplace violence]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Statistics also show that while only one employee in every 10,000 becomes a target of workplace violence, one in six experiences bullying at work. Bullying is a little more common than [[sexual harassment]] but not verbal abuse which occurs more than bullying.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Unlike the more physical form of [[school bullying]], workplace bullying often takes place within the established rules and policies of the organization and society. Such actions are not necessarily illegal and may not even be against a firm's regulations; however, the damage to the targeted employee and to [[workplace morale]] is obvious.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

====In academia====
{{Main|Bullying in academia}}
Bullying in academia is workplace bullying of scholars and staff in [[academia]], especially places of [[higher education]] such as [[college]]s and [[universities]]. It is believed{{by whom|date=March 2014}} to be common, although has not received as much attention from researchers as bullying in some other contexts.&lt;ref&gt;

====In blue collar jobs====
Bullying has been identified{{by whom|date=March 2014}} as prominent in [[blue collar]] jobs including on oil rigs and in mechanic shops and machine shops. It is thought that [[intimidation]] and fear of [[retributive justice|retribution]] cause decreased incident reports. In industry sectors dominated by males, typically of little education, where disclosure of incidents are seen as [[wikt:effeminate|effeminate]], reporting in the socioeconomic and cultural milieu of such industries would likely lead to a [[vicious circle]]. This is often used{{by whom|date=March 2014}} in combination with [[psychological manipulation|manipulation]] and [[coercion]] of facts to gain favour among higher-ranking [[administrator (business)|administrators]].&lt;ref&gt;

A culture of bullying is common in [[information technology (IT)]], leading to high sickness rates, low [[morale]], poor [[productivity]], and high [[Turnover (employment)|staff-turnover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Thomson | first =Rebecca | title =IT profession blighted by bullying | work = ComputerWeekly.com: Feature | publisher =TechTarget | url = http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/IT-profession-blighted-by-bullying | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deadline-driven project work and stressed-out managers take their toll on IT workers.&lt;ref name="RichardsEdwards2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ann Richards

{{Main|Bullying in medicine}}
Bullying in the [[medical profession]] is common,{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} particularly of student or trainee doctors and of nurses. It is thought{{by whom|date=March 2014}} that this is at least in part an outcome of conservative traditional [[Hierarchical organization|hierarchical structures]] and [[teaching methods]] in the medical profession, which may result in a bullying cycle.

====In nursing====
{{Main|Bullying in nursing}}
Even though The American Nurses Association believes that all nursing personnel have the right to work in safe, non-abusive environments, bullying has been identified as being particularly prevalent{{quantify|date=March 2014}} in the [[nursing]] [[profession]] although the reasons are not clear. It is thought{{by whom|date=March 2014}} that [[relational aggression]] (psychological aspects of bullying such as [[gossipping]] and [[intimidation]]) are relevant. Relational aggression has been studied amongst girls but not so much amongst adult women.&lt;ref name="RichardsEdwards2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;. http://www.nursingworld.org/Bullying-Workplace-Violence

As the verb ''to bully'' is defined as simply "forcing one's way aggressively or by intimidation", the term may generally apply to ''any'' life experience where one is motivated primarily by intimidation instead of by more positive goals such as mutually shared interests and benefits. As such, any figure of authority or power which may use intimidation as a primary means of motivating others, such as a neighborhood "protection racket don", a national dictator, a childhood ring-leader, a terrorist, a terrorist organization, or even a ruthless business CEO, could rightfully be referred to as a bully. According to psychologist Pauline Rennie-Peyton, we each face the possibility of being bullied in any phase of our lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Karim | first = Nadiya | title =Bullying in Universities: It exists | newspaper =The Independent | section = News: Education: Higher | publisher =The Independent | date =2010-01-15 | url =http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/bullying-in-universities-it-exists-1869267.html | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:File-Bully Prevention.jpg|thumbnail|right|October is the month used to educate and raise awareness to prevent bullying. ]] --&gt;

=== In schools ===
School connectedness is the positive relationship between students, teachers, administrators, and educational support professionals. Studies have shown that, bullying programs set up in schools with the help and engagements of staffs and faculty have shown to reduce peer victimization and bullying.&lt;ref&gt;O’Brennan, L. M., Waasdorp, T. E., &amp; Bradshaw, C. P. (2014). Strengthening bullying prevention through school staff connectedness. Journal Of Educational Psychology, 106(3), 870-880. doi:10.1037/a0035957&lt;/ref&gt; Incidence of bullying is noticeably reduced when the students themselves disapprove of bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Implementing bullying prevention in diverse settings: Geographic, economic, and cultural influences|last = Guerra|first = Nancy G.|date = 2010|journal = Oxford University Press|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = |last2 = Williams|first2 = Kirk R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research indicates that methods such as "increasing awareness, instituting zero tolerance for fighting, or placing troubled students in the same group or classroom" are ineffective in reducing bullying while other measures, including increasing empathy for victims, adopting a program with a "whole school" approach which includes all teachers, students, and parents, and student-led anti-bullying efforts, have shown significant progress and success.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A review of all research regarding anti-bullying efforts in schools summarizes the most successful ways:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Update on bullying at school: Science forgotten?|last = Berger|first = Kathleen Stassen|date = 2007|journal = Developmental Review|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Everyone in the school must change, not only the identified bullies.
* Intervention must begin in early grades.
* Evaluation of the programs in place is critical since some programs may increase bullying rather than reduce it.
