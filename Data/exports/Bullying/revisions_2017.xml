'''Bullying''' is the use of force, threat, or [[coercion]] to [[abuse]], [[intimidate]], or aggressively [[wikt:domination|dominate]] others. The behavior is often repeated and habitual. One essential prerequisite is the perception, by the bully or by others, of an imbalance of [[Power (social and political)|social]] or physical power, which distinguishes bullying from conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Juvonen, J. |author2=Graham, S. | title =Bullying in Schools: The Power of Bullies and the Plight of Victims | journal =Annual Review of Psychology| volume =65 | publisher =Annual Reviews | date =2014| pages=159–85 | url =http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-psych-010213-115030 | doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-010213-115030 | pmid=23937767}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviors used to assert such domination can include verbal [[harassment]] or [[threat]], physical [[assault]] or coercion, and such acts may be directed repeatedly towards particular targets.

Bullying ranges from one-on-one, individual bullying through to group bullying called [[mobbing]], in which the bully may have one or more "lieutenants" who may seem to be willing to assist the primary bully in his or her bullying activities. Bullying in school and the workplace is also referred to as peer abuse.&lt;ref name="Bennett2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Bennett|title=Peer Abuse Know More!: Bullying from a Psychological Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GF06aB7mLdIC|accessdate=2013-10-29|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Infinity|isbn=978-0-7414-3265-0|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914150852/http://books.google.com/books?id=GF06aB7mLdIC|archivedate=14 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert W.

[[File:Bullying synonyms.png|thumb|Bullying synonyms]]
There is no universal definition of bullying, however, it is widely agreed upon that bullying is a subcategory of aggressive behavior characterized by the following three minimum criteria: (1) hostile intent, (2) imbalance of power, and (3) repetition over a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burger |first=Christoph |last2=Strohmeier |first2=Dagmar |last3=Spröber |first3=Nina |last4=Bauman |first4=Sheri |last5=Rigby |first5=Ken |date=2015 |title=How teachers respond to school bullying: An examination of self-reported intervention strategy use, moderator effects, and concurrent use of multiple strategies |journal=Teaching and Teacher Education |pages=191–202 |doi=10.1016/j.tate.2015.07.004 |volume=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying may thus be defined as the activity of repeated, aggressive behavior intended to hurt another individual, physically, mentally or emotionally.

The Norwegian researcher Dan Olweus&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web | title =History | work =OLWEUS Bullying Prevention Program | publisher =OLWEUS Bullying Prevention Program | url =http://www.clemson.edu/olweus/history.html | accessdate =2013-10-28 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131029204025/http://www.clemson.edu/olweus/history.html | archivedate =2013-10-29 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; says bullying occurs when a person is "exposed, repeatedly and over time, to negative actions on the part of one or more other persons". He says negative actions occur "when a person intentionally inflicts injury or discomfort upon another person, through physical contact, through words or in other ways."&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; Individual bullying is usually characterized by a person behaving in a certain way to gain [[Power (social and political)|power]] over another person.&lt;ref name="Besag1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Valerie E.

== Types ==
Individual bullying can be classified into four types.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Invitation to the Life Span|last = Berger|first = Kathleen Stassen|publisher = Worth Publishers|year = 2014|isbn = 1464172056|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Collective bullying is known as mobbing, and can include any of the individual types of bullying.

Physical, verbal, and relational bullying are most prevalent in primary school and could also begin much earlier whilst continuing into later stages in individuals lives. It is stated that Cyber-bullying is more common in secondary school than in primary school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Individual ===
Individual bullying tactics can be perpetrated by a single person against a target or targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://respect2all.org/bullying-definitions/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304140405/http://respect2all.org/bullying-definitions/ |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Physical ====
This is any bullying that hurts someone’s body or damages their possessions. Stealing, shoving, hitting, fighting, and destroying property all are types of physical bullying. Physical bullying is rarely the first form of bullying that a target will experience. Often bullying will begin in a different form and later progress to physical violence. In physical bullying the main weapon the bully uses is their body when attacking their target.Sometimes groups of young adults will target and alienate a peer because of some adolescent prejudice. This can quickly lead to a situation where they are being taunted, tortured, and beaten-up by their classmates. Physical bullying can lead to a tragic ending and therefore must be stopped quickly to prevent any further escalation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nobullying.com/physical-bullying/|title=no bullying|last=|first=|date=|website=https://nobullying.com/physical-bullying/|publisher=|access-date=30 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201023450/https://nobullying.com/physical-bullying/|archivedate=1 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Verbal ====
This is any bullying that is conducted by speaking. Calling names, spreading rumors, threatening somebody, and making fun of others are all forms of verbal bullying. Verbal bullying is one of the most common types of bullying. In verbal bullying the main weapon the bully uses is their ''voice''. In many cases, verbal bullying is the province of girls. Girls are more subtle (and can be more devastating), in general, than boys. Girls use verbal bullying, as well as social exclusion techniques, to dominate and control other individuals and show their superiority and power. However, there are also many boys with subtlety enough to use verbal techniques for domination, and who are practiced in using words when they want to avoid the trouble that can come with physically bullying someone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bullyingstatistics.org/content/verbal-bullying.html|title=What is Verbal Bullying and How to Handle Verbal Bullies - Bullying Statistics|date=2015-07-08|newspaper=Bullying Statistics|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125110622/http://www.bullyingstatistics.org/content/verbal-bullying.html|archivedate=2016-11-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relational ====
This is any bullying that is done with the intent to hurt somebody’s reputation or social standing which can also link in with the techniques included in physical and verbal bullying. Relational Bullying is a form of bullying common amongst youth, but particularly upon girls. Relational bullying can be used as a tool by bullies to both improve their social standing and control others. Unlike physical bullying which is obvious, relational bullying is not overt and can continue for a long time without being noticed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://antibullyingsoftware.com/what-is-the-definition-of-relational-bullying-social-bullying/|title=What is the Definition of Relational Bullying / Social Bullying  - BRIM Anti-Bullying Software|last=Norton|first=Chris|newspaper=BRIM Anti-Bullying Software|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201080421/https://antibullyingsoftware.com/what-is-the-definition-of-relational-bullying-social-bullying/|archivedate=2016-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cyber-bullying ====
Cyber bullying is the use of technology to harass, threaten, embarrass, or target another person. When an adult is involved, it may meet the definition of '''cyber-harassment''' or '''cyberstalking''', a crime that can have legal consequences and involve jail time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/cyberbullying.html|title=Cyberbullying|website=kidshealth.org|access-date=2016-11-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201165708/http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/cyberbullying.html|archivedate=2016-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes email, instant messaging, social networking sites (such as Facebook), text messages, and cell phones.

=== Collective ===
Collective bullying tactics are employed by more than one individual against a target or targets. [[Internet troll|Trolling behavior]] on social media, although generally assumed to be individual in nature by the casual reader, is sometime organized efforts by sponsored [[astroturfing|astroturfers]].

==== Mobbing ====
{{Main article|Mobbing}}
Mobbing refers to the bullying of an individual by a group, in any context, such as a [[family]], [[peer group]], [[school]], [[workplace]], [[neighborhood]], [[community]], or online. When it occurs as [[emotion]]al [[abuse]] in the workplace, such as "ganging up" by co-workers, [[Hierarchy|subordinate]]s or [[Superior (hierarchy)|superior]]s, to force someone out of the workplace through [[rumor]], [[innuendo]], [[intimidation]], [[humiliation]], [[discrediting]], and [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolation]], it is also referred to as malicious, nonsexual, nonracial / racial, general [[harassment]].&lt;ref&gt;Mobbing: Emotional Abuse in the American Workplace by Noa Davenport, Ruth D.

Dr. Cook says that "a typical bully has trouble resolving problems with others and also has trouble academically. He or she usually has negative attitudes and beliefs about others, feels negatively toward himself/herself, comes from a family environment characterized by conflict and poor parenting, perceives school as negative and is negatively influenced by peers".&lt;ref name="APS2010"&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink =  | title = Predictors of Bullying and Victimization in Childhood and Adolescence: A Meta-analytic Investigation | journal = School Psychology Quarterly | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 65–83 | publisher = American Psychological Association | year = 2010 | url = http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/spq-25-2-65.pdf | doi = 10.1037/a0020149 | accessdate = 2013-10-28 | last1 = Cook | first1 = Clayton R. | last2 = Williams | first2 = Kirk R. | last3 = Guerra | first3 = Nancy G. | last4 = Kim | first4 = Tia E. | last5 = Sadek | first5 = Shelly | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140307231300/http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/spq-25-2-65.pdf | archivedate = 2014-03-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrarily, some researchers have suggested that some bullies are psychologically strongest and have high social standing among their peers, while their targets are emotionally distressed and socially marginalized.&lt;ref&gt;Juvonen (2003) [http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/112/6/1231.abstract ''Bullying Among Young Adolescents: The Strong, the Weak and the Troubled''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818110341/http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/112/6/1231.abstract |date=2011-08-18 }} in ''Pediatrics'', December 2003, {{cite web

=== Of typical bystanders ===
Often, bullying takes place in the presence of a large group of relatively uninvolved bystanders. In many cases, it is the bully's ability to create the illusion that he or she has the support of the majority present that instills the fear of "speaking out" in protestation of the bullying activities being observed by the group. Unless the "bully mentality" is effectively challenged in any given group in its early stages, it often becomes an accepted, or supported, [[Norm (social)|norm]] within the group.&lt;ref name="bystander attitudes"&gt;{{cite web | title =Bullies, Victims, and Bystanders | work =athealth.com: Consumer: Issues | publisher =Athealth.com | url =http://www.athealth.com/Consumer/issues/BulliesVictimsBystanders3.html | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140305091427/http://www.athealth.com/Consumer/issues/BulliesVictimsBystanders3.html | archivedate =2014-03-05 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =New Tactics To Tackle Bystander's Role In Bullying | newspaper =Science Daily | department =Science News | publisher =Science Daily, LLC | date =2009-01-27 | url =http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090125193150.htm | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184804/http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090125193150.htm | archivedate =2013-10-29 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless action is taken, a "[[Bullying culture|culture of bullying]]" is often perpetuated within a group for months, years, or longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =419: Petty Tyrant | work =This American Life: Radio Archive | publisher =Chicago Public Media &amp; Ira Glass | date =2010-11-12 | url =http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/419/petty-tyrant | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131010093611/http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/419/petty-tyrant | archivedate =2013-10-10 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bystanders who have been able to establish their own "friendship group" or "support group" have been found to be far more likely to opt to speak out against bullying behavior than those who have not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Pasco students get 'hero' training to stop bullying | newspaper =[[The Tampa Tribune]] | department =Pasco County | publisher =Tampa Media Group, LLC | date =2010-10-12 | url =http://tbo.com/pasco-county/pasco-students-get-hero-training-to-stop-bullying-24060 | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140502001344/http://tbo.com/pasco-county/pasco-students-get-hero-training-to-stop-bullying-24060 | archivedate =2014-05-02 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title =Program Helps Students Combat Bullying - Students participate with enthusiasm | work =Winning Harmony Counselling | location =Clearwater, Florida, U.S.A. | publisher =Jim Porter | date =2010-10-04 | url =http://www.winningharmony.com/News_and_Events.php | accessdate =2013-10-29 | postscript =&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In addition to communication of clear expectations that bystanders should intervene and increasing individual self-efficacy, there is growing research that suggests interventions should build on the foundation that bullying is morally wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Thornberg | first =Robert | last2 =Tenenbaum | first2 =Laura | last3 =Varjas | first3 =Kris | last4 =Meyers | first4 =Joel | last5 =Jungert | first5 =Tomas | last6 =Vanegas | first6 =Gina | title =Bystander Motivation in Bullying Incidents: To Intervene or Not to Intervene? | journal =Western Journal of Emergency Medicine | volume =13 | issue =3 | pages =247–252 | publisher =National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine | date =August 2012 | language =  | doi =10.5811/westjem.2012.3.11792| pmc =3415829 | pmid =22900122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among adults, being a bystander to workplace bullying was linked to depression, particularly in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Jensen | first =I.

=== Of victims ===
Dr. Cook says that "A typical victim is likely to be aggressive, lack social skills, think negative thoughts, experience difficulties in solving social problems, come from a negative family, school and community environments and be noticeably rejected and isolated by peers".&lt;ref name="APS2010"/&gt; Victims often have characteristics such as being physically weak, as well as being easily distraught emotionally. They may also have physical characteristics that make them easier targets for bullies such as being overweight or having some type of physical deformity. Boys are more likely to be victims of physical bullying while girls are more likely to be bullied indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Paediatrics and Child Health|year= 2010 |volume=20 |issue=7|pages=315–320|last=Vanderbilt |first=Douglas |last2=Augustyn |first2=Marilyn |url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751722210000715|title=The effects of bullying |doi=10.1016/j.paed.2010.03.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of a  [[meta-analysis]] conducted by Cook and published by the [[American Psychological Association]] in 2010 concluded the main risk factors for children and adolescents being bullied, and also  for becoming bullies,  are the lack of [[social problem-solving]] skills.&lt;ref name="APS2010"/&gt;

Children who are bullied often show physical or emotional signs, such as: being afraid to attend school, complaining of headaches or a loss of appetite, a lack of interest in school activities and spending time with friends or family, and having an overall sense of sadness.

=== Violence ===
Serial killers were frequently bullied through direct and indirect methods as children or adolescents. [[Henry Lee Lucas]], a serial killer and diagnosed psychopath, said the ridicule and rejection he suffered as a child caused him to hate everyone which he believes to have evoked this behavior. [[Kenneth Bianchi]], a serial killer and member of the [[Hillside Stranglers]], was teased as a child because he urinated in his pants and suffered twitching, and as a teenager was ignored by his peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Scott |first=Shirley Lynn |title=What Makes Serial Killers Tick? |work=Crime library |publisher=Turner Entertainment Networks, Inc.

This violent behavior that is performed by these so-called serial killers allows these individuals to escape from their past of feeling trapped and weak to taking control over innocent victim.

=== Positive development ===
Some have argued that bullying can teach life lessons and instill strength. Helene Guldberg, a child development academic, sparked controversy when she argued that being a target of bullying can teach a child "how to manage disputes and boost their ability to interact with others", and that teachers should not intervene, but leave children to respond to the bullying themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =Tanya | title =Child Development Academician Says Bullying Is Beneficial To Kids | work =Med India | department =News | publisher =Medindia | date =2009-02-02 | url =http://www.medindia.net/news/Child-Development-Academician-Says-Bullying-Is-Beneficial-To-Kids-46992-1.htm | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131101060052/http://www.medindia.net/news/Child-Development-Academician-Says-Bullying-Is-Beneficial-To-Kids-46992-1.htm | archivedate =2013-11-01 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teaching of such anti-bullying coping skills to "would-be-targets" and to others has been found to be an effective long term means of reducing bullying incidence rates and a valuable skill-set for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.careforkids.com.au/childcarenews/2010/july/bullying.html Positive Anti-Bullying Strategies by Melissa Graham] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110160827/http://www.careforkids.com.au/childcarenews/2010/july/bullying.html |date=2013-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dark triad ==
{{Main article|Dark triad}}
Research on the dark triad ([[narcissism]], [[Machiavellianism]] and [[psychopathy]]) indicate a correlation with bullying as part of evidence of the aversive nature of those traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chabrol H. |author2=Van Leeuwen N. |author3=Rodgers R. |author4=Séjourné S.| year = 2009 | title = Contributions of psychopathic, narcissistic, Machiavellian, and sadistic personality traits to juvenile delinquency|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|volume =47|issue=7|pages=734–39|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2009.06.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projection ==
{{Main article|Psychological projection}}
A bully may project his/her own feelings of vulnerability onto the target(s) of the bullying activity.  Despite the fact that a bully's typically denigrating activities are aimed at the bully's targets, the true source of such negativity is ultimately almost always found in the bully's own sense of personal insecurity and/or vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gilbert, ''Overcoming Depression'' (1999) p.&amp;nbsp;185–6&lt;/ref&gt;  Such aggressive projections of displaced negative emotions can occur anywhere from the micro-level of interpersonal relationships, all the way up through to the macro-level of international politics, or even international armed conflict.&lt;ref name="micro and macro projection"&gt;Carl G. Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) p.&amp;nbsp;181–2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emotional intelligence ==
{{Main article|Bullying and emotional intelligence}}
Bullying is abusive social interaction between peers which can include aggression, harassment, and violence. Bullying is typically repetitive and enacted by those who are in a position of [[Abusive power and control|power]] over the victim. A growing body of research illustrates a significant relationship between bullying and [[emotional intelligence]] (EI). [[John D. Mayer|Mayer]] et al., (2008) defines the dimensions of overall EI as: "accurately perceiving emotion, using emotions to facilitate thought, understanding emotion, and managing emotion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Roberts | first2 = R.D | last3 = Barasade | first3 = S.G. | year = 2008 | title = Human abilities: Emotional intelligence | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 1| pages = 507–536 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093646 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept combines emotional and intellectual processes.&lt;ref name=Tolegenova &gt;Tolegenova, A.A., Jakupov, S.M., Man Cheung Chung, Saduova, S. &amp; Jakupov, M.S (2012) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.12.142 A theoretical formation of emotional intelligence and childhood trauma among adolescents.] "Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences", 69, 1891-1894. International Conference on Education and Educational Psychology (ICEEPSY 2012). {{DOI|10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.12.142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lower emotional intelligence appears to be related to involvement in bullying, as the bully and/or the victim of bullying. EI seems to play an important role in both bullying behavior and [[victimization]] in bullying; given that EI is illustrated to be malleable, EI education could greatly improve bullying prevention and intervention initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mckenna | first1 = J. | last2 = Webb | first2 = J. | year = 2013 | title = Emotional intelligence | url = | journal = British Journal of Occupational Therapy | volume = 76 | issue = 12| page = 560 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context ==
=== Cyberbullying ===
{{Main article|Cyberbullying}}
Cyberbullying is any bullying done through the use of technology. This form of bullying can easily go undetected because of lack of parental/authoritative supervision. Because bullies can pose as someone else, it is the most anonymous form of bullying. Cyberbullying includes, but is not limited to, abuse using email, instant messaging, text messaging, websites, social networking sites, etc.&lt;ref name="BoltonGraeve2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jose Bolton|author2=Stan Graeve|title=No Room for Bullies: From the Classroom to Cyberspace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOUWBckRIBIC|accessdate=2013-10-29|year=2005|publisher=Boys Town Press|isbn=978-1-889322-67-4|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101120429/http://books.google.com/books?id=WOUWBckRIBIC|archivedate=2014-01-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the creation of social networks like [[Facebook]], [[Myspace]], [[Instagram]], and [[Twitter]], cyberbullying has increased.

=== Disability bullying ===

It has been noted that disabled people are disproportionately affected by bullying and abuse, and such activity has been cited as a hate crime.&lt;ref name="Quarmby2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Katherine Quarmby|title=Scapegoat: Why We Are Failing Disabled People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lglMYgEACAAJ|accessdate=2013-10-29|year=2011|publisher=Portobello Books Limited|isbn=978-1-84627-321-6|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101120453/http://books.google.com/books?id=lglMYgEACAAJ|archivedate=2014-01-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bullying is not limited to those who are visibly disabled, such as wheelchair-users or physically deformed such as those with a cleft lip, but also those with learning disabilities, such as [[autism]]&lt;ref name="Sainsbury2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clare Sainsbury|title=Martian in the Playground: Understanding the Schoolchild with Asperger's Syndrome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TbGwEaH8eAIC|accessdate=2013-10-29|date=30 September 2009|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4462-4398-5|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101120424/http://books.google.com/books?id=TbGwEaH8eAIC|archivedate=1 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Attwood2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tony Attwood|title=The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZwQGsuCNMPYC|accessdate=2013-10-29|year=2006|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1-84310-495-7|pages=95–111|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101120355/http://books.google.com/books?id=ZwQGsuCNMPYC|archivedate=2014-01-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[developmental coordination disorder]].&lt;ref name="Kirby2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Amanda Kirby|title=Dyspraxia: The Hidden Handicap|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=so-3-vIf0lkC|accessdate=2013-10-29|date=1 October 2002|publisher=Souvenir Press|isbn=978-0-285-63512-8|pages=106–113|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101120440/http://books.google.com/books?id=so-3-vIf0lkC|archivedate=1 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brookes2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoff Brookes|title=Dyspraxia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZDqe-SckjIC|accessdate=2013-10-29|date=January 2005|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-8264-7581-7|pages=43–46|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101120352/http://books.google.com/books?id=wZDqe-SckjIC|archivedate=2014-01-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an additional problem that those with learning disabilities are often not as able to explain things to other people, so are more likely to be disbelieved or ignored if they do complain.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

=== Gay bullying ===
{{Main article|Gay bashing}}
Gay bullying and gay bashing designate direct or indirect [[verbal abuse|verbal]] or [[physical abuse|physical]] actions by a person or group against someone who is gay or lesbian, or perceived to be so due to rumors or because they are considered to fit gay stereotypes. Gay and lesbian youth are more likely than straight youth to report bullying.&lt;ref name="Berlan et al., 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Berlan | first =Elise D. | last2 =Corliss | first2 =Heather L. | last3 =Field | first3 =Alison E. | last4 =Goodman | first4 =Elizabeth | last5 =Austin | first5 =S.

=== Legal bullying ===
{{Main article|Legal abuse}}
Legal bullying is the bringing of a [[Vexatious litigation|vexatious legal action]] to control and punish a person.  Legal bullying can often take the form of frivolous, repetitive, or burdensome lawsuits brought to intimidate the defendant into submitting to the litigant's request, not because of the legal merit of the litigant's position, but principally due to the defendant's inability to maintain the legal battle.  This can also take the form of [[Strategic lawsuit against public participation|SLAPPs]].  It was partially concern about the potential for this kind of abuse that helped to fuel the [[protests against SOPA and PIPA]] in the United States in 2011 and 2012.

=== Military bullying ===
{{Main article|Bullying in the military}}
In 2000, the UK [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MOD) defined bullying as "the use of physical strength or the [[abuse of authority]] to intimidate or victimize others, or to give unlawful punishments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Dannatt | first =Sir Richard | title =Values and Standards of the British Army | chapter =Lawful: Paragraph 20 | publisher =the British Army | year =2008 | url =http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/v_s_of_the_british_army.pdf | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130817150435/http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/v_s_of_the_british_army.pdf | archivedate =2013-08-17 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that this behaviour should be allowed, due to ways in which "soldiering" is different from other occupations. Soldiers expected to risk their lives should, according to them, develop strength of body and spirit to accept bullying.&lt;ref name="CallaghanKernic2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean M.

=== Parental bullying of children ===
{{See also|Child abuse|Narcissistic parent|Parental narcissistic abuse}}
Parents who may [[Displacement (psychology)|displace]] their anger, insecurity, or a persistent need to dominate and [[Abusive power and control|control]] upon their children in excessive ways have been proven to increase the likelihood that their own children will in turn become overly aggressive or controlling towards their peers.&lt;ref name="parent bullying"&gt;{{cite web | last =Priesnitz | first =Wendy | title =Parental Bullying Creates Bullies | work =Natural Child Magazine | publisher =Wendy Priesnitz | url =http://www.naturalchildmagazine.com/news/parental_bullying_creates_bullies.htm | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131031134551/http://www.naturalchildmagazine.com/news/parental_bullying_creates_bullies.htm | archivedate =2013-10-31 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[American Psychological Association]] advises on its website that parents who may suspect that their own children may be engaging in bullying activities among their peers should carefully consider the examples which they themselves may be setting for their own children regarding how they typically interact with their own peers, colleagues, and children.&lt;ref name = "APA on parental bullying"&gt;{{cite web | title =Bullying: How parents, teachers, and kids can take action to prevent bullying | work =American Psychological Association | publisher =American Psychological Association | url = http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/bullying.aspx# | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prison bullying ===
{{Main article|Prisoner abuse}}
An environment known for bullying is a country's prison service. An additional complication is the staff and their relationships with the inmates. Thus the following possible bullying scenarios are possible:
* Inmate bullies inmate (echoing school bullying)
* Staff bullies inmate
* Staff bullies staff (a manifestation of workplace bullying)
* Inmate bullies staff

=== School bullying (bullying of students in schools) ===
{{Main article|School bullying}}
Bullying can occur in nearly any part in or around the school building, although it may occur more frequently during physical education classes and activities such as recess. Bullying also takes place in school hallways, bathrooms, on school buses and while waiting for buses, and in classes that require group work and/or after school activities. Bullying in school sometimes consists of a group of students taking advantage of or isolating one student in particular and gaining the loyalty of bystanders who want to avoid becoming the next target. In the 2011 documentary [[Bully (2011 film)|''Bully'']], we see first hand the torture that kids go through both in school and while on the school bus. As the movie follows around a few kids we see how bullying affects them both at school as well as in their homes. While bullying has no age limit, these bullies may taunt and tease their target before finally physically bullying them. Bystanders typically choose to either participate or watch, sometimes out of fear of becoming the next target.

Bullying can also be perpetrated by teachers and the school system itself; there is an inherent power differential in the system that can easily predispose to subtle or covert abuse ([[relational aggression]] or [[passive aggression]]), [[humiliation]], or exclusion — even while maintaining overt commitments to anti-bullying policies.&lt;ref name="GarbarinodeLara2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Garbarino|author2=Ellen deLara|title=And Words Can Hurt Forever: How to Protect Adolescents from Bullying, Harassment, and Emotional Violence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3XPx-OLgQjQC|accessdate=2013-10-29|date=2 September 2003|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-0-7432-2899-2|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101120850/http://books.google.com/books?id=3XPx-OLgQjQC|archivedate=1 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Witted | first =Kathryn Suzanne | title =Student Reports of Physical and Psychological Maltreatment in Schools: An Under Explored Aspect of Student Victimization in Schools | work =PhD dissertation, University of Tennessee | year =2005 | url =http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3874&amp;context=utk_graddiss | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131031121558/http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3874&amp;context=utk_graddiss | archivedate =2013-10-31 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1177/0013124507304487 |title=Do Teachers Bully Students?: Findings From a Survey of Students in an Alternative Education Setting |year=2007 |last1=Whitted |first1=K.

In 2016, in Canada, a North American legal precedent was set by a mother and her son, after the son was bullied in his public school. The mother and son won a court case against the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board, making this the first case in North America where a school board has been found negligent in a bullying case for failing to meet the standard of care (the "duty of care" that the school board owes to its students). Thus, it sets a precedent of a school board being found liable in negligence for harm caused to a child, because they failed to protect a child from the bullying actions of other students. There has been only one other similar bullying case and it was won in Australia in 2013 (Oyston v. St. Patricks College, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ottawacommunitynews.com/news-story/6773614-family-wins-precedent-setting-case-against-public-school-board/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210080755/http://www.ottawacommunitynews.com/news-story/6773614-family-wins-precedent-setting-case-against-public-school-board/ |archivedate=2017-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual bullying ===
{{Main article|Sexual bullying}}
{{See also|Slut-shaming}}
Sexual bullying is "Any bullying behaviour, whether physical or non-physical, that is based on a person's sexuality or gender. It is when sexuality or gender is used as a weapon by boys or girls towards other boys or girls – although it is more commonly directed at girls. It can be carried out to a person's face, behind their back or through the use of technology."&lt;ref name=NSPCC02&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w1.qehs.net/moodle2/pluginfile.php/10744/mod_resource/content/1/Sexual%20bullying.pdf |title=The NSPCC working definition of Sexual Bullying |publisher=[[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] |accessdate=13 September 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220065205/http://w1.qehs.net/moodle2/pluginfile.php/10744/mod_resource/content/1/Sexual%20bullying.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trans bullying ===
{{Main article|Trans bashing}}
'''Trans bashing''' is the act of [[victimizing]] a person physically, sexually, or verbally because they are [[transgender]] or [[Transsexualism|transsexual]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20774504-5005961,00.html Guilty plea over transsexual bashing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502173830/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0%2C21985%2C20774504-5005961%2C00.html |date=2008-05-02 }} By Mariza O'Keefe in ''Herald Sun''&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[gay bashing]], it is committed because of the target's actual or perceived [[gender identity]], not [[sexual orientation]].

=== Workplace bullying ===
{{Main article|Workplace bullying}}
Workplace bullying occurs when an employee experiences a persistent pattern of mistreatment from others in the workplace that causes harm.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, C. &amp; Keashley, L. (2005). Bullying at work: A perspective from Britain and North America. In S. Fox &amp; P. E. Spector (eds.) Counterproductive work behavior: Investigations of actors and targets (pp. 271-296). Washington DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Workplace bullying can include such tactics as [[verbal abuse|verbal]], [[nonverbal]], [[psychological abuse|psychological]], [[physical abuse|physical]] abuse and [[humiliation]]. This type of [[workplace aggression]] is particularly difficult because, unlike the typical forms of [[school bullying]], workplace bullies often operate within the established rules and policies of their organization and their society. Bullying in the workplace is in the majority of cases reported as having been perpetrated by someone in authority over the target. However, bullies can also be peers, and occasionally can be subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, C., &amp; Cooper, C. L. (2006). Workplace Bullying. In Kelloway, E., Barling, J. &amp; Hurrell Jr., J. (eds.), Handbook of workplace violence (pp. 47-90). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known documented use of "workplace bullying" is in 1992 in a book by [[Andrea Adams]] called ''Bullying at Work: How to Confront and Overcome It''.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=workplace+bullying&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1990&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2Cworkplace%20bullying%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bworkplace%20bullying%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BWorkplace%20Bullying%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BWorkplace%20bullying%3B%2Cc0 Google ngrams]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrea Adams|Adams, Andrea]] with contributions from Crawford, Neil ''Bullying at Work: How to Confront and Overcome It'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has also investigated the impact of the larger organizational context on bullying as well as the group-level processes that impact on the incidence, and maintenance of bullying behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, S., Troth, A &amp; Branch, S . (2010). Work-place bullying: A group processes framework ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 84(4), 799-816.''&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying can be covert or overt. It may be missed by superiors or known by many throughout the organization.  Negative effects are not limited to the targeted individuals, and may lead to a decline in [[employee morale]] and a change in [[organizational culture]].&lt;ref name="SilentEpidemic" /&gt; A [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane Collaboration]] [[systematic review]] has found very low quality [[Scientific evidence|evidence]] to suggest that organizational and individual interventions may prevent bullying behaviors in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009778.pub2/abstract|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|last=Gillen|first=Patricia A|last2=Sinclair|first2=Marlene|last3=Kernohan|first3=W George|last4=Begley|first4=Cecily M|last5=Luyben|first5=Ans G|date=2017-01-30|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|issn=1465-1858|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd009778.pub2/full|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307203800/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009778.pub2/abstract|archivedate=2017-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In academia ====
{{Main article|Bullying in academia}}
Bullying in academia is workplace bullying of scholars and staff in academia, especially places of higher education such as colleges and universities. It is believed to be common, although has not received as much attention from researchers as bullying in some other contexts.&lt;ref&gt;

==== In blue collar jobs ====
Bullying has been identified as prominent in blue collar jobs, including on oil rigs and in mechanic shops and machine shops. It is thought that intimidation and fear of retribution cause decreased incident reports. In industry sectors dominated by males, typically of little education, where disclosure of incidents are seen as effeminate, reporting in the socioeconomic and cultural milieu of such industries would likely lead to a [[vicious circle]]. This is often used in combination with [[psychological manipulation|manipulation]] and [[coercion]] of facts to gain favour among higher-ranking [[administrator (business)|administrators]].&lt;ref&gt;

==== In medicine ====
{{Main article|Bullying in medicine}}
Bullying in the [[medical profession]] is common, particularly of student or trainee doctors and of nurses. It is thought that this is at least in part an outcome of conservative traditional hierarchical structures and teaching methods in the medical profession, which may result in a bullying cycle.

==== In nursing ====
{{Main article|Bullying in nursing}}
Even though The [[American Nurses Association]] believes that all nursing personnel have the right to work in safe, non-abusive environments, bullying has been identified as being particularly prevalent in the nursing profession although the reasons are not clear. It is thought that relational aggression (psychological aspects of bullying such as gossipping and intimidation) are relevant. Relational aggression has been studied among girls but not so much among adult women.&lt;ref name="RichardsEdwards2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nursingworld.org/Bullying-Workplace-Violence Workplace Violence Statistics {{cite journal | last =Dellasega | first =Cheryl A. | title =Bullying Among Nurses | journal =American Journal of Nursing | volume =109 | issue =1 | pages =52–58 | publisher =Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins | year =2009 | url =http://journals.lww.com/ajnonline/Abstract/2009/01000/Bullying_Among_Nurses.28.aspx | doi =10.1097/01.NAJ.0000344039.11651.08 | accessdate =2013-10-28 | pmid =19112267 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131031224030/http://journals.lww.com/ajnonline/Abstract/2009/01000/Bullying_Among_Nurses.28.aspx | archivedate =2013-10-31 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the verb ''to bully'' is defined as simply "forcing one's way aggressively or by intimidation", the term may generally apply to any life experience where one is motivated primarily by intimidation instead of by more positive goals, such as mutually shared interests and benefits. As such, any figure of authority or power who may use intimidation as a primary means of motivating others, such as a neighborhood "protection racket don", a national dictator, a childhood ring-leader, a terrorist, a terrorist organization, or even a ruthless business CEO, could rightfully be referred to as a bully. According to psychologist Pauline Rennie-Peyton, we each face the possibility of being bullied in any phase of our lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Karim | first =Nadiya | title =Bullying in Universities: It exists | newspaper =The Independent | department =News: Education: Higher | publisher =The Independent | date =2010-01-15 | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/bullying-in-universities-it-exists-1869267.html | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131216063925/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/bullying-in-universities-it-exists-1869267.html | archivedate =2013-12-16 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inanimate objects ===
Children have been observed bullying anthropomorphic robots designed to assist the elderly. Their attacks start with blocking the robots' paths of movement and then escalate to verbal abuse, hitting and destroying the object. Seventy-five percent of the kids interviewed perceived the robot as "human-like" yet decided to abuse it anyway, while 35% of the kids who beat up the robot actually did so "for enjoyment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/kids-attack-bully-robot-japanese-mall-danger-avoidance-ai-2015-8?IR=T|title=Scientists are teaching robots to avoid children — because kids can be surprisingly mean|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-11-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Responding to bullying ==
Bullying is typically ongoing and not isolated behaviour.  Common ways that people try to respond, are to try to ignore it, to confront the bullies or to turn to an authority figure to try and address it.

Ignoring it often does nothing to stop the bullying continuing, and it can become worse over time.&lt;ref&gt;W. Craig et al., [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0143034307084136 "Responding to bullying, what works"]&lt;/ref&gt;
It can be important to address bullying behaviour early on, as it can be easier to control the earlier it is detected.&lt;ref&gt;W. Ci, [https://carleton.ca/economics/wp-content/uploads/bullying_paper_1-6.pdf "What can be done to stop bullying among children? Evidence from Canada"]&lt;/ref&gt;
Bystanders play an important role in responding to bullying, as doing nothing can encourage it to continue, while small steps that oppose the behaviour can reduce it.&lt;ref&gt;Bully-zero Australia Foundation, [http://bzaf.org.au/respond-to-bullying/ "Respond to bullying"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Authority figures can play an important role, such as parents in child or adolescent situations, or supervisors, human-resources staff or parent-bodies in workplace and volunteer settings.  Authority figures can be influential in recognising and stopping bullying behaviour, and creating an environment where it doesn't continue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stopbullying.gov/respond/on-the-spot/index.html "Stop bullying on the spot"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Safe work Australia, [https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/guide-preventing-and-responding-workplace-bullying "Guide for preventing and responding to workplace bullying"]&lt;/ref&gt;
In many situations however people acting as authority figures are untrained and unqualified, do not know how to respond, and can make the situation worse.&lt;ref&gt;Veronica Birkett, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/bullied-dont-tell-the-teacher-1361862.html "Bullied? Don't tell the teacher"]&lt;/ref&gt;
In some cases the authority figures even support the people doing the bullying, facilitating it continuing and increasing the isolation and marginalising of the target.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ethicsinvolunteering.wordpress.com/responding-to-bullying-in-arc-unsw-sports/ "Responding to bullying in Arc UNSW sports"]&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the most effective ways to respond, are to recognise that harmful behaviour is taking place, and creating an environment where it won't continue.&lt;ref name=field03&gt;E. Field, [http://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/house_of_representatives_committees?url=ee/bullying/subs/sub58.pdf "The prevalence of workplace bullying in Australia"]&lt;/ref&gt;
People that are being targeted have little control over which authority figures they can turn to and how such matters would be addressed, however one means of support is to find a counsellor or psychologist that is trained in handling bullying.

== Etymology ==
The word "[[bully]]" was first used in the 1530s meaning "sweetheart", applied to either sex, from the Dutch ''boel'' "lover, brother", probably diminutive of [[Middle High German]] ''buole'' "brother", of uncertain origin (compare with the German ''buhle'' "lover"). The meaning deteriorated through the 17th century through "fine fellow", "blusterer", to "harasser of the weak". This may have been as a connecting sense between "lover" and "ruffian" as in "protector of a prostitute", which was one sense of "bully" (though not specifically attested until 1706). The verb "to bully" is first attested in 1710.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =bully | work =Online Etymology Dictionary | publisher =Douglas Harper | url =http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bully | accessdate =2013-10-28 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195402/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bully | archivedate =2013-10-29 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, in American culture, the term has been used differently, as an exclamation/exhortation, in particular famously associated with [[Theodore Roosevelt]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shapell.org/manuscript/theodore-roosevelt-bully-for-you ''TR Correspondence 27 September 1907''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416024951/http://www.shapell.org/manuscript/theodore-roosevelt-bully-for-you |date=16 April 2016 }} "bully for you" in the positive sense&lt;/ref&gt; and continuing to the present in the [[bully pulpit]] and also as faint/deprecating praise ("bully for him").
