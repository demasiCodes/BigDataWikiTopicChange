The '''Law for protection of the nation''' ({{lang-bg|Закон за защита на нацията — ЗЗН}}) was a [[Bulgaria]]n law, effective from 23 January 1941 to 27 November 1944, which directed measures against [[Jews]] and others. This law was passed along the example of the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in [[Nazi Germany]].

The law ordered measures for:
*Changes in the names of Jews
*Rules about their place of residence
*Confiscation of their possessions
*Their exclusion from the public service
*Prohibition of economic and professional activity

Citizens of Jewish origin were also banned from certain public areas, restricted economically, and marriages between Jews and Bulgarians were prohibited. Jews were forced to pay a one-time tax of 20 percent of their [[net worth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marushiakova|first=Elena|author2=Vesselin Popov|contribution=Bulgarian Romanies: The Second World War|title=The Gypsies during the Second World War|publisher=[[Univ of Hertfordshire Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-900458-85-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischel|first=Jack|title=The Holocaust|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1998|page=69|isbn=0-313-29879-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wyman|first=David S.| authorlink =David Wyman|author2=Charles H.

This law suppressed all [[Freemasonry|Freemasonry lodges]] and all other secret organizations.

The Law for protection of the nation, was passed under direct influence from [[Nazi Germany]], but did not lead to the deportation of the [[Bulgarian Jews]] to [[Nazi extermination camps]], except for the Jewish people from former Greek and Yugolavian territories occupied by Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dikovski |first=Antoinette |title=България само администрираше "новите земи" |publisher=Демокрация |date=2000-07-19 |accessdate=2015-03-07|language=Bulgarian |url=http://www.eunet.bg/bgnews/show_story.html?issue=207309408&amp;media=1523776&amp;class=3712256&amp;story=207312704 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110718022252/http://www.eunet.bg/bgnews/show_story.html?issue=207309408&amp;media=1523776&amp;class=3712256&amp;story=207312704|archivedate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
