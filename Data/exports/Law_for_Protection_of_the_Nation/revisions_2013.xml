The '''Law for protection of the nation''' ({{lang-bg|Закон за защита на нацията — ЗЗН}}) was a [[Bulgaria]]n law, effective from 23 January 1941 to 27 November 1944, which directed measures against [[Jews]] and others. This law was passed along the example of the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in [[Nazi Germany]].

The law ordered measures for:
*Changes in the names of Jews
*Rules about their place of residence
*Confiscation of their possessions
*Their exclusion from the public service
*Prohibition of economic and professional activity

Citizens of Jewish origin were also banned from public areas, restricted economically, and marriages between Jews were prohibited.

This law suppressed all [[Freemasonry|Freemasonry lodges]] and all other secret organizations.

The Law for protection of the nation, was passed under direct influence from [[Nazi Germany]], but didn't lead to the deportation of the [[Bulgarian Jews]] to [[Nazi extermination camps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=България само администрираше „новите земи“ |publisher=Демокрация |date=2007-07-19 |accessdate=2007-03-28 |language=Bulgarian |url=http://www.eunet.bg/bgnews/show_story.html?issue=207309408&amp;media=1523776&amp;class=3712256&amp;story=207312704 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
