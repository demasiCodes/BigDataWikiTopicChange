The '''Law for protection of the nation''' ({{lang-bg|Закон за защита на нацията — ЗЗН}}) was a [[Bulgaria]]n law, effective from [[23 January]] [[1941]] to [[27 November]] [[1944]], which directed measures against [[Jews]]. This law was passed after the example of the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in the [[Nazi Germany|German Reich]].

The law ordered measures for:
*Changes in the names of the Jews
*Rules about their place of residence
*Deprivation of their possessions
*Their exclusion of the public service
*Prohibition of economic and  professional activity

The citizens of Jewish origin were also banned from public areas, restricted economically; the marriages between Jews were prohibited.

This law suppressed all [[Freemasonry|Freemasonry lodges]] and all another secret organizations.

The Law for protection of the nation, passed under direct influence from [[Nazi Germany]], was vigorously opposed by notable Bulgarian intellectuals, and the public opposition to the deportation of the [[Bulgarian Jews]] to [[Nazi extermination camps]] ultimately resulted in its prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=България само администрираше „новите земи“ |publisher=Демокрация |date=2007-07-19 |accessdate=2007-03-28 |language=Bulgarian |url=http://www.eunet.bg/bgnews/show_story.html?issue=207309408&amp;media=1523776&amp;class=3712256&amp;story=207312704 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
