The '''crime of apartheid''' is defined by the 2002 [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] which established the [[International Criminal Court]] as inhumane acts of a character similar to other [[crimes against humanity]] "committed in the context of an institutionalised regime of systematic [[oppression]] and [[Dominance hierarchy|domination]] by one [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial group]] over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime." It lists such crimes as [[murder]], [[slavery|enslavement]], deprivation of physical [[liberty]], [[forced relocation]], [[sexual violence]], and [[collective persecution]].&lt;ref name="rome_art5"&gt;{{cite web

The term ''[[Wiktionary:apartheid|apartheid]]'', from [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] for "apartness," was the official name of the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|South African system of racial segregation]] which existed after 1948. Complaints about the system were brought to the United Nations as early as 12 July 1948 when Dr. Padmanabha Pillai, the representative of [[India]] to the United Nations, circulated a letter to the Secretary-General expressing his concerns over treatment of ethnic Indians within the [[Union of South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1971, the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] and [[Guinea]] together submitted early drafts of a convention to deal with the suppression and punishment of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

"As such, apartheid was declared to be a [[crime against humanity]], with a scope that went far beyond South Africa. While the crime of apartheid is most often associated with the racist policies of South Africa after 1948, the term more generally refers to racially based policies in any state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Seventy-six other countries subsequently signed on, but a number of nations have neither signed nor ratified the ICSPCA, including Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/english/countries/ratification/7.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In explanation of the US vote against the convention, Ambassador [[Clarence Clyde Ferguson Jr.]] said: "[W]e cannot...accept that apartheid can in this manner be made a crime against humanity. Crimes against humanity are so grave in  nature that they must be meticulously elaborated and strictly construed under existing international law..."&lt;ref&gt;Statement by Ambassador Clarence Clyde Ferguson Jr. before General Assembly in explanation of vote on Apartheid Convention, 30 November 1973.

The [[International Criminal Court]] provides for individual criminal responsibility for crimes against humanity,&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica'', "[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-233522 Nonstate actors in international law]".  Retrieved on 12 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; including the crime of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm Article 7] of the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] specifically lists the "crime of apartheid" as one of eleven recognized crimes against humanity.&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Criminal Court (ICC) came into being on 1 July 2002, and can only prosecute crimes committed on or after that date.  The Court can generally only exercise jurisdiction in cases where the accused is a national of a state party, the alleged crime took place on the territory of a state party, or a situation is referred to the Court by the [[United Nations Security Council]].  As of July 2008, 106 countries are [[States Parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|states parties]] (with [[Suriname]] and [[Cook Islands]] set to join in October 2008), and a further 40 countries have signed but not yet ratified the treaty.&lt;ref name=untreaty&gt;United Nations.

Accessed 16 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, many of the world's most populous nations, including [[China]], [[India]], the [[United States]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Pakistan]] are not parties to the Court and therefore are not subject to its jurisdiction, except by Security Council referral.
