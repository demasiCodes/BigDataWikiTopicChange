The '''crime of apartheid''' is defined by the 2002 [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] as inhumane acts of a character similar to other [[crimes against humanity]] "committed in the context of an institutionalized regime of systematic [[oppression]] and [[Dominance hierarchy|domination]] by one [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial group]] over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime".

On 30 November 1973, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] opened for signature and ratification [[The International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid]].&lt;ref name="ICSPCA"&gt;[http://legal.un.org/avl/ha/cspca/cspca.html International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid], retrieved on 10 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It defined the crime of apartheid as "inhuman acts committed for the purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically oppressing them".&lt;ref name="text_ICSPCA"&gt;[http://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.10_International%20Convention%20on%20the%20Suppression%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Apartheid.pdf Text of the ''International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{International opposition to Apartheid}}
The term ''[[Wiktionary:apartheid|apartheid]]'', from [[Afrikaans]] for "apartness", was the official name of the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|South African system of racial segregation]] which existed after 1948. Complaints about the system were brought to the United Nations as early as 12 July 1948 when Dr. Padmanabha Pillai, the representative of [[India]] to the United Nations, circulated a letter to the Secretary-General expressing his concerns over treatment of ethnic Indians within the [[Union of South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it became more widely known, South African apartheid was condemned internationally as unjust and [[racist]] and many decided that a formal legal framework was needed in order to apply international pressure on the South African government.

In 1971, the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Guinea]] together submitted early drafts of a convention to deal with the suppression and punishment of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

"As such, apartheid was declared to be a [[crime against humanity]], with a scope that went far beyond South Africa. While the crime of apartheid is most often associated with the racist policies of South Africa after 1948, the term more generally refers to racially based policies in any state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Seventy-six other countries subsequently signed on, but a number of nations, including western democracies, have neither signed nor ratified the ICSPCA, including [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-7&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en List of signatories to the ICSPCA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718122932/http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-7&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |date=July 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In explanation of the US vote against the convention, Ambassador [[Clarence Clyde Ferguson Jr.]] said: "[W]e cannot... accept that apartheid can in this manner be made a crime against humanity.

In 1977, Addition Protocol 1 to the Geneva Conventions designated apartheid as a grave breach of the Protocol and a war crime. There are 169 parties to the Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;See Article 85(4) and 85(5) of Additional Protocol 1, dated 8 June 1977 [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e636b/f6c8b9fee14a77fdc125641e0052b079]&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Criminal Court (ICC) came into being on 1 July 2002, and can only prosecute crimes committed on or after that date.  The Court can generally only exercise jurisdiction in cases where the accused is a national of a state party, the alleged crime took place on the territory of a state party, or a situation is referred to the Court by the [[United Nations Security Council]]. The ICC exercises complimentary jurisdiction. Many of the member states have provided their own national courts with universal jurisdiction over the same offenses and do not recognize any statute of limitations for crimes against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/law/hrlc/international-criminal-justice-unit/implementation-database.php |title=Database of National Implementing Legislation |access-date=2009-07-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706002816/http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/law/hrlc/international-criminal-justice-unit/implementation-database.php |archive-date=2008-07-06 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2008, 106 countries are [[States Parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|states parties]] (with [[Suriname]] and [[Cook Islands]] set to join in October 2008), and a further 40 countries have signed but not yet ratified the treaty.&lt;ref name=untreaty&gt;United Nations.

==ICSPCA definition of the crime of apartheid==
[[File:ICSPCA-members.PNG|thumb|upright=1.5|Signatories to the 1973 International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid: parties in dark green, signed but not ratified in light green, non-members in grey]]
Article II of the ICSPCA defines the crime of apartheid as below:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;&gt;'''International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid,'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Article II'''&lt;ref name="ICSPCA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="text_ICSPCA"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

For the purpose of the present Convention, the term 'the crime of apartheid', which shall include similar policies and practices of [[racial segregation]] and discrimination as practiced in [[southern Africa]], shall apply to the following [[inhumane]] acts committed for the purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial group]] of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically oppressing them:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{ordered list|type=lower-alpha
| 1 = Denial to a member or members of a racial group or groups of the [[right to life]] and [[liberty]] of person
{{ordered list|type=lower-roman
  | 1 = By murder of members of a racial group or groups;
  | 2 = By the infliction upon the members of a racial group or groups of serious [[bodily harm|bodily]] or [[Psychological trauma|mental harm]], by the infringement of their freedom or dignity, or by subjecting them to [[torture]] or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;
  | 3 = By [[arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary arrest]] and illegal imprisonment of the members of a racial group or groups;
  }}
| 2 = Deliberate imposition on a racial group or groups of living conditions calculated to cause its or their [[Genocide|physical destruction]] in whole or in part;
| 3 = Any legislative measures and other measures calculated to prevent a racial group or groups from participation in the political, social, economic and cultural life of the country and the deliberate creation of conditions preventing the full development of such a group or groups, in particular by denying to members of a racial group or groups basic human rights and freedoms, including the [[right to work]], the right to form recognised [[trade unions]], the right to education, the [[Illegal emigration|right to leave]] and [[Right of return|to return]] to their country, the [[Nationality law|right to a nationality]], the right to [[freedom of movement]] and residence, the right to [[freedom of expression|freedom of opinion and expression]], and the right to [[Freedom of assembly|freedom of peaceful assembly]] and [[Freedom of association|association]];
| 4 = Any measures including legislative measures, designed to divide the population along racial lines by the creation of separate reserves and [[ghetto]]s for the members of a racial group or groups, the prohibition of [[Interracial marriage|mixed marriage]]s among members of various racial groups, the [[Nationalization|expropriation]] of landed property belonging to a racial group or groups or to members thereof;
| 5 = Exploitation of the labour of the members of a racial group or groups, in particular by submitting them to [[forced labour]];
| 6 = [[Persecution]] of organizations and persons, by depriving them of fundamental rights and freedoms, because they oppose [[apartheid]].
}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Definition of racial discrimination===
According to the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]],
{{quote|the term "racial discrimination" shall mean any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, [[Cultural heritage|descent]], or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of [[human rights]] and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hri.org/docs/ICERD66.html UN International Convention on the Elimination of All of Racial Discrimination], New York 7 March 1966&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This definition does not make any difference between discrimination based on [[ethnicity]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], in part because the distinction between the two remains debatable among [[Anthropology|anthropologists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. |last=Metraux |year=1950 |title=United nations Economic and Security Council Statement by Experts on Problems of Race |journal=[[American Anthropologist]] |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=142–145 |doi=10.1525/aa.1951.53.1.02a00370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in British law the phrase ''racial group'' means "any group of people who are defined by reference to their race, colour, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/prosecution/rrpbcrbook.html |title=Racist and Religious Crime – CPS Prosecution Policy |publisher=The CPS |access-date=2010-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119032241/http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/prosecution/rrpbcrbook.html |archive-date=2010-01-19 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 7 of the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] defines crimes against humanity as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

  |6 = [[Torture]];
  |7 = Rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity;
  |8 = Persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender as defined in paragraph 3, or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law, in connection with any act referred to in this paragraph or any crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;
  |9 = Enforced disappearance of persons;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The 'crime of apartheid' means inhumane acts of a character similar to those referred to in paragraph 1, committed in the context of an institutionalised regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Accusations of apartheid by country==

===China===

The privileging of the [[Han people]] in ethnic minority areas outside of [[China proper]], such as the [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]]-majority [[Xinjiang]] and the central government's [[Chinese settlements in Tibet|policy of settlement]] in [[Tibet]], and the alleged erosion of indigenous religion, language and culture through repressive measures (such as the Han [[Bingtuan]] militia in Xinjiang) and [[sinicization]] have been likened to "cultural genocide" and apartheid by some activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Seytoff |first1=Alim A |title=China's Uighurs claim cultural 'genocide' |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/06/china-uighurs-claim-cultural-gen-20146165946224857.html |access-date=14 August 2018 |work=Al Jazeera |date=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Apartheid with Chinese characteristics: China has turned Xinjiang into a police state like no other |url=https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/05/31/china-has-turned-xinjiang-into-a-police-state-like-no-other |access-date=14 August 2018 |work=The Economist |date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regards to [[Chinese settlements in Tibet]], in 1991 the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] declared:&lt;ref name="Dalai"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1347735.stm "Profile: The Dalai Lama"], ''[[BBC News]]'', April 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United States Congressional Serial Set, United States Government Printing Office, 1993, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; The new Chinese settlers have created an alternate society: a Chinese apartheid which, denying Tibetans equal social and economic status in our own land, threatens to finally overwhelm and absorb us.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Additionally, the traditional residential system of ''[[hukou]]'' has been likened to apartheid due to its classification of 'rural' and 'urban' residency status,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The rural-urban divide: Ending apartheid |url=https://www.economist.com/special-report/2014/04/19/ending-apartheid |access-date=14 August 2018 |work=The Economist|url-access=subscription  |date=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=China rethinks peasant 'apartheid' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4424944.stm |access-date=14 August 2018 |work=BBC News |date=10 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is sometimes likened to a form of [[caste]] system.&lt;ref&gt;"Chinese Society: Change, Conflict and Resistance", by Elizabeth J.

In part, the report cited the explicit non-citizenship of the Palestinians living under military occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the denying of Palestinian refugees a right to return to Israel. Even alleging the existence of apartheid within Israel's 1949 Armistice Agreement lines, the report described Israel's Arab citizens as being subject to "more than 50 discriminatory laws" and receiving "inferior social services, restrictive zoning laws, and limited budget allocations benefitting their communities."&lt;ref&gt;Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, [https://electronicintifada.net/sites/default/files/2017-03/un_apartheid_report_15_march_english_final_.pdf Israeli Practices towards the Palestinian People and the Question of Apartheid: Palestine and the Israeli Occupation], Issue No. 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2021, the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem released a report denouncing "Israeli apartheid" and describing Israel as "A regime of Jewish supremacy from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea." Also referring to apartheid within Israel's own borders, and not just the post-1967 occupied territories, B'Tselem pointed out how Israeli Arabs' local councils and communities, despite representing 17% of the country's citizenry, "have access to less than 3% of the country’s total area."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.btselem.org/publications/fulltext/202101_this_is_apartheid A regime of Jewish supremacy from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea: This is apartheid]".

[[South Africa]]n judge [[Richard Goldstone]], head of the Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, also known as the [[Goldstone Report]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in October 2011, said that "in Israel, there is no apartheid. Nothing there comes close to the definition of apartheid under the 1998 Rome Statute." Goldstone noted that [[Arab citizens of Israel]] are allowed to vote, have political parties, and hold seats in the [[Knesset]] and other positions, including one on the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israeli Supreme Court]]. Goldstone wrote that the situation in the West Bank was more complex, but that there is no attempt to maintain "an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group", and claimed that the seemingly oppressive measures taken by Israel were taken to protect its own citizens from attacks by Palestinian militants.&lt;ref name="Goldstone2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/01/opinion/israel-and-the-apartheid-slander.html |title=Israel and the Apartheid Slander |first=Richard J. |last=Goldstone |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 31, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacques de Maio, head of International Committee of the Red Cross delegation to Israel and the Palestinian Authority, stated that in Israel-Palestine, 'there is a bloody national conflict, whose most prominent and tragic characteristic is its continuation over the years, decades-long, and there is a state of occupation,' but that there was 'not apartheid.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=2017-04-26|title=ICRC official: Israel is not an apartheid state, but there is occupation|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4953648,00.html|access-date=2021-07-30|website=Ynetnews|language=en|last1=Plocker|first1=Sever}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Myanmar===
Since Myanmar's transition to relative democratic rule beginning in 2010, the government's response to the [[Rohingya genocide]] has been widely condemned, and has been described as an [[ethnic cleansing]] by the [[United Nations]], [[International Criminal Court|ICC]] officials, and other governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/myanmar-mass-graves-latest-rohingya-slaughter-genocide-ap/|title=AP finds mass graves, latest evidence of Rohingya genocide in Myanmar|access-date=10 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411174445/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/myanmar-mass-graves-latest-rohingya-slaughter-genocide-ap/|archive-date=11 April 2018|url-status=live|work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-myanmar-rohingyas-20180313-story.html|title=U.N. genocide advisor: Myanmar waged 'scorched-earth campaign' against the Rohingya|access-date=10 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411174500/http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-myanmar-rohingyas-20180313-story.html|archive-date=11 April 2018|url-status=live|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/12/asia/myanmar-rohingya-un-violence-genocide-intl/index.html|title=UN official convinced of Myanmar Rohingya 'genocide'|access-date=10 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411174221/https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/12/asia/myanmar-rohingya-un-violence-genocide-intl/index.html|archive-date=11 April 2018|url-status=live|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/un-security-council-end-disgraceful-inaction-on-myanmars-rohingya-crisis/|title=UN Security Council: End disgraceful inaction on Myanmar's Rohingya crisis|publisher=Amnesty International|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411174225/https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/un-security-council-end-disgraceful-inaction-on-myanmars-rohingya-crisis/|archive-date=11 April 2018|url-status=dead|access-date=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/22/politics/tillerson-myanmar-ethnic-cleansing/index.html|title=Tillerson: Myanmar clearly 'ethnic cleansing' the Rohingya|access-date=10 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410132738/https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/22/politics/tillerson-myanmar-ethnic-cleansing/index.html|archive-date=10 April 2018|url-status=live|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burma-Mass-Destruction"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/10/17/burma-new-satellite-images-confirm-mass-destruction|title=Burma: New Satellite Images Confirm Mass Destruction|date=17 October 2017|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106003237/https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/10/17/burma-new-satellite-images-confirm-mass-destruction|archive-date=6 January 2018|url-status=live|access-date=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myanmar's current policies towards the [[Rohingya]] population include ethnic segregation, limited access to resources (comparable to the bantustan system), a lack of civil rights, ID card and special permit systems without any guarantee of citizenship (akin to the [[pass laws]]), restrictions on movement, and even institutionalized racial definitions, with the Rohingya being officially labelled as "Bengali races".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Myanmar: Rohingya trapped in dehumanising apartheid regime |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/11/myanmar-rohingya-trapped-in-dehumanising-apartheid-regime/ |website=Amnesty International |date=21 November 2017 |access-date=11 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the UN has explicitly condemned Myanmar over creating an apartheid state, threatening to withdraw aid from the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McCarthy |first1=Joe |title=UN Accuses Myanmar of Creating 'Apartheid State' and Threatens to Withhold Aid |url=https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/rohingya-myanmar-apartheid/ |access-date=11 May 2020 |publisher=Global Citizen |date=17 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Korea===
[[File:Demilitarized Zone of Korea 03.JPG|thumb|Pro-[[Korean unification|unification]] propaganda on the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]]]]
Some commentators have compared modern-day [[North Korea]] to apartheid South Africa. In an anonymous [[News24 (website)|News24]] opinion piece, the [[African National Congress Youth League]] was criticized for its praise of former North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-il]] after his [[Death and state funeral of Kim Jong-il|death]] (the North Koreans provided support to the [[African National Congress]] and other anti-apartheid movements). Parallels were made between North Korea and apartheid South Africa, including institutionalized ideas of racial purity, the heavy restrictions on letting foreign citizens live in the country, and the living conditions in North Korea outside of [[Pyongyang]] being compared to South Africa's [[bantustan]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=North Korea an 'Apartheid' State |url=https://www.news24.com/MyNews24/North-Korea-an-Apartheid-State-20111228 |website=News24.com |publisher=Naspers Limited |access-date=2 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other points of comparison have included the ''[[songbun]]'' system being equivalent to the [[Population Registration Act, 1950|Population Registration Act]], both states having developed nuclear weapons for self-defense purposes, international isolation, and the proliferation of race myths in national history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Noland |first1=Marcus |title=Myers, Apartheid, and Engagement with North Korea |url=https://www.piie.com/blogs/north-korea-witness-transformation/myers-apartheid-and-engagement-north-korea |website=Pierson Institute for International Economics |date=11 February 2014 |access-date=2 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saudi Arabia===

{{main|Saudi Arabia and the apartheid analogy}}
Saudi Arabia's treatment of religious minorities has been described by both Saudis and non-Saudis as "[[apartheid]]" and "religious apartheid".&lt;ref&gt;Saudi Institute (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Dershowitz]] wrote in 2002, "in Saudi Arabia apartheid is practiced against non-Muslims, with signs indicating that Muslims must go to certain areas and non-Muslims to others."&lt;ref&gt;Alan M. Dershowitz, [http://www.jewishworldreview.com/1102/alien_visit.asp Treatment of Israel strikes an alien note], Jewish World Review, November 8, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Amir Taheri]] quoted a Shi'ite businessman from [[Dhahran]] as saying "It is not normal that there are no Shi'ite army officers, ministers, governors, mayors and ambassadors in this kingdom. This form of religious apartheid is as intolerable as was apartheid based on race."&lt;ref&gt;Taheri (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Testifying before the [[Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission|U.S. Congressional Human Rights Caucus]] on 4 June 2002, in a briefing entitled "Human Rights in Saudi Arabia: The Role of Women", Ali Al-Ahmed, Director of the Saudi Institute, stated:&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Human Rights Caucus (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Saudi Arabia is a glaring example of religious apartheid. The religious institutions from government clerics to judges, to religious curricula, and all religious instructions in media are restricted to the [[Wahhabism|Wahhabi]] understanding of [[Islam]], adhered to by less than 40% of the population. The Saudi government communized Islam, through its monopoly of both religious thoughts and practice. Wahhabi Islam is imposed and enforced on all Saudis regardless of their religious orientations. The Wahhabi sect does not tolerate other religious or ideological beliefs, Muslim or not. Religious symbols by Muslims, [[Christianity|Christians]], [[Judaism|Jews]] and other believers are all banned. The Saudi embassy in Washington is a living example of religious apartheid. In its 50 years, there has not been a single non-Sunni Muslim diplomat in the embassy. The branch of [[Imam Mohamed Bin Saud University]] in Fairfax, Virginia instructs its students that [[Shia Islam]] is a Jewish conspiracy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 14 December 2005, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Representative [[Shelley Berkley]] introduced a bill in Congress urging American divestiture from Saudi Arabia, and giving as its rationale (among other things) "Saudi Arabia is a country that practices religious apartheid and continuously subjugates its citizenry, both Muslim and non-Muslim, to a specific interpretation of Islam."&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:H.R.4543.IH: To express the policy of the United States to ensure the divestiture...] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318011841/http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:H.R.4543.IH: |date=2015-03-18 }} 109th CONGRESS, 1st Session, H.

===South Africa===
{{main|Apartheid in South Africa}}
The name of the crime comes from a system of racial segregation in South Africa enforced through legislation by the National Party (NP), the governing party from 1948 to 1994. Under apartheid, the rights, associations, and movements of the majority black inhabitants and other ethnic groups were curtailed, and white minority rule was maintained. Notably, South Africa's post-apartheid Constitution does not mention or prohibit the crime of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mboti |first1=Nyasha |title=Circuits of apartheid: A Plea for Apartheid Studies |journal=Glimpse |date=2019 |volume=20 |pages=15–70 |doi=10.5840/glimpse2019202 |s2cid=211445267 |url=https://www.pdcnet.org/glimpse/content/glimpse_2019_0020_0015_0070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sudan===
{{see|Sudan and the apartheid analogy}}
In early 1991, non-Arabs of the Zaghawa tribe of Sudan attested that they were victims of an intensifying Arab [[apartheid]] campaign, segregating Arabs and non-Arabs.&lt;ref name="Johnson2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=Hilde F. |last=Johnson|title=Waging Peace in Sudan: The Inside Story of the Negotiations that Ended Africa's Longest Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WhlarBGyoQQC|year=2011|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-84519-453-6 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sudanese Arabs, who controlled the government, were widely referred to as practicing apartheid against Sudan's non-Arab citizens. The government was accused of "deftly manipulat(ing) Arab solidarity" to carry out policies of apartheid and ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref name="Lasaga"&gt;Vukoni Lupa Lasaga, "The slow, violent death of apartheid in Sudan," 19 September 2006, Norwegian Council for Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American University]] economist [[George Ayittey]] accused the Arab government of Sudan of practicing acts of racism against black citizens.&lt;ref&gt;George Ayittey, Africa and China, [[The Economist]], 19 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ayittey, "In Sudan... the Arabs monopolized power and excluded blacks – Arab apartheid."&lt;ref&gt;"How the Multilateral Institutions Compounded Africa's Economic Crisis", George B.N.

===United States===

Some observers have described the [[United States]] as an apartheid state based on examples of systemic oppression against African Americans, Indigenous peoples, other peoples of color, and disabled individuals. A 1994 paper on "The Legacy of American Apartheid and Environmental Racism" by scholar Robert Bullard described housing discrimination, residential segregation, and differential exposure to air pollution as evidence of ongoing "Apartheid American Style".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bullard, "The Legacy of American Apartheid and Environmental Racism," ''Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development'' 2, no. 9 (2004):445-474.&lt;/ref&gt; Michelle Alexander has referred to the country's disproportionate incarceration of African Americans as "a form of apartheid unlike any the world has ever seen," since it puts the victims behind bars rather than "merely shunting black people to the other side of town or corralling them in ghettos."&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Alexander, ''The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Color Blindness'' (New York: The New Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The Lower Brule Sioux Tribe author Nick Estes has referred to the United States' history of pushing Indigenous nations onto smaller and smaller reservations as comprising "a new spatial arrangement of apartheid."&lt;ref&gt;Nick Estes, ''Our History is the Future'' (London: Verso, 2019).&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Stephanie Woodard argues that the term "apartheid" is "an apt description of the relationship between the United States and its first peoples ... If a tribe wants to build a housing development or protect a sacred site, if a tribal member wants to start a business or plant a field, a federal agency can modify or scuttle the plans. Conversely, if a corporation or other outside interest covets reservation land or resources, the federal government becomes an obsequious bondservant, helping the non-Native entity get what it wants at bargain-basement prices."&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Woodard, ''American Apartheid: The Native American Struggle for Self-Determination and Inclusion'' (New York: Ig Publishing, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;
