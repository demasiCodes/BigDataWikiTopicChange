== Terminology ==
Sociologists Matthew Cole and Karen Morgan used the term ''vegaphobia'' and the derived adjective ''vegaphobic'' in a 2011 study, meaning prejudice against vegans specifically.&lt;ref name="cole" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Later authors used the term ''veganphobia'' (vegan-) in this sense.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Subsequent studies define vegaphobia as the dual aversion to vegans and vegetarians together.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="It ain't easy eating greens: Eviden" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; A 2019 study of vegaphobia in this sense adds ''vegaphobe'' for a person with vegaphobia.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Actor and producer Jola Cora also used the dual definition but calls it ''vegephobia'' (with an 'e'), in a 2013 conference talk titled "Vegephobia, what is it?"&lt;ref name="youtube1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tucw3cCzjLc|title=Vegephobia, what is it? Jola Cora at IARC 2013 Luxembourg|last=VeganKanal|date=12 September 2013|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attitudes in the general population ==
"In the media, in pop culture and even in progressive, enlightened polite society it is still widely acceptable to make fun of vegans", writes [[Farhad Manjoo]] in a 2019 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' opinion piece against mocking vegans.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Manjoo|first=Farhad|date=2019-08-28|title=Stop Mocking Vegans|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/opinion/vegan-food.html|access-date=2021-05-21|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manjoo cites findings from a 2015 study by Canadian psychologists, that the general population rates vegans more negatively than atheists and immigrants, and tolerates vegans only slightly better than drug addicts. Vegans get more negative ratings than vegetarians, and vegan men receive more negative ratings than women. Vegans are rated better if they're motivated by health reasons than if their veganism is driven by ethical or animal rights concerns.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=MacInnis|first1=Cara C.|last2=Hodson|first2=Gordon|date=2017-11-01|title=It ain't easy eating greens: Evidence of bias toward vegetarians and vegans from both source and target|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1368430215618253|journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|language=en|volume=20|issue=6|pages=721–744|doi=10.1177/1368430215618253|s2cid=147065882|issn=1368-4302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|date=2019-10-25|title=Why do people hate vegans?|url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/25/why-do-people-hate-vegans|access-date=2021-05-05|website=the Guardian|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=为何人们讨厌纯素食主义者？|url=https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_5410040|url-status=live|access-date=2021-07-15|website=[[The Paper (newspaper)|澎湃新闻 (The Paper)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Higgins|first=Abigail|date=2018-11-02|title=Why do people hate vegans so much?|url=https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/2/18055532/vegans-vegetarian-research-uk|access-date=2021-05-21|website=Vox|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among around a thousand Belgian [[Flemish people|Flemish]] meat eaters surveyed in 2016, vegaphobia against vegetarians was more common among men than among women, among older more than younger people, among people with a firmer intention to keep consuming meat, and among less educated people.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Vandermoere|first1=Frédéric|last2=Geerts|first2=Robbe|last3=De Backer|first3=Charlotte|last4=Erreygers|first4=Sara|last5=Van Doorslaer|first5=Els|date=2019-07-19|title=Meat Consumption and Vegaphobia: An Exploration of the Characteristics of Meat Eaters, Vegaphobes, and Their Social Environment|journal=Sustainability|language=en|volume=11|issue=14|pages=3936|doi=10.3390/su11143936|issn=2071-1050|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey of 300 US residents observed meat eaters' reactions to being reminded that meat comes from animals. The study showed that this increased discomfort while eating meat and also led to a less negative judgement of vegans.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Earle |first1=Megan |last2=Hodson |first2=Gordon |last3=Dhont |first3=Kristof |last4=MacInnis |first4=Cara |title=Eating with our eyes (closed): Effects of visually associating animals with meat on antivegan/vegetarian attitudes and meat consumption willingness |journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations |date=24 June 2019 |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=818–835 |doi=10.1177/1368430219861848 |s2cid=164266896 |url=https://kar.kent.ac.uk/73219/1/meat%20animal%20reminder%20manuscript%20revised%204.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These findings are consistent with vegans who feel discriminated by people who eat meat.&lt;ref name="It ain't easy eating greens: Eviden"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacInnis|first1=Cara C.|last2=Hodson|first2=Gordon|date=6 December 2015|title=It ain't easy eating greens: Evidence of bias toward vegetarians and vegans from both source and target|journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|volume=20|issue=6|pages=721–744|doi=10.1177/1368430215618253|s2cid=147065882}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, a survey of over 1,000 British and American vegans from the weight-loss application ''Lifesum'' found that 80% of respondents to have experienced some form of anti-vegan prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=There's a Term For Hating On Vegans And It's Vegaphobia|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/vbabp9/theres-a-term-for-hating-on-vegans-and-its-vegaphobia|url-status=live|access-date=2021-05-05|website=www.vice.com|language=en|quote=a new survey from Lifesum, a weight loss app, of UK and US-based vegans found that eight out of 10 respondents had experienced “vegaphobia” which it defined as a prejudice against vegans.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also meat-eaters who do not transition to a vegan diet because they fear being stigmatized when becoming a vegan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Markowski |first1=Kelly L. |last2=Roxburgh |first2=Susan |title='If I became a vegan, my family and friends would hate me:' Anticipating vegan stigma as a barrier to plant-based diets |journal=Appetite |date=April 2019 |volume=135 |pages=1–9 |doi=10.1016/j.appet.2018.12.040 |pmid=30605705 |s2cid=58643649 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attitudes of the media ==

Academic [[Laura Wright (academic)|Laura Wright]] stated in 2015 that media organizations and wider discourse routinely mischaracterize vegan diets, highlighting situations where media outlets reported the death of children as being from a "vegan diet" rather than the [[parental neglect]] that was the actual cause.&lt;ref name="Wright2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Wright|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwPaCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89|title=The Vegan Studies Project: Food, Animals, and Gender in the Age of Terror|date=1 October 2015|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-4854-4|pages=89–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a media analysis found that veganism and vegans are discredited in British media through ridicule, or as being difficult or impossible to maintain in practice.&lt;ref name="cole" /&gt; Negative items were (in order of frequency) ridiculing veganism, erroneously equating veganism with [[asceticism]], perpetuating the myth that veganism is difficult or impossible to sustain, describing veganism as a fashion trend, portraying vegans as [[sentimentalist]]s, and defining vegans as hostile.&lt;ref name="cole" /&gt; The study found that of 397 articles, 20% were neutral, approximately 5% were positive and 75% were negative.&lt;ref name="cole" /&gt; In 2018, a British food editor quit his job after a message from him showed him talking about "killing vegans one by one".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Why do people hate vegans so much? A UK food editor just lost his job for writing an email about “killing vegans.”, Link: https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/2/18055532/vegans-vegetarian-research-uk&lt;/ref&gt;

In social media, some vegans are also attacked for their choice to have only sexual relations to other vegans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Potts|first1=Annie|last2=Parry|first2=Jovian|date=15 February 2010|title=Vegan Sexuality: Challenging Heteronormative Masculinity through Meat-free Sex|journal=Feminism &amp; Psychology|volume=20|issue=1|pages=53–72|doi=10.1177/0959353509351181|s2cid=144430044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of vegaphobia ==
There are many theories to explain negative attitudes towards vegans.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Negative attitudes against vegans and vegetarians are most commonly found in people with conservative or [[right-wing]] beliefs,&lt;ref name="It ain't easy eating greens: Eviden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A dual-process motivational model o"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Judge |first1=Madeline |last2=Wilson |first2=Marc S. |title=A dual-process motivational model of attitudes towards vegetarians and vegans |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |date=February 2019 |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=169–178 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.2386 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meat Consumption and Vegaphobia: An"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vandermoere |first1=Frédéric |last2=Geerts |first2=Robbe |last3=De Backer |first3=Charlotte |last4=Erreygers |first4=Sara |last5=Van Doorslaer |first5=Els |title=Meat Consumption and Vegaphobia: An Exploration of the Characteristics of Meat Eaters, Vegaphobes, and Their Social Environment |journal=Sustainability |date=19 July 2019 |volume=11 |issue=14 |pages=3936 |doi=10.3390/su11143936 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; being often most pronounced in far-right groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Weill|first=Kelly|date=24 August 2018|title=Why Right Wingers Are Going Crazy About Meat|language=en|work=The Daily Beast|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-right-wingers-are-going-crazy-about-meat|access-date=28 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; For right-wing adherents, eating meat is not only a delight, but also a part of their attitude towards life. Thus, those who advocate against meat consumption can be perceived a threat to their way of life.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dhont |first1=Kristof |last2=Hodson |first2=Gordon |title=Why do right-wing adherents engage in more animal exploitation and meat consumption? |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=July 2014 |volume=64 |pages=12–17 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2014.02.002 |url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/5030419 |hdl=1854/LU-5030419 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of about 1,000 participants showed that vegans are perceived as a threat mainly by older and lower-educated people and convinced meat eaters.&lt;ref name="Meat Consumption and Vegaphobia: An" /&gt; A 2019 study found a positive correlation between world-views rooted in [[Power (social and political)|social dominance]] and a negative perception of vegans.&lt;ref name="A dual-process motivational model o" /&gt;

Explanations are founded on what is sometimes called the [[meat paradox]]: many people who eat meat do not like harming animals. Vegans can remind meat eaters of this [[cognitive dissonance]], and one way to resolve this inner conflict and reduce dissonance is to maintain prejudice against vegans.&lt;ref name="It ain't easy eating greens: Eviden"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bastian|first1=Brock|last2=Loughnan|first2=Steve|date=19 May 2016|title=Resolving the Meat-Paradox: A Motivational Account of Morally Troublesome Behavior and Its Maintenance|url=https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/25381242/Bastian_Loughnan_2016_PSPR_meat_paradox.pdf|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|volume=21|issue=3|pages=278–299|doi=10.1177/1088868316647562|pmid=27207840|s2cid=13360236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Gorvett|first=Zaria|title=The hidden biases that drive anti-vegan hatred|url=https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200203-the-hidden-biases-that-drive-anti-vegan-hatred|access-date=2021-05-21|website=www.bbc.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rothgerber |first1=Hank |title=Efforts to overcome vegetarian-induced dissonance among meat eaters |journal=Appetite |date=August 2014 |volume=79 |pages=32–41 |doi=10.1016/j.appet.2014.04.003 |pmid=24727102 |s2cid=12089867 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another proposed reason for negative attitudes against vegans is that meat eaters may feel judged by vegans and vegetarians for eating meat. Discrediting ethical vegans as [[do-gooder]]s is then a way to invalidate the judgement of oneself. These negative attitudes against vegans are higher when vegans are thought to think of themselves as morally superior.&lt;ref name="Do-Gooder Derogation"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Minson |first1=Julia A. |last2=Monin |first2=Benoît |title=Do-Gooder Derogation |journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science |date=18 July 2011 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=200–207 |doi=10.1177/1948550611415695 |s2cid=13891898 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title='Vegaphobia' Is the Dislike of Vegans|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/8xpgkv/these-are-some-of-the-reasons-vegans-have-such-a-bad-reputation|access-date=2021-05-05|website=www.vice.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there may be an inner conflict in meat eaters when it comes to the killing and eating of animals, this theory may not hold up to environmental reasons for not eating meat. Environmentalists may not see a conflict in eating meat because they see their individual environmental impact of meat consumption as low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scott |first1=Evon |last2=Kallis |first2=Giorgos |last3=Zografos |first3=Christos |last4=Olsson |first4=I Anna S |title=Why environmentalists eat meat |journal=PLOS ONE |date=11 July 2019 |volume=14 |issue=7 |pages=e0219607 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0219607 |pmid=31295301 |pmc=6622546 |bibcode=2019PLoSO..1419607S |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vegans are not always discredited for ideological reasons. Sometimes the reason may be that the person cannot share their food with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bresnahan |first1=Mary |last2=Zhuang |first2=Jie |last3=Zhu |first3=Xun |title=Why is the vegan line in the dining hall always the shortest?

== Vegaphobic acts ==
=== Against vegetarians ===
In the early 1990s, McDonald's started describing its French fries as vegetarian when they, in fact, contained beef-derived flavouring, leading to a ten million US dollar settlement in 2002 for misleading Hindus and other vegetarians into eating food against their conscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=McDonald's to pay $10M to vegetarians - Jun. 5, 2002|url=https://money.cnn.com/2002/06/05/news/companies/mcdonalds_a/index.htm|access-date=2021-05-09|website=money.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university reconsidered after support from the [[The Vegan Society|Vegan Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=2021-04-13|title=Bristol vegan student 'told to visit farm or fail course'|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-56734140|access-date=2021-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A primary school in [[Solihull]] forbade that a five-year old bring [[soya milk]] to school. It took three months and the help of the Vegan Society for the father of the child to change the school's mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hockaday|first=James|date=2021-06-24|title=Vegan dad couldn't sleep because daughter couldn't take soya milk to school|url=https://metro.co.uk/2021/06/24/vegan-dad-couldnt-sleep-because-daughter-couldnt-take-soya-milk-to-school-14821352/|access-date=2021-06-27|website=Metro|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When learning about a vegan person's diet, many nonvegans list all the animal-based foods that they like, without consideration for how this can make vegans feel uncomfortable ("I just love bacon")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenebaum|first=Jessica Beth|date=August 2017|title=Questioning the Concept of Vegan Privilege: A Commentary|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0160597616640308|journal=Humanity &amp; Society|language=en|volume=41|issue=3|pages=355–372|doi=10.1177/0160597616640308|issn=0160-5976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:363&lt;/sup&gt;.

Some vegans use the term ''veganphobia'' (with an 'n') when discussing prejudice and discrimination against vegans specifically.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Banned vegan TikToker complains 'veganphobia is real' – after comparing animal rights to coming out as LGBT+|url=https://uk.news.yahoo.com/banned-vegan-tiktoker-complains-veganphobia-131605296.html|access-date=2021-06-08|website=uk.news.yahoo.com|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Wrenn|first=Dr Corey|date=2016-11-08|title=A Month of Vegan Research: Veganphobia|url=http://www.coreyleewrenn.com/veganphobia/|access-date=2021-06-08|website=Corey Lee Wrenn, Ph.D.|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2018-11-01|title=Meat martyrs be warned: the vegans will inherit the Earth {{!}} Gaby Hinsliff|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/01/vegan-william-sitwell-waitrose-meat-plant|access-date=2021-06-08|website=the Guardian|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The application of the term "vegaphobia"—and the extent to which it can be compared to other forms of discrimination—is a somewhat divisive issue.&lt;ref name="vice"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt; Sophie Wilkinson of ''[[Grazia]]'' opined in 2018 that "discrimination is about being treated differently for who you are, not for what you choose to do."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilkinson|first=Sophie|date=December 3, 2018|title=No, Vegan-Based Discrimination Is Nonsense|publisher=[[Grazia]]|url=https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/food-and-drink/no-vegan-based-discrimination-is-nonsense/|access-date=July 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others would consider that an invalid criticism, distinguishing between two kinds of veganism, lifestyle and ethical.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Addis|first=Richard|title=UK court gives veganism status of a religion|url=https://theday.co.uk/stories/uk-court-gives-veganism-status-of-a-religion|access-date=2021-08-01|website=The Day}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkinson also wrote that discrimination against vegans (unlike [[sexism]], [[racism]], [[homophobia]], and the like) does not go beyond the level of [[microaggression]]s.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;
