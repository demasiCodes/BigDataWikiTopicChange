In 2007, a survey called "Vegaphobia: disproportionate talk about [[veganism]] in British national newspapers" took place in the United Kingdom, which examined 397 articles containing the terms "vegan", "vegans" and "veganism". The researchers found that 74.3% of the items are classified as "negatives"; 20.2% "neutral" and only 5.5% "positive". Negative items were in order of frequency: ridiculing veganism; characterize veganism as [[asceticism]]; affirming that veganism is difficult or impossible to sustain; describe veganism as a fashion; portray vegans as sentimentalists; defining vegans as hostile.&lt;ref name="cole" /&gt;

[[Laura Wright (academic)|Laura Wright]] claims that media organisations and wider discourse routinely mischaracterise vegan diets&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Vegan Studies Project : Food, Animals, and Gender in the Age of Terror|last=Wright|first=Laura|publisher=University of Georgia Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=EBSCOhost|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and highlights situations where media outlets report the death of children from a 'vegan diet' rather than the neglect that was the actual cause.&lt;ref name="Wright2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Wright|title=The Vegan Studies Project: Food, Animals, and Gender in the Age of Terror|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwPaCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89|date=1 October 2015|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-4854-4|pages=89–}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Christophe Traïni writes that some vegan activists may present themselves "as members of an oppressed minority rebelling against 'vegephobia{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cairn-int.info/article-E_RFSP_624_0559--between-disgust-and-moral-indignation.htm|title=Between disgust and moral indignation|first1=Christophe|last1=Traïni|first2=Katharine|last2=Throssell|date=|via=cairn-int.info|journal=Revue Française de Science Politique|volume=62|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the application of the term "vegaphobia"—and the extent to which it can be compared to other forms of discrimination—remains a divisive issue,&lt;ref name=vice/&gt; with Sophie Wilkinson of [[Grazia]] opining that "...discrimination is about being treated differently for who you are, not for what you choose to do." and that discrimination against vegans (unlike [[sexism]], [[racism]], [[homophobia]], etc.) doesn't tend to go beyond the level of [[microaggression]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/food-and-drink/no-vegan-based-discrimination-is-nonsense/|publisher=[[Grazia]]|title=No, Vegan-Based Discrimination Is Nonsense|first=Sophie|last=Wilkinson|date=December 3, 2018|access-date=July 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2013 International Animal Rights Conference, actress and producer Jola Cora, discussed the topic in a presentation called "Vegaphobia, what is it?"&lt;ref name="youtube1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tucw3cCzjLc|title=Vegephobia, what is it? Jola Cora at IARC 2013 Luxembourg|last=VeganKanal|date=12 September 2013|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, a survey of British and American vegans from the weight-loss application Lifesum found eight out of ten respondents to have experienced some form of anti-vegan prejudice.&lt;ref name=vice/&gt;
