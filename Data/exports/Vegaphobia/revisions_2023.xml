'''Vegaphobia''' or '''vegephobia''' is an aversion to, or dislike of, [[vegetarians]] and [[vegans]].&lt;ref name="cole"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vegaphobia: derogatory discourses of veganism and the reproduction of speciesism in UK national newspapers|first1=Matthew|last1=Cole|first2=Karen|last2=Morgan|date=1 March 2011|journal=The British Journal of Sociology|volume=62|issue=1|pages=134–153|doi=10.1111/j.1468-4446.2010.01348.x|pmid = 21361905|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z70tDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Vegaphobia&amp;pg=PA120|title=Understanding Veganism: Biography and Identity|last=Griffin|first=Nathan Stephens|date=2017-07-20|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319521022|pages=24, 47, 120|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term first appeared in the 2010s, coinciding with the [[Veganism#Into the mainstream|rise in veganism]] in the late 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Khara|first=Tani|date=November 7, 2018|title=Why do vegans have such bad reputations?|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-07/why-do-vegans-have-such-bad-reputations/10468652|access-date=July 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vice&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Vice Media]]|url=https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/vbabp9/theres-a-term-for-hating-on-vegans-and-its-vegaphobia|title=There's a Term For Hating On Vegans And It's Vegaphobia|access-date=July 20, 2019|date=November 26, 2018|first=Manisha|last=Krishnan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have found an incidence of vegaphobic sentiments in the general population.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Positive feelings regarding vegetarians and vegans also exist.

== Terminology ==
Three French [[Veggie Pride]] activists used the term {{Lang|fr|végéphobie}} meaning discrimination against vegetarians, in a 2011 document.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.veggiepride.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Vegephobie_FR_lecture.pdf |title=La végéphobie. Rejet du végétarisme pour les animaux &amp; discrimination des personnes végétariennes |publisher=[[Veggie Pride]] |year=2013 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British sociologists Matthew Cole and Karen Morgan used the term ''vegaphobia'' and the derived adjective ''vegaphobic'' in a 2011 study, meaning prejudice against vegans specifically.&lt;ref name="cole" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Reynolds |first=George |date=2019-10-25 |title=Why do people hate vegans? |url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/25/why-do-people-hate-vegans |access-date=2021-05-05 |website=The Guardian |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later authors used the term ''veganphobia'' (vegan-) in this sense.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Subsequent studies defined vegaphobia as the dual aversion to vegans and vegetarians together.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="It ain't easy eating greens: Eviden" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; A 2019 study of vegaphobia in this sense added the term ''vegaphobe'' for a person with vegaphobia.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Previously, the Swiss-Polish actor and producer Jola Cora had also used the dual aversion concept but called it ''vegephobia'' (with an 'e'), in a 2013 conference talk titled "Vegephobia, what is it?"&lt;ref name="youtube1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tucw3cCzjLc|title=Vegephobia, what is it? Jola Cora at IARC 2013 Luxembourg|last=VeganKanal|date=12 September 2013|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attitudes in the general population ==
"In the media, in pop culture and even in progressive, enlightened polite society it is still widely acceptable to make fun of vegans", writes [[Farhad Manjoo]] in a 2019 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' opinion piece against mocking vegans.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Manjoo|first=Farhad|date=2019-08-28|title=Stop Mocking Vegans|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/opinion/vegan-food.html|access-date=2021-05-21|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manjoo cites findings from a 2015 study by Canadian psychologists, that the general population rates vegans more negatively than atheists and immigrants, and tolerates vegans only slightly better than drug addicts. Vegans get more negative ratings than vegetarians, and vegan men receive more negative ratings than women. Vegans are rated better if they are motivated by health reasons than if their veganism is driven by ethical or animal rights concerns.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=MacInnis|first1=Cara C.|last2=Hodson|first2=Gordon|date=2017-11-01|title=It ain't easy eating greens: Evidence of bias toward vegetarians and vegans from both source and target|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1368430215618253|journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|language=en|volume=20|issue=6|pages=721–744|doi=10.1177/1368430215618253|s2cid=147065882|issn=1368-4302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=为何人们讨厌纯素食主义者？|url=https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_5410040|access-date=2021-07-15|website=[[The Paper (newspaper)|澎湃新闻 (The Paper)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among around a thousand Belgian [[Flemish people|Flemish]] meat eaters surveyed in 2016, vegaphobia against vegetarians was more common among men than among women, among older more than younger people, among people with a firmer intention to keep consuming meat, and among less educated people.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Vandermoere|first1=Frédéric|last2=Geerts|first2=Robbe|last3=De Backer|first3=Charlotte|last4=Erreygers|first4=Sara|last5=Van Doorslaer|first5=Els|date=2019-07-19|title=Meat Consumption and Vegaphobia: An Exploration of the Characteristics of Meat Eaters, Vegaphobes, and Their Social Environment|journal=Sustainability|language=en|volume=11|issue=14|pages=3936|doi=10.3390/su11143936|issn=2071-1050|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These findings are consistent with vegans who feel discriminated against by people that eat meat.&lt;ref name="It ain't easy eating greens: Eviden"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacInnis|first1=Cara C.|last2=Hodson|first2=Gordon|date=6 December 2015|title=It ain't easy eating greens: Evidence of bias toward vegetarians and vegans from both source and target|journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|volume=20|issue=6|pages=721–744|doi=10.1177/1368430215618253|s2cid=147065882}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, a survey of over 1,000 British and American vegans from the weight-loss application ''Lifesum'' found 80% of respondents to have experienced some form of anti-vegan prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=There's a Term For Hating On Vegans And It's Vegaphobia|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/vbabp9/theres-a-term-for-hating-on-vegans-and-its-vegaphobia|access-date=2021-05-05|website=www.vice.com|date=21 November 2018 |language=en|quote=a new survey from Lifesum, a weight loss app, of UK and US-based vegans found that eight out of 10 respondents had experienced “vegaphobia” which it defined as a prejudice against vegans.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fear of being stigmatized when becoming a vegan also keeps some meat-eaters from transitioning to a vegan diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Markowski |first1=Kelly L. |last2=Roxburgh |first2=Susan |title='If I became a vegan, my family and friends would hate me:' Anticipating vegan stigma as a barrier to plant-based diets |journal=Appetite |date=April 2019 |volume=135 |pages=1–9 |doi=10.1016/j.appet.2018.12.040 |pmid=30605705 |s2cid=58643649 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meat eaters rate vegans less negatively when they have been reminded that meat comes from animals, a survey of 300 US residents found. The reminder also increased their discomfort while eating meat.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Earle |first1=Megan |last2=Hodson |first2=Gordon |last3=Dhont |first3=Kristof |last4=MacInnis |first4=Cara |title=Eating with our eyes (closed): Effects of visually associating animals with meat on antivegan/vegetarian attitudes and meat consumption willingness |journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations |date=24 June 2019 |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=818–835 |doi=10.1177/1368430219861848 |s2cid=164266896 |url=https://kar.kent.ac.uk/73219/1/meat%20animal%20reminder%20manuscript%20revised%204.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attitudes of the media ==

Academic [[Laura Wright (academic)|Laura Wright]] stated in 2015 that media organizations and wider discourse routinely mischaracterize vegan diets, highlighting situations where media outlets reported the death of children as being from a "vegan diet" rather than the [[parental neglect]] that was the actual cause.&lt;ref name="Wright2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Wright|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwPaCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89|title=The Vegan Studies Project: Food, Animals, and Gender in the Age of Terror|date=1 October 2015|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-4854-4|pages=89–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study found that British media discredit vegans through ridicule, and portray veganism as difficult or impossible to maintain.&lt;ref name="cole" /&gt; The six most common vegaphobic statements found in these media were, in order of frequency: ridiculing veganism, erroneously equating veganism with [[asceticism]], perpetuating the myth that veganism is difficult or impossible to sustain, describing veganism as a fashion trend, portraying vegans as [[sentimentalist]]s, and defining vegans as hostile.&lt;ref name="cole" /&gt; The study found that of 397 articles, 20% were neutral, approximately 5% were positive and 75% were negative.&lt;ref name="cole" /&gt; In 2018, it was revealed that a British food editor had sent a vegan an email that mentioned "killing vegans one by one".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Higgins |first=Abigail |date=2018-11-02 |title=Why do people hate vegans so much? |url=https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/2/18055532/vegans-vegetarian-research-uk |access-date=2021-05-21 |website=Vox |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On social media, some vegans have also been attacked for their choice to have sexual relations only with other vegans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Potts|first1=Annie|last2=Parry|first2=Jovian|date=15 February 2010|title=Vegan Sexuality: Challenging Heteronormative Masculinity through Meat-free Sex|journal=Feminism &amp; Psychology|volume=20|issue=1|pages=53–72|doi=10.1177/0959353509351181|s2cid=144430044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of vegaphobia ==
There are many theories to explain negative attitudes towards vegans.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Negative attitudes against vegans and vegetarians are most commonly found in people with [[Conservatism|conservative]] and/or [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] beliefs, especially the ones associated with Abrahamic religions,&lt;ref name="It ain't easy eating greens: Eviden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A dual-process motivational model o"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Judge |first1=Madeline |last2=Wilson |first2=Marc S. |title=A dual-process motivational model of attitudes towards vegetarians and vegans |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |date=February 2019 |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=169–178 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.2386 |doi-access=free |hdl=11343/214063 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meat Consumption and Vegaphobia: An"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vandermoere |first1=Frédéric |last2=Geerts |first2=Robbe |last3=De Backer |first3=Charlotte |last4=Erreygers |first4=Sara |last5=Van Doorslaer |first5=Els |title=Meat Consumption and Vegaphobia: An Exploration of the Characteristics of Meat Eaters, Vegaphobes, and Their Social Environment |journal=Sustainability |date=19 July 2019 |volume=11 |issue=14 |pages=3936 |doi=10.3390/su11143936 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; being often most pronounced in [[Far-right politics|far-right individuals and groups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Weill|first=Kelly|date=24 August 2018|title=Why Right Wingers Are Going Crazy About Meat|language=en|work=The Daily Beast|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-right-wingers-are-going-crazy-about-meat|access-date=28 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some right-wing adherents, eating meat is not only a delight, but also a part of their attitudes towards life. Thus, they can perceive those who advocate against meat consumption as a threat to their way of life.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dhont |first1=Kristof |last2=Hodson |first2=Gordon |title=Why do right-wing adherents engage in more animal exploitation and meat consumption? |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=July 2014 |volume=64 |pages=12–17 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2014.02.002 |url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/5030419 |hdl=1854/LU-5030419 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of about 1,000 participants showed that vegans are perceived as a threat mainly by older and less educated people, and by meat eaters who are particularly convinced of their habit.&lt;ref name="Meat Consumption and Vegaphobia: An" /&gt; A 2019 study found a positive correlation between world-views rooted in [[Power (social and political)|social dominance]] ("social dominance orientation") and a negative perception of vegans.&lt;ref name="A dual-process motivational model o" /&gt;

One explanation for vegaphobia is founded on what is sometimes called the [[meat paradox]]: many people who eat meat do not like harming animals. Vegans can remind meat eaters of this [[cognitive dissonance]], and one way to resolve this inner conflict and reduce dissonance is to maintain prejudice against vegans.&lt;ref name="It ain't easy eating greens: Eviden"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bastian|first1=Brock|last2=Loughnan|first2=Steve|date=19 May 2016|title=Resolving the Meat-Paradox: A Motivational Account of Morally Troublesome Behavior and Its Maintenance|url=https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/25381242/Bastian_Loughnan_2016_PSPR_meat_paradox.pdf|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|volume=21|issue=3|pages=278–299|doi=10.1177/1088868316647562|pmid=27207840|s2cid=13360236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Gorvett|first=Zaria|title=The hidden biases that drive anti-vegan hatred|url=https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200203-the-hidden-biases-that-drive-anti-vegan-hatred|access-date=2021-05-21|website=www.bbc.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rothgerber |first1=Hank |title=Efforts to overcome vegetarian-induced dissonance among meat eaters |journal=Appetite |date=August 2014 |volume=79 |pages=32–41 |doi=10.1016/j.appet.2014.04.003 |pmid=24727102 |s2cid=12089867 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another proposed reason for vegaphobia is that meat eaters may feel judged by vegans and vegetarians for eating meat. [[Do-gooder derogation|Discrediting]] [[ethical vegan]]s as do-gooders is then a way to invalidate the judgement of oneself. These negative attitudes against vegans are stronger when vegans are thought to think of themselves as morally superior.&lt;ref name="Do-Gooder Derogation"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Minson |first1=Julia A. |last2=Monin |first2=Benoît |title=Do-Gooder Derogation |journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science |date=18 July 2011 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=200–207 |doi=10.1177/1948550611415695 |s2cid=13891898 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title='Vegaphobia' Is the Dislike of Vegans|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/8xpgkv/these-are-some-of-the-reasons-vegans-have-such-a-bad-reputation|access-date=2021-05-05|website=Vice|first=Tani|last=Khara|date=2018-11-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While meat eaters may have an inner conflict about the killing of animals for their food, this explanation of vegaphobia may not hold up to environmental reasons for avoiding meat. Environmentalist meat eaters may not see a conflict in eating meat because they see their individual environmental impact of meat consumption as low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scott |first1=Evon |last2=Kallis |first2=Giorgos |last3=Zografos |first3=Christos |last4=Olsson |first4=I Anna S |title=Why environmentalists eat meat |journal=PLOS ONE |date=11 July 2019 |volume=14 |issue=7 |pages=e0219607 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0219607 |pmid=31295301 |pmc=6622546 |bibcode=2019PLoSO..1419607S |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vegans may not always be discredited for ideological reasons. Sometimes the reason may be that the vegaphobe cannot share food with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bresnahan |first1=Mary |last2=Zhuang |first2=Jie |last3=Zhu |first3=Xun |title=Why is the vegan line in the dining hall always the shortest?

== Vegaphobic acts ==
=== Against vegetarians ===
In the early 1990s, McDonald's started describing its French fries as vegetarian when they, in fact, contained beef-derived flavouring, leading to a ten million US dollar settlement in 2002 for misleading Hindus and other vegetarians into eating food against their conscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=McDonald's to pay $10M to vegetarians - Jun. 5, 2002|url=https://money.cnn.com/2002/06/05/news/companies/mcdonalds_a/index.htm|access-date=2021-05-09|website=money.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2020, a parliamentary employee of the nationalist [[Alternative for Germany]] called someone who ordered vegetarian food in the canteen of the German parliament a pejorative term, saying "we are going to get you".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Fiedler|first=Maria|date=2020-11-20|title=Debatte im Bundestag wird zur Generalabrechnung mit der AfD|language=de-DE|work=[[Der Tagesspiegel]]|url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/tiefpunkt-einer-dauerhaften-strategie-debatte-im-bundestag-wird-zur-generalabrechnung-mit-der-afd/26643632.html|access-date=2021-10-30|issn=1865-2263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Oscar Horta]] links vegaphobia to discrimination against vegans, which he observes, among other instances, at the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horta|first=Oscar|date=2018-10-08|title=Discrimination Against Vegans|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11158-017-9356-3|journal=Res Publica|language=en|volume=24|issue=3|pages=360|doi=10.1007/s11158-017-9356-3|s2cid=149303895|issn=1356-4765|quote=The fact that vegans are often considered worse than nonvegans epistemically, morally, and in general due to vegaphobia, explains some cases where they are intentionally treated worse, and also why vegans are in many cases pressed by others to quit veganism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A vegan was denied a Swiss passport by local voters,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Roberts|first=Elizabeth|date=2017-01-12|title=Vegan denied Swiss citizenship for her 'loud' views on animal rights|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/12/health/switzerland-citizenship-vegan-trnd/index.html|access-date=2021-05-09|website=[[CNN]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and people have thrown [[KFC]] chicken at vegans in England,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Parker|first=Hayley|date=2020-09-17|title=Drivers lob chicken legs at vegan activists protesting outside Wayne Walker's|url=https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/passing-motorists-lob-kfc-chicken-4519001|access-date=2021-05-09|website=StokeonTrentLive|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in both cases as a reaction to their lawful animal rights protest. In 2018, [[William Sitwell]], then editor of the [[Waitrose#Waitrose Kitchen magazine|''Waitrose Food'']] magazine, responded to a request for a vegan column by proposing "a series on killing vegans, one by one".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2018-10-31|title=Waitrose magazine editor quits after joke about killing vegans|url=http://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/31/waitrose-magazine-editor-william-sitwell-steps-down-over-email-mocking-vegans|access-date=2021-05-09|website=The Guardian|first=Jim|last=Waterson|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A vegan college student from [[Bristol]] was told to watch bull castration and visit an [[Slaughterhouse|abattoir]] or fail her course in animal management. The university reconsidered after support from the [[The Vegan Society|Vegan Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=2021-04-13|title=Bristol vegan student 'told to visit farm or fail course'|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-56734140|access-date=2021-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A primary school in [[Solihull]] forbade a five-year-old from bringing [[soya milk]] to school. It took three months and the help of the Vegan Society for the father of the child to change the school's mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hockaday|first=James|date=2021-06-24|title=Vegan dad couldn't sleep because daughter couldn't take soya milk to school|url=https://metro.co.uk/2021/06/24/vegan-dad-couldnt-sleep-because-daughter-couldnt-take-soya-milk-to-school-14821352/|access-date=2021-06-27|website=Metro|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When learning about a vegan person's diet, many nonvegans list all the animal-based foods that they like, without consideration for how this can make vegans feel uncomfortable ("I just love bacon").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenebaum|first=Jessica Beth|date=August 2017|title=Questioning the Concept of Vegan Privilege: A Commentary|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0160597616640308|journal=Humanity &amp; Society|language=en|volume=41|issue=3|pages=355–372|doi=10.1177/0160597616640308|s2cid=148375150 |issn=0160-5976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:363&lt;/sup&gt;

Some vegans use the term ''veganphobia'' (with an 'n') when discussing prejudice and discrimination against vegans specifically.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Banned vegan TikToker complains 'veganphobia is real' – after comparing animal rights to coming out as LGBT+|url=https://uk.news.yahoo.com/banned-vegan-tiktoker-complains-veganphobia-131605296.html|access-date=2021-06-08|website=uk.news.yahoo.com|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Wrenn|first=Corey|date=2016-11-08|title=A Month of Vegan Research: Veganphobia|url=http://www.coreyleewrenn.com/veganphobia/|access-date=2021-06-08|website=Corey Lee Wrenn, Ph.D.|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2018-11-01|title=Meat martyrs be warned: the vegans will inherit the Earth {{!}} Gaby Hinsliff|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/01/vegan-william-sitwell-waitrose-meat-plant|access-date=2021-06-08|website=the Guardian|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{Lang|es|Unión Vegana Argentina}} in 2019 petitioned the Argentine government agency [[National Institute Against Discrimination, Xenophobia and Racism]] to include vegaphobia in its discrimination mappings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=UVA |date=2013-10-25 |title=Petición al INADI |url=http://www.unionvegana.org/peticion-al-inadi/ |access-date=2022-08-20 |website=UVA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Bouzón |first=Sofia |date=2021-12-14 |title=Veganismo y discriminación en Argentina |url=https://latfem.org/que-es-la-vegefobia/ |access-date=2022-08-20 |website=LatFem |language=es-AR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=UVA |date=2019-11-30 |title=OBSERVATORIO NACIONAL DE LA VEGEFOBIA |url=http://www.unionvegana.org/observatorio-nacional-de-la-vegefobia/ |access-date=2022-08-20 |website=UVA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The application of the term "vegaphobia"—and the extent to which it can be compared to other forms of discrimination—is a somewhat divisive issue.&lt;ref name="vice"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Addis |first=Richard |title=UK court gives veganism status of a religion |url=https://theday.co.uk/stories/uk-court-gives-veganism-status-of-a-religion |access-date=2021-08-01 |website=The Day|date=7 January 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2013-05-16 |title=Végéphobie, bisouphobie : l'explosion des phobes |url=https://www.contrepoints.org/2013/05/16/124574-vegephobie-bisouphobie-lexplosion-des-phobes |access-date=2022-03-12 |website=Contrepoints |language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sophie Wilkinson of ''[[Grazia]]'' opined in 2018 that discrimination against vegans (unlike [[sexism]], [[racism]], and [[homophobia]]) does not go beyond the level of [[microaggression]]s.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; She also wrote that "discrimination is about being treated differently for who you are, not for what you choose to do", implying that being a vegan is not ''who you are'', but rather ''what you choose to do''.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilkinson|first=Sophie|date=December 3, 2018|title=No, Vegan-Based Discrimination Is Nonsense|publisher=[[Grazia]]|url=https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/food-and-drink/no-vegan-based-discrimination-is-nonsense/|access-date=July 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have distinguished between two kinds of veganism, lifestyle and ethical.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Veganism motivated by ethical beliefs about animals was ruled to be a protected belief in the [[United Kingdom]] under the [[Equality Act 2010|Equality Act]] in an unfair dismissal lawsuit in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2020-01-03 |title=Ethical veganism is a belief protected by law, tribunal rules |url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/03/ethical-veganism-is-a-belief-protected-by-law-tribunal-rules |access-date=2022-04-22 |website=The Guardian|first=Damien|last=Gayle |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2020-01-03 |title=After tribunal's ethical veganism ruling, what is a protected belief? |url=http://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/jan/03/after-tribunals-ruling-on-ethical-veganism-what-is-a-protected-belief |access-date=2022-04-22 |website=The Guardian|first=Damien|last=Gayle |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
