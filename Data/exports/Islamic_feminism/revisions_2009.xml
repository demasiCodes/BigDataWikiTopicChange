{{Feminism sidebar |expanded=Subtypes}}
'''[[Islam|Islamic]] [[feminism]]''' is a form of feminism concerned with the role of [[Women and Islam|women in Islam]].  It aims for the full equality of all [[Muslims]], regardless of gender, in public and private life. Islamic feminists advocate [[women's rights]], [[gender equality]], and [[social justice]] grounded in an Islamic framework.  Although rooted in [[Islam]], the movement's pioneers have also utilised [[Secularity|secular]] and European or non-Muslim feminist discourses and recognize the role of Islamic feminism as part of an integrated global feminist movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feminismeislamic.org/eng/index.htm International Congress on Islamic Feminism]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Advocates of the movement seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the [[Quran]] and encourage a questioning of the [[patriarchal]] interpretation of [[Islamic]] teaching through the Quran (holy book), ''[[hadith]]'' (sayings of [[Muhammad]]) and ''[[sharia]]'' (law) towards the creation of a more equal and just society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/569/cu1.htm Al-Ahram Weekly | Culture | Islamic feminism: what's in a name?&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Muslim majority countries]] have produced more than seven female [[head of state]]s including [[Benazir Bhutto]] of [[Pakistan]], [[Mame Madior Boye]] of [[Senegal]], [[Tansu Çiller]] of [[Turkey]], [[Kaqusha Jashari]] of [[Kosovo]], [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]] of [[Indonesia]] and [[Bangladesh]], the first country in the [[world]] to have one female head-of-state follow another, those two being [[Khaleda Zia]] and [[Sheikh Hasina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women Who Rule: 10 Firsts - MSN Encarta &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt;|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/Features/Columns/?article=WomenWhoRule|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257023758600338|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and rise of Islamic feminism==
===Early reforms under Islam===
{{see also|Early reforms under Islam|Islamic ethics|Sharia}}

During the [[early reforms under Islam]] in the 7th century, reforms in [[women's rights]] affected [[marriage]], [[divorce]] and [[inheritance]].&lt;ref name="Espos"&gt;Esposito (2005) p. 79 &lt;/ref&gt; Women were not accorded with such legal status in other cultures, including the West, until centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Lindsay. p.6224&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Oxford Dictionary of Islam'' states that the general improvement of the status of Arab women included prohibition of [[female infanticide]] and recognizing women's full personhood.&lt;ref name="OxfordDicT"&gt;Esposito (2004), p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; "The [[dowry]], previously regarded as a bride-price paid to the father, became a nuptial gift retained by the wife as part of her personal property."&lt;ref name="majid"&gt;Khadduri (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Espos"/&gt; Under Islamic law, marriage was no longer viewed as a "status" but rather as a "[[contract]]", in which the woman's consent was imperative.&lt;ref name="majid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Espos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OxfordDicT"/&gt; "Women were given inheritance rights in a [[patriarchal society]] that had previously restricted inheritance to male relatives."&lt;ref name="Espos"/&gt; 

[[Annemarie Schimmel]] states that "compared to the pre-Islamic position of women, Islamic legislation meant an enormous progress; the woman has the right, at least according to the letter of the law, to administer the wealth she has brought into the family or has earned by her own work."&lt;ref name = "Schimmel"&gt;Schimmel (1992) p.65&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Montgomery Watt]] states that Muhammad, in the historical context of his time, can be seen as a figure who testified on behalf of [[women’s rights]] and improved things considerably. Watt explains: "At the time Islam began, the conditions of women were terrible - they had no [[Property|right to own property]], were supposed to be the property of the man, and if the man died everything went to his sons." Muhammad, however, by "instituting rights of property ownership, inheritance, education and divorce, gave women certain basic safeguards."&lt;ref&gt; Maan, McIntosh (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Haddad and [[John Esposito|Esposito]] state that "Muhammad granted women rights and privileges in the sphere of [[Family|family life]], marriage, education, and economic endeavors, rights that help improve women's status in society."&lt;ref&gt;Haddad, Esposito (1998) p.163 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval period===
{{see also|Women in Islam|Women in Iraq}}

Whilst in the pre-modern period there was not a formal feminist movement, nevertheless there were a number of important figures who argued for improving women's rights and autonomy. These range from the medieval mystic and philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]], who argued that women could achieve spiritual stations as equally high as men &lt;ref name=Hakim-2002&gt;{{citation|title=Ibn 'Arabî's Twofold Perception of Woman: Woman as Human Being and Cosmic Principle|first=Souad|last=Hakim|journal=Journal of the Muhyiddin Ibn 'Arabi Society|volume=31|date=2002|pages=1–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Nana Asma’u]], daughter of eighteenth-century reformer [[Usman Dan Fodio]], who pushed for literacy and education of Muslim women.&lt;ref name=Mack-2000&gt;{{citation|title=One Woman's Jihad: Nana Asma'u, Scholar and Scribe|first=Beverly B.|last=Mack|coauthors=Jean Boyd|location=USA|publisher=Indiana University Press|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women played an important role in the foundations of many [[Madrasah|Islamic educational institutions]], such as [[Fatima al-Fihri]]'s founding of the [[University of Al Karaouine]] in 859. This continued through to the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] in the 12th and 13th centuries, when 160 [[mosque]]s and [[madrasah]]s were established in [[Damascus]], 26 of which were funded by women through the [[Waqf]] ([[charitable trust]] or [[trust law]]) system. Half of all the royal [[Patronage|patrons]] for these institutions were also women.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World|first=James E.|last=Lindsay|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2005|isbn=0313322708|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Sunni]] scholar [[Ibn Asakir]] in the 12th century, there were opportunities for [[female education]] in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], writing that women could study, earn ''[[ijazah]]s'' ([[academic degree]]s), and qualify as [[Ulema|scholars]] and [[teacher]]s. This was especially the case for learned and scholarly families, who wanted to ensure the highest possible education for both their sons and daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World|first=James E.|last=Lindsay|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2005|isbn=0313322708|pages=196 &amp; 198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Asakir had himself studied under 80 different female teachers in his time. Female education in the Islamic world was inspired by [[Muhammad's wives]]: [[Khadijah]], a successful businesswoman, and [[Aisha]], a renowned [[Muhaddith|hadith scholar]] and [[Battle of Bassorah|military leader]]. According to a [[hadith]] attributed to [[Muhammad]], he praised the women of [[Medina]] because of their desire for religious knowledge:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World|first=James E.|last=Lindsay|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2005|isbn=0313322708|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"How splendid were the women of the ''[[Ansar (Islam)|ansar]]''; shame did not prevent them from becoming learned in the faith."}}

While it was not common for women to enroll as students in formal [[Class (education)|classes]], it was common for women to attend informal [[lecture]]s and study sessions at mosques, madrasahs and other public places. While there were no legal restrictions on female education, some men did not approve of this practice, such as Muhammad ibn al-Hajj (d. 1336) who was appalled at the behaviour of some women who informally [[audit]]ed lectures in his time:&lt;ref name=Lindsay&gt;{{citation|title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World|first=James E.|last=Lindsay|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2005|isbn=0313322708|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"[Consider] what some women do when people gather with a [[Sheikh|shaykh]] to hear [the recitation of] books. At that point women come, too, to hear the readings; the men sit in one place, the women facing them. It even happens at such times that some of the women are carried away by the situation; one will stand up, and sit down, and shout in a loud voice. [Moreover,] her ''[[Awrah|'awra]]'' will appear; in her house, their exposure would be forbidden — how can it be allowed in a mosque, in the presence of men?"}}

On the question of women in medieval Islam, Abdul Hakim Murad writes
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the orientalist Ignaz Goldziher showed that perhaps fifteen percent of medieval hadith scholars were women, teaching in the mosques and universally admired for their integrity. Colleges such as the Saqlatuniya Madrasa in Cairo were funded and staffed entirely by women. The most recent study of Muslim female academicians, by Ruth Roded, charts an extraordinary dilemma for the researcher:

‘If U.S. and European historians feel a need to reconstruct women’s history because women are invisible in the traditional sources, Islamic scholars are faced with a plethora of source material that has only begun to be studied. [ . . . ] In reading the biographies of thousands of Muslim women scholars, one is amazed at the evidence that contradicts the view of Muslim women as marginal, secluded, and restricted.’

Stereotypes come under almost intolerable strain when Roded documents the fact that the proportion of female lecturers in many classical Islamic colleges was higher than in modern Western universities.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.masud.co.uk/ISLAM/ahm/gender.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th century, [[Al-Sakhawi]] devotes an entire volume of his 12-volume [[biographical dictionary]] ''Daw al-lami'' to female scholars, giving information on 1,075 of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Women in Iran from the Rise of Islam to 1800|last=Guity Nashat|first=Lois Beck|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|year=2003|isbn=0252071212|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[labor force]] in the [[Caliphate]] were [[employed]] from diverse [[ethnic]] and [[religious]] backgrounds, while both men and women were involved in diverse [[List of occupations|occupations]] and [[Islamic economics in the world|economic activities]].&lt;ref&gt;Maya Shatzmiller, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Women were employed in a wide range of commercial activities and diverse occupations&lt;ref name=Maya-400-1&gt;Maya Shatzmiller (1994), ''Labour in the Medieval Islamic World'', [[Brill Publishers]], ISBN 9004098968, pp. 400–1&lt;/ref&gt; in the primary sector (as [[farmer]]s for example), secondary sector (as [[construction worker]]s, [[dye]]rs, [[Spinning (textiles)|spinners]], etc.) and tertiary sector (as [[investor]]s, [[Physician|doctors]], [[nurse]]s, [[president]]s of [[guild]]s, [[broker]]s, [[peddler]]s, [[lender]]s, [[scholar]]s, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Maya Shatzmiller, pp. 350–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim women also held a [[monopoly]] over certain branches of the [[textile industry]],&lt;ref name=Maya-400-1/&gt; the largest and most specialized and market-oriented industry at the time, in occupations such as [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]], [[dying]], and [[embroidery]]. In comparison, [[Women's rights|female]] [[property rights]] and [[wage labour]] were relatively uncommon in [[Europe]] until the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Maya Shatzmiller (1997), "Women and Wage Labour in the Medieval Islamic West: Legal Issues in an Economic Context", ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient'' '''40''' (2), pp. 174–206 [175–7].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12th century, the famous [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]] and [[qadi]] (judge) [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd]], known to the West as ''Averroes'', claimed that women were equal to men in all respects and possessed equal capacities to shine [[Peace In Islamic Thought|in peace]] and [[Islamic military jurisprudence|in war]], citing examples of female warriors among the [[Arab]]s, [[Greeks]] and [[Africa]]ns to support his case.&lt;ref name=Ahmad&gt;{{citation|last=Ahmad|first=Jamil|year=1994|date=September 1994|title=Ibn Rushd|journal=[[Al-Mawrid|Monthly Renaissance]]|volume=4|issue=9|url=http://www.monthly-renaissance.com/issue/content.aspx?id=744|accessdate=2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early [[Muslim history]], examples of notable female Muslims who fought during the [[Muslim conquests]] and [[Fitna (word)|Fitna]] (civil wars) as soldiers or generals included [[Nusaybah Bint k’ab Al Maziniyyah]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realnews247.com/girl_power.htm Girl Power], ''[[ABC News]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aisha]],&lt;ref name="Baghdad"&gt;{{cite book|last=Black|first=Edwin|title=Banking on Baghdad: Inside Iraq's 7,000 Year History of War, Profit, and Conflict|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year= 2004|isbn=047170895X|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kahula]] and Wafeira&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Woman's Record: Or, Sketches of All Distinguished Women, from "The Beginning Till A.D. 1850, Arranged in Four Eras, with Selections from Female Writers of Every Age| author=Hale, Sarah Josepha Buell |publisher=Harper Brothers|year=1853|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In terms of [[women's rights]], women generally had fewer legal restrictions under [[Sharia|Islamic law]] than they did under certain Western legal systems until the 20th century. For example, under traditional interpretations of sharia, women had the right to keep their surnames upon marriage; inherit and bestow inheritance; independently manage their financial affairs; and contract marriages and divorce. In contrast, restrictions on the legal capacity of married women under [[French law]] were not removed until 1965.&lt;ref name=Badr-1984&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Criminal Justice|first=Gamal M.|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=32|issue=1|date=Winter 1984|pages=167–169 [167–8]|doi=10.2307/840274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noah Feldman, a law professor at [[Harvard University]], notes:

{{quote|As for [[sexism]], the [[common law]] long denied married women any property rights or indeed legal personality apart from their husbands. When the British applied their law to Muslims in place of Shariah, as they did in some colonies, the result was to strip married women of the property that Islamic law had always granted them — hardly progress toward equality of the sexes.&lt;ref name=Feldman&gt;{{cite web|author=Noah Feldman|title=Why Shariah?|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=March 16, 2008|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/magazine/16Shariah-t.html?ei=5070&amp;em=&amp;en=5c1b8de536ce606f&amp;ex=1205812800&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=2008-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In contrast to the [[Western world]] where [[divorce]] was relatively uncommon until modern times, and in contrast to the low rates of divorce in the modern [[Middle East]], divorce was a common occurrence in the pre-modern [[Muslim world]], where it was known as ''[[Talaq (Nikah)|talaq]]''. In the medieval Islamic world and the [[Ottoman Empire]], the rate of divorce was higher than it is today in the modern Middle East.&lt;ref name=Rapoport&gt;{{citation|title=Marriage, Money and Divorce in Medieval Islamic Society|first=Yossef|last=Rapoport|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=052184715X|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 15th century [[Egypt]], [[Al-Sakhawi]] recorded the marital history of 500 women, the largest [[Sampling (statistics)|sample]] on marriage in the [[Middle Ages]], and found that at least a third of all women in the [[Mamluk|Mamluk Sultanate]] of Egypt and [[Syria]] married more than once, with many marrying three or more times.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Marriage, Money and Divorce in Medieval Islamic Society|first=Yossef|last=Rapoport|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=052184715X|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nineteenth century===
{{Refimprovesect|date=October 2009}}
The modern movement of Islamic feminism began in the late nineteenth century. Egyptian jurist [[Qasim Amin]], the author of the 1899 pioneering book ''Women's Liberation'' (''Tahrir al-Mar'a''), is often described as the father of the Egyptian feminist movement. In his work, Amin criticized some of the practices prevalent in his society at the time, such as [[Polygyny in Islam|polygyny]], [[Islam and clothing|the veil]], and ''[[purdah]]'', i.e. [[sex segregation in Islam]]. He condemned them as un-Islamic and contradictory to the true spirit of Islam. His work had an enormous influence on women's political movements throughout the Islamic and [[Arab world]], and is read and cited today.

Despite Qasim Amin's effects on modern-day Islamic feminist movements, present-day scholar Leila Ahmed considers his works both [[androcentric]] and [[colonialist]].&lt;ref&gt;Leila Ahmed. Women and Gender in Islam. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1992. pp.155-163, 171, 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad 'Abdu, an Egyptian nationalist,&lt;ref&gt;Leila Ahmed. Women and Gender in Islam. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1992. pp.136-137.&lt;/ref&gt; could easily have written the chapters of his work that show honest considerations of the negative effects of the veil on women.&lt;ref&gt;Leila Ahmed. Women and Gender in Islam. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1992. pp.159,161.&lt;/ref&gt; Amin even posed many male-centered misconceptions about women, such as their inability to experience love, that women needlessly (when they had very good reason to) talk about their husbands outside their presence, and that Muslim marriage is based on ignorance and sensuality, of which women were the chief source.&lt;ref&gt;Leila Ahmed. Women and Gender in Islam. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1992. pp.157-159.&lt;/ref&gt;

Less known, however, are the women who preceded Amin in their feminist critique of their societies. The women's press in Egypt started voicing such concerns since its very first issues in 1892. Egyptian, Turkish, Iranian, Syrian and Lebanese women and men had been reading European feminist magazines even a decade earlier, and discussed their relevance to the [[Middle East]] in the general press.&lt;ref&gt;see "Great Ancestors: Women Asserting Rights in Muslim Contexts," by Farida Shaheed with Aisha L.F. Shaheed (London/Lahore: WLUML/Shirkat Gah, 2005) [http://www.wluml.org/english/pubsfulltxt.shtml?%5B87%5D=i-87-186208]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth century===
[[Aisha Abd al-Rahman]], writing under her pen name ''Bint al-Shati'' ("Daughter of the Riverbank"), was the first modern woman to undertake [[Qur'an]]ic [[exegesis]], and though she did not considered herself to be a [[Feminism|feminist]], her works reflect feminist themes. She began producing her popular books in 1959, the same year that [[Naguib Mahfouz]] published his allegorical and feminist version of the life of [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Ruth|last=Roded|title=Bint al-Shati’s Wives of the Prophet: Feminist or Feminine?|journal=British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies|date=May 2006|volume=33|issue=1|pages=51–66|doi=10.1080/13530190600603915}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote biographies of early [[women in Islam]], including the [[Aminah bint Wahb|mother]], [[Muhammad's wives|wives]] and [[Family tree of Muhammad|daughters]] of the [[Prophets of Islam|Prophet]] Muhammad, as well as [[literary criticism]].&lt;ref name="zeidan"&gt;Arab Women Novelists: The Formative Years and Beyond by Joseph T. Zeidan, State University of New York Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definitions===
Islamic feminism is defined by [[Islamic scholars]] as being more radical than secular [[feminism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/569/cu1.htm "Islamic feminism: what's in a name?"] by Margot Badran, ''Al-Ahram'', January 17–23, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and as being anchored within the [[discourse]] of Islam with the [[Qur'an]] as its central text.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?topic_id=1426&amp;fuseaction=topics.event_summary&amp;event_id=42775 "Exploring Islamic Feminism"] by Margot Badran, Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding, Georgetown University, November 30, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent times the concept of Islamic feminism has grown further, with Islamic groups looking to garner support from as many aspects of society as possible, and educated Muslim women striving to articulate their role in society.&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, R. Stephen: "Between Memory and Desire - The Middle East in a Troubled Age", ''University of California Press'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The history and potential success of such a movement is debatable but looking back through the Qur'an there has always been a degree of respect afforded to women with the Qur'an stressing the importance of men, but also women's rights to honorable treatment. However, such freedoms as property rights and the respect from men are often sidelined, with little recourse being available for those that wish to protest. It has been, however, mainly upper-middle-class women that have been able to vocalise the Islamic feminist movement, as they have the economic security to violate widely held beliefs.

===Muslim feminism===
Another side to modern Islamic feminism is the activism of Muslim women born and brought up within Western societies. Often those born to immigrant families face [[racism]] from the host community  and [[sexism]] within their own communities.  Young Muslim women in France fought back against the issues facing them, ranging from endemic [[sexual violence]] to the forced wearing of the [[hijab]], by creating [[Ni Putes Ni Soumises]] (usually translated "Neither Whores Nor Submissives").  This movement has spread to other countries.

===Borrowings from secular feminism===
The rise of feminism in the [[Islamic world]] has also been linked to the rise of western influence, with a political and economic attempt to align with western powers and markets promoting Western ideas such as [[universal suffrage]], [[human rights]] and access to education.

==Muslim Personal Law and Islamic feminism==
{{Citations missing|date=July 2007}}
{{see also|Sharia}}
One of the major areas of scholarship and campaigning for Islamic feminists in various parts of the world is Muslim Personal Law (also known as Muslim Family Law). MPL includes three main areas of law: marriage, divorce, and inheritance.

Muslim majority countries that have promulgated some form of MPL include [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Libya]], [[Sudan]], [[Senegal]], [[Tunisia]], [[Egypt]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Bangladesh]]. Muslim minority countries that already have operating MPL regimes or are considering passing legislation on aspects of MPL include [[India]] and [[South Africa]].

In general, Islamic feminists have objected to the MPL legislation in many of these countries, arguing that these pieces of legislation discriminate against women. Some Islamic feminists have taken the attitude that a reformed MPL which is based on the [[Qur'an]] and [[Sunnah]], which includes substantial input from Muslim women and which does not discriminate against women is possible. Such Islamic feminists have been working on developing such women-friendly forms of MPL. (See, for example, [http://www.ccmw.com/GTAForum/index.htm Canadian Council of Muslim Women] for argument based on the Quran and not on what they call medieval male consensus.)  Other Islamic feminists, particularly some in Muslim minority contexts which are democratic states, argue that MPL should not be reformed but should be rejected and that Muslim women should seek redress, instead, from the civil laws of those states. &lt;!--this paragraph needs to cite sources and name the women or groups, instead of "some Islamic feminists."--&gt;

For most Islamic feminists, some of the thorny issues regarding the way in which MPL has thus far been formulated include: [[polygyny]], divorce, custody of children, maintenance and marital property. In addition, there are also more macro issues regarding the underlying assumptions of such legislation, for example, the assumption of the man as head of the household.

==Sexuality==  	
{{see also|Islamic sexual jurisprudence|Homosexuality and Islam}} 	
 		
Despite the taboo status of sex and [[human sexuality|sexuality]] in many Muslim societies, some [[ulema|Quranic scholars]] have argued that the Quran itself discusses these subjects openly and positively, and that Islam is one of the most sexually accepting of the major world religions.&lt;ref name="safra"&gt;[http://www.safraproject.org/sgi-womenssexualtiyinislam.htm SAFRA Project Essay on Islam and Sexuality]&lt;/ref&gt; .&lt;ref&gt;See the works of Asra Nomani for more details&lt;/ref&gt;	
 		
There is debate over the interpretations of the Quranic verses that have been cited to outlaw [[homosexuality]], principally the verse relating to the story of [[Islamic view of Lot|Lot]] (see Qur'an verses: 11:69-83, 29:28-35). Quranic verses appear to relate specifically to male homosexuality. Contemporary interpreters and campaigning organisations are working to reinterpret texts to allow for a wider spectrum of sexual relationships, including homosexual and [[bisexual]] but there is much resistance from the mainstream Muslim community.&lt;ref name="safra" /&gt;

==Dress codes==
{{See also|Sartorial hijab|Islam and clothing|Awrah|Purdah}}
Another issue that concerns Muslim women is the [[dress code]] expected of them. In some cultures such as [[Afghanistan]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] they are expected to wear the all-covering ''[[burqa]]'' or ''[[abaya]]''; in others, such as [[Tunisia]] and [[Turkey]] they are forbidden to wear even the [[headscarf]] (often known as the ''[[hijab]]'') in public buildings. There is mixed opinion among Muslim feminists over extremes of externally imposed control. 

However, a number of Islamic feminists, including [[Fadela Amara]] and [http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9di_M'henni Hedi Mhenni] support bans on hijab, for various reasons.  
Muslim feminist Fadela Amara explained her support for France's ban on the hijab in public buildings: "The veil is the visible symbol of the subjugation of women, and therefore has no place in the mixed, [[secular]] spaces of France's public school system."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/jul/17/france.politicsphilosophyandsociety&lt;/ref&gt;

When some feminists began defending the headscarf on the grounds of "tradition", Amara saw red. "It's not tradition, it's archaic! French feminists are totally contradictory. When Algerian women fought against wearing the headscarf in Algeria, French feminists supported them. But when it's some young girl in a [[France|French]] suburb school, they don't. They define [[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|liberty and equality]] according to what colour your skin is. It's nothing more than neocolonialism."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/jul/17/france.politicsphilosophyandsociety&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9di_M'henni Hedi Mhenni] also expressed support for the Tunisia's ban on the veil: 
"If today we accept the headscarf, tomorrow we'll accept that women's rights to work and vote and receive an education be banned and they'll be seen as just a tool for reproduction and housework."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.islamonline.net/English/News/2006-10/06/06.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic feminists, Muslim feminists and Islamists==
There are subtle yet substantial differences to be noted between the terms 'Islamic feminist', 'Muslim feminist' and those regarded as '[[Islamists]]'. Islamic feminists ground their arguments in Islam and its teachings&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/2004/16-31Jan04-Print-Edition/1631200425.htm ‘Islamic feminism means justice to women’, The Milli Gazette, Vol.5 No.02, MG96 (16-31 Jan 04)&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;, seek the full equality of women and men in the personal and public sphere and can include non-Muslims in the discourse and debate. 

Differently, Muslim feminists are people who consider themselves Muslims and feminist but who may use arguments outside Islam, for example, national secular law or international [[human rights]] agreements, to counter gender inequality. [[Islamists]] are advocates of [[Political aspects of Islam|political Islam]], the notion that the [[Quran]] and ''[[hadith]]'' mandate an [[caliphate|Islamic government]].
