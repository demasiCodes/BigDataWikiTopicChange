Its aims are the full [[equality]] of all [[Muslim]]s, male and female, in private and public life.

Islamic feminism is defined by Islamic scholars as being more radical than [[Secularism|secular]] [[feminism]], [http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/569/cu1.htm] and as being anchored within the [[discourse]] of Islam with the [[Qur'an]] as its central text. [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?topic_id=1426&amp;fuseaction=topics.event_summary&amp;event_id=42775]

The use of the term remains limited, and its ideas [[Controversy|controversial]].
