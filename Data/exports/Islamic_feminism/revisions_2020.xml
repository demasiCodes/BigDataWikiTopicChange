==Definitions==
===Islamic feminists===
{{Main|Hermeneutics of feminism in Islam}}
Islamic feminists [[Hermeneutics of feminism in Islam|interpret the religious texts]] in a [[Feminism|feminist]] perspective. They can be viewed as a branch of interpreters who ground their arguments in Islam and its teachings,&lt;ref name="milligazette.com"/&gt; seek gender justice and the full [[Gender equality|equality of women and men]] in the personal and public sphere, and can include non-Muslims in the discourse and debate.

Islamic feminism is defined by [[Islamic scholars]] as being more radical than secular [[feminism]],&lt;ref name="weekly.ahram.org.eg"/&gt; and as being anchored within the [[discourse]] of Islam with the Quran as its central text.&lt;ref name="Exploring Islamic Feminism"/&gt;

During recent times, the concept of Islamic feminism has grown further with Islamic groups looking to garner support from many aspects of society. In addition, educated Muslim women are striving to articulate their role in society.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.monitor.upeace.org/innerpg.cfm?id_article=789] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410054924/http://www.monitor.upeace.org/innerpg.cfm?id_article=789 |date=2011-04-10 }} Rob L. Wagner: "Saudi-Islamic Feminist Movement: A Struggle for Male Allies and the Right Female Voice", University for Peace (Peace and Conflict Monitor), March 29, 2011
&lt;/ref&gt;

Umm Yasmin, of the Centre for Muslim Minorities and Islam, says that feminism is often mistaken as a western movement, but that Muslim feminists have been active since the early nineteenth century.  Muslim feminists tasks aren't to reform the religion of Islam, but rather "promote gender equality within a secular society".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/shadya/muslimfeminism.html|title=Independent Lens .

In reforming these social issues, Muslim women started advocating for legal change, establishing schools for girls, and opposing to veiling and polygyny.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2510|title=Women and Islam - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|access-date=2019-10-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190430032344/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2510|archive-date=2019-04-30|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In support of Yasmin's argument, [[Fatema Mernissi]] undermines that the ideal Muslim woman being portrayed as "silent and obedient" has nothing to do with the message of Islam.  In her view, conservative Muslim men manipulated the religious texts of the Quran to preserve their patriarchal system in order to prevent women from sexual liberation; thus enforcing justification of strict veiling and limitation rights.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0527|title=Mernissi, Fatima|last=Rassam|first=Amal|website=Oxford Islamic Studies|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190108020056/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0527|archive-date=January 8, 2019|access-date=October 24, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminism in Islam ===
{{Main|Hermeneutics of feminism in Islam}}
Margot Badran says that Islamic feminism "derives its understanding and mandate from the Qur’an, seeks rights and justice for women, and for men, in the totality of their existence."&lt;ref&gt;Badran, Margot. Feminism in Islam : Secular and Religious Convergences. Oxford : Oneworld, 2009., 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; She explains in her writings that radical Islamists (political Islam) have corrupted Islam with the image of patriarchy and oppression to women. This image is what the rest of the world sees and understands Islam to be.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|last=Badran|first=Margot|date=9 November 2008|title=Margot Badran: What does Islamic feminism have to offer? Where does it come from? Where is it going?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2008/nov/09/islam-women|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201232847/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2008/nov/09/islam-women|archive-date=2017-12-01|access-date=2017-12-01|website=the Guardian}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asma Barlas]] shares Badran's views, discussing the difference between secular feminists and Islamic feminism and in countries where Muslims make up 98% of the population, it is not possible to avoid engaging “its basic beliefs.”&lt;ref&gt;
(https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2008/nov/09/islam-women {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201232847/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2008/nov/09/islam-women|date=2017-12-01}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Fatima Seedat agrees with both Barlas and Badran about the importance of feminism in the Islamic world. However, she debates the term “Islamic Feminism” is unnecessary since feminism is a “social practice, not merely of personal identity.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seedat | first1 = Fatima | year = 2016 | title = Beyond the Text: Between Islam and Feminism | journal = Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion | volume = 32 | issue = 2| page = 138 | doi = 10.2979/jfemistudreli.32.2.23 | s2cid = 151549625 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Seedat believes the convergence of both Islamic and feminism creates more conflict and opens more doors for “Islamists” to interpret or misinterpret the Qur'an to suit their political needs. She believes it is important to speak about and illustrate how feminism has existed in the lines of the Qur'an. By separating the two and giving their own space, it will be more inclusive to everyone (men, women, Muslims and non-Muslims). In the same article, “Feminism, and Islamic Feminism: Between Inadequacy and Inevitability,” Seedat explains that the existence of such a term separates Muslims and isolates them from the rest of the world and the universal feminist movement. She states in her essay the importance of sharing with the rest of the world what Islam has to offer feminism, and to show the true image of Islam by not referring to themselves as Islamic feminists.&lt;ref&gt;

Moroccan writer and sociologist, [[Fatema Mernissi]] is widely recognized as the founder of modern Islamic feminism.{{Cn|date=June 2020}}  Her famous feminist piece ''Beyond the Veil'' exploits the oppressive status of women in Islam, sexual ideology and gender identity through the perspective of Moroccan society and culture.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;  ''Beyond the Veil''  argues against the discourse on women's sexuality by breaking their silence with providing a voice against the dominance of male patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mernissi|first=Fatema|url=https://archive.org/details/beyondveilrevise00fati_0|title=Beyond the Veil: Male-Female Dynamics in a Muslim Society|publisher=Schenkman Publishing Company|year=1975|isbn=978-0253204233|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-nineteenth century role models acceptable to modern Islamic feminists===
[[Khawlah bint al-Azwar|Khawla bint al-Azwar]], was a legendary female Muslim warrior/soldier during the life of the prophet Mohammad.  Her brother, [[Dhiraar bin Al-Azwar|Dhiraar al-Azwar]], trained her to fight and she fought with him in many battles.  It is said that it was not known that she was a female when in battle because all soldiers were dressed in loose clothing and wrapped themselves in cloth to protect themselves from the sand and dust. After proving herself as a soldier by showing her talent and skill in combat, she revealed herself to the men she fought next to.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

==History and context==
Ahmed Elewa and Laury Silvers say that, in the past 150 years or so, many scholarly interpretations have been developed from within Islamic tradition itself that seek to redress grave social wrongs perpetrated against [[Women in Islam|Muslim women]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, [[Hermeneutics of feminism in Islam|new Islamic jurisprudence]] is emerging that seek to forbid social evils like [[Female genital mutilation|female genital mutilations]], and equalize family codes (Personal law), clergy, administration-level equal-participatory opportunities in mosques for women, equal opportunities for Muslim women to become judges in civil as well as religious institutions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Ahmed Elewa and Laury Silvers say that modern scholars perceive their work as restoration of rights provided by God and the prophet but denied by society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The Muslim world is going through change and upheaval; Islamic states will need to democratize with a focus on human rights, social justice and gender equality.   Muslim women with tools of Islamic feminism are playing  important role in an ongoing process of change. For example, in 2012, Jordanian women protested against laws that allowed the dropping of charges if a rapist marries his victim, Tunisian women marched for equality for women in a new constitution, Saudi women protested against the ban against car driving, Sudanese women created a silent wall of protest demanding freedom for arrested women.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Elizabeth Segran describes the Islamic feminist struggle of Malaysian activist [[Zainah Anwar]], and states that just talking about human rights mentioned in the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) does not create immediate resonance with ordinary women; since Islam is the source of their values, integrating human rights frameworks with Islam makes sense.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Islamists===
[[Islamists]] are advocates of [[Political aspects of Islam|political Islam]], the notion that the Quran and [[hadith]] mandate a [[caliphate]], i.e. an Islamic government. Some Islamists advocate women's rights in the [[public sphere]] but do not challenge [[gender inequality]] in the personal, [[private sphere]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Su'ad al-Fatih al-Badawi]], a Sudanese academic and Islamist politician, has argued that feminism is incompatible with ''[[taqwa]]'' (the Islamic conception of piety), and thus Islam and feminism are mutually exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hale|first=Sondra|title=Women and Globalization in the Arab Middle East: Gender, Economy, and Society|date=2013|publisher=Lynne Rienner|isbn=978-1588261342|editor1-last=Doumato|editor1-first=Eleanor|pages=208|chapter=Sudanese Women in National Service, Militias &amp; the Home|editor2-last=Posusney|editor2-first=Marsha|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xq0WKr_yFCYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margot Badran of Georgetown University's Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding (now the [[Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding]]) argues that Islam and feminism are not mutually exclusive and that "Islamic feminism, which derives its understanding and mandate from the Qur'an, seeks rights and justice for women, and for men, in the totality of their existence. Islamic feminism is both highly contested and firmly embraced."&lt;ref&gt;

===Nineteenth century===
The modern movement of Islamic feminism began in the nineteenth century. The [[Persian poetry|Iranian poet]] [[Táhirih]] was the first modern woman to undertake Qur'anic [[exegesis]]. Born and raised in a traditional Muslim family, she became a prominent member of the [[Bábism|Bábí Faith]], during which time she openly denounced polygyny, the wearing of the veil, and other restraints put upon women. One of her most notable quotes is her final utterance prior to her execution in August 1852, "You can kill me as soon as you like, but you cannot stop the emancipation of women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Maneck | first =Susan Stiles | editor-last =Āfāqī | editor-first =Ṣābir | editor2-last =Jasion | editor2-first =Jan T. | title =Táhirih in History: Perspectives on Qurratu'l-'Ayn from East and West | chapter =Táhirih: A Religious Paradigm of Womanhood | chapter-url =https://books.google.com/books?id=u_4CBxfhsnIC&amp;pg=PA185 | publisher =Kalimat Press | series =RENNER studies on new religions | volume =7 | year =2004 | pages =185–201 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=u_4CBxfhsnIC | isbn =978-1-890688-35-6 | access-date =2017-02-10 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20170216213233/https://books.google.com/books?id=u_4CBxfhsnIC | archive-date =2017-02-16 | url-status =live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptian jurist [[Qasim Amin]], the author of the 1899 pioneering book ''Women's Liberation'' (''Tahrir al-Mar'a''), is often described as the father of the [[Feminism in Egypt|Egyptian feminist movement]]. In his work, Amin criticized some of the practices prevalent in his society at the time, such as [[Polygyny in Islam|polygyny]], [[Islam and clothing|the veil]], and ''[[purdah]]'', i.e. [[sex segregation in Islam]]. He condemned them as un-Islamic and contradictory to the true spirit of Islam. His work had an enormous influence on women's political movements throughout the Islamic and [[Arab world]], and is read and cited today.

Despite Qasim Amin's effects on modern-day Islamic feminist movements, present-day scholar [[Leila Ahmed]] considers his works both [[androcentric]] and [[colonialist]].&lt;ref&gt;Leila Ahmed. Women and Gender in Islam. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1992. pp.155-163, 171, 179.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhammad Abduh|Muhammad 'Abdu]], an Egyptian nationalist&lt;ref&gt;Leila Ahmed. Women and Gender in Islam. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1992. pp.136-137.&lt;/ref&gt; and proponent of [[Islamic modernism]], could easily have written the chapters of his work that show honest considerations of the negative effects of the veil on women.&lt;ref&gt;Leila Ahmed. Women and Gender in Islam. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1992. pp.159,161.&lt;/ref&gt; Amin even posed many male-centered misconceptions about women, such as their inability to experience love, that women needlessly (when they had very good reason to) talk about their husbands outside their presence, and that Muslim marriage is based on ignorance and sensuality, of which women were the chief source.&lt;ref&gt;Leila Ahmed. Women and Gender in Islam. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1992. pp.157-159.&lt;/ref&gt;

Less known, however, are the women who preceded Amin in their feminist critique of their societies. The women's press in Egypt started voicing such concerns since its very first issues in 1892. Egyptian, Turkish, Iranian, Syrian and Lebanese women and men had been reading European feminist magazines even a decade earlier, and discussed their relevance to the Middle East in the general press.&lt;ref&gt;

===Twentieth century===
[[Aisha Abd al-Rahman]], writing under her pen name ''Bint al-Shati'' ("Daughter of the Riverbank"), was the second modern woman to undertake Quranic [[exegesis]], and though she did not consider herself to be a feminist, her works reflect feminist themes. She began producing her popular books in 1959, the same year that [[Naguib Mahfouz]] published his allegorical and feminist version of the life of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Ruth|last=Roded|title=Bint al-Shati's Wives of the Prophet: Feminist or Feminine?|journal=British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies|date=May 2006|volume=33|issue=1|pages=51–66|doi=10.1080/13530190600603915|s2cid=159905564}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote biographies of early [[women in Islam]], including the [[Aminah bint Wahb|mother]], wives and [[Family tree of Muhammad|daughters]] of the [[Prophets of Islam|Prophet]] Muhammad, as well as [[literary criticism]].&lt;ref name="zeidan"&gt;Arab Women Novelists: The Formative Years and Beyond by Joseph T. Zeidan, State University of New York Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fatema Mernissi]] has argued that much of the suppression of women's rights in Islamic societies is the result of political motivation and its consequent manipulative interpretation of hadith, which runs counter to the egalitarian Islamic community of men and women envisioned by Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mernissi |first=Fatima |author-link=Fatima Mernissi |year=1992 |title=The Veil and the Male Elite: A Feminist Interpretation of Islam |publisher=New York: Basic Books |isbn=978-0201-63221-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/veilmaleelite00mern }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some strains of modern Islamic feminism have opted to expunge hadith from their ideology altogether in favor of a movement focusing only on Qur'anic principles. [[Riffat Hassan]] has advocated one such movement, articulating a theology wherein what are deemed to be universal rights for humanity outlined in the Qur'an are prioritized over contextual laws and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Hassan, Riffat. "Women's Rights inIslam: Normative Teaching versus Practice," in ''Islam and Human Rights: Advancing a U.S.- Muslim Dialogue'', edited by Shireen T. Hunter with Huma Malik, The CSIS Press, Washington D.C., 2005, pp. 43-66.&lt;/ref&gt; She has additionally claimed that the Qur'an, taken alone as scripture, does not present females either as a creation preceded by the male or as the instigator of the "[[Original sin|Fall of Man]]".&lt;ref&gt;Hassan, Riffat. "Woman and Man's "fall": A Qur'anic Theological Perspective," in ''Muslima Theology: The Voices of Muslim Women Theologians'', edited by Ednan Aslan, Marcia Hermansen, and Elif Medini, Peter Lang, Frankfurt, 2013, pp. 101-113.&lt;/ref&gt; This theological movement has been met with criticism from other Muslim feminists such as Kecia Ali, who has criticized its selective nature for ignoring elements within the Muslim tradition that could prove helpful in establishing more egalitarian norms in Islamic society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sexual Ethics &amp; Islam|last = Ali|first = Kecia|publisher = Oneworld|year = 2006|isbn = 978-1-85168-456-4|location = London|pages = 154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan]] (RAWA) is a women's organization based in [[Quetta]], Pakistan, that promotes women's rights and [[secular democracy]]. The organization aims to involve [[women in Afghanistan|women of Afghanistan]] in both political and social activities aimed at acquiring their [[human rights]] and continuing the struggle against the [[government of Afghanistan]] based on democratic and secular - not fundamentalist - principles, in which women can participate fully.&lt;ref name=Lantos&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lantos.house.gov/HoR/CA12/Human+Rights+Caucus/Briefing+Testimonies/Fahima+Vorgetts.htm |title=RAWA testimony to the Congressional Human Rights Caucus Briefing |publisher=U.S. Congressional Human Rights Caucus |date=December 18, 2001 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628022728/http://lantos.house.gov/HoR/CA12/Human+Rights+Caucus/Briefing+Testimonies/Fahima+Vorgetts.htm |archive-date=June 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization was founded in 1977 by a group of intellectuals led by [[Meena Keshwar Kamal|Meena]] (she did not use a last name). They founded the organization to promote equality and education for women; it continues to "give voice to the deprived and silenced women of Afghanistan". Before 1978, RAWA focused mainly on women's rights and democracy, but after the coup of 1978, directed by Moscow, and the 1979 Soviet Occupation of Afghanistan, "Rawa became directly involved in the war of resistance, advocating democracy and secularism from the outset".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1979 RAWA campaigned against the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]], and organized meetings in schools to mobilize support against it, and in 1981, launched a bilingual [[List of feminist art magazines|feminist magazine]], ''[[Payam-e-Zan]]'' (Women's Message).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mehta, Sunita.

===Twenty-first century===
In 2015 a group of Muslim activists, politicians, and writers issued a Declaration of Reform which, among other things, supports women's rights and states in part, "We support equal rights for women, including equal rights to inheritance, witness, work, mobility, personal law, education, and employment. Men and women have equal rights in mosques, boards, leadership and all spheres of society. We reject [[sexism]] and [[misogyny]]."&lt;ref name="secularism1"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration also announced the founding of the [[Muslim Reform Movement]] organization to work against the beliefs of Middle Eastern terror groups.&lt;ref name="washingtontimes.com"&gt;

Feminism in the Middle East is over a century old, and having been impacted directly by the war on terror in Afghanistan, continues to grow and fight for women's rights and equality in all conversations of power and everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently an ongoing debate about the actual status of women in Islam, with both conservatives and Islamic feminists using the Quran, the hadith, and prominent women in Muslim history as evidence for the discussion on women's rights, with feminists arguing that early Islam represented more egalitarian ideals, while conservatives argue that gender asymmetries are "divinely ordained".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mojab|first=Shahrzad|date=2001-11-01|title=Theorizing the Politics of 'Islamic Feminism'|journal=Feminist Review|language=en|volume=69|issue=1|pages=124–146|doi=10.1080/01417780110070157|s2cid=143067473|issn=0141-7789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Muslim women's quest for equality====
Groups like Sisters in Islam and RAWA, have done substantial work in uniting members of Islam for the uplifting of women.  Major members of this movement have argued for increased recognition in theological approaches as seen when Ziba Mir-Hosseini says:&lt;blockquote&gt;‘Secular feminism has fulfilled its historical role but it has nothing more to give us’ […] I will simply repeat here that rejection was not my intent, but rather, then as now, I call for a reconciliation and transcendence of the distinction. We are all heading in the same direction, but we also need to recognise and value the diversity in our approaches and create spaces where different feminisms and voices can work together towards the same goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mir-Hosseini|first=Ziba|date=1 January 2011|title=Beyond 'Islam' vs. 'Feminism'|url=http://www.zibamirhosseini.com/documents/mir-hosseini-article-beyond-islam-vs-feminism--2011.pdf|journal=IDS Bulletin|volume=42|pages=67–77|doi=10.1111/j.1759-5436.2011.00202.x|access-date=2 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221030717/http://www.zibamirhosseini.com/documents/mir-hosseini-article-beyond-islam-vs-feminism--2011.pdf|archive-date=21 December 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Many Islamic feminists argue that their inequality doesn't come from the Koran, but how people have interpreted the messages of the Koran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/16/world/asia/16women.html|title=In Quest for Equal Rights, Muslim Women's Meeting Turns to Islam's Tenets|last=Tavernise|first=Sabrina|date=15 February 2009|work=New York Times|access-date=2 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191028231704/https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/16/world/asia/16women.html|archive-date=28 October 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More specific efforts include those of the group Muslim Women's Quest for Equality when they petitioned the [[Supreme Court of India]] against the practices of ''[[w:Divorce in Islam|talaq-e-bidat]]'' (triple talaq), ''[[nikah halala]]'' and [[Polygyny in Islam|polygyny]] under the Muslim personal laws illegal and [[Constitution of India|unconstitutional]]&lt;ref&gt;

==== Musawah ====
In 2009, twelve women from the Arab world formed the global movement [[Musawah]], whose name means "equality" in Arabic. Musawah advocates for feminist interpretations of Islamic texts and calls on nations to abide by international human rights standards such as those promulgated in the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]]. Musawah's approach is modeled after that of Sisters in Islam. [[Secular feminism|Secular feminists]] have criticized Musawah, arguing that Islam is shaky ground on which to build a feminist movement, given that interpretation of Islamic sources is subjective.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;

Musawah movement operates on the principle  that patriarchy within Muslim countries is a result of the way male interpreters have read Islamic texts.&lt;ref name="Nation" /&gt;  and that feminists can  progressively interpretate the [[Quran]] to achieve goal of [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|international human rights standards]].&lt;ref name="Nation" /&gt; A first female Muslim clerics congress was held in Indonesia in 2017.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Post|first=The Jakarta|title=EDITORIAL: Women ulema for the world|url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2017/04/28/editorial-women-ulema-for-the-world.html|access-date=2020-05-31|website=The Jakarta Post|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim women clerics congress issued a fatwa to lift the minimum age for girls to marry to 18.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Malaysian feminist [[Zainah Anwar]] informed  the women clerics congress that women do have equal right to define Islam and that women need to fight against male domination in Quranic interpretations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  During the congress, Nur Rofiah, a professor in Quranic studies stated that, Islam asks every human being has to elevate the status of humankind, and polygamy does not, and that polygamy is not the teaching of Islam&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

One of such controversial interpretations involve passages in the Quran that discuss the idea of a man's religious obligation to support women.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fluehr-Lobban |first1=Carolyn |title=Toward a Theory of Arab-Muslim Women as Activists in Secular and Religious Movements |journal=Arab Studies Quarterly |date=1993 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=87–106 |jstor=41858975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars, such as anthropologist [[Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban]] in her work on Arab-Muslim women activists' engagement in secular religious movements, argue that this assertion of a religious obligation "has traditionally been used as a rationale for the social practice of male authority."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In some countries the legislative and administrative application of male authority is used to justify denying women access to the public sphere through the "denial of permission to travel or work outside the home, or even drive a car."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; On Sept. 26, 2017 [[Saudi Arabia]] announced it would end its longstanding policy banning women from driving in June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; by posting videos of them driving on social media platforms.

Islamic feminists have objected to the MPL legislation in many of these countries, arguing that these pieces of legislation discriminate against women. Some Islamic feminists have taken the attitude that a reformed MPL which is based on the Quran and [[sunnah]], which includes substantial input from Muslim women, and which does not discriminate against women is possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Rights In Islam|last=Chaudry|first=Muhammad Sharif|publisher=Adam &amp; Distributors|year=1991|location=Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such Islamic feminists have been working on developing women-friendly forms of MPL. (See, for example, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070626213151/http://www.ccmw.com/GTAForum/index.htm the Canadian Council of Muslim Women] for argument based on the Qur'an and not on what they call medieval male consensus.) Other Islamic feminists, particularly some in Muslim minority contexts which are democratic states, argue that MPL should not be reformed but should be rejected and that Muslim women should seek redress, instead, from the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]s of those states. &lt;!--this paragraph needs to cite sources and name the women or groups, instead of "some Islamic feminists."--&gt;

[[File:Hijab Niqab Muslim Veil.jpg|thumb|Mannequins showing different styles of hijab head-covering]]
Another issue that concerns Muslim women is the [[dress code]] expected of them. Islam requires both men and women to dress modestly; this concept is known as ''[[hijab]]'' and covers a wide interpretation of behavior and garments.  There is mixed opinion among Muslim feminists concerning externally imposed control. Sufi groups such as [[Al-Ahbash]] do not make it mandatory for women to wear traditional Islamic clothing, even allowing jeans.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last1=Elrich |first1=Hagai |title=Al-Ahbash and Wahabi |publisher=Cambridge University |page=528 |url=http://aigaforum.com/documents/Al-Ahbash-whaibyya.pdf |access-date=2018-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215113032/http://aigaforum.com/documents/Al-Ahbash-whaibyya.pdf |archive-date=2017-12-15 |url-status=live }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Islamic feminists, including [[Fadela Amara]] and [[:fr:Hédi M'henni|Hedi Mhenni]], support bans on the ''hijab'' for various reasons. Amara explained her support for [[Islamic scarf controversy in France|France's ban of the garment in public buildings]]: "The veil is the visible symbol of the subjugation of women, and therefore has no place in the mixed, [[Laïcité|secular spaces]] of [[education in France|France's public school system]]."&lt;ref name="guardian17Jul2006"&gt;
{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jul/17/france.politicsphilosophyandsociety | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Ghetto warrior | date=July 17, 2006 | access-date=May 5, 2010 | first=Rose | last=George | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830072547/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jul/17/france.politicsphilosophyandsociety | archive-date=2013-08-30 | url-status=live }}
&lt;/ref&gt; When some feminists began defending the headscarf on the grounds of "tradition", Amara said: "It's not tradition, it's archaic! French feminists are totally contradictory.

[[Sihem Habchi]], director of [[Ni Putes Ni Soumises]], expressed support for [[Hijab by country#France|France's ban on the burqa in public places]], stating that the ban was a matter of 'democratic principle' and protecting French women from the 'obscurantist, fascist, right-wing movement' that she claims the burqa represents.&lt;ref&gt;

Alternatively, there is also strong support in favor of the veil. Both men and women now view the veil as a symbol of Islamic freedom. As a growing number of individuals have accepted and incorporated the hijab into their cultural dress, women are beginning to reclaim the meaning behind the veil. The veil itself acts as a different experience lived by each woman who wears it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; “It is no longer a bandanna version of the all-encompassing Afghan burqa, signaling a woman's brainwashed submissiveness or at the very least her lack of choice”.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Many scholars agree that there is no scripture that requires women to wear the hijab but many still do as an act of religious piety.

A growing number of women have begun to incorporate the hijab into their cultural dress, whether they live in predominantly Muslim countries or not. The veil itself acts as a different experience lived by each woman who wears it, rather than a homogenizing item of clothing. Over the past ten years, the hijab has become more prominent in countries of the world where wearing the hijab itself is not required of women by state law.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berger |first1=Anne-Emmanuelle |title=The Newly Veiled Woman: Irigaray, Specularity, and the Islamic Veil |journal=Diacritics |date=1998 |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=93–119 |jstor=1566326|doi=10.1353/dia.1998.0001 |s2cid=170559271 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The willingness to wear the veil outside of required states acts as a radical statement in some instances, in a way reclaiming the symbol and meaning of the veil. Where the veil once stereotypically represented the oppression of women, it now acts as a power statement of pride in religion, femininity, and sexual identity. [[Feminist philosophy|Feminist philosophers]] such as [[Luce Irigaray]] also note that the veil can take on the role of empowerment regarding a woman's sexual difference from man.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Equality in the Mosque===
{{See also|Islamic Bill of Rights for Women in the Mosque}}
A survey by the [[Council on American Islamic Relations]] showed that two out of three mosques in 2000 required women to pray in a separate area, up from one out of two in 1994.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast1"&gt;{{cite web |author=Asra Q.

&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2003, [[Asra Nomani]] challenged the rules at her mosque in Morgantown, West Virginia, that required women to enter through a back door and pray in a secluded balcony.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast1"/&gt;  She argued that Muhammad didn't put women behind partitions, and that barriers preventing women from praying equally with men are just sexist man-made rules.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast1"/&gt;  The men at her mosque put her on trial to be banished.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast1"/&gt;

In 2004, some American mosques had constitutions prohibiting women from voting in board elections.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/22/us/muslim-women-seeking-a-place-in-the-mosque.html|title=Muslim Women Seeking a Place in the Mosque|date=22 July 2004|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701103425/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/22/us/muslim-women-seeking-a-place-in-the-mosque.html|archive-date=2017-07-01|url-status=live}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, following public agitation on the issue, Muslim organizations that included the CAIR and the [[Islamic Society of North America]] issued a report on making mosques "women-friendly", to assert women's rights in mosques, and to include women's right to pray in the main hall without a partition.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast1"/&gt;

In 2010, American Muslim Fatima Thompson and a few others organized and participated in a "pray-in" at the Islamic Center of Washington in D.C.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast1"/&gt; Police were summoned and threatened to arrest the women when they refused to leave the main prayer hall. The women continued their protest against being corralled in what they referred to as the "[[penalty box]]" (a prayer space reserved for only women). Thompson called the penalty box "an overheated, dark back room."&lt;ref name="thedailybeast1"/&gt;  A second protest also staged by the same group on the eve of [[International Women's Day]] in 2010 resulted in calls to the police and threats of arrest again.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast1"/&gt;  However, the women were not arrested on either occasion.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast1"/&gt; In May 2010, five women prayed with men at the [[Dar al-Hijrah]] mosque, one of the Washington region's largest Islamic centers.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt;  After the prayers, a member of the mosque called Fairfax police who asked the women to leave.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt;  However, later in 2010, it was decided that D.C. police would no longer intervene in such protests.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |last=Myers |first=Bill |date=21 June 2010 |title=Police won't intervene to remove women from mosques |url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/d.c.-police-wont-intervene-to-remove-women-from-mosques/article/12885 |work=Washington Examiner |access-date=August 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827094134/http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/d.c.-police-wont-intervene-to-remove-women-from-mosques/article/12885 |archive-date=2016-08-27 |url-status=live }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a group of Muslim activists, politicians, and writers issued a Declaration of Reform which states in part, "Men and women have equal rights in mosques, boards, leadership and all spheres of society. We reject sexism and misogyny."&lt;ref name="secularism1"/&gt; That same year Asra Nomani and others placed the Declaration on the door of the Islamic Center of Washington.&lt;ref name="washingtontimes.com"/&gt;

===Equality in leading prayer===
{{Main|Women as imams}}

In 'A Survey and Analysis of Legal Arguments on Woman-Led Prayer in Islam named “I am one of the People”' Ahmed Elewa state that not because of external expectation but in due course  with enlightened awareness Muslim communities should adopt women lead mixed gender prayers, in the same research paper Laury Silvers emphasizes on example of Umm Salama  who insisted that women are 'One of the people' and suggests women to assert their inclusion with equal rights. Ahmed Elewa and Laury Silvers  research calls contemporary prohibitions of women lead prayer frustrating.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Elewa|first1=Ahmed|last2=Silvers|first2=Laury|date=2010/ed|title="I am one of the People": A Survey and Analysis of Legal Arguments on Woman-Led Prayer in Islam1|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-law-and-religion/article/i-am-one-of-the-people-a-survey-and-analysis-of-legal-arguments-on-womanled-prayer-in-islam1/269FE071D66D033CB92D0F11A283159F|journal=Journal of Law and Religion|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=141–171|doi=10.1017/S074808140000093X|issn=0748-0814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to currently existing traditional schools of Islam, a woman cannot lead a mixed gender congregation in salat (prayer). Traditionalist like [[Muzammil H. Siddiqi|Muzammil Siddiqi]] states that women are not supposed to lead prayer because “It is not permissible to introduce any new style or liturgy in Salat.” In other words, there must be no deviation from the tradition of men teaching.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web|title=Woman Imam Leading Men and Women in Salat - IslamiCity|url=http://www.islamicity.org/2576/woman-imam-leading-men-and-women-in-salat/.|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027151744/https://www.islamicity.org/2576/woman-imam-leading-men-and-women-in-salat/|archive-date=2018-10-27|access-date=2018-10-27|website=www.islamicity.org|language=en-US}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools make exceptions for [[Tarawih]] (optional [[Ramadan]] prayers) or for a congregation consisting only of close relatives. Certain medieval scholars—including [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]] (838–923), [[Abu Thawr]] (764–854), Isma'il Ibn Yahya al-Muzani (791–878), and [[Ibn Arabi]] (1165–1240) considered the practice permissible at least for optional (''[[Nafl prayer|nafl]]'') prayers; however, their views are not accepted by any major surviving group. Islamic feminists have begun to protest this.

On March 18, 2005, [[Amina Wadud]] led a mixed-gender congregational Friday prayer in New York City. It sparked a controversy within the Muslim community because the imam was a woman, Wadud, who also delivered the khutbah.&lt;ref name=Hammer&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammer|first=Juliane|title=American Muslim Women, Religious Authority, and Activism|year=2012|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the congregation she addressed was not separated by gender. This event that departed from the established ritual practice became an embodied performance of gender justice in the eyes of its organizers and participants. The event was widely publicized in the global media and caused an equally global debate among Muslims.&lt;ref name=Hammer /&gt; However, many Muslims, including women, remain in disagreement with the idea of a woman as imam. Muzammil Siddiqi, chairman of the Fiqh Council of North America, argued that prayer leadership should remain restricted to men&lt;ref name=Hammer /&gt;  He based his argument on the longstanding practice and thus community consensus and emphasized the danger of women distracting men during prayers.

The events that occurred in regards to equality in the mosque and women leading prayers, show the enmity Muslim feminists may receive when voicing opposition toward sexism and establishing efforts to combat it. Those who criticize Muslim feminists state that those who question the faith's views on gender segregation, or who attempt to make changes, are overstepping their boundaries and are acting offensively. On the other hand, people have stated that Islam does not advocate gender segregation. Britain's influential Sunni imam, [[Ahtsham Ali]], has stated, "gender segregation has no basis in Islamic law" nor is it justified in the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/08/02/UK-imam-Quran-does-not-justify-gender-segregation-.html|title=British imam: Quran does not rule on segregation|website=english.alarabiya.net|access-date=2015-05-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808110851/http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/08/02/UK-imam-Quran-does-not-justify-gender-segregation-.html|archive-date=2014-08-08|url-status=live}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmed Elewa and Laury Silvers deduce that  with lack of any explicit evidence to contrary one ought to assume, women lead prayer adds nothing new to God established worship but just a  default state of command expects men and women both to lead the prayer.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Criticism ==

===Conservative Islamist views and criticism of (Islamic) feminists ===
In ''[[Sahih Muslim]]'', a canonical book of [[hadith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sahih Muslim|work=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|author=John L. Esposito (ed)|publisher= Oxford Islamic Studies Online|access-date=30 June 2020|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2057?_hi=2&amp;_pos=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Huraira]] (one of the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]]) reported that a person came to the Prophet and asked: "Who among the people is most deserving of a fine treatment from my hand? He said: Your mother. He again said: Then who? He said: Again it is your mother. He said: Then who ? He said: Again, it is your mother. He said: Then who? Thereupon he said: Then it is your father."  This is one example that many scholars{{Who|date=June 2020}} use to show the inclusion of women and their rights in the Quran/Islam.

From the Quran: Surah 4:19&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-4/verse-19/|title=Quran Surah An-Nisaa ( Verse 19 ) with English Translation يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَنْ تَرِثُوا النِّسَاءَ كَرْهًا ۖ وَلَا تَعْضُلُوهُنَّ لِتَذْهَبُوا بِبَعْضِ مَا آتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ إِلَّا أَنْ يَأْتِينَ بِفَاحِشَةٍ مُبَيِّنَةٍ ۚ وَعَاشِرُوهُنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ۚ فَإِنْ كَرِهْتُمُوهُنَّ فَعَسَىٰ أَنْ تَكْرَهُوا شَيْئًا وَيَجْعَلَ اللَّهُ فِيهِ خَيْرًا كَثِيرًا|website=IReBD.com|access-date=2018-01-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127203217/http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-4/verse-19/|archive-date=2018-01-27|url-status=live}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
O ye who believe! Ye are forbidden to inherit women against their will. Nor should ye treat them with harshness, that ye may take away part of the dower ye have given them,-except where they have been guilty of open lewdness; on the contrary live with them on a footing of kindness and equity. If ye take a dislike to them it may be that ye dislike a thing, and God brings about through it a great deal of good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.call-to-monotheism.com/men_and_women_s_rights_in_islam__equal_or_equally_balanced_|title=Men and Women's Rights in Islam: Equal or Equally Balanced?|website=www.call-to-monotheism.com|access-date=2017-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202052641/http://www.call-to-monotheism.com/men_and_women_s_rights_in_islam__equal_or_equally_balanced_|archive-date=2017-12-02|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this scripture it is explained by Sahih Muslim that this speaks to men to take care of their wives, and those who do not will suffer the consequences.  Naik explains that this is not to give men a higher status than women, but to give them the role of caretaker because they are created physically stronger than women.  He stresses on the different roles they are given as men and women because of how God created them.  Men are providers and women are the caregivers at home, given more patience, resilience, and the ability to forgive more than men.

The Quran says:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alislam.org/quran/33:36|title=The Holy Quran|website=dx.doi.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191103225627/https://www.alislam.org/quran/33:36|archive-date=2019-11-03|access-date=2019-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surely, men who submit themselves to God and women who submit themselves to Him, and believing men, and believing women, and obedient men and obedient women and truthful men and truthful women, and men steadfast in their faith and steadfast women".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alislam.org/articles/women-in-quran/|title=Women in the Quran|date=2001-02-13|website=Islam Ahmadiyya|language=en|access-date=2019-11-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191103225627/https://www.alislam.org/articles/women-in-quran/|archive-date=2019-11-03|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This demonstrates that Muslim men and women are spiritually regarded as equals and woman can attain the same of devotion to God as men.  Allah created men and women to equally follow the same commandments and entitled the same rights, but only distinguished them based on their marital status.  Men and women are expected to fulfill the same duties; worship, prayer, fasting, almsgiving and pilgrimage to Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2510|title=Women and Islam|website=Oxford Islamic Studies|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622060604/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2510|archive-date=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Quran says: &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2510|title=The Holy Quran|website=Al Islam|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622060604/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2510|archive-date=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; "fear your Lord who created you from a single soul and of its kind created its mate, and from them twain spread many men and women."  Single soul signifies that both sexes are unified together as one soul, belonging to the same species and having the same propensities.{{Cn|date=June 2020}}

The Quran also says in verse 2:282: "O you who believe! When you contract a debt for a fixed period, write it down. Let a scribe write it down in justice between you. Let not the scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught him, so let him write. Let him (the debtor) who incurs the liability dictate, and he must fear Allah, his Lord, and diminish not anything of what he owes. But if the debtor is of poor understanding, or weak, or is unable himself to dictate, then let his guardian dictate in justice. And get two witnesses out of your own men. And if there are not two men (available), then a man and two women, such as you agree for witnesses, so that if one of them (two women) errs, the other can remind her." This implies that the testimony of two women is equivalent to that of a man in financial matters, as women may not be as familiar with matters of finance and debt if they are mainly homemakers. The second woman’s role was mainly as an assistant, to remind the other of anything she may forget. Today, most scholars agree that if a woman has knowledge of finance, her testimony may be regarded as equal to that of a man in such a case.
