'''Islamic feminism''' has its roots in the early [[20th century]], but which expanded in the [[1990s]], when the term was first coined,{{citation needed}} in response to the growth of [[Islamism]] throughout the [[Islamic world]]. Its aims are the full [[equality]] of all [[Muslim]]s, male and female, in private and public life.

Islamic feminism is defined by Islamic scholars as being more radical than [[secular]] [[feminism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/569/cu1.htm "Islamic feminism: what's in a name?"] by Margot Badran, ''Al-Ahram'', January 17&amp;ndash;23, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and as being anchored within the [[discourse]] of Islam with the [[Qur'an]] as its central text.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?topic_id=1426&amp;fuseaction=topics.event_summary&amp;event_id=42775 "Exploring Islamic Feminism"] by Margot Badran, Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding, Georgetown University, November 30, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
