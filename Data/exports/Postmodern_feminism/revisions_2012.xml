'''Postmodern feminism''' is an approach to [[feminist theory]] that incorporates [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] and [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist theory]], and thus sees itself as moving beyond the [[modernist]] polarities of [[liberal feminism]] and [[radical feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi/C. Garratt, ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (1995) p. 100-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Penguin Reference Dictionary of Literary Terms &amp; Literary Theory defines post-modernism, feminism, and post-structuralism, but not postmodern feminism. The definition provided for post-modernism is, “A general (and sometimes controversial) term used to refer to changes, developments, and tendencies which have taken place (and are taking place) in literature, art, music, architecture, philosophy, etc. since the 1940’s or 1950’s.” It goes on to say that Marxist, feminist, and psychoanalytic criticism are all aspects of post-modernism since the 1970’s; and concludes that “When something else develops from it instead of it, it will, perhaps be easier to identify, describe, and classify.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuddon|first=J.A.|title=The Penguin dictionary of literary terms and literary theory|year=1998|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780140513639|pages=689–693|edition=4. ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Feminism has been seen by some as having a special affinity for the postmodern through a shared interest in (the theoretical implications of) social practices and multiple voices.&lt;ref&gt;E. D. Ermath, ''Sequel to History'' (1992) p. 172-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and theory==

===Butler===
Postmodern feminism's major departure from other branches of feminism is perhaps the argument that [[sex]], or at least [[gender]] is itself [[social construction|constructed]] through [[discourse|language]], a view notably propounded in [[Judith Butler]]'s 1990 book, ''[[Gender Trouble]]''. She draws on and critiques the work of [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Jacques Lacan]], as well as on [[Luce Irigaray]]'s argument that what we conventionally regard as 'feminine' is only a reflection of what is constructed as masculine.&lt;ref&gt;G. Gutting ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Foucault'' (2002) p. 389&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler criticises the distinction drawn by previous feminisms between (biological) sex and (socially constructed) [[gender]]. She asks why we assume that material things (such as the body) are not subject to processes of social construction themselves. Butler argues that this does not allow for a sufficient criticism of [[essentialism]]: though recognizing that gender is a social construct, feminists assume it's always constructed in the same way. Her argument implies that [[women]]'s subordination has no single cause or single solution; postmodern feminism is thus criticized for offering no clear path to action.  Butler herself rejects the term "postmodernism" as too vague to be meaningful.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Butler, "Contingent Foundations" in Seyla Benhabib et al., ''Feminist Contentions: A Philosophical Exchange'' (New York: Routledge, 1995), pp. 35-58&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably, Butler derives this rejection to postmodernism from misreadings of Cherrie Moraga’s work. “She reads Moraga’s statement that ‘the danger lies in ranking the oppressions’ to mean that we have no way of adjudicating among different kinds of oppressions—that any attempt to casually relate or hierarchize the varieties of oppressions people suffer constitutes an imperializing, colonizing, or totalizing gesture that renders the effort invalid…thus, although Butler at first appears to have understood the critiques of women who have been historically precluded form occupying the position of the ‘subject’ of feminism, it becomes clear that their voices have been merely instrumental to her” (Moya, 790) Moya contends that because Butler feels that the varieties of oppressions cannot be summarily ranked, that they cannot be ranked at all; and takes a short-cut by throwing out the idea of not only postmodernism, but women in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gubar|first=[edited by] Sandra M. Gilbert, Susan|title=Feminist literary theory and criticism : a Norton reader|year=2007|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York|isbn=9780393927900|pages=787–797|author=Paula M.L. Moya|edition=1st ed.|authorlink=From Postmodernism, "Realism," and the Politics of Identity: Cherrie Morage and Chicana Feminism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frug===
Although [[postmodernism]] resists characterization, it is possible to identify certain themes or orientations that postmodern feminists share. [[Mary Joe Frug]] suggested that one "principle" of postmodernism is that human experience is located "inescapably within language."  Power is exercised not only through direct coercion, but also through the way in which language shapes and restricts our reality. However, because language is always open to re-interpretation, it can also be used to resist this shaping and restriction, and so is a potentially fruitful site of political struggle. 

Frug's second postmodern principle is that sex is not something natural, nor is it something completely determinate and definable. Rather, sex is part of a system of meaning, produced by language. Frug argues that "cultural mechanisms ... encode the female body with meanings," and that these cultural mechanisms then go on explain these meanings "by an appeal to the 'natural' differences between the sexes, differences that the rules themselves help to produce."&lt;ref&gt;Mary Joe Frug, "A Postmodern Feminist Legal Manifesto (An Unfinished Draft)," ''Harvard Law Review'', Vol. 105, No. 5. (Mar., 1992), pp. 1045-1075, at p. 1049.&lt;/ref&gt; Rejecting the idea of a natural basis to sexual difference allows us to see that it is always susceptible to new interpretations. Like other systems of meaning, it is less like a cage, and more like a tool: it constrains but never completely determines what one can do with it.

===French feminism===
[[French feminism]] from the 1970s onwards has forged specific routes in postmodern feminism and in feminist [[psychoanalysis]], through such writers as [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Hélène Cixous]].

Cixous argued for a new form of writing, writing with the body - a kind of writing rooted not in biology but in liguistic change.&lt;ref&gt;Ermath, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Irigaray considered that "man would search, with nostalgia and repulsion, in woman for his own repressed and uncultivated natural pole" - something which would "prevent woman from truly being an other for him".&lt;ref&gt;Luce Irigaray, ''Sharing the World'' (2008) p. 33-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Kristeva argued that 'woman' does not exist, but is rather in a state of becoming.&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toril Moi]] has stressed that issues of [[Difference (philosophy)|difference]] as well as of femininity are central to the concerns of all the above writers.&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentz eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bornstein===
[[Kate Bornstein]], transgender author and playwright, calls herself a [[postmodernism|postmodern feminist]], which is not the same as a post-feminist.

==Criticism==

Critics like [[Meaghan Morris]] have argued that postmodern feminism runs the risk of undercutting the basis of a politics of action based upon gender difference, through its very anti-essentialism.&lt;ref&gt;K. Schmidt, ''The Theatre of Transformation'' (2005) p. 129-30&lt;/ref&gt;

“One of the most appealing aspects of postmodernism to many feminists has been its focus on difference. The notion that women have been created and defined as ‘other’ by men has long been argued and explored by feminists, most notably Simone de Beauvoir. She challenged male definitions of woman and called on women to define themselves outside the male female dyad. Women, she urged, must be the subject rather than the object (other) of analysis.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parpart|first=Jane|title=Who Is the ‘Other‘?: A Postmodern Feminist Critique of Women and Development Theory and Practice|journal=Development and Chance|date=22|year=2008|month=October|volume=24|issue=3|pages=439–464}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Feminist Moya Lloyd adds that a postmodernist femin.ism “does not necessarily represent a post-feminism, but alternatively, can affirm feminist politics in their plural, multivocal, fluid, oft-changing hue"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parpart|first=Jane|title=Who is the ‘Other‘?: A Postmodern Feminist Critique of Women and Development Theory and Practice|journal=Development and Change|date=22|year=2008|month=October|volume=24|issue=3|pages=439–464}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Post-structuralism is defined in the Penguin Reference, Dictionary of Literary Terms &amp; Literary Theory, as “Post-structuralism is a more rigorous working out of the possibilities, implications and shortcomings of structuralism and it’s basis to Saussurean linguistics itself…. Post-structuralism doubts the adequacy of structuralism and, as far as literature is concerned, tends to reveal that the meaning of any text is, of its nature, unstable. It reveals that signification is, of its nature, unstable.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuddon|first=J.A.|title=The Penguin dictionary of literary terms and literary theory|year=1998|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780140513639|pages=689–693|edition=4. ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

“Post-structuralism, pursues further the Saussurean perception that in language there are only differences without positive terms and shows that the signifier and signified are, as it were, not only oppositional, but plural, pulling against each other, and, by so doing, creating numerous deferments of meaning, apparently endless criss-crossing patterns in sequences of meaning. In short, what are called ‘disseminations.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuddon|first=J.A.|title=The Penguin dictionary of literary terms and literary theory|year=1998|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780140513639|pages=689–693|edition=4. ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
