{{about|sectarianism as conflict between groups|sectarianism as a characteristic of sects|sect}}
'''Sectarianism''' is a form of [[prejudice]], [[discrimination]], or [[hatred]] arising from attaching relations of inferiority and superiority to differences between subdivisions within a group. Common examples are [[Religious denomination|denomination]]s of a [[religion]], [[ethnic identity]], [[Social class|class]], or [[region]] for citizens of a state and [[Political faction|faction]]s of a [[political movement]].

The [[ideological]] underpinnings of attitudes and behaviours labelled as sectarian are extraordinarily varied. Members of a religious, national or political group may believe that their own salvation, or the success of their particular objectives, requires aggressively seeking converts from other groups; likewise, adherents of a given faction may believe that the achievement of their own political or religious goals requires the conversion or purging of dissidents within their own sect.

Sometimes a group that is under economic or political pressure will kill or attack members of another group which it regards as responsible for its own decline. It may also more rigidly define the definition of orthodox belief within its particular group or organization, and expel or excommunicate those who do not support this newfound clarified definition of political or religious [[orthodoxy]]. In other cases, dissenters from this orthodoxy will secede from the orthodox organization and proclaim themselves as practitioners of a reformed belief system, or holders of a perceived former orthodoxy. At other times, sectarianism may be the expression of a group's [[nationalist]]ic or cultural ambitions, or exploited by [[demagogue]]s.

The phrase "sectarian conflict" usually refers to violent conflict along religious or political lines such as the conflicts between [[Irish Nationalism|Nationalists]] and [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionists]] in [[Northern Ireland]] (religious and class-divisions may play major roles as well). It may also refer to general philosophical, political disparity between different schools of thought such as that between [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s. Non-sectarians espouse that free association and tolerance of different beliefs are the cornerstone to successful peaceful human interaction. They espouse political and religious [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]].

While sectarianism is often labelled as 'religious' and/ or 'political', the reality of a sectarian situation is usually much more complex.  In its most basic form sectarianism has been defined as, 'the existence, within a locality, of two or more divided and actively competing communal identities, resulting in a strong sense of dualism which unremittingly transcends commonality, and is both culturally and physically manifest.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Liverpool Sectarianism: The Rise and Demise|last=Roberts|first=Keith Daniel|publisher=Liverpool University Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1-78694-010-0|location=Liverpool|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sectarianization==

Various scholars have made a differentiation between "sectarianism" and "sectarianization". While the first describes prejudice, discrimination, and hatred between subdivisions within a group, e.g. based on their religious or ethnic identity, the latter describes how sectarianism is mobilized by political actors due to ulterior political motives.&lt;ref name=":blabla"&gt;Hashemi, Nader, and Danny Postel.

Qantara, October 17, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; While religious identity is salient in the Middle East and has contributed to and intensified conflicts across the region, it is the politicization and mobilization of popular sentiments around certain identity markers ("sectarianization") that explains the extent and upsurge of sectarian violence in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=":blabla" /&gt; The Ottoman [[Tanzimat]], [[colonialism|European colonialism]] and [[authoritarianism]] are key in the process of sectarianization in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=":blabla" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":blabla1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":blabla3"&gt;Makdisi, Ussama Samir.

===The Ottoman Tanzimat and European colonialism===

The Ottoman Tanzimat, a period of Ottoman reform (1839–1876), emerged from an effort to resist European intervention by emancipating the non-Muslim subjects of the empire, as European powers had started intervening in the region "on a explicitly sectarian basis".&lt;ref name=":blabla2" /&gt; The resulting growth of tensions and the conflicting interpretations of the Ottoman reform led to the 1840s sectarian violence in [[Mount Lebanon]] and the [[1860 Mount Lebanon civil war|massacres of 1860]]. This resulted in "a system of local administration and politics explicitly defined on a narrow communal basis".&lt;ref name=":blabla2" /&gt; Sectarianism arose from the confrontation between European colonialism and the [[Ottoman Empire]] and was used to mobilize religious identities for political and social purposes.&lt;ref name=":blabla3" /&gt;

In the decades that followed, a colonial strategy and technique to assert control and perpetuate power used by the [[France|French]] during their [[Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|mandate rule of Lebanon]] was [[divide and rule]].&lt;ref name=":blabla1" /&gt; The establishment of the [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Ja'fari court]] in 1926, facilitated by the French as a "quasi-colonial institution"&lt;ref name=":blabla1" /&gt;, provided Shi'a Muslims with sectarian rights through the [[institutionalization]] of [[Shia Islam]], and hence gave rise to political Shi’ism. The "variation in the institutionalization of [[welfare|social welfare]] across different sectarian communities forged and exacerbated social disparities".&lt;ref&gt;Cammett, Melani. [https://books.google.de/books?id=Nb1fAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=variation+in+the+institutionalization+of+social+welfare+across+different+sectarian+communities+forged+and+exacerbated+social+disparities&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=giQZXeivHi&amp;sig=ACfU3U0N8iEEqX5CrJz2HQfxHOSIX1W40w&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiIubTIrsXpAhXP-KQKHa7_ArEQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=variation%20in%20the%20institutionalization%20of%20social%20welfare%20across%20different%20sectarian%20communities%20forged%20and%20exacerbated%20social%20disparities&amp;f=false ''Compassionate Communalism: Welfare and Sectarianism in Lebanon''.] Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 2014. p. 40. {{ISBN|978-0-8014-5232-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, with the [[standardization]], [[Codification (law)|codification]] and [[bureaucratization]] of Shia Islam, a Shi’i [[collective identity]] began to form and the Shi’i community started to "practice" sectarianism.&lt;ref name=":blabla1" /&gt; "The French colonial state contributed to rendering the Shi‘i community in [[Jabal Amel|Jabal ‘Amil]] and [[Beirut]] more visible, more empowered, but also more sectarian, in ways that it had never quite been before."&lt;ref name=":blabla1" /&gt; This fundamental transformation, or process of sectarianization, led by the French created a new political reality that paved the way for the "mobilization" and "radicalization" of the Shi’a community during the [[Lebanese civil war]].&lt;ref name=":blabla1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henley, Alexander D. M. [http://www.brismes.ac.uk/nmes/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/NMES2011RevHenley.pdf "Review of Max Weiss, ''In the Shadow of Sectarianism: Law, Shiʿism and the Making of Modern Lebanon''."] ''New Middle Eastern Studies'', 1 (2011). p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
===Authoritarian regimes===

In recent years, authoritarian regimes have been particularly prone to sectarianization. This is because their key strategy of survival lies in manipulating sectarian identities to deflect demands for change and [[justice]] and preserve and perpetuate their power.&lt;ref name=":blabla" /&gt; Christian communities, and other religious and ethnic minorities in the Middle East, have been socially, economically and politically excluded and harmed primarily by regimes that focus on "securing power and manipulating their base by appeals to [[Arab nationalism]] and/or to [[Islam]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Kail C. "Epilogue." In [https://books.google.de/books?id=e7RGDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA211&amp;lpg=PA211&amp;dq=authoritarianism+and+sectarianization&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zz2OtghdTC&amp;sig=ACfU3U1f1yJPvcvVJcPw_1FDQABN9FfuGg&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwib-qP5gsXpAhUD-qQKHTgQBnMQ6AEwAnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=authoritarianism%20and%20sectarianization&amp;f=false ''Secular Nationalism and Citizenship in Muslim Countries: Arab Christians in Muslim Countries''], edited by Kail C. Ellis. London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2018. p. 211. {{ISBN|978-3-319-71203-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the Middle Eastern regional response to the [[Iranian revolution]] of 1979. Middle Eastern dictatorships backed by the [[United States]], especially [[Saudi Arabia]], feared that the spread of the revolutionary spirit and ideology would affect their power and dominance in the region. Therefore, efforts were made to undermine the Iranian revolution by labeling it as a Shi’a conspiracy to corrupt the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Islamic tradition]]. This was followed by a rise of [[anti-Shi'ism|anti-Shi’a sentiments]] across the region and a deterioration of [[Shi'a-Sunni relations]], impelled by funds from the Gulf states.&lt;ref name=":blabla" /&gt; Therefore, the process of sectarianization, the mobilization and politicization of sectarian identities, is a political tool for authoritarian regimes to perpetuate their power and justify violence.&lt;ref name=":blabla" /&gt; Western powers indirectly take part in the process of sectarianization by supporting undemocratic regimes in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=":blabla4" /&gt; As Nader Hashemi asserts:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The U.S. invasion of Iraq; the support of various Western governments for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which commits war crime upon war crime in [[Yemen]] and disseminates poisonous sectarian [[propaganda]] throughout the Sunni world; not to mention longstanding Western support for highly repressive dictators who manipulate sectarian fears and anxieties as a strategy of control and regime survival – the "ancient hatreds" narrative [between Sunnis and Shi’as] washes this all away and lays the blame for the regionʹs problems on supposedly trans-historical religious passions. Itʹs absurd in the extreme and an exercise in bad faith.&lt;ref name=":blabla4" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Religious sectarianism==
[[File:Orange Riot 1871 crop.jpg|thumb|right|250px|In 1871, New York's [[Orange Riots]] were incited by Irish Protestants. 63 citizens, mostly Irish Catholics, were massacred in the resulting police-action.]]
Wherever people of different religions live in close proximity to each other, religious sectarianism can often be found in varying forms and degrees. In some areas, religious sectarians (for example Protestant and Catholic [[Christians]]) {{as of | 2010 | alt = now}} exist peacefully side by side for the most part, although these differences have resulted in violence, death, and outright warfare as recently as the 1990s. Probably the best-known example in recent times were [[The Troubles]].

Catholic-Protestant sectarianism has also been a factor in U.S. presidential campaigns. Prior to [[John F. Kennedy]], only one Catholic ([[Al Smith]]) had ever been a major party presidential nominee, and he had been solidly defeated largely because of claims based on his Catholicism. JFK chose to tackle the sectarian issue head-on during the West Virginia primary, but that only sufficed to win him barely enough Protestant votes to eventually win the presidency by one of the narrowest margins ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/JFK-in-History/JFK-and-Religion.aspx|title=John F. Kennedy and Religion|access-date=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[Islam]], there has been conflict at various periods between [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]] and [[Shia Islam|Shias]];  Shi'ites consider Sunnis to be damned, due to their refusal to accept the first Caliph as [[Ali]] and accept all following descendants of him as infallible and divinely guided. Many Sunni religious leaders, including those inspired by [[Wahhabism]] and other ideologies have declared Shias to be [[Heresy|heretics]] or [[Apostasy|apostates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7181042.stm | work=BBC News | title=Lahore bomb raises sectarian questions | date=January 10, 2008 | access-date=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long before the Reformation, dating back to the 12th century, there has been sectarian conflict of varying intensity in Ireland. This sectarianism is connected to a degree with [[nationalism]]. This has been particularly intense in Northern Ireland since the early 17th century [[plantation of Ulster]] under James I, with its religious and denominational sectarian tensions lasting to the present day in some forms. This has translated to parts of [[Great Britain]], most notably [[Liverpool]], and the West Central Scotland, the latter being very close geographically to Northern Ireland, and where some fans of the two best-known football clubs, [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] (long been affiliated with Catholics) and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] (long affiliated with Protestants), indulge in provocative and [[Sectarianism in Glasgow|sectarian behaviour]].

Historically, some Catholic countries once persecuted Protestants as heretics. For example, the substantial Protestant population of France (the [[Huguenot]]s) was expelled from the kingdom in the 1680s following the [[revocation of the Edict of Nantes]]. In Spain, the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] sought to root out [[Marrano|crypto-Jews]] but also [[Morisco|crypto-Muslims]] (''[[expulsion of the Moriscos|moriscos]]''); elsewhere the [[Inquisition|Papal Inquisition]] held similar goals.

In most places where Protestantism is the majority or "official" religion, there have been examples of Catholics being persecuted.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In countries where the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was successful, this often lay in the perception that Catholics retained allegiance to a 'foreign' power ([[the Papacy]] or [[Holy See|the Vatican]]), causing them to be regarded with suspicion. Sometimes this mistrust manifested itself in Catholics being subjected to restrictions and discrimination, which itself led to further conflict. For example, before [[Catholic Emancipation]] was introduced with the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]], Catholics were forbidden from voting, becoming MP's or buying land in Ireland.

Ireland was deeply scarred by religious sectarianism following the [[Protestant Reformation]] as tensions between the native Catholic Irish and Protestant settlers from Britain led to massacres and attempts at ethnic cleaning by both sides during the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]], [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]], [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] and the [[Home Rule Crisis]] of 1912. The invasion of Ireland by English parliamentarian forces under [[Oliver Cromwell]] in 1659 was notoriously brutal and witnessed the widespread [[ethnic cleansing]] of the native Irish. The failure of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|Rebellion of 1798]], which sought to unite Protestants and Catholics for an independent Ireland, helped cause more sectarian violence in the island, most infamously the [[Scullabogue Barn massacre]], in which Protestants were burned alive in [[County Wexford]]. The British response, which included the public executions of dozens of suspected rebels in [[Dunlavin Green executions|Dunlavin]] and [[Carnew executions|Carnew]], along with other violence perpetrated by all sides, ended the hope that Protestants and Catholics could work together for Ireland.

After the [[Partition of Ireland]] in 1922, [[Northern Ireland]] witnessed decades of intensified conflict, tension, and sporadic violence between the dominant Protestant majority and the Catholic minority, which in 1969 finally erupted into 25 years of violence known as “[[The Troubles]]” between [[Irish Republicans]] whose goal is a [[United Ireland]] and Ulster loyalists who wish for Northern Ireland to remain a part of the United Kingdom. The conflict was primarily fought over the existence of the Northern Irish state rather than religion, though sectarian relations within Northern Ireland fueled the conflict. However, religion is commonly used as a marker to differentiate the two sides of the community. The Catholic minority primarily favour the nationalist, and to some degree, republican, goal of unity with the [[Republic of Ireland]], while the Protestant majority favour Northern Ireland continuing the union with Great Britain.

The civil wars in the [[Balkans]] which followed the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] in the 1990s have been heavily tinged with sectarianism. [[Croats]] and [[Slovenes]] have traditionally been Catholic, [[Serbs]] and [[Macedonian Slavs|Macedonians]] [[Eastern Orthodox]], and [[Bosniaks]] and most [[Albanians]] Muslim. Religious affiliation served as a marker of group identity in this conflict, despite relatively low rates of religious practice and belief among these various groups after decades of [[communism]].

Sectarianism in Australia was a historical legacy from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, between Catholics of mainly Celtic heritage and Protestants of mainly English descent. It has largely disappeared in the 21st century. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, religious tensions are more centered on Muslim immigrants amid the backdrop of Salafist or Islamist terrorism.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

====Sri Lanka====
Most Muslims in Sri Lanka are Sunnis. There are a few Shia Muslims too from the relatively small trading community of Bohras. Divisiveness is not a new phenomenon to Beruwala. Sunni Muslims in the Kalutara district are split in two different sub groups. One group, known as the Alaviya sect, historically holds its annual feast at the Ketchimalai mosque located on the palm-fringed promontory adjoining the fisheries harbour in Beruwala.

It is a microcosm of the Muslim identity in many ways. The Galle Road that hugs the coast from Colombo veers inland just ahead of the town and forms the divide. On the left of the road lies China Fort, the area where some of the wealthiest among Sri Lankans Muslims live. The palatial houses with all modern conveniences could outdo if not equal those in the Colombo 7 sector. Most of the wealthy Muslims, gem dealers, even have a home in the capital, not to mention property.

Strict Wahabis believe that all those who do not practise their form of religion are heathens and enemies. There are others who say Wahabism's rigidity has led it to misinterpret and distort Islam, pointing to the Taliban as well as Osama bin Laden. What has caused concern in intelligence and security circles is the manifestation of this new phenomenon in Beruwala. It had earlier seen its emergence in the east.

==== Iran ====

===== Overview =====

Sectarianism in Iran has been existing for centuries, dating back to the [[Islam in Iran|Islamic conquer]] of the country in early Islamic years and continued throughout the Iranian history upon now. During the [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|Safavid Dynasty's reign ]] sectarianism started to play an important role in shaping the path of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khalaji |first1=Mehdi |title=Iran's Regime of Religion |journal=Journal of International Affairs |date=September 1, 2001 |volume=65 |issue=1 |page=131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Safavid rule between 1501 and 1722, [[Shiism]] started to evolve and became established as the official state religion, leading to the creation of the first religiously legitimate government since the occultation of the [[Hujjat-Allah al-Mahdi|Twelfth imam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khalaji |first1=Mehdi |title=Iran's Regime of Religion |journal=Journal of International Affairs |date=September 1, 2001 |volume=65 |issue=1 |page=134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern of sectarianism prevailed throughout the Iranian history. The approach that sectarianism has taken after the Iranian 1979 revolution is shifted compared to the earlier periods. Never before the Iranian 1979 revolution did the Shiite leadership gain as much authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mishal |first1=Shaul |title=Understanding Shiite Leadership: the Art of the Middle Ground in Iran and Lebanon. |date=March 5, 2015 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1107632677 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this change, the sectarian timeline in Iran can be divided in pre- and post-Iranian 1979 revolution where the religious leadership changed course.

Shiism has been an important factor in shaping the politics, culture and religion within Iran, long before the Iranian 1979 revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khalaji |first1=Mehdi |title=Iran's Regime of Religion |journal=Journal of International Affairs |date=September 1, 2001 |volume=65 |issue=1 |page=131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;During the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Dynasty]] Shiism was established as the official ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khalaji |first1=Mehdi |title=Iran's Regime of Religion |journal=Journal of International Affairs |date=September 1, 2001 |volume=65 |issue=1 |page=131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of Shiism as an official government ideology opened the doors for clergies to benefit from new cultural, political and religious rights which were denied prior to the Safavid ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khalaji |first1=Mehdi |title=Iran's Regime of Religion |journal=Journal of International Affairs |date=September 1, 2001 |volume=65 |issue=1 |page=131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Dynasty]] Shiism was established as the official ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khalaji |first1=Mehdi |title=Iran's Regime of Religion |journal=Journal of International Affairs |date=September 1, 2001 |volume=65 |issue=1 |page=131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Safavid rule allowed greater freedom for religious leaders. By establishing Shiism as the state religion, they legitimised the religious authority. After this power establishment, religious leaders started to play a crucial role within the political system but remained socially and economically independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Abisaab |first1=Rula |title=Converting Persia: religion and power in the Safavid Empire |date=26 February 2004 |publisher=I.B. Tauris |isbn=186064970X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The monarchial power balance during the Safavid ere changed every few years, resulting in a changing limit of power of the clergies. The tensions concerning power relations of the religious authorities and the ruling power eventually played a pivotal role in the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution|1906 constitutional revolution]] which limited the power of the monarch, and increased the power of religious leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bayat |first1=Mangol |title=Iran's first revolution : Shi'ism and the constitutional revolution of 1905-1909 |year=1991 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-506822-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1906 constitutional revolution involved both constitutionalist and anti-constitutionalist clergy leaders. Individuals such as [[Sayyid Jamal al-Din Va'iz]] were constitutionalist clergies whereas other clergies such as [[Mohammed Kazem Yazdi]] were considered anti-constitutionalist. The establishment of a Shiite government during the Safavid rule resulted in the increase of power within this religious sect. The religious power establishment increased throughout the years and resulted in fundamental changes within the Iranian society in the twentieth century,  eventually leading to the establishment of the Shiite Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979.

===== Post-1979 Revolution: Islamic Republic of Iran =====

[[Iranian Revolution|The Iranian 1979 revolution]] led to the overthrow of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] and the establishment of the [[Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran |Islamic Government of Iran]]. The governing body of Iran displays clear elements of sectarianism which are visible within different layers of its system.
The 1979 revolution led to changes in political system, leading to the establishment of a bureaucratic clergy-regime which has created its own interpretation of the [[Shia Islam| Shia sect]] in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khalaji |first1=Mehdi |title=Iran's Regime of Religion |journal=Journal of International Affairs |date=September 1, 2001 |volume=65 |issue=1 |page=131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;Religious differentiation is often used by authoritarian regimes to express hostility towards other groups such as ethnic minorities and political opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grabowski |first1=Wojciech |title=Sectarianism as a Factor Shaping Persian Gulf Security |journal=International Studies |date=2017 |volume=52 |issue=1–4 |page=1 |doi=10.1177/0020881717715550 |s2cid=158923334 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/home/isq}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authoritarian regimes can use religion as a weapon to create an ''  "us and them" '' paradigm. This leads to hostility amongst the involved parties and takes place internally but also externally. A valid example is the suppression of religious minorities like the Sunnis and [[Baháʼí Faith|Baha-ís]]. With the establishment of [[the Islamic Republic of Iran]] sectarian discourses arose in the Middle-East as the Iranian religious regime has attempted and in some cases succeeded to spread its religious and political ideas in the region. These sectarian labeled issues are politically charged. The most notable Religious leaders in Iran are named ''Supreme-leaders.'' Their role has proved to be pivotal in the evolvement of sectarianism within the country and in the region. The following part discusses Iran's supreme-leadership in further detail.

===== Ruhollah Khomeini and Ali Khamenei =====

During the Iran-Iraq war, Iran's first supreme-leader, [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] called for the participation of all Iranians in the war. His usage of [[Martyrdom in Iran|Shia martyrdom]] led to the creation of a national consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Abedin |first1=Mahan |title=Iran Resurgent: The Rise and Rise of the Shia State |date=July 15, 2015 |publisher=C. Hurst and Company (Publishers) Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early aftermath of the Iranian 1979 revolution, Khomeini started to evolve a sectarian tone in his speeches.  His focus on Shiism and Shia Islam grew which was also implemented within the changing policies of the country.  In one of his speeches Khomeini quoted: "the Path to Jerusalem passes through Karbala." His phrase lead to many different interpretations, leading to turmoil in the region but also within the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Abedin |first1=Mahan |title=Iran Resurgent: The Rise and Rise of the Shia State |date=July 15, 2015 |publisher=C. Hurst and Company (Publishers) Limited |page=24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From a religious historic viewpoint, [[Karbala]] and [[Najaf]] which are both situated in Iraq, serve as important sites for Shia Muslims around the world. By mentioning these two cities, Khomeini led to the creation of Shia expansionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Abedin |first1=Mahan |title=Iran Resurgent : The Rise and Rise of the Shia State |date=July 15, 2015 |publisher=C. Hurst and Company (Publishers) Limited |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Khomeini's war with the [[Iraqi Bath Regime]] had many underlying reasons and sectarianism can be considered as one of the main reasons. The tensions between Iran and Iraq are of course not only sectarian related, but religion is often a weapon used by the Iranian regime to justify its actions. Khomeini's words also resonated in other Arab countries who had been fighting for [[Palestine-Israel conflict|Palestinian liberation against Israel.]] By naming Jerusalem, Khomeini expressed his desire for liberating Palestine from the hands of what he later often has named [[Iran Israel relations|"the enemy of Islam."]] Iran has supported rebellious groups throughout the region. Its support for Hamas and Hezbollah has resulted in international condemnation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Profile: Lebanon's Hezbollah |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-10814698 |work=BBC News |date=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
This desire for Shia expansionism did not disappear after Khomeini's death. It can even be argued that sectarian tone within the Islamic Republic of Iran has grown since then. 
The Friday prayers held in Tehran by Ali Khamenei can be seen as a proof of growing sectarian tone within the regime. Khamenei's speeches are extremely political and sectarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Khamenei: Iran not calling for elimination of Jews, wants non-sectarian Israel |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-iran-khamenei/khamenei-iran-not-calling-for-elimination-of-jews-wants-non-sectarian-israel-idUSKBN1XP0WP |access-date= May 8, 2020 |work= Reuters |date=November 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often mentions extreme wishes such as the removal of Israel from the world map and fatwas directed towards those opposing the regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pileggi |first1=Tamar |title=Khamenei: Israel a 'cancerous tumor' that 'must be eradicated' |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/khamenei-israel-a-cancerous-tumor-that-must-be-eradicated/ |work=www.timesofisrael.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Regional tensions and Iran's role =====

The political approach that the Islamic Republic of Iran has taken in the previous decades has led to the increase of tensions in the region. World leaders from around the world have criticised the political ambitions of Iran and have condemned its involvement and support for opposition groups such as [[Hezbollah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Phillips |first1=Christopher |title=The battle for Syria: international rivalry in the new Middle East |date=October 25, 2016 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9780300217179 |page=158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By using religion as an instrument, Iran has expanded its authority to neighbouring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Phillips |first1=Christopher |title=The battle for Syria : international rivalry in the new Middle East |date=October 25, 2016 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9780300217179 |page=158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An important figure in this process of power and ideology expansion was the major general of Iran's [[Quds Force]], the foreign arm of the [[Irgc|IRGC]], [[Qasem Soleimani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Who was Qassem Soleimani, Iran's IRGC's Quds Force leader? |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/qassem-soleimani-iran-elite-quds-force-leader-200103033905377.html |work=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soleimani was assassinated in Iraq by an American drone in January 2020 leading to an increase of tension between the [[United States|United States of America]] and Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Top Iranian general killed by US in Iraq |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50979463 |work=BBC News |date=3 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soleimani was responsible for strengthening Iran's ties with foreign powers such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, Syria's al-Assad and Shia militia groups in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Top Iranian general killed by US in Iraq |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50979463 |work=BBC News |date=3 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soleimani was seen as the number-one commander of Iran's foreign troops and played a crucial role in the spread of Iran's ideology in the region. According to President [[Donald Trump]], Soleimani was the world's most wanted terrorist and had to be assassinated in order to bring more peace to the Middle-East region but also the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Remarks by President Trump on the Killing of Qasem Soleimani |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-killing-qasem-soleimani/ |website=The White House}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Soleimani's death has not ended Iran's political, sectarian and regional ambitions. Iran remains a key power in expending ideologies to its neighbouring countries. Shiism is used by the regime to justify its actions. But it can be concluded that Iran's usage of religion is an excuse to spread its political power regionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Iran's Use of Religion as a Tool in its Foreign Policy |url=http://www.us-iran.org/news/2018/5/1/irans-use-of-religion-as-a-tool-in-its-foreign-policy |website=American Iranian Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Iraq====
{{See also|Civil war in Iraq (2006-07)}}
Sunni [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgency]] and foreign Sunni terrorist organizations who came to Iraq after the fall of [[Saddam Hussein]] have targeted Shia civilians in sectarian attacks. Following the civil war, the Sunnis have complained of discrimination by Iraq's Shia majority governments, which is bolstered by the news that Sunni detainees were allegedly discovered to have been [[torture]]d in a compound used by government forces on November 15, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The Shia majority oppression by the Sunni minority has a long history in Iraq, after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the British imposed upon Iraq a rule of Sunni Hashemite monarchy that suppressed various uprisings against its rule by the Christian Assyrians, Kurds, Yazidis and Shi'ites. After the monarchy was overthrown, Iraq was ruled by the de jure secular [[Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-dominated faction)|Baathist]] Party, while de facto a minority Sunni absolute rule that discriminated against and persecuted the Shia majority.

====Syria====
{{See also|Sectarianism and minorities in the Syrian civil war}}Although sectarianism has been described as one of the characteristic features of the [[Syrian civil war]], the narrative of sectarianism already had its origins in Syria's past. 

===== Ottoman rule =====
[[File:Wounded civilians arrive at hospital Aleppo.jpg|thumb|Wounded civilians arrive at a hospital in Aleppo]]The hostilities that took place in [[Massacre of Aleppo (1850)|1850]] in [[Aleppo]] and subsequently in 1860 in [[Damascus]], had many causes and reflected long-standing tensions. However, scholars have claimed that the eruptions of violence can also be partly attributed to the modernizing reforms, the [[Tanzimat]], taking place within the [[Ottoman Empire]], who had been ruling Syria since 1516.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sahner|first=Christian C.|title=Among the Ruins: Syria Past and Present|publisher=Hurst &amp; Company|year=2014|isbn=9781849044004|location=London|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Christopher|date=1 February 2015|title=Sectarianism and Conflict in Syria|journal=Third World Quarterly|volume=36|issue=2|pages=364|doi=10.1080/01436597.2015.1015788|s2cid=144558644}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tanzimat bring about equality between [[Muslims]] and non-Muslims living in the Ottoman Empire. This caused the non-Muslims to gain privileges and influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fawaz|first=Leila Tarazi|title=An Occasion for War: Civil Conflict in Lebanon and Damascus in 1860|publisher=I.B. Tauris|year=1994|isbn=1850432015|location=London|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this growing position of non-Muslims through the Tanzimat reforms, the influence of European powers also came mainly to the benefit of the [[Christians]], [[Druze|Druzes]] and [[Judaism|Jews]]. In the silk trade business, European powers formed ties with local sects. They usually opted for a sect that adhered to a religion similar to the one in their home countries, thus not Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fawaz|first=Leila Tarazi|title=An Occasion for War: Civil Conflict in Lebanon and Damascus in 1860|publisher=I.B. Tauris|year=1994|isbn=1850432015|location=London|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These developments caused new social classes to emerge, consisting of mainly Christians, Druzes and Jews. These social classes stripped the previously existing Muslim classes of their privileges. The involvement of another foreign power, though this time non-European, also had its influence on communal relations in Syria. [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt]] ruled Syria between 1831 and 1840. His divide-and-rule strategy contributed to the hostilities between the Druze and [[Maronites|Maronite]] community, by arming the Maronite Christians. However, it is noteworthy to mention that different sects did not fight the others out of religious motives, nor did Ibrahim Pasha aim to disrupt society among communal lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Makdisi|first=Ussama Samir|title=The Culture of Sectarianism: Community, History, and Violence in Nineteenth-Century Ottoman Lebanon|publisher=University of California Press|year=2000|isbn=0-520-21845-0|location=London|pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can also be illustrated by the unification of Druzes and Maronites in their revolts to oust Ibrahim Pasha in 1840. This goes to show the fluidity of communal alliances and animosities and the different, at times non-religious, reasons that may underline sectarianism. 

===== After Ottoman rule =====
Before the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the [[Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French Mandate]] in Syria, the Syrian territory had already witnessed massacres on the Maronite Christians, other Christians, [[Alawites]], [[Shia Islam|Shias]] and [[Isma'ilism|Ismailiyas]], which had resulted in distrustful sentiments between the members of different sects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tomass|first=Mark|title=The Religious Roots of the Syrian Conflict: The Remaking of the Fertile Crescent|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2016|isbn=978-1-137-53149-0|location=London|pages=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to protect the minority communities against the majority Sunni population, [[France]], with the command of [[Henri Gouraud (general)|Henri Gouraud]], created five states for the following sects: [[Armenians]], Alawites, Druzes, Maronite Christians and Sunni Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tomass|first=Mark|title=The Religious Roots of the Syrian Conflict: The Remaking of the Fertile Crescent|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2016|isbn=978-1-137-53149-0|location=London|pages=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; This focus on minorities was new and part of a divide-and-rule strategy of the French, which enhanced and politicized differences between sects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Christopher|date=1 February 2015|title=Sectarianism and Conflict in Syria|journal=Third World Quarterly|volume=36|issue=2|pages=364|doi=10.1080/01436597.2015.1015788|s2cid=144558644}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restructuring by the French caused the Alawite community to advance itself from their marginalized position. In addition to that, the Alawites were also able to obtain a position of power through granting top level positions to family members of the ruling clan or other tribal allies of the Alawite community.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wehrey|first=Frederic|title=Beyond Sunni and Shia: The Roots of Sectarianism in a Changing Middle East|publisher=Hurst &amp; Company|year=2017|isbn=9781849048149|location=London|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period 1961–1980, Syria was not necessarily exclusively ruled by the Alawite sect, but due to efforts of the Sunni Muslim extremist opponents of the Ba’th regime in Syria, it was perceived as such. The [[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-dominated faction)|Ba’ath]] regime was being dominated by the Alawite community, as well as were other institutions of power.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite book|last=van Dam|first=Nikolaos|title=The Struggle for Power in Syria: Sectarianism, Regionalism and Tribalism in Politics, 1961-1980|publisher=Croom Helm|year=1981|isbn=0-7099-2601-4|location=London|pages=111–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, the regime was considered to be sectarian, which caused the Alawite community to cluster together, as they feared for their position.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; This period is actually contradictory as [[Hafez al-Assad]] tried to create a Syrian [[Arab nationalism]], but the regime was still regarded as sectarian and sectarian identities were reproduced and politicized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Christopher|date=1 February 2015|title=Sectarianism and Conflict in Syria|journal=Third World Quarterly|volume=36|issue=2|pages=366|doi=10.1080/01436597.2015.1015788|s2cid=144558644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sectarian tensions that later gave rise to the Syrian civil war, had already appeared in society due to events preceding 1970. For example, President Hafez al-Assad's involvement in the [[Lebanese Civil War|Lebanese civil war]] by giving political aid to Maronite Christians in [[Lebanon]]. This was viewed by many Sunny Muslims as an act of treason, which made them link al-Assad's actions to his Alawite identity.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tomass|first=Mark|title=The Religious Roots of the Syrian Conflict: The Remaking of the Fertile Crescent|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2016|isbn=978-1-137-53149-0|location=London|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Muslim Brotherhood of Syria|Muslim Brothers]], a part of the Sunni Muslims, used those tensions towards the Alawites as a tool to boost their political agenda and plans.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Several assassinations were carried out by the Muslim Brothers, mostly against Alawites, but also against some Sunni Muslims. The failed assassination attempt on President Hafez al-Assad is arguably the most well-known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tomass|first=Mark|title=The Religious Roots of the Syrian Conflict: The Remaking of the Fertile Crescent|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2016|isbn=978-1-137-53149-0|location=London|pages=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the animosity between the Alawites and the Sunni Islamists of the Muslim Brothers is due to the [[secularization]] of Syria, which the later holds the Alawites in power to be responsible for. 

===== Syrian Civil War =====
As of 2015, the majority of the Syrian population consisted of Sunni Muslims, namely two-thirds of the population, which can be found throughout the country. The Alawites are the second largest group, which make up around 10 percent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Christopher|date=1 February 2015|title=Sectarianism and Conflict in Syria|journal=Third World Quarterly|volume=36|issue=2|pages=357–376|doi=10.1080/01436597.2015.1015788|s2cid=144558644}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes them a ruling minority. The Alawites were originally settled in the highlands of Northwest Syria, but since the twentieth century have spread to places like [[Latakia]], [[Homs]] and Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sahner|first=Christian C.|title=Among the Ruins: Syria Past and Present|publisher=Hurst &amp; Company|year=2014|isbn=9781849044004|location=London|pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other groups that can be found in Syria are Christians, among which the Maronite Christians, Druzes and Twelver Shias. Although sectarian identities played a role in the unfolding of events of the Syrian Civil War, the importance of tribal and kinship relationships should not be underestimated, as they can be used to obtain and maintain power and loyalty.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

At the start of the protests against President [[Bashar al-Assad|Basher al-Assad]] in March 2011, there was no sectarian nature or approach involved. The opposition had national, inclusive goals and spoke in the name of a collective Syria, although the protesters being mainly Sunni Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Christopher|date=1 February 2015|title=Sectarianism and Conflict in Syria|journal=Third World Quarterly|volume=36|issue=2|pages=359|doi=10.1080/01436597.2015.1015788|s2cid=144558644}}&lt;/ref&gt; This changed after the protests and the following civil war began to be portrayed in sectarian terms by the regime, as a result of which people started to mobilize along ethnic lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wehrey|first=Frederic|title=Beyond Sunni and Shia: The Roots of Sectarianism in a Changing Middle East|publisher=Hurst &amp; Company|year=2017|isbn=9781849048149|location=London|pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not mean that the conflict is solely or primarily a sectarian conflict, as there were also socio-economic factors at play. These socio-economic factors were mainly the result of Basher al-Assad's mismanaged economic restructuring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wehrey|first=Frederic|title=Beyond Sunni and Shia: The Roots of Sectarianism in a Changing Middle East|publisher=Hurst &amp; Company|year=2017|isbn=9781849048149|location=London|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict has therefore been described as being semi-sectarian, making sectarianism a factor at play in the civil war, but certainly does not stand alone in causing the war and has varied in importance throughout time and place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Christopher|date=1 February 2015|title=Sectarianism and Conflict in Syria|journal=Third World Quarterly|volume=36|issue=2|pages=358|doi=10.1080/01436597.2015.1015788|s2cid=144558644}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to local forces, the role of external actors in the conflict in general as well as the sectarian aspect of the conflict should not be overlooked. Although foreign regimes were first in support of the [[Free Syrian Army]], they eventually ended up supporting sectarian militias with money and arms. However, it has to be said that their sectarian nature did not only attract these flows of support, but they also adopted a more sectarian and Islamic appearance in order to attract this support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Christopher|date=1 February 2015|title=Sectarianism and Conflict in Syria|journal=Third World Quarterly|volume=36|issue=2|pages=370|doi=10.1080/01436597.2015.1015788|s2cid=144558644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lebanon====

=====Overview=====
Sectarianism in Lebanon has been formalized and legalized within state and non-state institutions and is inscribed in its constitution. The foundations of sectarianism in Lebanon date back to the mid-19th century during Ottoman rule. It was subsequently reinforced with the creation of the Republic of Lebanon in 1920 and its 1926 constitution, and in the National Pact of 1943. In 1990, with the Taif Agreement, the constitution was revised but did not structurally change aspects relating to political sectarianism.&lt;ref name=Bahout&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bahout|first=Joseph|title=Sectarianism in Lebanon and Syria: The Dynamics of Mutual Spill-Over|journal=United States Institute of Peace|date=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dynamic nature of sectarianism in Lebanon has prompted some historians and authors to refer to it as "the sectarian state ''par excellence''" because it is an amalgam of religious communities and their myriad sub-divisions, with a constitutional and political order to match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hirst|first=David|title=Beware of Small States: Lebanon, Battleground of the Middle East|year=2011|publisher=Nation Books|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Historical background=====
According to various historians, sectarianism in Lebanon is not simply an inherent phenomena between the various religious communities there. Rather, historians have argued that the origins of sectarianism lay at the "intersection of nineteenth-century European colonialism and Ottoman modernization".&lt;ref name=Makdisi&gt;{{cite book|last=Makdisi|first=Ussama|title=The Culture of Sectarianism: Community, History, and Violence in Nineteenth-Century Ottoman Lebanon|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symbiosis of Ottoman modernization (through a variety of reforms) and indigenous traditions and practices became paramount in reshaping the political self-definition of each community along religious lines. The Ottoman reform movement launched in 1839 and the growing European presence in the Middle East subsequently led to the disintegration of the traditional Lebanese social order based on a hierarchy that bridged religious differences. Nineteenth-century Mount Lebanon was host to [[1860 Mount Lebanon civil war|competing armies and ideologies]] and for "totally contradictory interpretations of the meaning of reform" (i.e. Ottoman or European).&lt;ref name=Makdisi-a&gt;{{cite book|last=Makdisi|first=Ussama|title=The Culture of Sectarianism: Community, History, and Violence in Nineteenth-Century Ottoman Lebanon|year=2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8F5f1kjEVOEC|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=11|isbn=9780520922792}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fluidity over reform created the necessary conditions for sectarianism to rise as a "reflection of fractured identities" pulled between enticements and coercions of Ottoman and European power.&lt;ref name=Makdisi/&gt;  As such, the Lebanese encounter with European colonization altered the meaning of religion in the multi-confessional society because it "emphasized sectarian identity as the only viable marker of political reform and the only authentic basis for political claims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Makdisi|first=Ussama|title=The Culture of Sectarianism: Community, History, and Violence in Nineteenth-Century Ottoman Lebanon|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, during both Ottoman rule and later during the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French Mandate]], religious identities were deliberately mobilized for political and social reasons.

=====The Lebanese political system=====
Lebanon gained independence on 22 November 1943. Shortly thereafter, the National Pact was agreed upon and established the political foundations of modern Lebanon and laid the foundations of a sectarian power-sharing system (also known as confessionalism) based on the 1932 census.&lt;ref name=Salamey/&gt; The 1932 census is the only official census conducted in Lebanon: with a total population of 1,046,164 persons, Maronites made up 33.57%, Sunnis made up 18.57% and Shiites made up 15.92% (with several other denominations making up the remainder). The National Pact served to reinforce the sectarian system that had begun under the French Mandate, by formalizing the confessional distribution of the highest public offices and top administrative ranks according to the proportional distribution of the dominant sects within the population.&lt;ref name=Rogan&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Eugene|title=The Arabs: A History|date=2009|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the census showed a slight Christian dominance over Muslims, seats in the Chamber of Deputies (parliament) were distributed by a six-to-five ratio favoring Christians over Muslims. This ratio was to be applied to all highest-level public and administrative offices, such as ministers and directors. Furthermore, it was agreed that the President of the Republic would be a Maronite Christian; the Premier of the Council of Ministers would be a Sunni Muslim; the President of the National Assembly would be a Shiite Muslim; and the Deputy Speaker of Parliament a Greek Orthodox Christian.&lt;ref name=Salamey/&gt;

=====The Lebanese Civil War, 1975–1990=====
{{main|Lebanese Civil War}}
During the three decades following independence from the French Mandate, "various internal tensions inherent to the Lebanese system and multiple regional developments collectively contributed to the breakdown of governmental authority and the outbreak of civil strife in 1975”.&lt;ref name=Salamey/&gt; According to Makdisi, sectarianism reached its peak during the civil war that lasted from 1975 to 1990.&lt;ref name=Makdisi-b&gt;{{cite journal|last=Makdisi|first=Ussama|title=Reconstructing the Nation-State: The Modernity of Sectarianism in Lebanon|journal=Middle East Report|year=1996|volume=200|issue=200|pages=23–30|doi=10.2307/3013264|jstor=3013264}}&lt;/ref&gt; The militia politics that gripped Lebanon during the civil war represents another form of popular mobilization along sectarian lines against the elite-dominated Lebanese state.&lt;ref name=Makdisi/&gt;

Christians began setting up armed militias what they “saw as an attempt by the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) to seize Lebanon – those militias would be united under the Lebanese Forces umbrella in 1976”.&lt;ref name=Lebanon&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lebanon: The Persistence of Sectarian Conflict|journal=Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs|year=2013|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lebanese Sunni groups splintered into armed factions as well, competing against one another and against the Christian militias. The beginning of the Lebanese Civil War dates to 1975, when a Maronite militia opened fire on a bus full of civilians in response to an assassination attempt of a Maronite leader by PLO-affiliated Muslims.&lt;ref name=Lebanon/&gt; On May 31, seven weeks after fighting began between militias, Beirut witnessed its first sectarian massacre in which "unarmed civilians were killed simply on the grounds of their religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Eugene|title=The Arabs: A History|date=2009|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|page=382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Syria entered the conflict in June 1976, in order to avoid a PLO takeover of Lebanon – Syria's entry into the war resulted in a de facto division of the country into zones controlled by Syria, the PLO, and Maronite militias.&lt;ref name=Lebanon/&gt; Shi’a militias were also created, including the formation of Amal in the late 1970s and later when some Amal militants decided to create a more religious Shi’a militia known as [[Hezbollah]] (Party of God).

The Lebanese Civil War became a regional dilemma when Israel invaded in 1982 with two avowed aims: destroy the PLO military infrastructure and secure its northern frontier. In March 1989, Prime Minister (and Acting President) General Michel Aoun launched a “liberation war” against the Syrian army with the backing of the PLO and Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. In doing so, General Aoun internationalized the Lebanese crisis by “emphasized the destructive role of the Syrian army in the country”.&lt;ref name=Lebanon/&gt;  His decision resulted in multilateral negotiations as well as efforts to strengthen the role of the UN. By 1983, what had begun as an internal war between Lebanese factions had become a regional conflict that drew in Syria, Israel, Iran, Europe and the United States directly - with Iraq, Libya, Saudi Arabia, and the Soviet Union involved indirectly by providing financial support and weaponry to different militias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Eugene|title=The Arabs: A History|date=2009|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|page=411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After fifteen years of war, at least 100,000 Lebanese were dead, tens of thousands had emigrated abroad, and an estimated 900,000 civilians were internally displaced.&lt;ref name=Lebanon/&gt;

=====The Taif Agreement=====
{{main|Taif Agreement}}
After twenty-two days of discussions and negotiations, the surviving members of the 1972 parliament reached an agreement to end the Civil War on October 22, 1989. The Taif Agreement reconfigured the political power-sharing formula that formed that basis of government in Lebanon under the National Pact of 1943.&lt;ref name=Saseen&gt;{{cite book|last=Saseen|first=Sandra|title=The Taif Accord and Lebanon's Struggle to Regain its Sovereignty|year=1990|publisher=American University International Law Review|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As noted by Eugene Rogan, "the terms of Lebanon's political re-construction, enshrined in the Taif [Agreement], preserved many of the elements of the confessional system set up in the National Pact but modified the structure to reflect the demographic realities of modern Lebanon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Eugene|title=The Arabs: A History|date=2009|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|page=460}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, several key provisions of the National Pact were changed including: it relocated most presidential powers in favor of Parliament and the Council of Ministers and, as such, the Maronite Christian President lost most of his executive powers and only retained symbolic roles; it redistributed important public offices, including those of Parliament, Council of Ministers, general directors, and grade-one posts evenly between Muslims and Christians thereby upsetting the traditional ratio of six to five that favored Christians under the National Pact; it “recognized the chronic instability of confessionalism and called for devising a national strategy for its political demise. It required the formation of a national committee to examine ways to achieve deconfessionalization and the formation of a non-confessional Parliament," which has not yet been implemented to date&lt;ref name=Salamey&gt;{{cite book|last=Salamey|first=Imad|title=The Government and Politics of Lebanon|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it required the disarmament of all Lebanese militias; however, Hezbollah was allowed to retain its militant wing as a  “resistance force” in recognition of its fight against Israel in the South.&lt;ref name=Salamey/&gt;

=====Spillover from the Syrian conflict=====
{{main|Syrian Civil War}}
The Syrian conflict which began in 2011 when clashes began between the Assad government and opposition forces has had a profound effect on sectarian dynamics within Lebanon. In November 2013, the United States Institute of Peace published a Peace Brief in which Joseph Bahout assesses how the Syrian crisis has influenced Lebanon's sectarian and political dynamics. Bahout argues that the Syrian turmoil is intensifying Sunni-Shia tensions on two levels: “symbolic and identity-based on the one hand, and geopolitical or interest based, on the other hand." Syria's conflict has profoundly changed mechanisms of inter-sectarian mobilization in Lebanon: interest-based and “political” modes of mobilization are being transformed into identity-based and “religious” modes. Bahout notes that this shift is likely due to how these communities are increasingly perceiving themselves as defending not only their share of resources and power, but also their very survival. As the conflict grows more intense, the more the sectarian competition is internalized and viewed as a zero-sum game. Perceptions of existential threat exist among both the Shiite and Sunni communities throughout Lebanon: the continuation of the Syrian conflict will likely increase these perceptions over time and cause [[terrorism]].&lt;ref name=Bahout/&gt;

There are notable divisions within the Lebanese community along sectarian lines regarding the Syrian Civil War. The Shi'ite militant and political organization Hezbollah and its supporters back the Assad government, while many of the country's Sunni communities back the opposition forces. These tensions have played out in clashes between Sunnis and Shi'ites within Lebanon, resulting in clashes and deaths. For instance, clashes in the northern city of Tripoli, Lebanon left three dead when fighting broke out between Assad supporters and opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holmes|first=Oliver|title=Three dead in north Lebanon in spillover from Syria war|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/03/21/uk-syria-crisis-lebanon-clashes-idUKBREA2K0J320140321|access-date=8 April 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest concentration of Syrian refugees, close to one million people as of April 2014, can be found in Lebanon and has resulted in a population increase by about a quarter. According to the United Nations, the massive influx of refugees threatens to upset the “already fragile demographic balance between Shi’ites, Sunnis, Druze, and Christians.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryan|first=Missy|title=Syria refugee crisis poses major threat to Lebanese stability: U.N.|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/28/us-lebanon-usa-idUSBREA2R02E20140328|access-date=6 April 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lebanese government faces major challenges for handling the refugee influx, which has strained public infrastructure as Syrians seek housing, food, and healthcare at a time of economic slowdown in Lebanon.
