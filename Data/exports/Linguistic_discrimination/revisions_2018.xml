'''Linguistic discrimination''' (also called '''linguicism''' and '''languagism''') is the unfair treatment of an individual based solely on his or her use of language. This use of language may include the individual's native language or other characteristics of the person's speech, such as an [[Accent (dialect)|accent]], the size of [[vocabulary]] (whether the person uses complex and varied [[word]]s), [[Modality (semiotics)|modality]], and [[syntax]]. It may also involve a person's ability or inability to use one language instead of another; for example, one who speaks [[Occitan language|Occitan]] in [[France]] will probably be treated differently from one who speaks [[French language|French]].&lt;ref name="aclunc.org"&gt;The Legal Aid Society-Employment Law Center, &amp; the ACLU Foundation of North California (2002). Language Discrimination: Your Legal Rights. http://www.aclunc.org/library/publications/asset_upload_file489_3538.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a difference in use of language, a person may automatically form judgments about another person's [[wealth]], [[education]], [[social status]], character or other traits. These perceived judgments may then lead to the unjustifiable treatment of the individual.

In the mid-1980s, [[linguist]] Tove Skutnabb-Kangas, captured this idea of discrimination based on language as the concept of linguicism. Kangas defined linguicism as the "ideologies and structures which are used to legitimate, effectuate, and reproduce unequal division of power and resources (both material and non-material) between groups which are defined on the basis of language".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Skutnabb-Kangas, Tove, and Phillipson, Robert, "'Mother Tongue': The Theoretical and Sociopolitical Construction of a Concept." In Ammon, Ulrich (ed.) (1989). ''Status and Function of Languages and Language Varieties'', p. 455. Berlin, New York: Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co. {{ISBN|3-11-011299-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although different names have been given to this form of discrimination, they all hold the same definition. It is also important to note that linguistic discrimination is culturally and socially determined due to a preference for one use of language over another.

==Linguistic prejudice==
[[File:Corsican nationalism.jpg|thumb|Nationalists on [[Corsica]] sometimes spray-paint or shoot traffic signs carrying the official toponyms, leaving only the [[Corsican language]] toponyms]]

It can be noted that use of language such as certain accents may result in an individual experiencing prejudice. For example, some accents hold more prestige than others depending on the cultural context. However, with so many dialects, it can be difficult to determine which is the most preferable. The best answer linguists can give, such as the authors of [http://www.randomhouse.com/doubleday/doyouspeak/ "Do You Speak American?"], is that it depends on the location and the individual. Research has determined however that some sounds in languages may be determined to sound less pleasant naturally.&lt;ref&gt;Bresnahan, M. J., Ohashi, R., Nebashi, R., Liu, W. Y., &amp; Shearman, S. M. (2002). Attitudinal and affective response toward accented English. Language and Communication, 22, 171–185.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, certain accents tend to carry more prestige in some societies over other accents. For example, in the United States speaking [[General American]] (i.e., an absence of a regional or working class accent) is widely preferred in many contexts such as television journalism. Also, in the United Kingdom, the [[Received Pronunciation]] is associated with being of higher class and thus more likeable.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiana.edu/~hlw/PhonProcess/accents.html&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to prestige, research has shown that certain accents may also be associated with less intelligence, and having poorer social skills.&lt;ref&gt;Bradac, J. J. (1990). Language attitudes and impression formation. In H. Giles &amp; W. P. Robinson (Eds.), Handbook of language and social psychology (pp. 387–412). London: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; An example can be seen in the difference between Southerners and Northerners in the United States, where people from the North are typically perceived as being less likable in character, and Southerners are perceived as being less intelligent.

==Language and social group saliency==
[[File:Patriotic_propaganda_(16627007085).jpg|thumb|150px|right|Linguistic discrimination is sometimes linked with belonging to a social group, as in [[patriotism]] and [[nationalism]]. This poster is propaganda from [[World War I]]]]
It is natural for human beings to want to identify with others. One way we do this is by categorizing individuals into specific [[Social identity theory|social groups]]. While some groups may be readily noticeable (such as those defined by ethnicity or gender), other groups are less [[Salience (language)|salient]]. Linguist [https://www.pbs.org/speak/speech/ Carmen Fought] explains how an individual's use of language may allow another person to categorize them into a specific social group that may otherwise be less apparent. For example, in the United States it is common to perceive Southerners as less intelligent. Belonging to a social group such as the South may be less salient than membership to other groups that are defined by ethnicity or gender. Language provides a bridge for prejudice to occur for these less salient social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Jaspal, R. (2009). Language and social identity: a psychosocial approach.  Psych-Talk, 64, 17-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Linguistic discrimination is often defined in terms of prejudice of language. It is important to note that although there is a relationship between prejudice and discrimination, they are not always directly related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schütz | first1 = H. | last2 = Six | first2 = B. | year = 1996 | title = How strong is the relationship between prejudice and discrimination? A meta-analytic answer | url = | journal = International Journal of Intercultural Relations | volume = 20 | issue = 3–4| pages = 441–462 | doi=10.1016/0147-1767(96)00028-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Prejudice]] can be defined as negative attitudes towards an individual based solely on their membership of a social group, while [[discrimination]] can be seen as the acts towards the individual. The difference between the two should be recognized because an individual may hold a prejudice against someone due to their use of language, but they may not act out on that prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, B.E., &amp; Kite, M.E. (2010) The Psychology of Prejudice and Discrimination. Ed 2. pp.379-383. Cencage Learning: Belmont.&lt;/ref&gt; The following are examples of linguistic prejudice that may result in discrimination.

===Linguistic prejudice and minority groups===
While, theoretically, any individual may be the victim of linguicism regardless of social and ethnic status, oppressed and [[marginalized]] social minorities are often its most consistent targets, due to the fact that the speech varieties that come to be associated with such groups have a tendency to be stigmatized.

===In Canada===

====Quebec and Anglophone community====
The [[Charter of the French Language]], first established in 1977 and amended several times since, has been accused of being discriminatory by English speakers. The law makes French the official language of Quebec and mandates its use (with exceptions) in government offices and communiques, schools, and in commercial public relations. Though the proportion of English speakers had been in decline since the 1960s, the law accelerated this, and the 2006 census showed there had been a net drop of 180,000 native English speakers.&lt;ref name="collectiverightsquebec"&gt;Richard Y. Bourhis &amp; Pierre Foucher, [http://qcgn.squarespace.com/storage/website-resources/library/documents/national-assembly/Bill%20103%20Impact%20Study%20Collective%20Rights%20and%20Vitality%202011.01.05.pdf "Bill 103: Collective Rights and the declining vitality of the English-speaking communities of Quebec "], ''Canadian Institute for Research on Linguistic Minorities'', Version 3, November 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, the law has been seen as a way of ''preventing'' linguistic discrimination against French speakers, as part of the law's wider objective of preserving the French language against the increasing social and economic dominance of English. Speaking English at work continues to be strongly correlated with higher earnings, with French-only speakers earning significantly less.&lt;ref&gt;Louis N. Christofides &amp; Robert Swidinsky, [http://utpjournals.metapress.com/content/p0w06tr200310861/fulltext.pdf "The Economic Returns to the Knowledge and Use of a Second Official Language: English in Quebec and French in the Rest-of-Canada"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Canadian Public Policy – Analyse de Politiques Vol. XXXVI'', No. 2 2010 
&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the law is widely credited with successfully raising the status of French in a predominantly English-speaking economy, and has been influential in other countries facing similar circumstances.&lt;ref name="collectiverightsquebec"/&gt;

=== In the European Union ===

==== Linguistic disenfranchisement rate ====
The linguistic disenfranchisement rate in the EU can significantly vary across countries. For residents in two EU-countries that are either native speakers of English or proficient in English as a foreign language the disenfranchisement rate is equal to zero. In his study "''Multilingual communication for whom? Language policy and fairness in the European Union''" Michele Gazzola comes to the conclusion that the current multilingual policy of the EU is not in the absolute the most effective way to inform Europeans about the EU; in certain countries, additional languages may be useful to minimize linguistic exclusion.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Michele Gazzola, [https://www.academia.edu/28511833/Multilingual_communication_for_whom_Language_policy_and_fairness_in_the_European_Union ''Multilingual communication for whom? Language policy and fairness in the European Union''], European Union Politics, 2016, Vol. 17(4) 546–569&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 24 countries examined, an English-only language policy would exclude 51% to 90% of adult residents. A language regime based on English, French and German would disenfranchise 30% to 56% of residents, whereas a regime based on six languages would bring the shares of excluded population down to 9–22%.  After [[Brexit]], the rates of linguistic exclusion associated with a monolingual policy and with a trilingual and a hexalingual regime are likely to increase.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===In the United States===

====Perpetuation of discriminatory practices through terminology====
Here and elsewhere the terms 'standard' and 'non-standard' make analysis of linguicism difficult. These terms are used widely by linguists and non-linguists when discussing varieties of American English that engender strong opinions, a false dichotomy that is rarely challenged or questioned. This has been interpreted by linguists Nicolas Coupland, [[Rosina Lippi-Green]], and [[Robin Queen]] (among others) as a discipline-internal lack of consistency that undermines progress; if linguists themselves cannot move beyond the ideological underpinnings of 'right' and 'wrong' in language, there is little hope of advancing a more nuanced understanding in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Coupland, N. (1999). "Sociolinguistic Prevarication About 'Standard English'" Review article appearing in Tony Bex and Richard J. Watts (eds) ''Standard English: the Widening Debate'' London:Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lippi-Green, R. (2012) ''English with an Accent: Language, Ideology and Discrimination in the U.S..'' Second revised, expanded edition. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

====African-Americans====
Because some African-Americans speak a particular non-standard variety of English which is often seen as substandard, African-Americans are frequently the targets of linguicism. [[African American Vernacular English]] (AAVE) is often perceived by members of mainstream American society as indicative of low intelligence or limited education. Furthermore, as with many other non-standard dialects and especially creoles, AAVE sometimes has been called "lazy" or "bad" English.

The linguist [[John McWhorter]] has described this particular form of linguicism as particularly problematic in the United States, where non-standard linguistic structures are frequently judged by teachers and potential employers to be "incorrect," in contrast to a number of other countries such as Morocco, Finland and Italy where [[diglossia]] (a single person being able to switch between two or more dialects or languages) is an accepted norm, and use of non-standard grammar or vocabulary in conversation is seen as a mark of regional origin, not of intellectual capacity or achievement.

For example, an African-American who uses a typical AAVE sentence such as "He be comin' in every day and sayin' he ain't done nothing" may be judged as having a deficient command of grammar, whereas, in fact, such a sentence is constructed based on a complex grammar which is different from, and not a degenerate form of, standard English.&lt;ref&gt;Dicker, Susan J. (2nd ed., 2003). ''Languages in America: A Pluralist View'', pp. 7-8. Multilingual Matters Ltd. {{ISBN|1-85359-651-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A hearer may judge the user of such a sentence to be unintellectual or uneducated when none of these is necessarily the case. The user may be proficient in standard English, and may be intellectually capable, and educated but simply have chosen to say the sentence in AAVE for any one of a number of social and sociolinguistic reasons such as the intended audience of the sentence, a phenomenon known as [[Code-switching|code switching]].

====Hispanic Americans and linguicism====
Another form of linguicism is evidenced by the following: in some parts of the [[United States of America|United States]], a person who has a strong [[Mexico|Mexican]] accent and uses only simple [[English language|English]] words may be thought of as poor, poorly educated, and possibly an [[illegal immigrant]] by many of the people who meet them. However, if the same person has a diluted accent or no noticeable accent at all and can use a myriad of words in complex sentences, they are likely to be perceived as more successful, better educated, and a legitimate [[citizen]].

====American Sign Language users====
For centuries, users of [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) have faced linguistic discrimination based on the perception of the legitimacy of signed languages compared to spoken languages. This attitude was explicitly expressed in the [[Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf|Milan Conference]] of 1880 which set precedence for public opinion of manual forms of communication, including ASL, creating lasting consequences for members of the Deaf community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.verywell.com/deaf-history-milan-1880-1046547 |title=Deaf History - Milan 1880 |last=Berke |first=Jame |date=January 30, 2017 |website=Very Well |archive-url=https://archive.is/OPQ9B?url=https://www.verywell.com/deaf-history-milan-1880-1046547 |archivedate= 1 January 1970 |deadurl=no |accessdate=May 12, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The conference almost unanimously (save a handful of allies such as [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]]), reaffirmed the use of [[oralism]], instruction conducted exclusively in spoken language, as the preferred education method for Deaf individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hearinghealthmatters.org/hearinginternational/2016/the-international-deafness-controversy-of-1880/|title=The International Deafness Controversy of 1880|last=Traynor|first=Bob|date=June 1, 2016|website=Hearing Health and Technology Matters|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These ideas were outlined in eight resolutions which ultimately resulted in the removal of Deaf individuals from their own educational institutions, leaving generations of Deaf persons to be educated single-handedly by hearing individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dvdean.weebly.com/milan-conference-of-1880.html|title=Milan Conference of 1880|last=|first=|date=|website=Weebly |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to misconceptions about ASL, it was not recognized as its own, fully functioning language until recently. In the 1960s, linguist [[William Stokoe]] proved ASL to be its own language based on its unique structure and grammar, separate from that of English. Prior to this, ASL was thought to be merely a collection of gestures used to represent English. Because of its use of visual space, people mistakenly believed its users to be of a lesser mental capacity. The misconception that ASL users are incapable of complex thought was prevalent, although this has decreased as further studies about its recognition of a language have taken place. For example, ASL users faced overwhelming discrimination for the supposedly "lesser" language that they use and were met with condescension especially when using their language in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=David A.|last2=Akamatsu|first2=C. Tane|date=1988-01-01|title=The Coming of Age of American Sign Language|journal=Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|volume=19|issue=3|pages=235–252|doi=10.1525/aeq.1988.19.3.05x1559y|jstor=3195832}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way discrimination against ASL is evident is how, despite research conducted by linguists like Stokoe or [[Clayton Valli]] and Cecil Lucas of [[Gallaudet University]], ASL is not always recognized as a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unm.edu/~wilcox/UNM/facts.html|title=ASL as a Foreign Language Fact Sheet|website=www.unm.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its recognition is crucial both for those learning ASL as an additional language, and for prelingually-deaf children who learn ASL as their first language. Linguist Sherman Wilcox concludes that given that it has a body of literature and international scope, to single ASL out as unsuitable for a foreign language curriculum is inaccurate. Russel S. Rosen also writes about government and academic resistance to acknowledging ASL as a foreign language at the high school or college level, which Rosen believes often resulted from a lack of understanding about the language. Rosen and Wilcox's conclusions both point to discrimination ASL users face regarding its status as a language, that although decreasing over time is still present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosen|first=Russell S.|date=2008-01-01|title=American Sign Language as a Foreign Language in U.S. High Schools: State of the Art|journal=The Modern Language Journal|volume=92|issue=1|pages=10–38|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4781.2008.00684.x|jstor=25172990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the medical community, there is immense bias against deafness and ASL. This stems from the belief that spoken languages are superior to sign languages.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hyde|first=Merv|last2=Punch|first2=Renée|last3=Komesaroff|first3=Linda|date=2010-01-01|title=Coming to a Decision About Cochlear Implantation: Parents Making Choices for their Deaf Children|journal=Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education|volume=15|issue=2|pages=162–178|doi=10.1093/deafed/enq004|jstor=42659026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because 90% of deaf babies are born to hearing parents, who are usually unaware of the existence of the [[Deaf community|Deaf Community]], they often turn to the medical community for guidance.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crouch|first=Robert A.|date=1997-01-01|title=Letting the Deaf Be Deaf Reconsidering the Use of Cochlear Implants in Prelingually Deaf Children|journal=The Hastings Center Report|volume=27|issue=4|pages=14–21|doi=10.2307/3528774|jstor=3528774}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical and audiological professionals, who are typically biased against sign languages, encourage parents to get a [[cochlear implant]] for their deaf child in order for the child to use spoken language.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Research shows, however, that deaf kids without cochlear implants acquire ASL with much greater ease than deaf kids with cochlear implants acquire spoken English. In addition, medical professionals discourage parents from teaching ASL to their deaf kid to avoid compromising their English&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=10.5749/j.ctt9qh3m7.33|title=Deaf Gain|last=SKUTNABB-KANGAS|first=TOVE|last2=Solomon|first2=Andrew|last3=Skuttnab-Kangas|first3=Tove|date=2014-01-01|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=9780816691227|series=Raising the Stakes for Human Diversity|pages=492–502|doi=10.5749/j.ctt9qh3m7.33#page_scan_tab_contents}}&lt;/ref&gt; although research shows that learning ASL does not interfere with a child's ability to learn English. In fact, the early acquisition of ASL proves to be useful to the child in learning English later on. When making a decision about cochlear implantation, parents are not properly educated about the benefits of ASL or the Deaf Community.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This is seen by many members of the Deaf Community as cultural and linguistic genocide.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Texts===
Linguicism, of course, applies to [[written language|written]], [[spoken language|spoken,]] or [[Sign language|signed languages]].  The quality of a book or article may be judged by the language in which it is written.  In the scientific community, for example, those who evaluated a text in two language versions, English and the national [[Scandinavian language]], rated the English-language version as being of higher scientific content.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Jennifer (2003). ''World Englishes: A Resource Book for Students'', p. 200. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-25805-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Internet]] operates a great deal using written language.  Readers of a [[web page]], [[Usenet]] group, [[internet forum|forum]] post, or chat session may be more inclined to take the author seriously if the written language is spelled and constructed in accordance with the written norms of the standard language.

===Prejudice===
In contrast to the previous examples of linguistic prejudice, linguistic discrimination involves the actual treatment of individuals based on use of language. Examples may be clearly seen in the workplace, in the advertising industry, and in education systems. For example, some workplaces enforce an [[English-only movement|English-only policy]]. This policy is part of a larger political movement in the U.S. where English is being pushed towards being accepted as the official language of the U.S. In the United States, the federal law, Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects non-native speakers from being discriminated against in the workplace based on their national origin or use of dialect. There are state laws that also address the protection of non-native speakers, such as the California Fair Employment and Housing Act. However, industries often argue in retrospect that clear, understandable English is often needed in specific work settings in the U.S.&lt;ref name="aclunc.org"/&gt;

==Examples==
* [[Anglophone Cameroonian]]s: the central Cameroonian government has pushed ''francophonization'' in the English-speaking regions of the country despite constitutional stipulations on bilingualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foretia|first1=Denis|title=Cameroon continues its oppression of English speakers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2017/03/21/cameroon-continues-its-oppression-of-english-speakers/|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=15 May 2017|date=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measures include appointing French-speaking teachers and judges (in regions with [[Common Law]]) despite local desires.
* The [[Coptic language]]. At the turn of the 8th century, [[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] decreed that [[Arabic language|Arabic]] would replace [[Koine Greek]] and Coptic as the sole administrative language.

* [[Anti-Chinese legislation in Indonesia]]
* [[Language law of Slovakia|Anti-Hungarian Slovak language law]]
* Dutch in Belgium after its independence in 1830. French was for a long time the only official language and the sole language of education, administration, law and justice despite Dutch being the language of the majority of the population. This has led to a massive [[Francisation of Brussels|language shift in Brussels]], the capital. Discrimination slowly diminished over the decades and formally ended in the 1960s, when the Dutch version of the constitution became equal to the French version.
* The policy of [[Ukrainization]] in post-1991 [[Ukraine]] is considered discriminatory by the Russian-speaking population of Ukraine's Eastern and Southern regions.
* The brutality and linguicism against Tamils in Sri Lanka that took the lives of thousands of Tamil lives because of the language they spoke. This was rooted from "[[Sinhala Only Act#cite note-Consolidated Acts-1|The Sinhala Only Act]]", formerly the Official Language Act No. 33 of 1956, that was passed in the Parliament of Ceylon in 1956. [[Black July]] was the peak of the violence against Tamils in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-23402727 | title=Remembering Sri Lanka's Black July | first=Charles | last=Haviland| date=23 July 2013 | publisher=BBC | accessdate=7 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[South Africa]]: Carolyn McKinley&lt;ref&gt;Associate professor in the education department of the University of Cape Town and author of 'Language and Power in Post-Colonial Schooling: Ideologies in Practice'&lt;/ref&gt; is highly critical of the language policy in the South African educational system, which she describes as 'anglonormatif', because the increasing [[anglicisation]] becomes 'normative' in the education system. The [[University of Pretoria|universities of Pretoria]], [[University of the Free State|Free State]] and Unisa want to anglicise completely. [[Stellenbosch University]] has accepted a [[language policy]] that considers [[Afrikaans]] speakers and their language to be inferior.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ebbe Dommisse, [https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/life/books/2016-11-16-single-dominant-tongue-keeps-inequality-in-place/ Single dominant tongue keeps inequality in place], 16 November 2016. The Business Day&lt;/ref&gt;  Constitutional law expert and Stellenbosch University alumni [[Pierre de Vos]] says :  ''&lt;small&gt;any university language policy that directly or indirectly excludes non-Afrikaans speakers (because some courses are only taught in Afrikaans) would not comply with section 29(2) of the Constitution.&lt;/small&gt;'' On the other hand, section 29(2) of the Constitution does not guarantee equality as it states that ''&lt;small&gt;"everyone has the right to receive education in the official language or languages of their choice in public educational institutions such as schools or universities, but qualifies this by stating that this can only occur "where that education is reasonably practicable".&lt;/small&gt;''
*[[China]]: In the 2000s the Chinese government began promoting the use of [[Mandarin Chinese]] in areas where [[Cantonese]] is spoken. In 2010 this gave rise to the [[Guangzhou Television Cantonese controversy]]. This has also been a point of contention with [[Hong Kong]], which is located in the general area where Cantonese is spoken. Cantonese has become a means of asserting Hong Kong's political identity as separate from mainland China.

Carolyn McKinley&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; is critical of a [[Linguistic imperialism|dominant language]] because it does not only discriminate against speakers of other languages, it also disadvantages monolinguists because they remain monolingual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Instead of using the [[indigenous language]]s along with the colonial languages, as McKinley also advocates, most African states still use the colonial language as the primary medium of instruction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, in authoritative reports by [[UNESCO|Unesco]], it was found that the use of the former colonial languages in Africa benefited only the elite and disadvantaged the bulk of the populations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although English has global meaning as a language of discourse, it is not a neutral, unbiased instrument as it leads too much to a culture-dependent perspective in thinking and talking by the use of culturally bound value concepts, often being invisible value judgments and frames of reference inherent to and shaped by "Anglo culture", according to [[Anna Wierzbicka]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Anna Wierzbicka, Professor of Linguistics, Australian National University and author of '[https://global.oup.com/academic/product/imprisoned-in-english-9780199321506?cc=be&amp;lang=en&amp; Imprisoned by English], The Hazards of English as a Default Language, written in [[Natural semantic metalanguage|Natural Semantic Metalanguage]] (NSM), the universally convertible currency of communication,  that can serve as a common [[International auxiliary language|auxiliary]] [[Interlanguage|inter-language]] for speakers of different languages and a global means for clarifying, elucidating, storing, and comparing ideas" (194) ([http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0075424214558927 book review])&lt;/ref&gt;
