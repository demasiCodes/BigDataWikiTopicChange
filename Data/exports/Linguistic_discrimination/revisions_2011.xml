{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''Linguistic discrimination''' is [[discrimination]] based on [[native language]], usually in the [[language policy]] especially in [[education policy|education]] of a state that has one or several [[linguistic minority|linguistic minorities]].

Critics denounce linguistic discrimination as a violation of [[linguistic rights]]. Discrimination against minority language is an aspect of [[linguistic imperialism]].

While linguistic discrimination was common in [[Europe]] during the formation of [[nation states]] in the 19th century, it was countered by opposing trends of [[linguistic protectionism]] and [[language revival]] in the 20th century.

==Examples==
*the [[Coptic language]].  At the turn of the 8th century, [[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] decreed that [[Arabic language|Arabic]] replace [[Koine Greek]] and Coptic as the sole administrative language. Literary Coptic gradually declined such that within a few hundred years, and suffered violent persecutions especially  under the [[Mamluk]]s, leading to its virtual extinction by the 17th century.
*Language policy of the British Empire in [[Ireland]], [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]]. [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]'s conquest, the long [[Plantations of Ireland|English colonisation]] and [[Great Irish Famine]] made [[Irish language|Irish]] a minority language by the end of 19th century. It had not official status until the establishment of [[Republic of Ireland]]. In Wales speaking of the [[Welsh language]] in schools was [[Welsh Not|prohibited]]. [[Scottish Gaelic]] also had not official status until [[Languages in the United Kingdom#Status|the end of 20th century]]. [[Scots language|Scots]] was often treated as a mere dialect of English.
*[[Basque language|Basque]]: Public usage of Basque was prohibited in [[Spain under Franco]], 1939 to 1965. [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] have similar histories.
*[[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]: Kurdish remains banned in [[Syria]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/wire/March2005/Syria Repression of Kurds in Syria is widespread], [[Amnesty International]] Report, March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Until August 2002, the [[Turkish government]] placed severe restrictions on the use of Kurdish, prohibiting the language in education and broadcast media&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/action/special/zana.html Special Focus Cases: Leyla Zana, Prisoner of Conscience]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemuse.org/sw6195.asp Kurdish performers banned, Appeal from International PEN]&lt;/ref&gt;.
*[[Vergonha]], the term used for the effect of various policies of the [[French government]] on its citizens whose mother tongue was one of so-called patois. In 1539 with Art. 111 of the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts]] [[French language|French]] (the language of [[Île-de-France (province)|Ile-de-France]]) became only official language in the country. Since then the using of the languages of southern France (also called [[langues d'oc]]) as well as [[Breton language|Breton]] in education and administration was prohibited. The French government hasn't still ratified the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]].
*[[Russification]]: Under the [[Russian Empire]] there were some [[Russification of Finland|attempts]] in 1899-1917 to make [[Russian language|Russian]]  the ''only'' official language of [[Finland]]. In the [[Soviet Union]], following the phase of [[Korenizatsiya]] ("indigenization") and before [[Perestroika]] (late 1930s to late 1980s), Russian was termed as "the language of friendship of nations", to the disadvantage of other [[languages of the Soviet Union]]  
*suppression of [[Korean language|Korean]] during [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule in Korea]], 1910 to 1945.
*[[Anti-Chinese legislation in Indonesia]]
*Anti-Hungarian Slovak language law
