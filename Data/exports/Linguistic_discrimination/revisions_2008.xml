{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''Linguistic discrimination''' is [[discrimination]] based on [[native language]], usually in the [[language policy]] especially in [[education policy|education]] of a state that has one or several [[linguistic minority|linguistic minorities]].

Critics denounce linguistic discrimination as a violation of [[linguistic rights]]. Discrimination against minority language is an aspect of [[linguistic imperialism]].

While linguistic discrimination was common in Europe during the formation of [[nation states]] in the 19th century, it has mostly given way to the opposite trends ([[positive discrimination]]) of  [[linguistic protectionism]] and efforts of [[language revival]] in the 20th century.

Examples of historical repression of minority languages:
*the [[Coptic language]].  At the turn of the 8th century, [[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik|Abdel al-Malik bin Marwan]] decreed that [[Arabic language|Arabic]] replace [[Koine Greek]] and Coptic as the sole administrative language. Literary Coptic gradually declined such that within a few hundred years, and suffered violent persecutions especially  under the [[Mamluk]]s, leading to its virtual extinction by the 17th century.
*[[Welsh language|Welsh]] in 18th to 19th century [[Wales]]: [[Welsh Not]]
*[[Basque language|Basque]]: Public usage of Basque was prohibited in [[Spain under Franco]], 1939 to 1965. [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] have similar histories.
*[[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]: Kurdish remains is banned in [[Syria]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/wire/March2005/Syria Repression of Kurds in Syria is widespread], [[Amnesty International]] Report, March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Until August 2002, the [[Turkish government]] placed severe restrictions on the use of Kurdish, prohibiting the language in education and broadcast media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/action/special/zana.html Special Focus Cases: Leyla Zana, Prisoner of Conscience]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemuse.org/sw6195.asp Kurdish performers banned, Appeal from International PEN]&lt;/ref&gt;. 
*[[Russification]]: Under the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Russian language]] was made the official language of [[Finland]] ([[Russification of Finland]]). In the [[Soviet Union]], following the phase of [[Korenizatsiya]] ("indigenization") and before [[Perestroika]] (late 1930s to late 1980s), Russian was termed as "the language of friendship of nations", to the disadvantage of other [[languages of the Soviet Union]]  
*suppression of [[Korean language|Korean]] during [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule in Korea]], 1910 to 1945.
*[[Anti-Chinese legislation in Indonesia]]
