==History==
White supremacy has ideological foundations that date back to 17th-century [[scientific racism]], the predominant paradigm of human variation that helped shape international relations and racial policy from the latter part of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] until the late 20th century (marked by decolonization and the abolition of [[apartheid]] in South Africa in 1991, followed by that country's [[South African general election, 1994|first multiracial elections in 1994]]).{{Cn|date=July 2022}}

Wray said that the Bureau was "aggressively pursuing [domestic terrorism] using both counterterrorism resources and criminal investigative resources and partnering closely with our state and local partners," but said that it was focused on the violence itself and not on its ideological basis. A similar number of arrests had been made for instances of international terrorism. In the past, Wray has said that white supremacy was a significant and "pervasive" threat to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Chalfant, Morgan (July 23, 2019) [https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/454338-fbis-wray-says-majority-of-domestic-terrorism-arrests-this-year "FBI's Wray says most domestic terrorism arrests this year involve white supremacy"] ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, 2019, the acting [[Secretary of Homeland Security]], [[Kevin McAleenan]], announced his department's revised strategy for counter-terrorism, which included a new emphasis on the dangers inherent in the white supremacy movement. McAleenan called white supremacy one of the most "potent ideologies" behind domestic terrorism-related violent acts. In a speech at the [[Brookings Institution]], McAleenan cited a series of high-profile shooting incidents, and said "In our modern age, the continued menace of racially based violent extremism, particularly white supremacist extremism, is an abhorrent affront to the nation, the struggle and unity of its diverse population." The new strategy will include better tracking and analysis of threats, sharing information with local officials, training local law enforcement on how to deal with shooting events, discouraging the hosting of hate sites online, and encouraging counter-messages.&lt;ref&gt;Sands, Geneva (September 20, 2019) [https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/20/politics/dhs-counterterrorism-strategy/index.html "Homeland Security counterterrorism strategy focuses on white supremacy threat"] ''[[CNN]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Pete (September 20, 2019) [https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/department-homeland-security-strategy-adds-white-supremacy-list-threats-n1057136 "Department of Homeland Security strategy adds white supremacy to list of threats"] ''[[NBC News]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2020 article in ''The New York Times'' titled "How White Women Use Themselves as Instruments of Terror", columnist [[Charles M.

{{Quote|We often like to make white supremacy a testosterone-fueled masculine expression, but it is just as likely to wear heels as a hood. Indeed, untold numbers of lynchings were executed because white women had claimed that a black man raped, assaulted, talked to or glanced at them. The [[Tulsa race massacre]], the destruction of Black Wall Street, was spurred by an incident between a white female elevator operator and a black man. 
As the Oklahoma Historical Society points out, the most common explanation is that he stepped on her toe. As many as 300 people were killed because of it. The torture and murder of 14-year-old [[Emmett Till]] in 1955, a lynching actually, occurred because a white woman said that he "grabbed her and was menacing and sexually crude toward her". This practice, this exercise in racial extremism has been dragged into the modern era through the weaponizing of 9-1-1, often by white women, to invoke the power and force of the police who they are fully aware are hostile to black men. This was again evident when a [[Central Park birdwatching incident|white woman in New York's Central Park]] told a black man, a bird-watcher, that she was going to call the police and tell them that he was threatening her life.}}

==== Patterns of influence ====

===== Political violence =====
The [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Institute]] has estimated that 3,446 blacks were the victims of [[lynchings in the United States]] between 1882 and 1968, with the peak occurring in the 1890s at a time of economic stress in the South and increasing political suppression of blacks. If 1,297 whites were also lynched during this period, blacks were disproportionally targeted, representing 72.7% of all people lynched.&lt;ref name="tuskegee_umkc"&gt;{{cite web |title=Lynchings: By State and Race, 1882–1968 |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/lynchingsstate.html  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629081241/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/lynchingsstate.html |archive-date=June 29, 2010 |access-date=July 26, 2010 |publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law |quote=Statistics provided by the Archives at Tuskegee Institute.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=History of Lynchings |url=https://www.naacp.org/history-of-lynchings/ |access-date=July 1, 2020 |website=NAACP |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to scholar Amy L.

===== School curriculum =====
{{Main|White supremacy in U.S. school curriculum}}

White supremacy has also played a part in U.S. school curriculum. Over the course of the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries, material across the spectrum of academic disciplines has been taught with a heavy emphasis on White culture, contributions, and experiences, and a lack of representation of non-White groups' perspectives and accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, M.

He states that the language used to tell history minimizes the violent acts committed by White people over the centuries, citing the use of the words, for example, "discovery," "colonization," and "[[New World]]" when describing what was ultimately a European conquest of the [[Western Hemisphere]] and its [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous peoples]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Swartz (1992) seconds this reading of modern history narratives when it comes to the experiences, resistances, and accomplishments of [[African Americans|Black Americans]] throughout the [[Middle Passage]], [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]], [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]], and the [[Civil rights movement]]. In an analysis of American history textbooks, she highlights word choices that repetitively "normalize" slavery and the inhumane treatment of Black people. She also notes the frequent showcasing of White [[Abolitionism|abolitionists]] and actual exclusion of Black abolitionists and the fact that Black Americans had been mobilizing for abolition for centuries before the major White American push for abolition in the 19th century. She ultimately asserts the presence of a ''masternarrative'' that centers Europe and its associated peoples (White people) in school curriculum, particularly as it pertains to history.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Swartz, Ellen (1992). "Emancipatory Narratives: Rewriting the Master Script in the School Curriculum". ''The Journal of Negro Education''. '''61'''(3): 341–355. {{doi|10.2307/2295252}}. {{ISSN|0022-2984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She writes that this masternarrative condenses history into only history that is relevant to, and to some extent beneficial for, White Americans.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===== Role of the internet =====
With the emergence of Twitter in 2006, and platforms such as ''[[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]]'' which was launched in 1996, an [[alt-right]] portal for white supremacists with similar beliefs, both adults and children, was provided in which they were given a way to connect. Jessie Daniels, of [[Hunter College|CUNY-Hunter College]], discussed the emergence of other social media outlets such as [[4chan]] and [[Reddit]], which meant that the "spread of white nationalist symbols and ideas could be accelerated and amplified."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Sociologist [[Kathleen Blee]] notes that the anonymity which the Internet provides can make it difficult to track the extent of white supremacist activity in the country, but nevertheless she and other experts&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/8/6/20754828/el-paso-shooting-white-supremacy-rise ''The El Paso shooting isn't an anomaly.

In the latest wave of white supremacy, in the age of the Internet, Blee sees the movement as having primarily become a virtual one, in which divisions between groups become blurred: "[A]ll these various groups that get jumbled together as the alt-right and people who have come in from the more traditional neo-Nazi world.

Some of the activity is virtual. Some of it is in a physical place. Social media has lowered the collective-action problems that individuals who might want to be in a hate group would face. You can see that there are people out there like you.

====South Africa====
{{Further|Apartheid|Baasskap}}
A number of Southern African nations experienced severe racial tension and conflict during global [[decolonization]], particularly as [[white Africans of European ancestry]] fought to protect their preferential social and political status. Racial segregation in South Africa began in colonial times under the [[Dutch Empire]]. It continued when the British took over the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1795. [[Apartheid]] was introduced as an officially structured policy by the [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]]-dominated [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] after the [[South African general election, 1948|general election of 1948]]. Apartheid's legislation divided inhabitants into four racial groups—"black", "white", "coloured", and "Indian", with coloured divided into several sub-classifications.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin-Ragaven, Laurel; London, Lesley; du Gruchy, Jeanelle (1999).

===Germany===
{{Further|Aryanism}}

[[Nazism]] promoted the idea of a superior [[Germanic people]] or [[Aryan race]] in Germany during the early 20th century. Notions of white supremacy and Aryan racial superiority were combined in the 19th century, with white supremacists maintaining the belief that white people were members of an Aryan "[[master race]]" that was superior to other races, particularly the Jews, who were described as the "Semitic race", [[Slavs]], and [[Names of the Romani people|Gypsies]], who they associated with "cultural sterility". [[Arthur de Gobineau]], a French racial theorist and aristocrat, blamed the fall of the [[Ancien Régime|''ancien régime'']] in France on racial degeneracy caused by racial intermixing, which he argued had destroyed the "purity" of the Nordic or Germanic race. Gobineau's theories, which attracted a strong following in Germany, emphasized the existence of an irreconcilable polarity between Aryan or Germanic peoples and Jewish culture.&lt;ref&gt;Blamires, Cyprian; Jackson, Paul. "[http://search.proquest.com/openview/9c41b2e7d5a2e90cf01120ea183d7874/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=40834 World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia]": Volume 1. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, Inc, 2006. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Nazi Party]]'s chief racial theorist, [[Alfred Rosenberg]] oversaw the construction of a human racial "ladder" that justified [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Hitler's racial and ethnic policies]]. Rosenberg promoted the [[Nordic theory]], which regarded [[Nordic race|Nordics]] as the "master race", superior to all others, including other Aryans (Indo-Europeans).&lt;ref&gt;Though Rosenberg does not use the word "master race". He uses the word "Herrenvolk" (i. e., ruling people) twice in his book ''The Myth'', first referring to the [[Amorite]]s (saying that [[Archibald Sayce|Sayce]] described them as fair skinned and blue eyed) and secondly quoting [[Victor Wallace Germains]]' description of the English in "The Truth about Kitchener". ("The Myth of the Twentieth Century") – Pages 26, 660 – 1930&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenberg got the racial term ''[[Untermensch]]'' from the title of [[Klansman]] [[Lothrop Stoddard]]'s 1922 book ''The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under-man''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Stoddard, Lothrop| author-link = Lothrop Stoddard| year = 1922| title = The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under Man| publisher = [[Charles Scribner's Sons]]| location = New York| url = https://archive.org/details/revoltagainstciv00stoduoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later adopted by the Nazis from that book's German version ''Der Kulturumsturz: Die Drohung des Untermenschen'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Losurdo, Domenico| author-link = Domenico Losurdo| others = Translated by Marella &amp; Jon Morris| year = 2004| title = Toward a Critique of the Category of Totalitarianism| journal = [[Historical Materialism (journal)|Historical Materialism]]| volume = 12| issue = 2| pages = 25–55, here p. 50| issn = 1465-4466| doi = 10.1163/1569206041551663| url = http://www.pssp.org/bbs/data/document/1/Losurdo___Critique_of_Totalitarianism_%282004%29.pdf| format = PDF, 0.2 MB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenberg was the leading Nazi who attributed the concept of the East-European "under man" to Stoddard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Rosenberg, Alfred| author-link = Alfred Rosenberg| year = 1930| title = Der Mythus des 20.

In establishing a restrictive entry system for Germany in 1925, Hitler wrote of his admiration for America's immigration laws: "The American Union categorically refuses the immigration of physically unhealthy elements, and simply excludes the immigration of certain races."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/american-laws-against-coloreds-influenced-nazi-racial-planners/ "American laws against 'coloreds' influenced Nazi racial planners"]. Times of Israel. Retrieved August 26, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

German praise for America's institutional racism, previously found in Hitler's ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', was continuous throughout the early 1930s. Nazi lawyers were advocates of the use of American models.&lt;ref name="Whitman"/&gt; Race-based U.S. citizenship and anti-miscegenation laws directly inspired the Nazis' two principal [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg racial laws]]—the Citizenship Law and the Blood Law.&lt;ref name="Whitman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitman|first1=James Q.|title=Hitler's American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law|date=2017|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=37–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; To preserve the Aryan or [[Nordic race]], the Nazis introduced the Nuremberg Laws in 1935, which forbade sexual relations and marriages between Germans and Jews, and later between Germans and [[Romani people|Romani]] and [[Slavs]]. The Nazis used the [[Mendelian inheritance]] theory to argue that social traits were innate, claiming that there was a racial nature associated with certain general traits such as inventiveness or criminal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Friedlander]].

==Ideologies and movements==
Supporters of [[Nordic race#Nordicism|Nordicism]] consider the "Nordic peoples" to be a superior race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nordicism|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nordicism|website=Merriam Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 19th century, white supremacy was attached to emerging theories of racial hierarchy. The German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] attributed cultural primacy to the white race:

{{Quote|The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the [[Brahmin]]s, the [[Inca Empire|Incas]], and the rulers of the [[Polynesia|South Sea Islands]]. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | author-link = Arthur Schopenhauer | title = ''Parerga and Paralipomena'' | year = 1851 | pages = Vol. 2, Section 92| title-link = Parerga and Paralipomena }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[eugenics|eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]] argued in his 1916 book, ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'', that the Nordic race had been responsible for most of humanity's great achievements, and that [[Miscegenation|admixture]] was "race suicide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Grant | first = Madison | title = The Passing of the Great Race | publisher = C.

In the United States, the groups most associated with the white supremacist movement are the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK), [[Aryan Nations]], and the [[White American Resistance]] movement, all of which are also considered to be [[Antisemitism in the United States|antisemitic]]. The [[Proud Boys]], despite claiming non-association with white supremacy, have been described in academic contexts as being such.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; Many white supremacist groups are based on the concept of preserving genetic purity, and do not focus solely on discrimination based on skin color.

[[Nazi Germany]] promulgated white supremacy based on the belief that the [[Aryan race]], or the Germans, were the ''[[master race]]''.

This may include the establishment of a [[white ethnostate]] by removing non-whites from existing communities or by forming new communities elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3719/is_200607/ai_n16855771/pg_9/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203033702/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3719/is_200607/ai_n16855771/pg_9  |archive-date=December 3, 2007 |title=The Strategy of White Separatism |journal=Journal of Political and Military Sociology |date=Summer 2006 |last1=Dobratz |first1=Betty A. |last2=Shanks-Meile |first2=Stephanie L. |name-list-style=amp|volume=34 |number=1 |pages=49–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern researchers do not view white separatism as distinct from white supremacist beliefs. The [[Anti-Defamation League]] defines white separatism as "a form of white supremacy";&lt;ref name="ADL"&gt;{{cite web |title=White Separatism |url=https://www.adl.org/resources/glossary-terms/white-separatism |publisher=ADL}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Southern Poverty Law Center defines both white nationalism and white separatism as "ideologies based on white supremacy."&lt;ref name="SPLC"&gt;{{cite web |title=SPLC reacts to Facebook policy on white nationalism |url=https://www.splcenter.org/news/2019/03/27/splc-reacts-facebook-policy-white-nationalism |publisher=SPLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook has banned content that is openly [[white nationalism|white nationalist]] or white separatist because "white nationalism and white separatism cannot be meaningfully separated from white supremacy and organized hate groups".&lt;ref name="Facebook"&gt;{{cite web |title=Standing Against Hate |date=March 27, 2019 |url=https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/03/standing-against-hate/ |publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Facebook to ban white nationalism and separatism |work=BBC News |date=March 28, 2019 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47728471 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the term to self-identify has been criticized as a dishonest rhetorical ploy. The Anti-Defamation League argues that white supremacists use the phrase because they believe it has fewer negative connotations than the term ''white supremacist''.&lt;ref name="ADL_def"&gt;{{cite web |title=ADL: White Separatism |url=https://www.adl.org/resources/glossary-terms/white-separatism |website=adl.org |publisher=The Anti-Defamation League |access-date=November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobratz &amp; Shanks-Meile reported that adherents usually reject [[Interracial marriage|marriage "outside the white race"]]. They argued for the existence of "a distinction between the white supremacist's desire to dominate (as in [[apartheid]], [[slavery]], or [[Racial segregation|segregation]]) and complete separation by race".&lt;ref&gt;Dobratz, Betty A. &amp; Shanks-Meile, Stephanie L. (2000) ''The White Separatist Movement in the United States: "White Power, White Pride!''. Baltimore: JHU Press. pp.vii, 10&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that this is a matter of pragmatism, that while many white supremacists are also white separatists, contemporary white separatists reject the view that returning to a system of segregation is possible or desirable in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Dobratz |first1=Betty A. |last2=Shanks-Meile |first2=Stephanie L. |name-list-style=amp|year=1997 |title=The White Separatist Movement in the United States: White Power, White Pride! |location=New York |publisher=Twayne Publishers |isbn=978-0-8057-3865-0 |oclc=37341476 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r59bGyH4lOAC|pages=ix,12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic use of the term==
The term ''white supremacy'' is used in some academic studies of racial power to denote a system of structural or [[societal racism]] which privileges white people over others, regardless of the presence or the absence of racial hatred. According to this definition, white racial advantages occur at both a collective and an individual level (''[[ceteris paribus]]'', {{Nowrap|i. e.}}, when individuals are compared that do not relevantly differ except in ethnicity). Legal scholar Frances Lee Ansley explains this definition as follows:

{{Quote|By "white supremacy" I do not mean to allude only to the self-conscious racism of white supremacist [[hate group]]s. I refer instead to a political, economic and cultural system in which whites overwhelmingly control power and material resources, conscious and unconscious ideas of white superiority and entitlement are widespread, and relations of white dominance and non-white subordination are daily reenacted across a broad array of institutions and social settings.&lt;ref name="ansley1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ansley2"/&gt;}}

This and similar definitions have been adopted or proposed by [[Charles W. Mills]],&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mills |first=C.W. |author-link=Charles W.

Some [[anti-racism|anti-racist]] educators, such as Betita Martinez and the Challenging White Supremacy workshop, also use the term in this way. The term expresses historic continuities between a pre–[[civil rights movement]] era of open white supremacy and the current racial power structure of the United States. It also expresses the visceral impact of structural racism through "provocative and brutal" language that characterizes racism as "nefarious, global, systemic, and constant".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Davidson |first=Tim |title=Critical perspectives on bell hooks |date=February 23, 2009 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis US |isbn=978-0-415-98980-0 |editor1=Jeanette Davidson |page=68 |chapter=bell hooks, white supremacy, and the academy |editor2=George Yancy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic users of the term sometimes prefer it to ''racism'' because it allows for a distinction to be drawn between racist feelings and white racial advantage or [[white privilege|privilege]].&lt;ref&gt;"Why is it so difficult for many white folks to understand that racism is oppressive not because white folks have prejudicial feelings about blacks (they could have such feelings and leave us alone) but because it is a system that promotes domination and subjugation?" {{Cite book |last=hooks |first=bell |title=Black Looks: Race and Representation |date=February 4, 2009 |publisher=Turnaround Publisher Services Limited |isbn=978-1-873262-02-3 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grillo and Wildman cite hooks to argue for the term ''racism/white supremacy'': "hooks writes that liberal whites do not see themselves as either prejudiced or interested in domination through coercion, and they do not acknowledge the ways in which they contribute to and benefit from the system of white privilege." {{Cite book |last1=Grillo |first1=Trina |title=Critical white studies: Looking behind the mirror |author2=Stephanie M.

Other intellectuals have criticized the term's recent rise in popularity among leftist activists as counterproductive. John McWhorter has described the use of "white supremacy" as straying from its commonly accepted meaning to encompass less extreme issues, thereby cheapening the term and potentially derailing productive discussion.&lt;ref name="left language"&gt;{{cite news |title=Left Language, Right Language |newspaper=Wnyc |url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/left-language-right-language/ |access-date=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McWhorter"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=McWhorter |first1=John |title=The Difference Between Racial Bias and White Supremacy |url=http://time.com/4584161/white-supremacy/ |magazine=TIME |access-date=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political columnist [[Kevin Drum]] attributes the term's growing popularity to frequent use by [[Ta-Nehisi Coates]], describing it as a "terrible fad" which fails to convey nuance. He claims that the term should be reserved for those who are trying to promote the idea that whites are inherently superior to blacks and not used to characterize less blatantly racist beliefs or actions.&lt;ref name="MotherJ"&gt;{{cite web |title=Let's Be Careful With the "White Supremacy" Label |url=https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/11/lets-please-kill-white-supremacy-fad |access-date=December 4, 2016 |website=Mother Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedersdorf"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Friedersdorf |first=Conor |title='The Scourge of the Left': Too Much Stigma, Not Enough Persuasion |language=en-US |newspaper=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/the-scourge-of-the-left-too-much-stigma-not-enough-persuasion/508961/ |access-date=December 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic use of the term to refer to [[systemic racism]] has been criticized by [[Conor Friedersdorf]] for the confusion it creates for the general public inasmuch as it differs from the more common dictionary definition; he argues that it is likely to alienate those it hopes to convince.&lt;ref name="Friedersdorf" /&gt;
