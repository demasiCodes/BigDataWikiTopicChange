'''White supremacism''' is the [[racist]] belief, or promotion of the belief, that [[white people]] are superior to people of other [[race (human classification)|racial backgrounds]] and that therefore whites should politically, economically and socially dominate non-whites. The term is also typically used to describe a [[political ideology]] that perpetuates and maintains the [[society|social]], [[politics|political]], [[historical revisionism|historical]] and/or [[institutional racism|industrial]] dominance of whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Privilege Revealed: How Invisible Preference Undermines America |last=Wildman |first=Stephanie M. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1996 |publisher=NYU Press |location= |isbn=0-8147-9303-7 |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different forms of white supremacism have different conceptions of who is considered white, and different white supremacists identify various racial and cultural groups as their primary enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Spaces of Hate: Geographies of Discrimination and Intolerance in the U.S.A. |last=Flint |first=Colin |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=0-415-93586-5 |page=53 |quote=Although white racist activists must adopt a political identity of whiteness, the flimsy definition of whiteness in modern culture poses special challenges for them.

==History of White supremacy==

===United States===
{{category see also|White supremacy in the United States}}
White supremacy was dominant in the [[United States]] before the [[American Civil War]] and for decades after [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fredrickson | first = George | title = White Supremacy | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford Oxfordshire | year = 1981 | isbn = 0-19-503042-7 |page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; In large areas of the United States, this included the holding of non-whites (specifically [[African American]]s) in [[slavery in the United States|chattel slavery]]. The outbreak of the Civil War saw the desire to uphold white supremacy cited as a cause for state secession&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_texsec.asp A Declaration of the Causes which Impel the State of Texas to Secede from the Federal Union]: "We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable. That in this free government all white men are and of right ought to be entitled to equal civil and political rights; that the servitude of the African race, as existing in these States, is mutually beneficial to both bond and free, and is abundantly authorized and justified by the experience of mankind, and the revealed will of the Almighty Creator, as recognized by all Christian nations; while the destruction of the existing relations between the two races, as advocated by our sectional enemies, would bring inevitable calamities upon both and desolation upon the fifteen slave-holding states."&lt;/ref&gt; and the formation of the [[Confederate States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?documentprint=76 The "Cornerstone Speech", Alexander H. Stephens (Vice President of the Confederate States), March 21, 1861, Savannah, Georgia]: "Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery--subordination to the superior race--is his natural and normal condition."&lt;/ref&gt;

In some parts of the United States, many people who were considered non-white were [[disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], barred from government office, and prevented from holding most government jobs well into the second half of the 20th century. Many [[U.S. state]]s banned [[interracial marriage]] through [[anti-miscegenation laws]] until 1967, when these laws were [[Loving v. Virginia|declared unconstitutional]]. Additionally, white leaders often viewed [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] as obstacles to economic and political [[progress (history)|progress]] with respect to the natives' claims to land and rights.

===Germany===
[[Nazism]] promoted the idea of a superior [[Aryan race]] in Germany during the early 20th century. Notions of white supremacy and Aryan racial superiority combined in the 19th century, with white supremacists maintaining that white people were members of an Aryan "master race" which is superior to other races, and particularly the [[Jews]] described as the "Semitic race", [[Slavs]] and [[Gypsy (term)|Gypsies]], which they associated with "cultural sterility". [[Arthur de Gobineau]], a French racial theorist and aristocrat, blamed the fall of the ancient régime in France on racial degeneracy caused by racial intermixing, which he argued destroyed the purity of the Aryan race. Gobineau's theories, which attracted a strong following in Germany, emphasized the existence of an irreconcilable polarity between Aryan and Jewish cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Blamires, Cyprian; Jackson, Paul. World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia: Volume 1. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, Inc, 2006. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to preserve the Aryan race, the Nazis introduced in 1935 the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg racial laws]] which forbade sexual relations and marriages between Aryans and non-Aryans.

Nazis used the [[Mendelian inheritance]] theory to demonstrate the inheritance of social traits, claiming a racial nature of certain general traits such as inventiveness or criminal behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Friedlander. The Origins of Nazi Genocide: From Euthanasia to the Final Solution. Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA: University of North Carolina Press, 1995. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the modern-day white supremacist groups around the world re-use German [[Nazi symbolism]], including the [[swastika]], to represent their beliefs.

According to the annual report of Germany's interior intelligence service ([[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution|Verfassungsschutz]]) for 2012, at the time there were 26,000 right-wing extremists living in Germany, including 6000 neo-Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.verfassungsschutz.de/de/oeffentlichkeitsarbeit/publikationen/verfassungsschutzberichte/vsbericht-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
White supremacy was also dominant in South Africa under [[apartheid]], which it maintained until 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = abolition of the White Australia Policy |url = http://www.immi.gov.au/media/fact-sheets/08abolition.htm | publisher = Australian Government | date= November 2010 | accessdate =October 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.britannica.com.ezproxy.csu.edu.au/EBchecked/topic/555568/South-Africa/259494/The-apartheid-years | title = Encyclopaedia Britannia, South Africa the Apartheid Years | publisher = Encyclopaedia Britannia | accessdate = October 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic use of the term==
The term ''white supremacy'' is used in academic studies of racial power to denote a system of structural or [[societal racism]] which privileges white people over others, regardless of the presence or absence of racial hatred. Legal scholar Frances Lee Ansley explains this definition as follows:
:By "white supremacy" I do not mean to allude only to the self-conscious racism of white supremacist [[hate group]]s. I refer instead to a political, economic and cultural system in which whites overwhelmingly control power and material resources, conscious and unconscious ideas of white superiority and entitlement are widespread, and relations of white dominance and non-white subordination are daily reenacted across a broad array of institutions and social settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ansley|first=Frances Lee|title=Stirring the Ashes: Race, Class and the Future of Civil Rights Scholarship|journal=Cornell Law Review|year=1989|volume=74|pages=993ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Temple University Press | isbn = 978-1-56639-532-8 | editors = Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic (eds.) | last = Ansley | first = Frances Lee | title = Critical white studies: Looking behind the mirror | chapter = White supremacy (and what we should do about it) | date = 1997-06-29 | page = 592 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This and similar definitions are adopted or proposed by Charles Mills,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pages = 35–48 | last = Mills | first = C.W. | title = White supremacy as sociopolitical system: A philosophical perspective | journal = White out: The continuing significance of racism | year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[bell hooks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Pluto Press | isbn = 978-0-7453-1663-5 | last = Hooks | first = Bell | title = Feminist theory: From margin to center | date = 200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; David Gillborn,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/1468796806068323 | issn = 1468-7968 | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 318–340 | last = Gillborn | first = David | title = Rethinking White Supremacy Who Counts in ‘WhiteWorld’ | journal = Ethnicities | accessdate = 2012-03-14 | date = 2006-09-01 | url = http://etn.sagepub.com/content/6/3/318 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Neely Fuller Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = SAGE | asin = B0007BLCWC | last = Fuller | first = Neely | title = The united-independent compensatory code/system/concept: A textbook/workbook for thought, speech, and/or action, for victims of racism (white supremacy) | year = 1984 | page = 334 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[anti-racism|anti-racist]] educators, such as Betita Martinez and the Challenging White Supremacy workshop, also use the term in this way. The term expresses historic continuities between a pre-[[Civil Rights movement|Civil Rights]] era of open white supremacism and the current racial power structure of the United States. It also expresses the visceral impact of structural racism through "provocative and brutal" language that characterizes racism as "nefarious, global, systemic, and constant."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis US | isbn = 978-0-415-98980-0 | editors = Jeanette Davidson and George Yancy (eds.) | last = Davidson | first = Tim | title = Critical perspectives on Bell Hooks | chapter = bell hooks, white supremacy, and the academy | date = 2009-02-23 | page = 68 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic users of the term sometimes prefer it to ''racism'' because it allows for a disconnection between racist feelings and white racial advantage or [[white privilege|privilege]].&lt;ref&gt;"Why is it so difficult for many white folks to understand that racism is oppressive not because white folks have prejudicial feelings about blacks (they could have such feelings and leave us alone) but because it is a system that promotes domination and subjugation?" {{Cite book | publisher = Turnaround Publisher Services Limited | isbn = 978-1-873262-02-3 | last = hooks | first = bell | title = Black Looks: Race and Representation | date = 2009-02-04 | page = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grillo and Wildman cite hooks to argue for the term ''racism/white supremacy'': "hooks writes that liberal whites do not see themselves as prejudiced or interested in domination through coercion, and do not acknowledge the ways they the ways they contribute to and benefit from the system of white privilege." {{Cite book | publisher = Temple University Press | isbn = 978-1-56639-532-8 | editors = Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic (eds.) | last1 = Grillo | first1 = Trina |author2= Stephanie M. Wildman | title = Critical white studies: Looking behind the mirror | chapter = The implications of making comparisons between racism and sexism (or other isms) | date = 1997-06-29 | page = 620 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideologies and movements==
Supporters of [[Nordicism]] consider the Nordic peoples to be a superior race considering all non-Nordic people, in particular [[Jews]], [[Romani people|Gypsies]], [[Arab people|Arabs]], [[black people]], [[brown (racial classification)|brown people]], East Asian people, [[Malay race]] people, and [[multiracial|mixed-race]] people to be inferior to the [[master race]]. By the early-19th century white supremacy was attached to emerging theories of racial hierarchy. The German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] attributed civilisational primacy to the White race:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The [[eugenics|eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]] argued that the Nordic race had been responsible for most of humanity's great achievements, and that admixture was "race suicide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

''The Passing of the Great Race''. Charles Scribner's Sons, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) is the group most associated with the white supremacist movement. Many white supremacist groups are based on the concept of preserving genetic purity, and they do not focus solely on [[discrimination]] by skin color.&lt;ref name="law.jrank.org"&gt;http://law.jrank.org/pages/11302/White-Supremacy-Groups.html White Supremacy Groups&lt;/ref&gt; The KKK's reasons for supporting [[racial segregation]] are not primarily based on religious ideals, but some Klan groups are openly [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. The KKK and other white supremacist groups like [[Aryan Nations]], [[The Order (group)|The Order]] and the [[White Patriot Party]] are considered [[Anti-Semitism|Anti-Semitic]].&lt;ref name="law.jrank.org"/&gt;

[[Nazi Germany]] promulgated white supremacy in the belief that the [[Aryan race]] was the ''[[master race]]''. It was combined with a [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics programme]] that aimed for [[racial hygiene]] by using compulsory sterilizations and extermination of the [[Untermenschen]] (or "sub-humans"), which eventually culminated in the [[Holocaust]].

[[Christian Identity]] is another movement closely tied to white supremacy. Some white supremacists identify themselves as [[Ásatrú|Odinists]], although many Odinists reject white supremacy. Some white supremacist groups, such as the [[South Africa]]n [[Boeremag]], conflate elements of [[Christianity]] and Odinism. The World Church of the Creator (now called the [[Creativity Movement]]) is [[atheistic]] and it denounces the Christian religion and other [[theistic]] religions.&lt;ref name="Atheistic"&gt;{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=HB1wyFPRGm4C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=atheism+white+supremacy#v=onepage&amp;q=atheistic&amp;f=false|title =The new white nationalism in America: its challenge to integration|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|quote=For instance, Ben Klassen, founder of the atheistic World Church of the Creator and the author of ''The White Man's Bible'', discusses Christianity extensively in his writings and denounces religion that has brought untold horror into the world and divided the white race.|accessdate = 2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atheism"&gt;{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=rBgn3xB75ZcC&amp;pg=PA493&amp;dq=competing+atheistic+white+racist+movement#v=onepage&amp;q=competing%20atheistic%20white%20racist%20movement&amp;f=false|title =The World's Religions: Continuities and Transformations|publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|quote=A competing atheistic or panthestic white racist movement also appeared, which included the Church of the Creator/ Creativity (Gardell 2003: 129–134).|accessdate = 2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from this, its ideology is similar to many Christian Identity groups, in their belief that there is a [[Jewish conspiracy]] in control of governments, the banking industry and the media. [[Matthew F. Hale]], founder of the World Church of the Creator has published articles stating that all races other than white are "mud races," which the religion teaches.&lt;ref name="law.jrank.org"/&gt;

The white supremacist ideology has become associated with a [[racism|racist]] faction of the [[skinhead]] [[subculture]], despite the fact that when the skinhead culture first developed in the [[United Kingdom]] in the late 1960s, it was heavily influenced by [[black]] fashions and music, especially [[Jamaica]]n [[reggae]] and [[ska]], and [[African American]] [[soul music]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback |date=20010219175613 |url=ska.about.com/musicperform/ska/library/1999/aa081699a.htm |title=Smiling Smash: An Interview with Cathal Smyth, a.k.a.

White supremacist recruitment activities are conducted primarily at a [[grassroots]] level and on the Internet. Widespread access to the Internet has led to a dramatic increase in white supremacist websites.&lt;ref name="Adversity"&gt;{{cite web |last=1Adams |first1=Josh |first2=Vincent J. |last2=Roscigno |title=White Supremacists, Oppositional Culture and the World Wide Web |work=University on North Carolina Press 84 (2005): 759-788 |date=20 November 2009 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3598477}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet provides a venue to openly express white supremacist ideas at little [[social cost]], because people who post the information are able to remain anonymous.

==Alliances with black supremacist groups==

In February 1962 [[George Lincoln Rockwell]], the leader of the [[American Nazi Party]], spoke at a [[Nation of Islam]] rally in Chicago, where he was applauded by [[Elijah Muhammed]] as he pronounced: "I am proud to stand here before black men.  I believe Elijah Muhammed is the Adolf Hitler of the black man!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Thayer|title=The Farther Shore of Politics: The American Political Fringe Today|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3EEGAAAAMAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Allen Lane|pages=25–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rockwell had attended, but did not speak at, an earlier NOI rally in June 1961 in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=gardell&gt;{{cite book|author=Mattias Gardell|title=In the Name of Elijah Muhammad: Louis Farrakhan and The Nation of Islam|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Z9ufS6aXctQC&amp;pg=PA273|date=7 October 1996|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-1845-8|pages=273–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even once donated $20 to the NOI.&lt;ref name=voice&gt;{{cite news|title=White Supremacists Voice Support of Farrakhan|author=Wayne King|work=New York Times|date=October 12, 1985|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, after breaking with the Nation of Islam and denouncing its separatist doctrine, [[Malcolm X]] told his followers that the Nation of Islam under Elijah Muhammad had made secret agreements with the American Nazi Party and the Ku Klux Klan.&lt;ref name=gardell/&gt;

Rockwell and other white supremacists (e.g. [[Willis Carto]]) also supported less well-known black supremacist groups, such as [[Hassan Jeru-Ahmed]]'s [[Blackman's Army of Liberation]], in reference to which Rockwell told ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reporter [[Michael Drosnin]] in 1967 that "Any Negro wants to go back to Africa, I'll carry him piggy-back."&lt;ref name=drosnin&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Negro Group Plans Own Nation in Africa: 'Blackman's Army'|author=Michael Drosnin|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 5, 1967|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, [[Tom Metzger (white supremacist)|Tom Metzger]], erstwhile [[Ku Klux Klan]] leader from California, spoke at an NOI rally in [[Los Angeles]] in September 1985 and donated $100 to the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bedfellows: The Klan Connection|work=New York Times|date=October 6, 1985|page=E20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October of that same year a collection of over 200 prominent white supremacists met at former Klan leader [[Robert E. Miles]]'s farm to discuss an alliance with [[Louis Farrakhan]], head of the NOI.&lt;ref name=voice/&gt;  In attendance were [[Edward Reed Fields]] of the [[National States' Rights Party]], [[Richard Girnt Butler]] of [[Aryan Nations]], [[Don Black (white nationalist)|Don Black]], [[Roy Frankhouser]], and Metzger, who said that "America is like a rotting carcass.  The Jews are living off the carcass like the parasites they are.  Farrakhan understands this."&lt;ref name=voice/&gt;
