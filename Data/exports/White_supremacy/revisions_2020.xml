{{short description|Racist belief in the superiority of white people}}{{Discrimination sidebar}}

'''White supremacy''' is the belief that [[white people]] are superior to those of other [[Race (human classification)|races]] and thus should dominate them. Its purpose is the maintenance and defense of a system of wealth, power, and privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Martinez|first=Elizabeth|date=|title=What is white supremacy?|url=http://www.pym.org/annual-sessions/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/06/What_Is_White_Supremacy_Martinez.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 11, 2020|website=pym.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; White supremacy has roots in the now-discredited doctrine of [[scientific racism]], and was a key justification for [[colonialism]]. It underlies a spectrum of contemporary movements including [[Neo-Confederate|neo-Confederates]], [[neo-Nazism]] and [[Christian Identity]].

Different forms of white supremacy put forth different conceptions of who is considered white (though the exemplar is generally light-skinned, blond-haired, and blue-eyed, or [[Aryan race|'Aryan']] traits most common in northern Europe), and groups of white supremacists identify various racial and ethnic  enemies, most commonly those of [[African diaspora|African ancestry]], [[Indigenous peoples]] of the Americas and Australia, and [[Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flint|first=Colin|title=Spaces of Hate: Geographies of Discrimination and Intolerance in the U.S.A.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-0-415-93586-9|location=|page=53|quote=Although white racist activists must adopt a political identity of whiteness, the flimsy definition of whiteness in modern culture poses special challenges for them.

As a [[political ideology]], it imposes and maintains [[Color line (racism)|social]], [[Racial segregation|political]], [[historical revisionism|historical]], or [[institutional racism|institutional]] domination by white people. This ideology has been put into effect through socioeconomic and legal structures such as the [[Atlantic slave trade]], [[Jim Crow laws]] in the [[United States]], the [[White Australia]] policies from the 1890s to the mid-1970s, and ''[[apartheid]]'' in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Privilege Revealed: How Invisible Preference Undermines America |url=https://archive.org/details/privilegereveale00wild |url-access=registration |last=Wildman |first=Stephanie M. |authorlink= |year=1996 |publisher=NYU Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8147-9303-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/privilegereveale00wild/page/87 87]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Helms 2016 6–7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Helms|first=Janet|date=2016|title=An election to save White Heterosexual Male Privilege|url=|journal=Latina/o Psychology Today|volume=3|pages=6–7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, this ideology is embodied in the "White power" social movement. Since the early 1980s, the White power movement has been committed to overthrowing the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] and establishing a white homeland using paramilitary tactics. 

In academic usage, particularly in [[critical race theory]] or [[intersectionality]], "white supremacy" can also refer to a social system in which white people enjoy structural advantages ([[Privilege (social inequality)|privilege]]) over other ethnic groups, on both a collective and individual level, despite formal legal equality.

==History==
White supremacy has ideological foundations that date back to 17th-century [[scientific racism]], the predominant paradigm of human variation that helped shape international relations and racial policy from the latter part of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] until the late 20th century (marked by decolonization and the abolition of [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]] in 1991, followed by that country's [[South African general election, 1994|first multiracial elections in 1994]]).

Some academics argue that outcomes from the [[2016 United States Presidential Election]] reflect ongoing challenges with white supremacy.

On July 23, 2019, [[Christopher A. Wray]], the head of the [[FBI]], said at a [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] hearing that the agency had made around 100 [[domestic terrorism]] arrests since October 1, 2018, and that the majority of them were connected in some way with white supremacy. Wray said that the Bureau was "aggressively pursuing [domestic terrorism] using both counterterrorism resources and criminal investigative resources and partnering closely with our state and local partners," but said that it was focused on the violence itself and not on its ideological basis. A similar number of arrests had been made for instances of international terrorism. In the past, Wray has said that white supremacy was a significant and "pervasive" threat to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Chalfant, Morgan (July 23, 2019) [https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/454338-fbis-wray-says-majority-of-domestic-terrorism-arrests-this-year "FBI's Wray says most domestic terrorism arrests this year involve white supremacy"] ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, 2019, the acting [[Secretary of Homeland Security]], [[Kevin McAleenan]], announced his department's revised strategy for counter-terrorism, which included a new emphasis on the dangers inherent in the white supremacy movement.  McAleenan called white supremacy one of the most "potent ideologies" behind domestic terrorism-related violent acts. In a speech at the [[Brookings Institution]], McAleenan cited a series of high-profile shooting incidents, and said "In our modern age, the continued menace of racially based violent extremism, particularly white supremacist extremism, is an abhorrent affront to the nation, the struggle and unity of its diverse population." The new strategy will include better tracking and analysis of threats, sharing information with local officials, training local law enforcement on how to deal with shooting events, discouraging the hosting of hate sites online, and encouraging counter-messages.&lt;ref&gt;Sands, Geneva (September 20, 2019) [https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/20/politics/dhs-counterterrorism-strategy/index.html "Homeland Security counterterrorism strategy focuses on white supremacy threat"] ''[[CNN]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Pete (September 20, 2019) [https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/department-homeland-security-strategy-adds-white-supremacy-list-threats-n1057136 "Department of Homeland Security strategy adds white supremacy to list of threats"] ''[[NBC News]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effect of the media====
White supremacy has been depicted in [[music video]]s, [[feature film]]s, [[documentary film|documentaries]], journal entries, and on [[social media]]. The 1915 silent drama film ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' followed the rising racial, economic, political, and geographic tensions leading up to the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and the Southern [[Reconstruction era]] that was the genesis of the Ku Klux Klan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://themovingarts.com/revered-and-reviled-d-w-griffiths-the-birth-of-a-nation/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529224316/http://themovingarts.com/revered-and-reviled-d-w-griffiths-the-birth-of-a-nation/|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 29, 2010|title=Revered and Reviled: D.W.

[[David Duke]], a former [[Grand Wizard]] of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], believed that the [[Internet]] was going to create a "chain reaction of racial enlightenment that will shake the world." Jessie Daniels, of [[Hunter College|CUNY-Hunter College]], also said that racist groups see the Internet as a way to spread their ideologies, influence others and gain supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Daniel|first=Jessie|url=https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1371&amp;context=hc_pubs|title=Twitter and White Supremacy: A Love Story|date=October 19, 2017|website=[[CUNY|CUNY Academic Works]]|access-date=December 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal scholar [[Richard Hasen]] describes a "dark side" of [[social media]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There certainly were [[hate group]]s before the Internet and [[social media]]. [But with social media] it just becomes easier to organize, to spread the word, for people to know where to go. It could be to raise money, or it could be to engage in attacks on social media. Some of the activity is virtual. Some of it is in a physical place. Social media has lowered the collective-action problems that individuals who might want to be in a hate group would face. You can see that there are people out there like you. That's the dark side of social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://psmag.com/social-justice/how-social-media-helped-organize-and-radicalize-americas-newest-white-supremacists|title=How Social Media Helped Organize and Radicalize America's White Supremacists|last=Diep|first=Francie|website=[[Pacific Standard]]|access-date=December 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With the emergence of [[Twitter]] in 2006, and platforms such as ''[[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]]'' which was launched in 1996, an [[alt-right]] portal for white supremacists with similar beliefs, both adults and children, was provided in which they were given a way to connect. Daniels discussed the emergence of other social media outlets such as [[4chan]] and [[Reddit]], which meant that the "spread of white nationalist symbols and ideas could be accelerated and amplified." Sociologist [[Kathleen Blee]] notes that the anonymity which the Internet provides can make it difficult to track the extent of white supremacist activity in the country, but nevertheless she and other experts&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/8/6/20754828/el-paso-shooting-white-supremacy-rise ''The El Paso shooting isn't an anomaly.

Why white supremacist violence is rising today — and how it echoes some of the darkest moments of our past'', by Zack Beauchamp, Vox, Aug 6, 2019].&lt;/ref&gt; see an increase in the amount of [[hate crime]]s and white supremacist violence. In the latest wave of white supremacy, in the age of the Internet, Blee sees the movement as having primarily become a virtual one, in which divisions between groups become blurred: "[A]ll these various groups that get jumbled together as the alt-right and people who have come in from the more traditional neo-Nazi world.

===British Commonwealth ===
In 1937, [[Winston Churchill]] told the [[Palestine Royal Commission]]: "I do not admit for instance, that a great wrong has been done to the [[Native Americans in the United States|Red Indians of America]] or the [[Indigenous Australians|black people of Australia]]. I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher-grade race, a more worldly wise race to put it that way, has come in and taken their place." British historian [[Richard Toye]], author of ''Churchill's Empire'', said that "Churchill did think that white people were superior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The 10 greatest controversies of Winston Churchill's career |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29701767 |work=BBC News |date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Africa====
{{see|Apartheid|Baasskap}}
A number of [[Southern Africa]]n nations experienced severe racial tension and conflict during global [[decolonization]], particularly as [[white Africans of European ancestry]] fought to protect their preferential social and political status. Racial segregation in South Africa began in colonial times under the [[Dutch Empire]], and it continued when the British took over the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1795. [[Apartheid]] was introduced as an officially structured policy by the [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]]-dominated [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] after the [[South African general election, 1948|general election of 1948]]. Apartheid's legislation divided inhabitants into four racial groups—"black", "white", "coloured", and "Indian", with coloured divided into several sub-classifications.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin-Ragaven, Laurel; London, Lesley; du Gruchy, Jeanelle (1999).

===Germany===
[[Nazism]] promoted the idea of a superior [[Germanic people]] or [[Aryan race]] in [[Germany]] during the early 20th century. Notions of white supremacy and Aryan racial superiority were combined in the 19th century, with white supremacists maintaining the belief that white people were members of an Aryan "[[master race]]" which was superior to other races, particularly the [[Jews]], who were described as the "Semitic race", [[Slavs]], and [[Names of the Romani people|Gypsies]], which they associated with "cultural sterility". [[Arthur de Gobineau]], a French racial theorist and aristocrat, blamed the fall of the [[Ancien Régime|''ancien régime'']] in France on racial degeneracy caused by racial intermixing, which he argued had destroyed the "purity" of the Nordic or Germanic race. Gobineau's theories, which attracted a strong following in Germany, emphasized the existence of an irreconcilable polarity between Aryan or Germanic peoples and Jewish culture.&lt;ref&gt;Blamires, Cyprian; Jackson, Paul.

As the [[Nazi Party]]'s chief racial theorist, [[Alfred Rosenberg]] oversaw the construction of a human racial "ladder" that justified [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Hitler's racial and ethnic policies]]. Rosenberg promoted the [[Nordic theory]], which regarded [[Nordic race|Nordics]] as the "master race", superior to all others, including other Aryans (Indo-Europeans).&lt;ref&gt;Though Rosenberg does not use the word "master race". He uses the word "Herrenvolk" (i. e., ruling people) twice in his book ''The Myth'', first referring to the [[Amorite]]s (saying that [[Archibald Sayce|Sayce]] described them as fair skinned and blue eyed) and secondly quoting [[Victor Wallace Germains]]' description of the English in "The Truth about Kitchener". ("The Myth of the Twentieth Century") - Pages 26, 660 - 1930&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenberg got the racial term ''[[Untermensch]]'' from the title of [[Klansman]] [[Lothrop Stoddard]]'s 1922 book ''The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under-man''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Stoddard, Lothrop| authorlink = Lothrop Stoddard| year = 1922| title = The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under Man| publisher = [[Charles Scribner's Sons]]| location = New York| isbn =| url = https://archive.org/details/revoltagainstciv00stoduoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later adopted by the Nazis from that book's German version ''Der Kulturumsturz: Die Drohung des Untermenschen'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;

In establishing a restrictive entry system for Germany in 1925, Hitler wrote of his admiration for America's immigration laws: "The American Union categorically refuses the immigration of physically unhealthy elements, and simply excludes the immigration of certain races."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/american-laws-against-coloreds-influenced-nazi-racial-planners/ "American laws against 'coloreds' influenced Nazi racial planners"]. Times of Israel. Retrieved August 26, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

German praise for America's institutional racism, previously found in Hitler's ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', was continuous throughout the early 1930s, and Nazi lawyers were advocates of the use of American models.&lt;ref name="Whitman"/&gt; Race-based U.S. citizenship and anti-miscegenation laws directly inspired the Nazis' two principal [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg racial laws]]—the Citizenship Law and the Blood Law.&lt;ref name="Whitman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitman|first1=James Q.|title=Hitler's American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law|date=2017|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=37–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to preserve the Aryan or [[Nordic race]], the Nazis introduced the Nuremberg Laws in 1935, which forbade sexual relations and marriages between Germans and Jews, and later between Germans and [[Romani people|Romani]] and [[Slavs]]. The Nazis used the [[Mendelian inheritance]] theory to argue that social traits were innate, claiming that there was a racial nature associated with certain general traits such as inventiveness or criminal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Friedlander.

==Academic use of the term==
The term ''white supremacy'' is used in some academic studies of racial power to denote a system of structural or [[societal racism]] which privileges white people over others, regardless of the presence or the absence of racial hatred. White racial advantages occur at both a collective and an individual level (''[[ceteris paribus]]'', {{Nowrap|i. e.}}, when individuals are compared that do not relevantly differ except in ethnicity). Legal scholar Frances Lee Ansley explains this definition as follows:

{{quote|By "white supremacy" I do not mean to allude only to the self-conscious racism of white supremacist [[hate group]]s. I refer instead to a political, economic and cultural system in which whites overwhelmingly control power and material resources, conscious and unconscious ideas of white superiority and entitlement are widespread, and relations of white dominance and non-white subordination are daily reenacted across a broad array of institutions and social settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ansley|first=Frances Lee|title=Stirring the Ashes: Race, Class and the Future of Civil Rights Scholarship|journal=Cornell Law Review|year=1989|volume=74|pages=993ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Temple University Press | isbn = 978-1-56639-532-8 | editor1 = Richard Delgado |editor2= Jean Stefancic | last = Ansley | first = Frances Lee | title = Critical white studies: Looking behind the mirror | chapter = White supremacy (and what we should do about it) | date = 1997-06-29 | page = 592}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some [[anti-racism|anti-racist]] educators, such as Betita Martinez and the Challenging White Supremacy workshop, also use the term in this way. The term expresses historic continuities between a pre–[[civil rights movement]] era of open white supremacy and the current racial power structure of the United States. It also expresses the visceral impact of structural racism through "provocative and brutal" language that characterizes racism as "nefarious, global, systemic, and constant".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis US | isbn = 978-0-415-98980-0 | editor1 = Jeanette Davidson | editor2 = George Yancy | last = Davidson | first = Tim | title = Critical perspectives on Bell Hooks | chapter = bell hooks, white supremacy, and the academy | date = 2009-02-23 | page = 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic users of the term sometimes prefer it to ''racism'' because it allows for a distinction to be drawn between racist feelings and white racial advantage or [[white privilege|privilege]].&lt;ref&gt;"Why is it so difficult for many white folks to understand that racism is oppressive not because white folks have prejudicial feelings about blacks (they could have such feelings and leave us alone) but because it is a system that promotes domination and subjugation?" {{Cite book | publisher = Turnaround Publisher Services Limited | isbn = 978-1-873262-02-3 | last = hooks | first = bell | title = Black Looks: Race and Representation | date = 2009-02-04 | page = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grillo and Wildman cite hooks to argue for the term ''racism/white supremacy'': "hooks writes that liberal whites do not see themselves as either prejudiced or interested in domination through coercion, and they do not acknowledge the ways in which they contribute to and benefit from the system of white privilege." {{Cite book | publisher = Temple University Press | isbn = 978-1-56639-532-8 | editor1 = Richard Delgado | editor2 = Jean Stefancic | last1 = Grillo | first1 = Trina |author2= Stephanie M.

The term's recent rise in popularity among [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] activists has been characterized by some as counterproductive. John McWhorter has described the use of "white supremacy" as straying from its commonly accepted meaning to encompass less extreme issues, thereby cheapening the term and potentially derailing productive discussion.&lt;ref name="left language"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/left-language-right-language/|title=Left Language, Right Language|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McWhorter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4584161/white-supremacy/|title=The Difference Between Racial Bias and White Supremacy|website=TIME |last1=McWhorter|first1=John|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political columnist [[Kevin Drum]] attributes the term's growing popularity to frequent use by [[Ta-Nehisi Coates]], describing it as a "terrible fad" which fails to convey nuance. He claims that the term should be reserved for those who are trying to promote the idea that whites are inherently superior to blacks and not used to characterize less blatantly racist beliefs or actions.&lt;ref name="MotherJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/11/lets-please-kill-white-supremacy-fad|title=Let's Be Careful With the "White Supremacy" Label|website=Mother Jones|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedersdorf"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/the-scourge-of-the-left-too-much-stigma-not-enough-persuasion/508961/|title='The Scourge of the Left': Too Much Stigma, Not Enough Persuasion|last=Friedersdorf|first=Conor|access-date=2016-12-04|language=en-US|newspaper=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the academic definition of white supremacy has been criticized by Conor Friedersdorf for the confusion it creates for the general public inasmuch as it differs from the more common dictionary definition; he argues that it is likely to alienate those it hopes to convince.&lt;ref name="Friedersdorf" /&gt;

==Ideologies and movements==
Supporters of [[Nordic race#Nordicism|Nordicism]] consider the "Nordic peoples" to be a superior race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nordicism|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nordicism|website=Merriam Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 19th century, white supremacy was attached to emerging theories of racial hierarchy. The German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] attributed cultural primacy to the white race:

{{quote|The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the [[Brahman]]s, the [[Inca Empire|Incas]], and the rulers of the [[Polynesia|South Sea Islands]]. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | authorlink = Arthur Schopenhauer | title = ''Parerga and Paralipomena'' | year = 1851 | pages = Vol. 2, Section 92| title-link = Parerga and Paralipomena }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Good Citizen Pillar of Fire Church July 1926.jpg|thumb|''[[The Good Citizen]]'' 1926, published by [[Pillar of Fire International|Pillar of Fire Church]]]]

The [[eugenics|eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]] argued in his 1916 book, ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'', that the Nordic race had been responsible for most of humanity's great achievements, and that [[Miscegenation|admixture]] was "race suicide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Grant | first = Madison | title = The Passing of the Great Race | publisher = C.

[[File:Klan-in-gainesville.jpg|thumb|left|267px|Members of the second [[Ku Klux Klan]] at a rally in 1923.]]

In the United States, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) is the group most associated with the white supremacist movement. Many white supremacist groups are based on the concept of preserving genetic purity, and do not focus solely on [[discrimination]] based on skin color.&lt;ref name="law.jrank.org"&gt;{{citation|url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/11302/White-Supremacy-Groups.html |title=White Supremacy Groups |work=Law Library - American Law and Legal Information |publisher=Net Industries and its Licensors|date=2019| access-date=15 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KKK's reasons for supporting [[racial segregation]] are not primarily based on religious ideals, but some Klan groups are openly [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. The KKK and other white supremacist groups like [[Aryan Nations]], [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]] and the [[White Patriot Party]] are considered [[Antisemitism in the United States|antisemitic]].&lt;ref name="law.jrank.org"/&gt;

[[Nazi Germany]] promulgated white supremacy based on the belief that the [[Aryan race]], or the Germans, were the ''[[master race]]''. It was combined with a [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics programme]] that aimed for [[racial hygiene]] through compulsory sterilization of sick individuals and extermination of [[Untermensch]]en ("subhumans"): [[Anti-Slavic sentiment|Slavs]], Jews and [[antiziganism|Romani]], which eventually culminated in [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;Gumkowski, Janusz; Leszczynski, Kazimierz; Robert, Edward (translator) (1961).

[[Christian Identity]] is another movement closely tied to white supremacy. Some white supremacists identify themselves as [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Odinists]], although many Odinists reject white supremacy. Some white supremacist groups, such as the [[South Africa]]n [[Boeremag]], conflate elements of [[Christianity]] and Odinism. [[Creativity (religion)|Creativity]] (formerly known as "The World Church of the Creator") is [[atheism|atheistic]] and it denounces Christianity and other [[Theism|theistic religions]].&lt;ref name="Atheistic"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HB1wyFPRGm4C&amp;q=atheistic&amp;pg=PA23|title =The new white nationalism in America: its challenge to integration|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|quote=For instance, Ben Klassen, founder of the atheistic Church of the Creator and author of ''The White Man's Bible'', discusses Christianity extensively in his writings and denounces it as a religion that has brought untold horror into the world and has divided the white race.|accessdate = 2011-03-27|isbn =9780521808866|date =2002-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atheism"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rBgn3xB75ZcC&amp;q=competing+atheistic+white+racist+movement&amp;pg=PA493|title =The World's Religions: Continuities and Transformations|publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|quote=A competing atheistic or panthestic white racist movement also appeared, which included the Church of the Creator/ Creativity (Gardell 2003: 129–34).|accessdate = 2011-03-27|isbn =9781135211004|date =2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from this, its ideology is similar to that of many Christian Identity groups because it believes in the [[List of conspiracy theories#Antisemitic conspiracy theories|antisemitic conspiracy theory]] that there is a "Jewish conspiracy" in control of governments, the banking industry and the media. [[Matthew F. Hale]], founder of the World Church of the Creator, has published articles stating that all races other than white are "mud races", which is what the group's religion teaches.&lt;ref name="law.jrank.org"/&gt;

The white supremacist ideology has become associated with a racist faction of the [[skinhead]] [[subculture]], despite the fact that when the skinhead culture first developed in the United Kingdom in the late 1960s, it was heavily influenced by black fashions and [[Black music|music]], especially Jamaican [[reggae]] and [[ska]], and African American [[soul music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ska.about.com/musicperform/ska/library/1999/aa081699a.htm |title=Smiling Smash: An Interview with Cathal Smyth, a.k.a.

White supremacist recruitment activities are primarily conducted at a [[grassroots]] level as well as on the [[Internet]]. Widespread access to the Internet has led to a dramatic increase in white supremacist websites.&lt;ref name="Adversity"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Adams |first1=Josh |first2=Vincent J. |last2=Roscigno |title=White Supremacists, Oppositional Culture and the World Wide Web |journal=University on North Carolina Press 84 (2005): 759–88 |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=759–778 |date=20 November 2009 |jstor=3598477}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet provides a venue to openly express white supremacist ideas at little [[social cost]], because people who post the information are able to remain anonymous.

=== White separatism ===
{{anchor|White separatism}}
White [[separatism]] is a political and social movement that seeks the separation of [[white people]] from people of other [[race (human categorization)|races]] and [[ethnicity|ethnicities]], the establishment of a [[white ethnostate]] by removing non-whites from existing communities or by forming new communities elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3719/is_200607/ai_n16855771/pg_9/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203033702/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3719/is_200607/ai_n16855771/pg_9 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-12-03 |title=The Strategy of White Separatism |journal=Journal of Political and Military Sociology |date=Summer 2006 |last1=Dobratz |first1=Betty A. |last2=Shanks-Meile |first2=Stephanie L. |name-list-style=amp|volume=34 |number=1 |pages=49–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern researchers do not view white separatism as distinct from white supremacist beliefs. The [[Anti-Defamation League]] defines white separatism as "a form of white supremacy";&lt;ref name="ADL"&gt;{{cite web |title=White Separatism |url=https://www.adl.org/resources/glossary-terms/white-separatism |publisher=ADL}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Southern Poverty Law Center defines both white nationalism and white separatism as "ideologies based on white supremacy."&lt;ref name="SPLC"&gt;{{cite web |title=SPLC reacts to Facebook policy on white nationalism |url=https://www.splcenter.org/news/2019/03/27/splc-reacts-facebook-policy-white-nationalism |publisher=SPLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook has banned content that is openly [[white nationalism|white nationalist]] or white separatist because "white nationalism and white separatism cannot be meaningfully separated from white supremacy and organized hate groups".&lt;ref name="Facebook"&gt;{{cite web |title=Standing Against Hate |url=https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/03/standing-against-hate/ |publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Facebook to ban white nationalism and separatism |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47728471 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the term to self-identify has been criticized as a dishonest rhetorical ploy. The Anti-Defamation League argues that white supremacists use the phrase because they believe it has fewer negative connotations than the term ''white supremacist''.&lt;ref name="ADL_def"&gt;{{cite web |title=ADL: White Separatism |url=https://www.adl.org/resources/glossary-terms/white-separatism |website=adl.org |publisher=The Anti-Defamation League |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobratz &amp; Shanks-Meile reported that adherents usually reject [[Interracial marriage|marriage "outside the white race"]]. They argued the existence of "a distinction between the white supremacist's desire to dominate (as in [[apartheid]], [[slavery]], or [[Racial segregation|segregation]]) and complete separation by race".&lt;ref&gt;Dobratz, Betty A. &amp; Shanks-Meile, Stephanie L. (2000) ''The White Separatist Movement in the United States: "White Power, White Pride!''. Baltimore: JHU Press. pp.vii, 10&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that this is a matter of pragmatism, that while many white supremacists are also white separatists, contemporary white separatists reject the view that returning to a system of segregation is possible or desirable in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Dobratz |first1=Betty A. |last2=Shanks-Meile |first2=Stephanie L. |name-list-style=amp|year=1997 |title=The White Separatist Movement in the United States: White Power, White Pride! |location=New York |publisher=Twayne Publishers |isbn=9780805738650 |oclc=37341476 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r59bGyH4lOAC|pages=ix,12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political violence ==
The [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Institute]] has estimated that 3,446 blacks were the victims of [[lynchings in the United States]] between 1882 and 1968, with the peak occurring in the 1890s at a time of economic stress in the South and increasing political suppression of blacks. If 1,297 whites were also lynched during this period, blacks were disproportionally targeted, representing 72.7% of all people lynched.&lt;ref name="tuskegee_umkc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lynchings: By State and Race, 1882–1968|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/lynchingsstate.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629081241/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/lynchingsstate.html|archivedate=2010-06-29|accessdate=2010-07-26|publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law|quote=Statistics provided by the Archives at Tuskegee Institute.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=History of Lynchings|url=https://www.naacp.org/history-of-lynchings/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-07-01|website=NAACP|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to scholar Amy L.
