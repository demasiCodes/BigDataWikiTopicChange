'''White supremacy''' or '''white supremacism''' is the belief that [[white people]] are superior to those of other [[Race (human classification)|races]] and thus should dominate them. The belief favors the maintenance and defense of any [[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[White privilege|privilege]] held by white people. White supremacy has roots in the [[Pseudoscience|now-discredited]] doctrine of [[scientific racism]] and was a key justification for [[European colonialism]]. It underlies a spectrum of contemporary movements including [[neo-Confederate]]s, [[neo-Nazism]] and [[Christian Identity|the so-called Christian Identity movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Brody |first1=Richard |author1-link=Richard Brody |title="Exterminate All the Brutes," Reviewed: A Vast, Agonizing History of White Supremacy |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/exterminate-all-the-brutes-reviewed-a-vast-agonizing-history-of-white-supremacy |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |access-date=May 21, 2021 |date=April 9, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different forms of white supremacy put forth different conceptions of who is considered 'white', though the exemplar is generally light-skinned, blond-haired, and blue-eyed—[[Aryan race|'Aryan']] traits most common in northern Europe. Different groups of white supremacists identify various racial, ethnic and religious enemies, most commonly those of [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub-Saharan African]] ancestry, [[Indigenous peoples]] of the Americas and Oceania, [[Asian people|Asians]], [[multiracial people]], [[Ethnic groups in the Middle East|Middle Eastern people]], [[Jews]], [[Muslims]], [[Hindus]] and [[Sikhs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flint|first=Colin|title=Spaces of Hate: Geographies of Discrimination and Intolerance in the U.S.A.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-0-415-93586-9|page=53|quote=Although white racist activists must adopt a political identity of whiteness, the flimsy definition of whiteness in modern culture poses special challenges for them.

As a [[Ideology|political ideology]], it imposes and maintains [[Color line (racism)|social]], [[Racial segregation|political]], [[Pseudohistory|historical]], or [[institutional racism|institutional]] domination by white people. This ideology has been put into effect through socioeconomic and legal structures such as the [[Atlantic slave trade]], [[Jim Crow laws]] in the United States, the [[White Australia policy|White Australia policies]] from the 1890s to the mid-1970s, and ''[[apartheid]]'' in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Privilege Revealed: How Invisible Preference Undermines America |url=https://archive.org/details/privilegereveale00wild |url-access=registration |last=Wildman |first=Stephanie M. |year=1996 |publisher=NYU Press |isbn=978-0-8147-9303-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/privilegereveale00wild/page/87 87]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Helms 2016 6–7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Helms|first=Janet|date=2016|title=An election to save White Heterosexual Male Privilege|journal=Latina/o Psychology Today|volume=3|pages=6–7|url=https://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/schools/lsoe_sites/isprc/pdf/Helms%20LPT%202016%20(1).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, this ideology is embodied in the "[[White-Power|White power]]" social movement. Since the early 1980s, the White power movement has been committed to overthrowing the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] and establishing a [[White ethnostate|white ethnostate]] using [[Paramilitary|paramilitary tactics]].&lt;ref name=belew /&gt; 

In academic usage, particularly in [[critical race theory]] or [[intersectionality]], "white supremacy" can also refer to a social system in which white people enjoy structural advantages ([[Privilege (social inequality)|privilege]]) over other ethnic groups, on both a collective and individual level, despite formal legal equality.

==History==
White supremacy has ideological foundations that date back to 17th-century [[scientific racism]], the predominant paradigm of human variation that helped shape international relations and racial policy from the latter part of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] until the late 20th century (marked by decolonization and the abolition of [[apartheid]] in South Africa in 1991, followed by that country's [[South African general election, 1994|first multiracial elections in 1994]]).

In a 2020 article in ''The New York Times'' titled "How White Women Use Themselves as Instruments of Terror", black columnist [[Charles M.

{{Quote|We often like to make white supremacy a testosterone-fueled masculine expression, but it is just as likely to wear heels as a hood. Indeed, untold numbers of lynchings were executed because white women had claimed that a black man raped, assaulted, talked to or glanced at them. The [[Tulsa race massacre]], the destruction of Black Wall Street, was spurred by an incident between a white female elevator operator and a black man. 
As the Oklahoma Historical Society points out, the most common explanation is that he stepped on her toe. As many as 300 people were killed because of it. The torture and murder of 14-year-old [[Emmett Till]] in 1955, a lynching actually, occurred because a white woman said that he "grabbed her and was menacing and sexually crude toward her". This practice, this exercise in racial extremism has been dragged into the modern era through the weaponizing of 9-1-1, often by white women, to invoke the power and force of the police who they are fully aware are hostile to black men. This was again evident when a [[Central Park birdwatching incident|white woman in New York's Central Park]] told a black man, a bird-watcher, that she was going to call the police and tell them that he was threatening her life.}}

[[ISSN (identifier)|ISSN]] 0022-2984.&lt;/ref&gt; She writes that this masternarrative condenses history into only history that is relevant to, and to some extent beneficial for, White Americans.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

====Effect of the media====
White supremacy has been depicted in music videos, feature films, documentaries, journal entries, and on social media. The 1915 silent drama film ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' followed the rising racial, economic, political, and geographic tensions leading up to the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and the Southern [[Reconstruction era]] that was the genesis of the Ku Klux Klan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://themovingarts.com/revered-and-reviled-d-w-griffiths-the-birth-of-a-nation/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529224316/http://themovingarts.com/revered-and-reviled-d-w-griffiths-the-birth-of-a-nation/|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 29, 2010|title=Revered and Reviled: D.W.

[[David Duke]], a former [[Grand Wizard]] of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], believed that the Internet was going to create a "chain reaction of racial enlightenment that will shake the world." Jessie Daniels, of [[Hunter College|CUNY-Hunter College]], also said that racist groups see the Internet as a way to spread their ideologies, influence others and gain supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Daniel|first=Jessie|url=https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1371&amp;context=hc_pubs|title=Twitter and White Supremacy: A Love Story|date=October 19, 2017|website=[[CUNY]] Academic Works|access-date=December 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal scholar [[Richard Hasen]] describes a "dark side" of social media:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There certainly were [[hate group]]s before the Internet and social media. [But with social media] it just becomes easier to organize, to spread the word, for people to know where to go. It could be to raise money, or it could be to engage in attacks on social media. Some of the activity is virtual. Some of it is in a physical place. Social media has lowered the collective-action problems that individuals who might want to be in a hate group would face. You can see that there are people out there like you. That's the dark side of social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://psmag.com/social-justice/how-social-media-helped-organize-and-radicalize-americas-newest-white-supremacists|title=How Social Media Helped Organize and Radicalize America's White Supremacists|last=Diep|first=Francie|website=[[Pacific Standard]]|access-date=December 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With the emergence of Twitter in 2006, and platforms such as ''[[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]]'' which was launched in 1996, an [[alt-right]] portal for white supremacists with similar beliefs, both adults and children, was provided in which they were given a way to connect. Daniels discussed the emergence of other social media outlets such as [[4chan]] and [[Reddit]], which meant that the "spread of white nationalist symbols and ideas could be accelerated and amplified." Sociologist [[Kathleen Blee]] notes that the anonymity which the Internet provides can make it difficult to track the extent of white supremacist activity in the country, but nevertheless she and other experts&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/8/6/20754828/el-paso-shooting-white-supremacy-rise ''The El Paso shooting isn't an anomaly. It's American history repeating itself. Why white supremacist violence is rising today — and how it echoes some of the darkest moments of our past'', by Zack Beauchamp, Vox, Aug 6, 2019].&lt;/ref&gt; see an increase in the amount of [[hate crime]]s and white supremacist violence. In the latest wave of white supremacy, in the age of the Internet, Blee sees the movement as having primarily become a virtual one, in which divisions between groups become blurred: "[A]ll these various groups that get jumbled together as the alt-right and people who have come in from the more traditional neo-Nazi world. We're in a very different world now."&lt;ref&gt;Chow, Kat (December 8, 2018) [https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2018/12/08/671999530/what-the-ebbs-and-flows-of-the-kkk-can-tell-us-about-white-supremacy-today "What The Ebbs And Flows Of The KKK Can Tell Us About White Supremacy Today"] [[NPR]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A series on YouTube hosted by the grandson of [[Thomas Robb (activist)|Thomas Robb]], the national director of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, "presents the Klan's ideology in a format aimed at kids — more specifically, white kids."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/02/the-andrew-show-racist-andrew-pendergraft_n_3536486.html|title='The Andrew Show,' Hosted By Pint-Sized Andrew Pendergraft, Markets Klan's Racist Message To Kids|last=Bennett-Smith|first=Meredith|date=July 2, 2013|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]|access-date=December 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short episodes inveigh against race-mixing, and extol other white supremacist ideologies. A short documentary published by [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation|TRT]] describes Imran Garda's experience, a journalist of Indian descent, who met with Thomas Robb and a traditional KKK group. A sign that greets people who enter the town states "[[White genocide conspiracy theory|Diversity is a code for white genocide]]." The KKK group interviewed in the documentary summarizes its ideals, principles, and beliefs, which are emblematic of white supremacists in the United States. The comic book [[super hero]] [[Captain America]] was used for [[dog whistle politics]] by the alt-right in college campus recruitment in 2017, an ironic co-optation because Captain America battled against Nazis in the comics, and was created by Jewish cartoonists.&lt;ref name="2016 Usage as a racist symbol"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://m.boiseweekly.com/boise/fliers-for-nationalist-organization-appear-at-boise-state/Content?oid=3969556 |title=Fliers For Nationalist Organization Appear at Boise State |last=Harrison |first=Berry |date=January 25, 2017 |publisher=Boise Weekly |access-date=July 18, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404073854/https://m.boiseweekly.com/boise/fliers-for-nationalist-organization-appear-at-boise-state/Content?oid=3969556 |archive-date=April 4, 2019 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ties to 2016 presidential election."&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/education/boise-state-university/article128742204.html |title=BSU nationalist group delays 1st meeting after online pushback, media reports |last=Blanchard |first=Nicole |date=January 26, 2017 |newspaper=Idaho Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Commonwealth ===
{{Further|Racial views of Winston Churchill}}
There has been debate whether [[Winston Churchill]], who was voted "the greatest ever Briton" in 2002, was "a racist and white supremacist".&lt;ref name="Heyden" /&gt; In the context of rejecting the Arab wish to stop [[Aliyah|Jewish immigration]] to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], he said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not admit that the [[The Dog in the Manger|dog in the manger]] has the final right to the manger, though he may have lain there for a very long time. I do not admit that right. I do not admit for instance that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America or the black people of Australia.

====South Africa====
{{Further|Apartheid|Baasskap}}
A number of Southern African nations experienced severe racial tension and conflict during global [[decolonization]], particularly as [[white Africans of European ancestry]] fought to protect their preferential social and political status. Racial segregation in South Africa began in colonial times under the [[Dutch Empire]]. It continued when the British took over the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1795. [[Apartheid]] was introduced as an officially structured policy by the [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]]-dominated [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] after the [[South African general election, 1948|general election of 1948]]. Apartheid's legislation divided inhabitants into four racial groups—"black", "white", "coloured", and "Indian", with coloured divided into several sub-classifications.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin-Ragaven, Laurel; London, Lesley; du Gruchy, Jeanelle (1999).

===Germany===
{{Further|Aryanism}}

[[Nazism]] promoted the idea of a superior [[Germanic people]] or [[Aryan race]] in Germany during the early 20th century. Notions of white supremacy and Aryan racial superiority were combined in the 19th century, with white supremacists maintaining the belief that white people were members of an Aryan "[[master race]]" that was superior to other races, particularly the Jews, who were described as the "Semitic race", [[Slavs]], and [[Names of the Romani people|Gypsies]], who they associated with "cultural sterility". [[Arthur de Gobineau]], a French racial theorist and aristocrat, blamed the fall of the [[Ancien Régime|''ancien régime'']] in France on racial degeneracy caused by racial intermixing, which he argued had destroyed the "purity" of the Nordic or Germanic race. Gobineau's theories, which attracted a strong following in Germany, emphasized the existence of an irreconcilable polarity between Aryan or Germanic peoples and Jewish culture.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

As the [[Nazi Party]]'s chief racial theorist, [[Alfred Rosenberg]] oversaw the construction of a human racial "ladder" that justified [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Hitler's racial and ethnic policies]]. Rosenberg promoted the [[Nordic theory]], which regarded [[Nordic race|Nordics]] as the "master race", superior to all others, including other Aryans (Indo-Europeans).&lt;ref&gt;Though Rosenberg does not use the word "master race". He uses the word "Herrenvolk" (i. e., ruling people) twice in his book ''The Myth'', first referring to the [[Amorite]]s (saying that [[Archibald Sayce|Sayce]] described them as fair skinned and blue eyed) and secondly quoting [[Victor Wallace Germains]]' description of the English in "The Truth about Kitchener". ("The Myth of the Twentieth Century") – Pages 26, 660 – 1930&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenberg got the racial term ''[[Untermensch]]'' from the title of [[Klansman]] [[Lothrop Stoddard]]'s 1922 book ''The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under-man''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Stoddard, Lothrop| author-link = Lothrop Stoddard| year = 1922| title = The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under Man| publisher = [[Charles Scribner's Sons]]| location = New York| url = https://archive.org/details/revoltagainstciv00stoduoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later adopted by the Nazis from that book's German version ''Der Kulturumsturz: Die Drohung des Untermenschen'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;

In establishing a restrictive entry system for Germany in 1925, Hitler wrote of his admiration for America's immigration laws: "The American Union categorically refuses the immigration of physically unhealthy elements, and simply excludes the immigration of certain races."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/american-laws-against-coloreds-influenced-nazi-racial-planners/ "American laws against 'coloreds' influenced Nazi racial planners"]. Times of Israel. Retrieved August 26, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

German praise for America's institutional racism, previously found in Hitler's ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', was continuous throughout the early 1930s. Nazi lawyers were advocates of the use of American models.&lt;ref name="Whitman"/&gt; Race-based U.S. citizenship and anti-miscegenation laws directly inspired the Nazis' two principal [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg racial laws]]—the Citizenship Law and the Blood Law.&lt;ref name="Whitman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitman|first1=James Q.|title=Hitler's American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law|date=2017|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=37–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; To preserve the Aryan or [[Nordic race]], the Nazis introduced the Nuremberg Laws in 1935, which forbade sexual relations and marriages between Germans and Jews, and later between Germans and [[Romani people|Romani]] and [[Slavs]]. The Nazis used the [[Mendelian inheritance]] theory to argue that social traits were innate, claiming that there was a racial nature associated with certain general traits such as inventiveness or criminal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Friedlander.

==Academic use of the term==
The term ''white supremacy'' is used in some academic studies of racial power to denote a system of structural or [[societal racism]] which privileges white people over others, regardless of the presence or the absence of racial hatred. According to this definition, white racial advantages occur at both a collective and an individual level (''[[ceteris paribus]]'', {{Nowrap|i. e.}}, when individuals are compared that do not relevantly differ except in ethnicity). Legal scholar Frances Lee Ansley explains this definition as follows:

{{Quote|By "white supremacy" I do not mean to allude only to the self-conscious racism of white supremacist [[hate group]]s.

Some [[anti-racism|anti-racist]] educators, such as Betita Martinez and the Challenging White Supremacy workshop, also use the term in this way. The term expresses historic continuities between a pre–[[civil rights movement]] era of open white supremacy and the current racial power structure of the United States.

Other intellectuals have criticized the term's recent rise in popularity among leftist activists as counterproductive. John McWhorter has described the use of "white supremacy" as straying from its commonly accepted meaning to encompass less extreme issues, thereby cheapening the term and potentially derailing productive discussion.&lt;ref name="left language"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/left-language-right-language/|title=Left Language, Right Language|access-date=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McWhorter"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://time.com/4584161/white-supremacy/|title=The Difference Between Racial Bias and White Supremacy|magazine=TIME |last1=McWhorter|first1=John|access-date=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political columnist [[Kevin Drum]] attributes the term's growing popularity to frequent use by [[Ta-Nehisi Coates]], describing it as a "terrible fad" which fails to convey nuance. He claims that the term should be reserved for those who are trying to promote the idea that whites are inherently superior to blacks and not used to characterize less blatantly racist beliefs or actions.&lt;ref name="MotherJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/11/lets-please-kill-white-supremacy-fad|title=Let's Be Careful With the "White Supremacy" Label|website=Mother Jones|access-date=December 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedersdorf"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/the-scourge-of-the-left-too-much-stigma-not-enough-persuasion/508961/|title='The Scourge of the Left': Too Much Stigma, Not Enough Persuasion|last=Friedersdorf|first=Conor|access-date=December 4, 2016|language=en-US|newspaper=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic use of the term to refer to systemic racism has been criticized by [[Conor Friedersdorf]] for the confusion it creates for the general public inasmuch as it differs from the more common dictionary definition; he argues that it is likely to alienate those it hopes to convince.&lt;ref name="Friedersdorf" /&gt;

==Ideologies and movements==
Supporters of [[Nordic race#Nordicism|Nordicism]] consider the "Nordic peoples" to be a superior race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nordicism|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nordicism|website=Merriam Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 19th century, white supremacy was attached to emerging theories of racial hierarchy. The German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] attributed cultural primacy to the white race:

{{Quote|The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the [[Brahman]]s, the [[Inca Empire|Incas]], and the rulers of the [[Polynesia|South Sea Islands]]. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | author-link = Arthur Schopenhauer | title = ''Parerga and Paralipomena'' | year = 1851 | pages = Vol. 2, Section 92| title-link = Parerga and Paralipomena }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Good Citizen Pillar of Fire Church July 1926.jpg|thumb|''[[The Good Citizen]]'' 1926, published by [[Pillar of Fire International|Pillar of Fire Church]]]]

The [[eugenics|eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]] argued in his 1916 book, ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'', that the Nordic race had been responsible for most of humanity's great achievements, and that [[Miscegenation|admixture]] was "race suicide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Grant | first = Madison | title = The Passing of the Great Race | publisher = C.

[[File:Klan-in-gainesville.jpg|thumb|left|267px|Members of the second [[Ku Klux Klan]] at a rally in 1923.]]

In the United States, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) is the group most associated with the white supremacist movement. Many white supremacist groups are based on the concept of preserving genetic purity, and do not focus solely on discrimination based on skin color.&lt;ref name="law.jrank.org"&gt;{{citation|url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/11302/White-Supremacy-Groups.html |title=White Supremacy Groups |work=Law Library – American Law and Legal Information |publisher=Net Industries and its Licensors|date=2019| access-date=October 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KKK's reasons for supporting [[racial segregation]] are not primarily based on religious ideals, but some Klan groups are openly [[Protestant]]. The KKK and other white supremacist groups like [[Aryan Nations]], [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]] and the [[White Patriot Party]] are considered [[Antisemitism in the United States|antisemitic]].&lt;ref name="law.jrank.org"/&gt;

[[Nazi Germany]] promulgated white supremacy based on the belief that the [[Aryan race]], or the Germans, were the ''[[master race]]''. It was combined with a [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics programme]] that aimed for [[racial hygiene]] through compulsory sterilization of sick individuals and extermination of ''[[Untermensch]]en'' ("subhumans"): [[Anti-Slavic sentiment|Slavs]], Jews and [[antiziganism|Romani]], which eventually culminated in [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;Gumkowski, Janusz; Leszczynski, Kazimierz; Robert, Edward (translator) (1961).

[[Christian Identity]] is another movement closely tied to white supremacy. Some white supremacists identify themselves as [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Odinists]], although many Odinists reject white supremacy. Some white supremacist groups, such as the South African [[Boeremag]], conflate elements of Christianity and Odinism. [[Creativity (religion)|Creativity]] (formerly known as "The World Church of the Creator") is [[atheism|atheistic]] and it denounces Christianity and other [[Theism|theistic religions]].&lt;ref name="Atheistic"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HB1wyFPRGm4C&amp;q=atheistic&amp;pg=PA23|title =The new white nationalism in America: its challenge to integration|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|quote=For instance, Ben Klassen, founder of the atheistic Church of the Creator and author of ''The White Man's Bible'', discusses Christianity extensively in his writings and denounces it as a religion that has brought untold horror into the world and has divided the white race.|access-date = March 27, 2011|isbn =9780521808866|date =June 10, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atheism"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rBgn3xB75ZcC&amp;q=competing+atheistic+white+racist+movement&amp;pg=PA493|title =The World's Religions: Continuities and Transformations|publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|quote=A competing atheistic or panthestic white racist movement also appeared, which included the Church of the Creator/ Creativity (Gardell 2003: 129–34).|access-date = March 27, 2011|isbn =9781135211004|date =May 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from this, its ideology is similar to that of many Christian Identity groups because it believes in the [[List of conspiracy theories#Antisemitic conspiracy theories|antisemitic conspiracy theory]] that there is a "Jewish conspiracy" in control of governments, the banking industry and the media. [[Matthew F. Hale]], founder of the World Church of the Creator, has published articles stating that all races other than white are "mud races", which is what the group's religion teaches.&lt;ref name="law.jrank.org"/&gt;

The white supremacist ideology has become associated with a racist faction of the [[skinhead]] [[subculture]], despite the fact that when the skinhead culture first developed in the United Kingdom in the late 1960s, it was heavily influenced by black fashions and [[Black music|music]], especially Jamaican [[reggae]] and [[ska]], and African American [[soul music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ska.about.com/musicperform/ska/library/1999/aa081699a.htm |title=Smiling Smash: An Interview with Cathal Smyth, a.k.a.

White supremacist recruitment activities are primarily conducted at a [[grassroots]] level as well as on the Internet. Widespread access to the Internet has led to a dramatic increase in white supremacist websites.&lt;ref name="Adversity"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Adams |first1=Josh |first2=Vincent J. |last2=Roscigno |title=White Supremacists, Oppositional Culture and the World Wide Web |journal=Social Forces |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=759–778 |date=November 20, 2009 |doi=10.1353/sof.2006.0001 |jstor=3598477|s2cid=144768434 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet provides a venue to openly express white supremacist ideas at little [[social cost]], because people who post the information are able to remain anonymous.

=== White separatism ===
{{anchor|White separatism}}
White [[separatism]] is a political and social movement that seeks the separation of [[white people]] from people of other [[race (human categorization)|races]] and [[ethnicity|ethnicities]]. This may include the establishment of a [[white ethnostate]] by removing non-whites from existing communities or by forming new communities elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3719/is_200607/ai_n16855771/pg_9/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203033702/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3719/is_200607/ai_n16855771/pg_9 |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 3, 2007 |title=The Strategy of White Separatism |journal=Journal of Political and Military Sociology |date=Summer 2006 |last1=Dobratz |first1=Betty A. |last2=Shanks-Meile |first2=Stephanie L. |name-list-style=amp|volume=34 |number=1 |pages=49–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern researchers do not view white separatism as distinct from white supremacist beliefs. The [[Anti-Defamation League]] defines white separatism as "a form of white supremacy";&lt;ref name="ADL"&gt;{{cite web |title=White Separatism |url=https://www.adl.org/resources/glossary-terms/white-separatism |publisher=ADL}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Southern Poverty Law Center defines both white nationalism and white separatism as "ideologies based on white supremacy."&lt;ref name="SPLC"&gt;{{cite web |title=SPLC reacts to Facebook policy on white nationalism |url=https://www.splcenter.org/news/2019/03/27/splc-reacts-facebook-policy-white-nationalism |publisher=SPLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook has banned content that is openly [[white nationalism|white nationalist]] or white separatist because "white nationalism and white separatism cannot be meaningfully separated from white supremacy and organized hate groups".&lt;ref name="Facebook"&gt;{{cite web |title=Standing Against Hate |date=March 27, 2019 |url=https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/03/standing-against-hate/ |publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Facebook to ban white nationalism and separatism |work=BBC News |date=March 28, 2019 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47728471 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the term to self-identify has been criticized as a dishonest rhetorical ploy. The Anti-Defamation League argues that white supremacists use the phrase because they believe it has fewer negative connotations than the term ''white supremacist''.&lt;ref name="ADL_def"&gt;{{cite web |title=ADL: White Separatism |url=https://www.adl.org/resources/glossary-terms/white-separatism |website=adl.org |publisher=The Anti-Defamation League |access-date=November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobratz &amp; Shanks-Meile reported that adherents usually reject [[Interracial marriage|marriage "outside the white race"]]. They argued for the existence of "a distinction between the white supremacist's desire to dominate (as in [[apartheid]], [[slavery]], or [[Racial segregation|segregation]]) and complete separation by race".&lt;ref&gt;Dobratz, Betty A. &amp; Shanks-Meile, Stephanie L. (2000) ''The White Separatist Movement in the United States: "White Power, White Pride!''. Baltimore: JHU Press. pp.vii, 10&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that this is a matter of pragmatism, that while many white supremacists are also white separatists, contemporary white separatists reject the view that returning to a system of segregation is possible or desirable in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Dobratz |first1=Betty A. |last2=Shanks-Meile |first2=Stephanie L. |name-list-style=amp|year=1997 |title=The White Separatist Movement in the United States: White Power, White Pride! |location=New York |publisher=Twayne Publishers |isbn=9780805738650 |oclc=37341476 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r59bGyH4lOAC|pages=ix,12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political violence ==
The [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Institute]] has estimated that 3,446 blacks were the victims of [[lynchings in the United States]] between 1882 and 1968, with the peak occurring in the 1890s at a time of economic stress in the South and increasing political suppression of blacks. If 1,297 whites were also lynched during this period, blacks were disproportionally targeted, representing 72.7% of all people lynched.&lt;ref name="tuskegee_umkc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lynchings: By State and Race, 1882–1968|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/lynchingsstate.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629081241/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/lynchingsstate.html|archive-date=June 29, 2010|access-date=July 26, 2010|publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law|quote=Statistics provided by the Archives at Tuskegee Institute.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=History of Lynchings|url=https://www.naacp.org/history-of-lynchings/|access-date=July 1, 2020|website=NAACP|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to scholar Amy L.
