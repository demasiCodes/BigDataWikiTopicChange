==Overview and history==
Because of the persecution or opposition to homosexuality in many world cultures throughout history, LGBT individuals have often turned to literature as a source of validation, understanding, and beautification of same-sex attraction. LGBT literature may also document the psychological stresses and alienation suffered by the gay community as LGBT individuals confront such challenges as prejudice, AIDS, self-loathing, bullying, violence, religious condemnation, denial, suicide, persecution, and other such obstacles.

Themes of love between individuals of the same gender are found in a variety of ancient texts throughout the world. The ancient Greeks, in particular, explored the theme on a variety of different levels in such works as Plato's ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]''.

=== Ancient mythology ===
{{main|LGBT themes in mythology|LGBT themes in classical mythology}}

Many [[mythologies]] and religious narratives include stories of romantic affection or sexuality between men or feature divine actions that result in changes in gender. These myths have been interpreted as forms of LGBT expression and modern conceptions of sexuality and gender have been applied to them. Myths have been used by individual cultures, in part, to explain and validate their particular social institutions or to explain the cause of transgender identity or homosexuality.

[[LGBT themes in classical mythology|In classical mythology]], male lovers were attributed to ancient [[Greek god]]s and heroes such as [[Zeus]], [[Apollo]], [[Poseidon]] and [[Heracles]] (including [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinth]], [[Nerites (mythology)|Nerites]] and [[Hylas]], respectively) as a reflection and validation of the tradition of [[pederasty]].&lt;ref name="GLBTQ Mythology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/classical_myth.html|title=Classical Mythology|publisher=glbtq.com|accessdate=February 5, 2015|last=Pequigney|first=Joseph|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415180456/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/classical_myth.html|archivedate=April 15, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
The era known as the [[Age of Enlightenment]] (1650s to 1780s) gave rise to, in part, a general challenge to the traditional doctrines of society in Western Europe. A particular interest in the Classical era of Greece and Rome "as a model for contemporary life" put the Greek appreciation of nudity, the male form and male friendship (and the inevitable homoerotic overtones) into art and literature.&lt;ref name="GLBTQ Enlightenment"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/europe_enlightenment.html |title=Europe: The Enlightenment |first=John D. |last=Stanley |publisher=glbtq.com |accessdate=February 1, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150131021736/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/europe_enlightenment.html |archivedate=January 31, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was common for gay authors at this time to include allusions to Greek mythological characters as a code that homosexual readers would recognize.&lt;ref name="HP 2014-05"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/trebor-healey/early-gay-literature-redi_b_5373869.html |title=Early Gay Literature Rediscovered |first=Trebor |last=Healey |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=May 28, 2014 |accessdate=May 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gay men of the period "commonly understood ancient Greece and Rome to be societies where homosexual relationships were tolerated and even encouraged," and references to those cultures might identify an author or book's sympathy with gay readers and gay themes but probably be overlooked by straight readers.&lt;ref name="HP 2014-05"/&gt; Despite the "increased visibility of queer behavior" and prospering networks of male prostitution in cities like Paris and London, homosexual activity had been outlawed in England (and by extension, the United States) as early as the [[Buggery Act 1533]]. Across much of Europe in the 1700s and 1800s, the legal punishment for sodomy was death, making it dangerous to publish or distribute anything with overt gay themes.&lt;ref name="GLBTQ Enlightenment"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HP 2014-05"/&gt; James Jenkins of [[Valancourt Books]] noted:
{{Quote|These sorts of coded, subtextual ways of writing about homosexuality were often necessary, since up until the 1950s British authors could be prosecuted for writing openly about homosexuality, and in the U.S., authors and publishers could also face legal action and suppression of their books, not to mention social or moral condemnation that might end an author's career."&lt;ref name="HP 2014-05"/&gt;}}

Many early [[Gothic fiction]] authors, like [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|Matthew Lewis]], [[William Thomas Beckford]] and [[Francis Lathom]], were homosexual, and would sublimate these themes and express them in more acceptable forms, using transgressive genres like Gothic and horror fiction.&lt;ref name="HP 2014-05"/&gt; The title character of Lewis's ''[[The Monk]]'' (1796) falls in love with young novice Rosario, and though Rosario is later revealed to be a woman named Matilda, the gay subtext is clear.&lt;ref name="HP 2014-05"/&gt; A similar situation occurs in [[Charles Maturin]]'s  ''The Fatal Revenge'' (1807) when the valet Cyprian asks his master, Ippolito, to kiss him as though he were Ippolito's female lover; later Cyprian is also revealed to be a woman. In Maturin's ''[[Melmoth the Wanderer]]'' (1820), the close friendship between a young monk and a new novice is scrutinized as potentially "too like love." [[Sheridan Le Fanu]]'s novella ''[[Carmilla]]'' (1872) basically invented the [[lesbian vampire]] story,&lt;ref name="Garber"&gt;{{cite book |last=Garber |first=Eric |author2= Lyn Paleo |title=Uranian Worlds: A Guide to Alternative Sexuality in Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror |chapter=''Carmilla'' |publisher=[[G.

''[[A Year in Arcadia: Kyllenion]]'' (1805) by  [[Augustus, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]] is "the earliest known novel that centers on an explicitly male-male love affair".&lt;ref name="Taggerty 612"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JwB5AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA612&amp; |title=Encyclopedia of Lesbian and Gay Histories and Cultures |editor1-first=George |editor1-last=Haggerty |editor2-first=Bonnie |editor2-last=Zimmerman |year=2000 |chapter=German Literature |page=612 |isbn=0-815-34055-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Set in ancient Greece, the German novel features several couples—including a homosexual one—falling in love, overcoming obstacles and living happily ever after.

=== 20th century ===
By the 20th century, discussion of homosexuality became more open and society's understanding of it evolved. A number of novels with explicitly gay themes and characters began to appear in the domain of mainstream or art literature.

[[Nobel Prize]]-winner [[André Gide]]'s semi-autobiographical novel ''[[The Immoralist]]'' (1902) finds a newly married man reawakened by his attraction to a series of young Arab boys.&lt;ref name="GLBTQ Gide 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/gide_a,2.html |title=Gide, André (1869-1951) - Page 2 |first=Scott |last=Fish |publisher=glbtq.com |accessdate=February 4, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205001837/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/gide_a%2C2.html |archivedate=February 5, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Bayard Taylor's ''Joseph and His Friend'' (1870) had been the first American gay novel, [[Edward Prime-Stevenson]]'s ''[[Imre: A Memorandum]]'' (1906) was the first in which the homosexual couple were happy and united at the end.

British author [[E.M. Forster]] earned a prominent reputation as a novelist while concealing his own homosexuality from the broader British public. In 1913-14, he privately penned ''[[Maurice (novel)|Maurice]]'', a bildungsroman that follows a young, upper-middle-class man through the self-discovery of his own attraction to other men, two relationships, and his interactions with an often uncomprehending or hostile society. The book is notable for its affirming tone and happy ending. "A happy ending was imperative," wrote Forster, "...I was determined that in fiction anyway, two men should fall in love and remain in it for the ever and ever that fiction allows ... Happiness is its keynote."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forster|first=Edward Morgan|title=Maurice|year=1971|publisher=W.W.

Mann]] said of the novel, "[Alec Scudder of ''Maurice'' was] a refreshingly unapologetic young gay man who was not an effete Oscar Wilde aristocrat, but rather a working class, masculine, ordinary guy ... an example of the working class teaching the privileged class about honesty and authenticity {{mdash}} a bit of a stereotype now, but back then quite extraordinary."&lt;ref name="Meloy"/&gt;

[[Blair Niles]]'s ''[[Strange Brother]]'' (1931), about the platonic relationship between a heterosexual woman and a gay man in [[New York City]] in the late 1920s and early 1930s, is an early, objective exploration of homosexual issues during the [[Harlem Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Stryker 97"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Susan Stryker |last=Stryker |first=Susan |title=Queer Pulp: Perverted Passions from the Golden Age of the Paperback |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=Chronicle Books |year=2001 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though praised for its journalistic approach, sympathetic nature and promotion of tolerance and compassion,&lt;ref name="Stryker 100"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stryker |title=Queer Pulp |year=2001 |page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarotte"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sarotte |first=Georges-Michel |title=Like a Brother: Male Homosexuality in the American Novel and Theatre from Herman Melville to James Baldwin |location=Garden City, NY |publisher=Anchor Press |year=1978 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; the novel has been numbered among a group of early gay novels that is "cast in the form of a tragic melodrama"&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite book |last=Young |first=Ian |title=The Male Homosexual in Literature: A Bibliography |location=Metuchen, NJ |publisher=The Scarecrow Press |year=1975 |pages=153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to editor and author [[Anthony Slide]], illustrates the "basic assumption that gay characters in literature must come to a tragic end."&lt;ref name="Slide1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Slide |first=Anthony |authorlink=Anthony Slide |title=[[Lost Gay Novels|Lost Gay Novels: A Reference Guide to Fifty Works from the First Half of the Twentieth Century]] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2003 |pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Smoke, Lilies, and Jade" by gay author and artist [[Richard Bruce Nugent]], published in 1926, was the first short story by an African-American writer openly addressing his homosexuality.

{{Quote|''A Single Man'' more fully develops the context of gay oppression than do [Isherwood's] earlier novels ... To portray homosexuals as simply another tribe in a nation comprising many different tribes is both to soften the stigma linked to homosexuality and to encourage solidarity among gay people.

Presaging the gay liberation movement, ''A Single Man'' presents homosexuality as simply a human variation that should be accorded value and respect and depicts homosexuals as a group whose grievances should be redressed.&lt;ref name="GLBTQ Isherwood 3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/isherwood_c,3.html |title=Isherwood, Christopher (1904-1986): Isherwood's Masterpiece, ''A Single Man'' |first=Claude J. |last=Summers |page=3 |publisher=glbtq.com |accessdate=February 6, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206190619/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/isherwood_c,3.html |archivedate=February 6, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[George Baxt]]'s ''A Queer Kind of Death'' (1966) introduced Pharaoh Love, the first gay black detective in fiction. The novel was met with considerable acclaim, and ''The New York Times'' critic [[Anthony Boucher]] wrote, "This is a detective story, and unlike any other that you have read.

=== 21st century ===
In the twenty-first century, much of LGBT literature has achieved a high level of sophistication and many works have earned mainstream acclaim. Notable authors include [[Alan Hollinghurst]], [[André Aciman]], [[Michael Cunningham]], [[Michael Chabon]], [[Colm Tóibín]], [[Sarah Waters]], [[John Boyne]], [[Pablo Soler Frost]] and [[Jamie O'Neill]]. LGBT themes have also become more visible in a growing body of high-quality young adult literature, with notable authors including [[Alex Sanchez (author)|Alex Sanchez]], [[Stephen Chbosky]], [[Shyam Selvadurai]], [[Perry Moore]], and [[David Levithan]]. [[Becky Albertalli]]'s teen novel ''[[Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda]]'' was adapted into the feature film ''[[Love, Simon]]'' by [[20th Century Fox]], the first film by a major studio focused on a gay teenage romance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/10/31/love-simon-first-look/ |title=''Love, Simon'': Your first look at 2018's major studio gay teen romance |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=March 11, 2018|last=Stack |first=Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://variety.com/2018/scene/vpage/love-simon-premiere-gay-teen-romantic-comedy-1202722636/ |title=''Love, Simon'' Stars Say Gay Teen Romance Will Save Lives |last=Lang |first=Brent |date=March 9, 2018|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=March 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gay pulp==
{{main|Gay male pulp fiction|Lesbian pulp fiction}}
Gay pulp fiction or gay pulps, refers to printed works, primarily fiction, that include references to male [[homosexuality]], specifically male [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]], and that are cheaply produced, typically in [[paperback book]]s made of wood pulp paper; lesbian pulp fiction is similar work about women.  [[Michael Bronski]], the editor of an anthology of gay pulp writing, notes in his introduction, "Gay pulp is not an exact term, and it is used somewhat loosely to refer to a variety of books that had very different origins and markets"&lt;ref&gt;Bronski, Michael, ed.  ''Pulp Friction:  Uncovering the Golden Age of Gay Male Pulps''.  New York:  St. Martin's Griffin, 2003, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  People often use the term to refer to the "classic" gay pulps that were produced before about 1970, but it may also be used to refer to the gay erotica or pornography in [[paperback]] [[book]] or [[digest magazine]] form produced since that date.

==Speculative fiction==
{{main|LGBT themes in speculative fiction|LGBT themes in horror fiction}}
[[File:Carmilla.jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[D. H. Friston]] from the first publication of the [[lesbian vampire]] novella ''[[Carmilla]]'' (1872) by [[Sheridan Le Fanu]].&lt;ref name="Garber"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carmilla 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carmilla 2"/&gt;]]
[[Homosexuality in speculative fiction]] refers to the incorporation of [[homosexual]] themes into [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], [[horror fiction]] and related genres which together constitute [[speculative fiction]]. Such elements may include a [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] or [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) character as the protagonist or a major character, or exploration of varieties of [[human sexual behavior|sexual experience]] that deviate from the conventional.

Science fiction and fantasy have traditionally been [[puritanical]] genres aimed at a male readership, and can be more restricted than non-genre literature by their [[genre convention|conventions]] of characterisation and the effect that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender.&lt;ref name="Clute"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=John Clute |author=Clute, John |author2=[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]] |title=[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]] |location=London |publisher=[[Orbit Books]] |issue=1993 (2nd edition, 1999) |isbn=1-85723-897-4 |page=1088}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[pulp magazine]] era (1920s-30s), explicit sexuality of any kind was rare in genre science fiction and fantasy.&lt;ref name="Clute"/&gt; Then, according to Joanna Russ, in the more relaxed [[Golden Age of Science Fiction]] (1940s-50s) the genre "resolutely ignored the whole subject" of homosexuality.&lt;ref name="UW pg. xxii"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joanna Russ|chapter=Introduction |title=Uranian Worlds |page=xxii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers were able to introduce more explicit sexuality into their work as the readership for science fiction and fantasy began to age in the 1950s, however until the late 1960s few depicted alternative sexuality or revised gender roles, or openly investigated sexual questions.&lt;ref name="Clute"/&gt; After the pushing back of boundaries in the 1960s and 70s, homosexuality gained much wider acceptance, and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional SF stories with little comment. By the 1980s, blatant homophobia was no longer considered acceptable to most readers.&lt;ref name="Ency Homo"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dynes, Wayne R. |author2=Warren Johansson |author3=William A.

The book covers science fiction literature published before 1990 (2nd edition, 1990), providing a short review and commentary on each piece.&lt;ref name="UW"&gt;{{cite book |author=Garber &amp; Paleo |title=Uranian Worlds |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Hollinger &amp; Groden, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

As speculative fiction gives authors and readers the freedom to imagine societies that are different from real-life cultures, this freedom makes speculative fiction a useful means of examining sexual bias by forcing the reader to reconsider his or her [[heteronormative]] cultural assumptions. It has also been claimed that LGBT readers identify strongly with the [[mutants]], [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|aliens]] and other outsider characters found in speculative fiction.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

James Jenkins of [[Valancourt Books]] notes that the connection between gay fiction and horror goes back to the [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] novels of the 1790s and early 1800s.&lt;ref name="HP 2014-05"/&gt; Many Gothic authors, like [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|Matthew Lewis]], [[William Thomas Beckford]] and [[Francis Lathom]], were homosexual, and according to Jenkins "the traditional explanation for the gay/horror connection is that it was impossible for them to write openly about gay themes back then (or even perhaps express them, since words like 'gay' and 'homosexual' didn't exist), so they sublimated them and expressed them in more acceptable forms, using the medium of a transgressive genre like horror fiction."&lt;ref name="HP 2014-05"/&gt; Early works with clear gay subtext include Lewis's ''[[The Monk]]'' (1796) and both [[Charles Maturin]]'s  ''The Fatal Revenge'' (1807) and ''[[Melmoth the Wanderer]]'' (1820).&lt;ref name="HP 2014-05"/&gt; Somewhat later came the first [[lesbian vampire]] novella ''[[Carmilla]]'' (1872) by [[Sheridan Le Fanu]]&lt;ref name="Garber"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carmilla 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carmilla 2"/&gt; and ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1890) by [[Oscar Wilde]], which shocked readers with its sensuality and overtly homosexual characters.&lt;ref name="Garber &amp; Paleo 1983 148"/&gt; There is even gay subtext in [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'' (1897) as the title character warns off the female vampires and claims Jonathan Harker, saying "This man belongs to me!"&lt;ref name="HP 2014-05"/&gt; The erotic metaphor of vampirism, inspired by ''Carmilla'', has resulted in numerous vampire films since the 1970s strongly implying or explicitly portraying lesbianism.&lt;ref name=DR&gt;{{cite book |title=Dark Romance: Sexuality in the Horror Film |last=Hogan |first=David J. |chapter=Lugosi, Lee, and the Vampires |pages=146–163|year=1997 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=0-7864-0474-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comics==
{{main|LGBT themes in comics|Bara (genre)|Yuri (genre)|Yaoi}}
LGBT themes in comics is a relatively new concept, as [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) themes and [[fictional character|characters]] were historically omitted intentionally from the content of [[comic book]]s and their [[comic strip]] predecessors, due to either censorship or the perception that comics were for children.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Yellow Kid]]'', first serialized in 1895, is considered the "first newspaper comic strip," though "the mechanics of comic strips were in use well before the ''Kid''{{'s}} debut in illustrated magazines." {{citation|last=Wood|first=Mary|title=Origins of the Kid|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA04/wood/ykid/illustrated.htm|publisher=xroads.virginia.edu|date=2004-02-02|accessdate=2009-03-18|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; With any mention of [[homosexuality]] in mainstream United States comics forbidden by the [[Comics Code Authority]] (CCA) until 1989,&lt;ref name="Nyberg 1998"&gt;{{citation |last=Nyberg |first=Amy Kiste |title=Seal of Approval: The History of the Comics Code |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |year=1998 |location=Jackson |pages=143, 175–176 |isbn=0-87805-975-X |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; earlier attempts at exploring these issues in the US took the form of subtle hints or [[subtext]] regarding a character's sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Applegate"&gt;{{citation|last=Applegate |first=David |title=''Coming Out in the Comic Strips'' |url=http://cagle.msnbc.com/hogan/features/out/out.asp |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |accessdate=2009-03-29 |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002083335/http://cagle.msnbc.com/hogan/features/out/out.asp |archivedate=2008-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; LGBT themes were tackled earlier in [[underground comics]] from the early 1970s onward. Independently published one-off comic books and series, often produced by gay creators and featuring autobiographical storylines, tackled political issues of interest to LGBT readers.

[[Comic strips]] have also dealt in subtext and innuendo, their wide distribution in newspapers limiting their inclusion of controversial material. The first openly gay characters appeared in prominent strips in the late 1970s; representation of LGBT issues in these titles causes vociferous reaction, both praise and condemnation, to the present day. Comic strips aimed at LGBT audiences are also syndicated in gay- and lesbian-targeted magazines and comics have been created to educate people about LGBT-related issues and to influence real-world politics, with their format and distribution allowing them to transmit messages more subtle, complex, and positive than typical education material. Portrayal of LGBT themes in comics is recognized by several notable awards, including the [[Gaylactic Spectrum Award]] and [[GLAAD Media Awards]] for outstanding comic book and comic strip.

Since the 1990s LGBT themes have become more common in mainstream US comics, including in a number of titles in which a gay character is the star. European comics have been more inclusive from an earlier date. The lack of censorship, and greater acceptance of comics as a medium of adult entertainment led to less controversy about the representation of LGBT characters. The popular Japanese [[manga]] tradition has included genres of girls' comics that feature homosexual relationships since the 1970s, in the form of ''[[yaoi]]'' and ''[[yuri (genre)|yuri]]''. These works are often extremely romantic and include archetypal characters that often are not identified as gay. Since the Japanese "gay boom" of the 1990s, a body of manga aimed at LGBT customers has been produced, which have more realistic and autobiographical themes. [[Hentai|Pornographic manga]] also often includes sexualised depictions of lesbians and intersex people. [[Queer theory|Queer theorists]]{{who|date=October 2011}} have noted that LGBT characters in mainstream comic books are usually shown as assimilated into heterosexual society, whereas in alternative comics the diversity and uniqueness of LGBT culture is emphasized.

Controversy and politicization followed its publication.

Some of the best known children's books with gay themes include ''[[Heather Has Two Mommies]]'' (1989) and ''[[Daddy's Roommate]]'' (1991), published by [[LGBT]] publisher [[Alyson Books]]. Both books discussed same-sex parenting and attracted criticism and controversy. The [[American Library Association]] ranked ''Heather Has Two Mommies'' as the third and second most frequently [[List of most commonly-challenged books in the United States|challenged book]] in the United States in 1993 and 1994, respectively.

Recent controversies include ''[[King &amp; King]]'', originally written in Dutch and published in English in 2002. The book is about a prince uninterested in princesses, who eventually falls in love with another prince.

In July 2014, Singapore's National Library Board (NLB), a state-funded network of 26 public libraries, confirmed it would destroy three children's books with pro-LGBT families themes for being "against its 'pro-family' stance[,] following complaints by a parent and its own internal review." The decision was widely criticized by LGBT supporters and the arts and literary community who see the actions as akin to [[book burning]]s and other forms of [[censorship]]. The three books are “And Tango Makes Three,” which covers the true story of a pair of male penguins that successfully raise a chick, “The White Swan Express”, which features children adopted by a variety of families including gay, mixed-race and single parents, and “Who’s In My Family”, which references families with homosexual parents. Two weeks after a gay rights rally, these books "sparked a fierce debate" between the religious conservatives, who opposed the rally, and Singapore's growing gay-rights lobby.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;{{cite web |title=Singapore national library to destroy LGBT-themed children’s books |date=July 11, 2014 |publisher=[[TheJournal.ie]] |url=http://www.thejournal.ie/singapore-destroy-books-1565594-Jul2014/ |accessdate=March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bisexual themes===
To date, there have been no explicitly bisexual characters–either children or adults–in children's books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bickford|first1=John H., III|title=Examining LGBTQ-Based Literature Intended for Primary and Intermediate Elementary Students|journal=[[The Elementary School Journal]]|date=2018|volume=118|issue=3|pages=409–425|doi=10.1086/696139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="epstein2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epstein|first1=B.

According to a 2015 [[NPR]] story, hundreds of books featuring transgender characters have been published since 2000. Although a vast majority of them tend to be targeted to a teenage audience, these self-publications also consist of picture books for younger children.&lt;ref name="NPR George"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ulaby|first=Neda|authorlink=Neda Ulaby|title=''George'' Wants You To Know: She's Really Melissa|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/08/27/434277989/-george-wants-you-to-know-she-s-really-melissa|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=August 27, 2015|accessdate=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
