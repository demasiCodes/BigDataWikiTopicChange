[[Intersex]] people are born with [[sex characteristics]], such as [[chromosome]]s, [[gonad]]s, or [[genital]]s that, according to the UN [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]], "do not fit typical binary notions of [[male]] or [[female]] bodies".&lt;ref name="unfe-fact"&gt;{{Cite web | author = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | publisher = United Nations [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | title = Free &amp; Equal Campaign Fact Sheet: Intersex | date = 2015 | url = https://unfe.org/system/unfe-65-Intersex_Factsheet_ENGLISH.pdf | access-date = 28 March 2016 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071043/https://unfe.org/system/unfe-65-Intersex_Factsheet_ENGLISH.pdf | archivedate = 4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Because their bodies are seen as different, intersex children and adults are often stigmatized and subjected to multiple human rights violations".&lt;ref name="unfe-fact" /&gt;

A 2013 first international pilot study. [[Human Rights between the Sexes]], by [[Dan Christian Ghattas]], found that intersex people are discriminated against worldwide: "Intersex individuals are considered individuals with a «disorder» in all areas in which Western medicine prevails. They are more or less obviously treated as sick or «abnormal», depending on the respective society."&lt;ref name="ghattas"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/endf_human_rights_between_the_sexes.pdf | title = Human Rights Between the Sexes | first1 = Dan Christian | last1 = Ghattas | authorlink1 = Dan Christian Ghattas | last2 = [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]] | date = September 2013 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923223221/http://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/endf_human_rights_between_the_sexes.pdf | archivedate = 2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oiieurope.org/a-preliminary-study-on-the-life-situations-of-inter-individuals/ | title = A preliminary study on the life situations of inter* individuals | work = [[OII Europe]] | date = 4 November 2013 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150704015158/http://oiieurope.org/a-preliminary-study-on-the-life-situations-of-inter-individuals/ | archivedate = 4 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations states that intersex people suffer stigma on the basis of physical characteristics, "including violations of their rights to health and physical integrity, to be free from torture and ill-treatment, and to equality and non- discrimination."&lt;ref name="unfe-fact" /&gt; The UN has called for governments to end discrimination against intersex people:

Intersex people face genetic de-selection via pregnancy terminations and [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]], as well as abandonment, neglect, infanticide and murder due to their [[sex characteristics]]. In 2015, the [[Council of Europe]] published an Issue Paper on ''Human rights and intersex people'', remarking:

A 2016 Australian study of 272 people born with atypical sex characteristics found that 60% had received medical treatment on the basis of their sex characteristics, half receiving such treatments aged under 18 years, "most commonly genital surgeries (many of which occurred in infancy) and hormone treatments", and the "majority experienced at least one negative impact".&lt;ref name="oiidemo-2016"&gt;{{cite web | title = Demographics | url = https://oii.org.au/demographics/ | last = Organisation Intersex International Australia | authorlink = Organisation Intersex International Australia | date = July 28, 2016 | accessdate = 2016-11-12 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161001215740/https://oii.org.au/demographics/ | archivedate = October 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, while some parents and physicians had attempted to empower participants, the study found "strong evidence suggesting a pattern of institutionalised shaming and coercive treatment" and poor (or no) information provision.&lt;ref name="jonesbk2016" /&gt; 16% of study participants were not provided with information on options of having no treatment, and some were provided with misinformation about the nature of their treatment, and information about peer support was also lacking.

Decision-making on any cancer and other physical risks may be intertwined with "normalizing" rationales. In a major Parliamentary report in Australia, published in October 2013, the Senate Community Affairs References committee was "disturbed" by the possible implications of current practices in the treatment of cancer risk. The committee stated: "clinical intervention pathways stated to be based on probabilities of cancer risk may be encapsulating treatment decisions based on other factors, such as the desire to conduct normalising surgery... Treating cancer may be regarded as unambiguously therapeutic treatment, while normalising surgery may not. Thus basing a decision on cancer risk might avoid the need for court oversight in a way that a decision based on other factors might not. The committee is disturbed by the possible implications of this..."&lt;ref name="SenateOnSterilisation" /&gt;

=== Medical photography and display ===

Photographs of intersex children's genitalia are circulated in medical communities for documentary purposes, and individuals with intersex traits may be subjected to repeated genital examinations and display to medical teams. Sharon Preves described this as a form of humiliation and stigmatization, leading to an "inability to deflect negative associations of self" where "genitalia must be revealed in order to allow for stigmatization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Preves|first=Sharon Elaine|title=Negotiating the Constraints of Gender Binarism: Intersexuals' Challenge to Gender Categorization|journal=Current Sociology|date=July 2000|volume=48|issue=3|pages=27–50|doi=10.1177/0011392100048003004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PREV&gt;{{Cite book| last =  Preves| first =  Sharon| title = Intersex and Identity, the Contested Self| year = 2003| publisher = Rutgers| isbn = 978-0-8135-3229-5}} p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CRPH" /&gt; According to Creighton ''et al'', the "experience of being photographed has exemplified for many people with intersex conditions the powerlessness and humiliation felt during medical investigations and interventions".&lt;ref name=CRPH&gt;{{Cite news| last1 =  Creighton| first1 =  Sarah| last2 =  Alderson| first2 =  J| last3 =  Brown| first3 =  S| last4 =  Minto| first4 =  Cathy| year = 2002| title = Medical photography: ethics, consent and the intersex patient|periodical = BJU International| issue = 89| pages = 67–71| url =  http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118927929/PDFSTART?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Access to medical services ===

Adults with intersex variations report poor mental health due to experiences of medicalization,&lt;ref name="liao-2013"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/19419899.2013.831217| issn = 1941-9899| volume = 5| issue = 1| pages = 83–101| last1 = Liao| first1 = Lih-Mei| last2 = Simmonds| first2 = Margaret| title = A values-driven and evidence-based health care psychology for diverse sex development| journal = Psychology &amp; Sexuality| date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many individuals avoiding care as a result.

== Inciting hate crimes by allegations of sex crimes ==
One increasingly common cause of [[hate crime]]s against intersex people is the neurological claim that male and female brains have fundamentally different sexualities, in particular the claim that men are sexually impulsive and aggressive and bound to act on their sexual fantasies while most women are said to have a wider range of sexual fantasies than most men, including fantasies that it would be unacceptable to act on. The claim that a combination of one trait that most men have and one trait that most women have would produce a sex criminal adds up to allegations that intersex people are sex offenders. To decrease such severe discrimination against intersex people, some researchers advocate more public information about the error sources in the sexological studies that are said to show such sex differences. This includes the possibility that societal double standards may scare more men than women into not talking about or otherwise revealing their sex fantasies (corroborated by the existence of characteristics that differ between male volunteers and male nonvolunteers, but not between female volunteers and female nonvolunteers, in erotica research) giving a false appearance of men having narrower ranges of sexual fantasies than women, and the possibility that men who want to be castrated out of their spiritual beliefs may have to commit sex crimes and claim that it was due to uncontrollable urges to get castrated since such surgery is not off the shelf (corroborated by the overrepresentation of religious groups in child sexual abuse scandals that cannot be explained by biopsychiatric correlations) creating a false appearance of men being less able to control their sexual impulses than women. Certain intersex rights advocates argue that this may dispel the myth that intersex people are "hybrid degenerated" to be sex criminals, creating more understanding for intersex people.&lt;ref&gt;Trans and Intersex People: Discrimination on the Grounds of Sex, Gender Identity and Gender Expression, 2012, Christa Tobler and Silvan Agius&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Between the Sexes: A Preliminary Study on the Life Situations of Inter*individuals, 2013, Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suicide and self-harm ==

The impact of discrimination and stigma can also be seen in high rates of suicidal tendencies and self harm. Multiple anecdotal reports, including from [[Intersex rights in China|Hong Kong]] and [[Intersex rights in Kenya|Kenya]] point to high levels of suicidality amongst intersex people.&lt;ref name="luk-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="odhiambo-2016" /&gt; The Australian sociological study of 272 people born with atypical sex characteristics found that 60% had thought about suicide, and 42% thought about self-harm, "on the basis of issues related to having an intersex variation ... 19% had attempted suicide"; causes identified included stigma, discrimination, family rejection and school bullying.&lt;ref name="jones2016ed" /&gt;

A 2013 German clinical study found high rates of distress, with "prevalence rates of self-harming behavior and suicidal tendencies ... comparable to traumatized women with a history of physical or sexual abuse."&lt;ref name="schutzmann"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s10508-007-9241-9| issn = 0004-0002| volume = 38| issue = 1| pages = 16–33| last1 = Schützmann| first1 = Karsten| last2 = Brinkmann| first2 = Lisa| last3 = Schacht| first3 = Melanie| last4 = Richter-Appelt| first4 = Hertha| title = Psychological Distress, Self-Harming Behavior, and Suicidal Tendencies in Adults with Disorders of Sex Development| journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior| date = February 2009 | pmid=17943433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar results have been reported in Australia&lt;ref name="schutzmann" /&gt; and Denmark.&lt;ref name="liao-2013" /&gt;

== Education ==

An [[Intersex rights in Australia|Australian]] sociological survey of 272 persons born with atypical sex characteristics, published in 2016, found that 18% of respondents (compared to an Australian average of 2%) failed to complete secondary school, with early school leaving coincident with pubertal medical interventions, bullying on the basis of physical characteristics, and other factors.&lt;ref name="jones2016ed"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/14681811.2016.1149808| issn = 1468-1811 | pages = 602–618| last = Jones| first = Tiffany| title = The needs of students with intersex variations| journal = Sex Education| volume = 16 | issue = 6 | date = March 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Intersex rights in Kenya|Kenyan]] news report suggests high rates of early school leaving, with the organisation Gama Africa reporting that 60% of 132 known intersex people had dropped out of school "because of the harassment and treatment they received from their peers and their teachers".&lt;ref name="odhiambo-2016"/&gt;

The Australian study found that schools lacked inclusive services such as relevant puberty and sex education curricula and counselling, for example, not representing a full range of human bodily diversity. Only a quarter of respondents felt positive about their schooling experiences, schooling coincided with disclosure of an intersex condition, associated with well-being risks, and early school leaving peaked "during the years most associated with puberty and hormone therapy interventions".&lt;ref name="jones2016ed" /&gt; Cognitive differences may also be associated with some traits such as sex chromosome variations.&lt;ref name="hong-2014"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2790-13.2014| issn = 0270-6474| volume = 34| issue = 10| pages = 3509–3516| last1 = Hong| first1 = D.

== Poverty and employment discrimination ==

The impact of discrimination and stigma can be seen in high rates of poverty. A 2015 Australian survey of people born with atypical sex characteristics found high levels of poverty, in addition to very high levels of early school leaving, and higher than average rates of disability.&lt;ref name="jonesbk2016"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Open Book Publishers| isbn = 978-1-78374-208-0| last1 = Jones| first1 = Tiffany| last2 = Hart| first2 = Bonnie| last3 = Carpenter| first3 = Morgan| last4 = Ansara| first4 = Gavi| last5 = Leonard| first5 = William| last6 = Lucke| first6 = Jayne| title = Intersex: Stories and Statistics from Australia| location = Cambridge, UK| accessdate = 2016-02-02| date = February 2016| url = http://oii.org.au/wp-content/uploads/key/Intersex-Stories-Statistics-Australia.pdf| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160914152729/http://oii.org.au/wp-content/uploads/key/Intersex-Stories-Statistics-Australia.pdf| archivedate = 2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6% of the 272 survey participants reported being homeless or couch surfing.&lt;ref name="jones2016ed" /&gt;

[[OII Europe]] states that "stigma, structural and verbal discrimination, harassment" as well as harmful practices and lack of legal recognition can lead to "inadequate education, broken careers and poverty (including homelessness) due to pathologisation and related trauma, a disturbed family life due to taboo and medicalisation, lack of self-esteem and a high risk of becoming suicidal."&lt;ref name="oiieu-2016"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://intervisibility.eu | title = European Intersex Visibility Works! | last = OII Europe | authorlink = OII Europe | accessdate = 2016-11-12 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161114001648/http://intervisibility.eu/ | archivedate = 2016-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Intersex and LGBT}}
Intersex people may face discrimination within [[LGBT]] settings and multiple organizations have highlighted appeals to LGBT rights recognition that fail to address the issue of unnecessary "normalising" treatments on intersex children, using the portmanteau term "[[Pinkwashing (LGBT)|pinkwashing]]".

Emi Koyama has described how inclusion of intersex in LGBTI can fail to address intersex-specific human rights issues, including creating false impressions "that intersex people's rights are protected" by laws protecting LGBT people, and failing to acknowledge that many intersex people are not LGBT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Koyama| first = Emi| title = Adding the "I": Does Intersex Belong in the LGBT Movement?| work = Intersex Initiative| url = http://www.intersexinitiative.org/articles/lgbti.html| access-date = 18 May 2016| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160517075057/http://www.intersexinitiative.org/articles/lgbti.html| archivedate = 17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Kaggwa]] of SIPD Uganda has written that, while the gay community "offers us a place of relative safety, it is also oblivious to our specific needs".&lt;ref name="Kaggwa2016"&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0261-3077| last = Kaggwa| first = Julius| authorlink = Julius Kaggwa| title = I'm an intersex Ugandan – life has never felt more dangerous| work = [[The Guardian]]| accessdate = 2016-10-03| date = September 19, 2016| url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/intersex-ugandan-lgbt-gay-rights-life-never-felt-more-dangerous?CMP=share_btn_tw| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161006015137/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/intersex-ugandan-lgbt-gay-rights-life-never-felt-more-dangerous?CMP=share_btn_tw| archivedate = October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mauro Cabral]] has written that [[transgender]] people and organizations "need to stop approaching intersex issues as if they were trans issues" including use of intersex as a means of explaining being transgender; "we can collaborate a lot with the intersex movement by making it clear how wrong that approach is".&lt;ref name="cabral-2016"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Cabral| first = Mauro| authorlink = Mauro Cabral Grinspan| title = IAD2016: A Message from Mauro Cabral| work = GATE – [[Global Action for Trans Equality]]| accessdate = 2016-11-12| date = October 26, 2016| url = https://transactivists.org/2016/10/26/iad2016-a-message-from-mauro-cabral/| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161103133403/https://transactivists.org/2016/10/26/iad2016-a-message-from-mauro-cabral/| archivedate = November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] states that some intersex individuals are same sex attracted, and some are heterosexual, but "LGBTI activism has fought for the rights of people who fall outside of expected binary sex and gender norms"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Intersex for allies | url = http://oii.org.au/allies | date = November 21, 2012 | last = Organisation Intersex International Australia | authorlink = Organisation Intersex International Australia | access-date = 18 May 2016 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160607042937/http://oii.org.au/allies/ | archivedate = 7 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaynewsnetwork.com.au/news/oii-releases-new-resource-on-intersex-issues-13999.html OII releases new resource on intersex issues] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606202143/http://gaynewsnetwork.com.au/news/oii-releases-new-resource-on-intersex-issues-13999.html |date=2014-06-06 }}, ''Intersex for allies'' and ''Making services intersex inclusive'' by Organisation Intersex International Australia, via Gay News Network, 2 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; but, in June 2016, the same organization pointed to contradictory statements by Australian governments, suggesting that the dignity and rights of LGBTI (LGBT and intersex) people are recognized while, at the same time, harmful practices on intersex children continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Submission: list of issues for Australia's Convention Against Torture review | url = https://oii.org.au/30546/loi-cat-review/ | work = [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] | date = June 28, 2016 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160916201538/https://oii.org.au/30546/loi-cat-review/ | archivedate = September 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, [[Zwischengeschlecht]] described actions to promote equality or civil status legislation without action on banning "intersex genital mutilations" as a form of [[Pinkwashing (LGBT)|pinkwashing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = "Intersex legislation" that allows the daily mutilations to continue = PINKWASHING of IGM practices | url = http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/Intersex-politics-that-ignore-the-daily-mutilations-PINKWASHING-OF-IGM-PRACTICES | work = [[Zwischengeschlecht]] | date = August 28, 2016 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160919050911/http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/Intersex-politics-that-ignore-the-daily-mutilations-PINKWASHING-OF-IGM-PRACTICES | archivedate = September 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has previously highlighted evasive government statements to UN Treaty Bodies that conflate intersex, transgender and LGBT issues, instead of addressing harmful practices on infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = TRANSCRIPTION &gt; UK Questioned over Intersex Genital Mutilations by UN Committee on the Rights of the Child – Gov Non-Answer + Denial | url = http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/UK-Questioned-over-Intersex-Genital-Mutilations-by-UN-Committee-on-the-Rights-of-the-Child | work = [[Zwischengeschlecht]] | date = May 26, 2016 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160919045730/http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/UK-Questioned-over-Intersex-Genital-Mutilations-by-UN-Committee-on-the-Rights-of-the-Child | archivedate = September 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
