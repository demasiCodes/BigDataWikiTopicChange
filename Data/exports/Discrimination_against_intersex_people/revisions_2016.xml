'''[[Intersex]]''' people are born with [[sex characteristics]], such as [[chromosome]]s, [[gonad]]s, or [[genital]]s that, according to the UN [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]], "do not fit typical binary notions of [[male]] or [[female]] bodies";&lt;ref name="unfe-fact"&gt;{{Cite web| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | publisher = United Nations [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | title = Free &amp; Equal Campaign Fact Sheet: Intersex| date = 2015| url = https://unfe.org/system/unfe-65-Intersex_Factsheet_ENGLISH.pdf | access-date = 28 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Because their bodies are seen as different, intersex children and adults are often stigmatized and subjected to multiple human rights violations".&lt;ref name="unfe-fact" /&gt;

Discriminatory treatment includes infanticide, abandonment, mutilation and neglect, as well as broader concerns regarding right to life.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scope-2014" /&gt; Intersex people face discrimination in education, employment, healthcare, sport, with an impact on mental and physical health, and on poverty levels, including as a result of harmful medical practices.&lt;ref name="jonesbk2016" /&gt;

The United Nations, [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]], [[Council of Europe]], [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]], and other human rights institutions, have called for countries to ban discrimination and combat stigma.&lt;ref name="un-2016" /&gt; Few countries so far protect intersex people from discrimination, or provide access to reparations for harmful practices.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt;

A 2013 first international pilot study. [[Human Rights between the Sexes]], by [[Dan Christian Ghattas]], found that intersex people are discriminated against worldwide: "Intersex individuals are considered individuals with a «disorder» in all areas in which Western medicine prevails. They are more or less obviously treated as sick or «abnormal», depending on the respective society."&lt;ref name="ghattas"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/endf_human_rights_between_the_sexes.pdf | title = Human Rights Between the Sexes | first1 = Dan Christian | last1 = Ghattas | authorlink1 = Dan Christian Ghattas | last2 = [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]] | date = September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oiieurope.org/a-preliminary-study-on-the-life-situations-of-inter-individuals/ | title = A preliminary study on the life situations of inter* individuals | work = [[OII Europe]] | date = 4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations states that intersex people suffer stigma on the basis of physical characteristics, "including violations of their rights to health and physical integrity, to be free from torture and ill-treatment, and to equality and non- discrimination."&lt;ref name="unfe-fact" /&gt; The UN has called for governments to end discrimination against intersex people:
{{quotation|Ban discrimination on the basis of sex characteristics, intersex traits or status, including in education, health care, employment, sports and access to public services, and consult intersex people and organizations when developing legislation and policies that impact their rights.&lt;ref name="unfe-2016"&gt;{{cite web| title = United Nations for Intersex Awareness | url = https://www.unfe.org/intersex-awareness/ | last = Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights | authorlink = Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights | accessdate = 2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A handful of jurisdictions so far provide explicit protection from discrimination for intersex people. [[South Africa]] was the first country to explicitly add intersex to legislation, as part of the attribute of 'sex'.&lt;ref name="zagaz" /&gt; [[Australia]] was the first country to add an independent attribute, of 'intersex status'.&lt;ref name="com law" /&gt; [[Malta]] was the first to adopt a broader framework of "[[sex characteristics]]", through legislation that also ended modifications to the sex characteristics of minors undertaken for social and cultural reasons.&lt;ref name="gate-malta" /&gt; Since then, [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] has prohibited discrimination based on "sex characteristics",&lt;ref name="ilgaeurope"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ilga-europe.org/resources/news/latest-news/anti-discrimination-law-updated-bosnia-herzegovina | title = Anti-discrimination Law Updated in Bosnia-Herzegovina | work = [[ILGA-Europe]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lezbelib.com"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lezbelib.com/europe-news/lgbti-people-are-now-better-protected-in-bosnia-and-herzegovina | title = LGBTI people are now better protected in Bosnia and Herzegovina}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Greece]] has prohibited discrimination and hate crimes based on "sex characteristics" since 24 December 2015.&lt;ref name="et.gr"&gt;{{el icon}} {{cite web | url = http://www.et.gr/idocs-nph/search/pdfViewerForm.html?args=5C7QrtC22wE4q6ggiv8WTXdtvSoClrL8RZsdmVE36E95MXD0LzQTLWPU9yLzB8V68knBzLCmTXKaO6fpVZ6Lx9hLslJUqeiQ7YD-s2g-TGFc-ieGHzbhl8d9JIy5q3gnKRFHKgyKzGY | title = NOMOΣ ΥΠ’ ΑΡΙΘ. 3456 Σύμφωνο συμβίωσης, άσκηση δικαιωμάτων, ποινικές και άλλες διατάξεις}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Πρώτη φορά, ίσοι απέναντι στον νόμο"&gt;{{el icon}}{{cite web | url = http://www.efsyn.gr/arthro/proti-fora-isoi-apenanti-ston-nomo | title = Πρώτη φορά, ίσοι απέναντι στον νόμο}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Right to life ==

Intersex people face genetic de-selection via pregnancy terminations and [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]], as well as abandonment, neglect, infanticide and murder due to their [[sex characteristics]]. In 2015, the [[Council of Europe]] published an Issue Paper on ''Human rights and intersex people'', remarking:

{{quotation|Intersex people’s right to life can be violated in discriminatory “sex selection” and “preimplantation genetic diagnosis, other forms of testing, and selection for particular characteristics”. Such de-selection or selective abortions are incompatible with ethics and human rights standards due to the discrimination perpetrated against intersex people on the basis of their sex characteristics.&lt;ref name="coe"&gt;{{Citation| last1 = [[Council of Europe]]| last2 = Commissioner for Human Rights| title = Human rights and intersex people, Issue Paper| date = April 2015| url = https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=CommDH/IssuePaper(2015)1&amp;Language=lanEnglish&amp;Ver=original}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Healthcare ==
{{further information|Intersex medical interventions}}
In places with accessible healthcare systems, intersex people face harmful practices including involuntary or coercive treatment, and in places without such systems, infanticide, abandonment and mutilation may occur.&lt;ref name="carpenter2016" /&gt;

A 2016 Australian study of 272 people born with atypical sex characteristics found that 60% had received medical treatment on the basis of their sex characteristics, half receiving such treatments aged under 18 years, "most commonly genital surgeries (many of which occurred in infancy) and hormone treatments", and the "majority experienced at least one negative impact".&lt;ref name="oiidemo-2016"&gt;{{cite web|title = Demographics | url = https://oii.org.au/demographics/ | last = Organisation Intersex International Australia | authorlink = Organisation Intersex International Australia | date = July 28, 2016 | accessdate = 2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, while some parents and physicians had attempted to empower participants, the study found "strong evidence suggesting a pattern of institutionalised shaming and coercive treatment" and poor (or no) information provision.&lt;ref name="jonesbk2016" /&gt; 16% of study participants were not provided with information on options of having no treatment, and some were provided with misinformation about the nature of their treatment, and information about peer support was also lacking.

A Germany study conducted between 2005 and 2007 found that 81% of 439 participants had received surgical interventions due to their sex characteristics, and two-thirds of the adult participants in the study "drew a connection between sexual problems and their history of surgical treatment. Participating children reported significant disturbances, especially within family life and physical well-being – these are areas that the medical and surgical treatment was supposed to stabilize."&lt;ref name="cabral-2014"&gt;{{Cite book| editor1-first = Mauro | editor1-last = Cabral |editor2-first = Morgan | editor2-last = Carpenter | editor1-link = Mauro Cabral Grinspan | editor2-link = Morgan Carpenter | title = Intersex Issues in the International Classification of Diseases: a revision| date = 2014| url = http://intersexday.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/intersex_issues_in_the_international_classification_of_diseases-cabral-carpenter-2014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rationales for medical intervention frequently focus on parental distress, or problematize future gender identity and sexuality, and subjective judgements are made about the acceptability of risk of future gender dysphoria&lt;ref name="furtado"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Furtado P.

Human rights institutions question such approaches as being "informed by redundant social constructs around gender and biology"&lt;ref name="ahrc2015"&gt;{{Cite book| authorlink = Australian Human Rights Commission| isbn = 978-1-921449-71-0| last = Australian Human Rights Commission| title = Resilient Individuals: Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity &amp; Intersex Rights| location = Sydney| date = June 2015| url = https://www.humanrights.gov.au/our-work/sexual-orientation-sex-gender-identity/publications/resilient-individuals-sexual}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decision-making on any cancer and other physical risks may be intertwined with "normalizing" rationales. In a major Parliamentary report in Australia, published in October 2013, the Senate Community Affairs References committee was "disturbed" by the possible implications of current practices in the treatment of cancer risk. The committee stated: "clinical intervention pathways stated to be based on probabilities of cancer risk may be encapsulating treatment decisions based on other factors, such as the desire to conduct normalising surgery… Treating cancer may be regarded as unambiguously therapeutic treatment, while normalising surgery may not. Thus basing a decision on cancer risk might avoid the need for court oversight in a way that a decision based on other factors might not. The committee is disturbed by the possible implications of this..."&lt;ref name="SenateOnSterilisation" /&gt;

Despite the naming of clinician statements as "consensus" statements, there remains no clinical consensus about the conduct of surgical interventions,&lt;ref name="SenateOnSterilisation" /&gt; nor their evidence base, surgical timing, necessity, type of surgical intervention, and degree of difference warranting intervention.&lt;ref name="jpu2016"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.jpurol.2016.04.001| issn = 1477-5131| last1 = Mouriquand| first1 = Pierre D.

Photographs of intersex children's genitalia are circulated in medical communities for documentary purposes, and individuals with intersex traits may be subjected to repeated genital examinations and display to medical teams.

== Suicidality and self-harm ==

The impact of discrimination and stigma can also be seen in high rates of suicidal tendencies and self harm. Multiple anecdotal reports, including from Hong Kong and Kenya point to high levels of suicidality amongst intersex people.&lt;ref name="luk-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="odhiambo-2016" /&gt; The Australian sociological study of 272 people born with atypical sex characteristics found that 60% had thought about suicide, and 42% thought about self-harm, "on the basis of issues related to having an intersex variation ... 19% had attempted suicide"; causes identified included stigma, discrimination, "family rejection and school bullying.&lt;ref name="jones2016ed" /&gt;

A 2013 German clinical study found high rates of distress, with "prevalence rates of self-harming behavior and suicidal tendencies ... comparable to traumatized women with a history of physical or sexual abuse."&lt;ref name="schutzmann"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s10508-007-9241-9| issn = 0004-0002| volume = 38| issue = 1| pages = 16–33| last1 = Schützmann| first1 = Karsten| last2 = Brinkmann| first2 = Lisa| last3 = Schacht| first3 = Melanie| last4 = Richter-Appelt| first4 = Hertha| title = Psychological Distress, Self-Harming Behavior, and Suicidal Tendencies in Adults with Disorders of Sex Development| journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior| date = February 2009 | url = http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10508-007-9241-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar results have been reported in Australia&lt;ref name="schutzmann" /&gt; and Denmark.&lt;ref name="liao-2013" /&gt;

== Education ==

An Australian sociological survey of 272 persons born with atypical sex characteristics, published in 2016, found that 18% of respondents (compared to an Australian average of 2%) failed to complete secondary school, with early school leaving coincident with pubertal medical interventions, bullying on the basis of physical characteristics, and other factors.&lt;ref name="jones2016ed"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/14681811.2016.1149808| issn = 1468-1811 | pages = 1–17| last = Jones| first = Tiffany| title = The needs of students with intersex variations| journal = Sex Education| accessdate = 2016-05-28| date = March 11, 2016 | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14681811.2016.1149808}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Kenyan news report suggests high rates of early school leaving, with the organisation Gama Africa reporting that 60% of 132 known intersex people had dropped out of school "because of the harassment and treatment they received from their peers and their teachers".&lt;ref name="odhiambo-2016"/&gt;

The Australian study found that schools lacked inclusive services such as relevant puberty and sex education curricula and counselling, for example, not representing a full range of human bodily diversity. Only a quarter of respondents felt positive about their schooling experiences, and early school leaving peaked "during the years most associated with puberty and hormone therapy interventions".&lt;ref name="jones2016ed" /&gt; Cognitive differences may also be associated with some traits such as sex chromosome variations.&lt;ref name="hong-2014"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2790-13.2014| issn = 0270-6474| volume = 34| issue = 10| pages = 3509–3516| last1 = Hong| first1 = D.

== Poverty and employment discrimination ==

The impact of discrimination and stigma can be seen in high rates of poverty. A 2015 Australian survey of people born with atypical sex characteristics found high levels of poverty, in addition to very high levels of early school leaving, and higher than average rates of disability.&lt;ref name="jonesbk2016"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Open Book Publishers| isbn = 978-1-78374-208-0 | last1 = Jones| first1 = Tiffany| last2 = Hart| first2 = Bonnie| last3 = Carpenter| first3 = Morgan| last4 = Ansara| first4 = Gavi| last5 = Leonard| first5 = William| last6 = Lucke| first6 = Jayne| title = Intersex: Stories and Statistics from Australia| location = Cambridge, UK| accessdate = 2016-02-02| date = February 2016 | url = http://oii.org.au/wp-content/uploads/key/Intersex-Stories-Statistics-Australia.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6% of the 272 survey participants reported being homeless or couch surfing.&lt;ref name="jones2016ed" /&gt;

[[OII Europe]] states that "stigma, structural and verbal discrimination, harassment" as well as harmful practices and lack of legal recognition can lead to "inadequate education, broken careers and poverty (including homelessness) due to pathologisation and related trauma, a disturbed family life due to taboo and medicalisation, lack of self-esteem and a high risk of becoming suicidal."&lt;ref name="oiieu-2016"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://intervisibility.eu | title = European Intersex Visibility Works! | last = OII Europe | authorlink = OII Europe | accessdate = 2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1 September 2015, ''Discrimination (Jersey) Law 2013'' includes intersex status within its definition of sex. Sex is one of the prohibited grounds under the act, meaning that discrimination on this basis is prohibited. The act provides that:

{{quotation|"Sex" 
(1)      Sex is a protected characteristic.&lt;br /&gt; 
(2)      In relation to the protected characteristic – &lt;br/&gt;
(a)      a reference to a person who has that characteristic is a reference to a man, a woman or a person who has intersex status;&lt;br/&gt; 
(b)      a reference to persons who share the characteristic is a reference to persons who are of the same sex. &lt;br/&gt;
(3)      In this paragraph, a person has intersex status if the person has physical, chromosomal, hormonal or genetic features that are – &lt;br/&gt;
(a)      neither wholly male or female;&lt;br/&gt; 
(b)      a combination of male or female; or&lt;br/&gt;

=== Malta ===

In April 2015, Malta passed a ''Gender Identity Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act'' that protects intersex people from discrimination on grounds of "sex characteristics", and also recognizes a right to bodily integrity and physical autonomy.&lt;ref name="gigesc"&gt;{{Citation| last = Malta| title = Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act: Final version| date = April 2015| url = http://justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lp&amp;itemid=26805&amp;l=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===
In South Africa, the ''Judicial Matters Amendment Act, 2005'' (Act 22 of 2005) amended the ''[[Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act, 2000]]'' (Act 4 of 2000) to include intersex within its definition of sex.&lt;ref name="zagaz"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2005-022.pdf | title = Judicial Matters Amendment Act, No. 22 of 2005, Republic of South Africa, Vol. 487, Cape Town | date = 11 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex is one of the prohibited grounds under the act, meaning that unfair discrimination on the basis of sex is prohibited. The act provides that:

{{quotation|'intersex' means a congenital sexual differentiation which is atypical, to whatever degree;

=== United States ===

In May 2016, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] issued a statement explaining Section 1557 of the [[Affordable Care Act]] stating that the Act prohibits "discrimination on the basis of intersex traits or atypical sex characteristics" in publicly-funded healthcare, as part of a prohibition of discrimination "on the basis of sex".&lt;ref name="interact"&gt;{{Cite web| last = [[Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth|interACT]]| title = Federal Government Bans Discrimination Against Intersex People in Health Care| work = interactadvocates| accessdate = 2016-05-27| url = http://interactadvocates.org/federal-government-bans-discrimination-against-intersex-people-in-health-care/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ocr"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Office for Civil Rights (OCR)| title = Section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act| work = HHS.gov| format = Text| accessdate = 2016-05-27| date = 2016| url = http://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/section-1557/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
