For instance, Jim Crow laws regulated separate use of water fountains and separate seating sections on public transport. Jim Crow laws varied between communities and states. 

Most of the laws were passed from the [[1870s|1870's]] to the [[1890s|1890's]], as [[redeemers]] undid many of the reforms of the [[Reconstruction]] governments in the South, and ended  a brief period of African-American political power that began after the [[American Civil War]]. The 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]] had granted Blacks the same legal status as Whites. The [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in [[1896]] decision ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' that Jim Crow laws were constitutional as long as they allowed for [[separate but equal]] facilities.

The Jim Crow laws began to be repealed in the 20th century. The Supreme Court in ''Guinn v. United States'' ([[1915]]) ruled that an [[Oklahoma]] law that denied the right to vote to some citizens was unconstitutional.  In ''Buchanan v. Warley'' ([[1917]]), the Court held that a [[Kentucky]] law could not require residential segregation. However it was not until [[1954]], that the [[United States Supreme Court]] overturned ''Plessy v. Ferguson'' in the decision ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' of the City of Topeka in which the Court ruled that separate facilities were inherently unequal in the area of public schools. The modern [[civil rights movement]] is often considered to have begun in an act of [[civil disobedience]] against the Jim Crow laws when [[Rosa Parks]], an African-American woman, refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man.  This led to a series of legislation and court decisions in which Jim Crow laws were repealled or annuled.

The origin of the name 'Jim Crow' is disputed by some, but it seems most likely to come from the title character in a [[minstrel]] song (possibly written in [[1832]]) and popular from the mid-[[19th century|nineteenth century]] to the turn of the [[20th century|twentieth century]], but a number of other possibilities exist as well.

In conjunction with the laws there was also Jim Crow etiquette: a set of unwritten rules governing how Blacks and Whites should interact. Breaking of this code could result in a lynching ([[1878]]-[[1898]] saw 10,000 lynchings) or a even more sadistic murder ([[Sam Hose]] for example).
