'''Gerontophobia''' is the hatred or [[Fear processing in the brain|fear]] of the elderly, or a fear of age-related self-degeneration (similar to [[gerascophobia]]). The term comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] γέρων – ''gerōn'', "old man"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dge%2Frwn γέρων], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and φόβος – ''phobos'', "fear".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfo%2Fbos φόβος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; Gerontophobia that stems from a fear of aging has been linked to [[thanatophobia]], as fear of old age can be a precursor to fear of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Jacobsen |first1=Michael Hviid |title=Gerontophobia: The cultural roots of the old-age anxiety in contemporary society |date=2022 |url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003046790-4/gerontophobia-michael-hviid-jacobsen-adriana-teodorescu |work=Shaping Ageing |publisher=Routledge |doi=10.4324/9781003046790-4 |isbn=978-1-003-04679-0 |access-date=2022-03-27 |last2=Teodorescu |first2=Adriana|s2cid=246347774 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerontophobia can be caused by stereotypes of elderly people displayed in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2020-12-21 |title=The Manifestation of Gerontophobic Stereotypes in Russian Television - Media Watch Journal |url=https://www.mediawatchjournal.in/the-manifestation-of-gerontophobic-stereotypes-in-russian-television/ |access-date=2022-03-12 |language=en-US |doi=10.15655/mw/2020/v11i4/204638|s2cid=234538918 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ageism==
Discriminatory aspects of [[ageism]] have been strongly linked to gerontophobia. This irrational fear or hatred of the elderly can be associated with the expectation that someday all young people including oneself will be old inevitably and suffer from the irreversible health decline that comes with [[old age]], which is associated with [[disability]], [[disease]], and [[death]]. The sight of aged people could be a possible reminder of death (''[[memento mori]]'') and inevitable biological vulnerability. This unwillingness to accept these can manifest in feelings of hostility and discriminatory acts towards the elderly.

== History ==
Old age was previously seen as a golden age in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Burrow |first=J. A. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/610591940 |title=The ages of man : a study in medieval writing and thought |date=1986 |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=978-0-19-167098-5 |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |oclc=610591940}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the time of the Anglo-Saxons there was a shift towards more negative views of the elderly, which led to more and more literature developing a gerontophobic view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Porck |first=Thijs |date=2020 |title=Gerontophobia in Early Medieval England: Anglo-Saxon Reflections on Old Age |url=https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:44429/ |journal=Sense and Feeling in Daily Living in the Early Medieval English World |language=en-US |pages=219–235, 278–282, 287 |doi=10.17613/zbgk-yv52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Portrayal in literature and the media ==
Gerontophobia is heavily portrayed in literature and the media starting as early as Anglo-Saxon poetry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Porck |first=Thijs |date=2020 |title=Gerontophobia in Early Medieval England: Anglo-Saxon Reflections on Old Age |url=https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:44429/ |journal=Sense and Feeling in Daily Living in the Early Medieval English World |language=en-US |pages=219–235, 278–282, 287 |doi=10.17613/zbgk-yv52}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is also found in common literary classics such as [[Shakespeare]]'s [[King Lear]], [[Jonathan Swift]]'s [[Gulliver's Travels]], and [[Jane Austen]]'s [[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=1979-05-01 |title=Aging and the Elderly: Humanistic Perspectives in Gerontology, Aging and Income: Programs and Projects for the Elderly, Normal Psychology of the Aging Process and Old and Cold: Hypothermia and Social Policy |url=https://doi.org/10.1093/sw/24.3.258 |journal=Social Work |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=258 |doi=10.1093/sw/24.3.258 |issn=0037-8046}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerontophobia can also be found in many TV shows and movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sorokin |first=Gennadii G. |date=2020-12-01 |title=The Manifestation of Gerontophobic Stereotypes in Russian Television |url=https://www.mediawatchjournal.in/the-manifestation-of-gerontophobic-stereotypes-in-russian-television/ |journal=Media Watch |volume=11 |issue=4 |doi=10.15655/mw/2020/v11i4/204638 |s2cid=234538918 |issn=2249-8818|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatments for gerontophobia ==
Treatment for gerontophobia can include better education about the elderly and aging as well as an increase in exposure and insight therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=BUNZEL |first=JOSEPH H. |date=February 1973 |title=Recognition, Relevance and Deactivation of Gerontophobia: Theoretical Essay |url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-5415.1973.tb01222.x |journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=77–80 |doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.1973.tb01222.x |pmid=4688112 |s2cid=37352876 |issn=0002-8614}}&lt;/ref&gt;
