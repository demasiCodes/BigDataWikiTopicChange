'''Gerontophobia''' is the [[Fear processing in the brain|fear]] of age-related self-degeneration (similar to [[Gerascophobia]]), or a hatred or fear of the elderly due to [[memento mori]]. The term comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] γέρων – ''gerōn'', "old man"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dge%2Frwn γέρων], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and  φόβος – ''phobos'', "fear".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfo%2Fbos φόβος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ageism==
Discriminatory aspects of [[ageism]] have been strongly linked to [[gerontophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;Bunzel, J. H. "Note on the history of a concept-gerontophobia." Gerontologist 12:116-203.&lt;/ref&gt; This irrational fear or hatred of the elderly is associated with the fact that someday all young people including oneself will be old inevitably and suffer from the irreversible health decline that comes with [[old age]], which is associated with [[disability]], [[disease]] and [[death]]. The sight of aged people is a reminder of death (''[[memento mori]]'') and inevitable biological vulnerability. This unwillingness to accept these manifests in feelings of hostility and discriminatory acts towards the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, J., &amp; Levin, W. C. (1980). Ageism, prejudice and discrimination against the elderly (p. 94). Belmont, Calif.: Wadsworth Pub. Co..&lt;/ref&gt;
