'''Gender variance''', or '''gender nonconformity''', is behaviour or [[gender expression]] that does not conform to dominant [[gender norms]] of male and female.  People who exhibit gender variance may be called ''gender variant'', ''gender non-conforming'', or ''[[gender atypical]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas C. Halderman (2000), ''Gender Atypical Youth: Clinical and Social Issues.'' School Psychology Review, v29 n2 p192-200 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The terms ''gender variance'' and ''gender variant'' are used by scholars of [[psychology]]&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Carroll, Paula J. Gilroy, Jo Ryan (2002), ''Counseling Transgendered, Transsexual, and Gender-Variant Clients'', Journal of Counseling &amp; Development, Volume 80, Number 2, Spring 2002, pp. 131 - 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arlene Istar Lev, (2004) ''Transgender Emergence: Therapeutic Guidelines for Working With Gender-Variant People and Their Families.'' Haworth Press,  ISBN 978-0-7890-0708-7&lt;/ref&gt; and [[psychiatry]],&lt;ref&gt;Walter O. Bockting, Randall D. Ehrbar (2006), "Commentary: Gender Variance, Dissonance, or Identity Disorder?'' pp. 125 - 134 in "Sexual and Gender Diagnoses of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM): A reevaluation'' edited by [[Dan Karasic]] and [[Jack Drescher]], 2006, Haworth Press, ISBN 0-7890-3214-7 NB: Several articles in this book use the term "gender variance".&lt;/ref&gt; [[anthropology]],&lt;ref&gt;Serena Nanda (2000) ''Gender Diversity: Crosscultural Variations'', Illinois: Waveland Press, Inc., 2000 ISBN 1-57766-074-9  NB: Nanda uses the term "gender variance" to encompass gender phenomena in different cultures.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gender studies]], as well as advocacy groups of gender variant people themselves.&lt;ref&gt;"Gender Education and Advocacy (GEA) is a national [US] organization focused on the needs, issues and concerns of gender variant people in human society." Mission statement, available on the front page of the group's website: www.gender.org&lt;/ref&gt; 
The term ''gender-variant'' is deliberately broad, encompassing such specific terms as [[transsexual]], [[Butch and femme|butch]], [[Drag queen|queen]], [[sissy]], [[travesti]], [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] or [[tomboy]].

The word ''[[transgender]]'' is sometimes used interchangeably with ''gender-variant'',&lt;ref&gt;After defining transgender as  primarily "an umbrella term to describe those who defy societal expectations and assumptions regarding femaleness and maleness" including people who are transsexual, intersexual or [[genderqueer]], as well as [[cross-dressing|crossdressers]], [[drag (clothing)|drag performers]], masculine women and feminine men, Serano goes on to state: "I will also sometimes use the synonymous term ''gender-variant'' to describe all people who are considered by others to deviate from societal norms of femaleness and maleness". (p. 25), Serano, Julia (2007), ''Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity,'' Seal Press, 2007. ISBN 978-1-58005-154-5, ISBN 1-58005-154-5&lt;/ref&gt; but usually has a narrower meaning and somewhat different connotations, including a non-identification with the [[sex assignment|gender assigned at birth]]. The [[Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] (GLAAD) Media Reference Guide defines transgender as an "umbrella term for people whose gender identity and/or gender expression differs from the sex they were assigned at birth."&lt;ref name="GLAAD"&gt;Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. [http://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender ‘’GLAAD Media Reference Guide, 8th Edition. Transgender Glossary of Terms”], ‘’[[GLAAD]]’’, USA, May 2010. Retrieved on 2011-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all gender variant people identify as transgender, and not all transgender people identify as gender variant--many identify simply as men or women.

Gender identity refers to one's internal sense of being male, female, both, or neither. Gender expression is the external manifestation of one's gender identity, usually through "masculine," "feminine," or gender variant presentation and/or behavior.&lt;ref name="GLAAD"/&gt;

==Childhood gender variance==
{{Main|Childhood gender nonconformity}}

Multiple studies have suggested a correlation between children who express gender non-conformity and their eventually coming out as [[homosexuality|gay, bisexual]] or [[transgender]].&lt;ref name="Friedman 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumeister"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baumeister|first=Roy F.|title=Social Psychology and Human Sexuality: Essential Readings|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-84169-018-6|pages=201–2|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=roychiRaM8gC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=%22Childhood+Gender+Nonconformity%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=n0k4TNzJD4PQsAPOtqBR&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Childhood%20Gender%20Nonconformity%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some studies, a majority of those who identify as [[gay]] or [[lesbian]] self-report gender non-conformity as children. However, the accuracy of these studies have been questioned, especially within the academic community.&lt;ref name="Brookley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brookley|first=Robert|title=Reinventing the Male Homosexual: The Rhetoric and Power of the Gay Gene|year=2002|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-34057-3|pages=60–65|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bZrXrqaDfwoC&amp;pg=PT54&amp;dq="Childhood+Gender+Nonconformity"&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=n0k4TNzJD4PQsAPOtqBR&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD8Q66-}}&lt;/ref&gt; The therapeutic community is currently divided on the proper response to childhood gender non-conformity.

Although it is healily associated with homosexuality gender nonconformity is more likely to predict childhood abuse. A recent study illustrated that heterosexuals and homosexuals alike who do not express their gender roles according to society are more likely to experience abuse physically, sexually, and psychologically.&lt;ref&gt;"Andrea L.

==Social status for men vs. women==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}
Gender variance among men usually attracts more teasing, ostracism and violence than gender variance among women. Many sociologists who’ve studied this area of expertise believe this is because the female gender role and social status have been essentially devalued in conservative Western societies, and women traditionally been considered the lesser gender would have a male endanger his gender role and social status should he engage in gender variance. On the contrary, because the male gender role is usually praised and honoured in Western societies, women who engage in gender variance are tolerated and encourage because of their conversion to physical and social attributes which are more valued and appreciated in society. 

The social status for men and women exhibiting gender variance may also include their occupation and their preference of male and or female friends. Men typically have limited choices when it comes to choosing occupations, but are socially accepted when they select occupations that are traditionally viewed as male or unisex. In recent times, more men have gone above and beyond the expectations of socially acceptable occupations and preferences. More men are becoming male nurses, receptionists and stay-at-home dads. However, women who typically have more of a say when it comes to gender variance have far-reaching differences when it comes to occupations and preferences. Women, in recent times, are becoming involved in areas of expertise that have been traditionally viewed as male such as woodwork, engineering, sports and furthering their social status as equally powerful as the male, whereas a male can't typically do this without experiencing some social pressures.

When it comes to friends, men usually experience some difficulties when having a preferred preference or only having mostly female friends. This is because they are viewed by others reducing or associating their gender identity and social status with that of other women who have been considered the less significant gender, and studies have concluded that family, friends and community play a large impact on one’s identity and gender conformity. On the other hand, women who befriend males or have mostly male friends are viewed in a different light, being seen as ambitious and courageous to label their gender identity and social status with that of other men.

==Association with sexual orientation==
There are a number of differences between men and women when associating gender variance with sexual orientation. Gender roles in Western societies have impacted the way individuals address themselves in social circles and adapt their behaviour to avoid violence, rejection and ostracism. 

Among women, gender variance is occasionally associated with lesbianism. Women who dressed or modified their behaviour were traditionally labelled or believed to be a lesbian because of the restricted gender roles women were faced with in adulthood, such as a requirement of homemaking and reproducing. However in more recent times, women who exhibit gender atypical behaviour rarely experience social rejection or bullying as gender variance among women has become more socially acceptable and are more tolerated than men who display gender variance. Often girls who show behaviour not typical of their gender are more likely to be labelled as a tomboy. While conventional viewpoints consider a perceived correlation between tomboys and lesbianism, masculine behaviour typical of men and boys but displayed by women and girls is not a true indicator of one’s sexual orientation.  

For men, gender variance is usually repressed and punished. However, gender variance exhibited in childhood tends to diminish by adolescence, due to secondary sex characteristics and because of the limited identities men are faced with in adulthood. Heterosexual ideals of manhood include an interest in physically demanding activities, sports, technology, a muscular body shape and an interest in attracting a female romance or sexual partner. Providing protection and courage are among of the core aspects of the gender role of a male, and in turn a majority of women are often attracted to these features. This belief has also been stemmed from women being attracted to the stereotypical "[[bad boy (archetype)|bad boy]]" archetype, which has also been proven by women being attracted to men in prison populations. Therefore in hopes of succeeding in the last ideal of gender conformity, it is required for men to show and provide these qualities in order to expect or achieve a female romance or sexual partner. Homosexual and bisexual men, being less concerned with attracting women, are likely to conform to the ideals of manhood but have no interest in trying to impress or exhibit traits to attract women because social punishment for such transgression is not effective, or at least no more effective than being openly gay or bisexual in a heteronormative society (which they already experience). For that reason, the social rule for attracting women is only an expectation of heterosexual men.

==Clothing==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}
Among adults, the wearing of [[women's clothing]] by men is often socially stigmatized and [[sexual fetishism|fetishised]], or viewed as sexually abnormal. Yet, cross dressing may simply be a form of gender expression and is not necessarily related to erotic activity. It is also not indicative of sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. [http://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender ‘’GLAAD Media Reference Guide, 8th Edition. Transgender Glossary of Terms”], ‘’[[GLAAD]]’’, USA, May 2010. Retrieved on 2011-03-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Other gender nonconforming males prefer to simply modify and stylise men's clothing as an expression of their interest in appearance and [[fashion]].
