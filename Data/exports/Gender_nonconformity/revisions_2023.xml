'''Gender variance''' or '''gender nonconformity''' is behavior or [[gender expression]] by an individual that does not match masculine or feminine [[gender norms]]. A gender-nonconforming person may be variant in their [[gender identity]], being [[transgender]] or [[non-binary]], or they may be [[cisgender]]. In the case of transgender people, they may be perceived, or perceive themselves as, gender-nonconforming before transitioning, but might not be perceived as such after transitioning. Transgender adults who appear gender-nonconforming after transition are more likely to experience discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Social Costs of Gender Nonconformity for Transgender Adults: Implications for Discrimination and Health |journal=Sociological Forum |date=2015-09-01 |last1=Miller |first1=Lisa |last2=Grollman |first2=Eric Anthony |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=809–831 |doi=10.1111/socf.12193 |pmid=27708501 |url= |quote=gender nonconformity may heighten trans people's exposure to discrimination and health‐harming behaviors. Gender nonconforming trans adults reported more events of major and everyday transphobic discrimination than their gender conforming counterparts. That is, the more frequently trans people are read as transgender or gender nonconforming by others, the more they are subject to major and day‐to‐day discriminatory treatment. |pmc=5044929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, gender expression is the external manifestation of one's gender identity, usually through "masculine", "feminine", or gender-variant presentation or behavior.&lt;ref name="GLAAD" /&gt;

==In childhood==
{{Main|Childhood gender nonconformity}}

Multiple studies have suggested a correlation between children who express gender nonconformity and their eventually coming out as [[homosexuality|gay]], [[bisexual]], or [[transgender]].&lt;ref name="Friedman 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumeister"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baumeister |first=Roy F. |title=Social Psychology and Human Sexuality: Essential Readings |year=2001 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-1-84169-018-6 |pages=201–2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=roychiRaM8gC&amp;q=%22Childhood+Gender+Nonconformity%22&amp;pg=PA202}}&lt;/ref&gt; In multiple studies, a majority of those who identify as gay or [[lesbian]] self-report gender nonconformity as children.&lt;ref name="Friedman 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumeister" /&gt; However, the accuracy of some of these studies have been questioned.&lt;ref name="Brookley"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brookley |first=Robert |title=Reinventing the Male Homosexual: The Rhetoric and Power of the Gay Gene |year=2002 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-34057-3 |pages=60–65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bZrXrqaDfwoC&amp;pg=PT54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The therapeutic community is currently divided on the proper response to childhood gender nonconformity.

One study suggested that childhood gender nonconformity is [[heritable]].&lt;ref name="Friedman 2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Friedman |first=RC |title=Sexual Orientation and Psychodynamic Psychotherapy Sexual Science and Clinical Practice |year=2008 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-12057-9 |pages=53–7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwtokhymV_4C&amp;q=%22Childhood+Gender+Nonconformity%22&amp;pg=PA53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also been conducted about adults' attitudes towards nonconforming children. There are reportedly no significant generalized effects (except for a few outliers) on attitudes towards children who vary in gender traits, interests, and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10508-012-0023-7 |pmid=23150102 |title=Adults' Attitudes About Gender Nonconformity in Childhood |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=399–412 |year=2013 |last1=Thomas |first1=Rachel N. |last2=Blakemore |first2=Judith E. Owen |s2cid=22230241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children who are gender-variant may struggle to conform later in life. As children get older and are not treated for the mismatch between their minds and bodily appearance, this leads to discomfort, and negative self-image and eventually may lead to [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[suicide]], or [[self-doubt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/sep03/children.aspx |title=Understanding children's atypical gender behavior |last=Crawford |first=Nicole |date=2003 |website=American Psychological Association |access-date=2013-11-16 |archive-date=2013-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232347/http://www.apa.org/monitor/sep03/children.aspx |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a child is nonconforming at a very young age, it is important to provide family support for positive impact to family and the child.&lt;ref&gt;Peate, I.

British Journal of Nursing (mark Allen Publishing), 17, 17, 25&lt;/ref&gt; Children who do not conform prior to age 11 tend to have an increased risk for depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation as a young adult.&lt;ref name="Roberts, A. 2013"&gt;Roberts, A., Rosario, M., Slopen, N., et al.

Roberts et al. (2013) found that of participants in their study aged between 23 and 30, 26% of those who were gender nonconforming experienced some sort of depressive symptoms, versus 18% of those were gender-conforming.&lt;ref name="Roberts, A. 2013" /&gt; Treatment for [[Gender dysphoria|gender identity disorders]] (GID; now known as ''gender dysphoria'') such as gender variance have been a topic of controversy for three decades.&lt;ref name="zach"&gt;Hill, D., Rozanski, C., Carfagnini, J., &amp; Willoughby, B. (January 01, 2007). Gender identity disorders (GID) in childhood and adolescence. International Journal of Sexual Health, 19, 1, 57-75&lt;/ref&gt; In the works of Hill, Carfagnini and Willoughby (2007), Bryant (2004), "suggests that treatment protocols for these children and adolescents, especially those based on converting the child back to a stereotypically gendered youth, make matters worse, causing them to internalize their distress." Treatment for GID in children and adolescents may have negative consequences.&lt;ref name="zach" /&gt; Studies suggest that treatment should focus more on helping children and adolescents feel comfortable living with GID. There is a feeling of distress that overwhelms a child or adolescent with GID that gets expressed through gender.&lt;ref name="zach" /&gt; Hill et al. (2007) states, "if these youth are distressed by having a condition deemed by society as unwanted, is this evidence of a disorder?" Bartlett and colleagues (2000) note that the problem in determining distress is aggravated in GID cases because usually, it is not clear whether distress in the child is due to gender variance or secondary effects (e.g., due to ostracization or stigmatization).&lt;ref name="zach" /&gt; Hill et al. (2007) suggests, "a less controversial approach, respectful of increasing gender freedom in our culture and sympathetic to a child's struggle with gender, would be more humane."&lt;ref name="zach" /&gt;

Numerous studies confirm that LGBTQ+ students face increased instances of victimization in schools compared to their heterosexual peers, leading to lower well-being and academic performance. While research on gender variant adolescent school experience is limited, available findings indicate similar trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Vantieghem |first1=Wendelien |last2=Van Houtte |first2=Mieke |date=2020-01-02 |title=The Impact of Gender Variance on Adolescents' Wellbeing: Does the School Context Matter? |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00918369.2018.1522813 |journal=Journal of Homosexuality |language=en |volume=67 |issue=1 |pages=1–34 |doi=10.1080/00918369.2018.1522813 |issn=0091-8369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, understanding gender variance especially in young children, can be complex, making it challenging for social workers to empathize. Moreover, school social workers often work in environments that emphasize "heteronormativity" where femininity and masculinity are defined based on heterosexual relationships, making it difficult to address the needs of gender variant children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=de Jong |first=Dirk |date=June 2015 |title="He Wears Pink Leggings Almost Every Day, and a Pink Sweatshirt…."

==Social status for men vs. women==
Gender nonconformity among people assigned male at birth is usually more strictly, and sometimes violently, [[gender policing|policed]] in the West than is gender nonconformity among people assigned female at birth.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Skidmore |first1=W.

Some types of gender nonconformity, such as being a [[stay-at-home father]], may pass without comment whereas others, such as wearing lipstick and skirts, may attract stares, criticism, or questioning.

Gender nonconforming transgender people in the United States have been demonstrated to have worse overall health outcomes than transgender individuals who identify as men or women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lagos |first1=D. |date=2018 |title=Hearing Gender: Voice-Based Gender Classification Processes and Transgender Health Inequality |journal=Demography |volume=55 |issue=6 |pages=2097–2117 |doi=10.1007/s13524-018-0714-3 |pmid=30255426 |s2cid=52822267 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association with sexual orientation==
Gender norms vary by country and by culture, as well as across historical time periods within cultures. For example, in [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] tribes in Afghanistan, adult men frequently hold hands, without being perceived as gay, whereas in the West this behavior would, in most circumstances, be seen as proof of a homosexual relationship. However, in many cultures, behaviors such as crying, an inclination toward caring for and nurturing others in an emotionally open way, an interest in domestic chores other than cooking, and self-grooming can all be seen as aspects of male gender nonconformity.&lt;ref name="Friedman 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumeister" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brookley" /&gt; Men who exhibit such tendencies are often stereotyped as gay. Studies found a high incidence of [[gay males]] self-reporting gender-atypical behaviors in childhood, such as having little interest in athletics and a preference for playing with dolls.&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;[[J. Michael Bailey]], Joseph S. Miller, Lee Willerman; Maternally Rated Childhood Gender Nonconformity in Homosexuals and Heterosexuals, Archives of Sexual Behavior, Vol. 22, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The same study found that mothers of gay males recalled such atypical behavior in their sons with much greater frequency than mothers of heterosexual males.&lt;ref name="Bailey" /&gt;

For women, adult gender nonconformity is often associated with lesbianism due to the limited identities women are faced with in adulthood.&lt;ref name="Friedman 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumeister" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brookley" /&gt; Notions of heterosexual womanhood often require a rejection of physically demanding activities, social submission to a male figure (husband or boyfriend), an interest in reproduction and homemaking, and an interest in making oneself look more attractive for men with appropriate clothing, make-up, hairstyles and body shape.

Lesbian and bisexual women, being less concerned with attracting men, may find it easier to reject traditional ideas of womanhood because social punishment for such transgression is not effective, or at least no more effective than the consequences of being openly gay or bisexual in a [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] society (which they already experience). This may help account for high levels of gender nonconformity self-reported by lesbians.&lt;ref name="Friedman 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumeister" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brookley" /&gt;

Gender theorist [[Judith Butler]], in their essay ''Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory'', states: "Discrete genders are part of what humanizes individuals within contemporary culture; indeed, those who fail to do their gender right are regularly punished. Because there is neither an 'essence' that gender expresses or externalizes nor an objective ideal to which gender aspires."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Butler |first=Judith |date=1988-01-01 |title=Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory |journal=Theatre Journal |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=519–531 |doi=10.2307/3207893 |jstor=3207893}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butler argues that gender is not an inherent aspect of identity, further stating, "...One might try to reconcile the gendered body as the legacy of sedimented acts rather than a predetermined or foreclosed structure, essence or fact, whether natural, cultural, or linguistic".&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

Research into [[nonbinary]] gender identities has found this:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Comparing the health of non-binary and binary transgender adults in a statewide non-probability sample |journal=PLOS ONE |date=2019-08-27 |last1=Reisner |first1=Sari |last2=Hughto |first2=Jaclyn |volume=14 |issue=8 |pages=e0221583 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0221583 |pmid=31454395 |pmc=6711503 |bibcode=2019PLoSO..1421583R |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The overwhelming majority of non-binary respondents&amp;nbsp;... identified as having a sexual minority sexual orientation, which is also consistent with findings from other research. This substantial overlap between non-binary gender and sexual minority status is intriguing and supports the conceptualization that "non-traditional" gender identities (i.e., outside the gender binary) and sexual orientation are distinct yet interrelated constructs.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;Bisexual and gay male individuals who do not conform to traditional gender norms might experience increased discrimination compared to those who do. One study found Latino gay and bisexual men that identify as gender nonconforming faced higher levels of homophobia and psychological distress compared to their gender-conforming counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hart |first1=Trevor A. |last2=Noor |first2=Syed W. |last3=Tulloch |first3=Tyler G. |last4=Sivagnanasunderam |first4=Buvani |last5=Vernon |first5=Julia R.

This may be attributed to heightened mistreatment of boys displaying feminine traits, by parents and peers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Clothing==
Among adults, the wearing of [[women's clothing]] by men is often socially stigmatized and [[Transvestic fetishism|fetishized]], or viewed as sexually abnormal. However, [[cross-dressing]] may be a form of gender expression and is not necessarily related to erotic activity, nor is it indicative of sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.

==Gender-affirmative practices==
Gender-affirmative practices recognize and support an individual's unique gender self-identification and expression. Gender-affirmative practices are becoming more widely adopted in the mental and physical health fields in response to research showing that clinical practices that encourage individuals to accept a certain gender identity can cause psychological harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bryant |first1=Karl |title=Making gender identity disorder of childhood: Historical lessons for contemporary debates |journal=Sexuality Research and Social Policy |date=September 2006 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=23–39 |doi=10.1525/srsp.2006.3.3.23 |s2cid=144613679}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the [[American Psychological Association]] published gender-affirmative practice guidelines for clinicians working with transgender and gender-nonconforming people. Preliminary research on gender-affirmative practices in the medical and psychological settings has primarily shown positive treatment outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Guidelines for psychological practice with transgender and gender-nonconforming people. |journal=American Psychologist |date=2015 |volume=70 |issue=9 |pages=832–864 |doi=10.1037/a0039906 |pmid=26653312 |author1=American Psychological Association |s2cid=1751773}}&lt;/ref&gt; As these practices become more widely used, longer-term studies and studies with larger sample sizes are needed to continue to evaluate these practices.

Research has shown that youth who receive gender-affirming support from their parents have better mental health outcomes than their peers who do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ryan |first1=Caitlin |last2=Russell |first2=Stephen T. |last3=Huebner |first3=David |last4=Diaz |first4=Rafael |last5=Sanchez |first5=Jorge |title=Family Acceptance in Adolescence and the Health of LGBT Young Adults |journal=Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Nursing |date=November 2010 |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=205–213 |doi=10.1111/j.1744-6171.2010.00246.x |pmid=21073595 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender-affirmative practices emphasize gender health. Gender health is an individual's ability to identify as and express the gender(s) that feels most comfortable without the fear of rejection.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hidalgo |first1=Marco A. |last2=Ehrensaft |first2=Diane |last3=Tishelman |first3=Amy C. |last4=Clark |first4=Leslie F. |last5=Garofalo |first5=Robert |last6=Rosenthal |first6=Stephen M. |last7=Spack |first7=Norman P. |last8=Olson |first8=Johanna |title=The Gender Affirmative Model: What We Know and What We Aim to Learn |journal=Human Development |date=2013 |volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=285–290 |doi=10.1159/000355235 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender-affirmative practices are informed by the following premises:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

* gender variance is not a psychological disorder or mental illness
* gender expressions vary across cultures
* gender expressions are diverse and may not be binary
* gender development is affected by biological, developmental, and cultural factors
* if pathology occurs, it is more often from cultural reactions rather than from within the individual

Mental health practitioners have begun integrating the gender-affirmative model into [[cognitive behavioral therapy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Austin |first1=Ashley |last2=Craig |first2=Shelley L. |date=2015 |title=Transgender Affirmative Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: Clinical Considerations and Applications |journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=21–29 |doi=10.1037/a0038642}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[person-centered therapy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Person-Centered Counselling for Trans and Gender Diverse People |last=Hope |first=Sam |date=2020 |publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers |isbn=978-1-78592-542-9 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[acceptance and commitment therapy]].&lt;ref name="Stitt"/&gt; While taking different approaches, each therapeutic modality may prove beneficial to gender-variant people looking to self-actualize, cope with minority stress, or navigate personal, social, and occupational issues across their lifespan.

==Atypical gender roles==
{{see also|Gender role|Gender roles in non-heterosexual communities}}
Gender expectations, like other [[social norms]], can vary widely by culture. A person may be seen as expressing an atypical [[gender role]] when their [[gender expression]] and activities differ from those usually expected in that culture. What is "typical" for one culture may be "atypical" for another. People from cultures who conceptualize gender as polar opposites on a binary, or having only two options, may see cultures with [[third gender]] people, or fluid gender expressions, and the people who live in these gender roles, as "atypical". 
Gender expressions that ''some'' cultures might consider "atypical" could include:

* ''[[Househusband]]s'': men from [[patriarchal]] cultures who stay at home to raise children and take care of the home while their partner goes to work. [[National Public Radio]] reported that by 2015 this had risen to around 12.6% of heterosexual marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2015/02/08/384695833/what-happens-when-wives-earn-more-than-husbands |title=What Happens When Wives Earn More Than Husbands |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=February 8, 2015 |access-date=April 25, 2016 |archive-date=May 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507031749/http://www.npr.org/2015/02/08/384695833/what-happens-when-wives-earn-more-than-husbands |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would only be "atypical" in a culture where it is the norm for women to stay home.
* ''[[Androgynous]] people'': having a gender presentation that is either mixed or neutral in a culture that prizes polarised (binary) presentations.&lt;ref name="Stitt" /&gt;
* ''[[Crossdresser]]'': a person who dresses in the clothing of, and otherwise assumes, "the appearance, manner, or roles traditionally associated with members of the opposite sex".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Dual-role+transvestism |title=Dual-role transvestism |website=TheFreeDictionary.com |access-date=2019-05-18 |archive-date=2020-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801003752/https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Dual-role+transvestism |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crossdressers may be cisgender, or they may be trans people who have only socially transitioned without further medical intervention.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}
* ''[[Femminiello]]'': a population of people who embody a third gender role in traditional Neapolitan culture (southern Italy).
* ''[[Hijra (India)|Hijra]]'': a traditional third-gender person who is occasionally intersex, but most often considered male at birth. Many of the Hijra are [[eunuch]]s who have chosen to be ritually castrated in a dedication ceremony. They have a ceremonial role in several traditional South Asian cultures, often performing naming ceremonies and blessings. They dress in what is considered "women's" garments for that culture, but are seen as neither men nor women, but ''hijra''. 
* ''[[Khanith]]'': an effeminate gay male in [[Oman]]i culture who is allowed to associate with women. The clothing of these individuals must be intermediate between that of a male and a female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen O. |last=Murray |date=2002 |title=Homosexualities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GfH6Nc8HHFwC |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-55194-6 |page=278 |access-date=2019-03-08 |archive-date=2020-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801224922/https://books.google.com/books?id=GfH6Nc8HHFwC |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
