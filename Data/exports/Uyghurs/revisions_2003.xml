'''Uighurs''' (or '''Uigurs''' or '''Uygurs''') ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: Weiwur &amp;#32173;&amp;#21566;&amp;#29246; or &amp;#32500;&amp;#21566;&amp;#23572;  in [[pinyin]]: wei2 wu2 er3) are a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[ethnic group]] of people living in northwestern [[China]] -- mainly in the [[Xinjiang]] Uygur Autonomous Region, where they are the dominant ethnic group together with Chinese [[Han Chinese|Han]] people -- [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]. The other branch of Uighurs lives in [[Taoyuan county]] of [[Hunan]] province in Southcentral [[China]]. Uighurs form one of the [[List of Chinese ethnic groups|56 ethnic groups]] officially recognized by the [[People's Republic of China]].

They were the oldest and one of the most civilized [[Turkish language|Turkish]]-speaking peoples living in [[Central Asia]]. Renowned as '''Huihe''' (&amp;#22238;&amp;#32007; hui2 he2) in Chinese sources, they established a [[khanate]] in the [[8th century]] while taking over the power vacuum left by the [[Gokturk]]s. Huihe and Uighurs are in fact represented as the same ethnic group by their close pronunciation and numerous [[anthropology|anthropological]] [[evidence]]s.

They belonged to the [[Juan Juan]] from 460-545, and then to the [[Hephthalites]] from 541-565 before being taken over by the [[Gok Khaganate]].

They eventually gained a significant dominance over both China and other Turkic tribes. Eventually overrun by [[Kirghiz]] and [[Mongols|Mongol]] armies, they lost their [[independence]] around the end of the [[12th century]] and were annexed by several states, the most recent of which is China. 

Today, Uighurs are typically [[Muslims]]. Before Islam, Uighurs were [[Manicheanism| Manicheans]] or [[Buddhist]]s, and were, in fact, not quite Uighur. Today's Uighurs descend from the Turkic tribe as well as the pre-Turkic Indo-European-speaking [[Tocharians]] (or Tokharians). Today, one can still see light-skinned, -haired, and -eyed citizenry belonging the Uighur ethnic group.

Famous Uighurs include [[Wu'er kaixi]].
