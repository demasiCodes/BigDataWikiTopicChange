They were the oldest and one of the most civilized [[Turkish]] speaking people living in [[Central Asia]]. After establishing a kingdom in the [[8th century]], they gained a significant dominance on both China and other Turkic tribes. Being overrun by [[Kirghiz]] and [[Mongols|Mongol]] armies, they lost their independence about the ends of the [[12th century]] and were annexed by several states, the last of which is China.

'''Uighurs''' (or Uigurs or Uygurs) is just another romanization of Huihe (&amp;#22238;&amp;#32007; hui2 he2), a well-known tribe during [[Tang Dynasty]] since they are very close in pronunciation. This equivalence is also supported by numerous anthropological evidence.</rev></revisions></page></pages></query></api>
