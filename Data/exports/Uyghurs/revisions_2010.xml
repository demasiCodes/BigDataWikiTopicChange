==Identity==
[[File:KashgarNaan.jpg|thumb|left|A Uyghur [[naan]] baker]]
Throughout history, the term ''Uyghur'' has taken on an increasingly expansive definition. Initially a small coalition of [[Tiele people|Tiele]] tribes, it later denoted citizenship in the [[Uyghur Khaganate]]. Finally it was expanded to an ethnicity, whose ancestry derives from several distinct populations: including [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Tocharians|Tocharian]]. The fluid definition of ''Uyghur'' and the diverse ancestry of modern Uyghurs are a source of confusion about what constitutes true Uyghur [[ethnography]] and [[ethnogenesis]]. 

The first use of ''Uyghur'' as a reference to a political nation occurred during the interim period between the First and Second [[Göktürk]] Khaganates (AD 630-684).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Güzel |first= Hasan Celal |last2= Oğuz |first2= C. Cem |title= The Turks |place= Ankara |publisher= Yeni Türkiye |year= 2002 |volume= 2 |oclc= 49960917 |isbn= 9756782552}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern usage, ''Uyghur'' refers to settled Turkic urban dwellers and farmers of [[Kashgar]]ia or [[East Turkestan|Uyghurstan]] who follow traditional Central Asian sedentary practices, as distinguished from nomadic Turkic populations in [[Central Asia]]. The Bolsheviks reintroduced the term ''Uyghur'' to replace the previously used "[[Turkish people|Turk]]" or [[Turki]].&lt;ref&gt;The term "Turk" was a generic label used by members of many ethnic groups in Soviet Central Asia. Often the deciding factor for classifying individuals belonging to Turkic nationalities in the Soviet censuses was less what the people called themselves by nationality than what language they claimed as their native tongue. Thus, people who called themselves "Turk" but spoke [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] were classified in Soviet censuses as [[Uzbek]] by nationality. See Brian D. Silver, "The Ethnic and Language Dimensions in Russian and Soviet Censuses", in Ralph S. Clem, Ed., ''Research Guide to the Russian and Soviet Censuses'' (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1986): 70-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguist and ethnographer S. Robert Ramsey has argued for inclusion of two other ethnic groups, the [[Yugur]] and the [[Salar]], as subgroups of Uyghur (based on similar historical roots for the Yugur, and perceived linguistic similarities for the Salar). These groups are recognized as separate ethnic groups, though, by the Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ramsey |first= S. Robert |title= The Languages of China |publisher= Princeton University Press |year= 1987 |location= Princeton |pages= 185&amp;ndash;6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
The English transcription of the Uyghur [[ethnonym]] {{IPA|[ʔʊjˈʁʊː]}} is "Uyghur". Typically, it is pronounced {{IPA-en|ˈwiːɡər|}} by English speakers. Currently, several alternate spellings appear in literature: ''Uighur, Uygur'' and ''Uigur''.

The meaning of ''Uyghur'' is unclear. Several theories regarding its origin exist:
*"United Nine Tribes," a replacement for [[Tokuz-Oguzes|Tokuz-Oguz]] the tribal alliance of which the Uyghurs were part.&lt;ref&gt;Gumilev, L.N., ''"Ancient Turks"'', Moscow, 'Science', 1967, Ch. 27 http://gumilevica.kulichki.net/OT/ot27.htm&lt;/ref&gt;   
*The Chinese referred to Uyghurs by the ethnonyms ''Hoy-Hu'' ({{zh|c=回鵠|p=Húihú}}), ''Üan-Ga'' (Chinese:?; Pinyin:?), and ''Chiu Hsing'' ({{zh|c=九姓|l=the nine clans|p=jiǔ xìng}}).&lt;ref&gt;Gumilev L.N., ''"Hunnu in China"'', Moscow, 'Science', 1974, http://gumilevica.kulichki.net/HPH/hph16.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*Another suggested etymology is a composite of ''quick'' (Turkic:uigy) and ''man'' (Turkic:er/ir/ur) for ''Quick People''.&lt;ref&gt;M. Zakiev, 2003, ''Origin of Türks and Tatars'', pp. 54, 58, ISBN 5-85840-317-4, [http://s155239215.onlinehome.us/turkic/20Roots/ZakievGenesis/ZakievGenesis43-75En.htm in English].&lt;/ref&gt;
The earliest record of an Uyghur tribe is from the Northern [[Northern Wei Dynasty|Wei]] Dynasty (386-534 AD). At that time the ethnonym ''Gaoche'' ({{zh|c=高車|p=Gāochē|l=wheelwagon|links=no}}) to the [[Tiele people|Tiele]] tribes. Later, the term ''Tiele'' ({{zh|c=鐵勒|p=Tiělè|links=no}}; Turkic: Tele) itself was used.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some names (Dolans, Lopliks, etc. ) (刀郎人、罗布诺尔人（俗作罗布人）) refers to some division of Uyghurs, too.

Uyghur history can be divided into four distinct phases: Pre-Imperial (300 BC – AD 630), Imperial (AD 630–840), Idiqut (AD 840–1200), and Mongol (AD 1209–1600), with perhaps a fifth modern phase running from the death of the Silk Road in AD 1600 until the present. In brief, Uyghur history is the story of a small nomadic tribe from the [[Altai Mountains]] rising to challenge the Chinese Empire. After the collapse of the Uyghur Khaganate in AD 840, Uyghur resettled to the [[Tarim Basin]], merging with the existing [[Tocharians|Tocharian]] population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/a-meeting-of-civilisations-the-mystery-of-chinas-celtic-mummies-413638.html A meeting of civilisations: The mystery of China's Celtic mummies]&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the Uyghurs became civil servants administering the [[Mongol Empire]].

===Pre-Imperial (300 BC– AD 745)===
{{Main|Tiele people}}
The ancestors of the Uyghur tribe were Altaic pastoralists called [[Tiele people|Tiele]], who lived in the valleys south of [[Lake Baikal]] and around the [[Yenisei River]]. The Tiele first appear in history AD 357 under the Chinese ethnonym ''Gaoche'', referring to the ox-drawn carts with distinctive high wheels used for [[yurt]] transportation. Tiele tribal territories had previously been occupied by the [[Dingling]], an ancient Siberian people, some of whom had been absorbed into the Tiele. The Tiele practiced some minor agriculture and were highly developed metalsmiths due to the abundance of easily available iron ore in the Yenisei River.  

The Tiele were subjugated by the [[Xiongnu]] in c&amp;nbsp;300&amp;nbsp;BC, who put them to work manufacturing weapons. For this reason they have often erroneously been attributed a Xiongnu origin. After the collapse of the Xiongnu empire they were passed as vassal metalsmiths to the [[Rouran]] and [[Hepthalite]] States.&lt;ref&gt;Duan, "Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele", p. 325-326.&lt;/ref&gt;  

A Tiele tribe of twelve clans, the Fufuluo ({{zh|c=副伏罗|p=Fùfúluó|links=no}}) , gathered enough power to create a state, the A-Fuzhiluo kingdom (AD 481-520), in [[Dzhungaria]]. The Fufulo are often listed as Uyghur ancestors in Chinese history, famously in the ''[[Suishu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Suribadalaha, "New Studies of the Origins of the Mongols", p. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
{{quote|The forebears of the Tiele belonged to those Xiongnu descendants, having the largest divisions of tribes. They occupied the valleys, and were scattered across the vast region west of the [[Black Sea|Western Sea]] [Black Sea]

At the area north of the [[Tuul River|Duluo River]] (Tuul River), are the Pugu, Tongluo, Weihe (Orkhon Uyghur),&lt;ref&gt;Chronological names, Yuanhe (袁纥), Wuhu (乌护), Wuhe (乌纥), Weihe (韦纥), Huihe (回纥), Huihu (回鹘).&lt;/ref&gt; Bayegu, Fuluo (Fufuluo), which were all called Sijin (Irkin). Other tribes such as Mengchen, Turuhe, Sijie, Hun (Hunyu), Hu, Xue (Huxue) and so forth, also dwelled in this area. They had a 20,000 strong invincible army.

The names of these tribes differ, but all of them can be classified as Tiele. The Tiele do not have a master, but are subjected to the both Eastern and Western Tujue (Göktürks) respectively. They don't have a permanent residence, and move with the changes of grass and water. Their main characteristics are, firstly, they possessed great ferocity, and yet showed tolerance; secondly, they were good riders and archers; and thirdly, they showed greed without restraint, for they often made their living by looting. The tribes toward the west were more cultivated, for they bred cattle and sheep, but fewer horses. Since the Tujue had established a state, they were recruited as the auxiliary of empire and conquered both east and westward, annexing all of the northern regional lands. 

The customs of the Tiele and Tujue are not much different. However, a man of the Tiele lives in his wife's home after marriage and will not return to his own home with his wife until the birth of a child. In addition, the Tiele also bury their dead under the ground.|Suishu, 84}}

In AD 546 the Fufulo lead the Tiele tribes in a struggle against the Türk tribe in the power vacuum left by the breakup of the Rouran state. As a result of this defeat they were forced into servitude again. This incident marked the beginning of the historic Türk-Tiele animosity that plagued both [[Göktürk|Göktürk Khanates]].  (Note: at this time ''Tiele'' replaces ''Gaoche'' in Chinese history.)  At some point during their subjugation, nine Tiele tribes formed a coalition called [[Tokuz-Oguzes]] ''Nine-Tribes'' which also included the [[Xueyantuo]] (Syr-Tardush), [[Basmyl]], [[Oguz]], [[Khazar]] , [[Alans]], [[Kyrgyz]], [[Tuva]] and [[Yakuts|Yakut]] under the leadership of the Xueyantuo.&lt;ref name="Güzel 2002"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Güzel| first = Hasan Celal| last2 = Oğuz| first2 = C.

In AD 600 [[Sui]] China allied with Erkin Tegin, [[Bey]] of the Uyghur tribe, against the Göktürk Empire, their common enemy. This alliance was the first historical mention of the Uyghur tribe, which then resided in the [[Tuul River]] Valley with a population of 10,000 [[yurt]]s (~40,000 people).&lt;ref name="Güzel 2002"/&gt;  In AD 603 the alliance dissolved in the aftermath of [[Tardu Khan]]'s defeat, but three tribes came under Uyghur control: Bugut, Tongra and Bayirqu. 

In AD 611 the Uyghur led by the Xueyantuo defeated a Göktürk invasion; however, in AD 615 they were placed under Göktürk control again by [[Shibi Khan|Shipi Qaghan]]. In AD 627 the Uyghur, now led by Pusa Ilteber, participated in another Tokuz-Oguz revolt against the Göktürks, again spearheaded by the Xueyantuo tribe. In AD 630 the Göktürk Khanate was decisively defeated by the Emperor [[Tang Taizong]]. The Uyghur occupied second position after the Xueyantuo in the Tokuz-Oguz. However, in AD 646 when the Uyghur bey, Tumitu Ilteber (吐迷度) was granted the [[Government of the Han Dynasty#Local government|Chinese title Prefect]] ({{zh|c=刺史|p=cìshǐ|links=no}}) it established a legal precedent for Uyghur rule. He overthrew the Xueyantuo and established a short lived Uyghur state over the Mongolian steppe.  

From AD 648-657 the Uyghur, under Pojuan Ilteber (婆闰), worked as mercenaries for the Chinese in their annexation of the Tarim Basin. In AD 683 the Uyghur bey Tuchiachi was defeated by Göktürks and the Uyghur tribe moved to the [[Selenga River]] Valley. From this base, they struggled against the [[Göktürk|Second Göktürk Empire]].  

By AD 688 the Ugyhur were controlled again by the Göktürks. After a series of revolts coordinated with their Chinese allies, the Uyghur emerged as the leaders of the Tokuz-Oguz and Tiele once again. In AD 744 taking advantage of the power shift caused by the [[Battle of Talas]], the Uyghur, with their [[Basmyl]] and [[Qarluq]] allies, under the command of Qutlugh Bilge Köl, defeated Göktürks. The following year, they founded the Uyghur Khaganate at sacred Mount [[Ötüken]]. Control of Mt. Ötüken had been, since the Xiongnu, a symbol of authority over the Mongolian steppe.

===Uyghur Khaganate (AD 744–840)===
{{Main|Uyghur Khaganate}}
&lt;!-- Note: "744" was the Uyghur declaration of Uyghur Empire. "745" was the true final collapse of the Turkish empire. --&gt;
[[File:Old World 820.png|thumb|450px|Uyghur Khanate in geopolitical context c AD 820]]
Properly called the ''On Uyghur Toquz-Oghuz Orkhon Khanate'', the Uyghur Khaganate stretched from the [[Caspian Sea]] to [[Manchuria]] and lasted from AD 745 to 840.&lt;ref name="Güzel 2002"/&gt; It was administered from the imperial capital [[Ordu-Baliq]], the first city built in Mongolia. During the imperial phase, the term ''Uyghur'' ({{zh|c=维吾尔|p=Wéiwú'ěr|links=no}}) denoted any citizen of the Uyghur Khaganate, as opposed to the Uyghur tribe.  

Large numbers of [[Sogdiana|Sogdian]] refugees came to Ordu-Baliq to escape the Islamic conquest of their homeland. They converted the Uyghur nobility from Buddhism to [[Manichaeism]]. Thus, the Uyghurs inherited the legacy of Sogdian Culture. Sogdians ran the civil administration of the empire. They were helpful in outflanking the Chinese diplomatic policies which had destabilized the Göktürk Khaganate. In AD 840, following a famine and civil war, the Uyhgur Khaganate was overrun by the [[Kirghiz]], another Turkic people. As a result the majority of tribal groups formerly under Uyghur control migrated to what is now northwestern China, especially to the modern [[Xinjiang]] Uyghur Autonomous region.

Several laws enforcing racial segregation of foreigners from Chinese were passed by the [[Han chinese]] during the Tang dynasty. In 779 the Tang dynasty issued an edict which forced Uighurs in the capital to wear their ethnic dress, stopped them from marrying Chinese females, and banned them from pretending to be Chinese. Chinese disliked Uighurs because they practiced [[usury]] The magristrate who issued the orders may have wanted to protect "purity" in Chinese custom. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jqAGIL02BWQC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=chinese+uighurs+779+edict+lure+canton+836+foreigners+and+chinese+lu+governor+forbade+marriages+forced+separate&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SOTQTPwQgYGUB5OXibUM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=chinese%20uighurs%20779%20edict%20lure%20canton%20836%20foreigners%20and%20chinese%20lu%20governor%20forbade%20marriages%20forced%20separate&amp;f=false|title=The golden peaches of Samarkand: a study of Tʻang exotics|author=Edward H.

===AD 840 – 1600===
Following the collapse of the Uyghur Khaganate, the Uyghur gave up Mongolia and established kingdoms in three areas: present day [[Gansu]], [[Xinjiang]], and the [[Chu River]] the West of [[Tian Shan]] (Tengri-Tag) Mountains.

'''Yugor''', the easternmost of the three Uyghur states was the Ganzhou Kingdom (AD 870–1036), with its capital near present-day [[Zhangye]] in the [[Gansu]] province of China. There, the Uyghur converted from [[Manichaeism]] to [[Lamaism]] (Tibetan and Mongol [[Buddhism]]). Unlike other Turkic peoples further west, they did not later convert to Islam. Their descendants are now known as [[Yugurs]] (or ''Yogir'', ''Yugor'', and ''Sary Uyghurs'', literally meaning "yellow Uyghurs") and are distinct from modern Uyghurs. In AD 1028–1036, the Yugors were defeated in a bloody war and forcibly absorbed into the [[Tangut]] kingdom.

'''Karakhoja''', the most central of the three Uyghur states, was the Karakhoja Kingdom (created during AD 856–866), also called the "Idiqut" ("Holy Wealth, Glory") state, and was based on the cities of [[Turpan]] (winter capital), [[Beshbalik]] (summer capital), [[Kumul (city)|Kumul]], and [[Kucha]]. A Buddhist state, with state-sponsored Buddhism and Manicheism, it can be considered the center of Uyghur culture. The Idiquts (title of the Karakhoja rulers) ruled independently until 1209, when they submitted to the Mongols under [[Genghis Khan]] and, as vassal rulers, existed until 1335.

'''[[Kara-Khanid Khanate|Kara-Khanids]]''', or the Karakhans (Great Khans) Dynasty, was the westernmost of the three Uyghur states. The Karakhans (Karakhanliks) originated from Uyghur tribes settled in the [[Chu River]] Valley after 840 and ruled between 940–1212 in [[Turkistan]] and Maveraünnehir. They converted to [[Islam]] in 934 under the rule of [[Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan]] (920–956&amp;nbsp;AD) and, after taking power over [[Qarluks]] in 940, built a federation with Muslim institutions. Together with the [[Samanids]] of [[Samarkand]], they considered themselves the defenders of Islam against the Buddhist Uyghur Idiqut. The first capital of the Karahans was established in the city of [[Balasagun]] in the Chu River Valley and later was moved to [[Kashgar]].

The reign of the Uyghur's Karakhans is especially significant from the point of view of Turkic culture and art history. During this period mosques, schools, bridges, and caravansarais were constructed in the cities. Kashgar, [[Bukhara]] and [[Samarkand]] became centers of learning. During this period, Turkic literature developed. Among the most important works of the period is [[Kutadgu Bilig]] (English: "The Knowledge That Gives Happiness"), written by [[Yusuf Balasaghuni]] between the years 1060–1070, and Lughat-at-Turk(The Turkic dictionary) by Mahmud of Kashgar.

Both the Idiqut and the Kara-Khanid states eventually submitted to the [[Kara Khitai]]s. After the rise of the [[Seljuk Turks]] in Iran, the Kara-Khanids became nominal vassals of the Seljuks as well. Later they would serve the dual-[[suzerainty]] of the [[Kara-Khitans]] to the north and the Seljuks to the south. Finally all three states became vassals to [[Genghis Khan]] in 1209.

Most Uyghur inhabitants of the [[Ürümqi|Besh Balik]] and [[Turpan]] regions did not convert to Islam until the 15th century expansion of the [[Yarkent County|Yarkand]] Khanate, a Turko-Mongol successor state based in western Tarim. Before converting to Islam, Uyghurs were [[Tengriism|Tengriist]], Manichaeans, Buddhists, or [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] Christians.

====Chagatai Khanate====
{{Main|Chagatai Khanate}}

The '''Chagatai Khanate''' was a Mongol ruling [[khanate]] that initially inherited part of the [[Mongol Empire]] that comprised the Uyghur's land controlled by [[Chagatai Khan]] (alternative spellings ''Chagata'', ''Chugta'', ''Chagta'', ''Djagatai'', ''Jagatai''), second son of the [[Mongol]] emperor [[Genghis Khan]]. Chagatai's ''ulus'', or hereditary territory, consisted of the part of the [[Mongol Empire]] which extended from the [[Ili River]] (today in eastern [[Kazakhstan]]) and [[Kashgaria]] (in the western [[Tarim Basin]]) to [[Transoxiana]] (modern [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Turkmenistan]]). After the death of his father, he inherited most of what are now the five [[Central Asian Republics|Central Asian states]] and northern [[Iran]], which he ruled until his death in 1242. These lands later came to be known as the Chagatai Khanate, a descendant empire of the Mongol Empire after the latter's split. These territories would later become the [[Turco-Mongol]] states.

After the death of the Chagatayid ruler [[Qazan Khan]] in 1346, the Chagatai Khanate was divided into western ([[Transoxiana]]) and eastern ([[Moghulistan]]/[[Uyghuristan]]) halves, which was later known as "Kashgar and Uyghurstan," according [[Balkh]] historian Makhmud ibn Vali (''Sea of Mysteries'', 1640).

=== Mogulistan ===

By the year of 1348 mogul kings changed their religion together with 160,000 subjects, soon after which the word mogul came to denote Islamic people of Turkic origin. This led to their demarcation from other mogul people who were not Islamic, and was the beginning of the foundation of the Uyghur-Turkic empire called Mogulistan.

Kashgar historian Muhammad Imin Sadr Kashgari recorded the country Uyghurstan in his book ''Traces of Invasion'' (''Asar al-futuh'') in 1780. Power in the western half devolved into the hands of several tribal leaders, most notably the [[Qara'unas]]. Khans appointed by the tribal rulers were mere puppets. In the east, [[Tughlugh Timur]] (1347–1363), an obscure Chaghataite adventurer, gained ascendancy over the nomadic Mongols, and converted to Islam. In 1360, and again in 1361, he invaded the western half in the hope that he could reunify the khanate. At their greatest extent, the Chaghataite domains extended from the [[Irtysh River]] in [[Siberia]] down to [[Ghazni]] in Afghanistan, and from [[Transoxiana]] to the [[Tarim Basin]].

Tughlugh Timur was unable to completely subjugate the tribal rulers. After his death in 1363, the Moghuls left Transoxiana, and the Qara'unas' leader Amir Husayn took control of Transoxiana. Tīmur-e Lang (Timur the Lame), or [[Tamerlane]], a Muslim native of Transoxania who claimed descent from Genghis Khan, desired control of the khanate for himself and opposed Amir Husayn. He took Samarkand in 1366, and was recognized as [[emir]] in 1370, although he continued to officially act in the name of the Chagatai khans. For over three decades, Timur used the Chagatai lands as the base for extensive conquests, conquering the rulers of [[Herat]] in Afghanistan, [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]] in Persia, [[Baghdad]] in Iraq, [[Delhi]] in India, and [[Damascus]] in Syria. After defeating the Ottoman Turks at [[Battle of Ankara|Angora]], Timur died in 1405 while marching on [[Ming Dynasty]] China. The [[Timurid Dynasty]] continued under his son, [[Shah Rukh]], who ruled from [[Herat]] until his death in 1447.

By 1369, the western half (Transoxonia and further west) of the Chagatai Khanate had been conquered by [[Timur|Tamerlane]] in his attempt to reconstruct the Mongol Empire. The eastern half, mostly under what is now Xinjiang, remained under Chagatai princes that were at times allied or at war with Timurid princes. Until the 17th century, all the remaining Chagatay domains fell under the theocratic regime of Uyghur [[Apak Khoja]] and his descendant, the [[Khojijan]]s, who ruled [[East Turkestan]].

Both [[Transoxonia]] and the [[Tarim Basin]] of East Turkestan became known as [[Moghulistan]] or [[Mughalistan]], named after the ruling class of Chagatay and Timurid states which descended from the "Moghol"  tribe of Doghlat, but was completely Islamicized and Turkified in language. It was the same Moghol Timurid ruling class that established the Timurid rule on the Indian Subcontinent known as the [[Mughal Empire]].

Under the Chagatay Khanate's rule in East Turkestan/Uyghurstan, the culture of the Karakhanids(Uyghurs) became dominant of the largely Muslim state, that the [[Buddhist]] populations of the former Karakhoja(Uyghurs) Idikut-ate largely converted into the Muslim faith, and that all [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]]-speaking Muslims, regardless whether they lived in Turpan or Kashgar, became known by their occupations as [[Moghol]]s (ruling class), [[Sart]]s (merchants and townspeople) and [[Taranchi]]s (farmers). This triple division of classes among the same Muslim Turkic folk also existed in Transoxonia, regardless whether they were under Timurid or Chagatay, the sense of ethnic kinship between the modern Uyghur and [[Uzbek people]]s remain strong until today.

It is widely believed{{Who|date=July 2009}} that the modern Uyghur nation acquired its current demographic composition and its current cultural identity during the East Turkestani Chagatay period.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The Chagatay period in East Turkestan was marked by instability and internecine warfare kingdoms, with [[Kashgar]], [[Yarkant County|Yarkant]] and [[Qomul]] as major centers. Some Chagatay princes allied with the Timurids and Uzbeks of Transoxonia, and some sought help from the Buddhist [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk]]s. The Chagatay prince Mirza Haidar Kurgan escaped his war-torn homeland Kashgar in the early 16th century to Timurid Tashkent, only to be evicted by the invading [[Shaybanid]]s. Escaping to the mercy of his Mughal Timurid cousins, which was then rulers of Delhi, India, he gained his final post as governor of [[Kashmir]] and wrote the famous [[Tarikh-i-Rashidi]], widely acclaimed as the most comprehensive work on the Uyghur civilization during the East Turkestani Chagatay reign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://persian.packhum.org/persian/main?url=pf%3Ffile%3D05801031%26ct%3D0 PHI Persian Literature in Translation].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Khojijans were originally the [[Aq Tagh]] tariqa of the [[Naqshbandi]] order, which originated in Timurid Transoxonia. Struggles between two prominent Naqshbandi tariqas the [[Aq Tagh]]lik and the Kara Taghlik engulfed the entire East Turkestani Chagatay domain in late 17th century, which Apaq Khoja finally triumphant both as a national religious and political leader. The last ruling Chagatay princess married one of the ruling Khojijan princes (descendants of Apaq) and became known as Khanum Pasha. She ruled with brutality after the death of her husband, and singlehandedly slaughtered many of her Khojijan and Chagatayid rivals. She was known to have boiled alive the last Chagatayid princess that could have continued the dynasty. The Khojijan Dynasty fell into chaos despite the brutality of Khanum Pasha. 

During the [[Ming Turpan Border Wars]], the Chinese [[Ming Dynasty]] defeated invasions by the Uyghur Kingdom of Turpan.

The invading of the Manchu [[Qing Dynasty]] over the Jungars brought Manchu military governorship to the Ili Valley north of Tarim basin. Khojijan princes keep putting up struggle against Qing, until Qing was overturned by the [[Kuomintang]].

===Qing dynasty===
The [[Manchus]], semi-nomads from present-day [[northeast China]], vastly expanded the [[Qing dynasty|Qing empire]], which they founded in 1644, to include [[East Turkistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Asien_Bd1.jpg Map of China]&lt;/ref&gt; Qing dynasty invaded [[Dzungaria]] in 1759 and dominated it until 1864. The territory was renamed [[Xinjiang]], soon after the Qing invasion of the [[Dzungars]]. "Historians estimate that a million people were slaughtered, and the land so devastated that it took a generation for it to recover."&lt;ref&gt;Tyler, Christian. (2003). ''Wild West China: The Untold Story of a Frontier Land'', p. 55. John Murray, London. ISBN 0-7195-6341 0.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the Uyghurs revolted 42 times against Qing Dynasty rulers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In the revolt of 1864, the Uyghurs were successful in expelling the Qing Dynasty officials from [[East Turkistan]], and founded an independent [[Kashgaria]] kingdom, called '''Yettishar''' (English: "country of seven cities"). Under the leadership of [[Yakub Beg]], it included [[Kashgar]], [[Yarkent County|Yarkand]], [[Hotan]], [[Aksu, Xinjiang|Aksu]], [[Kucha]], [[Korla]] and [[Turpan]]. The kingdom was recognized by the [[Ottoman Empire]] (1873), [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]] (1872), and [[Great Britain]] (1874), which established a mission in the capital, Kashgar.

Uyghur Muslim forces under [[Yaqub Beg]] declared a Jihad against [[Hui people|Chinese Muslims]] under T'o Ming during the [[Dungan revolt]]. The Uyghurs thought that the Chinese Muslims were [[Shafi`i]], and since the Uyghurs were Hanafi that they should wage war against them. Yaqub Beg enlisted non Muslim Han Chinese militia under Hsu Hsuehkung in order to fight against the Chinese Muslims. T'o Ming's forces were defeated by Yaqub, who planned to conquer Dzungharia. Yaqub intended to seize all Dungan territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pEfWaxPhdnIC&amp;dq=t%27o+ming+yakub&amp;q=jihad#v=onepage&amp;q=religious%20war%20against%20the%20tungans%20also%20sunnis&amp;f=false|title=Late Ch'ing, 1800-1911|author=John King Fairbank, Kwang-ching Liu, Denis Crispin Twitchett|year=1980|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|isbn=0521220297|page=223|pages=754|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pEfWaxPhdnIC&amp;dq=t%27o+ming+yakub&amp;q=jihad#v=onepage&amp;q=hsu%20han%20militia&amp;f=false|title=Late Ch'ing|author=John King Fairbank, Kwang-ching Liu, Denis Crispin Twitchett|year=1980|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|isbn=0521220297|page=224|pages=754|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At [[Kuldja]] some Taranchi Turkic Muslims massacred Chinese Muslims, forcing them to flee into [[Ili]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gitcAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA5-PA35&amp;dq=soviets+defeated+by+tungans&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YuIiTPObAYSBlAe3scTHDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBjgK#v=snippet&amp;q=tungans%20taranchis%20massacred%20kuldja&amp;f=false|title=Accounts and papers of the House of Commons|author=Great Britain.

Large Qing (Manchu) Dynasty forces under the General [[Zuo Zongtang]] attacked [[Kashgaria]] in 1876. Fearing [[Tsarist]] expansion into East Turkestan, Great Britain supported the Qing invasion forces through loans by British banks (mostly through Boston Bank, located in [[Hong Kong]]). After this invasion, [[East Turkestan]] was renamed "Xinjiang" or "Sinkiang", which means "New Dominion" or "New Territory", by the Qing empire on November 18, 1884.

Meanwhile, the "Great Game" between Russia and Britain was underway in Central Asia, with former ethnic cultures from Afghanistan through Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to Uyghurstan, being divided. Artificial lines have been drawn between Shiite Persian speakers and Sunni Chagatay Turkic speakers within the same Uzbek cultural sphere and gave rise to the modern Tajik and Uzbek nationalities. Whereas the rather similar Sart-Taranchi populations around [[Kashgar]](Xinjiang) and [[Andijan]](Uzbekistan)  divided into the different ethnicities of Uyghur and Uzbeks, [[Turpan]], [[Qumul]], [[Korla]], [[Kashgar]], [[Yarkant County|Yarkant]], [[Yengisar County|Yengihissar]], [[Khotan]], [[Gulja]] through the Tarim Basin and the edges of Sinkiang, were recognized as Uyghur.

Throughout the Qing Dynasty, the sedentary Uyghur inhabitants of the oases around the Tarim speaking [[Qarluq]]/[[Old Uyghur]]-[[Chagatai language|Chagatay]] dialects, were largely known as [[Taranchi]], [[Sart]], ruled by their [[Moghul]] rulers of [[Khojijan]]. Other parts of the Islamic World still knew this area as [[Moghulistan]] or as the eastern part of [[Turkestan]].

Before being renamed 'Xinjiang' by Qing, this eastern part of Turkestan was more often known as Hui Jiang in Manchu, or "The Islamic territory".

The Europeans noted that Turki muslims (Uyghur) were poor, which would lead them to [[prostitute]] their daughters, while such a thing would never happen among Tungan muslims ([[Hui people|Chinese Muslims]]), which was why Turki prostitutes were common around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lThtAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=For+these+and+other+reasons+the+country+is+filled+with+Turki+prostitutes,+which+one+would+scarcely+ever+see+among+the+Tungan&amp;dq=For+these+and+other+reasons+the+country+is+filled+with+Turki+prostitutes,+which+one+would+scarcely+ever+see+among+the+Tungan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yTnQTNCCLMH6lwfTzbC1Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA|title=Bamberger Zentralasienstudien|author=Ingeborg Baldauf, Michael Friederich|year=1994|publisher=Schwarz|location=|page=352|isbn=3879972354|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republican era===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}
The Uyghur identified themselves to each other by their oasis, as 'Keriyanese', 'Khotanese', or 'Kashgari'. The Soviets met with the Uyghur in 1921 during a meeting of Turkic leaders in Tashkent. This meeting established the Revolutionary Uyghur Union (Inqilawi Uyghur Itipaqi), a communist nationalist organization that opened underground sections in principal cities of Kashgaria and was active until 1926, when the Soviets recognized the post Qing Sinkiang Government and concluded trade agreements with it. 

By 1920, Uyghur nationalism had already become a grave challenge to Chinese warlord [[Yang Zengxin]] (杨增新) controlling Sinkiang. [[Turpan]] poet [[Abduxaliq Uyghur|Abdulhaliq]], having spent his early years in Semey ([[Semipalatinsk]]) and the [[Jadid]] intellectual centres in Uzbekistan, returned to Sinkiang with a penname that he later styled as a surname: "Uyghur". He wrote the famous nationalist poem [[Oyghan]], which opened with the line "Ey pekir Uyghur, oyghan!" (Hey poor Uyghur, wake up!). He was later martyred by the Chinese warlord [[Sheng Shicai]] in [[Turpan]] in March, 1933 for inciting Uyghur nationalist sentiments through his works.

There were several Uighur factions during Yang's rule in Xinjiang, which did not intermarry and were fierce rivals. The Agtachlik faction always cut off the top of a melon and said [[bismillah]] before slicing it, and the less pious Qarataghliks (black mountain Uighurs) would slice up the melon without invoking the name of God. The Qarataghlik Uighurs were content to live under Chinese rule, while the Agtachlik Uighurs were hostile to Chinese rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=IAs9AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=andrew+forbes+warlords&amp;q=qarataghliks%20aqtaghlik|title=Warlords and Muslims in Chinese Central Asia: a political history of Republican Sinkiang 1911-1949|author=Andrew D.

Uyghur independence activists staged several uprisings against post Qing and Sheng-[[Kuomintang]] rule. Twice, in 1933 and 1944, the Uyghurs successfully regained their independence(backed by the Soviet [[Joseph Stalin]]): the [[First East Turkestan Republic]] was a short-lived attempt at independence of land around [[Kashgar Prefecture|Kashghar]], and it was destroyed by [[Hui people|Chinese Muslim]] army under General [[Ma Zhancang]] and [[Ma Fuyuan]] at the [[Battle of Kashgar (1934)]]. The Uyghurs had revolted with the Kirghiz who were another Turkic people. the Kirghiz were angry at the Chinese Muslims for crushing their [[Kirghiz Rebellion]] so they and the Uyghurs in Kashgar targeted Chinese Muslims for killing along with Han Chinese during their revolt. 

The Second East Turkistan Republic existed from 1944 to 1949  in what is now [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture]]. The [[Ili Rebellion]] was fought by the [[Kuomintang]] against the Second East Turkestan Republic, the Soviet Union, and the [[Mongolian People's Republic]].

The pro independence Uighurs were divided between pro Turkey and pro Soviet factions. Isa Yusuf Alpteklin witnessed rioting and fighting between the two.

===1949–present===
[[Image:Xinjiang nationalities by prefecture 2000.png|right|260px|thumb|Map of Xinjiang, the prefectures with Uyghur majority are in blue]]
In 1949, after the Chinese Nationalists ([[Kuomintang]]) lost the civil war in China, [[Second East Turkestan Republic]]'s rulers did not agree to form a confederate relation within [[Mao]]'s [[People's Republic of China]], however, a plane crash killed many of the East Turkestan Republic's delegation. The surviving leader, [[Saifuddin Azizi]], joined the [[Chinese Communist Party]] and professed loyalty to the PRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern China: an encyclopedia of history, culture, and nationalism|first=Ke-wen|last=Wang|year=1998|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterward, General [[Wang Zhen]] quickly marched on East Turkestan through the deserts, suppressing anti-invasion uprisings. Mao turned the Second East Turkistan Republic into the [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture]], and appointed Azizi as the region's first Communist Party governor. Many Republican loyalists fled into exile in Turkey and Western countries.

The name Xinjiang was changed to [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]], where they are the largest ethnic group and Uyghurs are mostly concentrated in the southwestern Xinjiang.&lt;ref&gt;2000年人口普查中国民族人口资料，民族出版社，2003/9 (ISBN 7-105-05425-5)&lt;/ref&gt;(see map, right)

==Uyghur nationalism==
[[Image:Uyghur protest in Munich 2008.jpg|150px|thumb|right|A Uyghur man protests in [[Munich]].]]

The Uyghur identity remains fragmented, as some support a [[Pan-Islamism|Pan-Islamic]] vision, exemplified in the [[East Turkestan Islamic Movement]]; some support a [[Pan-Turkism|Pan-Turkic]] vision, as in the [[East Turkestan Liberation Organization]]; and some would like a "Uyghur[[-stan|stan]]" state, as in the [[East Turkestan independence movement]]. As a result, "No Uyghur or East Turkestan group speaks for all Uyghurs, although it might claim to", and Uyghurs in each of these camps have committed violence against other Uyghurs who they think are too assimilated to Chinese or Russian society or not religious enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Constituting the Uyghur in U.S.-China Relations: The Geopolitics of Identity Formation in the War on Terrorism|first=Gaye|last=Christofferson|journal=[[Strategic Insights]]|publisher=Center for Contemporary Conflict|year=2002|month=September|volume=1|issue=7|url=http://www.nps.edu/Academics/centers/ccc/publications/OnlineJournal/2002/sept02/eastAsia.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindful not to take sides, Uyghur leaders like [[Rebiya Kadeer]] mainly try to garner international support for the "rights and interests of the Uyghurs", including the right to demonstrate, although the Chinese government has accused her of orchestrating the deadly [[July 2009 Ürümqi riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90002/96417/6695082.html|title=Unveiled Rebiya Kadeer: a Uighur Dalai Lama|date=2009-07-07|accessdate=2010-08-21|publisher=[[People's Daily]]|first=Li|last=Hongmei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently [[Rebiya Kadeer]] was banned from entering Taiwan for three years. She had been invited by a Taiwanese arts organization to attend screenings of ''The 10 Conditions of Love'', a documentary about her life story. Taiwan's Kuomintang ([[KMT]]) government claimed its rejection of Kadeer was "based on security needs." Kadeer said "it is unfortunate to see that KMT policy is increasingly mirroring Chinese policy on human rights. Under the Ma administration, all Chinese officials can freely travel to Taiwan. However, His Holiness the Dalai Lama was snubbed and I am prohibited from going there to attend a film screening." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/thor-halvorssen/taiwan-fails-to-learn-fro_1_b_684936.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter"Taiwan Fails to Learn From Its Own History"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Uyghur troops led by Hala were ordered by the Ming Emperor to crush [[Miao people|Miao]] rebellions and were given titles by him. Jian is the predominant surname among the Uyghur in Changde, Hunan. Another group of Uyghur have the surname Sai. [[Hui people|Hui]] and Uyghur have intermarried in the Hunan area, and the Hui were also used by the Ming Emperor to crush revolts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8ePxMW066j8C&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=jian+uyghur+hunan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-BO9TJ3BK4SBlAfLxZ2GDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Negotiating ethnicity in China: citizenship as a response to the state|author=Chih-yu Shih, Zhiyu Shi|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press,|location=|isbn=0415283728|page=133|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hui are descendants of Arabs and Han chinese who intermarried, and they share the Islamic religion withe the Uyghur in Hunan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8ePxMW066j8C&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=jian+uyghur+hunan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-BO9TJ3BK4SBlAfLxZ2GDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=islam%20is%20shared%20uygurs%20muslims%20arabs%20han&amp;f=false|title=Negotiating ethnicity in China: citizenship as a response to the state|author=Chih-yu Shih, Zhiyu Shi|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press,|location=|isbn=0415283728|page=135|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported that they now number around 10,000 people.

In addition to eating pork, the Uygurs of [[Changde]] Hunan practice other Han chinese customs, like ancestor worship at graves.

{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}

[[File:Khotan-mezquita-d03.jpg|thumb|[[Khotan Mosque|An Uyghur mosque]] in Khotan.]]
The relics of the Uyghur culture constitute major collections in the museums of [[Berlin]], [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Tokyo]], [[St. Petersburg]], and [[New Delhi]]. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, scientific and archaeological expeditions to the region of Uyghurstan's [[Silk Road]] discovered numerous cave temples, monastery ruins, and wall paintings, as well as valuable miniatures, books, and documents. Explorers from Europe, America, and Japan were amazed by the art treasures found there, and soon their reports caught the attention of an interested public around the world. The manuscripts and documents discovered in [[Xinjiang]] ([[Uyghurstan]]/[[Eastern Turkestan]]) reveal the very high degree of civilization attained by the Uyghurs. This Uyghur power, prestige, and civilization, which dominated Central Asia for over a thousand years, went into a steep decline after the [[Manchu]] invasion of their homeland.
Throughout the history of Central Asia, they left a lasting imprint on both the culture and tradition of the people of central Asia.

Chinese ambassador Wang Yande (939–1006), to the Karakhoja Uyghur Kingdom in AD 981–984:
"I was impressed with the extensive civilization I have found in the Uyghur Kingdom. The beauty of the temples, monasteries, wall paintings, statues, towers, gardens, housings and the palaces built throughout the kingdom cannot be described. The Uyghurs skilfully make things of silver and gold, vases and pitchers." {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

===Literature===
[[File:Kasgarlimahmut.jpg|thumb|[[Kashgarli Mehmud|Mähmut Qäşqäri]]]] 

Most of the early Uyghur literary works were translations of [[Buddhist]] and [[Manichean]] religious texts, but there were also narrative, poetic, and epic works.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Some of these have been translated into German, English, Russian, and Turkish. After the general population's conversion to Islam, world-renowned Uyghur scholars emerged and Uyghur literature flourished. Among hundreds of important works surviving from that era are [[Qutatqu Bilik]] (Wisdom Of Royal Glory) by [[Yusuf Balasaghuni|Yüsüp Has Hajip]] (1069–70), [[Kashgarli Mehmud|Mähmut Qäşqäri]]'s ''Divan-i Lugat-it Türk''- A Dictionary of Turkic Dialects(1072), and Ähmät Yüknäki's ''Atabetul Hakayik''. Perhaps the most famous and well loved pieces of modern Uyghur literature are [[Abdurehim Otkur]]'s ''Iz'', ''Oyghanghan Zimin'', [[Zordun Sabir]]'s ''Anayurt'' and [[Ziya Samedi]]'s (former minister of culture in Sinkiang Government in 50's) novels ''Mayimkhan'' and ''Mystery of the years''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Some Uyghur books have been translated into various Western languages.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

===Medicine===
The Uyghurs had an extensive knowledge of medicine and medical practice. Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] (906–960) sources indicate that an Uyghur physician named Nanto traveled to China and brought with him many kinds of medicine unknown to the Chinese. There were 103 different herbs used in Uyghur medicine recorded in a medical compendium by [[Li Shizhen]] (1518–1593), a [[Traditional Chinese medicine|Chinese medical]] authority. [[Tatar]] scholar, professor Reşit Rahmeti Arat in ''Zur Heilkunde der Uighuren'' (Medical Practices of the Uyghurs) published in 1930 and 1932, in Berlin, discussed Uyghur medicine. Relying on a sketch of a man with an explanation of acupuncture, he and some Western scholars suspect that acupuncture was not a Chinese, but an Uyghur discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Professor Reşit Rahmeti Arat, ''Zur Heilkunde der Uighuren'' (Medical Practices of the Uyghurs), Berlin (1930 and 1932).&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, traditional Uyghur medicine can still be found at street stands. Similar to other traditional medicine, diagnosis is usually made through checking the pulse, symptoms, and disease history, and then the pharmacist pounds up different dried herbs, making personalized medicines according to the prescription. Modern Uyghur medical hospitals adopted the Western medical science and medicine and adopted Western pharmaceutical technology to discover new and produce traditional medicines.

===Art===
[[File:Turpan-bezeklik-pinturas-d02.jpg|thumb|Wall painting at [[Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves|Bezeklik caves]] in Flaming Mountains, Turpan Depression.]] There are 77 [[Rock cut architecture|rock-cut]] caves at the site. Most have rectangular spaces with rounded [[arch]] [[ceiling]]s often divided into four sections, each with a [[mural]] of  [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The effect is of entire ceiling covers with hundreds of Buddha murals. Some ceilings are painted with a large Buddha surrounded by other figures, including Indians, Persians and Europeans. The quality of the murals vary with some being artistically naive while others are masterpieces of religious art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.showcaves.com/english/cn/misc/Bezeklik.html |title= Bizaklik Thousand Buddha Caves |publisher= ''www.showcaves.com'' |accessdate= 2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
[[File:Rubab.jpg|thumb|left|Dolan Rawabi(Rawab of [[Dolan]], a local musical instrument)]]
{{listen|filename=Chirayliq.ogg|title=Uyghur Pop|description=An example of modern Uyghur music}}
[[Muqam]] is the classical musical style. The '''12 Muqams''' are the national oral epic of the Uyghurs. The muqam system developed among the Uyghur in northwest [[China]] and [[Central Asia]] over approximately the last 1500 years from the Arabic [[maqama]]t modal system that has led to many musical genres among peoples of [[Eurasia]] and [[North Africa]]. Uyghurs have local muqam systems named after the oasis towns of [[Xinjiang]] ([[Eastern Turkestan]]), such as [[Dolan people|Dolan]], [[Ili]], [[Kumul (city)|Kumul]] and [[Turpan]]. The most fully developed at this point is the Western [[Tarim]] region's 12 muqams, which are now a large canon of music and songs recorded from the traditional performers [[Turdi Akhun]] and [[Omar Akhun]] among others in the 1950s and edited into a more systematic system. Although the folk performers probably improvised their songs as in Turkish [[taksim]] performances, the present institutional canon is performed as fixed compositions by ensembles.

Each of the 12 muqams (named ''Rak'', ''Čäbbiyat'', ''Segah'', ''Čahargah'', ''Pänjigah'', ''Özhal'', ''Äjäm'', ''Uššaq'', ''Bayat'', ''Nava'', ''Mušavräk'', and ''Iraq''), consists of a main section that begins with a long free rhythm introduction, followed by pieces with characteristic rhythmic patterns that gradually increase in speed. These pieces are arranged in the same sequence in each muqam, although not all muqams have the same pieces. These parts are known as ''täzä, nuskha, small säliqä, jula, sänäm, large säliqä, päshru'', and ''täkit''. Some have an associated instrumental piece known as a ''märghul'' ("decoration") following it. Although each named piece has its characteristic rhythmic pattern, the melodies differ, so each piece is generally known by the muqam and the piece: for example, "the Rak nuskha" or "the Segah jula".  

After the main section, there are two other sections, originally associated with other musical traditions, but included in muqams by performers such as Turdi Akhun and therefore included in the present 12 muqam tradition. The ''Dastan''&lt;ref&gt;http://aton.ttu.edu/turkishlist.asp&lt;/ref&gt; section includes songs from several of the romantic [[dastan]] narratives found widely in Central and South Asia and the [[Middle East]]. Each dastan song is followed by an instrumental märghul. The ''Mäshräp'' section consists of more lively dance songs that were originally connected with the performances of [[sama]] by [[dervish]] musicians of Turkistan.

The Uyghur Muqam of Xinjiang has been designated by UNESCO as part of the Intangible Heritage of Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?RL=21]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amannisa Khan]], sometimes called Amanni Shahan, (1526–1560) is credited with collecting and thereby preserving the Twelve Muqam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kashi.gov.cn/English/Tourism/Customs/12muqams.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[http://www.uyghurensemble.co.uk/ London Uyghur Ensemble]

Russian scholar Pantusov writes that the Uyghurs manufactured their own musical instruments; they had 62 different kinds of musical instruments and in every Uyghur home there used to be an instrument called a "[[dutar]]".
