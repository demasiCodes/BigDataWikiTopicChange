An other group of Uyghurs lives in [[Taoyuan county]] of [[Hunan]] province in Southcentral [[China]]. Uyghurs form one of the [[List of Chinese ethnic groups|56 ethnic groups]] officially recognized by the [[People's Republic of China]].

Along with the so-called Kok Turks (aka [[Gokturk]]s), the Uyghurs were one of the largest and most enduring [[Turkic]]-speaking peoples living in [[Central Asia]]. 
They existed as a tribal federation ruled by the [[Juan Juan]] from [[460]]-[[545]], and then by the [[Hephthalites]] from [[541]]-[[565]] before being taken over by the [[Gokturk]] [[Khanate|Khaganate]].
Known as '''Huihe''' (&amp;#22238;&amp;#32007; huíhé) and Huihu in Chinese sources, they established a [[khanate]] in the [[8th century]] when they displaced the [[Gokturk]]s.  Their [[ethnonym]] Huihu is the origin of the term Huihui (&amp;#22238;&amp;#22238;) used for Muslims which is now used for the [[Hui]] nationality in China.

Their Khaganate stretched from the Caspian Sea to Manchuria, and lasted from 745-840. when they were overrun by the [[Kirghiz]], with the result that tribal groups from the Uyghurs migrated to a number of new areas, including modern Xinjiang and Gansu regions and Central Asian steppes.  In Jungaria and the Tarim Basin they established the Idiqut kingdom which lasted until 1209 when they submitted to the [[Mongols|Mongol]] under [[Genghis Khan]].

Turks in the Western [[Tarim Basin]] began to convert to [[Islam]] in the [[10th century]], but most Uyghurs in the [[Besh Balik]] and [[Turfan]] regions did not convert until the 15th century expansion of the [[Yarkand]] Khanate, a Mongol successor state based in the Western Tarim. With conversion to Islam the traditional [[ethnonym]] Uyghur was dropped and the ancestors of modern Uyghurs identified themselves by the terms [[Turki]] and [[Musulman]].

Before converting to Islam, Uyghurs included [[Manichean]]s, [[Buddhist]]s and even some [[Nestorian]] Christians. Genetically and culturally, modern Uyghurs descend from the nomadic Turkic tribes as well as the many [[Iranian]] speaking groups such as [[Saka]] and [[Sogdian]]s who preceded them in the Tarim Basin oasis cities, and the [[centum]] Indo-European-speaking [[Tocharians]] (or Tokharians). Today, one can still see light-skinned, -haired, and -eyed citizenry belonging to the Uyghur ethnic group.

A small number of Uyghurs also migrated to what is now Gansu provence in China around the late 9th Century, where they converted from [[Manicheism]] to [[Tibetan Buddhism]] - unlike their kinfolk further west, they did not later convert Islam (and are thus unusual amongst Turkic people).   Their descendants still live there to this day where they are known as [[Yugur]]s (population approximately 10,000).

Famous Uyghurs include [[Abdurashid Khan]], [[Amannisa Khan]], [[Xiang Fei]] and [[Wu'er kaixi]].
