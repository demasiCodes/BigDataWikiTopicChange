==Name==
Uyghur is often pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|iː|g|ər}} by English speakers, though an acceptable English pronunciation closer to the Uyghur people's pronunciation of it would be {{IPAc-en|uː|.|i|ˈ|g|ʊr|}}.&lt;ref&gt;Reinhard F. Hahn, ''Spoken Uyghur,'' University of Washington Press, 2006, p. 4. ''Ui'' or ''uy'' is pronounced as in '(b)uoy'. See Michael Robert Drompp, ''Tang China and the collapse of the Uighur Empire: a documentary history,'' Brill, 2005, p. 7, n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several alternate romanizations also appear: ''Uighur, Uygur,'' and ''Uigur''. The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region provincial government recommends that the generic [[ethnonym]] {{IPA|[ʊjˈʁʊː]}}, adopted in the early 20th century for this [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people,&lt;ref&gt;J. Fletcher, "China and Central Asia 1368-1884," in J.K. Fairbank, (ed.) ''The Chinese World Order,'' Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1968, pp. 206–224, 337–368; p. 364, n. 90. Hakan Özoğlu, ''Kurdish notables and the Ottoman state: evolving identities, competing loyalties, and shifting boundaries,'' SUNY press, 2004, p. 16 cites Dru C. Gladney for the view that: "The ethnonym 'Uighur' was most likely suggested to the Chinese nationality affairs officials by Soviet advisors in Xinjiang in 1930."&lt;/ref&gt; be transcribed as "Uyghur."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.meshrep.com/wforum/viewtopic.php?t=13450 | title=Recommendation for English transcription of the word 'ئۇيغۇر'/《维吾尔》 | author = The Terminology Normalization Committee for Ethnic Languages of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region | date=11 October 2006 | accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of the term ''Uyghur'' is unclear. However, most Uyghur linguists and historians regard the word as coming from ''uyughur'' (''uyushmaq'' in modern Uyghur language), literally meaning 'united' or 'people who tend to come together'. Chinese [[Tang dynasty]] annals refer to them by the ethnonyms ''Huí Hú'' or ''Huí Hé''.&lt;ref&gt;Colin MacKerras, ''The Uighur Empire According to the T'ang Dynasty Histories,'' Australian National University, 1972, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; The etymology cannot be accurately determined, for historically the groups it denoted were not ethnically fixed, since it denoted a political rather than a tribal identity,&lt;ref&gt;Hakan Özoğlu, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; or was used originally to refer to just one group among several, the others calling themselves ''[[Toquz Oghuz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lilla Russell-Smith, ''Uygur patronage in Dunhuang: regional art centres on the northern Silk Road in the tenth and eleventh centuries.'' Brill, 2005, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Yin Weixian, the [[Old Turkic alphabet|Turkic runic]] inscriptions record a word ''uyɣur'', which was first transcribed into Chinese as ''Huí Hé'' (回紇), but later, in response to an Uyghur request, changed to ''Huí Hú'' (回鶻) in 788 or 809. 
The earliest record of an Uyghur tribe is from the [[Northern Wei Dynasty]] (386-534 AD). At that time the ethnonym ''Gaoche'' (in Uyghur: ''Qangqil'', قاڭقىل) ({{zh|c=高車|p=Gāochē|l=wheelwagon|links=no}}) to the Tura (Chinese: [[Tiele people|Tiele]]) tribes. Later, the term ''Tiele'' ({{zh|c=鐵勒|p=Tiělè|links=no}}; Turkic: Tele) itself was used.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; The first use of ''Uyghur'' as a reference to a political nation occurred during the interim period between the First and Second [[Göktürk]] Khaganates (630-684 CE). In modern usage, Uyghur refers to settled Turkic urban dwellers and farmers of Kashgaria or Uyghurstan who follow traditional Central Asian sedentary practices, as distinguished from nomadic Turkic populations in Central Asia. The Bolsheviks reintroduced the term ''Uyghur'' to replace the previously used [[Turkic peoples|Turk]] or [[Turki]].&lt;ref&gt;The term ''Turk'' was a generic label used by members of many ethnic groups in Soviet Central Asia. Often the deciding factor for classifying individuals belonging to Turkic nationalities in the Soviet censuses was less what the people called themselves by nationality than what language they claimed as their native tongue. Thus, people who called themselves "Turk" but spoke Uzbek were classified in Soviet censuses as Uzbek by nationality. See Brian D. Silver, "The Ethnic and Language Dimensions in Russian and Soviet Censuses", in Ralph S. Clem, ed., ''Research Guide to the Russian and Soviet Censuses'' (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1986): 70-97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, S. Robert (1987). ''The Languages of China''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, pp. 185–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history, the term ''Uyghur'' has taken on an increasingly expansive definition. Initially signifying only a small coalition of [[Tiele people|Tiele]] tribes in Northern China, Mongolia, and the [[Altay Mountains]], it later denoted citizenship in the [[Uyghur Khaganate]]. Finally it was expanded to an ethnicity, whose ancestry originates with the fall of the Uyghur Khaganate in the year 842 AD, which caused Uyghur migration from [[Mongolia]] into the Tarim Basin. This migration assimilated and replaced the [[Indo-European]]s of the region to create a distinct identity,&lt;ref name="Celtic"&gt;{{cite news|first =|last =|coauthors =|title = The mystery of China's celtic mummies|url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/a-meeting-of-civilisations-the-mystery-of-chinas-celtic-mummies-413638.html|work = [[The Independent]]|date = August 28, 2006|accessdate = 2008-06-28|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the language and culture of the Turkic migrants eventually supplanted the original Indo-European influences. This fluid definition of ''Uyghur'' and the diverse ancestry of modern Uyghurs are a source of confusion about what constitutes true Uyghur [[ethnography]] and [[ethnogenesis]].

Uyghur activists identify with the [[Tarim mummies]], but research into the genetics of ancient [[Tarim mummies]] and their links with modern Uyghurs remain controversial, both to Chinese government officials concerned with ethnic separatism, and to Uyghur activists concerned that research could affect their claims of being indigenous to the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?section=todaysfeatures&amp;xfile=data/todaysfeatures/2005/april/todaysfeatures_april37.xml |title=Genetic testing reveals awkward truth about Xinjiang's famous mummies |publisher=Khaleejtimes.com |date=2005-04-19 |accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/world/asia/19mummy.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first=Edward | last=Wong | title=The Dead Tell a Tale China Doesn't Care to Listen To | date=2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victor Mair has stated that the Uyghur peoples arrived at the Tarim Basin after the Orkon Uighur Kingdom (present-day Mongolia) fell around 842 AD.&lt;ref name="Celtic" /&gt;

===Origin of modern nationality===
The term "Uyghur" was not used to refer to any existing ethnic group in the 19th century; the "Uigur" people were referred to in the past tense, as an "ancient" people who no longer existed. For instance, a late 19th-century encyclopedia titled ''The cyclopædia of India and of eastern and southern Asia'' said that "Chinese Tartary" (Xinjiang) was at the time "occupied by a mixed population of Turk, Mongol, and Kalmuk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=t9krAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA952&amp;dq=According+to+Vambery,+the+Uigur+an'+the+most+ancient+of+the+Turk+tribes,+and+formerly+inhabited+a+part+of+Chinese+Tartary+which+is+no'+occupied+by+a+mixed+population+of+Turk,+Mongvi.+and+Kalmuk.+They+were+the+first+who+reduced#v=onepage&amp;q=According%20to%20Vambery%2C%20the%20Uigur%20an'%20the%20most%20ancient%20of%20the%20Turk%20tribes%2C%20and%20formerly%20inhabited%20a%20part%20of%20Chinese%20Tartary%20which%20is%20no'%20occupied%20by%20a%20mixed%20population%20of%20Turk%2C%20Mongvi.%20and%20Kalmuk.%20They%20were%20the%20first%20who%20reduced&amp;f=false|title=The cyclopædia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia: commercial, industrial and scientific, products of the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms, useful arts and manufactures|author=Edward Balfour|authorlink=Edward Balfour|year=1885|publisher=[[B.

Westerners called the Turkic speaking Muslims of the Oases "[[Turki]]", and the Turkic Muslims in Ili were known as "[[Taranchi]]". The Russians and other foreigners used the names "Sart",&lt;ref name="Benson1998" /&gt; "Turk", or "Turki"&lt;ref&gt;The term "Turk" was a generic label used by members of many ethnic groups in Soviet Central Asia. Often the deciding factor for classifying individuals belonging to Turkic nationalities in the Soviet censuses was less what the people called themselves by nationality than what language they claimed as their native tongue. Thus, people who called themselves "Turk" but spoke [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] were classified in Soviet censuses as [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] by nationality. See Brian D.

In current usage, ''Uyghur'' refers to settled Turkic urban dwellers and farmers of the [[Tarim Basin]] and [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture|Ili]] who follow traditional Central Asian sedentary practices, as distinguished from nomadic Turkic populations in [[Central Asia]]. However, the Chinese government has also designated as "Uyghur" certain peoples with significantly divergent histories and ancestries from the main group. These include the [[Loplik people]] and the [[Dolan people]], who are thought to be closer to the [[Oirats|Oirat Mongols]] and the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]].&lt;ref name="Dis"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dislocating China: Reflections on Muslims, Minorities, and Other Subaltern Subjects|first=Dru|last=Gladney|publisher=C.

==History==
[[File:Uighur Prince.jpg|thumb|left|An 8th century Uyghur Khagan]]
{{Main|History of the Uyghur people}}
Uyghur history can be divided into four distinct phases: Pre-Imperial (300 BC – AD 630), Imperial (AD 630–840), Idiqut (AD 840–1200), and Mongol (AD 1209–1600), with perhaps a fifth modern phase running from the death of the Silk Road in AD 1600 until the present.
After the collapse of the Uyghur Khaganate in AD 840, Uyghur resettled from Mongolia to the [[Tarim Basin]], assimilating the Indo-European population, which had previously been driven out of the region by the Xiongnu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/a-meeting-of-civilisations-the-mystery-of-chinas-celtic-mummies-413638.html |title=A meeting of civilisations: The mystery of China's Celtic mummies |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=2006-08-28 |accessdate=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancestors of the Uyghur tribe were Turkic pastoralists called [[Tiele people|Tiele]], who lived in the valleys south of [[Lake Baikal]] and around the [[Yenisei River]].

The '''[[Uyghur Khaganate]]''' stretched from the [[Caspian Sea]] to [[Manchuria]] and lasted from AD 745 to 840.&lt;ref name="Güzel 2002"&gt;{{Cite book |last= Güzel |first= Hasan Celal |last2= Oğuz |first2= C. Cem |title= The Turks |place= Ankara |publisher= Yeni Türkiye |year= 2002 |volume= 2 |oclc= 49960917 |isbn= 975-6782-55-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was administered from the imperial capital [[Ordu-Baliq]], one of the biggest ancient cities built in Mongolia. In AD 840, following a famine and civil war, the Uyghur Khaganate was overrun by the [[Kyrgyz people|Kirghiz]], another Turkic people. As a result the majority of tribal groups formerly under Uyghur control migrated to what is now northwestern China, especially to the modern [[Xinjiang]] Uyghur Autonomous region.

Following the collapse of the Uyghur Khaganate, the Uyghurs established kingdoms in present day [[Gansu]] and [[Xinjiang]].

'''Yugor''', the easternmost state formed by the [[Yugur people]], was the Ganzhou Kingdom (AD 870–1036), with its capital near present-day [[Zhangye]] in the [[Gansu]] province of China.

'''[[Kara-Khoja Kingdom]]''', this Uyghur state was the Karakhoja Kingdom (created during AD 856–866 near Turfan), also called the "Idiqut" ("Holy Wealth, Glory") state. The Idiquts (title of the Karakhoja rulers) ruled independently until the 1120s, when they submitted to the [[Qara Khitai]], then continued as vassal rulers under the Mongols from 1209.

'''[[Kara-Khanid Khanate|Kara-Khanids]]''', or the Karakhans (Black Khans) Dynasty, was a state formed by the a confederation of [[Karluks]], [[Chigils]], [[Yagma|Yaghma]] and other tribes in [[Semirechye]], Western [[Tian Shan]] and [[Kashgaria]], and who later conquered [[Transoxiana]]. 

The Uighur Idiqut, [[Baurchuk Art Tekin|Barchukh]], voluntarily submitted [[Genghis Khan]] (r.1206-1227) and was given his daughter, Altani (ᠠᠯᠲᠠᠨ).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas T. Allsen- The Yuan Dynasty and the Uighurs in Turfan in: Ed. Morris Rossabi, China Among Equals: The Middle Kingdom and Its Neighbors, 10th-14th centuries, pp. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chagatai Khanate was a Mongol ruling khanate controlled by [[Chagatai Khan]],  second son of Genghis Khan. Chagatai's ulus, or hereditary territory, consisted of the part of the [[Mongol Empire]] which extended from the Ili River (today in eastern Kazakhstan) and [[Kashgaria]] (in the western Tarim Basin) to [[Transoxiana]] (modern [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Turkmenistan]]). The exact date that the control of Turfan and other areas of Uighurstan was transferred to another Mongol Dynasty, [[Chagatai Khanate]], is unclear.).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas T. Allsen- The Yuan Dynasty and the Uighurs in Turfan in: Ed. Morris Rossabi, China Among Equals: The Middle Kingdom and Its Neighbors, 10th-14th centuries, pp. 258&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars claim Chagatai Khan (d.1241) inherited Uighurstan from his father, Genghis Khan, as [[appanage]] in the early 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Barthold- Four Studies, pp.43-53&lt;/ref&gt; By 1330s, the Chagatayids exercised the full authority over the Uighur Kingdom in Turfan.&lt;ref&gt;Dai Matsui-A Mongolian Decree from the Chaghataid Khanate Discovered at Dunhuang, p.166&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the death of the Chagatayid ruler Qazan Khan in 1346, the Chagatai Khanate was divided into western (Transoxiana) and eastern (Moghulistan/Uyghuristan) halves, which was later known as "Kashgar and Uyghurstan," according Balkh historian Makhmud ibn Vali (Sea of Mysteries, 1640). The Chagatayid Mongols of Moghulistan converted to Islam in 1359.

The [[Qing dynasty]] conquered Xinjiang in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Media:Asien Bd1.jpg|Map of China]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Beijing]], a community of Uyghurs was clustered around the Mosque near the Forbidden City, having moved to Beijing in the 1700s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Pk0UAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=ning+po#v=onepage&amp;q=mohammedan%20mosque%20turkestan&amp;f=false|title=China monthly review, Volume 8|author=|year=1919|edition=|editor=|publisher=Millard Publishing Co., inc.|page=64|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)]] of 1864, the Uyghurs were successful in expelling the Qing Dynasty officials from parts of southern Xinjiang, and founded an independent [[Kashgaria]] kingdom, called '''Yettishar''' (English: "country of seven cities"). Under the leadership of [[Yakub Beg]], it included [[Kashgar]], [[Yarkent County|Yarkand]], [[Hotan]], [[Aksu, Xinjiang|Aksu]], [[Kucha]], [[Korla]] and [[Turpan]].
Large Qing Dynasty forces under Chinese General [[Zuo Zongtang]] attacked [[Kashgaria]] in 1876.  After this invasion, the region, which had been known as the [[Xiyu]] special administrative area, was reorganized into a province named "Xinjiang", which when literally translated means "New Territory".

In 1912, the Qing Dynasty was replaced by the [[History of the Republic of China|Republic of China]]. By 1920, Pan-Turkic Islamists had become a challenge to Chinese warlord [[Yang Zengxin]] (杨增新) who controlled Siankiang.
[[Image:Xinjiang nationalities by prefecture 2000.png|right|260px|thumb|Map of Xinjiang, the prefectures with Uyghur majority are in blue]]
Uyghurs staged several uprisings against Chinese rule. Twice, in 1933 and 1944, the Uyghurs successfully regained their independence(backed by the Soviet Communist leader [[Joseph Stalin]]): the [[First East Turkestan Republic]] was a short-lived attempt at independence of land around [[Kashgar Prefecture|Kashghar]], and it was destroyed by [[Hui people|Chinese Muslim]] army under General [[Ma Zhancang]] and [[Ma Fuyuan]] at the [[Battle of Kashgar (1934)]]. The [[Second East Turkistan Republic]] was a Soviet puppet Communist state which existed from 1944 to 1949  in what is now [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture]].

Mao declared the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]] on October 1, 1949.
He turned the Second East Turkistan Republic into the [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture]], and appointed [[Saifuddin Azizi]] as the region's first Communist Party governor. Many Republican loyalists fled into exile in Turkey and Western countries.
The name Xinjiang was changed to [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]], where they are the largest ethnic group and Uyghurs are mostly concentrated in the southwestern Xinjiang.&lt;ref&gt;2000年人口普查中国民族人口资料，民族出版社，2003/9 (ISBN 7-105-05425-5)&lt;/ref&gt; (see map, right)

The Uyghur identity remains fragmented, as some support a [[Pan-Islamism|Pan-Islamic]] vision, exemplified in the [[East Turkestan Islamic Movement]], others support a [[Pan-Turkism|Pan-Turkic]] vision, as in the [[East Turkestan Liberation Organization]] and a third group would like a "Uyghur[[-stan|stan]]" state, as in the [[East Turkestan independence movement]]. As a result, "No Uyghur or East Turkestan group speaks for all Uyghurs, although it might claim to", and Uyghurs in each of these camps have committed violence against other Uyghurs who they think are too assimilated to Chinese or Russian society or not religious enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Constituting the Uyghur in U.S.-China Relations: The Geopolitics of Identity Formation in the War on Terrorism|first=Gaye|last=Christofferson|journal=[[Strategic Insights]]|publisher=Center for Contemporary Conflict|year=2002|month=September|volume=1|issue=7|url=http://www.nps.edu/Academics/centers/ccc/publications/OnlineJournal/2002/sept02/eastAsia.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindful not to take sides, Uyghur leaders like [[Rebiya Kadeer]] mainly try to garner international support for the "rights and interests of the Uyghurs", including the right to demonstrate, although the Chinese government has accused her of orchestrating the deadly [[July 2009 Ürümqi riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90002/96417/6695082.html|title=Unveiled Rebiya Kadeer: a Uighur Dalai Lama|date=2009-07-07|accessdate=2010-08-21|publisher=[[People's Daily]]|first=Li|last=Hongmei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==
The Uyghurs are a population with Eastern and Western Eurasian anthropometric and genetic traits. Uyghurs are thus one of the many populations of Central Eurasia that can be considered to be genetically related to European and East Asian populations.  However, various scientific studies differ on the size of each component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khazaria.com/genetics/uygurs.html |title=Uygur Genetics - DNA of Turkic people from Xinjiang, China |publisher=Khazaria.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study, using samples from Hetian ([[Hotan]]) only, found that Uyghurs have 60% European ancestry and 40% East Asian ancestry.&lt;ref name="ajhg"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shuhua Xu, Wei Huang, Ji Qian, and Li Jin  | title = Analysis of Genomic Admixture in Uyghur and Its Implication in Mapping Strategy |journal=Am J Hum Genet. | date=2008 April 11 | volume =  82 | issue = 4| pages =  883–89 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.01.017  |pmc=2427216 | pmid=18355773}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A further study showed slightly greater European component (52% European) in the Uyghur population in southern Xinjiang, but slightly greater East Asian component (47% European) in the northern Uyghur population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shuhua Xu and Li Jin  | title = A Genome-wide Analysis of Admixture in Uyghurs and a High-Density Admixture Map for Disease-Gene Discovery|journal=Am J Hum Genet. | date=September 2008 | volume =  83 | issue = 3 | pages =  322–36 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.08.001 |pmc=2556439 | pmid=18760393 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study used a larger sample of individuals from a wider area, and found only about 30% European component to the admixture.&lt;ref name="cite journal|pmc=2790568"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2790568|title=Genetic Landscape of Eurasia and "Admixture" in Uyghurs|year=2009|volume=85|issue=6|pmid=20004770|last1=Li|first1=H|last2=Cho|first2=K|last3=Kidd|first3=JR|last4=Kidd|first4=KK|pages=934–7; author reply 937–9|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.10.024|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study on [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup|mitochondrial DNA]] (therefore the matrilineal genetic contribution) found the frequency of western Eurasian-specific haplogroup in Uyghurs to be 42.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yao YG, Kong QP, Wang CY, Zhu CL, Zhang YP.  | title = Different matrilineal contributions to genetic structure of ethnic groups in the silk road region in China |journal=Mol Biol Evol. |date=Dec. 2004 | volume =  21 | issue = 12 | pages = 2265–80 |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/12/2265.long | pmid=15317881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The admixture may be the result of a continuous gene flow from populations of European and Asian descent, or may be formed by a single event of admixture during a short period of time (the hybrid isolation model). If a hybrid isolation model is assumed, it can be estimated that the hypothetical admixture event occurred about 126 generations ago, or 2,520 years ago assuming 20 years per generation.&lt;ref name="ajhg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2008/03/uyghurs-are-hybrids/ |title=Uyghurs are hybrids &amp;#124; Gene Expression &amp;#124; Discover Magazine |publisher=Blogs.discovermagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the paper by Li ''et al.''

{{Quotation|STRUCTURE cannot distinguish recent admixture from a cline of other origin, and these analyses cannot prove admixture in the Uyghurs; however, historical records indicate that the present Uyghurs were formed by admixture between Tocharians from the west and Orkhon Uyghurs (Wugusi-Huihu, according to present Chinese pronunciation) from the east in the 8th century CE. The Uyghur Empire was originally located in Mongolia and conquered the Tocharian tribes in Xinjiang. Tocharians such as Kroran have been shown by archaeological findings to appear phenotypically similar to northern Europeans, whereas the Orkhon Uyghur people were clearly Mongolians. The two groups of people subsequently mixed in Xinjiang to become one population, the present Uyghurs.|&lt;ref name="cite journal|pmc=2790568"/&gt;}}

==Culture==
[[File:Khotan-mezquita-d03.jpg|thumb|right|[[Khotan Mosque|An Uyghur mosque]] in Khotan.]]

Most Uyghurs are [[Sunni Muslim]].&lt;ref name="Palmer"/&gt;

===Education===
Uyghurs in China, unlike the [[Salar people|Salar]] and [[Hui people|Hui]] who are also mostly Muslim, generally do not oppose [[coeducation]] (grouping male and female students together).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=5bsZxAhzxk0C&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=sala+hui#v=snippet&amp;q=sala%20hui%20muslim%20girls%20coeducation%20uighur%20no%20problem%20frowned&amp;f=false|title=China's universities, 1895-1995: a century of cultural conflict|author=Ruth Hayhoe|year=1996|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=202|isbn=0-8153-1859-6|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, women are generally excluded from public Uyghur Muslim life, also in contrast to Salar and Hui practice.&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chinese Religious Life|first=David|last=Palmer|first2=Glenn|last2=Shive|first3=Philip|last3=Wickeri|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
Most of the early Uyghur literary works were translations of [[Buddhist]] and [[Manichean]] religious texts, but there were also narrative, poetic, and epic works apparently original to the Uyghurs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Some of these have been translated into German, English, Russian, and Turkish. Among hundreds of important works surviving from that era are [[Qutatqu Bilik]] (Wisdom Of Royal Glory) by [[Yusuf Balasaghuni|Yüsüp Has Hajip]] (1069–70), [[Kashgarli Mehmud|Mähmut Qäşqäri]]'s ''Divan-i Lugat-it Türk''- A Dictionary of Turkic Dialects(1072), and Ähmät Yüknäki's ''Atabetul Hakayik''. Perhaps the most famous and best loved pieces of modern Uyghur literature are [[Abdurehim Otkur]]'s ''Iz'', ''Oyghanghan Zimin'', [[Zordun Sabir]]'s ''Anayurt'' and [[Ziya Samedi]]'s (former minister of culture in Sinkiang Government in 50's) novels ''Mayimkhan'' and ''Mystery of the years''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===Medicine===
Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] (906–960) sources indicate that an Uyghur physician named Nanto traveled to China and brought with him many kinds of medicine unknown to the Chinese. There were 103 herbs used in Uyghur medicine recorded in a medical compendium by [[Li Shizhen]] (1518–1593), a [[Traditional Chinese medicine|Chinese medical]] authority. Today, traditional Uyghur medicine can still be found at street stands. Similar to other traditional medicine, diagnosis is usually made through checking the pulse, symptoms, and disease history, and then the pharmacist pounds up different dried herbs, making personalized medicines according to the prescription. Modern Uyghur medical hospitals adopted modern medical science and medicine and adopted evidence-based pharmaceutical technology to traditional medicines.

===Art===
[[File:Turpan-bezeklik-pinturas-d02.jpg|thumb|Wall painting at [[Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves|Bezeklik caves]] in Flaming Mountains, Turpan Depression.]]
[[File:Khotan-fabrica-alfombras-d09.jpg|thumb|left|Xinjiang carpet factory]]During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, scientific and archaeological expeditions to the region of Xinjiang's [[Silk Road]] discovered numerous cave temples, monastery ruins, and wall paintings, as well as miniatures, books, and documents. There are 77 [[Rock cut architecture|rock-cut]] caves at the site. Most have rectangular spaces with rounded [[arch]] [[ceiling]]s often divided into four sections, each with a [[mural]] of  [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The effect is of an entire ceiling covered with hundreds of Buddha murals. Some ceilings are painted with a large Buddha surrounded by other figures, including Indians, Persians and Europeans. The quality of the murals vary with some being artistically naive while others are masterpieces of religious art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.showcaves.com/english/cn/misc/Bezeklik.html |title= Bizaklik Thousand Buddha Caves |publisher= ''www.showcaves.com'' |accessdate= 2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{listen|filename=Chirayliq.ogg|title=Uyghur Pop|description=An example of modern Uyghur music}}
[[Muqam]] is the classical musical style. The '''12 Muqams''' are the national oral epic of the Uyghurs. The muqam system developed among the Uyghur in northwest [[China]] and [[Central Asia]] over approximately the last 1500 years from the Arabic [[maqama]]t modal system that has led to many musical genres among peoples of [[Eurasia]] and [[North Africa]]. Uyghurs have local muqam systems named after the oasis towns of [[Xinjiang]], such as [[Dolan people|Dolan]], [[Ghulja|Ili]], [[Kumul (city)|Kumul]] and [[Turpan]]. The most fully developed at this point is the Western [[Tarim Basin|Tarim]] region's 12 muqams, which are now a large canon of music and songs recorded from the traditional performers [[Turdi Akhun]] and [[Omar Akhun]] among others in the 1950s and edited into a more systematic system. Although the folk performers probably improvised their songs as in Turkish [[Taqsim|taksim]] performances, the present institutional canon is performed as fixed compositions by ensembles.

The Uyghur Muqam of Xinjiang has been designated by UNESCO as part of the Intangible Heritage of Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?RL=21 |title=UNESCO Culture Sector - Intangible Heritage - 2003 Convention : |publisher=Unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amannisa Khan]], sometimes called Amanni Shahan, (1526–1560) is credited with collecting and thereby preserving the Twelve Muqam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kashi.gov.cn/English/Tourism/Customs/12muqams.htm |title=Kashgar Welcome You! |publisher=Kashi.gov.cn |date= |accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian scholar Pantusov writes that the Uyghurs manufactured their own musical instruments; they had 62 different kinds of musical instruments and in every Uyghur home there used to be an instrument called a "[[dutar]]".

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Xinjiang cuisine}}
[[File:Uyghur polu closeup.JPG|thumb|Uyghur [[pilaf]] (پولۇ)]]
Uyghur food (''Uyghur Yemekliri'') is characterized by [[mutton]], [[beef]], [[camel]], [[chicken]], [[goose]], [[carrot]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[onion]]s, [[eggplant]], [[celery]], various [[dairy foods]], and [[fruit]]s.

Uyghur-style breakfast is [[tea]] with home-baked [[bread]], [[hardened yogurt]], [[olive]]s, [[honey]], [[raisin]]s, and [[almond]]s. Uyghurs like to treat guests with tea, [[naan]] and fruit before the main dishes are ready.

''[[Sangza]]'' ([[Uyghur language|Uyghur]]: ساڭزا) are crispy and tasty fried [[wheat flour]] dough twists, a holiday specialty.  ''[[Samsa]]'' ([[Uyghur language|Uyghur]]: سامسا) are lamb [[pie]]s baked using a special brick oven.
''[[Youtazi]]'' is steamed multilayer bread. ''[[Göshnan]]'' ([[Uyghur language|Uyghur]]: گۆشنان) are pan-grilled lamb pies. ''[[Pamirdin]]'' are baked pies with lamb, carrots, and onion inside. ''[[Xurpa]]'' is lamb [[soup]] ([[Uyghur language|Uyghur]]: شۇرپا). Other dishes include ''[[Tohax]]'', a different type of baked bread, and ''[[Doner kebab|Tunurkawab]].''
