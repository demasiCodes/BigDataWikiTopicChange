==Name==
''Uyghur'' is often pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|iː|g|ər}} by English speakers, though an acceptable English pronunciation closer to the Uyghur people's pronunciation of it would be {{IPAc-en|uː|.|i|ˈ|g|ʊr|}}.&lt;ref&gt;Reinhard F. Hahn, ''Spoken Uyghur,'' University of Washington Press, 2006, p. 4. ''Ui'' or ''uy'' is pronounced as in '(b)uoy'. See Michael Robert Drompp, ''Tang China and the collapse of the Uighur Empire: a documentary history,'' Brill, 2005, p. 7, n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Several alternate romanizations also appear: ''Uighur, Uygur,'' and ''Uigur''. The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region provincial government recommends that the generic [[ethnonym]] {{IPA|[ʊjˈʁʊː]}}, adopted in the early 20th century for this [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people,&lt;ref&gt;J. Fletcher, "China and Central Asia 1368–1884", in J.K. Fairbank, (ed.) ''The Chinese World Order,'' Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1968, pp. 206–224, 337–368; p. 364, n. 90. Hakan Özoğlu, ''Kurdish notables and the Ottoman state: evolving identities, competing loyalties, and shifting boundaries,'' SUNY press, 2004, p. 16 cites Dru C. Gladney for the view that: "The ethnonym 'Uighur' was most likely suggested to the Chinese nationality affairs officials by Soviet advisors in Xinjiang in 1930."&lt;/ref&gt; be transcribed as "Uyghur".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.meshrep.com/wforum/viewtopic.php?t=13450 | title=Recommendation for English transcription of the word 'ئۇيغۇر'/《维吾尔》 | author = The Terminology Normalization Committee for Ethnic Languages of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region | date=11 October 2006 | accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of the term ''Uyghur'' is unclear. Most Uyghur linguists and historians regard the word as coming from ''uyughur'' (''uyushmaq'' in modern Uyghur language), literally meaning 'united' or 'people who tend to come together'. The [[Old Turkic alphabet|Turkic runic]] inscriptions record a word ''uyɣur'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hzsnT67gykkC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Uygur Patronage In Dunhuang: Regional Art Centres On The Northern Silk Road |author= Lilla Russell-Smith |year=2005|page= 33 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-14241-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  which was transcribed into Chinese as ''Huíhé'' (回紇) in  Chinese [[Tang dynasty]] annals.&lt;ref&gt;Colin MacKerras, ''The Uighur Empire According to the T'ang Dynasty Histories,'' Australian National University, 1972, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in response to an Uyghur request, this was changed to ''Huíhú'' (回鶻) in 788 or 809.  Chinese history ''[[Old History of the Five Dynasties|Jiu Wudai Shi]]'' interprets the term ''Huíhú'' literally as the "rapidity with which they turned around and swooped down like a falcon".&lt;ref name="golden" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E8%88%8A%E4%BA%94%E4%BB%A3%E5%8F%B2/%E5%8D%B7138 舊五代史] Jiu Wudai Shi, Chapter 138. Original text: 回鶻，其先匈奴之種也。後魏時，號爲鐵勒，亦名回紇。唐元和四年，本國可汗遣使上言，改爲回鶻，義取迴旋搏擊，如鶻之迅捷也。  Translation: Hui Hu [Uyghur], originally of Xiongnu stock. During Later Wei, they were called ''Tiele''. They were also called ''Hui He''.  In the fourth year of the [[Emperor Xianzong of Tang|Yuanhe]] era, the Khan of their country sent an envoy to submit a request, and the name was changed to ''Hui Hu''.  It takes its meaning from turning round to strike rapidly like a falcon.&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern etymological explanations have ranged from "to follow, accommodate oneself" and "non-rebellious" (from Turk. uy/uð-) to "to wake, rouse, stir" (from oðğur-), none of which is thought satisfactory because the sound shift ð/ḏ &gt; y did not appear to have taken place by this time.&lt;ref name="golden" /&gt;  The etymology therefore cannot be accurately determined, and historically the groups it denoted were not ethnically fixed, since it denoted a political rather than a tribal identity,&lt;ref&gt;Hakan Özoğlu, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; or was used originally to refer to just one group among several, the others calling themselves ''[[Toquz Oghuz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lilla Russell-Smith, ''Uygur patronage in Dunhuang: regional art centres on the northern Silk Road in the tenth and eleventh centuries.'' Brill, 2005, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest record of an Uyghur tribe is from the [[Northern Wei Dynasty]] (386-534). At that time the ethnonym ''Gaoche'' (in Uyghur: ''Qangqil'', قاڭقىل) ({{zh|c=高車|p=Gāochē|l=high carts|links=no}}) was used, and later, ''[[Tiele people|Tiele]]'' ({{zh|c=鐵勒|p=Tiělè|links=no}}; Turkic: Tele).&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; The first use of ''Uyghur'' as a reference to a political nation occurred during the interim period between the First and Second [[Göktürk]] Khaganates (630-684).&lt;ref name="Güzel 2002"&gt;{{Cite book |last= Güzel |first= Hasan Celal |last2= Oğuz |first2= C.

The term ''Uyghur'' disappeared from historical records in the 15th century, but the [[Bolsheviks]] reintroduced the term ''Uyghur'' to replace the previously used [[Turkic peoples|Turk]] or [[Turki]].&lt;ref&gt;The term ''Turk'' was a generic label used by members of many ethnic groups in Soviet Central Asia. Often the deciding factor for classifying individuals belonging to Turkic nationalities in the Soviet censuses was less what the people called themselves by nationality than what language they claimed as their native tongue. Thus, people who called themselves "Turk" but spoke Uzbek were classified in Soviet censuses as Uzbek by nationality. See Brian D. Silver, "The Ethnic and Language Dimensions in Russian and Soviet Censuses", in Ralph S. Clem, ed., ''Research Guide to the Russian and Soviet Censuses'' (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1986): 70-97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, S. Robert (1987). ''The Languages of China''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, pp. 185–6.&lt;/ref&gt;  In modern usage, Uyghur refers to settled Turkic urban dwellers and farmers of [[Kashgaria]] or [[Uyghurstan]] who follow traditional Central Asian sedentary practices, as distinguished from nomadic Turkic populations in Central Asia.

Throughout its history, the term ''Uyghur'' has taken on an increasingly expansive definition.  Initially signifying only a small coalition of [[Tiele people|Tiele]] tribes in Northern China, Mongolia, and the [[Altay Mountains]], it later denoted citizenship in the [[Uyghur Khaganate]]. Finally it was expanded into an ethnicity whose ancestry originates with the fall of the Uyghur Khaganate in the year 842, which caused Uyghur migration from [[Mongolia]] into the Tarim Basin. This migration assimilated and replaced the [[Indo-European]]s of the region to create a distinct identity, as the language and culture of the Turkic migrants eventually supplanted the original Indo-European influences. This fluid definition of ''Uyghur'' and the diverse ancestry of modern Uyghurs create confusion about what constitutes true Uyghur [[ethnography]] and [[ethnogenesis]].

Contemporary scholars consider modern Uyghurs to be the descendants of a number of people, including the ancient Uyghurs of Mongolia who arrived at the Tarim Basin after the fall of Uyghur Khaganate, Iranian [[Saka]] tribes, and other Indo-European peoples who inhabited the Tarim Basin before the arrival of the Mongolian Uyghurs.&lt;ref name="xinjiang"&gt;{{cite book |author=James A.

===Origin of the modern ethnic concept===
&lt;blockquote&gt;""The Uighurs are the people whom old Russian travellers called Sart (a name which they used for sedentary, Turkish-speaking Central Asians in general), while Western travellers called them Turki, in recognition of their language. The Chinese used to call them Ch'an-t'ou ('Turbaned Heads') but this term has been dropped, being considered derogatory, and the Chinese, using their own pronunciation, now called them Weiwuerh. As a matter of fact there was for centuries no 'national' name for them; people identified themselves with the oasis they came from, like Kashgar or Turfan."" &amp;mdash; Owen Lattimore, "Return to China's Northern Frontier." ''The Geographical Journal'',  Vol. 139, No. 2, June 1973&lt;ref&gt;Lattimore (1973), p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term "Uyghur" was not used to refer to any existing ethnic group in the 19th century, but to an ancient people. A late 19th-century encyclopedia titled ''The cyclopædia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia'' said "the Uigur are the most ancient of Turkish tribes, and formerly inhabited a part of Chinese Tartary (Xinjiang), which is now occupied by a mixed population of Turk, Mongol, and [[Kalmuck]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://archive.org/stream/cyclopdiaindiaa02balfgoog#page/n922/mode/2up |title=The cyclopædia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia: commercial, industrial and scientific, products of the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms, useful arts and manufactures|author=Edward Balfour|authorlink=Edward Balfour|year=1885|publisher=[[B.

Rian Thum explored the concepts of identity among the ancestors of the modern Uyghurs in [[Altishahr]] (the native Uyghur name for eastern Turkestan or southern Xinjiang) before the adoption of the name "Uyghur" in the 1930s, referring to them by the name "Altishahri" in her article ''Modular History: Identity Maintenance before Uyghur Nationalism''. Thum indicated that Altishahri Turkis did have a sense that they were a distinctive group separate from the Turkic Andijanis to their west, the nomadic Turkic Kirghiz, the nomadic Mongol Qalmaq, and the Han Chinese Khitay before they became known as Uyghurs. There was no single name used by them to refer to themselves, the various native names Altishahris used to refer to themselves were Altishahrlik (Altishahr person), yerlik (local), Turki, and Musulmān (Muslim), the term Musulmān in this stituation did not signify religious connotations, because the Altishahris would exclude other Muslim peoples like the Kirghiz when referring to themselves as Musulmān.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thum |first=Rian |last2= |first2= |date=6 August 2012 |title= Modular History: Identity Maintenance before Uyghur Nationalism |url= http://www.academia.edu/1558522/Modular_History_Identity_Maintenance_before_Uyghur_Nationalism |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |publisher= The Association for Asian Studies, Inc. 2012 |volume=  71 |issue= 03pages=627-653 |doi= 10.1017/S0021911812000629 |accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Laura J Newby has also noted that the sedentary Altishahri Turkic people felt themselves as a separate group from other Turkic Muslims since at least the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Empire And the Khanate: A Political History of Qing Relations With Khoqand C.1760-1860|first=L.

[[Pan-Turkism|Pan-Turkic]] [[Jadidism|Jadidists]] and [[East Turkestan Independence Movement|East Turkestan Independence activists]] [[Muhammad Amin Bughra]] (Mehmet Emin) and [[Masud Sabri]] rejected the Soviet imposition of the name "Uyghur" upon the Turkic people of Xinjiang. They wanted instead the name "Turkic ethnicity" (Tujue zu in Chinese) to be applied to their people. Masud Sabri also viewed the [[Hui people]] as Muslim Han Chinese and separate from his own people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=qz3vdkxBt4AC&amp;pg=PA181#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false] {{harvnb|Wei|2002|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names "Türk" or "Türki" in particular were demanded by Bughra as the real name for his people. He criticized Sheng Shicai for his designation of Turkic Muslims into different ethnicities which could sow disunion among Turkic Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA209#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false] {{harvnb|Millward|2007|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In current usage, ''Uyghur'' refers to settled Turkic urban dwellers and farmers of the [[Tarim Basin]] and [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture|Ili]] who follow traditional Central Asian sedentary practices, as distinguished from nomadic Turkic populations in [[Central Asia]]. However, the Chinese government has also designated as "Uyghur" certain peoples with significantly divergent histories and ancestries from the main group. These include the [[Loplik people]] and the [[Dolan people]], who are thought to be closer to the [[Oirats|Oirat Mongols]] and the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]].&lt;ref name="Dis"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dislocating China: Reflections on Muslims, Minorities, and Other Subaltern Subjects|first=Dru|last=Gladney|publisher=C.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Uyghur people}}

The history of the Uyghur people, as with the ethnic origin of the people, is a matter of contention between Uyghur nationalists and the Chinese authority.&lt;ref name="bovingdon"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Uyghurs - strangers in their own land |author=Gardner Bovingdon |chapter=Chapter 1 - Using the Past to Serve the Present |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-231-14758-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Uyghur historians viewed the Uyghurs as the original inhabitants of Xinjiang with a long history.  Uyghur politician and historian [[Muhammad Amin Bughra|Muhemmed Imin Bughra]] wrote in his book ''A history of East Turkestan'', stressing the Turkic aspects of his people, that the Turks have a 9000-year history, while historian [[Turgun Almas]] incorporated discoveries of Tarim mummies to conclude that Uyghurs have over 6400 years of history,&lt;ref name="Tursun"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?ots591=0c54e3b3-1e9c-be1e-2c24-a6a8c7060233&amp;lng=en&amp;id=105630 |title= The Formation of Modern Uyghur Historiography and Competing Perspectives toward Uyghur History |author= Nabijan Tursun |journal=The China and Eurasia Forum Quarterly |volume= 6 |issue= 3 |pages=87–100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Uyghur Congress]] claimed a 4,000-year history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.uyghurcongress.org/en/?cat=132 |title=Brief History of East Turkestan |work=World Uyghur Congress }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, official Chinese view asserts that the Uyghurs in Xinjiang originated from the Tiele tribes and only became the main social and political force in Xinjiang during the ninth century when they migrated to Xinjiang from Mongolia after the collapse of the Uyghur Khaganate, replacing the Han Chinese they claimed were there since the Han Dynasty.&lt;ref name="Tursun" /&gt;  Many contemporary Western scholars, however, do not consider the modern Uyghurs to be of direct linear descent from the old Uyghur Khaganate of Mongolia. Rather, they consider them to be descendants of a number of people, one of them the ancient Uyghurs.&lt;ref name="xinjiang"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fgHlxD4k0z4C&amp;pg=PA135&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Democratization and Identity: Regimes and Ethnicity in East and Southeast Asia|author=Susan J.

Professor James A. Millward described the original Uyghurs as physically [[Mongoloid]], giving as an example the images in [[Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves|Bezeklik]] at temple 9 of the Uyghur patrons, until they began to mix with the Tarim Basin's original eastern Iranian inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eurasian Crossroads: A History of Xinjiang|first=James A.|last=Millward|volume=|edition=illustrated|year=2007|publisher=Columbia University Press|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=43|isbn=0231139241|accessdate=10 March 2014| ref = {{harvid||}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
According to western scholars, the discovery of well-preserved [[Tarim mummies]] of a people Caucasian in appearance may indicates the migration of an Indo-European people into the Tarim area at the beginning of the [[Bronze age]] around 2,000 BCE.  These people probably spoke [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]], and were suggested by some to be the [[Yuezhi]] mentioned in ancient Chinese text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Millward, James A. |year=2007 |title= Eurasian Crossroads: A History of Xinjiang |publisher= Columbia University Press, New York |page=14|isbn= 978-0-231-13924-3 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia |author=A. K Narain |chapter= Chapter 6 - Indo-Europeans in Inner Asia |editor = Denis Sinor |page=153 |isbn=978-0-521-24304-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Uyghur activists claimed these mummies to be of Uyghur origin, based partly on a word, which they argued to be Uyghur, found in written scripts associated with these mummies, although other linguists suggest it to be a [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] word later absorbed into Uyghur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Xinjiang, China's Muslim Borderland |chapter=Chapter 14 - Contested histories |author=Gardner Bovingdon |editor=S. Frederick Starr |pages=357–358 |isbn=978-0-7656-1318-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later migrations brought peoples from the west and northwest to the Xinjiang region, probably speakers of various Iranian languages such as the [[Saka]] tribes.  Other people in the region mentioned in ancient Chinese texts include the [[Dingling]] as well as the [[Xiongnu]] who fought for supremacy in the region against the Chinese for several hundred years.  The Dingling is seen by early Chinese history books to be the ancestors of the ancient Uyghurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Barbara A.

The Yuezhi were driven away by the Xiongnu, but founded the [[Kushan Empire]] which exerted some influence in the Tarim Basin where [[Kharoshti]] scripts used by the Kushan Empire have been found in [[Loulan Kingdom|Loulan]], [[Niya (Tarim Basin)|Niya]] and [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotan]].  Loulan and Khotan were some of the many city states that existed in the Xinjiang region during the Han Dynasty, others include [[Kucha]], [[Turfan]], [[Karashahr]] and [[Kashgar]].  The settled population of these cities later merged with incoming Turkic people such as the Uyghurs of Uyghur Khaganate to form the modern Uyghurs.

===Uyghur Khaganate===
The Uyghurs of the Uyghur Khaganate were part of a Turkic confederation called the [[Tiele people|Tiele]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to the History of the Turkic Peoples: Ethnogenesis and State-Formation in Medieval and Early Modern Eurasia and the Middle East |author=Peter B.

They overthrew the [[Göktürk Khaganate]] and established the Uyghur Khaganate.

The [[Uyghur Khaganate]] stretched from the [[Caspian Sea]] to [[Manchuria]] and lasted from 745 to 840.&lt;ref name="Güzel 2002"/&gt; It was administered from the imperial capital [[Ordu-Baliq]], one of the biggest ancient cities built in Mongolia. In 840, following a famine and civil war, the Uyghur Khaganate was overrun by the [[Yenisei Kirghiz|Kirghiz]], another Turkic people. As a result, the majority of tribal groups formerly under Uyghur control dispersed and moved out of Mongolia.

[[File:Dunhuang Uighur king.jpg|thumb|Uyghur king from Turfan region attended by servants. [[Mogao caves|Mogao cave]] 409, 11th-13th century.]]

===Uyghur kingdoms===
According to [[Tang Dynasty]] history [[Xin Tangshu]], the ancient Uyghurs who founded the Uyghur Khaganate dispersed after the fall of the Khaganate; some went to live amongst the Karluks, and some moved to [[Turpan]] and [[Gansu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E6%96%B0%E5%94%90%E6%9B%B8/%E5%8D%B7217%E4%B8%8B Xin Tangshu] Original text: 俄而渠長句錄莫賀與黠戛斯合騎十萬攻回鶻城，殺可汗，誅掘羅勿，焚其牙，諸部潰其相馺職與厖特勒十五部奔葛邏祿，殘眾入吐蕃、安西。 Translation: Soon the great chief Julumohe and the Kirghiz gathered a hundred thousand riders to attack the Uyghur city; they killed the Kaghan, executed Jueluowu, and burnt the royal camp. All the tribes were scattered - its ministers Sazhi and Pang Tele with fifteen clans fled to the Karluks, the remaining multitude went to [[Turfan]] and [[Guazhou County|Anxi]].&lt;/ref&gt;  These Uyghurs soon founded two kingdoms, the easternmost state was the Ganzhou Kingdom (870–1036), with its capital near present-day [[Zhangye]] in the [[Gansu]] province of China. The modern [[Yugur people]] are believed to be descendants of the Old Uyghur people.  The kingdom was absorbed by the [[Tanguts]] in 1036..

The second Uyghur kingdom, the [[Kingdom of Qocho]] (also known as Uyghuristan in its later period), was founded in the Turpan area with its capital in [[Gaochang]] (Qocho) and [[Beshbalik]].  The Qocho Kingdom lasted from the ninth to the fourteenth century, and proved to be longer-lasting than any power in the region, before or since.&lt;ref name="xinjiang"/&gt; The Uyghurs were originally [[Manichaean]], but converted to Buddhism in Qocho.  The Qocho Kingdom accepted the [[Kara-Khitans]] as the overlord in 1130s, and in 1209 submitted voluntarily to the rising [[Mongol Empire]]. The Uyghurs of Kingdom of Qocho were allowed significant autonomy and played an important role as civil servants to the Mongol Empire, but was finally destroyed by the [[Chagatai Khanate|Chaghataid Mongols]] in the 1390s.

===Islamization===

In the tenth century, the [[Karluks]], [[Yagma|Yaghmas]], [[Chigils]] and other Turkic tribes founded the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]] in [[Semirechye]], Western [[Tian Shan]], and [[Kashgaria]], and later conquered [[Transoxiana]]. The Karakhanid rulers were likely to be Yaghmas who were associated with the [[Toquz Oghuz]], and some historians therefore see this as a link between the Karakhanid and the Uyghurs of the Uyghur Khaganate, although this connection is disputed by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Millward, James A. |year=2007 |title= Eurasian Crossroads: A History of Xinjiang |publisher= Columbia University Press, New York |pages=52–53 |isbn= 978-0-231-13924-3 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Karakhanids converted to Islam in the tenth century, the first Turkic dynasty to do so, and modern Uyghurs see the Muslim Karakhanids as an important part of their history.  However, Islamization of the people of the Tarim Basin was a gradual process. The Buddhist [[Kingdom of Khotan]] was conquered by the Muslim Karakhanids from Kashgar in the early 11th century, but Qocho remained mainly Buddhist until the 15th century, and the conversion of the Uyghur people to Islam was not completed until the 17th century.

[[File:Chagatai Khanate (1490).png|thumb|[[Chagatai Khanate]] ([[Moghulistan]]) in 1490]]
The 12th and 13th century saw the domination by non-Muslim powers: first the [[Kara-Khitans]] in the 12th century, followed by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] in the 13th century.  After the death of [[Genghis Khan]] in 1227, Transoxiana and Kashgar became the domain of his second son, [[Chagatai Khan]].  The [[Chagatai Khanate]] split into two in the 1340s, and the area of the Chagatai Khanate where the modern Uyghurs live became part of [[Moghulistan]], which meant "land of the Mongols".  In the 14th century, a Chagatayid khan [[Tughlugh Timur|Tughluq Temür]] converted to Islam. His son [[Khizr Khoja]] conquered Qocho and Turfan (the core of Uyghuristan) in the 1390s, and the Uyghurs there became largely Muslim by the beginning of the 16th century.

From the late 14th through 17th centuries the Xinjiang region became further subdivided into Moghulistan in the north, [[Altishahr]] (Kashgar and the Tarim Basin), and the Turfan area, each often ruled separately by competing Chagatayid descendants, the [[Dughlats]], and later the [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khojas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Millward, James A. |year=2007 |title= Eurasian Crossroads: A History of Xinjiang |publisher= Columbia University Press, New York |pages=67–70, 79 |isbn= 978-0-231-13924-3 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam was also spread by the [[Sufis]], and branches of its [[Naqshbandi]] order were the [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khojas]] who seized control of political and military affairs in the Tarim Basin and Turfan in the 17th century.  The Khojas however split into two rival factions, the Aqtaghlik Khojas (also called the Afaqiyya) and the Qarataghlik Khojas (the Ishaqiyya). The legacy of the Khojas lasted until the 19th century. The Qarataghlik Khojas seized power in Yarkand where the Chagatai Khans ruled in the Yarkent Khanate, forcing the Aqtaghlik Afaqi Khoja into exile.

===Qing rule===
In the 17th century, the Buddhist [[Oirats|Oirat]] Mongol [[Dzungar Khanate]] grew in power in [[Dzungaria]] and conquered the last independent Chagatai Khanate, the [[Yarkent Khanate]] of Altishahr in the [[Dzungar conquest of Altishahr]] after the Aqtaghlik Afaq Khoja went to Lhasa in Tibet and asked the [[5th Dalai Lama]] and the Dzungars to help him in his struggle against the Qarataghlik Khojas. The Khojas in the Tarim Basin then became vassals to the [[Dzungar people|Dzungars]], who extracted heavy taxes and tribute from the Tarim Basin cities. The expansion of the Dzungars into Khalkha territory in Outer Mongolia brought them into direct conflict with the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] in the late 17th century, and in the process also brought Chinese presence back into the region a thousand years after the Tang Dynasty lost control of the [[Western Regions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= |title=Wild West China: The Taming of Xinjiang |author=Christian Tyler|page=55 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year= 2004 |isbn=978-0813535333 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qing's [[Dzungar–Qing War]] and the [[Ten Great Campaigns|final campaign against the Dzungars in the 1750s]] ended with the [[Dzungar genocide|genocide of the Dzungars]]. During the Dzungar conflict, two Aqtaghlik brothers, the so-called Younger Khoja {{ill|zh|Hojijan|霍集占}} (also known as Khwāja-i Jahān) and his sibling, the Elder Khoja, {{ill|zh|Buranidun|波羅尼都}} (also known as Burhān al-Dīn) [[Revolt of the Altishahr Khojas|rebelled against the Qing]], an action which prompted the invasion and conquest of the Tarim Basin by the Qing in 1759.  The Uyghurs from Turfan and Hami (Kumul) such as [[Emin Khoja]] were allies of the Qing in this conflict, and these Uyghurs also helped the Qing to rule the Altishahr Uyghurs in the Tarim Basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Millward, James A. |year=2007 |title= Eurasian Crossroads: A History of Xinjiang |publisher= Columbia University Press, New York |page=101 |isbn= 978-0-231-13924-3 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3107653|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3107653?seq=10|title=The Begs of Xinjiang: Between Two Worlds|last=Newby|first=L.

During the [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)|Dungan revolt]] of 1864, Andijani Uzbeks from the [[Kokand Khanate]] under [[Buzurg Khan]] and [[Yakub Beg]] expelled Qing Dynasty officials from parts of southern Xinjiang and founded an independent [[Kashgaria]] kingdom, called ''Yettishar'' (English: "country of seven cities"). Under the leadership of [[Yakub Beg]], it included [[Kashgar]], [[Yarkent County|Yarkand]], [[Hotan]], [[Aksu, Xinjiang|Aksu]], [[Kucha]], [[Korla]], and [[Turpan]].

Large Qing dynasty forces under Chinese General [[Zuo Zongtang]] attacked [[Kashgaria]] in 1876.

===Modern era===
In 1912, the Qing Dynasty was replaced by the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]]. By 1920, Pan-Turkic [[Jadidist]] Islamists had become a challenge to Chinese warlord [[Yang Zengxin]] (楊增新) who controlled Xinjiang. Uyghurs staged several uprisings against Chinese rule. Twice, in 1933 and 1944, the Uyghurs successfully gained their independence (backed by the Soviet Communist leader [[Joseph Stalin]]): the [[First East Turkestan Republic]] was a short-lived attempt at independence around [[Kashgar Prefecture|Kashghar]], and it was destroyed during the [[Kumul Rebellion]] by [[Hui people|Chinese Muslim]] army under General [[Ma Zhancang]] and [[Ma Fuyuan]] at the [[Battle of Kashgar (1934)]]. The [[Second East Turkestan Republic]] was a Soviet puppet Communist state that existed from 1944 to 1949 in what is now [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture]] after the [[Ili Rebellion]].

[[File:Xinjiang nationalities by prefecture 2000.png|thumb|Map of population of [[Xinjiang]] according to the Chinese source of 2001, the prefectures with Uyghur majority are in blue.]]
Mao declared the founding of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] on October 1, 1949.
He turned the Second East Turkistan Republic into the [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture]], and appointed [[Saifuddin Azizi]] as the region's first Communist Party governor. Many Republican loyalists fled into exile in Turkey and Western countries. The name Xinjiang was changed to Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, where Uyghurs are the largest ethnic group, mostly concentrated in the southwestern Xinjiang.&lt;ref&gt;2000年人口普查中国民族人口资料，民族出版社，2003/9 (ISBN 7-105-05425-5)&lt;/ref&gt; (see map, right)

Uyghur identity remains fragmented, as some support a [[Pan-Islamism|Pan-Islamic]] vision, exemplified by the [[East Turkestan Islamic Movement]], while others support a [[Pan-Turkism|Pan-Turkic]] vision, such as the [[East Turkestan Liberation Organization]]. A third group would like a "Uyghur[[-stan|stan]]" state, such as the [[East Turkestan independence movement]]. As a result, "[n]o Uyghur or East Turkestan group speaks for all Uyghurs, although it might claim to", and Uyghurs in each of these camps have committed violence against other Uyghurs who they think are too assimilated to Chinese or Russian society or are not religious enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Constituting the Uyghur in U.S.-China Relations: The Geopolitics of Identity Formation in the War on Terrorism|first=Gaye|last=Christofferson|journal=[[Strategic Insights]]|publisher=Center for Contemporary Conflict|date=September 2002|volume=1|issue=7|url=http://www.nps.edu/Academics/centers/ccc/publications/OnlineJournal/2002/sept02/eastAsia.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindful not to take sides, Uyghur leaders such as [[Rebiya Kadeer]] mainly try to garner international support for the "rights and interests of the Uyghurs", including the right to demonstrate, although the Chinese government has accused her of orchestrating the deadly [[July 2009 Ürümqi riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90002/96417/6695082.html|title=Unveiled Rebiya Kadeer: a Uighur Dalai Lama|date=2009-07-07|accessdate=2010-08-21|publisher=[[People's Daily]]|first=Li|last=Hongmei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to eating pork, the Uyghurs of [[Changde]] Hunan practice other Han Chinese customs, like ancestor worship at graves. Some Uyghurs from Xinjiang visit the Hunan Uyghurs out of curiosity or interest.&lt;ref name="Shih" /&gt; Also, the Uyghurs of Hunan do not speak the [[Uyghur language]], instead, they speak Chinese as their native language, and Arabic for religious reasons at the mosque.&lt;ref name="Shih" /&gt;

==Genetics==
The Uyghurs are a [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)]] population with Eastern and Western Eurasian anthropometric and genetic traits. Uyghurs are thus one of the many populations of Central Eurasia that can be considered to be genetically related to European and East Asian populations.  However, various scientific studies differ on the size of each component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khazaria.com/genetics/uygurs.html |title=Uygur Genetics - DNA of Turkic people from Xinjiang, China |publisher=Khazaria.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study, using samples from Hetian ([[Hotan]]) only, found that Uyghurs have 60% European ancestry and 40% East Asian ancestry.&lt;ref name="ajhg"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shuhua Xu, Wei Huang, Ji Qian, and Li Jin  | title = Analysis of Genomic Admixture in Uyghur and Its Implication in Mapping Strategy |journal=Am J Hum Genet. | date=April 11, 2008 | volume =  82 | issue = 4| pages =  883–89 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.01.017  |pmc=2427216 | pmid=18355773}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A further study showed slightly greater European component (52% European) in the Uyghur population in southern Xinjiang, but slightly greater East Asian component (47% European) in the northern Uyghur population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shuhua Xu and Li Jin  | title = A Genome-wide Analysis of Admixture in Uyghurs and a High-Density Admixture Map for Disease-Gene Discovery|journal=Am J Hum Genet. | date=September 2008 | volume =  83 | issue = 3 | pages =  322–36 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.08.001 |pmc=2556439 | pmid=18760393 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study used a larger sample of individuals from a wider area, and found only about 30% European component to the admixture.&lt;ref name="cite journal|pmc=2790568"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2790568|title=Genetic Landscape of Eurasia and "Admixture" in Uyghurs|year=2009|volume=85|issue=6|pmid=20004770|last1=Li|first1=H|last2=Cho|first2=K|last3=Kidd|first3=JR|last4=Kidd|first4=KK|pages=934–7; author reply 937–9|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.10.024|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study on [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup|mitochondrial DNA]] (therefore the matrilineal genetic contribution) found the frequency of western Eurasian-specific haplogroup in Uyghurs to be 42.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yao YG, Kong QP, Wang CY, Zhu CL, Zhang YP.  | title = Different matrilineal contributions to genetic structure of ethnic groups in the silk road region in China |journal=Mol Biol Evol. |date=Dec 2004 | volume =  21 | issue = 12 | pages = 2265–80 |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/12/2265.long | pmid=15317881 | doi=10.1093/molbev/msh238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The admixture may be the result of a continuous gene flow from populations of European and Asian descent, or may have been formed by a single event of admixture during a short period of time (the hybrid isolation model). If a hybrid isolation model is assumed, it can be estimated that the hypothetical admixture event occurred about 126 generations ago, or 2,520 years ago assuming 20 years per generation.&lt;ref name="ajhg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2008/03/uyghurs-are-hybrids/ |title=Uyghurs are hybrids &amp;#124; Gene Expression &amp;#124; Discover Magazine |publisher=Blogs.discovermagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the paper by Li ''et al.'':

{{Quotation|... the western East Asians are more closely related to Uyghurs than the eastern East Asians. ... STRUCTURE cannot distinguish recent admixture from a cline of other origin, and these analyses cannot prove admixture in the Uyghurs; however, historical records indicate that the present Uyghurs were formed by admixture between [[Tocharians]] from the west and Orkhon Uyghurs (Wugusi-Huihu, according to present Chinese pronunciation) from the east in the 8th century CE. The Uyghur Empire was originally located in Mongolia and conquered the Tocharian tribes in Xinjiang. Tocharians such as [[Kroran]] have been shown by archaeological findings to appear phenotypically similar to northern Europeans, whereas the Orkhon Uyghur people were clearly Mongolians. The two groups of people subsequently mixed in Xinjiang to become one population, the present Uyghurs. We do not know the genetic constitution of the Tocharians, but if they were similar to western Siberians, such as the Khanty, admixture would already be biased toward similarity with East Asian populations.|&lt;ref name="cite journal|pmc=2790568"/&gt;}}

The paper further concludes:
{{Quotation|... that the Uyghurs' genetic structure is more similar to East Asians than to Europeans, in contrast to the reports by Xu and Jin, whose work may have been affected by their sparse population coverage. The median line of the Eurasian genetic landscape appears to lie to the west of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. When we have collected more data on these 34 populations, we should be able to refine these estimates.|&lt;ref name="cite journal|pmc=2790568"/&gt;}}

It is closely related to [[Äynu language|Äynu]], [[Lop language|Lop]], [[Ili Turki language|Ili Turki]], and [[Chagatay language|Chagatay]] (the East Karluk languages), and slightly less closely to [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] (which is West Karluk).

The Uyghur language is an [[agglutinative language]] and has a [[subject-object-verb]] word order.  It has [[vowel harmony]] like other Turkic languages, and has noun and verb [[Grammatical case|cases]], but lacks distinction of gender forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~celcar/pamphlets/Uyghur.pdf |title=Uyghur |work=Center for Languages of the Central Asian Region |publisher=Indiana University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Uyghurs have adopted a number of scripts for their language. The [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic script]], known as the [[Chagatay alphabet]], was adopted along with Islam.  Political changes in the 20th century led to numerous reforms of the writing scripts, for example the [[Cyrillic]]-based [[Uyghur Cyrillic alphabet]], a Latin [[Uyghur New Script]], and later a reformed [[Uyghur Arabic alphabet]]. A new Latin version, the [[Uyghur Latin alphabet]], was also devised in the 21st century.

===Literature===
Most of the early Uyghur literary works were translations of Buddhist and Manichaean religious texts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hk.plm.org.cn/e_book/xz-11348.pdf 西域、 敦煌文献所见回鹊之佛经翻译]{{dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there were also narrative, poetic, and epic works apparently original to the Uyghurs.  The literary works from the Kara-Khanid period are considered by modern Uyghurs to be an important part of their literary traditions.  Amongst these are Islamic religious texts and histories of Turkic peoples, and important works surviving from that era are [[Qutatqu Bilik]] (Wisdom Of Royal Glory) by [[Yusuf Balasaghuni|Yüsüp Has Hajip]] (1069–70), [[Kashgarli Mehmud|Mähmut Qäşqäri]]'s ''Divan-i Lugat-it Türk''- A Dictionary of Turkic Dialects (1072), and Ähmät Yüknäki's ''Atabetul Hakayik''. Perhaps the most famous and best loved pieces of modern Uyghur literature are [[Abdurehim Otkur]]'s ''Iz'', ''Oyghanghan Zimin'', [[Zordun Sabir]]'s ''Anayurt'' and [[Ziya Samedi]]'s (former minister of culture in Sinkiang Government in 50's) novels ''Mayimkhan'' and ''Mystery of the years''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===Music===
{{listen|filename=Chirayliq.ogg|title=Uyghur Pop|description=An example of modern Uyghur music}}

[[Muqam]] is the classical musical style. The '''12 Muqams''' are the national oral epic of the Uyghurs. The muqam system developed among the Uyghur in northwest [[China]] and [[Central Asia]] over approximately the last 1500 years from the Arabic [[maqama]]t modal system that has led to many musical genres among peoples of [[Eurasia]] and [[North Africa]]. Uyghurs have local muqam systems named after the oasis towns of [[Xinjiang]], such as [[Dolan people|Dolan]], [[Ghulja|Ili]], [[Kumul (city)|Kumul]] and [[Turpan]]. The most fully developed at this point is the Western [[Tarim Basin|Tarim]] region's 12 muqams, which are now a large canon of music and songs recorded from the traditional performers [[Turdi Akhun]] and [[Omar Akhun]] among others in the 1950s and edited into a more systematic system. Although the folk performers probably improvised their songs as in Turkish [[Taqsim|taksim]] performances, the present institutional canon is performed as fixed compositions by ensembles.

The Uyghur Muqam of Xinjiang has been designated by UNESCO as part of the Intangible Heritage of Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?RL=21 |title=UNESCO Culture Sector - Intangible Heritage - 2003 Convention : |publisher=Unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amannisa Khan]], sometimes called Amanni Shahan, (1526–1560) is credited with collecting and thereby preserving the Twelve Muqam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kashi.gov.cn/English/Tourism/Customs/12muqams.htm |title=Kashgar Welcome You! |publisher=Kashi.gov.cn |date= |accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian scholar Pantusov writes that the Uyghurs manufactured their own musical instruments; they had 62 different kinds of musical instruments and in every Uyghur home there used to be an instrument called a "[[dutar]]".

===Dance===
[[Sanam (dance)|Sanam]] is a popular folk dance among the Uyghur people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Imagined Differences: Hatred and the Construction of Identity|editor1-first=Günther|editor1-last=Schlee|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|year=2002|chapter=Temperamental Neighbours: Uighur-Han Relations in Xinjiang, Northwest China|last=Bellér-Hann|first=Ildikó|page=66|quote=The fact that many young girls hope to pursue careers as folk dancers is perhaps another indication that the stereotype promoted by the Chinese authorities of the colourful, exotic minorities who dance and sing is not a pure Chinese invention: the Uighur themselves regard this as an important expression of their identity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is commonly danced by people at weddings, festive occasions, and parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~mehmud/uyghur/music_dance.html |title=Uyghur Music |author=Mehmud Abliz }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dance may be performed with singing and musical accompaniment.  Sama is a form of group dance for [[Newruz]] (New Year).  Some dances may be alternate between singing and dancing, and Uyghur hand-drums called ''dap'' may be used as accompaniment to the dance.

===Art===
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, scientific and archaeological expeditions to the region of Xinjiang's [[Silk Road]] discovered numerous cave temples, monastery ruins, and wall paintings, as well as miniatures, books, and documents. There are 77 [[Rock cut architecture|rock-cut]] caves at the site. Most have rectangular spaces with rounded [[arch]] [[ceiling]]s often divided into four sections, each with a [[mural]] of  [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The effect is of an entire ceiling covered with hundreds of Buddha murals. Some ceilings are painted with a large Buddha surrounded by other figures, including Indians, Persians and Europeans. The quality of the murals vary with some being artistically naive while others are masterpieces of religious art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.showcaves.com/english/cn/misc/Bezeklik.html |title= Bizaklik Thousand Buddha Caves |publisher= ''www.showcaves.com'' |accessdate= 2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Historically, In the ages of Karluk (Kara-Hanids) the education level of Uyghur people was higher than the other ethnics around them, Uyghurs was the major warfare engineers in Mongolian Empire and Uyghurs had a high status in the Mongolian empire.  Education was provided for both boy and girls in by separate schools (''[[madrassah]]'' and ''[[Maktab|maktap]]'') attached to local mosques, some of which may also offer also modern secular subjects in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = East Turkestan history|last = Muhammad emin|first = Bughra|publisher = |year = 1941|isbn = |location = Kabul|pages = 155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="benson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="education"/&gt;  However, in more recent times, religious education is highly restricted in Xinjiang, and the Chinese authority had sought to eradicate any religious school they considered illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NKCU3BdeBbEC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Situating the Uyghurs between China and Central Asia|author=Ildikó Bellér-Hann|year=2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|isbn=0-7546-7041-4|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Madrasa in Asia: Political Activism and Transnational Linkages |editors= Farish A.

Beginning in the early 20th century, secular education became more widespread, and in the [[PRC]] era, Uyghurs may have a choice from two separate secular school systems, one conducted in their own language, and one offering instructions only in Chinese, the schools with bilingual education is insufficient for the Uyghurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = English language education across greater china|last = Anwei|first = Feng|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 262}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Uyghurs link the preservation of their cultural and religious identity with the language of instruction in schools and therefore preferr Uyghur language school.&lt;ref name="benson"&gt;{{cite book |title=Xinjiang, China's Muslim Borderland |chapter=Chapter 7 - Education and Social Mobility among Minority Populations in Xinjiang |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GXj4a3gss8wC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;dq=&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=Linda Benson |editor=S.

By 2002 [[Xinjiang University]], originally a bilingual institution, had ceased offering courses in the Uyghur language.  From 2004 onward, the government policy is that classes should be conducted in Chinese as much as possible, and in some selected regions, instruction in Chinese began in the first grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Xinjiang Conflict: Uyghur Identity, Language Policy, and Political Discourse |url= http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/PS015.pdf |author=Arienne M. Dwyer |publisher=East-West Center Washington |year=2005 |pages=34–41 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The level of education attainment among Uyghurs is generally lower than that of the Han Chinese; this may be due to the  cost of education, the lack of proficiency in the Chinese language among many Uyghurs, and a poorer employment prospect for Uyghur graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://sites.miis.edu/comparativeeducation/files/2013/01/Education-Integration-and-the-Uyghurs.pdf |title=The Xinjiang Class: Education, Integration, and the Uyghurs |author=Timothy A.

===Medicine===
Today, traditional Uyghur medicine can still be found at street stands. Similar to other traditional medicine, diagnosis is usually made through checking the pulse, symptoms, and disease history, and then the pharmacist pounds up different dried herbs, making personalized medicines according to the prescription. Modern Uyghur medical hospitals adopted modern medical science and medicine and applied evidence-based pharmaceutical technology to traditional medicines. Historically Uyghur medical knowledge have contributed to Chinese medicine in terms of medical treatments, medicinal materials and ingredients, and symptom detection. It introduced to Chinese medicine the medical use of snakes, opium and many new kinds of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 中国医学百科全书：维吾尔医学|publisher = 上海科学技术出版社|date = 2005-09-01|isbn = 9787532377930|location = China|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Xinjiang cuisine}}
[[File:Uyghur polu closeup.JPG|thumb|Uyghur [[pilaf]] (پولۇ)]]
Uyghur food shows both Central Asian and Chinese elements. A typical Uyghur dish is ''polo'' (or [[pilaf]]), a dish found throughout Central Asia. In a common version of the Uyghur ''polo'', carrots and mutton (or chicken) are first fried in oil with onion, then rice and water are added, and the whole dish is steamed. Raisins and dried apricots may also be added. Also found here is ''kawaplar'' (i.e., [[kebab]]s or grilled meat). Another common Uyghur dish is ''läghmän'' (لەغمەن), a noodle dish with stir-fried topping usually made of mutton, tomatoes, onions, green peppers and other vegetables. This dish is likely to have originated from the Chinese ''[[lamian]]'', but its flavor and preparation method are distinctively Uyghur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NKCU3BdeBbEC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Situating the Uyghurs between China and Central Asia|chapter= Chapter 10, ''Polo'', ''läghmän'', ''So Säy'': Situating Uyghur Food Between Central Asia and China|author=M Critina Cesàro|year=2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|isbn=0-7546-7041-4|pages=185–202|accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uyghur food (''Uyghurche Yemekliri'') is characterized by [[mutton]], [[beef]], [[Camel#Meat|camel]] (solely [[Bactrian camel|bactrian]]), [[chicken (food)|chicken]], [[goose]], [[carrot]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[onion]]s, [[bell pepper|peppers]], [[eggplant]], [[celery]], various [[dairy product|dairy foods]], and [[fruit]]s.

An Uyghur-style breakfast is [[tea]] with home-baked [[bread]], [[hardened yogurt]], [[olive]]s, [[honey]], [[raisin]]s, and [[almond]]s. Uyghurs like to treat guests with tea, [[naan]] and fruit before the main dishes are ready.

''[[Sangza]]'' ([[Uyghur language|Uyghur]]: ساڭزا) are crispy and tasty fried [[wheat flour]] dough twists, a holiday specialty. ''[[Samosa|Samsa]]'' ([[Uyghur language|Uyghur]]: سامسا) are lamb [[pie]]s baked using a special brick oven. ''[[Youtazi]]'' is steamed multi-layer bread. ''[[Göshnan]]'' ([[Uyghur language|Uyghur]]: گۆشنان) are pan-grilled lamb pies. ''[[Pamirdin]]'' are baked pies with lamb, carrots, and onion stuffed inside. ''[[Chorba|Xurpa]]'' is lamb [[soup]] ([[Uyghur language|Uyghur]]: شۇرپا). Other dishes include ''[[Tohax]]'', a different type of baked bread, and ''[[Doner kebab|Tunurkawab]]''. Also, ''Girde'' is a very popular [[bagel]]-like bread with a hard and crispy crust that's soft inside.
