(These reflect the various Cyrillic spellings Уиғур, Уигур, and Уйгур.) The name is usually pronounced in English as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|iː|ɡ|ʊər}},&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{citation |contribution=Uighur, ''n.'' and ''adj.'' |contribution-url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/208581 |title=Oxford English Dictionary |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press }}.&lt;/ref&gt; although some Uyghurs and Uyghur scholars have advocated for using the closer pronunciation {{IPAc-en|uː|i|ˈ|g|ʊər}} instead.{{sfn|Hahn|2006|p=4}}{{sfn|Drompp|2005|p=7}}

The original meaning of the term is unclear.

None of these is thought to be satisfactory because the sound shift of /ð/ and /ḏ/ to /j/ does not appear to have taken place by this time.{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=155}} The etymology therefore cannot be conclusively determined, and its referent is also difficult to fix. The "Huihe" and "Huihu" seem to have been a political rather than a [[tribe|tribal]] designation&lt;ref&gt;Hakan Özoğlu, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; or to have just been one group among several others collectively known as the [[Toquz Oghuz]].{{sfn|Russell-Smith|2005|p= 32}} The name fell out of use in the 15th century, but it was reintroduced in the early 20th century{{sfn|Fairbank|1968|p=364}}{{sfn|Özoğlu|2004|p=16}} by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Bolsheviks]] to replace the previous terms "[[Turkic peoples|Turk]]" and "[[Turki]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Ramsey |first=S.

Often the deciding factor for classifying individuals belonging to Turkic nationalities in the Soviet censuses was less what the people called themselves by nationality than what language they claimed as their native tongue. Thus, people who called themselves "Turk" but spoke Uzbek were classified in Soviet censuses as Uzbek by nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Brian D. |last=Silver |contribution=The Ethnic and Language Dimensions in Russian and Soviet Censuses |editor=Ralph S.

The Uyghurs also appear in Chinese records under other names. The earliest record to a Uyghur tribe appears in accounts from the [[Northern Wei]] (4th–6th century A.D.). They are described as the {{lang|zh|{{linktext|高車}} / {{linktext|高车}}}} (&lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "High Carts"), now read as ''Gāochē'' but with the reconstructed Middle Chinese pronunciation *[kɑutɕʰĭa]. This in turn has been connected to the [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] ''Qangqil'' ({{lang|ug|قاڭقىل}} or Қаңқил). They were later known as the ''[[Tiele people|Tiele]]'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|鐵勒}} / {{linktext|铁勒}}}}, ''Tiělè'').{{sfn|Mair|2006|pp=137–8}}

Throughout its history, the term ''Uyghur'' has taken on an increasingly expansive definition.  Initially signifying only a small coalition of [[Tiele people|Tiele]] tribes in Northern China, Mongolia, and the [[Altai Mountains]], it later denoted citizenship in the [[Uyghur Khaganate]]. Finally, it was expanded into an ethnicity whose ancestry originates with the fall of the Uyghur Khaganate in the year 842, which caused Uyghur migration from [[Mongolia]] into the Tarim Basin. This migration assimilated and replaced the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European speakers]] of the region to create a distinct identity as the language and culture of the Turkic migrants eventually supplanted the original Indo-European influences. This fluid definition of ''Uyghur'' and the diverse ancestry of modern Uyghurs create confusion about what constitutes true Uyghur [[ethnography]] and [[ethnogenesis]].

Contemporary scholars consider modern Uyghurs to be the descendants of a number of people, including the ancient Uyghurs of Mongolia who arrived at the Tarim Basin after the fall of the Uyghur Khaganate, Iranic [[Saka]] tribes, and other Indo-European peoples who inhabited the Tarim Basin before the arrival of the Turkic Uyghurs.&lt;ref name="xinjiang"&gt;{{cite book |author1=James A.

===Origin of the modern ethnic concept===
{{quote|The Uighurs are the people whom old Russian travellers called [[Sart]] (a name which they used for sedentary, Turkish-speaking Central Asians in general), while Western travellers called them Turki, in recognition of their language. The Chinese used to call them Ch'an-t'ou ('Turbaned Heads') but this term has been dropped, being considered derogatory, and the Chinese, using their own pronunciation, now called them Weiwuerh. As a matter of fact there was for centuries no 'national' name for them; people identified themselves with the oasis they came from, like Kashgar or Turfan.|Owen Lattimore, "Return to China's Northern Frontier."

The term "Uyghur" was not used to refer to any existing ethnicity in the 19th century, but to an ancient people. A late 19th-century encyclopedia titled ''The cyclopædia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia'' said "the Uigur are the most ancient of Turkish tribes, and formerly inhabited a part of Chinese Tartary (Xinjiang), which is now occupied by a mixed population of Turk, Mongol, and [[Kalmuck]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/cyclopdiaindiaa02balfgoog#page/n922/mode/2up |title=The cyclopædia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia: commercial, industrial and scientific, products of the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms, useful arts and manufactures|author=Edward Balfour|authorlink=Edward Balfour|year=1885|publisher=[[B.

Rian Thum explored the concepts of identity among the ancestors of the modern Uyghurs in [[Altishahr]] (the native Uyghur name for eastern Turkestan or southern Xinjiang) before the adoption of the name "Uyghur" in the 1930s, referring to them by the name "Altishahri" in his article ''Modular History: Identity Maintenance before Uyghur Nationalism''. Thum indicated that Altishahri Turkis did have a sense that they were a distinctive group separate from the Turkic Andijanis to their west, the nomadic Turkic Kirghiz, the nomadic Mongol Qalmaq, and the Han Chinese [[Khitay]] before they became known as Uyghurs. There was no single name used by them to refer to themselves, the various native names Altishahris used to refer to themselves were Altishahrlik (Altishahr person), yerlik (local), Turki, and Musulmān (Muslim), the term Musulmān in this situation did not signify religious connotations, because the Altishahris would exclude other Muslim peoples like the Kirghiz when referring to themselves as Musulmān.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thum |first=Rian |date=6 August 2012 |title=Modular History: Identity Maintenance before Uyghur Nationalism |url=https://www.academia.edu/1558522/Modular_History_Identity_Maintenance_before_Uyghur_Nationalism |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |publisher=The Association for Asian Studies, Inc. 2012 |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=627–653 |doi=10.1017/S0021911812000629 |accessdate=29 September 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904025819/http://www.academia.edu/1558522/Modular_History_Identity_Maintenance_before_Uyghur_Nationalism |archivedate=4 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thum2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rian Thum|title=The Sacred Routes of Uyghur History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqOmBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA149#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=13 October 2014|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-96702-1|pages=149–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Laura J Newby has also noted that the sedentary Altishahri Turkic people felt themselves as a separate group from other Turkic Muslims since at least the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Empire And the Khanate: A Political History of Qing Relations With Khoqand C.1760-1860 |first=L.

Sheng Shicai's introduction of the "Uighur" name for the Turkic people of Xinjiang however was criticized and rejected by Turki intellectuals, such as [[Pan-Turkism|Pan-Turkist]] [[Jadid]]s and [[East Turkestan independence movement|East Turkestan independence activists]] [[Muhammad Amin Bughra]] (Mehmet Emin) and [[Masud Sabri]]. They demanded that the names "Türk" or "Türki" be used instead as the ethnonyms for their people.

The history of the Uyghur people, as with the ethnic origin of the people, is a matter of contention between Uyghur nationalists and the Chinese authority.&lt;ref name="bovingdon"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Uyghurs - strangers in their own land |author=Gardner Bovingdon |chapter=Chapter 1 - Using the Past to Serve the Present |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-231-14758-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Uyghur historians viewed the Uyghurs as the original inhabitants of Xinjiang with a long history.

===Early history===
Discovery of well-preserved [[Tarim mummies]] of a people European in appearance indicates the migration of an Indo-European people into the Tarim area at the beginning of the [[Bronze age]] around 1800 BCE.  These people probably spoke [[Tocharian languages]] and were suggested by some to be the [[Yuezhi]] mentioned in ancient Chinese texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Millward, James A. |year=2007 |title= Eurasian Crossroads: A History of Xinjiang |publisher= Columbia University Press, New York |page=14|isbn= 978-0-231-13924-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia |author=A. K Narain |chapter= Chapter 6 - Indo-Europeans in Inner Asia |editor = Denis Sinor |page=153 |isbn=978-0-521-24304-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Uyghur activists claimed these mummies to be of Uyghur origin, based partly on a word, which they argued to be Uyghur, found in written scripts associated with these mummies, although other linguists suggest it to be a [[Sogdian language|Sogdian word]] later absorbed into Uyghur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Xinjiang, China's Muslim Borderland |chapter=Chapter 14 - Contested histories |author=Gardner Bovingdon |editor=S. Frederick Starr |pages=357–358 |isbn=978-0-7656-1318-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later migrations brought peoples from the west and north-west to the Xinjiang region, probably speakers of various Iranian languages such as the [[Saka]] tribes. Other people in the region mentioned in ancient Chinese texts include the [[Dingling]] as well as the [[Xiongnu]] who fought for supremacy in the region against the Chinese for several hundred years. Some Uyghur nationalists also claimed descent from the Xiongnu (according to the Chinese historical text the ''[[Book of Wei]]'', the founder of the Uyghurs was descended from a Xiongnu ruler),{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=155}} but the view is contested by modern Chinese scholars.&lt;ref name="Tursun"/&gt;

The Yuezhi were driven away by the Xiongnu, but founded the [[Kushan Empire]], which exerted some influence in the Tarim Basin where [[Kharosthi]] texts have been found in [[Loulan Kingdom|Loulan]], [[Niya (Tarim Basin)|Niya]] and [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotan]]. Loulan and Khotan were some of the many city states that existed in the Xinjiang region during the Han Dynasty, others include [[Kucha]], [[Turfan]], [[Karasahr]] and [[Kashgar]].  The settled population of these cities later merged with incoming Turkic people such as the Uyghurs of Uyghur Khaganate to form the modern Uyghurs.

===Uyghur Khaganate===
[[File:Uighur Prince.jpg|thumb|left|An 8th-century Uyghur Khagan]]

The Uyghurs of the Uyghur Khaganate were part of a Turkic confederation called the [[Tiele people|Tiele]],{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=157}} who lived in the valleys south of [[Lake Baikal]] and around the [[Yenisei River]].  They overthrew the [[Turkic Khaganate]] and established the [[Uyghur Khaganate]].

The Uyghur Khaganate stretched from the [[Caspian Sea]] to [[Manchuria]] and lasted from 744 to 840.&lt;ref name="xinjiang"/&gt; It was administered from the imperial capital [[Ordu-Baliq]], one of the biggest ancient cities built in Mongolia. In 840, following a famine and civil war, the Uyghur Khaganate was overrun by the [[Yenisei Kirghiz]], another Turkic people. As a result, the majority of tribal groups formerly under Uyghur control dispersed and moved out of Mongolia.

===Uyghur kingdoms===
[[File:Dunhuang Uighur king.jpg|thumb|Uyghur king of the Turfan region attended by servants. [[Mogao Caves]], 409, 11th-13th century.]]

According to the ''[[New Book of Tang]]'', the Uyghurs who founded the Uyghur Khaganate dispersed after the fall of the Khaganate; some went to live amongst the Karluks, and some moved to [[Turpan]] and [[Gansu]].{{efn|"Soon the great chief Julumohe and the Kirghiz gathered a hundred thousand riders to attack the Uyghur city; they killed the Kaghan, executed Jueluowu, and burnt the royal camp. All the tribes were scattered - its ministers Sazhi and Pang Tele with fifteen clans fled to the Karluks, the remaining multitude went to [[Turfan]] and [[Guazhou County|Anxi]]."

The modern [[Yugur]]s are believed to be descendants of these Uyghurs. Ganzhou was absorbed by the [[Western Xia]] in 1036.

The second Uyghur kingdom, the [[Kingdom of Qocho]], also known as ''Uyghuristan'' in its later period, was founded in the Turpan area with its capital in Qocho (modern [[Gaochang]]) and [[Jimsar County|Beshbalik]].  The Kingdom of Qocho lasted from the ninth to the fourteenth century and proved to be longer-lasting than any power in the region, before or since.&lt;ref name="xinjiang"/&gt; The Uyghurs were originally [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]], but converted to Buddhism during this period. Qocho accepted the [[Qara Khitai]] as its overlord in 1130s, and in 1209 submitted voluntarily to the rising [[Mongol Empire]]. The Uyghurs of Kingdom of Qocho were allowed significant autonomy and played an important role as civil servants to the [[Mongol Empire]], but was finally destroyed by the [[Chagatai Khanate]] by the end of the 14th century.&lt;ref name="xinjiang"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8rLUbuZLiaIC&amp;pg=PA480|title=Dust in the Wind: Retracing Dharma Master Xuanzang's Western Pilgrimage |page=480 |isbn=9789868141988 |publisher=Rhythms Monthly |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamization===
{{main|Islamization of Xinjiang}}
{{Islam and China|groups}}

In the tenth century, the [[Karluks]], [[Yagma]]s, [[Chigils]] and other Turkic tribes founded the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]] in [[Semirechye]], Western [[Tian Shan]], and [[Kashgaria]], and later conquered [[Transoxiana]]. The Karakhanid rulers were likely to be Yaghmas who were associated with the [[Toquz Oghuz]], and some historians therefore see this as a link between the Karakhanid and the Uyghurs of the Uyghur Khaganate, although this connection is disputed by others.{{sfn|Millward|2007|p=69}}

The Karakhanids converted to Islam in the tenth century beginning with [[Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan]], the first Turkic dynasty to do so.&lt;ref name="sinor"&gt;{{citation|last = Golden|first = Peter. B.|contribution = The Karakhanids and Early Islam|year = 1990|title = The Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia|editor-last = Sinor|editor-first = Denis|page = 357|publisher = Cambridge University Press|isbn = 0-521-2-4304-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Uyghurs see the Muslim Karakhanids as an important part of their history, however, Islamization of the people of the Tarim Basin was a gradual process. The Indo-European [[Sakas|Saka]] Buddhist [[Kingdom of Khotan]] was conquered by the Turkic Muslim Karakhanids from Kashgar in the early 11th century, but Uyghur Qocho remained mainly Buddhist until the 15th century, and the conversion of the Uyghur people to Islam was not completed until the 17th century.

[[File:Chagatai Khanate (1490).png|thumb|left|[[Chagatai Khanate]] ([[Moghulistan]]) in 1490]]

The 12th and 13th century saw the domination by non-Muslim powers: first the [[Kara-Khitans]] in the 12th century, followed by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] in the 13th century. After the death of [[Genghis Khan]] in 1227, Transoxiana and Kashgar became the domain of his second son, [[Chagatai Khan]]. The [[Chagatai Khanate]] split into two in the 1340s, and the area of the Chagatai Khanate where the modern Uyghurs live became part of [[Moghulistan]], which meant "land of the Mongols". In the 14th century, a Chagatayid khan [[Tughlugh Timur|Tughluq Temür]] converted to Islam. His son [[Khizr Khoja]] conquered Qocho and Turfan (the core of Uyghuristan) in the 1390s, and the Uyghurs there became largely Muslim by the beginning of the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Millward2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=James A. Millward|title=Eurasian Crossroads: A History of Xinjiang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2007|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-13924-3|pages=69–}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being converted to Islam, the descendants of the previously [[Kingdom of Qocho|Buddhist Uyghurs in Turfan]] failed to retain memory of their ancestral legacy and falsely believed that the "infidel Kalmuks" ([[Dzungar people|Dzungars]]) were the ones who built Buddhist structures in their area.&lt;ref name="GibbLewis1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|author2=Bernard Lewis|author3=Johannes Hendrik Kramers |author4=Charles Pellat |author5=Joseph Schacht|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PJPrAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Brill|page=677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 14th through 17th centuries the Xinjiang region became further subdivided into Moghulistan in the north, [[Altishahr]] (Kashgar and the Tarim Basin), and the Turfan area, each often ruled separately by competing Chagatayid descendants, the [[Dughlats]], and later the [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khojas]].{{sfn|Millward|2007|p=69}}

Islam was also spread by the [[Sufis]], and branches of its [[Naqshbandi]] order were the [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khojas]] who seized control of political and military affairs in the Tarim Basin and Turfan in the 17th century.  The Khojas however split into two rival factions, the Aqtaghlik Khojas (also called the Afaqiyya) and the Qarataghlik Khojas (the Ishaqiyya). The legacy of the Khojas lasted until the 19th century. The Qarataghlik Khojas seized power in Yarkand where the Chagatai Khans ruled in the Yarkent Khanate, forcing the Aqtaghlik Afaqi Khoja into exile.

===Qing rule===
In the 17th century, the Buddhist [[Dzungar Khanate]] grew in power in [[Dzungaria]]. The [[Dzungar conquest of Altishahr]] ended the last independent Chagatai Khanate, the [[Yarkent Khanate]], after the Aqtaghlik [[Afaq Khoja]] attempt to gain aid from the [[5th Dalai Lama]] and his Dzungar Buddhist followers to help him in his struggle against the Qarataghlik Khojas. The Aqtaghlik Khojas in the Tarim Basin then became vassals to the Dzungars, who extracted heavy taxes and tribute from the Tarim Basin cities.

The expansion of the Dzungars into [[Khalkha Mongols|Khalkha Mongol]] territory in [[Mongolia]] brought them into direct conflict with [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]] in the late 17th century, and in the process also brought Chinese presence back into the region a thousand years after Tang China lost control of the [[Western Regions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= |title=Wild West China: The Taming of Xinjiang |author=Christian Tyler|page=55 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year= 2004 |isbn=978-0813535333 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dzungar–Qing War]] lasted a decade. During the Dzungar conflict, two Aqtaghlik brothers, the so-called "Younger Khoja" ({{zh|c=霍集占}}), also known as Khwāja-i Jahān, and his sibling, the Elder Khoja ({{zh|c=波羅尼都}}), also known as Burhān al-Dīn, after being appointed as vassals in the Tarim Basin by the Dzungars, first joined the Qing and rebelled against Dzungar rule until the final Qing victory over the Dzungars, then they rebelled against the Qing, an action which prompted the invasion and conquest of the Tarim Basin by the Qing in 1759. The Uyghurs of Turfan and Hami such as [[Emin Khoja]] were allies of the Qing in this conflict, and these Uyghurs also helped the Qing to rule the Altishahr Uyghurs in the Tarim Basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Millward, James A. |year=2007 |title= Eurasian Crossroads: A History of Xinjiang |publisher= Columbia University Press, New York |page=101 |isbn= 978-0-231-13924-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3107653|title=The Begs of Xinjiang: Between Two Worlds|last=Newby|first=L.

The [[Ten Great Campaigns|final campaign against the Dzungars in the 1750s]] ended with the [[Dzungar genocide]].

===Modern era===
In 1912, the Qing Dynasty was replaced by the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]]. By 1920, Pan-Turkic [[Jadidist]] Islamists had become a challenge to Chinese warlord [[Yang Zengxin]] who controlled Xinjiang. Uyghurs staged several uprisings against Chinese rule. Twice, in 1933 and 1944, the Uyghurs successfully gained their independence (backed by the Soviet Communist leader [[Joseph Stalin]]): the [[First East Turkestan Republic]] was a short-lived attempt at independence around [[Kashgar Prefecture|Kashghar]], and it was destroyed during the [[Kumul Rebellion]] by [[Hui people|Chinese Muslim]] army under General [[Ma Zhancang]] and [[Ma Fuyuan]] at the [[Battle of Kashgar (1934)]]. The [[Second East Turkestan Republic]] was a Soviet puppet Communist state that existed from 1944 to 1949 in the three districts of what is now [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture]] during the [[Ili Rebellion]] while the majority of Xinjiang was under the control of the Republic of China. Religious Uyghur separatists from the First East Turkestan Republic like [[Isa Yusuf Alptekin]] and [[Muhammad Amin Bughra]] opposed the Soviet Communist backed Uyghur separatists of the Second East Turkestan Republic under Ehmetjan Qasim and they supported the Republic of China during the Ili Rebellion.

[[File:Xinjiang nationalities by prefecture 2000.png|thumb|Map showing the distribution of ethnicities in [[Xinjiang]] according to census figures from 2000, the prefectures with Uyghur majorities are in blue.]]

Mao declared the founding of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] on October 1, 1949. He turned the Second East Turkistan Republic into the [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture]], and appointed [[Saifuddin Azizi]] as the region's first Communist Party governor. Many Republican loyalists fled into exile in Turkey and Western countries. The name Xinjiang was changed to Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, where Uyghurs are the largest ethnicity, mostly concentrated in the south-western Xinjiang.&lt;ref&gt;2000年人口普查中国民族人口资料，民族出版社，2003/9 ({{ISBN|7-105-05425-5}})&lt;/ref&gt;
The Xinjiang conflict is an ongoing separatist conflict in China's far-west province of Xinjiang, whose northern region is known as Dzungaria and whose southern region (the Tarim Basin) is known as East Turkestan. Uyghur separatists and independence movements claim that the region is not a part of China, but that the Second East Turkestan Republic was illegally incorporated by the PRC in 1949 and has since been under Chinese occupation.
Uyghur identity remains fragmented, as some support a [[Pan-Islamism|Pan-Islamic]] vision, exemplified by the [[East Turkestan Islamic Movement]], while others support a [[Pan-Turkism|Pan-Turkic]] vision, such as the [[East Turkestan Liberation Organization]]. A third group would like a "Uyghur[[-stan|stan]]" state, such as the [[East Turkestan independence movement]]. As a result, "[n]o Uyghur or East Turkestan group speaks for all Uyghurs, although it might claim to", and Uyghurs in each of these camps have committed violence against other Uyghurs who they think are too assimilated to Chinese or Russian society or are not religious enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Constituting the Uyghur in U.S.-China Relations: The Geopolitics of Identity Formation in the War on Terrorism|first=Gaye|last=Christofferson|journal=[[Strategic Insights]]|publisher=Center for Contemporary Conflict|date=September 2002|volume=1|issue=7|url=http://www.nps.edu/Academics/centers/ccc/publications/OnlineJournal/2002/sept02/eastAsia.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224025632/http://www.nps.edu/Academics/centers/ccc/publications/OnlineJournal/2002/sept02/eastAsia.pdf|archivedate=2010-02-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindful not to take sides, Uyghur "leaders" such as [[Rebiya Kadeer]] mainly try to garner international support for the "rights and interests of the Uyghurs", including the right to demonstrate, although the Chinese government has accused her of orchestrating the deadly [[July 2009 Ürümqi riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90002/96417/6695082.html|title=Unveiled Rebiya Kadeer: a Uighur Dalai Lama|date=2009-07-07|accessdate=2010-08-21|publisher=[[People's Daily]]|first=Li|last=Hongmei|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109163217/http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90002/96417/6695082.html|archivedate=2010-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eric Enno Tamm's 2011 book states that, "Authorities have censored Uyghur writers and 'lavished funds' on official histories that depict Chinese territorial expansion into ethnic borderlands as 'unifications (tongyi), never as conquests (zhengfu) or [[annexation]]s (tunbing)' "&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/663952959|title=The horse that leaps through clouds: a tale of espionage, the Silk Road, and the rise of modern China|last=Enno|first=Tamm, Eric|date=2011|publisher=Counterpoint Press|isbn=9781582437347|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=194|oclc=663952959|quote="Yet the Uyghurs have stubbornly resisted the Chinese Communist Party's idealogical claims, Bovingdon writes, in 'an enduring struggle over history that is also a battle' over the future of their land and their own fate."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Uyghurs are a [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] population with Eastern and Western Eurasian anthropometric and genetic traits. Uyghurs are thus one of the many populations of Central Eurasia that can be considered to be genetically related to Caucasoid and East Asian populations.  However, various scientific studies differ on the size of each component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.khazaria.com/genetics/uygurs.html |title=Uygur Genetics - DNA of Turkic people from Xinjiang, China |publisher=Khazaria.com |accessdate=2012-04-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529041543/http://www.khazaria.com/genetics/uygurs.html |archivedate=2012-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One study, using samples from Hetian ([[Hotan]]) only, found that Uyghurs have 60 per cent European ancestry and 40 per cent East Asian ancestry.&lt;ref name="ajhg"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shuhua Xu |author2=Wei Huang |author3=Ji Qian |author4=Li Jin  |last-author-amp=yes | title = Analysis of Genomic Admixture in Uyghur and Its Implication in Mapping Strategy |journal=Am J Hum Genet | date=April 11, 2008 | volume =  82 | issue = 4| pages =  883–89 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.01.017  |pmc=2427216 | pmid=18355773}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A further study showed slightly greater European component (52 per cent European) in the Uyghur population in southern Xinjiang, but slightly greater East Asian component (47 per cent European) in the northern Uyghur population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shuhua Xu  |author2=Li Jin |lastauthoramp=yes | title = A Genome-wide Analysis of Admixture in Uyghurs and a High-Density Admixture Map for Disease-Gene Discovery|journal=Am J Hum Genet | date=September 2008 | volume =  83 | issue = 3 | pages =  322–36 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.08.001 |pmc=2556439 | pmid=18760393 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study used a larger sample of individuals from a wider area, and found only about 30 per cent European component to the admixture.&lt;ref name="cite journal|pmc=2790568"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2790568|title=Genetic Landscape of Eurasia and "Admixture" in Uyghurs|year=2009|volume=85|issue=6|pmid=20004770|last1=Li|first1=H|last2=Cho|first2=K|last3=Kidd|first3=JR|last4=Kidd|first4=KK|pages=934–7; author reply 937–9|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.10.024|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study on [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup|mitochondrial DNA]] (therefore the matrilineal genetic contribution) found the frequency of western Eurasian-specific haplogroup in Uyghurs to be 42.6 per cent, and East Asian haplogroup to be 57.4 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yao YG, Kong QP, Wang CY, Zhu CL, Zhang YP |title=Different matrilineal contributions to genetic structure of ethnic groups in the silk road region in China |journal=Mol Biol Evol |date=Dec 2004 |volume=21 |issue=12 |pages=2265–80 |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/12/2265.long |pmid=15317881 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msh238 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126101102/http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/12/2265.long |archivedate=2013-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A further study shows that the western-Eurasian patrilineal Y-DNA haplogroup in Uyghurs is around 65% to 70%, and east-Asian Y-DNA haplogroup around 30% to 35%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Male Demography in East Asia: A North–South Contrast in Human Population Expansion Times|url=http://www.genetics.org/content/genetics/172/4/2431.full.pdf|format=PDF|website=genetics.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309043629/http://www.genetics.org/content/genetics/172/4/2431.full.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The admixture may be the result of a continuous gene flow from populations of European and Asian descent, or may have been formed by a single event of admixture during a short period of time (the hybrid isolation model). If a hybrid isolation model is assumed, it can be estimated that the hypothetical admixture event occurred about 126 generations ago, or 2,520 years ago assuming twenty years per generation.&lt;ref name="ajhg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2008/03/uyghurs-are-hybrids/ |title=Uyghurs are hybrids &amp;#124; Gene Expression &amp;#124; Discover Magazine |publisher=Blogs.discovermagazine.com |accessdate=2011-08-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130171248/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2008/03/uyghurs-are-hybrids/ |archivedate=2011-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the paper by Li et al.:

{{Quotation|... the western East Asians are more closely related to Uyghurs than the eastern East Asians.&amp;nbsp;... STRUCTURE cannot distinguish recent admixture from a cline of other origin, and these analyses cannot prove admixture in the Uyghurs; however, historical records indicate that the present Uyghurs were formed by admixture between [[Tocharians]] from the west and Orkhon Uyghurs (Wugusi-Huihu, according to present Chinese pronunciation) from the east in the 8th century AD. The Uyghur Empire was originally located in Mongolia and conquered the Tocharian tribes in Xinjiang. Tocharians such as [[Kroran]] have been shown by archaeological findings to appear phenotypically similar to northern and central Europeans, whereas the Orkhon Uyghur people were clearly Mongolians. The two groups of people subsequently mixed in Xinjiang to become one population, the present Uyghurs. We do not know the genetic constitution of the Tocharians, but if they were similar to western Siberians, such as the Khanty, admixture would already be biased toward similarity with East Asian populations.&lt;ref name="cite journal|pmc=2790568"/&gt;}}

The paper further concludes:
{{Quotation|... that the Uyghurs' genetic structure is more similar to East Asians than to Europeans, in contrast to the reports by Xu and Jin, whose work may have been affected by their sparse population coverage. The median line of the Eurasian genetic landscape appears to lie to the west of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. When we have collected more data on these 34 populations, we should be able to refine these estimates.&lt;ref name="cite journal|pmc=2790568"/&gt;}}

The physical features of many Uighurs, characterized by a mixture of European and East Asian characteristics, are considered "exotic" in China; in [[Film industry|theatre]] the use of Uighur actors has become common because they can play the roles of foreign characters while at the same time speaking flawless [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/09/27/553703866/for-some-chinese-uighurs-modeling-is-a-path-to-success|title=For Some Chinese Uighurs, Modeling Is A Path To Success|agency=[[National Public Radio]]|work=All Things Considered|date=27 September 2017|accessdate=27 October 2017|author=Rob Schmitz|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027112133/http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/09/27/553703866/for-some-chinese-uighurs-modeling-is-a-path-to-success|archivedate=27 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
{{Main|Uyghur language}}
[[File:Map of language areas of Xinjiang.png|thumb|Map of language families in Xinjiang]]

The ancient people of the Tarim Basin originally spoke different languages such as [[Saka language|Saka]] (Khotanese), [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]] and [[Gāndhārī language|Gandhari]].  The Turkic people who moved into region in the 9th century brought with them their languages which slowly supplanted the original tongues of the local inhabitants. By the 11th century, it was noted by [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]] that the Uyghurs (of Qocho) spoke a pure Turkic language, but they also still spoke another language among themselves and have two different scripts. He also noted that the people of Khotan did not know Turkic well, and have their own language and script ([[Saka language|Khotanese]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SAX5ohFkcVgC&amp;pg=PA72#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=slamic Central Asia: An Anthology of Historical Sources|authors=Scott Cameron Levi, Ron Sela |page=72 |publisher=Indiana University Press |year= 2009|isbn= 978-0253353856 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers of the Karakhanid period, al-Kashgari and [[Yusuf Balasagun]], referred to their Turkic language as ''Khāqāniyya'' (meaning royal), or the "language of Kashgar", or simply Turkic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mehmet Fuat Köprülü|author2=Gary Leiser|author3=Robert Dankoff|title=Early Mystics in Turkish Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_v6IWkCLnEwC&amp;pg=PA158#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2006|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-36686-1|pages=158–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edmund Herzig|title=The Age of the Seljuqs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ML2bBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23|date=30 November 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-78076-947-9|pages=23–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern Uyghur language is classified under the [[Karluk languages|Karluk]] branch of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic language family]]. It is closely related to [[Äynu language|Äynu]], [[Lop language|Lop]], [[Ili Turki language|Ili Turki]], and [[Chagatay language|Chagatay]] (the East Karluk languages), and slightly less closely to [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] (which is West Karluk).  The Uyghur language is an [[agglutinative language]] and has a [[subject-object-verb]] word order.  It has [[vowel harmony]] like other Turkic languages, and has noun and verb [[Grammatical case|cases]], but lacks distinction of gender forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~celcar/pamphlets/Uyghur.pdf |title=Uyghur |work=Center for Languages of the Central Asian Region |publisher=Indiana University |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607223811/http://www.indiana.edu/~celcar/pamphlets/uyghur.pdf |archivedate=2015-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Uyghurs have adopted a number of scripts for their language. The [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic script]], known as the [[Chagatay alphabet]], was adopted along with Islam. This alphabet is known as Kona Yëziq (old script). Political changes in the 20th century led to numerous reforms of the writing scripts, for example the [[Cyrillic]]-based [[Uyghur Cyrillic alphabet]], a Latin [[Uyghur New Script]], and later a reformed [[Uyghur Arabic alphabet]] which represents all vowels unlike Kona Yëziq. A new Latin version, the [[Uyghur Latin alphabet]], was also devised in the 21st century.

===Literature===
The literary works of the ancient Uyghurs were mostly translations of Buddhist and Manichaean religious texts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hk.plm.org.cn/e_book/xz-11348.pdf 西域、 敦煌文献所见回鹊之佛经翻译]{{dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there were also narrative, poetic, and epic works apparently original to the Uyghurs.  However, it is the literature of Kara-Khanid period that is considered by modern Uyghurs to be the important part of their literary traditions.  Amongst these are Islamic religious texts and histories of [[Turkic peoples]], and important works surviving from that era are ''[[Kutadgu Bilig]]'' "Wisdom of Royal Glory" by [[Yusuf Khass Hajib]] (1069–70), [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]]'s ''Dīwānu l-Luġat al-Turk'' "A Dictionary of Turkic Dialects" (1072), and Ehmed Yükneki's ''Etebetulheqayiq''. Modern Uyghur religious literature includes the [[Taẕkirah]], biographies of Islamic religious figures and saints.&lt;ref name="Thum2014 2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rian Thum|title=The Sacred Routes of Uyghur History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pP6EBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=tazkirah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwA2oVChMIhezNksWPyQIViecmCh29Kw_s#v=onepage&amp;q=tazkirah&amp;f=false|date=13 October 2014|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-59855-3|pages=113–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thum |first=Rian |last2= |first2= |date=6 August 2012 |title=Modular History: Identity Maintenance before Uyghur Nationalism |url=https://www.academia.edu/1558522/Modular_History_Identity_Maintenance_before_Uyghur_Nationalism |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |publisher=The Association for Asian Studies, Inc. 2012 |volume=71 |issue=03 |pages=632 |doi=10.1017/S0021911812000629 |accessdate=29 September 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904025819/http://www.academia.edu/1558522/Modular_History_Identity_Maintenance_before_Uyghur_Nationalism |archivedate=4 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Shaw|title=A Sketch of the Turki Language: As Spoken in Eastern Turkistan ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dw7gAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1878|pages=102–109}}{{cite book|author=Asiatic Society (Calcutta, India)|title=Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0G0yAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA325#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1877|pages=325–347}}{{cite book|title=Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qLoIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA325#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1877|publisher=G.H.

[[File:Uyghur Meshrep.jpg|thumb|Uyghur Meshrep musicians in Yarkand.]]

[[Muqam]] is the classical musical style. The '''12 Muqams''' are the national oral epic of the Uyghurs. The muqam system developed among the Uyghur in north-west [[China]] and [[Central Asia]] over approximately the last 1500 years from the Arabic [[maqama]]t modal system that has led to many musical genres among peoples of [[Eurasia]] and [[North Africa]]. Uyghurs have local muqam systems named after the oasis towns of [[Xinjiang]], such as [[Dolan people|Dolan]], [[Ghulja|Ili]], [[Kumul (city)|Kumul]] and [[Turpan]]. The most fully developed at this point is the Western [[Tarim Basin|Tarim]] region's 12 muqams, which are now a large canon of music and songs recorded from the traditional performers [[Turdi Akhun]] and [[Omar Akhun]] among others in the 1950s and edited into a more systematic system. Although the folk performers probably improvised their songs as in Turkish [[Taqsim|taksim]] performances, the present institutional canon is performed as fixed compositions by ensembles.

The Uyghur Muqam of Xinjiang has been designated by U.N.E.S.C.O. as part of the Intangible Heritage of Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?RL=21 |title=UNESCO Culture Sector - Intangible Heritage - 2003 Convention : |publisher=Unesco.org |accessdate=2011-08-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514084005/http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?RL=21 |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amannisa Khan]], sometimes called Amanni Shahan, (1526–1560) is credited with collecting and thereby preserving the Twelve Muqam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kashi.gov.cn/English/Tourism/Customs/12muqams.htm |title=Kashgar Welcome You! |publisher=Kashi.gov.cn |accessdate=2011-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721181818/http://www.kashi.gov.cn/English/Tourism/Customs/12muqams.htm |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian scholar Pantusov writes that the Uyghurs manufactured their own musical instruments; they had 62 different kinds of musical instruments and in every Uyghur home there used to be an instrument called a "[[Dutar|duttar]]".

During the late-19th and early-20th centuries, scientific and archaeological expeditions to the region of Xinjiang's [[Silk Road]] discovered numerous cave temples, monastery ruins, and wall paintings, as well as miniatures, books, and documents. There are 77 [[Rock cut architecture|rock-cut]] caves at the site.

===Education===
Historically, the education level of Old Uyghur people was higher than the other ethnicities around them. The Buddhist Uyghurs of Qocho became the civil servants of Mongol Empire and Old Uyghur Buddhists enjoyed a high status in the Mongol empire. In the Islamic era, education may be provided by the mosques and madrassas. During the Qing era, Chinese Confucian schools were also set up in Xinjiang,&lt;ref name="education"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA142 |title=Eurasian crossroads: a history of Xinjiang|author=James A.

In the late nineteenth and early 20th century, school were often located in mosques and ''[[madrassah]]''. Mosques ran the informal schools, known as [[Maktab|mektep]] or ''maktab'', attached to the mosques,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.

Beginning in the early 20th century, secular education became more widespread. Early in the [[PRC]] era, Uyghurs may have a choice from two separate secular school systems, one conducted in their own language, and one offering instructions only in Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = English language education across greater China|last = Anwei|first = Feng|publisher = |isbn = |location = |pages = 262}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Uyghurs link the preservation of their cultural and religious identity with the language of instruction in schools and therefore prefer the Uyghur language school.&lt;ref name="benson"&gt;{{cite book |title=Xinjiang, China's Muslim Borderland |chapter=Chapter 7 - Education and Social Mobility among Minority Populations in Xinjiang |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GXj4a3gss8wC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=Linda Benson |editor=S.

By 2002 [[Xinjiang University]], originally a bilingual institution, had ceased offering courses in the Uyghur language.  From 2004 onward, the government policy is that classes should be conducted in Chinese as much as possible, and in some selected regions, instruction in Chinese began in the first grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Xinjiang Conflict: Uyghur Identity, Language Policy, and Political Discourse |url=http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/PS015.pdf |author=Arienne M.

The level of education attainment among Uyghurs is generally lower than that of the Han Chinese; this may be due to the cost of education, the lack of proficiency in the Chinese language (now the main medium of instruction) among many Uyghurs, and a poorer employment prospect for Uyghur graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://sites.miis.edu/comparativeeducation/files/2013/01/Education-Integration-and-the-Uyghurs.pdf |title=The Xinjiang Class: Education, Integration, and the Uyghurs |author=Timothy A.

Similar to other traditional medicine, diagnosis is usually made through checking the pulse, symptoms, and disease history, and then the pharmacist pounds up different dried herbs, making personalized medicines according to the prescription. Modern Uyghur medical hospitals adopted modern medical science and medicine and applied evidence-based pharmaceutical technology to traditional medicines. Historically, Uyghur medical knowledge has contributed to Chinese medicine in terms of medical treatments, medicinal materials and ingredients, and symptom detection. It introduced to Chinese medicine the medical use of snakes, opium and many new kinds of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 中国医学百科全书：维吾尔医学|publisher = 上海科学技术出版社|date = 2005-09-01|isbn = 9787532377930|location = China|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Qing era the Uyghurs used Chinese medicine.&lt;ref name="Bellér-Hann2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ildikó Bellér-Hann|title=Community Matters in Xinjiang, 1880-1949: Towards a Historical Anthropology of the Uyghur|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cF4lMj8skvoC&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2008|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-16675-0|pages=81–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Xinjiang cuisine}}
[[File:Uyghur polu closeup.JPG|thumb|Uyghur ''[[Pilaf|polu]]'' (پولۇ, ''полу'')]]
Uyghur food shows both [[Central Asian cuisine|Central Asian]] and [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] elements. A typical Uyghur dish is ''polu'' (or [[pilaf]]), a dish found throughout Central Asia. In a common version of the Uyghur ''polu'', carrots and mutton (or chicken) are first fried in oil with onions, then rice and water are added, and the whole dish is steamed. Raisins and dried apricots may also be added. ''Kawaplar'' ([[Uyghur language|Uyghur]]: ''Каваплар'') or ''[[chuanr]]'' (i.e., [[kebab]]s or grilled meat) are also found here. Another common Uyghur dish is ''[[leghmen]]'' (لەغمەن, ''ләғмән''), a noodle dish with a stir-fried topping (''säy'', from Chinese ''cai'', 菜) usually made from mutton and vegetables, such as tomatoes, onions, green bell peppers, chili peppers, and cabbage. This dish is likely to have originated from the Chinese ''[[lamian]]'', but its flavor and preparation method are distinctively Uyghur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NKCU3BdeBbEC&amp;pg=PA190#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Situating the Uyghurs between China and Central Asia|chapter= Chapter 10, ''Polo'', ''läghmän'', ''So Säy'': Situating Uyghur Food Between Central Asia and China|author=M Critina Cesàro|year=2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|isbn=0-7546-7041-4|pages=185–202|accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uyghur food (''Уйғур Йәмәклири'', ''Uyghur Yemekliri'') is characterized by [[Lamb and mutton|mutton]], [[beef]], [[Camel#Meat|camel]] (solely [[Bactrian camel|bactrian]]), [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[goose]], [[carrot]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[onion]]s, [[Capsicum|peppers]], [[eggplant]], [[celery]], various [[Dairy product|dairy foods]], and [[fruit]]s.

A Uyghur-style breakfast consists of [[tea]] with home-baked [[bread]], [[hardened yogurt]], [[olive]]s, [[honey]], [[raisin]]s, and [[almond]]s. Uyghurs like to treat guests with tea, [[naan]], and fruit before the main dishes are ready.

''[[Sangza]]'' ([[Uyghur language|Uyghur]]: ساڭزا, ''Саңза'') are crispy fried [[wheat flour]] dough twists, a holiday specialty. ''[[Samosa|Samsa]]'' ([[Uyghur language|Uyghur]]: سامسا, ''Самса'') are lamb [[pie]]s baked in a special brick oven. ''[[Youtazi]]'' is steamed multi-layer bread. ''[[Göshnan]]'' ([[Uyghur language|Uyghur]]: گۆشنان, ''Гөшнан'') are pan-grilled lamb pies. ''[[Pamirdin]]'' ([[Uyghur language|Uyghur]]: ''Памирдин'') are baked pies stuffed with lamb, carrots, and onions. ''[[Chorba|Shorpa]]'' is lamb [[soup]] ([[Uyghur language|Uyghur]]: شۇرپا, ''Шорпа''). Other dishes include ''[[Tohax|Toghach]]'' ([[Uyghur language|Uyghur]]: ''Тоғач'') (a type of [[tandoor bread]]) and ''[[Doner kebab|Tunurkawab]]'' ([[Uyghur language|Uyghur]]: ''Тунуркаваб''). ''Girde'' ([[Uyghur language|Uyghur]]: ''Гирде'') is also a very popular [[bagel]]-like bread with a hard and crispy crust that is soft inside.

A cake sold by Uyghurs is the traditional Uyghur nut cake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://offbeatchina.com/an-unbelievably-expensive-piece-of-xinjiang-nut-cake-and-what-it-tells-about-the-ethnic-policy-in-china |title=An unbelievably expensive piece of Xinjiang nut cake and what it tells about the ethnic policy in China |date= December 4, 2012|work=Offbeat China }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://world.time.com/2012/12/05/dont-let-them-eat-cake-how-ethnic-tensions-in-china-explode-on-the-streets/ |title= Don’t Let Them Eat Cake: How Ethnic Tensions in China Explode on the Streets |author= Austin Ramzy |date= December 5, 2012 |work= Time |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121212194419/http://world.time.com/2012/12/05/dont-let-them-eat-cake-how-ethnic-tensions-in-china-explode-on-the-streets/ |archivedate= December 12, 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/xinjiang-nut-cake-scandal-in-china-2012-12 |title=Chinese Racial Tensions Flare Over An Overpriced Nut Cake |author=Adam Taylor |date=December 4, 2012 |work=Business Insider |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821152730/http://www.businessinsider.com/xinjiang-nut-cake-scandal-in-china-2012-12 |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
