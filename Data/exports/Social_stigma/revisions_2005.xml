This means that its victims are mostly [[minority|minorities]] which have a common characteristic which sets them apart from other members of society. 
The result is a vicious circle: marginalised groups are stigmatized, stigmatization leads to social exclusion and marginalised groups are formed. 

Examples of social stigmas are physical or mental [[handicap]]s and [[disorder]]s, as well as [[homosexuality]] or affiliation with a specific [[nationality]], [[religion]] or [[ethnicity]] (as is often the case for the [[Roma people]]).
