'''Social stigma''' is the disapproval of, or [[discrimination]] against, an individual or group based on perceived characteristics that serve to distinguish them from other members of a society. Social stigmas are commonly related to [[culture]], [[gender]], [[race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[socioeconomic status|socioeconomic class]], [[Aging|age]], [[sexual orientation]], [[body shaming|body image]], [[Disability|physical disability]], [[Human intelligence|intelligence]] or lack thereof, and [[health]]. Some stigma may be obvious, while others are known as concealable stigmas that must be revealed through disclosure. Stigma can also be against oneself, stemming from negatively viewed personal attributes in a way that can result in a "spoiled identity" (i.e., self-stigma).&lt;ref&gt;[[Erving Goffman|Goffman, E.]] (1963).

==Description==
Stigma (plural stigmas or ''stigmata'') is a Greek word that in its origins referred to a type of marking or the [[tattoo]] that was cut or burned into the skin of people with criminal records, slaves, or those seen as traitors in order to visibly identify them as supposedly blemished or morally polluted persons. These individuals were to be avoided particularly in public places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goffman |first=Erving |author-link=Erving Goffman |title=Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity |date=2009 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0-671-62244-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/stigmanotesonman00goff_0/page/1 1] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/stigmanotesonman00goff_0/page/1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social stigmas can occur in many different forms. The most common deal with [[culture]], [[gender]], [[race (classification of human beings)|race]], religion, [[illness]] and [[disease]]. Individuals who are stigmatized usually feel different and devalued by others.

Stigma may also be described as a label that associates a person to a set of unwanted characteristics that form a stereotype. It is also affixed.&lt;ref name="Jacoby-2005"&gt;{{citation |vauthors=Jacoby A, Snape D, Baker GA |year=2005 |title=Epilepsy and Social Identity: the Stigma of a Chronic Neurological Disorder |journal=Lancet Neurology |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=171–8 |pmid=15721827 |doi=10.1016/s1474-4422(05)70020-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once people identify and label one's differences, others will assume that is just how things are and the person will remain stigmatized until the stigmatizing attribute is undetectable. A considerable amount of generalization is required to create groups, meaning that people will put someone in a general group regardless of how well the person actually fits into that group. However, the attributes that society selects differ according to time and place. What is considered out of place in one society could be the norm in another. When society categorizes individuals into certain groups the labeled person is subjected to status loss and [[discrimination]].&lt;ref name="Jacoby-2005"/&gt; Society will start to form expectations about those groups once the cultural stereotype is secured.

Stigma may affect the [[behavior]] of those who are stigmatized. Those who are [[stereotype]]d often start to act in ways that their stigmatizers expect of them. It not only changes their behavior, but it also shapes their [[emotion]]s and [[belief]]s.&lt;ref name="Major-O'Brien-2005"/&gt; Members of stigmatized social groups often face prejudice that causes depression (i.e. deprejudice).&lt;ref name="Cox et al. (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cox |first1=William T. L. |last2=Abramson |first2=Lyn Y. |last3=Devine |first3=Patricia G. |last4=Hollon |first4=Steven D. |year=2012 |title=Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Depression: The Integrated Perspective |journal=[[Perspectives on Psychological Science]] |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=427–49 |doi=10.1177/1745691612455204 |pmid=26168502|s2cid=1512121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These stigmas put a person's [[social identity]] in threatening situations, such as [[low self-esteem]]. Because of this, identity theories have become highly researched. Identity threat theories can go hand-in-hand with [[labeling theory]].

Members of stigmatized groups start to become aware that they are not being treated the same way and know they are likely being discriminated against. Studies have shown that "by 10 years of age, most children are aware of cultural stereotypes of different groups in society, and children who are members of stigmatized groups are aware of cultural types at an even younger age."&lt;ref name="Major-O'Brien-2005"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brenda Major |author2=Laurie T.

==Main theories and contributions==

===Émile Durkheim===
French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] was the first to explore stigma as a social phenomenon in 1895. He wrote:

''Imagine a society of saints, a perfect cloister of exemplary individuals. Crimes or deviance, properly so-called, will there be unknown; but faults, which appear venial to the layman, will there create the same scandal that the ordinary offense does in ordinary consciousnesses. If then, this society has the power to judge and punish, it will define these acts as criminal (or deviant) and will treat them as such.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Émile Durkheim]] (1982). ''Rules of Sociological Method'' (1895) The Free Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erving Goffman===
[[Erving Goffman]] described stigma as a phenomenon whereby an individual with an attribute which is deeply discredited by their society is rejected as a result of the attribute. Goffman saw stigma as a process by which the reaction of others spoils normal identity.&lt;ref name="Goffman-1963"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity|last=Goffman|first=Erving|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|year=1963|isbn=978-0-671-62244-2|author-link=Erving Goffman|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/stigmanotesonman00goff_0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, he explained that what constituted this attribute would change over time.  "It should be seen that a language of relationships, not attributes, is really needed.  An attribute that stigmatizes one type of possessor can confirm the usualness of another, and therefore is neither credible nor discreditable as a thing in itself."&lt;ref name="Goffman-1963" /&gt;

In Goffman's theory of social stigma, a stigma is an attribute, behavior, or reputation which is socially discrediting in a particular way: it causes an individual to be mentally classified by others in an undesirable, rejected [[stereotype]] rather than in an accepted, normal one. Goffman defined stigma as a special kind of gap between ''virtual social identity'' and ''actual social identity'':

{{Blockquote|While a stranger is present before us, evidence can arise of his possessing an attribute that makes him different from others in the category of persons available for him to be, and of a less desirable kind—in the extreme, a person who is quite thoroughly bad, or dangerous, or weak. He is thus reduced in our minds from a whole and usual person to a tainted discounted one. Such an attribute is a stigma, especially when its discrediting effect is very extensive [...] It constitutes a special discrepancy between virtual and actual social identity. (Goffman 1963:3). |author=|title=|source=}}

====The stigmatized, the normal, and the wise====
Goffman divides the individual's relation to a stigma into three categories:
# the ''stigmatized'' being those who bear the stigma;
# the ''normals'' being those who do not bear the stigma; and
# the ''wise'' being those among the normals who are accepted by the stigmatized as understanding and accepting of their condition (borrowing the term from the homosexual community).

The wise normals are not merely those who are in some sense accepting of the stigma; they are, rather, "those whose special situation has made them intimately privy to the secret life of the stigmatized individual and sympathetic with it, and who find themselves accorded a measure of acceptance, a measure of courtesy membership in the clan." That is, they are accepted ''by'' the stigmatized as "honorary members" of the stigmatized group. "Wise persons are the marginal men before whom the individual with a fault need feel no shame nor exert self-control, knowing that in spite of his failing he will be seen as an ordinary other," Goffman notes that the wise may in certain social situations also bear the stigma with respect to other normals: that is, they may also be stigmatized for being wise. An example is a parent of a homosexual; another is a white woman who is seen socializing with a black man (assuming social milieus in which homosexuals and dark-skinned people are stigmatized).

A 2012 study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith, R. |title=Segmenting an Audience into the Own, the Wise, and Normals: A Latent Class Analysis of Stigma-Related Categories |journal=Communication Research Reports |edition=29 |pages=257–65 |year=2012 |doi=10.1080/08824096.2012.704599 |volume=29|issue=4 |s2cid=144433184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed empirical support for the existence of the own, the wise, and normals as separate groups; but the wise appeared in two forms: active wise and passive wise. The active wise encouraged challenging stigmatization and educating stigmatizers, but the passive wise did not.

====Ethical considerations====
Goffman emphasizes that the stigma relationship is one between an individual and a social setting with a given set of expectations; thus, everyone at different times will play both roles of stigmatized and stigmatizer (or, as he puts it, "normal"). Goffman gives the example that "some jobs in America cause holders without the expected college education to conceal this fact; other jobs, however, can lead to the few of their holders who have a higher education to keep this a secret, lest they are marked as failures and outsiders. Similarly, a middle-class boy may feel no compunction in being seen going to the library; a professional criminal, however, writes [about keeping his library visits secret]." He also gives the example of blacks being stigmatized among whites, and whites being stigmatized among blacks.

Individuals actively cope with stigma in ways that vary across stigmatized groups, across individuals within stigmatized groups, and within individuals across time and situations.&lt;ref name="Levin &amp; van Laar, 2004"&gt;{{citation |author1=Shana Levin |author2=Colette van Laar |year=2004 |title=Stigma and Group Inequality: Social Psychological Perspectives |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |isbn=978-0805844153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====The stigmatized=====
The stigmatized are ostracized, [[devalued]], scorned, shunned and ignored. They experience [[discrimination]] in the realms of employment and housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bordieri | first1 = J. E. | last2 = Drehmer | first2 = D.

F.; Kleck, R. E.; Hebl, M. R.; Hull, J. G. (2000). ''The Social Psychology of Stigma''. Guilford Press. {{ISBN|1-57230-573-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the experience of being stigmatized may take a toll on self-esteem, academic achievement, and other outcomes, many people with stigmatized attributes have high self-esteem, perform at high levels, are happy and appear to be quite resilient to their negative experiences.&lt;ref name="Heatherton-2000"/&gt;

There are also "positive stigma": it is possible to be too rich, or too smart. This is noted by Goffman (1963:141) in his discussion of leaders, who are subsequently given license to deviate from some behavioral norms because they have contributed far above the expectations of the group. This can result in social stigma.

=====The stigmatizer=====
From the perspective of the stigmatizer, stigmatization involves threat, aversion{{clarify|date=January 2012}} and sometimes the depersonalization of others into stereotypic caricatures. Stigmatizing others can serve several functions for an individual, including [[self-esteem]] enhancement, control enhancement, and anxiety buffering, through ''downward-comparison''—comparing oneself to less fortunate others can increase one's own subjective sense of [[subjective well-being|well-being]] and therefore boost one's self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Heatherton-2000"/&gt;

21st-century social psychologists consider stigmatizing and stereotyping to be a normal consequence of people's cognitive abilities and limitations, and of the social information and experiences to which they are exposed.&lt;ref name="Heatherton-2000"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Current views of stigma, from the perspectives of both the stigmatizer and the stigmatized person, consider the process of stigma to be highly situationally specific, dynamic, complex and nonpathological.&lt;ref name="Heatherton-2000"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Gerhard Falk===
German-born sociologist and historian [[Gerhard Falk]] wrote:&lt;ref name="Falk-2001"&gt;Gerhard Falk (2001). [https://web.archive.org/web/20060501220023/http://www.buffalostate.edu/sociology/falkg.xml?username=falkg ''STIGMA: How We Treat Outsiders''], Prometheus Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

''All societies will always stigmatize some conditions and some behaviors because doing so provides for group solidarity by delineating "outsiders" from "insiders"''.

Falk&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.jbuff.com/gfal.htm |title = Gerhard Falk}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes stigma based on two categories, ''existential stigma'' and ''achieved stigma''. He defines existential stigma as "stigma deriving from a condition which the target of the stigma either did not cause or over which he has little control." He defines ''Achieved Stigma'' as "stigma that is earned because of conduct and/or because they contributed heavily to attaining the stigma in question."&lt;ref name="Falk-2001"/&gt;

Falk concludes that "we and all societies will always stigmatize some condition and some behavior because doing so provides for group solidarity by delineating 'outsiders' from 'insiders'".&lt;ref name="Falk-2001"/&gt; Stigmatization, at its essence, is a challenge to one's humanity- for both the ''stigmatized'' person and the ''stigmatizer''. The majority of stigma researchers have found the process of stigmatization has a long history and is cross-culturally ubiquitous.&lt;ref name="Heatherton-2000"/&gt;

===Link and Phelan stigmatization model===
[[Bruce Link]] and [[Jo Phelan]] propose that stigma exists when four specific components converge:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{citation |author1=Link, Bruce G. |author2=Phelan, Jo C. |year=2001 |title=Conceptualizing Stigma |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |volume=27 |pages=363–85 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.363}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Individuals differentiate and [[labelling|label]] human variations.
# Prevailing cultural beliefs tie those labeled to adverse attributes.
# Labeled individuals are placed in distinguished groups that serve to establish a sense of disconnection between "us" and "them".
# Labeled individuals experience "status loss and [[discrimination]]" that leads to unequal circumstances.

In this model stigmatization is also contingent on "access to [[power (sociology)|social]], [[economic power|economic]], and [[political power]] that allows the identification of differences, construction of [[stereotype]]s, the separation of labeled persons into distinct groups, and the full execution of disapproval, [[social rejection|rejection]], exclusion, and [[discrimination]]." Subsequently, in this model, the term stigma is applied when labeling, stereotyping, disconnection, status loss, and discrimination all exist within a power situation that facilitates stigma to occur.

====Differentiation and labeling====
Identifying which human differences are salient, and therefore worthy of labeling, is a social process. There are two primary factors to examine when considering the extent to which this process is a social one. The first issue is that significant oversimplification is needed to create [[group (sociology)|groups]]. The broad groups of [[black people|black]] and [[white people|white]], [[homosexuality|homosexual]] and [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]], the [[sanity|sane]] and the [[mentally ill]]; and [[youth|young]] and [[old age|old]] are all examples of this. Secondly, the differences that are socially judged to be relevant differ vastly according to time and place. An example of this is the emphasis that was put on the size of the forehead and faces of individuals in the late 19th century—which was believed to be a measure of a person's criminal nature.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====Linking to stereotypes====
The second component of this model centers on the linking of labeled differences with [[stereotype]]s. [[Erving Goffman|Goffman's]] 1963 work made this aspect of stigma prominent and it has remained so ever since. This process of applying certain stereotypes to differentiated groups of individuals has attracted a large amount of attention and [[research]] in recent decades.

====Us and them====
Thirdly, linking negative attributes to groups facilitates separation into "us" and "them". Seeing the labeled group as fundamentally different causes stereotyping with little hesitation. "Us" and "them" implies that the labeled group is slightly less [[human]] in nature and at the extreme not human at all.

====Disadvantage====
The fourth component of stigmatization in this model includes "status loss and [[discrimination]]". Many definitions of stigma do not include this aspect, however, these authors believe that this loss occurs inherently as individuals are "labeled, set apart, and linked to undesirable characteristics." The members of the labeled groups are subsequently disadvantaged in the most common group of [[life chances]] including [[income]], [[education]], [[mental health|mental well-being]], housing status, [[health]], and [[health care|medical treatment]].
Thus, stigmatization by the majorities, the powerful, or the "superior" leads to the [[Othering]] of the minorities, the powerless, and the "inferior".  Whereby the stigmatized individuals become disadvantaged due to the ideology created by "the self," which is the opposing force to "the Other."  As a result, the others become socially excluded and those in power reason the exclusion based on the original characteristics that led to the stigma.&lt;ref&gt;Frosh, Stephen. "The Other." American Imago 59.4 (2002): 389–407. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Necessity of power====
The authors also emphasize&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the role of power ([[power (sociology)|social]], [[economic power|economic]], and [[political power]]) in stigmatization. While the use of power is clear in some situations, in others it can become masked as the power differences are less stark. An extreme example of a situation in which the power role was explicitly clear was the treatment of [[Jewish]] people by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]]. On the other hand, an example of a situation in which individuals of a stigmatized group have "stigma-related processes"{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} occurring would be the inmates of a [[prison]]. It is imaginable that each of the steps described above would occur regarding the inmates' thoughts about the [[corrections officer|guards]]. However, this situation cannot involve true stigmatization, according to this model, because the prisoners do not have the economic, political, or social power to act on these thoughts with any serious discriminatory consequences.

==="Stigma allure" and authenticity===
Sociologist Matthew W. Hughey explains that prior research on stigma has emphasized individual and group attempts to reduce stigma by "passing as normal", by shunning the stigmatized, or through selective disclosure of stigmatized attributes.  Yet, some actors may embrace particular markings of stigma (e.g.: social markings like dishonor or select physical dysfunctions and abnormalities) as signs of moral commitment and/or cultural and political authenticity.  Hence, Hughey argues that some actors do not simply desire to "pass into normal" but may actively pursue a stigmatized identity formation process in order to experience themselves as causal agents in their social environment. Hughey calls this phenomenon "stigma allure".&lt;ref&gt;Hughey, Matthew W. (2012) 'Stigma Allure and White Antiracist Identity Management.' Social Psychology Quarterly. p. 1-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "six dimensions of stigma"===
While often incorrectly attributed to Goffman, the "six dimensions of stigma" were not his invention. They were developed to augment Goffman's two levels – the discredited and the discreditable. Goffman considered individuals whose stigmatizing attributes are not immediately evident. In that case, the individual can encounter two distinct social atmospheres. In the first, he is ''discreditable''—his stigma has yet to be revealed but may be revealed either intentionally by him (in which case he will have some control over how) or by some factor, he cannot control. Of course, it also might be successfully concealed; Goffman called this ''passing''. In this situation, the analysis of stigma is concerned only with the behaviors adopted by the stigmatized individual to manage his identity: the concealing and revealing of information.
In the second atmosphere, he is ''discredited''—his stigma has been revealed and thus it affects not only his behavior but the behavior of others. Jones et al. (1984) added the "six dimensions" and correlate them to Goffman's two types of stigma, discredited and discreditable.

There are six dimensions that match these two types of stigma:&lt;ref name="Jones-1984"&gt;{{citation |vauthors=Jones E, Farina A, Hastorf A, Markus H, Miller D, Scott R |year=1984 |title=Social stigma: The psychology of marked relationships. |place=New York |publisher=Freeman |isbn=978-0716715924}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Concealable – the extent to which others can see the stigma
# Course of the mark – whether the stigma's prominence increases, decreases, or disappears
# Disruptiveness – the degree to which the stigma and/or others' reaction to it impedes social interactions
# [[Aesthetics]] – the subset of others' reactions to the stigma comprising reactions that are positive/approving or negative/disapproving but represent estimations of qualities other than the stigmatized person's inherent worth or dignity
# Origin – whether others think the stigma is present at birth, accidental, or deliberate
# Peril – the danger that others perceive (whether accurately or inaccurately) the stigma to pose to them

===Types===
In ''Unraveling the contexts of stigma'', authors Campbell and Deacon describe Goffman's universal and historical forms of Stigma as the following.
* '''Overt or external deformities''' – such as [[leprosy]], [[clubfoot]], [[cleft lip]] or palate and [[muscular dystrophy]].
* '''Known deviations in personal traits''' – being perceived rightly or wrongly, as weak willed, domineering or having unnatural passions, treacherous or rigid beliefs, and being dishonest, e.g., mental disorders, imprisonment, addiction, homosexuality, unemployment, suicidal attempts and radical political behavior.
* '''Tribal stigma''' – affiliation with a specific [[nationality]], [[religion]], or [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] that constitute a deviation from the normative, e.g. being [[African American]], or being of [[Arab]] descent in the [[United States]] after the [[9/11]] attacks.&lt;ref name="Campbell-Deacon-2006"&gt;{{citation |author1=Catherine Campbell |author2=Harriet Deacon |title=Unraveling the Contexts of Stigma: From Internalisation to Resistance to Change |journal=Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology |date=Sep 2006 |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=411–17 |issn=1052-9284 |doi=10.1002/casp.901 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2787/1/unravellingthecontextsofstigmafrominternalisation.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512081437/http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2787/1/unravellingthecontextsofstigmafrominternalisation.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deviance====
Stigma occurs when an individual is identified as [[deviant]], linked with negative [[stereotype]]s that engender [[prejudice]]d attitudes, which are acted upon in [[discriminatory]] behavior. Goffman illuminated how stigmatized people manage their "Spoiled identity" (meaning the stigma disqualifies the stigmatized individual from full social acceptance) before audiences of normals. He focused on stigma, not as a fixed or inherent attribute of a person, but rather as the experience and meaning of difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Linda Shaw |date=Oct 1991 |title=Stigma and the Moral Careers of Ex-Mental Patients Living in Board and Care |journal=Journal of Contemporary Ethnography |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=285–305 |doi=10.1177/089124191020003003|s2cid=145654722 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerhard Falk expounds upon Goffman's work by redefining ''deviant'' as "others who deviate from the expectations of a group" ''and'' by categorizing deviance into two types:
* '''Societal deviance''' refers to a condition widely perceived, in advance and in general, as being deviant and hence stigma and stigmatized. "Homosexuality is, therefore, an example of societal deviance because there is such a high degree of consensus to the effect that homosexuality is different, and a violation of norms or social expectation".&lt;ref name="Falk-2001"/&gt;
* '''Situational deviance''' refers to a deviant act that is labeled as deviant in a specific situation, and may not be labeled deviant by society. Similarly, a socially deviant action might not be considered deviant in specific situations. "A robber or other street criminal is an excellent example. It is the crime which leads to the stigma and stigmatization of the person so affected."{{full citation needed|date=May 2022}}
* The physically disabled, mentally ill, homosexuals, and a host of others who are labeled ''[[deviant]]'' because they deviate from the expectations of a group, are subject to ''stigmatization -'' the [[social rejection]] of numerous individuals, and often entire groups of people who have been labeled deviant. {{Full citation needed|date=October 2023}}
===Stigma communication===
Communication is involved in creating, maintaining, and diffusing stigmas, and enacting stigmatization.&lt;ref name="Smith-2001"&gt;{{cite book |author=Smith, R. |chapter=Stigma, Communication, and Health |title=Routledge Handbook of Health Communication |edition=2 |pages=455–68 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model of stigma communication explains how and why particular content choices (marks, labels, peril, and responsibility) can create stigmas and encourage their diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith, R. |title=Language of the lost: An explication of stigma communication |journal=Communication Theory |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=462–85 |year=2007 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.2007.00307.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent experiment using health alerts tested the model of stigma communication, finding that content choices indeed predicted stigma beliefs, intentions to further diffuse these messages, and agreement with regulating infected persons' behaviors.&lt;ref name="Smith-2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith, R. |title=An Experimental Test of Stigma Communication Content with a Hypothetical Infectious Disease Alert |journal=Communication Monographs |year=2012 |volume=79 |issue=4 |doi=10.1080/03637751.2012.723811 |pages=522–538|s2cid=143986214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, scholars have highlighted the role of social media channels, such as Facebook and Instagram, in stigma communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Pu |first1=Wenxi |last2=Roth |first2=Philip L. |last3=Thatcher |first3=Jason B. |last4=Nittrouer |first4=Christine L. |last5=Hebl |first5=Mikki |date=2022-06-22 |title=Post‐traumatic stress disorder and hiring: The role of social media disclosures on stigma and hiring assessments of veterans |journal=Personnel Psychology |volume=76 |language=en |pages=41–75 |doi=10.1111/peps.12520 |s2cid=248881528 |issn=0031-5826|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Lauriano |first1=Lucas Amaral |last2=Coacci |first2=Thiago |date=February 2023 |title=Losing Control: The Uncertain Management of Concealable Stigmas When Work and Social Media Collide |url=http://journals.aom.org/doi/full/10.5465/amj.2020.0586 |journal=Academy of Management Journal |language=en |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=222–247 |doi=10.5465/amj.2020.0586 |s2cid=244640965 |issn=0001-4273}}&lt;/ref&gt; These platforms serve as safe spaces for stigmatized individuals to express themselves more freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lucero |first=Leanna |date=2017-04-03 |title=Safe spaces in online places: social media and LGBTQ youth |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/2005615X.2017.1313482 |journal=Multicultural Education Review |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=117–128 |doi=10.1080/2005615X.2017.1313482 |s2cid=151959880 |issn=2005-615X}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, social media can also reinforce and amplify stigmatization, as the stigmatized attributes are amplified and virtually available to anyone indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |title=Self-fulfilling Stigmatization: An Evolutionary Game of Online Opinion Dynamics in Social Movements |url=https://knowledge.uchicago.edu/record/4275 |publisher=University of Chicago |first=Hongding |last=Zhu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Challenging===
Stigma, though powerful and enduring, is not inevitable, and can be challenged. There are two important aspects to challenging stigma: challenging the stigmatization on the part of stigmatizers and challenging the internalized stigma of the stigmatized. To challenge stigmatization, Campbell et al. 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Catherine Campbell |author2=Carol Ann Foulis |author3=Sbongile Maimane |author4=Zweni Sibiya |year=2005 |title=I have an evil child at my house: stigma and HIV/AIDS management in a South African community |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=95 |issue=5 |pages=808–15 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2003.037499|pmid=15855456 |pmc=1449259}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarise three main approaches.
# There are efforts to educate individuals about non-stigmatising facts and why they should not stigmatize.
# There are efforts to legislate against [[discrimination]].
# There are efforts to mobilize the participation of [[community]] members in anti-stigma efforts, to maximize the likelihood that the anti-stigma messages have relevance and effectiveness, according to local contexts.
#
In relation to challenging the internalized stigma of the stigmatized, [[Paulo Freire]]'s theory of [[critical consciousness]] is particularly suitable. Cornish provides an example of how sex workers in [[Sonagachi]], a red light district in India, have effectively challenged internalized stigma by establishing that they are respectable women, who admirably take care of their families, and who deserve rights like any other worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Cornish, F |year=2006 |title=Challenging the stigma of sex work in India: Material context and symbolic change |journal=Journal of Community and Applied Social Psychology |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=462–71 |doi=10.1002/casp.894 |url=https://gcal.academia.edu/FloraCornish/Papers/85187/Challenging-the-stigma-of-sex-work-in-India--Material-context-and-symbolic-change}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study argues that it is not only the force of the rational argument that makes the challenge to the stigma successful, but concrete evidence that sex workers can achieve valued aims, and are respected by others.

Stigmatized groups often harbor cultural tools to respond to stigma and to create a positive self-perception among their members. For example, advertising professionals have been shown to suffer from negative portrayal and low approval rates. However, the advertising industry collectively maintains narratives describing how advertisement is a positive and socially valuable endeavor, and advertising professionals draw on these narratives to respond to stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Andrew C.|last2=Dromi|first2=Shai M.|title=Advertising morality: maintaining moral worth in a stigmatized profession|journal=Theory &amp; Society|volume=47|issue=2|pages=175–206|doi=10.1007/s11186-018-9309-7|year=2018|s2cid=49319915|url=http://osf.io/h6kvu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another effort to mobilize communities exists in the gaming community through organizations like: 
* Take This&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Take This, help for people with mental health challenges who are also passionate about making games |url=http://www.takethis.org/ |access-date= 22 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; – who provides AFK rooms at gaming conventions plus has a Streaming Ambassador Program to reach more than 135,000 viewers each week with positive messages about mental health, and
* NoStigmas&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=NoStigmas, Ally Built, Ally Run, Perpetual Giving, Lead By Example |url=https://nostigmas.org/ |access-date= 22 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; – whose mission "is to ensure that no one faces mental health challenges alone" and envisions "a world without shame or discrimination related to mental health, brain disease, behavioral disorders, trauma, suicide and addiction" plus offers workplaces a NoStigmas Ally course and individual certifications.
* [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] streamers like {{citation |title= MommaFoxFire |url=https://www.twitch.tv/mommafoxfire}} place emphasis on mental health awareness to help lessen the stigma around talking about mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=MommaFoxFire – Live-streaming research-driven, relate-able conversations in a peer-supported, non-judgemental environment |url=https://www.twitch.tv/mommafoxfire |access-date= 22 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organizational stigma ===
In 2008, an article by Hudson coined the term "organizational stigma"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hudson|first=Bryant Ashley|date=2008-01-01|title=Against all Odds: A Consideration of Core-Stigmatized Organizations|url=https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amr.2008.27752775|journal=Academy of Management Review|volume=33|issue=1|pages=252–266|doi=10.5465/amr.2008.27752775|issn=0363-7425}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was then further developed by another theory building article by Devers and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Devers|first1=Cynthia E.|last2=Dewett|first2=Todd|last3=Mishina|first3=Yuri|last4=Belsito|first4=Carrie A.|date=2008-08-20|title=A General Theory of Organizational Stigma|url=https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/orsc.1080.0367|journal=Organization Science|volume=20|issue=1|pages=154–171|doi=10.1287/orsc.1080.0367|s2cid=15800515|issn=1047-7039|hdl=10044/1/15611|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; This literature brought the concept of stigma to the organizational level, considering how organizations might be considered as deeply flawed and cast away by audiences in the same way individuals would. Hudson differentiated core-stigma (a stigma related to the very nature of the organization) and event-stigma (an isolated occurrence which fades away with  time). A large literature has debated how organizational stigma relate to other constructs in the literature on social evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=mishina devers 2012 – Google Search|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=mishina+devers+2012|access-date=2020-08-28|website=www.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2020 book by [[Thomas J. Roulet|Roulet]] reviews this literature and disentangle the different concepts{{snd}} in particular differentiating stigma, dirty work, scandals{{snd}} and exploring their positive implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Roulet|first=Thomas J.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9781503613904|title=The Power of Being Divisive|date=2020-11-23|publisher=Stanford University Press|doi=10.1515/9781503613904|isbn=978-1-5036-1390-4|s2cid=229042417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current research==
The research was undertaken to determine the effects of social stigma primarily focuses on disease-associated stigmas. Disabilities, psychiatric disorders, and sexually transmitted diseases are among the diseases currently scrutinized by researchers. In studies involving such diseases, both positive and negative effects of social stigma have been discovered.{{clarify|date=August 2015}}

===Stigma in healthcare settings===
Recent research suggest that addressing perceived and enacted stigma in clinical settings is critical to ensuring delivery of high-quality patient-centered care. Specifically, perceived stigma by patients was associated with additional more days of poor physical or mental health. Moreover, perceived stigma in healthcare settings was associated with higher odds of reporting a depressive disorder. Among other findings, individuals who were married, younger, had higher income, had college degrees, and were employed reported significantly fewer poor physical and mental health days and had lower odds of self-reported depressive disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Budhwani |first1=Henna |last2=De |first2=Prabal |title=Perceived Stigma in Health Care Settings and the Physical and Mental Health of People of Color in the United States |journal=Health Equity |date=2019 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=73–80 |doi=10.1089/heq.2018.0079 |pmid=30915422 |pmc=6434589 |issn=2473-1242}}&lt;/ref&gt; A complementary study conducted in New York City (as compared to nationwide), found similar outcomes. The researchers' objectives were to assess rates of perceived stigma in health care (clinical) settings reported by racially diverse New York City residents and to examine if this perceived stigma is associated with poorer physical and mental health outcomes. They found that perceived stigma was associated with poorer healthcare access, depression, diabetes, and poor overall general health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=De |first1=Prabal |last2=Pozen |first2=Alexis |last3=Budhwani |first3=Henna |title=Is Perceived Stigma in Clinical Settings Associated With Poor Health Status Among New York City's Residents of Color? |journal=Medical Care |date=December 2019 |volume=57 |issue=12 |pages=960–967 |doi=10.1097/MLR.0000000000001205 |pmid=31730568 |pmc=6859955 |issn=1537-1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research on self-esteem===
{{Main|Self-esteem}}
Members of stigmatized groups may have lower [[self-esteem]] than those of nonstigmatized groups. A test could not be taken on the overall self-esteem of different races. Researchers would have to take into account whether these people are optimistic or pessimistic, whether they are male or female and what kind of place they grew up in.
Over the last two decades, many studies have reported that African Americans show higher global self-esteem than whites even though, as a group, African Americans tend to receive poorer outcomes in many areas of life and experience significant discrimination and stigma.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Mental disorders===
{{Further|Mental disorder#Stigma}}
[[Empirical research]] on the stigma associated with mental disorders, pointed to a surprising attitude of the general public. Those who were told that mental disorders had a genetic basis were more prone to increase their [[social distance]] from the mentally ill, and also to assume that the ill were dangerous individuals, in contrast with those members of the general public who were told that the illnesses could be explained by social and environmental factors. Furthermore, those informed of the genetic basis were also more likely to stigmatize the entire family of the ill.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ben Goldacre]], ''[http://www.badscience.net/2010/10/pride-and-prejudice/ The stigma gene]'', reproduced on his blog from his column in [[The Guardian]], 9 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Although the specific social categories that become stigmatized can vary over time and place, the three basic forms of stigma (physical deformity, poor personal traits, and tribal outgroup status) are found in most cultures and eras, leading some researchers to hypothesize that the tendency to stigmatize may have evolutionary roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FRszpOfV5o0C&amp;pg=PA113|title=Weight Bias|year=2005|isbn=9781593851996|last1=Brownell|first1=Kelly D|publisher=Guilford Publications }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |vauthors=Kurzban R, Leary MR |year=2001 |title=Evolutionary Origins of Stigmatization: The Functions of Social Exclusion |journal=[[Psychological Bulletin]] |volume=127 |issue=2 |pages=187–208 |pmid=11316010 |url=http://www2.uni-jena.de/svw/igc/studies/ss04/Kurzban_Leary_2001_PB.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716085409/http://www2.uni-jena.de/svw/igc/studies/ss04/Kurzban_Leary_2001_PB.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 July 2011 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.127.2.187}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of the stigma is significant, leading many individuals to not seek out treatment. For example, evidence from a refugee camp in Jordan suggests that providing mental health care comes with a dilemma: between the clinical desire to make mental health issues visible and actionable through datafication and the need to keep mental health issues hidden and out of the view of the community to avoid stigma. That is, in spite of their suffering the refugees were hesitant to receive mental health care as they worried about stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Christensen |first1=Lars Rune |last2=Ahsan |first2=Hasib |date=2023-09-07 |title=The Trouble of Stigma in the Age of Datafication: Screening for Mental Health Issues in a Refugee Camp in Jordan |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01459740.2023.2250060 |journal=Medical Anthropology |volume=42 |issue=7 |language=en |pages=623–636 |doi=10.1080/01459740.2023.2250060 |pmid=37676028 |s2cid=261580747 |issn=0145-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, several researchers believe that mental disorders are caused by a [[Chemical imbalance|chemical imbalance in the brain.]] Therefore, this biological rationale suggests that individuals struggling with a mental illness do not have control over the origin of the disorder. Much like [[cancer]] or another type of physical disorder, persons suffering from mental disorders should be supported and encouraged to seek help. The [[Disability Rights Movement]] recognises that while there is considerable stigma towards people with [[Physical disorder|physical disabilities]], the negative social stigma surrounding mental illness is significantly worse, with those suffering being perceived to have control of their disabilities and being responsible for causing them. "Furthermore, research respondents are less likely to pity persons with mental illness, instead of reacting to the psychiatric disability with anger and believing that help is not deserved."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Understanding the impact of stigma on people with mental illness|journal = World Psychiatry|date = 1 February 2002|issn = 1723-8617|pmc = 1489832|pmid = 16946807|pages = 16–20|volume = 1|issue = 1|first1 = PATRICK W|last1 = CORRIGAN|first2 = AMY C|last2 = WATSON}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are effective mental health interventions available across the globe, many persons with mental illnesses do not seek out the help that they need. Only 59.6% of individuals with a mental illness, including conditions such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, reported receiving treatment in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/mental-illness-stigma.html | title=The Impact of Mental Illness Stigma on Seeking and Participating in Mental Health Care}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing the negative stigma surrounding mental disorders may increase the probability of affected individuals seeking professional help from a [[psychiatrist]] or a non-psychiatric [[physician]].

====Causes====
Arikan found that a [[stigmatization of mental illness|stigmatising attitude to psychiatric patients]] is associated with [[narcissistic]] personality traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arikan, K. |title=A stigmatizating attitude towards psychiatric illnesses is associated with narcissistic personality traits |journal=Isr J Psychiatry Relat Sci |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=248–50 |year=2005 |url=http://www.kemalarikan.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/arikan_stigma_narsisizm.pdf |pmid=16618057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Taiwan]], strengthening the psychiatric rehabilitation system has been one of the primary goals of the Department of Health since 1985. This endeavor has not been successful. It was hypothesized that one of the barriers was social stigma towards the mentally ill.&lt;ref name="Song-Chang-Shih-Lin-Yang-2005"&gt;{{citation |vauthors=Song LY, Chang LY, Shih CY, Lin CY, Yang MJ |year=2005 |title=Community Attitudes Towards the Mentally Ill: The Results of a National Survey of the Taiwanese Population |journal=International Journal of Social Psychiatry |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=162–76 |pmid=16048245 |doi=10.1177/0020764005056765|s2cid=5885211 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, a study was conducted to explore the attitudes of the general population towards patients with mental disorders. A survey method was utilized on 1,203 subjects nationally. The results revealed that the general population held high levels of benevolence, tolerance on rehabilitation in the community, and nonsocial restrictiveness.&lt;ref name="Song-Chang-Shih-Lin-Yang-2005"/&gt; Essentially, benevolent attitudes were favoring the acceptance of rehabilitation in the community. It could then be inferred that the belief (held by the residents of Taiwan) in treating the mentally ill with high regard, and the progress of psychiatric rehabilitation may be hindered by factors other than social stigma.&lt;ref name="Song-Chang-Shih-Lin-Yang-2005"/&gt;

====Artists====
In the music industry, specifically in the genre of hip-hop or rap, those who speak out on mental illness are heavily criticized. However, according to an article by [[The Huffington Post]], there's a significant increase in rappers who are breaking their silence on depression and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/5-influential-rappers-that-broke-the-mental-health_us_57896a66e4b0e7c873500ec7 |title=5 Influential Rappers That Broke The Mental Health Stigma |last=Florez |first=Jose |date=27 July 2016 |work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the drug methamphetamine has been strongly stigmatized. An Australian national population study have shown that the proportion of Australians who nominated methamphetamine as a "drug problem" increased between 2001–2019.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Chan |first1=Gary C.

=== Poverty ===
Recipients of public assistance programs are often scorned as unwilling to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jarrett|first=Robin L.|date=1996|title=Welfare Stigma among Low-Income, African American Single Mothers|journal=Family Relations|volume=45|issue=4|pages=368–374|doi=10.2307/585165|issn=0197-6664|jstor=585165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intensity of poverty stigma is positively correlated with increasing inequality.&lt;ref name="Offer&amp;Pinker"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Policy and Welfare Pluralism|date=18 October 2017|publisher=Policy Press|isbn=9781447323556|editor-last=Offer|editor-first=John|editor-last2=Pinker|editor-first2=Robert|doi = 10.1332/policypress/9781447323556.001.0001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As inequality increases, societal propensity to stigmatize increases.&lt;ref name="Offer&amp;Pinker" /&gt; This is in part, a result of societal norms of [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]] which is the expectation that people earn what they receive rather than receiving assistance in the form of what people tend to view as a gift.&lt;ref name="Offer&amp;Pinker" /&gt; Poverty is often perceived as a result of failures and poor choices rather than the result of socioeconomic structures that suppress individual abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Association|first=American Psychological|date=20 January 2010|title=Resolution on poverty and socioeconomic status|journal=Roeper Review|volume=25|issue=3|pages=103–105|language=en|doi=10.1080/02783190309554209|s2cid=219712150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disdain for the impoverished can be traced back to its roots in [[Anglo-Americans|Anglo-American]] culture where poor people have been blamed and ostracized for their misfortune for hundreds of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Phelan|first1=Jo|last2=Link|first2=Bruce G.|last3=Moore|first3=Robert E.|last4=Stueve|first4=Ann|date=1997|title=The Stigma of Homelessness: The Impact of the Label "Homeless" on Attitudes Toward Poor Persons|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|volume=60|issue=4|pages=323–337|doi=10.2307/2787093|issn=0190-2725|jstor=2787093}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of deviance is at the bed rock of stigma towards the poor.  Deviants are people that break important norms of society that everyone shares.  In the case of poverty it is breaking the norm of reciprocity that paves the path for stigmatization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Public assistance ===
Social stigma is prevalent towards recipients of public assistance programs.  This includes programs frequently utilized by families struggling with poverty such as [[Head Start (program)|Head Start]] and [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children|AFDC]] (Aid To Families With Dependent Children).  The value of self-reliance is often at the center of feelings of shame and the fewer people value self reliance the less stigma affects them psychologically.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2021-11-05 |title=How Long-Term Unemployment May Mess with Your Mental Health |url=https://psychcentral.com/health/mental-health-effects-of-long-term-unemployment |access-date=2023-10-24 |website=Psych Central |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stigma towards welfare recipients has been proven to increase passivity and dependency in poor people and has further solidified their status and feelings of inferiority.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogers-Dillon|first=Robin|date=1 December 1995|title=The dynamics of welfare stigma|journal=Qualitative Sociology|language=en|volume=18|issue=4|pages=439–456|doi=10.1007/BF02404490|s2cid=144636532|issn=1573-7837}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Drasch |first=Katrin |date=2019 |title=The social stigma of unemployment: consequences of stigma consciousness on job search attitudes, behaviour and success |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334431470}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caseworkers frequently treat recipients of welfare disrespectfully and make assumptions about deviant behavior and reluctance to work.  Many single mothers cited stigma as the primary reason they wanted to exit welfare as quickly as possible.  They often feel the need to conceal food stamps to escape judgement associated with welfare programs.  Stigma is a major factor contributing to the duration and breadth of poverty in developed societies which largely affects single mothers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Recipients of public assistance are viewed as objects of the community rather than members allowing for them to be perceived as enemies of the community which is how stigma enters collective thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Liane V.|last2=Hagen|first2=Jan L.|date=26 July 2016|title=Stereotypes and Stigma: What's Changed for Welfare Mothers|journal=Affilia|volume=11|issue=3|pages=319–337|language=en|doi=10.1177/088610999601100304|s2cid=144933839}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst single mothers in poverty, lack of health care benefits is one of their greatest challenges in terms of exiting poverty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Traditional values of self reliance increase feelings of shame amongst welfare recipients making them more susceptible to being stigmatized.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Epilepsy===
====Hong Kong====
[[Epilepsy]], a common [[neurological disorder]] characterized by recurring [[seizure]]s, is associated with various social stigmas. Chung-yan Guardian Fong and Anchor Hung conducted a study in Hong Kong which documented public attitudes towards individuals with epilepsy. Of the 1,128 subjects interviewed, only 72.5% of them considered epilepsy to be acceptable;{{clarify|date=February 2012}} 11.2% would not let their children play with others with epilepsy; 32.2% would not allow their children to marry persons with epilepsy; additionally, some employers (22.5% of them) would terminate an employment contract after an epileptic seizure occurred in an employee with unreported epilepsy.&lt;ref name="Fong-Hung-2002"&gt;{{citation |author1=Fong, C. |author2=Hung, A. |year=2002 |title=Public Awareness, Attitude, and Understanding of Epilepsy in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China |journal=Epilepsia |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=311–16 |doi=10.1046/j.1528-1157.2002.31901.x|pmid=11906517 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suggestions were made that more effort be made to improve public awareness of, attitude toward, and understanding of epilepsy through school education and epilepsy-related organizations.&lt;ref name="Fong-Hung-2002"/&gt;

===Media===
In the early 21st century, technology has a large impact on the lives of people in multiple countries and has shaped social norms. Many people own a television, computer, and a smartphone. The media can be helpful with keeping people up to date on news and world issues and it is very influential on people. Because it is so influential sometimes the portrayal of minority groups affects attitudes of other groups toward them. Much media coverage has to do with other parts of the world. A lot of this coverage has to do with war and conflict, which people may relate to any person belonging from that country. There is a tendency to focus more on the positive behavior of one's own group and the negative behaviors of other groups. This promotes negative thoughts of people belonging to those other groups, reinforcing stereotypical beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Geschke, D. |author2=Sassenberg, K. |author3=Fuhrmann, G. |author4=Sommer, D. |year=2010 |title=Effects of linguistic abstractness in the mass media: How newspaper articles shape readers' attitudes toward migrants |journal=Journal of Media Psychology: Theories, Methods, and Applications |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=99–104 |doi=10.1027/1864-1105/a000014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Viewers seem to react to violence with emotions such as anger and contempt.  They are concerned about the integrity of the social order and show disapproval of others. Emotions such as sadness and fear are shown much more rarely." (Unz, Schwab &amp; Winterhoff-Spurk, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;141)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Unz, D., Schwab, F., Winterhoff-Spurk, P. |year=2008 |title=TV news–the daily horror?: Emotional effects of violent television news |journal=Journal of Media Psychology: Theories, Methods, and Applications |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=141–55 |doi=10.1027/1864-1105.20.4.141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study testing the effects of stereotypical advertisements on students, 75 high school students viewed magazine advertisements with stereotypical female images such as a woman working on a holiday dinner, while 50 others viewed nonstereotypical images such as a woman working in a law office.  These groups then responded to statements about women in a "neutral" photograph.  In this photo, a woman was shown in a casual outfit not doing any obvious task.  The students that saw the stereotypical images tended to answer the questionnaires with more stereotypical responses in 6 of the 12 questionnaire statements.  This suggests that even brief exposure to stereotypical ads reinforces stereotypes. (Lafky, Duffy, Steinmaus &amp; Berkowitz, 1996)&lt;ref&gt;Lafky et al. "Looking through Gendered Lenses: Female Stereotyping in Advertisements and Gender Role Expectations" in ''Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly'', v73 n2 p379-88 Sum 1996. http://virtualworker.pbworks.com/f/Looking%20through....pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and culture===
The aforementioned stigmas (associated with their respective diseases) propose effects that these stereotypes have on individuals. Whether effects be negative or positive in nature, 'labeling' people causes a significant change in individual perception (of persons with the disease). Perhaps a mutual understanding of stigma, achieved through education, could eliminate social stigma entirely.

Laurence J. Coleman first adapted [[Erving Goffman]]'s (1963) social stigma theory to gifted children, providing a rationale for why children may hide their abilities and present alternate identities to their peers.&lt;ref name="Coleman, Laurence J. 1985"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Coleman, Laurence J. |year=1985 |title=Schooling the Gifted |publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coleman, L.

Coleman and [[Tracy L. Cross]] in their book entitled, ''Being Gifted in School'', which is a widely cited reference in the field of gifted education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=being+gifted+in+school+&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C47 |title=Google Scholar Search |access-date=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the chapter on Coping with Giftedness, the authors expanded on the theory first presented in a 1988 article.&lt;ref name="Is being gifted a social handicap"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coleman |first1=L.J. |last2=Cross |first2=T. L. |title=Is being gifted a social handicap? |journal=Journal for the Education of the Gifted |volume=11 |issue=4 |year=1988 |pages=41–56|doi=10.1177/016235328801100406 |s2cid=210811281 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Google Scholar, this article has been cited over 300 times in the academic literature (as of 2022).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=472226131980923114 |title=Google Scholar Search |access-date=11 May 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleman and [[Tracy L. Cross|Cross]] were the first to identify intellectual giftedness as a stigmatizing condition and they created a model based on Goffman's (1963) work, research with gifted students,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and a book that was written and edited by 20 teenage, gifted individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=The American Association of Gifted Children |year=1978 |title=On Being Gifted |url=https://archive.org/details/onbeinggifted00gres |url-access=registration |publisher=Walker, and Company|isbn=9780802706164 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Being gifted sets students apart from their peers and this difference interferes with full social acceptance. Varying expectations that exist in the different social contexts which children must navigate, and the value judgments that may be assigned to the child result in the child's use of social coping strategies to manage his or her identity. Unlike other stigmatizing conditions, giftedness is unique because it can lead to praise or ridicule depending on the audience and circumstances.

Gifted children learn when it is safe to display their giftedness and when they should hide it to better fit in with a group. These observations led to the development of the Information Management Model that describes the process by which children decide to employ coping strategies to manage their identities. In situations where the child feels different, she or he may decide to manage the information that others know about him or her. Coping strategies include disidentification with giftedness, attempting to maintain low visibility, or creating a high-visibility identity (playing a stereotypical role associated with giftedness).

While abortion is very common throughout the world, people may choose not to disclose their use of such services, in part due to the stigma associated with having had an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hanschmidt|first1=Franz|last2=Linde|first2=Katja|last3=Hilbert|first3=Anja|last4=Riedel- Heller|first4=Steffi G.|last5=Kersting|first5=Anette|date=December 2016|title=Abortion Stigma: A Systematic Review: Abortion stigma – A systematic review|journal=Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health|volume=48|issue=4|pages=169–177|doi=10.1363/48e8516|pmid=27037848|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cowan|first=Sarah K.|date=March 2017|title=Enacted abortion stigma in the United States|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=177|pages=259–268|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.01.011|pmid=28161123|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keeping abortion experiences secret has been found to be associated with increased isolation and psychological distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hanschmidt|first1=Franz|last2=Linde|first2=Katja|last3=Hilbert|first3=Anja|last4=Riedel-Heller|first4=Steffi G.|last5=Kersting|first5=Anette|date=December 2016|title=Abortion Stigma: A Systematic Review|journal=Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health|volume=48|issue=4|pages=169–177|doi=10.1363/48e8516|issn=1931-2393|pmid=27037848|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortion providers are also subject to stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harris|first1=Lisa|title=Second Trimester Abortion Provision: Breaking the Silence and Changing the Discourse|journal=Reproductive Health Matters|date=2008|volume=16|issue=31|pages=74–81|doi=10.1016/S0968-8080(08)31396-2|pmid=18772087|s2cid=24915723|url=http://lib.tcu.edu/staff/bellinger/abortion/Harris.pdf|access-date=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=O'Donnell, Jenny|author2=Weitz, Tracy|author3=Freedman, Lori|title=Resistance and vulnerability to stigmatization in abortion work|journal=Social Science and Medicine|date=November 2011|volume=73|issue=9|pages=1357–1364|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.08.019|pmid=21940082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stigmatization of prejudice===
Cultural norms can prevent displays of prejudice as such views are stigmatized and thus people will express non-prejudiced views even if they believe otherwise ([[preference falsification]]). However, if the stigma against such views is lessened, people will be more willing to express prejudicial sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/14/16143582/charlottesville-prejudice-psychology "The scientific case that America is becoming more prejudiced"] [[Vox (website)|Vox]], 14 August 2017, retrieved 25 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; For example, following the 2008 economic crisis, anti-immigration sentiment seemingly increased amongst the US population when in reality the level of sentiment remained the same and instead it simply became more acceptable to openly express opposition to immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Creighton|first1=Matthew|last2=Jamal|first2=Amaney|last3=Malancu|first3=Natalia|date=3 May 2014|title=Has Opposition to Immigration Increased in the United States after the Economic Crisis? An experimental Approach|journal=International Migration Review|volume=49|issue=3|pages=727–756|doi=10.1111/imre.12091|s2cid=153811626}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Spatial Stigma===
Spatial stigma refers to stigmas that are linked to ones geographic location. This can be applied to neighborhoods, towns, cities or any defined geographical space. A person's geographic location or place of origin can be a source of stigma. &lt;ref&gt; Halliday E, Popay J, Anderson de Cuevas R, Wheeler P. The elephant in the room? Why spatial stigma does not receive the public health attention it deserves. J Public Health (Oxf). 2020 Feb 28;42(1):38–43. doi: 10.1093/pubmed/fdy214. PMID: 30576532.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of stigma can leade to negative health outcomes.
