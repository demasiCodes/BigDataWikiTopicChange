Gender dysphoria in those [[assigned male at birth]] (AMAB) tends to follow one of two broad trajectories: early-onset or late-onset. [[Gender dysphoria in children|Early-onset gender dysphoria]] is behaviorally visible in childhood but may temporarily subside, leading the person to identify as [[gay]] or [[homosexual]] for a period of time, followed by recurrence of gender dysphoria. A 2016 review in the [[Archives of Sexual Behavior]] states this group is usually sexually attracted to members of their natal sex in adulthood, commonly identifying as [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]]. Late-onset gender dysphoria does not include visible signs in early childhood, but some report having had wishes to be the opposite sex in childhood that they did not report to others.&lt;ref name="Guillamon"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Guillamon A, Junque C, Gómez-Gil E |title=A Review of the Status of Brain Structure Research in Transsexualism |journal=[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]] |volume=45 |issue=7 |pages=1615–1648 |date = October 2016 |pmid=27255307 |pmc=4987404 |doi=10.1007/s10508-016-0768-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, according to the review, transgender people assigned male at birth who experience late-onset gender dysphoria will usually be attracted to women and may identify as lesbians or bisexual, while those with early-onset will usually be [[Androphilia and gynephilia|attracted to men]].&lt;ref name="Guillamon" /&gt; The review states a similar pattern occurs in those [[assigned female at birth]] (AFAB), with those experiencing early-onset GD being most likely to be attracted to women and those with late-onset being most likely to be attracted to men and identify as gay.&lt;ref name="Guillamon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dsm5"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse/page/451 |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Publishing]] |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-89042-554-1 |edition=Fifth |location=Arlington, VA |pages=[https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse/page/451 451–460]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--NOTE: entire paragraph is sourced to refs at end of paragraph--&gt;

== Diagnosis ==

=== DSM-5 ===
The [[American Psychiatric Association]] permits a diagnosis of ''gender dysphoria'' in adolescents or adults if two or more of the following criteria are experienced for at least six months' duration:&lt;ref name="DSM5" /&gt;
&lt;!--Note that these are paraphrased from the original to avoid copyright violation.--&gt;
* A significant incongruence between one's experienced or expressed gender and one's [[sexual characteristics]]
* A strong desire to be rid of one's sexual characteristics due to incongruence with one's experienced or expressed gender
* A strong desire for the sexual characteristics of a gender other than one's assigned gender
* A strong desire to be of a gender other than one's assigned gender
* A strong desire to be treated as a gender other than one's assigned gender
* A strong conviction that one has the typical reactions and feelings of a gender other than one's assigned gender
In addition, the condition must be associated with clinically significant distress or impairment.&lt;ref name="DSM5" /&gt;

The DSM-5 moved this diagnosis out of the sexual disorders category and into a category of its own.&lt;ref name="DSM5" /&gt; The diagnosis was renamed from gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria, after criticisms that the former term was stigmatizing.&lt;ref name="DSMVChild"&gt;{{cite web |date=May 4, 2011 |title=Gender Dysphoria in Children |url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevision/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=192 |access-date=July 3, 2011 |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |archive-date=March 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314204820/http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevision/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=192 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subtyping by sexual orientation was deleted. The diagnosis for children was separated from that for adults, as "[[gender dysphoria in children]]".

=== ICD-11 ===
The [[International Classification of Diseases]] ([[ICD-11]]) lists three conditions&lt;!--They are defined as "conditions" by the ICD, not "diseases" or "disorders".--&gt; related to gender identity:&lt;ref name="icd11-gc"&gt;{{cite web |title=Gender incongruence (ICD-11) |url=https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/411470068 |access-date=August 28, 2018 |website=icd.who.int |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |archive-date=August 1, 2018 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20180801205234/https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en%23/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/294762853#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/411470068 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gender incongruence of adolescence or adulthood ({{ICD11|HA60|90875286}})
* Gender incongruence of childhood ({{ICD11|HA61|344733949}})
* Gender incongruence, unspecified ({{ICD11|HA6Z}})

ICD-11 defines gender incongruence as "a marked and persistent incongruence between an individual's experienced gender and the assigned sex", with no requirement for significant distress or impairment.&lt;ref name="icd11-gc"/&gt;

== Treatment ==
Treatment for a person diagnosed with GD may include psychological counseling, supporting the individual's [[gender expression]], or may involve physical transition resulting from medical interventions such as hormonal treatment, genital surgery, electrolysis, laser hair removal, chest surgery, breast surgery or other reconstructive surgeries.&lt;ref name="NHS"&gt;{{cite web |year=2016 |title=NHS - Treatment - Gender dysphoria |url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gender-dysphoria/treatment/ |access-date=January 10, 2019 |publisher=[[NHS]] |archive-date=November 2, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102135038/http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Gender-dysphoria/Pages/Treatment.aspx |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of treatment may simply be to reduce problems resulting from the person's transgender status, for example, counseling the patient in order to reduce guilt associated with cross-dressing.&lt;ref name="Leiblum-2006"&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Leiblum S |title=Principles and Practice of Sex Therapy, Fourth Edition |publisher=[[Guilford Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-59385-349-5 |pages=488–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[American Psychiatric Association]], "Due to the dynamic nature of puberty development, lack of gender-affirming interventions (i.e. social, psychological, and medical) is not a neutral decision; youth often experience worsening dysphoria and negative impact on mental health as the incongruent and unwanted puberty progresses. Trans-affirming treatment, such as the use of puberty suppression, is associated with the relief of emotional distress, and notable gains in psychosocial and emotional development, in trans and gender diverse youth".&lt;ref name="APA-Position"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/About-APA/Organization-Documents-Policies/Policies/Position-Transgender-Gender-Diverse-Youth.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201207160233/https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/About-APA/Organization-Documents-Policies/Policies/Position-Transgender-Gender-Diverse-Youth.pdf |archive-date=December 7, 2020 |url-status=live |title=Position Statement on Treatment of Transgender (Trans) and Gender Diverse Youth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its position statement published December 2020, the [[Endocrine Society]] stated that there is durable evidence for a biological underpinning to gender identity and that pubertal suppression, hormone therapy, and medically indicated surgery are effective and relatively safe when monitored appropriately and have been established as the standard of care. They noted a decrease in suicidal ideation among youth who have access to gender-affirming care and comparable levels of depression to cisgender peers among socially transitioned pre-pubertal youth.&lt;ref name="endocrine-society-2020"&gt;{{Cite web |date=December 15, 2020 |title=Transgender Health: An Endocrine Society Position Statement |url=https://www.endocrine.org/advocacy/position-statements/transgender-health |access-date=June 15, 2022 |website=www.endocrine.org |publisher=The Endocrine Society |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201225153455/https://www.endocrine.org/advocacy/position-statements/transgender-health |archive-date=December 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 2017 guideline on treating those with gender dysphoria, it recommends puberty blockers be started when the child has started puberty ([[Tanner scale|Tanner Stage 2]] for breast or genital development) and cross-sex hormones be started at 16, though they note "there may be compelling reasons to initiate sex hormone treatment prior to the age of 16 years in some adolescents with GD/gender incongruence". They recommend a multidisciplinary team of medical and mental health professionals manage the treatment for those under 18 and recommend "monitoring clinical pubertal development every 3 to 6 months and laboratory parameters every 6 to 12 months during sex hormone treatment".&lt;ref name="Hembree"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hembree WC, Cohen-Kettenis PT, Gooren L, Hannema SE, Meyer WJ, Murad MH, Rosenthal SM, Safer JD, Tangpricha V, T'Sjoen GG |display-authors=6 |title=Endocrine Treatment of Gender-Dysphoric/Gender-Incongruent Persons: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline |journal=[[The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism]] |volume=102 |issue=11 |pages=3869–3903 |date=November 2017 |pmid=28945902 |doi=10.1210/jc.2017-01658 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Professional Association for Transgender Health]]'s Standards of Care 8, published in 2022, declare puberty blocking medication as "medically necessary", and recommends them for usage in transgender adolescents once the patient has reached Tanner stage 2 of development, and state that longitudinal data shows improved outcomes for transgender patients who receive them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Coleman E, Radix AE, Bouman WP, Brown GR, de Vries AL, Deutsch MB, Ettner R, Fraser L, Goodman M, Green J, Hancock AB, Johnson TW, Karasic DH, Knudson GA, Leibowitz SF, Meyer-Bahlburg HF, Monstrey SJ, Motmans J, Nahata L, Nieder TO, Reisner SL, Richards C, Schechter LS, Tangpricha V, Tishelman AC, Van Trotsenburg MA, Winter S, Ducheny K, Adams NJ, Adrián TM, Allen LR, Azul D, Bagga H, Başar K, Bathory DS, Belinky JJ, Berg DR, Berli JU, Bluebond-Langner RO, Bouman MB, Bowers ML, Brassard PJ, Byrne J, Capitán L, Cargill CJ, Carswell JM, Chang SC, Chelvakumar G, Corneil T, Dalke KB, De Cuypere G, de Vries E, Den Heijer M, Devor AH, Dhejne C, D'Marco A, Edmiston EK, Edwards-Leeper L, Ehrbar R, Ehrensaft D, Eisfeld J, Elaut E, Erickson-Schroth L, Feldman JL, Fisher AD, Garcia MM, Gijs L, Green SE, Hall BP, Hardy TL, Irwig MS, Jacobs LA, Janssen AC, Johnson K, Klink DT, Kreukels BP, Kuper LE, Kvach EJ, Malouf MA, Massey R, Mazur T, McLachlan C, Morrison SD, Mosser SW, Neira PM, Nygren U, Oates JM, Obedin-Maliver J, Pagkalos G, Patton J, Phanuphak N, Rachlin K, Reed T, Rider GN, Ristori J, Robbins-Cherry S, Roberts SA, Rodriguez-Wallberg KA, Rosenthal SM, Sabir K, Safer JD, Scheim AI, Seal LJ, Sehoole TJ, Spencer K, St Amand C, Steensma TD, Strang JF, Taylor GB, Tilleman K, T'Sjoen GG, Vala LN, Van Mello NM, Veale JF, Vencill JA, Vincent B, Wesp LM, West MA, Arcelus J |display-authors=6 |title=Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People, Version 8 |journal=[[International Journal of Transgender Health]] |volume=23 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S1–S259 |year=2022 |pmid=36238954 |pmc=9553112 |doi=10.1080/26895269.2022.2100644}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some medical professionals disagree that adolescents are cognitively mature enough to make a decision with regard to hormone therapy or surgery, and advise that irreversible genital procedures should not be performed on individuals under the age of legal consent in their respective country.&lt;ref name="Maddux2"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eOlzCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA464 |title=Psychopathology: Foundations for a Contemporary Understanding |vauthors=Maddux JE, Winstead BA |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2015 |isbn=978-1317697992 |pages=464–465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological treatments ===
{{Main|Psychotherapy}}

The DSM-5 gives a gender dysphoria prevalence of 0.005% to 0.014% of people assigned male at birth (5-14 per 100k) and 0.002% to 0.003% of people assigned female at birth (2-3 per 100k).&lt;ref name="dsm5_454"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse/page/454 |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-89042-555-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse/page/454 454]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DSM-5 states that these numbers are likely underestimates, being based on the number of referrals to specialty clinics.&lt;ref name="dsm5_454"/&gt; Not all adults seeking medical transition are referred to specialty clinics.&lt;ref name="dsm5_454"/&gt;

According to ''[[Black's Medical Dictionary]]'', gender dysphoria "occurs in one in 30,000 male births and one in 100,000 female births."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Gender Identity Disorders |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6asrDwAAQBAJ |editor=Harvey Marcovitch |encyclopedia=[[Black's Medical Dictionary]] |edition=43rd |location=New York |publisher=Bloomsbury |year=2018 |isbn=9781472943064 |access-date=2021-01-14 |archive-date=2022-06-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220609011002/https://www.google.com/books/edition/Black_s_Medical_Dictionary/6asrDwAAQBAJ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in European countries in the early 2000s found that about 1 in 12,000 natal male adults (8 per 100k) and 1 in 30,000 (3 per 100k) natal female adults seek out [[gender-affirming surgery]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zucker KJ | title = Epidemiology of gender dysphoria and transgender identity | journal = Sexual Health | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 404–411 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28838353 | doi = 10.1071/SH17067 | s2cid = 205237976 | url = http://www.publish.csiro.au/?paper=SH17067 | access-date = 2020-12-22 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220609011008/https://www.publish.csiro.au/sh/SH17067 | archive-date = 2022-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of hormonal treatment or legal [[name change]] find higher prevalence than sex reassignment, with, for example a 2010 Swedish study finding that 1 in 7,750 (13 per 100k) adult natal males and 1 in 13,120 (8 per 100k) adult natal females requested a legal name change to a name of the opposite gender.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Studies that measure transgender status by self-identification find even greater prevalence of gender identity different from sex assigned at birth (although some of those who identify as transgender or gender nonconforming may not experience clinically significant distress and so do not have gender dysphoria).

== History ==
Neither the [[DSM-I]] (1952) nor the [[DSM-II]] (1968) contained a diagnosis analogous to gender dysphoria. Gender identity disorder first appeared as a diagnosis in the [[DSM-III]] (1980), where it appeared under "psychosexual disorders" but was used only for the childhood diagnosis. Adolescents and adults received a diagnosis of transsexualism (homosexual, heterosexual, or asexual type). The DSM-III-R (1987) added "Gender Identity Disorder of Adolescence and Adulthood, Non-Transsexual Type" (GIDAANT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Koh J |title=[The history of the concept of gender identity disorder] |journal=Seishin Shinkeigaku Zasshi = Psychiatria et Neurologia Japonica |volume=114 |issue=6 |pages=673–680 |year=2012 | pmid = 22844818 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Pauly IB |year=1993 |title=Terminology and Classification of Gender Identity Disorders |journal=[[Journal of Psychology &amp; Human Sexuality]] |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=1–14 |doi=10.1300/J056v05n04_01 |s2cid=142954603}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, Jack, [[doi:10.1080/19359701003589637|Transsexualism, Gender Identity Disorder and the DSM]], ''[[Journal of Gay &amp; Lesbian Mental Health]]'' 14, no. 2 (2010): 112.&lt;/ref&gt; [[DSM-5|DSM-V]] (2013) replaced gender identity disorder (GID) with gender dysphoria (GD) to avoid the stigma of the term ''disorder''.&lt;ref name="DSM-5 fact sheet" /&gt;

== Society and culture ==
[[File:2013 Rally for Transgender Equality 21175.jpg|right|thumb|A sign at a trans rights rally: "Gender is like that old jumper from my cousin: It was given to me and it doesn't fit."]]
Researchers disagree about the nature of distress and impairment in people with GD. Some authors have suggested that people with GD suffer because they are [[social stigma|stigmatized]] and [[victimisation|victimized]];&lt;ref name="Karl Bryant"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Bryant KE |title=The Politics of Pathology and the Making of Gender Identity Disorder |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-549-26816-1 |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan |page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that, if society had less strict gender divisions, transgender people would suffer less.&lt;ref name="Giordano-2012"&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Giordano S |title=Children with Gender Identity Disorder: A Clinical, Ethical, and Legal Analysis |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-415-50271-9 |location=New Jersey |page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some controversy surrounds the creation of the GD diagnosis, with Davy et al. stating that although the creators of the diagnosis state that it has rigorous scientific support, "it is impossible to scrutinize such claims, since the discussions, methodological processes, and promised field trials of the diagnosis have not been published."&lt;ref name="Davy"/&gt;

Some cultures have [[Third gender|three or more defined genders]]. The existence of accepted social categories other than man or woman may alleviate the distress associated with cross-gender identity. For example, in [[Samoa]], the ''[[fa'afafine]]'', a group of [[feminine males]], are mostly socially accepted. The fa'afafine appear similar to transgender women in terms of their lifelong identities and gendered behavior, but experience far less distress than do transgender women in Western cultures. This suggests that the distress of gender dysphoria is significantly increased by difficulties encountered from social disapproval by one's culture.&lt;ref name="fa'afafine"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vasey PL, Bartlett NH |title=What can the Samoan "Fa'afafine" teach us about the Western concept of gender identity disorder in childhood? |journal=[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine]] |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=481–490 |year=2007 |pmid=17951883 |doi=10.1353/pbm.2007.0056 |s2cid=37437172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, it is unclear whether or not gender dysphoria persists in cultures with third gender categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse/page/459 |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-89042-555-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse/page/457 457]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classification as a disorder ===
The [[mental disorder|psychiatric diagnosis]] of gender identity disorder (now gender dysphoria) was introduced in DSM-III in 1980. [[Arlene Istar Lev]] and [[Deborah Rudacille]] have characterized the addition as a political maneuver to re-stigmatize homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Lev AI |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwxvazLRmiEC&amp;q=homosexuality+dsm-iii+transsexuality&amp;pg=PA172 |title=Transgender Emergence: Therapeutic Guidelines for Working with Gender-Variant People and Their Families |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-7890-2117-5 |page=172 |author-link=Arlene Istar Lev |access-date=November 11, 2020 |archive-date=January 23, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210123073430/https://books.google.com/books?id=LwxvazLRmiEC&amp;q=homosexuality+dsm-iii+transsexuality&amp;pg=PA172|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Rudacille D |title=The Riddle of Gender: Science, Activism, and Transgender Rights |date=February 2005 |publisher=Pantheon |isbn=978-0-375-42162-4 |author-link=Deborah Rudacille}}{{page needed|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Homosexuality was [[Homosexuality in the DSM|declassified as a mental disorder]] in the DSM-II in 1974.)

Individuals with gender dysphoria may or may not regard their own cross-gender feelings and behaviors as a disorder. Advantages and disadvantages exist to classifying gender dysphoria as a disorder.&lt;ref name="Standards of Care" /&gt; Because gender dysphoria had been classified as a disorder in medical texts (such as the previous DSM manual, the DSM-IV-TR, under the name "gender identity disorder"), many insurance companies are willing to cover some of the expenses of sex reassignment therapy.

An analysis of the Samoan third gender ''fa'afafine'' suggests that the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic component of distress is not inherent in the cross-gender identity; rather, it is related to social rejection and discrimination suffered by the individual.&lt;ref name="fa'afafine" /&gt; Psychology professor Darryl Hill insists that gender dysphoria is not a mental disorder, but rather that the diagnostic criteria reflect psychological distress in children that occurs when parents and others have trouble relating to their child's gender variance.&lt;ref name="PsychNews" /&gt; Transgender people have often been harassed, socially excluded, and subjected to discrimination, abuse and violence, including murder.&lt;ref name="Davidson-2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Giordano-2012" /&gt;

The term ''gender euphoria'' has been used by the transgender community since at least the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Originally, it referred to the feeling of joy arising from fulfilling a mix of [[gender role]]s, which was different from the concept of gender dysphoria, which is used to describe individuals who wished to medically transition to a different sex.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In the 1980s, the term was published in trans contexts, coming up in interviews with trans people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Aman R |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwrqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22gender+euphoria%22 |title=Maledicta |date=1986 |publisher=Maledicta Press |isbn=978-0-916500-29-0 |language=en |access-date=2022-06-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220602003726/https://books.google.com/books?id=iwrqAAAAMAAJ&amp;newbks=0&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22gender+euphoria%22&amp;q=%22gender+euphoria%22&amp;hl=en |archive-date=2022-06-02 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Aman R |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=J2n5iLgdClkC&amp;q=%22gender+euphoria%22 |title=Lillian Mermin Feinsilver Festschrift |date=1988 |publisher=Maledicta Press |isbn=978-0-916500-29-0 |language=en |access-date=2022-06-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220602003729/https://books.google.com/books?id=J2n5iLgdClkC&amp;newbks=0&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22gender+euphoria%22&amp;q=%22gender+euphoria%22&amp;hl=en |archive-date=2022-06-02 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nhLaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22gender+euphoria%22 |title=Transsexualism: A Collection of Articles, Editorials, and Letters on the Subject of Male-to-female and Female-to-male Transsexualism Edited from the TV-TS Tapestry Journal, Issues 39-52 |date=1988 |publisher=International Foundation for Gender Education |language=en |access-date=2022-06-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220602003725/https://books.google.com/books?id=nhLaAAAAMAAJ&amp;newbks=0&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22gender+euphoria%22&amp;q=%22gender+euphoria%22&amp;hl=en |archive-date=2022-06-02 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in a 1988 interview with a [[trans man]], the subject states, "I think that day [Dr. Charles Ilhenfeld] administered my first shot of the 'wonder-drug' must have been one of the 'peak-experiences' of my life -- talk about 'gender euphoria'!"&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nhLaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22gender+euphoria%22 |title=Transsexualism: A Collection of Articles, Editorials, and Letters on the Subject of Male-to-female and Female-to-male Transsexualism Edited from the TV-TS Tapestry Journal, Issues 39-52 |date=1988 |publisher=International Foundation for Gender Education |location=University of Michigan |language=en |access-date=2022-06-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220602003725/https://books.google.com/books?id=nhLaAAAAMAAJ&amp;newbks=0&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22gender+euphoria%22&amp;q=%22gender+euphoria%22&amp;hl=en |archive-date=2022-06-02 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interview indicates he is referring to [[testosterone]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

"Factors that drive mental health disparities and promote well-being in transgender and nonbinary people".

Gender euphoria has also been expressed through art.
