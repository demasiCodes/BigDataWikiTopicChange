'''Gender dysphoria''' ('''GD''') is the distress a person feels due to a mismatch between their [[gender identity]] and their [[sex assignment|sex assigned at birth]]. People with gender dysphoria are typically [[transgender]]. The diagnostic label '''gender identity disorder''' ('''GID''')&lt;!--NOTE: Per WP:Alternative title, the term should be bolded somewhere in the lead.--&gt; was used until 2013 with the release of the [[DSM-5]]. The condition was renamed to remove the [[Stigmatization|stigma]] associated with the term ''disorder''.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association, [https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM-5-Gender-Dysphoria.pdf DSM-5 Fact Sheets, Updated Disorders: Gender Dysphoria] (Washington, D.C.: American Psychiatric Association, 2013): 2 ("DSM-5 aims to avoid stigma and ensure clinical care for individuals who see and feel themselves to be a different gender than their assigned gender. It replaces the diagnostic name 'gender identity disorder' with 'gender dysphoria', as well as makes other important clarifications in the criteria.").&lt;/ref&gt;

Distress arising from an incongruence between a person's felt gender and assigned sex/gender (usually at birth) is the cardinal symptom of gender dysphoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zucker|first1=Kenneth J.|last2=Lawrence|first2=Anne A.|last3=Kreukels|first3=Baudewijntje P.C.|year=2016|title=Gender Dysphoria in Adults|journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology|volume=12|pages=217–247|doi=10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-021815-093034|pmid=26788901|quote=[For DSM-5] a reconceptualization was articulated in which 'identity' per se was not considered a sign of a mental disorder.

Gender dysphoria in those [[assigned male at birth]] tends to follow one of two broad trajectories: early-onset or late-onset. Early-onset gender dysphoria is behaviorally visible in childhood. Sometimes gender dysphoria will desist in this group and they will identify as gay or homosexual for a period of time, followed by recurrence of gender dysphoria. This group is usually sexually attracted to members of their natal sex in adulthood. Late-onset gender dysphoria does not include visible signs in early childhood, but some report having had wishes to be the opposite sex in childhood that they did not report to others. Trans women who experience late-onset gender dysphoria will usually be sexually attracted to women and may identify as lesbians. It is common for people assigned male at birth who have late-onset gender dysphoria to engage in [[Transvestic fetishism|cross-dressing with sexual excitement]]. In those [[assigned female at birth]], early-onset gender dysphoria is the most common course. This group is usually sexually attracted to women. Trans men who experience late-onset gender dysphoria will usually be sexually attracted to men and may identify as gay.&lt;ref name="dsm5"&gt;{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse/page/451|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-0-89042-554-1|edition=Fifth|location=Arlington, VA|pages=[https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse/page/451 451–460]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guillamon"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Guillamon A, Junque C, Gómez-Gil E|date=October 2016|title=A Review of the Status of Brain Structure Research in Transsexualism|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=45|issue=7|pages=1615–48|doi=10.1007/s10508-016-0768-5|pmc=4987404|pmid=27255307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In adolescents and adults, symptoms include the desire to be and to be treated as the other gender.&lt;ref name = DSM5/&gt; Adults with GD are at increased risk for stress, isolation, anxiety, depression, [[low self-esteem|poor self-esteem]], and suicide.&lt;ref name="Davidson-2012" /&gt; Studies indicate that transgender people have an extremely high rate of suicide attempts; one study of 6,450 transgender people in the United States found 41% had attempted [[suicide]], compared to a national average of 1.6%.

== Causes ==
{{Main|Causes of transsexuality}}
A twin study (based on seven people in a 314 sample) suggested that GD may be 62% heritable, indicating the possibility of a genetic influence as its origin, in these cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Coolidge FL, Thede LL, Young SE|date=July 2002|title=The heritability of gender identity disorder in a child and adolescent twin sample|journal=Behavior Genetics|volume=32|issue=4|pages=251–7|doi=10.1023/A:1019724712983|pmid=12211624|s2cid=25159803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
The [[American Psychiatric Association]] permits a diagnosis of ''gender dysphoria'' in adolescents or adults if two or more of the following criteria are experienced for at least six months' duration:&lt;ref name="DSM5" /&gt;
&lt;!--Note that these are paraphrased from the original to avoid copyright violation.--&gt;
* A strong desire to be of a gender other than one's assigned gender
* A strong desire to be treated as a gender other than one's assigned gender
* A significant incongruence between one's experienced or expressed gender and one's [[sexual characteristics]]
* A strong desire for the sexual characteristics of a gender other than one's assigned gender
* A strong desire to be rid of one's sexual characteristics due to incongruence with one's experienced or expressed gender
* A strong conviction that one has the typical reactions and feelings of a gender other than one's assigned gender
In addition, the condition must be associated with clinically significant distress or impairment.&lt;ref name="DSM5" /&gt;

The DSM-5 moved this diagnosis out of the sexual disorders category and into a category of its own.&lt;ref name="DSM5" /&gt; The diagnosis was renamed from gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria, after criticisms that the former term was stigmatizing.&lt;ref name="DSMVChild"&gt;{{cite web|date=May 4, 2011|title=Gender Dysphoria in Children|url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevision/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=192#|access-date=July 3, 2011|publisher=American Psychiatric Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subtyping by sexual orientation was deleted. The diagnosis for children was separated from that for adults, as "[[gender dysphoria in children]]". The creation of a specific diagnosis for children reflects the lesser ability of children to have insight into what they are experiencing, or ability to express it in the event that they have insight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=P 00 Gender Dysphoria in Children|url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevision/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=192#|access-date=April 2, 2012|publisher=American Psychiatric Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Other specified gender dysphoria'' or ''unspecified gender dysphoria'' can be diagnosed if a person does not meet the criteria for gender dysphoria but still has clinically significant distress or impairment.&lt;ref name="DSM5" /&gt; Intersex people are now included in the diagnosis of GD.&lt;ref name="Davy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davy|first1=Zowie|last2=Toze|first2=Michael|year=2018|title=What Is Gender Dysphoria?

The [[International Classification of Diseases]] ([[ICD-10]]) lists several disorders related to gender identity:&lt;ref name="ICD-10"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Classification of Diseases (ICD) F64 Gender identity disorders|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2016/en#/F60-F69|access-date=August 9, 2018|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Potts|first1=S|last2=Bhugra|first2=D|year=1995|title=Classification of sexual disorders|journal=[[International Review of Psychiatry]]|volume=7|issue=2|pages=167–174|doi=10.3109/09540269509028323}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Transsexual]]ism (F64.0): Desire to live and be accepted as a member of the opposite sex, usually accompanied by a desire for surgery and hormonal treatment
* [[Gender dysphoria in children|Gender identity disorder of childhood]] (F64.2): Persistent and intense distress about one's assigned gender, manifested prior to puberty
* Other gender identity disorders (F64.8)
* Gender identity disorder, unspecified (F64.9)
* [[Sexual maturation disorder]] (F66.0): Uncertainty about one's gender identity or sexual orientation, causing anxiety or distress

The [[ICD-11]], which will come into effect on 1 January 2022, significantly revises classification of gender identity-related conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Classification of Diseases|url=https://www.who.int/health-topics/international-classification-of-diseases|access-date=August 11, 2018|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under "conditions related to sexual health", the ICD-11 lists "gender incongruence", which is coded into three conditions:&lt;ref name="icd11-gc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender incongruence (ICD-11)|url=https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/411470068|access-date=August 28, 2018|website=icd.who.int|publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Gender incongruence of adolescence or adulthood (HA60): replaces F64.0
* Gender incongruence of childhood (HA61): replaces F64.2
* Gender incongruence, unspecified (HA6Z): replaces F64.9

In addition, sexual maturation disorder has been removed, along with [[dual-role transvestism]].&lt;ref name="pmid27717275"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Reed GM, Drescher J, Krueger RB, Atalla E, Cochran SD, First MB, Cohen-Kettenis PT, Arango-de Montis I, Parish SJ, Cottler S, Briken P, Saxena S|date=October 2016|title=Disorders related to sexuality and gender identity in the ICD-11: revising the ICD-10 classification based on current scientific evidence, best clinical practices, and human rights considerations|journal=World Psychiatry|volume=15|issue=3|pages=205–221|doi=10.1002/wps.20354|pmc=5032510|pmid=27717275}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICD-11 defines gender incongruence as "a marked and persistent incongruence between an individual’s experienced gender and the assigned sex", with presentations similar to the DSM-5 definition, but does not require significant distress or impairment.

== Management ==
Treatment for a person diagnosed with GD may include psychotherapy or to support the individual's preferred gender through [[Sex reassignment therapy|hormone therapy]], gender expression and role, or surgery. This may include psychological counseling, resulting in lifestyle changes, or physical changes, resulting from medical interventions such as hormonal treatment, genital surgery, electrolysis or laser hair removal, chest/breast surgery, or other reconstructive surgeries.&lt;ref name="NHS"&gt;{{cite web|year=2016|title=NHS - Treatment - Gender dysphoria|url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gender-dysphoria/treatment/|access-date=January 10, 2019|publisher=NHS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of treatment may simply be to reduce problems resulting from the person's transgender status, for example, counseling the patient in order to reduce guilt associated with cross-dressing, or counseling a spouse to help them adjust to the patient's situation.&lt;ref name="Leiblum-2006"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Leiblum|first=Sandra|title=Principles and Practice of Sex Therapy, Fourth Edition|publisher=The Guilford Press|year=2006|isbn=978-1-59385-349-5|pages=488–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guidelines have been established to aid clinicians. The [[World Professional Association for Transgender Health]] (WPATH) [[Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People|Standards of Care]] are used by some clinicians as treatment guidelines.

The question of whether to counsel young children to be happy with their assigned sex, or to encourage them to continue to exhibit behaviors that do not match their assigned sex—or to explore a transgender transition—is controversial.  The follow-up studies of children with gender dysphoria consistently show that the majority cease to feel transgender during puberty and identify instead as gay or lesbian.&lt;ref&gt;Wallien, M. S.

Professionals who treat gender dysphoria in children have begun to refer and prescribe hormones, known as [[puberty blocker]]s, to delay the onset of puberty until a child is believed to be old enough to make an informed decision on whether hormonal gender reassignment leading to surgical gender reassignment will be in that person's best interest.&lt;ref&gt;''The Transgendered Child: A Handbook for Families and Professionals'' (Brill and Pepper, 2008){{full citation needed|date=May 2016}}{{page needed|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1970s, psychotherapy was the primary treatment for gender dysphoria and generally was directed to helping the person adjust to the gender of the physical characteristics present at birth. Psychotherapy is any therapeutic interaction that aims to treat a psychological problem. Though some clinicians still use only psychotherapy to treat gender dysphoria, it may now be used in addition to biological interventions.&lt;ref name="treatment review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gijs|first1=L|last2=Brawaeys|first2=A|year=2007|title=Surgical Treatment of Gender Dysphoria in Adults and Adolescents: Recent Developments, Effectiveness, and Challenges|journal=Annual Review of Sex Research|volume=18|issue=178–224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychotherapeutic treatment of GD involves helping the patient to adapt. Attempts to alleviate GD by changing the patient's gender identity to reflect birth characteristics have been ineffective.&lt;ref name="merck manual"&gt;{{cite book|author=George R.

=== Biological treatments ===
{{Main|Sex reassignment therapy}}
Biological treatments physically alter [[Primary sex characteristic|primary]] and [[Secondary sex characteristic|secondary]] sex characteristics to reduce the discrepancy between an individual's physical body and gender identity.&lt;ref name="care guidelines"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bockting|first1=W|last2=Knudson|first2=G|last3=Goldberg|first3=J|date=January 2006|title=Counselling and Mental Health Care of Transgender Adults and Loved Ones}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biological treatments for GD without any form of psychotherapy is quite uncommon. Researchers have found that if individuals bypass psychotherapy in their GD treatment, they often feel lost and confused when their biological treatments are complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hakeem|first=Az|year=2008|title=Changing Sex or Changing Minds: Specialist Psychotherapy and Transsexuality|journal=Group Analysis|volume=41|issue=2|pages=182–196|doi=10.1177/0533316408089883|s2cid=143359476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychotherapy, hormone replacement therapy, and [[sex reassignment surgery]] together can be effective treating GD when the [[HBIGDA-SOC|WPATH standards of care]] are followed.&lt;ref name="merck manual" /&gt;{{rp|1570}} The overall level of patient satisfaction with both psychological and biological treatments is very high.&lt;ref name="treatment review" /&gt;

In April 2011, the UK National Research Ethics Service approved prescribing monthly injection of puberty-blocking drugs to youngsters from 12 years old, in order to enable them to get older before deciding on formal sex change. The [[Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust]] (T&amp;P) in North London has treated such children.  Clinic director Dr. Polly Carmichael said, "Certainly, of the children between 12 and 14, there's a number who are keen to take part. I know what's been very hard for their families is knowing that there's something available but it's not available here." The clinic received 127 referrals for gender dysphoria in 2010.&lt;ref name="dt15"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8454002/Puberty-blocker-for-children-considering-sex-change.html telegraph.co.uk: "Puberty blocker for children considering sex change"], ''The Daily Telegraph'' (Alleyne) April 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The T&amp;P completed a three-year trial to assess the psychological, social and physical benefits and risks involved for 12- to 14-year-old patients.  The trial was deemed such a success that doctors have decided to make the drugs more widely available and to children as young as 9 years of age.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} As recently as 2009, national guidelines stated that treatment for gender dysphoria should not start until puberty had finished.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} [[Ferring Pharmaceuticals]] manufactures the drug Triptorelin, marketed under the name [[Gonapeptyl]], at £82 per monthly dose. The treatment is reversible, which means the body will resume its previous state upon discontinuation of drugs.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

== History ==
Neither the [[DSM-I]] (1952) nor the [[DSM-II]] (1968) contained a diagnosis analogous to gender dysphoria. Gender identity disorder first appeared as a diagnosis in the [[DSM-III]] (1980), where it appeared under "psychosexual disorders" but was used only for the childhood diagnosis. Adolescents and adults received a diagnosis of transsexualism (homosexual, heterosexual, or asexual type). The DSM-III-R (1987) added "Gender Identity Disorder of Adolescence and Adulthood, Non-Transsexual Type" (GIDAANT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Koh J|year=2012|title=[The history of the concept of gender identity disorder]|journal=Seishin Shinkeigaku Zasshi = Psychiatria et Neurologia Japonica|volume=114|issue=6|pages=673–80|pmid=22844818}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pauly|first1=Ira B.|year=1993|title=Terminology and Classification of Gender Identity Disorders|journal=Journal of Psychology &amp; Human Sexuality|volume=5|issue=4|pages=1–14|doi=10.1300/J056v05n04_01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, Jack, [[doi:10.1080/19359701003589637|Transsexualism, Gender Identity Disorder and the DSM]], ''Journal of Gay &amp; Lesbian Mental Health'' 14, no. 2 (2010): 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Society and culture ==
[[File:2013 Rally for Transgender Equality 21175.jpg|right|thumb|A sign at a trans rights rally: "Gender is like that old jumper from my cousin: It was given to me and it doesn't fit."]]
Researchers disagree about the nature of distress and impairment in people with GD. Some authors have suggested that people with GD suffer because they are [[social stigma|stigmatized]] and [[victimisation|victimized]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bryant|first=Karl Edward|title=The Politics of Pathology and the Making of Gender Identity Disorder|year=2007|isbn=978-0-549-26816-1|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that, if society had less strict gender divisions, transsexual people would suffer less.&lt;ref name="Giordano-2012"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Giordano|first=Simona|title=Children with Gender Identity Disorder: A Clinical, Ethical, and Legal Analysis|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0-415-50271-9|location=New Jersey|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some controversy surrounds the creation of the GD diagnosis, with Davy et al. stating that although the creators of the diagnosis state that it has rigorous scientific support, "it is impossible to scrutinize such claims, since the discussions, methodological processes, and promised field trials of the diagnosis have not been published."&lt;ref name="Davy"/&gt;

=== Gender as a social construction ===
{{Main|Social construction of gender}}
Social gender characteristics are created and supported by the expectations of a culture and are therefore only partially related to biological sex. For example, the association of particular colors with "girl" or "boy" babies begins extremely early in Western European-derived cultures. Other expectations relate to approved and allowable behaviors and emotional expression.&lt;ref name="Marecek, Crawford &amp; Popp"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marecek, J.|title=The Psychology of Gender|author2=Crawford, M.|author3=Popp, D.|publisher=Guilford Press|year=2004|editor1=A.H. Eagly|location=New York|pages=192–216|chapter=On the Construction of Gender, Sex, and Sexualities|editor2=A.E. Beall|editor3=R.J. Sternberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cultures have [[Third gender|three defined genders]]: man, woman, and effeminate man. For example, in [[Samoa]], the ''[[fa'afafine]]'', a group of feminine males, are entirely socially accepted. The fa'afafine do not have any of the stigma or distress typically associated in most cultures with deviating from a male/female gender role. This suggests the distress so frequently associated with GID in a Western context is not ''caused'' by the disorder itself, but by difficulties encountered from social disapproval by one's culture.&lt;ref name="fa'afafine"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Vasey PL, Bartlett NH|year=2007|title=What can the Samoan "Fa'afafine" teach us about the Western concept of gender identity disorder in childhood?|journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|volume=50|issue=4|pages=481–90|doi=10.1353/pbm.2007.0056|pmid=17951883|s2cid=37437172}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research has found that the anxiety associated with gender dysphoria persists in cultures, Eastern or otherwise, which are more accepting of gender nonconformity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse/page/459|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5|publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|year=2013|isbn=978-0-89042-555-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse/page/459 459]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, a 2014 High Court of Australia judgment unanimously ruled in favor of a plaintiff named [[Norrie May-Welby|Norrie]], who asked to be classified by a third gender category, 'non-specific', after a long court battle with the NSW Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages.&lt;ref name="Norrie"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|11|2014|litigants=NSW Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages v Norrie|courtname=auto|date=April 2, 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Court did not accept that gender was a social construction: it found that sex reassignment "surgery did not resolve her sexual ambiguity".&lt;ref name="Norrie" /&gt;{{rp|para 11}}

=== Classification as a disorder ===
The [[mental disorder|psychiatric diagnoses]] of gender identity disorder (now gender dysphoria) was introduced in DSM-III in 1980. [[Arlene Istar Lev]] and [[Deborah Rudacille]] have characterized the addition as a political maneuver to re-stigmatize homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lev|first=Arlene Istar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwxvazLRmiEC&amp;q=homosexuality+dsm-iii+transsexuality&amp;pg=PA172|title=Transgender Emergence: Therapeutic Guidelines for Working with Gender-Variant People and Their Families|publisher=Haworth Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7890-2117-5|page=172|authorlink=Arlene Istar Lev}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudacille|first=Deborah|title=The Riddle of Gender: Science, Activism, and Transgender Rights|date=February 2005|publisher=Pantheon|isbn=978-0-375-42162-4|authorlink=Deborah Rudacille}}{{page needed|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Homosexuality was removed from DSM-II in 1974.) By contrast, [[Kenneth Zucker]] and [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]] argue that gender identity disorder was included in DSM-III because it "met the generally accepted criteria used by the framers of DSM-III for inclusion."&lt;ref name="Historical Note"&gt;{{citation|last1=Zucker|first1=KJ|title=Was the gender identity disorder of childhood diagnosis introduced into DSM-III as a backdoor maneuver to replace homosexuality?

Fink, contend that the behaviors and experiences seen in transsexualism are abnormal and constitute a dysfunction.&lt;ref name="PsychNews"&gt;{{cite news|title=Controversy Continues to Grow Over DSM's GID Diagnosis|publisher=Psychiatric News|url=http://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/newsarticle.aspx?articleid=106462}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Psychiatric Association stated that [[gender nonconformity]] is not the same thing as gender dysphoria,&lt;ref name="What Is"/&gt; and that "gender nonconformity is not in itself a mental disorder. The critical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated with the condition."&lt;ref name="DSM-5 fact sheet"/&gt;

Individuals with gender dysphoria may or may not regard their own cross-gender feelings and behaviors as a disorder. Advantages and disadvantages exist to classifying gender dysphoria as a disorder.&lt;ref name="Standards of Care" /&gt; Because gender dysphoria had been classified as a disorder in medical texts (such as the previous DSM manual, the DSM-IV-TR, under the name "gender identity disorder"), many insurance companies are willing to cover some of the expenses of sex reassignment therapy. Without the classification of gender dysphoria as a medical disorder, sex reassignment therapy may be viewed as a cosmetic treatment, rather than medically necessary treatment, and may not be covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ford|first=Zack|title=APA Revises Manual: Being Transgender is No Longer a Mental Disorder|url=http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2012/12/03/1271431/apa-revises-manual-being-transgender-is-no-longer-a-mental-disorder/?mobile=nc|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202082602/http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2012/12/03/1271431/apa-revises-manual-being-transgender-is-no-longer-a-mental-disorder/?mobile=nc|archive-date=February 2, 2013|access-date=April 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, transgender people are less likely than others to have health insurance, and often face hostility and insensitivity from healthcare providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mallon|first=Gerald P.|title=Social Work Practice with Transgender and Gender Variant Youth|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=978-0-415-99482-8|location=New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSM-IV-TR diagnostic component of distress is not inherent in the cross-gender identity; rather, it is related to social rejection and discrimination suffered by the individual.&lt;ref name="fa'afafine" /&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Psychology professor Darryl Hill insists that gender dysphoria is not a mental disorder, but rather that the diagnostic criteria reflect psychological distress in children that occurs when parents and others have trouble relating to their child's gender variance.&lt;ref name="PsychNews" /&gt; Transgender people have often been harassed, socially excluded, and subjected to discrimination, abuse and violence, including murder.&lt;ref name="Davidson-2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Giordano-2012" /&gt;

In December 2002, the British Lord Chancellor's office published a ''Government Policy Concerning Transsexual People'' document that categorically states, "What transsexualism is not ... It is not a mental illness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2003|title=Government Policy concerning Transsexual People|url=http://www.dca.gov.uk/constitution/transsex/policy.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511211217/http://www.dca.gov.uk/constitution/transsex/policy.htm|archive-date=May 11, 2008|work=People's rights/Transsexual people|publisher=U.K. Department for Constitutional Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, the government of France declared that a transsexual gender identity will no longer be classified as a psychiatric condition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=May 16, 2009|title=La transsexualité ne sera plus classée comme affectation psychiatrique|work=Le Monde|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2009/05/16/la-transsexualite-ne-sera-plus-classee-comme-affectation-psychiatrique_1193860_3224.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; but according to French trans rights organizations, beyond the impact of the announcement itself, nothing changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=May 17, 2011|title=La France est très en retard dans la prise en charge des transsexuels|language=fr|work=Libération|url=http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2011/05/17/la-france-est-tres-en-retard-dans-la-prise-en-charge-des-transsexuels_736344|quote=En réalité, ce décret n'a été rien d'autre qu'un coup médiatique, un très bel effet d'annonce.

In the ICD-11, GID is reclassified as "gender incongruence", a condition related to sexual health.&lt;ref name="icd11-gc" /&gt; The working group responsible for this recategorization recommended keeping such a diagnosis in ICD-11 to preserve access to health services.&lt;ref name=pmid27717275 /&gt;
