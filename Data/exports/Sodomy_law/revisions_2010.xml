A '''sodomy law''' is a [[law]] that defines certain [[sexual acts]] as [[Sex and the law|crimes]]. The precise sexual acts meant by the term [[sodomy]] are rarely spelled out in the law, but are typically understood by courts to include any sexual act deemed ''unnatural''.  It also has a range of similar [[euphemism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Weeks | first = Jeff | title =Sex, Politics and Society: The Regulation of Sexuality Since 1800 | publisher = Longman Publishing Group |month=January | year=1981 | location = London | isbn = 0-582-48334-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These acts typically include [[oral sex]], [[anal sex]] and [[zoophilia|bestiality]]; in practice such laws have rarely been enforced against heterosexual couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tnr.com/article/unnatural-law| title=Unnatural Law |last=Sullivan |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Sullivan |date=2003-03-24 |work=The New Republic |accessdate=2009-11-27 |quote=Since the laws had rarely been enforced against heterosexuals, there was no sense of urgency about their repeal.}} (Or {{cite journal |last=Sullivan |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Sullivan|title=Unnatural Law |journal=The New Republic |volume=228 |issue=11 |date=2003-03-24}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Such laws have roots in antiquity, and are linked to religious proscriptions against certain sex acts. Contemporary supporters of sodomy laws argue that there are additional reasons for retaining them.

Sodomy laws can be found around the world. Today, consensual homosexual acts between adults are illegal in about 70 out of the 195 countries of the world; in 40 of these, only male-male sex is outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilga.info/Information/Legal_survey/summary_information_by_subject.htm ILGA World Legal Survey] (Last updated: 31 July 2000, accessed 19 April 2006); updates from [[Homosexuality laws of the world]].&lt;/ref&gt; This number has been in a progressive state of decline since the second half of the [[20th century]].

== History ==
{{unencyclopedic|date=November 2010}}
The Middle [[Assyria]]n Law Codes (1075 BC) state: If a man have intercourse with his brother-in-arms, they shall turn him into a [[eunuch]]. This is the earliest known law condemning the act of male to male intercourse in the military.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/1075assyriancode.html The Code of the Assura, c. 1075 BCE]&lt;/ref&gt;
The '''[[Lex Scantinia]]''' was written by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].  It includes laws restricting homosexual acts, but not banning the behavior.  Utilizing male slaves as homosexual sex objects was not outlawed as long as the slave was on the receiving end.

Most anti-sodomy laws in Western countries originated from a Christian world-view established from the Bible.   The New Testament has been said to condemn Sodomy; {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In [[England]], [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] introduced the first legislation under English criminal law against sodomy with the [[Buggery Act of 1533]], making [[buggery]] punishable by [[hanging]], a penalty not lifted until 1861.

Following Sir [[William Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch15.htm|work=Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England|title=Book the Fourth – Chapter the Fifteenth: Of Offences Against the Persons of Individuals|accessdate=2006-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the crime of sodomy has often been defined only as the ''abominable and detestable crime against nature'', or some variation of the phrase.  This language led to widely varying rulings about what specific acts were encompassed by its prohibition.

After the publishing of the [[Wolfenden report]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], which asserted that "homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence", many western governments, including the [[United States]], have repealed laws specifically against homosexual acts. In June 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' that [[U.S. state|state]] laws criminalizing private, non-commercial sexual activity between consenting adults at home on the grounds of morality are unconstitutional since there is insufficient justification for intruding into people's liberty and privacy.

All of [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Latin America]] and [[South America]] have recently abolished sodomy laws (except for; [[Belize]], [[Guyana]] and along with several [[Caribbean islands]]; including [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Barbados]], [[Dominica]], [[Grenada]], [[Jamaica]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]). This trend among Western nations has not been followed in all other regions of the world (Africa, some parts of Asia, Oceania and the Caribbean Islands), where sodomy often remains a serious crime. Homosexual acts remain punishable by death in [[Iran]], [[Mauritania]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Sudan]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Yemen]], some parts of [[Nigeria]] and [[Somalia]]. Prison for life in : [[Barbados]] (Not enforced for acts in private – under review) [[Bangladesh]], [[Guyana]], [[Maldives]], [[Myanmar]]/[[Burma]], [[Pakistan]], [[Qatar]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Uganda]].

In Asia, there have never been Western-style Sodomy laws in [[People's Republic of China]], [[Taiwan]], [[North Korea]], [[South Korea]], or [[Vietnam]]; whilst Sodomy laws have been repealed in [[Japan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[The Philippines]], [[Thailand]], and [[India]]. Other  discriminatory measures may exist against homosexuals in these countries.

== Sodomy laws by country ==
=== Australia ===
{{Main|LGBT rights in Australia}}

[[Australia]] inherited the [[United Kingdom]]'s sodomy laws on colonisation in 1788.  These were retained in the criminal codes passed by the various colonial [[parliament]]s during the 19th century, and by the state parliaments after [[Federation]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Following the [[Wolfenden report]], the [[Don Dunstan|Dunstan]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government introduced a ''consenting adults in private'' type legal defence in [[South Australia]] in 1972. This defence was initiated as a bill by Murray Hill, father of former [[Defence Minister]] [[Robert Hill (Australian politician)|Robert Hill]], and repealed the state's sodomy law in 1975.  The [[Campaign Against Moral Persecution]] during the 1970s raised the profile and acceptance of Australia's gay and lesbian communities, and other states and territories repealed their laws between 1976 and 1990. The exception was [[Tasmania]], which retained its laws until the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]] and the [[United Nations]] [[Human Rights Committee]] forced their repeal in 1997.  The details are given in the book ''Living out Loud: A History of Gay and Lesbian Activism in Australia''. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
Male homosexuality was decriminalised in the [[Australian Capital Territory]] in 1976, then [[Norfolk Island]] in 1993, following [[South Australia]] in 1975 and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in 1981. At the time of legalization (for the above), the age of consent, rape, defences, etc were all set gender-neutral and [[equal]] {{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}. [[Western Australia]] legalised male homosexuality in 1989 – Under the ''Law Reform (Decriminalization of Sodomy) Act 1989'', as did [[New South Wales]] and the [[Northern Territory]] in 1984 with unequal ages of consent of 18 for [[New South Wales]] and the [[Northern Territory]] and 21 for [[Western Australia]]. Then since 1997, the states and territories that retained different ages of consent or other vestiges of sodomy laws have tended to repeal them later; [[Western Australia]] did so in 2002, and [[New South Wales]] and the [[Northern Territory]] did so in 2003. [[Tasmania]] was the last state to decriminalise sodomy, doing so in 1997 after the groundbreaking cases of [[Toonen v Australia]] and [[Croome v Tasmania]] (it is also notable that Tasmania was the first jurisdiction to recognize same-sex couples in Australia since 2004 under the ''Relationships Act 2003''[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/tas/consol_act/ra2003173/].) Currently, the age of consent for anal sex in [[Queensland]] is higher at eighteen, as opposed to sixteen for both oral sex and vaginal sex (as the same in Canada) under section 208 of the Queensland ''Criminal Code'' [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/cc189994/s208.html].

=== Brazil ===
{{Main|LGBT rights in Brazil|Homosexuality legal in Brazil}}
Brazilian criminal law does not punish any sexual act performed by consenting adults, but allows for prosecution, under statutory rape laws and the children's protection act, when one of the participants is under 14 years of age and the other an adult, as per Articles 214, 223, 224 and 225 of the Brazilian Penal Code and Articles 240 and 244-A of the ''Estatuto da Criança e do Adolescente'' – Law 8.069.
Article 235 of the Brazilian Military Criminal Code – DL 1.001/69-, however, does incriminate any  contact deemed to be libidinous,  be it of a homosexual nature or not, made in any location subject to military administration. Since the article is entitled ''Of pederasty or other libidinous acts'', gay rights advocates claim that, since the Brazilian armed forces are composed almost exclusively of males,  the article allows for  witch-hunts against homosexuals in the military service.

===Canada===
{{Main|LGBT rights in Canada}}
Before 1859, Canada relied on British law to prosecute sodomy.  In 1859, Canada repatriated its buggery law in the Consolidated Statutes of Canada as an offense punishable by death.  Buggery remained punishable by death until 1869.  A broader law targeting all homosexual male sexual activity ("gross indecency") was passed in 1892, as part of a larger update to the criminal law.  Changes to the criminal code in 1948 and 1961 were used to brand gay men as "criminal sexual psychopaths" and "dangerous sexual offenders."  These labels provided for indeterminate prison sentences.  Most famously, [[George Klippert]], a homosexual, was labelled a dangerous sexual offender and sentenced to life in prison, a sentence confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada.  He was released in 1971.

[[Canada|Canadian]] law now permits anal sex by consenting parties above the age of 18, provided no more than two people are present. The bill repealing Canada's sodomy laws was the ''[[Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968-69]]'' (Bill C-150), which received royal assent on June 27, 1969. The bill had been introduced in the House of Commons by [[Pierre Trudeau]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Journals of the ''House of Commons'', vol. CXV (1968-69)}}&lt;/ref&gt; who famously stated that "there's no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Pierre Trudeau |date=1967-12-21 |title=The CBC Digital Archives Website |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/rights_freedoms/clip/2671/|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1995 [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] case ''R. v. M. (C.)'', the judges ruled that the relevant section (section 159) of the [[Criminal Code of Canada]] violated [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 15]] of the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] when one or both of the partners are 16 to 18 years of age; this has not been tried in court again.

A similar decision was made by the [[Quebec Court of Appeal]] in the 1998 case ''R. v. Roy''.

Exceptions are made between a married husband and wife, where it is legal if they are married.

=== China, People's Republic of ===
{{Main|LGBT rights in China}}
Sodomy was never explicitly criminalized in China. The [[Chinese Supreme Court]] ruled in 1957 that voluntary sodomy was not a criminal act.&lt;ref name=zhlaw&gt;http://www.law-lib.com/Law/law_view.asp?id=1218 最高人民法院关于成年人间自愿鸡奸是否犯罪问题的批复&lt;/ref&gt; Private sex in any form between two consenting adults does not violate laws. However, if someone under 18 is involved, the adult partner will be prosecuted. In a notable case in 2002, a man who had anal intercourse with a teenager was sentenced to three and a half years in prison. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

=== Hong Kong ===
"Homosexual Buggery". In [[Hong Kong]] [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|SAR]], according to the [[Hong Kong Crimes Ordinance]] [http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/e1bf50c09a33d3dc482564840019d2f4/72456972d8503a00c825648300322571?OpenDocument   Section 118C], both of the two men must be at least 21 to commit homosexual buggery legally or otherwise both of them can be liable to life imprisonment.  [http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/e1bf50c09a33d3dc482564840019d2f4/8b4492c77320a45fc82564830032258d?OpenDocument Sect 118F] states that committing homosexual buggery not privately is also illegal and can be liable to imprisonment for 5 years.

"Heterosexual Buggery". A man who commits buggery with a girl under 21 can also be liable to life imprisonment ([http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/e1bf50c09a33d3dc482564840019d2f4/b5f6aa259c4fe3d5c825648300322579?OpenDocument Sect 118D]) while no similar laws concerning committing heterosexual buggery otherwise than in private.

In 2005, Judge Hartmann found these 4 laws: Sect 118C, 118F, [http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/e1bf50c09a33d3dc482564840019d2f4/358ee74fe4af4162c82564830032259d?OpenDocument 118H], and [http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/e1bf50c09a33d3dc482564840019d2f4/c2d28bd1fc7b5b00c8256483003225ad?OpenDocument  118J] were discriminatory towards gay male and unconstitutional against the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] and Bills of Rights Ordinance in the judicial review filed by a Hong Kong citizen.  It was believed that the age of consent had been reduced from 21 to 16 for any kind of homosexual sex acts.  However, there were still individuals caught in spite of the judgement and there have been both cases in which the defendants were judged guilty and not guilty. Still, no revision has been made to the 4 deemed unconstitutional laws so far.

=== Macau ===
In [[Macau]] [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|SAR]], according to {{lang|pt|[[Código Penal de Macau]]}} [http://www.imprensa.macau.gov.mo/bo/i/95/46/codpenpt/codpen0101.asp Article 166 &amp; 168], committing anal coitus with whomever under the age of 17 is a crime and shall be punished by imprisonment of up to 10 years (committing with whoever under 14) and 4 years (committing with whoever between 14 and 16) respectively.

=== Taiwan===
{{Main|LGBT rights in Taiwan}}
In [[Taiwan]], the [[Criminal Code of Republic of China]] [http://law.moj.gov.tw/Scripts/Query1B.asp?no=1C000000110 Article 10] officially defines anal intercourse to be a form of sexual intercourse, along with vaginal and oral intercourse. The age of consent is 18, and [http://law.moj.gov.tw/Scripts/Query1B.asp?no=1C0000001227 Article 277] and the Child and Youth Sexual Transaction Prevention Act &lt;!-- Official name of this law could be found at http://english.www.gov.tw/Yearbook/index.jsp?categid=184&amp;recordid=52665--&gt;[http://law.moj.gov.tw/Scripts/Query1B.asp?no=1D005002322 Article 22] make it a criminal offense to engage in sexual contact with minors. The law is written in gender neutral terms and does not discriminate against homosexual conduct.

=== Denmark ===
{{Main|LGBT rights in Denmark}}
In 1933 Denmark became the third country in Europe to fully legalize homosexuality. The age of consent has been set at 15 since 1977.

=== France ===
{{Main|LGBT rights in France}}
Since the [[Penal Code of 1791]], [[France]] has not had laws punishing homosexual conduct ''per se'' between over-age consenting adults in private. However, other qualifications such as "offense to good mores" were occasionally retained in the 19th century ''(see [[Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès]])''.

In 1960, a parliamentary amendment by [[Paul Mirguet]] added homosexuality to a list of "[[social scourge]]s", along with [[alcoholism]] and [[prostitution]]. This prompted the government to increase the penalties for public display of a sex act when the act was homosexual. [[transvestism|Transvestites]] or homosexuals caught [[Cruising for sex|cruising]] were also the target of police repression.

In 1981, the 1960 law making homosexuality an aggravating circumstance for public indecency was repealed.  Then in 1982, under president [[François Mitterrand]], the law from 1942 ([[Vichy France]]) making the age of consent for homosexual sex higher (18) than for heterosexual sex (15) was also repealed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jopdf/common/jo_pdf.jsp?numJO=0&amp;dateJO=19820805&amp;numTexte=&amp;pageDebut=02502&amp;pageFin= Law 82-683 of 4 August 1982]&lt;/ref&gt; despite the vocal opposition  of [[Jean Foyer]] in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;[http://archives.assemblee-nationale.fr/7/cri/1981-1982-ordinaire1/153.pdf Proceedings of the National assembly], 2nd sitting of 20 December 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
{{Main|LGBT rights in Germany}}
[[Paragraph 175]], which punished "[[fornication]] between men", was eased to an [[age of consent]] of 21 in [[East Germany]] in 1957 and in [[West Germany]] in 1969.  This age was lowered to 18 in the East in 1968 and the West in 1973, and all legal distinctions between [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexuality|homosexual]] acts were abolished in the East in 1988, with this change being extended to all of Germany in 1994 as part of the process of [[German Reunification]].

In modern [[German language|German]], the term ''Sodomie'' has a meaning different from the [[English language|English]] word "[[sodomy]]": it does not refer to [[anal sex]], but acts of [[Zoophilia]].

=== Gibraltar ===
{{Main|LGBT rights in Gibraltar}}
Section 115 of the Criminal Offences Act prohibits "buggery with another person or with an
animal" and Section 116 prohibits "an act of gross indecency with another man", with the proviso that "Where the acts constituting the offences referred to in sections
115 and l16, occurred in private between two men who consented thereto
and at the time were over the age of 18 neither of such persons shall be guilty
of an offence". This has the unusual effect of permitting anal sex with a man, but not with a woman. Furthermore "in private" is defined as only between two persons, i.e. the presence of a third person makes it an offence. Also of note is the discriminatory age of consent which is 16 for heterosexual and lesbianism acts, but 18 for gay men.

=== Hungary ===
{{Main|LGBT rights in Hungary}}
[[Homosexuality]] in [[Hungary]] was decriminalized in 1962, [[Paragraph]] 199 of the [[Hungarian Penal Code]] from then on threatened "only" adults over 20 who engaged themselves in a consensual same-sex relationship with an underaged person between 14 and 20. Then in 1978 the age was lowered to 18. Since 2002, by the ruling of the [[Hungarian Constitutional Court]] repealed Paragraph 199 – Which provided an equal [[age of consent]] of '''14''', regardless of sexual orientation and/or gender. Since 1996, the ''Unregistered Cohabitation Act 1995'' was provided for any couple, regardless of gender and/or sexual orientation and from the 1 July 2009 the ''Registered Partnership Act 2009'' becomes effective, and provides a registered partnership just for same-sex couples – since that opposite-sex already have marriage, this would in-turn create duplication [http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/marriage_timeline.htm].

=== Iceland ===
{{Main|LGBT rights in Iceland}}
Homosexuality has been legal in [[Iceland]] since 1940, but equal age of consent was not approved until 1992. [[Civil union]] was legalised by [[Alþingi]] in 1996 with 44 votes pro, 1 con, 1 neutral and 17 not present. Those laws were changed to allow adoption and [[artificial insemination]] for [[lesbians]] 27 June 2006 among other things. [[Same-sex marriage in Iceland|Same-sex marriage]] was legalised in 2010.

=== India ===
{{Main|Homosexuality in India}}
India inherited anti-sodomy laws in its criminal code from the [[British Raj]], which were not present in its history of codified or customary legal system before. Since that section of Indian law, Section 377 of the ''[[Indian Penal Code]]'' violated the fundamental right of life and liberty and the right to equality as guaranteed by the [[Constitution of India]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2009/07/03/stories/2009070358010100.htm Delhi High Court strikes down Section 377 of IPC] the Hindu Front Page; Friday, Jul 03, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; it was read down by the Delhi High Court on July 2, 2009 in so far that it can no longer be applied to consensual sex between adults (of any gender) in private.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lobis.nic.in/dhc/APS/judgement/02-07-2009/APS02072009CW74552001.pdf IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI : WP(C) No.7455/2001]&lt;/ref&gt;  Section 377 called for a maximum punishment of life imprisonment for all ''carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal'' (primarily interpreted to be homosexuality, especially sodomy, including between consenting adults). This law had rarely been executed, if at all, in case of consenting adults, although sometimes was in the news when a homosexual rapist was apprehended. Police repression in alleged or real gay bars is common, and is often highlighted by the contemporary media.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homosexuality in India]]&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex marriages are ''de jure'' banned.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

=== Israel ===
{{Main|LGBT rights in Israel}}
The [[Israel|State of Israel]] inherited its sodomy ("buggery") law from the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] but there is no record that it was ever enforced against homosexual acts that took place between consenting adults in private.  In the late 1960s the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] ruled that these laws could not be enforced and they were formally repealed by the [[Knesset|Official legislature]] in 1988.  The [[age of consent]] for both heterosexuals and homosexuals is sixteen years of age.

In modern-day republican [[Italy]], same-sex intercourse between [[age of consent|consenting adults]], as well as anal sex between heterosexual partners above the legal age of consent is not punishable as a felony.

{{Main|LGBT rights in Japan}}

In the [[Meiji Period]], sex between men was punishable under the sodomy laws announced in 1872 and revised in 1873. This was changed by laws announced in 1880 （[[:ja:同性愛#同性愛に関する法と政治]]）. Since that time no further laws criminalizing homosexuality have been passed.

=== New Zealand ===
{{Main|LGBT rights in New Zealand}}

New Zealand inherited the United Kingdom's sodomy laws in 1854.
The Offences Against The Person Act of 1867 changed the penalty of buggery from execution to life imprisonment for "Buggery".  In 1961 in a revision of the Crimes Act, the penalty was reduced to a maximum of 7 years between consenting adult males.

Homosexual sex was legalised in New Zealand as a result of the passage of the [[Homosexual Law Reform Act|Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986]]. The age of consent was set at 16 years, the same as for heterosexual sex [[LGBT rights in New Zealand]].

Since 4 September 2007 two out of the three territories of New Zealand (Niue and Tokelau)  legalized homosexuality with an equal age of consent as well by the [http://www.austlii.edu.au/nz/legis/consol_act/naa2007146.pdf Niue Amendment Act 2007]. Cook Islands still has a sodomy law on the books [http://www.paclii.org/ck/legis/num_act/ca196982/ Crimes Act (1969), s153 and a155].

=== Poland ===
{{Main|LGBT rights in Poland}}
Poland is one of the very few countries in the world where homosexuality was never considered a crime by the state of law. [[1835|Forty years after]] Poland [[Partitions of Poland|lost its independence]] in [[1795]], the sodomy laws of [[Imperial Russia|Russia]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] came into force in the occupied Polish lands. They were officially abandoned in [[1932]], even though they had had actually no power since Poland regained its independence in [[1918]].

In fact, medieval Polish has a word for today’s "gay": ''mężołóstwo'' (that could be translated into [[English language|English]] as ''manication'').

=== Russia ===
{{Main|LGBT rights in Russia}}
In [[Russia]] sexual activity between males was criminalized by state law on March 4, 1934. Sexual activity between females was not mentioned in the law. On May 27, 1993, homosexual acts between consenting males were decriminalized.

[[Sections 377 and 377A of the Penal Code (Singapore)|Section 377A]] of the [[Singapore Penal Code]] criminalizes ("outrages on decency") additionally punishes commission, solicitation, or attempted male same-sex "gross indecency", with imprisonment up to two years [http://www.gaywired.com/article.cfm?id=17034&amp;section=67].  Prior to October 2007 Singaporean Section 377 was added by the British colonial administration in 1858, replacing Hindu law at the time  which had not criminalized consensual same-sex sexuality. In October 2007, [[Singapore]] has "repealed" section 377 in the Penal Code it will reduce the maximum sentence for male-male sex to just a maximum term of 2 years in prison under "maintained" section 377A.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.generationq.net/articles/Singapore-gay-sex-ban-to-remain-straight-ban-abolished-00001.html GenerationQ.net – News, Entertainment, Lifestyle and Opinion for GLBT Australia, USA, Canada, UK, Europe, Asia and South America&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|LGBT rights in Sweden}}
[[Sweden]] legalized homosexuality in 1944. The age of consent is 15, regardless of whether the sexual act is heterosexual or homosexual, since equalization in 1972. The Swedish Crime Law (SFS 1962:700), chapter six ('About Sexual Crimes'), shows gender-neutral terms and does not distinguish between sexual orientation. The only sexual act specifically mentioned in the law is intended indecent exposure (SUS 1762:779), chapter seventeen.

[[Sodomy]] was historically known in England and Wales as '''[[buggery]]''', and is usually interpreted as referring to anal intercourse between two males or a male and a female. In England and Wales Buggery was made a [[felony]] by the [[Buggery Act]] in 1533, during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. The punishment for those convicted was the death penalty right up until 1861. A lesser offence of "attempted buggery" was punished by 2 years of jail and some time on the [[pillory]]. In 1885, Parliament enacted the [[Labouchere Amendment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/englaw.html|title=The Law in England, 1290–1885|accessdate=2006-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; which prohibited ''gross indecency'' between males, a broad term that was understood to encompass most or all male homosexual acts. Following the [[Wolfenden report]], sexual acts between two adult males, with no other people present, were made legal in [[England and Wales]] in 1967, in [[Scotland]] in 1980 and [[Northern Ireland]] in 1982. The three UK crown territories also did this as well since 1983 in [[Guernsey]], since 1990 in [[Jersey]] and also since 1992 on the [[Isle of Man]].

In the 1980s and 1990s, attempts were made by [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|gay rights]] organizations to equalize the age of consent for heterosexuals and homosexuals, as the age of consent for homosexuals was set at 21, while the age of consent for heterosexuals was 16. Efforts were also made to modify the "no other person present" clause so that it dealt only with minors. In 1994, Conservative MP [[Edwina Currie]] introduced an amendment to Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill which would have lowered the age of consent to 16. The amendment failed, but a compromise amendment which lowered the age of consent to 18 was accepted. Therefore the age of consent disparity remained, albeit reduced. However, the July 1, 1997 decision in the case ''[[Sutherland v. United Kingdom]]'' resulted in the [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000]] which further reduced it to 16, and the "no other person present" clause was modified to "no minor persons present". Today, the universal age of consent is 16 in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The '''Sexual Offences NI Order 2008''' [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/sr/sr2008/nisr_20080510_en_1] brought Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the United Kingdom on the 2 February 2009 (prior to that, the age of consent for both heterosexuals and homosexuals was 17). The three UK crown territories also have an equal age of consent at 16 since 2006 on the [[Isle of Man]], since 2007 in [[Jersey]] and since 2010 in [[Guernsey]].

{{See also|LGBT rights in the United States}}
[[Sodomy laws in the United States]] were largely a matter of state rather than federal jurisdiction, except for laws governing the [[US Military|U.S. Armed Forces]].  By 2002, 36 states had repealed all sodomy laws or had them overturned by court rulings. The remaining sodomy laws were invalidated by the 2003 U.S. Supreme Court decision ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]''.

As for the [[United States armed forces|U.S. Armed Forces]], because "the military is, by necessity, a specialized society separate from civilian society,"&lt;ref&gt;Boston College: [http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/comm/free_speech/parker.html ''Parker v. Levy'' (1974)], accessed August 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; its ban on sodomy, Article 125 of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], is not entirely without force despite ''Lawrence v. Texas''. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces|Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces]] has ruled that the ''Lawrence v. Texas'' decision applies to Article 125. In both ''United States v. Stirewalt'' and ''United States v. Marcum'', the court ruled that the "conduct falls within the liberty interest identified by the Supreme Court,"&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces: [http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/opinions/2004Term/03-0433.htm U.S. v. Stirewalt, September 29, 2004], accessed August 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; but went on to say that despite the application of ''Lawrence'' to the military, Article 125 can still be upheld in cases where there are "factors unique to the military environment" that would place the conduct "outside any protected liberty interest recognized in ''Lawrence''."&lt;ref name=marcum&gt;U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces: [http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/opinions/2004Term/02-0944.htm U.S. v. Marcum, August 23, 2004], accessed August 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such factors could be fraternization, public sexual behavior, or any other factors that would adversely affect good order and discipline.&lt;ref name=marcum /&gt; Convictions for consensual sodomy have been overturned in military courts under the ''Lawrence'' precedent in both ''United States v. Meno''{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} and ''United States v. Bullock''.&lt;ref&gt;SodomyLaws.org: [http://www.sodomylaws.org/usa/military/milnews052.htm US v. Bullock (2004)], accessed August 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zimbabwe===
Zimbabwe's President [[Robert Mugabe]] has waged a violent [[LGBT rights in Zimbabwe|campaign against homosexuals]], claiming that before colonization Zimbabweans did not engage in homosexual acts.&lt;ref name="HOMO"&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN030647770X&amp;id=ezBvVdRnWKsC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213&amp;ots=6IWk0seKwp&amp;dq=Mugabe+moral+campaign+homosexuality&amp;sig=tzSDUBuYv5c6Y8admBfF-Y-Azbo Page 213] ''Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender: Men and Women in the World's Cultures''&lt;/ref&gt; His first major public condemnation of homosexuality&lt;!-- Perhaps mention a couple of the subsequent ones to cite "the first"? --&gt; came in 1995 during the Zimbabwe International Book Fair in August 1995.&lt;ref name="ZIB"&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0773527516&amp;id=LvxMq2hNzm0C&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;ots=xI8D2NLVGn&amp;dq=Mugabe+moral+campaign+homosexuality&amp;sig=-81GDIVzFqwX10TbJjaRAXlT2TE#PPA180,M1 Page 180] ''Hungochani: The History of a Dissident Sexuality in Southern Africa''&lt;/ref&gt; He told the audience that homosexuality:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...Degrades human dignity. It's unnatural and there is no question ever of allowing these people to behave worse than dogs and pigs. If dogs and pigs do not do it, why must human beings? We have our own culture, and we must re-dedicate ourselves to our traditional values that make us human beings... What we are being persuaded to accept is sub-animal behaviour and we will never allow it here. If you see people parading themselves as lesbians and gays, arrest them and hand them over to the police!"&lt;ref name="GAYRANT"&gt;[http://www.kaiwright.com/gayzimbabwe_more.php?id=101_0_25_0_M Under African Skies, Part I: 'Totally unacceptable to cultural norms'] Kaiwright.com&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In September 1995, Zimbabwe's parliament introduced legislation banning homosexual acts.&lt;ref name="ZIB"/&gt; In 1997, a court found [[Canaan Banana]], Mugabe's predecessor and the first President of Zimbabwe, guilty of 11 counts of sodomy and indecent assault.&lt;ref name="BANANAtrial"&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN9042016264&amp;id=PFvYzAUheGkC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;ots=0hbU6n9tV1&amp;dq=Canaan+Banana+homosexual&amp;sig=2cfQK_-ufIaV-egJ-ob6Wfu2kkQ Page 93] ''Body, Sexuality, and Gender v. 1''&lt;/ref&gt; Banana's trial proved embarrassing for Mugabe, when Banana's accusers alleged that Mugabe knew about Banana's conduct and had done nothing to stop it.&lt;ref name="bananadeath"&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/zimbabwe/article/0,2763,1082496,00.html Canaan Banana, president jailed in sex scandal, dies] ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, Banana fled Zimbabwe only to return in 1999 and served one year in prison for his homosexual acts. Banana was also stripped of his priesthood.
