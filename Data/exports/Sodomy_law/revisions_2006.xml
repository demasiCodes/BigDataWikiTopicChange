A '''sodomy law''' is a law which defines certain [[sexual acts]] as [[sex crime]]s. The precise sexual acts meant by the term [[sodomy]] — and its [[synonym]]s [[buggery]], [[crime against nature]], [[unnatural act]], [[deviant sexual intercourse]] and a range of similar [[euphemism]]s — is rarely spelled out in the legislation, but is typically understood by courts to include any sexual act which does not lead to [[procreation]].&lt;ref&gt;.Jeffrey Weeks, Sex, Politics and Society: The Regulation of Sexuality Since 1800, 2nd ed. (London: Longman Limited, 1989), 99.&lt;br&gt;''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' ruling - "Early American sodomy laws were not directed at homosexuals as such, but instead sought to prohibit nonprocreative sexual activity more generally"&lt;/ref&gt; While in theory this may include heterosexual [[oral sex]] and [[anal sex]], [[masturbation]] and [[bestiality]], in practice such laws are primarily enforced against sex between men, particularly anal sex.

Historians dispute the reason for the emergence of such laws, but they have roots in antiquity and are linked to religious proscriptions against certain sex acts. Contemporary supporters of sodomy laws argue that there are additional reasons for retaining them, such as public health concerns about anal sex, or concerns that legalisation of homosexuality will lead to a declining population.

Sodomy laws can be found around the world. As of 2006, consensual homosexual acts between adults are illegal in about 80 out of the 192 countries of the world; in 42 of these, only male-male sex is outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilga.info/Information/Legal_survey/summary_information_by_subject.htm ILGA World Legal Survey] (Last updated: 31 July 2000, accessed 19 April 2006); updates from [[Homosexuality laws of the world]]&lt;/ref&gt; This number has been declining since the second half of the 20th century.

== History ==
'''Lex Scantia''' is the earliest known law condemning the act of [[sodomy]], written by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].[http://www.infopt.demon.co.uk/homopho2.htm]

The Biblical book [[Leviticus]] defines sex between men as a crime that warrants [[capital punishment]].

In [[England]], [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] introduced the first legislation against homosexuals with the [[Buggery Act of 1533]], making [[buggery]] punishable by [[hanging]], a penalty not lifted until [[1861]].

Following Sir [[William Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch15.htm|work=Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England|title=Book the Fourth - Chapter the Fifteenth : Of Offences Against the Persons of Individuals|accessdate=2006-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the crime of sodomy has often been defined only as the ''abominable and detestable crime against nature'', or some variation of the phrase.  This language led to widely varying rulings about what specific acts were encompassed by its prohibition.  

After the publishing of the [[Wolfenden report]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], which claimed "homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence", many western governments, including the [[United States]], have repealed laws specifically against homosexual acts while retaining sodomy laws. In June 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' that [[U.S. state|state]] laws criminalizing private, non-commercial sexual activity (including homosexual activity) between consenting adults on the grounds of morality are unconstitutional since there is insufficient justification for state interest in such conduct.

In [[Europe]] (except [[Chechen Republic]]) and [[South America]] (except [[Guyana]]) there is no longer anti-sodomy laws. This trend among Western nations has not been followed in all other regions of the world (Africa, some parts of Asia, Oceania and the Caribbean Islands), where sodomy often remains a serious crime. Homosexual acts remain punishable by death in [[Iran]], [[Mauritania]], [[Pakistan]], [[Saudi-Arabia]], [[Sudan]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Yemen]] and some parts of [[Nigeria]] and [[Somalia]], and the [[Chechen Republic]] in Russia  (for the third conviction only) and by life in prison in [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[Guyana]], [[India]], [[Maldives]], [[Singapore]] and [[Uganda]].

==Sodomy laws by country==
=== Australia ===

[[Australia]] inherited the [[United Kingdom]]'s sodomy laws on colonisation in [[1788]].  These were retained in the criminal codes passed by the various colonial [[parliament]]s during the 19th century, and by the state parliaments after [[Federation]].

Following the [[Wolfenden report]], the [[Don Dunstan|Dunstan]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government introduced a ''consenting adults in private'' type defence in [[South Australia]] in [[1972]]. This defence was initiated as a bill by Murray Hill, father of former [[Defence Minister]] [[Robert Hill (Australian politician)|Robert Hill]], and repealed the state's sodomy law in [[1975]].  The [[Campaign Against Moral Persecution]] during the 1970s raised the profile and acceptance of Australia's gay and lesbian communities, and other states and territories repealed their laws between 1976 and 1990.  The exception was [[Tasmania]], which retained its laws until the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]] and the [[United Nations]] [[Human Rights Committee]] forced their repeal in 1997.  The details are given in the book ''Living out Loud: A History of Gay and Lesbian Activism in Australia''.

Since 1997, the states and territories that retained different ages of consent or other vestiges of sodomy laws have tended to repeal them. [[Western Australia]] did so in 2002, and [[New South Wales]] and the [[Northern Territory]] did so in 2003. In 2006 only [[Tasmania]] and [[Queensland]] are the Australian jurisdictions that still enforces a [[sodomy law]] - with the [[age of consent]] for [[anal sex]] being set at 18 (as compared to 16 for vaginal and [[oral sex]] in [[Queensland]]). And in [[Tasmania]], certain exceptions which constitute a defence do not apply if [[anal sex]] is involved with a person or persons under 17.

=== Brazil ===

Brazilian criminal law does not punish any sexual act performed by consenting adults, but allows for prosecution, under statutory rape laws and the childrens' protection act, when one of the participants is under 14 year of age and the other an adult.

=== Canada ===
Before 1859, Canada relied on British law to prosecute sodomy.  In 1859, Canada repatriated its buggery law in the Consolidated Statutes of Canada as an offense punishable by death.  Buggery remained punishable by death until 1869.  A broader law targeting all homosexual male sexual activity ("gross indecency") was passed in 1890.  Changes to the criminal code in 1948 and 1961 were used to brand gay men as "criminal sexual psychopaths" and "dangerous sexual offenders."  These labels provided for indeterminate prison sentences.  Most famously, [[Everett Klippert]], a homosexual, was labelled a dangerous sexual offender and sentenced to life in prison, a sentence confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada.  He was released in 1971.  

[[Canada|Canadian]] law now permits anal sex by consenting parties above the age of 18, provided no more than two people are present. Its sodomy laws were repealed in the [[1960s]] by [[Pierre Trudeau]] who famously stated that "the government has no place in the bedrooms of the nation". In the [[1995]] [[Ontario Court of Appeal]] case ''R. v. M. (C.)'', the judges ruled that the relevant section (section 159) of the [[Canadian Criminal Code|Criminal Code]] violated [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 15]] of the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] when one or both of the partners are 14 to 18 years of age; this has not been tried in court again.

A similar decision was made by the [[Quebec Court of Appeal]] in the [[1998]] case ''R. v. Roy''.

=== China ===
Sodomy laws have been abolished since the early [[1990s]] in the [[People's Republic of China]]. Yet there is no clear statute towards consenting parties above the age of 18. If someone under 18 is involved, the adult partner will be prosecuted. In a notable case in [[2002]], a man who had anal intercourse with a teenager was sentenced to three and a half years in prison.

===Denmark===
Denmark was the first country to fully legalize homosexuality, in 1934. The age of consent is the same for all people.

===France===
Since the [[French Revolution]], [[France]] has not had laws punishing homosexual conduct ''per se'' between over-age consenting adults in private. However, other qualifications such as "offense to good mores" were occasionally retained in the 19th century ''(see [[Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès]])''. Furthermore, the [[age of consent]] for homosexual sex was kept to the age of the [[legal majority]] (21 then 18), above the age for heterosexual sex (15), until [[1981]].

In [[1960]], a parliamentary amendment by [[Paul Mirguet]] added homosexuality to a list of "[[social scourge]]s", along with [[alcoholism]] and [[prostitution]]. This prompted the government to increase the penalties for public display of a sex act when the act was homosexual. [[Transvestite]]s or homosexuals caught [[Cruising for sex|cruising]] were also the target of police repression.

In [[1982]], under president [[François Mitterrand]], the last measures against homosexuality were repealed: one, dating from [[1942]] ([[Vichy France]]), making the age of consent for homosexual sex higher than for heterosexual sex, the other, dating from the [[1960s]], making homosexuality an aggravating circumstance for public indecency.

=== Germany ===
[[Paragraph 175]], which punished "[[fornication]] between men", was eased to an [[age of consent]] of 21 in [[East Germany]] in [[1957]] and in [[West Germany]] in [[1969]].  This age was lowered to 18 in the East in [[1968]] and the West in [[1973]], and all legal distinctions between [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexuality|homosexual]] acts were abolished in the East in [[1988]], with this change being extended to all of Germany in [[1994]] as part of the process of [[German Reunification]]. 

In modern [[German language|German]], the term ''Sodomie'' has a meaning different from the  [[English language|English]] word "[[sodomy]]": it does not refer to [[anal sex]] at all, but acts of [[Zoophilia]].

=== Hungary ===

[[Homosexuality]] in [[Hungary]] was decriminalized in [[1962]], [[Paragraph 199 of the Hungarian Penal Code]] from then on threatened "only" adults over 18 who engaged themselves in a consensual same-sex relationship with an underaged person between 14 and 18. In [[1995]] a kind of [[domestic partners]]hip was introduced for same sex couples, on [[September 3]], [[2002]] the ruling of the [[Hungarian Constitutional Court]] abrogated Paragraph 199; since then the [[age of consent]] for both sexes and both for heterosexuals and homosexuals, is 14 years.

=== Iceland ===

Homosexuality has been legal in [[Iceland]] since 1940, but equal age of consent was not approved until 1992. [[Civil union]] was legalised by [[Alþingi]] in [[1996]] with 44 votes pro, 1 con, 1 neutral and 17 not present. Those laws were changed to allow adoption and [[artificial insemination]] for [[lesbians]] 27th of June 2006 among other things. Civil Union of Lesbians and Gays is now equal to marriage of heterosexual people, except it cannot be performed by religious foundations, only the State.

=== India ===

India also inherited the anti-sodomy laws in its criminal code from the [[British raj]], which were not present in its history of codified or customary legal system before. Article 377 of the ''[[Indian Penal Code]]'' calls for a maximum punishment of life imprisonment for all ''sexual acts against human nature'' (primarily interpreted to be homosexuality, especially sodomy, including between consenting adults). This law has rarely been executed, if at all, in case of consenting adults, although sometimes comes in the news when a homosexual rape has been conducted and the rapist is arrested. Police repression in alleged or real gay bars is common, and is often highlighted by the contemporary media. Homosexual marriages are ''de facto'' banned.

=== Israel ===
{{main|Gay rights in Israel}}

The [[Israel|State of Israel]] inherited its sodomy ("buggery") law from the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] but there is no record that it was ever enforced against homosexual acts that took place between consenting adults in private.  In the late [[1960s]] the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] ruled that these laws could not be enforced and they were formally repealed by the national legislative assembly in [[1988]].  The [[age of consent]] for both heterosexuals and homosexuals is sixteen years of age.

===Singapore===

See [[Section 377 of the Singapore Penal Code]]

===Sweden===

[[Sweden]] was the second country to fully legalize homosexuality, in 1944.  The age of consent is 15 regardless of sexuality. The Swedish Crime Law (SFS 1962:700), chapter six ('About Sexual Crimes')), does not distinguish between heterosexual and homosexual sexual acts. The only sexual act specifically mentioned in the law is intended indecent exposure.

=== United Kingdom ===

The [[United Kingdom|UK]] has historically had similar laws, but the offence is known as '''[[buggery]]''', not sodomy, and is usually interpreted as referring to anal intercourse between two males or a male and a female. Buggery was made a [[felony]] by the [[Buggery Act]] in [[1533]], during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. In [[1885]], Parliament enacted the [[Labouchere Amendment]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/englaw.html|title=The Law in England, 1290-1885|accessdate=2006-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which prohibited ''gross indecency'' between males, a broad term that was understood to encompass most or all male homosexual acts. Following the [[Wolfenden report]], sexual acts between two adult males, with no other people present, were made legal in [[England and Wales]] in [[1967]], in [[Scotland]] in [[1980]] and [[Northern Ireland]] in [[1982]]. 

In the [[1980s]] and [[1990s]], attempts were made by [[gay rights]] organizations to equalize the age of consent for heterosexuals and homosexuals, as the age of consent for homosexuals was set at 21, while the age of consent for heterosexuals was 16. Efforts were also made to modify the "no other person present" clause so that it dealt only with minors. In 1994, Conservative MP [[Edwina Currie]] introduced an amendment to Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill which would have lowered the age of consent to 16. The amendment failed, but a compromise amendment which lowered the age of consent to 18 was accepted. The age of consent remained 18 until the [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000]] which further reduced it to 16, and the "no other person present" clause was modified to "no minor persons present". Today, the universal age of consent is 16 in England, Scotland, and Wales. The age of consent for both heterosexuals and homosexuals remains at 17 in Northern Ireland.

=== United States ===

[[Sodomy laws in the United States]], laws primarily intended to outlaw homosexual acts were largely a matter of state rather than federal jurisdiction.  By the last quarter of the [[20th century]], 47 out of 50 states had repealed any specifically [[Anti-homosexualism|anti-homosexual-conduct]] laws, and 37 had repealed all sodomy laws. The remaining [[Anti-homosexualism|anti-homosexual]] laws have been invalidated by the 2003 U.S. Supreme Court decision ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (see above).  The United States Supreme Court also implied that the [[age of consent]] must be the same for heterosexuals and homosexuals when it ordered the Kansas courts to review the constititonality of the state's Romeo and Juliet Law.

The term "crime against nature" was first used in law in [[1828]].
