A '''sodomy law''' is a law that defines certain [[Human sexual activity|sexual acts]] as [[Sex and the law|crimes]]. The precise sexual acts meant by the term ''[[sodomy]]'' are rarely spelled out in the law, but are typically understood by courts to include any sexual act deemed to be "unnatural" or "immoral".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Weeks | first = Jeff | title =Sex, Politics and Society: The Regulation of Sexuality Since 1800 | publisher = Longman Publishing Group |date=January 1981 | location = London | isbn = 0-582-48334-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sodomy typically includes [[anal sex]], [[oral sex]], and [[zoophilia|bestiality]].&lt;ref name="Phelps"&gt;{{cite book| first= Shirelle |last= Phelps|title=World of Criminal Justice: N-Z|publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Gale Group]]|year=2001|page=686|isbn =0787650730|access-date=13 January 2014 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=izwvAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=World+of+Criminal+Justice:+N-Z.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheb"&gt;{{cite book| first1= John |last1= Scheb| first2= John II |last2= Scheb |title= Criminal Law and Procedure|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2013|page=185|isbn =978-1285546131|access-date=13 January 2014 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VZoWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;{{cite book| first= David| last= Newton|title=Gay and Lesbian Rights: A Reference Handbook| edition= 2nd |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2009|page=85|isbn =978-1598843071|access-date=13 January 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gjcUFK4RZNcC&amp;pg=PA85}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, sodomy laws have rarely been enforced against [[heterosexual]] couples, and have mostly been used to target [[Same-sex relationship|homosexual couples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/64542/unnatural-law| title=Unnatural Law |last=Sullivan |first=Andrew |author-link=Andrew Sullivan |date=24 March 2003 |magazine=The New Republic |access-date=12 November 2020 |volume=228 |issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] passed an [[LGBT rights]] resolution, which was followed up by a report published by the UN Human Rights Commissioner which included scrutiny of the mentioned codes.

===Criminalization===
[[File:Burning of Sodomites.jpg|thumb|200px|Burning of the accused sodomites outside the walls of [[Zürich]], 1482 (from the ''[[Spiezer Schilling]]'' chronicle)]]
The Middle [[Assyria]]n [[Assyrian law|Law Codes]] (1075 BC) state: If a man has intercourse with his brother-in-arms, they shall turn him into a [[eunuch]]. This is the earliest known law condemning the act of male-to-male intercourse in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/1075assyriancode.html|title=The Code of the Assura, c. 1075 BCE| via= fordham.edu |access-date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Republic]], the ''[[Lex Scantinia]]'' (which is first described in documents dating back to 50 BCE) imposed penalties on those who committed a sex crime ''([[stuprum]])'' against a [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexuality and children|freeborn male minor]]. The law may also have been used to prosecute male citizens who willingly played the [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|passive role in same-sex acts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Thomas A.

Starting in the 1200s, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] launched a massive campaign against sodomites, especially homosexuals.&lt;ref name= Boswell-CSTH /&gt; Between the years 1250 and 1300, homosexual activity was radically criminalized in most of Europe, even punishable by death.&lt;ref name= Boswell-CSTH /&gt;{{rp|293}}

In [[England]], [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] introduced the first legislation under English criminal law against sodomy with the [[Buggery Act of 1533]], making [[buggery]] punishable by [[hanging]], a penalty not lifted until 1861.

Following Sir [[William Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch15.htm|work=Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England|title=Book the Fourth – Chapter the Fifteenth: Of Offences Against the Persons of Individuals |access-date=6 August 2006 |url-status=dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060907230432/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch15.htm|archive-date=7 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; the crime of sodomy has often been defined only as the "abominable and detestable crime against nature", or some variation of the phrase. This language led to widely varying rulings about what specific acts were encompassed by its prohibition.

{{Decriminalization of homosexuality timeline}}
In 1786 [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Pietro Leopoldo of Tuscany]], abolishing [[death penalty]] for all crimes, became not only the first Western ruler to do so, but also the first ruler to abolish death penalty for sodomy (which was replaced by prison and hard labour).

In [[France]], it was the French Revolutionary penal code (issued in 1791) which for the first time struck down "sodomy" as a crime, decriminalizing it together with all "victimless-crimes" (sodomy, heresy, witchcraft, blasphemy), according with the concept that if there was no victim, there was no crime. The same principle was held true in the [[French Penal Code of 1810|Napoleon Penal Code]] in 1810, which was imposed on the large part of Europe then ruled by the [[French Empire (1804–1815)|French Empire]] and its cognate kings, thus decriminalizing sodomy in most of Continental Europe.

In 1830, Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil]] signed a law into the Imperial Penal Code. It eliminates all references to sodomy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brazzil.com/blamar00.htm ''Beyond Carnival'']. Green, James. [[The University of Chicago Press]]. 1999. {{in lang|pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Ottoman Empire]], homosexuality was decriminalized in 1858 as part of wider reforms during the [[Tanzimat]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faith-matters.org/images/stories/fm-publications/the-tanzimat-final-web.pdf|title=The Tanzimat: Secular Reforms in the Ottoman Empire|author=Ishtiaq Hussain|publisher=Faith Matters|date=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-25927595 |title=Where is it illegal to be gay? |access-date=25 January 2015 |work=BBC News|date=10 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The death penalty was not lifted in England and Wales until 1861.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In 1917, following the Bolshevik Revolution led by [[V.I. Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Russia]] legalized homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hazard |first1=John N. |title=Unity and Diversity in Socialist Law |journal=Law and Contemporary Problems |publisher=Duke Law |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=270–290 |url= https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3056&amp;context=lcp|doi=10.2307/1190515 |jstor=1190515 |year=1965 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when [[Joseph Stalin]] came to power in 1920s, these laws were reversed until homosexuality was effectively made illegal again by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= West| first= Green| url= |title=Sociolegal Control of Homosexuality: A Multi-Nation Comparison| page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=AwD3FNUJjXwC&amp;pg=PA223#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 224]| publisher= | via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Mark| last= Sereisky| title= Great Soviet Encyclopedia| year= 1930| page= 593}}{{quote|Soviet legislation does not recognize so-called crimes against morality.

During the [[First Czechoslovak Republic]] (1918–1938), there was a movement to repeal sodomy laws. It has been claimed that this was the first campaign to repeal anti-gay laws that was spearheaded primarily by heterosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Himl |first1=Pavel |title= Oponentský posudek rigorózní práce Jana Seidla 'Úsilí o odtrestnění homosexuality za první republiky' |url=https://is.muni.cz/th/64594/ff_r/hi_seidl_himl.txt| website= is.muni.cz| language= Czech| trans-title= Opponent's review of Jan Seidl's rigorous thesis 'Efforts to Punish Homosexuality in the First Republic' |access-date=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the publishing of the 1957 [[Wolfenden report]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], which asserted that "homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence", many western governments, including many U.S. states, repealed laws specifically against homosexual acts. However, by 2003, 13 U.S. states still criminalized homosexuality, along with many Missouri counties, and the territory of Puerto Rico, but in June 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' that [[U.S. state|state]] laws criminalizing private, non-commercial sexual activity between consenting adults at home on the grounds of morality are unconstitutional since there is insufficient justification for intruding into people's liberty and privacy.

There have never been Western-style sodomy related laws in the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, North Korea, South Korea, Poland, or Vietnam{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}. Additionally, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia were part of the French colony of [[French Indochina|Indochina]]; male homosexual acts have been legal throughout the French Empire since the issuing of the aforementioned French Revolutionary penal code in 1791.

===Criminalization in modern days===
This trend among Western nations has not been followed in all other regions of the world (Africa, some parts of Asia, Oceania and even western countries in the Caribbean Islands), where sodomy often remains a serious crime. For example, male homosexual acts, at least in theory, can result in life imprisonment in Barbados and Guyana.

As of 2022, sodomy related laws have been repealed or judicially struck down in all of Europe, North America, and South America, except for Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://76crimes.com/76-countries-where-homosexuality-is-illegal/ | title=69 countries where homosexuality is illegal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Africa, male homosexual acts remain punishable by death in Mauritania and some parts of Nigeria and Somalia. Male and sometimes female homosexual acts are minor to major criminal offences in many other African countries; for example, life imprisonment is a prospective penalty in Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.&lt;ref name= ILGA-2019&gt;{{cite web| url= https://ilga.org/downloads/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2019.pdf| title= State Sponsored Homophobia| website= ILGA.org| year= 2019| publisher= International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association| access-date= 30 September 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable exception is South Africa, where same-sex marriage is legal.

In Asia, male homosexual acts remain punishable by death in [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name= ILGA-2019 /&gt; Anti-sodomy laws have been repealed in [[Israel]] (which recognises but does not perform same-sex marriages), [[Japan]], [[Kazakhstan]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Thailand]].{{cn|date= September 2021}}

== Sodomy-related legal positions by country ==

=== Australia ===
{{Main|LGBT rights in Australia}}

Upon colonisation in 1788, Australia inherited laws from the United Kingdom including the [[Buggery Act]] of 1533.  These were retained in the criminal codes passed by the various colonial parliaments during the 19th century, and by the state parliaments after [[Federation]].&lt;ref name=carbery&gt;{{cite web |last=Carbery |first=Graham |title=Towards Homosexual Equality in Australian Criminal Law: A Brief History |year=2010 |edition=2nd |url=http://www.alga.org.au/files/towardsequality2ed.pdf |publisher=Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Wolfenden report]], the [[Don Dunstan|Dunstan]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government introduced a ''consenting adults in private'' type legal defence in South Australia in 1972. This defence was initiated as a bill by Murray Hill, father of former [[defence minister]] [[Robert Hill (Australian politician)|Robert Hill]], and repealed the state's sodomy law in 1975.  The Campaign Against Moral Persecution during the 1970s raised the profile and acceptance of Australia's gay and lesbian communities, and other states and territories repealed their laws between 1976 and 1990. The exception was [[Tasmania]], which retained its laws until the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]] and the United Nations [[Human Rights Committee]] forced their repeal in 1997.

Male homosexuality was decriminalised in the [[Australian Capital Territory]] in 1976, then [[Norfolk Island]] in 1993, following South Australia in 1975 and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in 1981. At the time of legalization (for the above), the age of consent, rape, defences, etc. were all set gender-neutral and equal {{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}. Western Australia legalised male homosexuality in 1989 – Under the ''Law Reform (Decriminalization of Sodomy) Act 1989'', as did [[New South Wales]] and the [[Northern Territory]] in 1984 with unequal ages of consent of 18 for New South Wales and the Northern Territory and 21 for Western Australia. Then since 1997, the states and territories that retained different ages of consent or other vestiges of sodomy laws have tended to repeal them later; Western Australia did so in 2002, and New South Wales and the Northern Territory did so in 2003. Tasmania was the last state to decriminalise sodomy, doing so in 1997 after the groundbreaking cases of ''[[Toonen v Australia]]'' and ''Croome v Tasmania'' (it is also notable that Tasmania was the first jurisdiction to recognize same-sex couples in Australia since 2004 under the ''Relationships Act 2003''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/tas/consol_act/ra2003173/|title= Relationships Act 2003 |via= austlii.edu.au |access-date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In 2016, Queensland became the final Australian jurisdiction to equalise its [[age of consent]] for all forms of sexual activity at 16 years, after reducing the age of consent for [[anal sex]] from 18 years.&lt;ref name="archaic-end"&gt;{{cite news| last1= Burke| first1= Gail| title= Queensland lowers anal sex consent age to 16, ending 'archaic' law|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-15/queensland-standardises-age-of-consent-laws-anal-sex/7850112| access-date=17 September 2016|work=ABC News|agency=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=15 September 2016|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Botswana ===
{{Main|LGBT rights in Botswana}}
Same-sex sexual acts became legal in Botswana on 11 June 2019. Previously, sodomy, whether heterosexual or homosexual, was criminalised, punishable by up to seven years' imprisonment. The law criminalising such sexual activity applied to both men and women. Initially, its application was limited to men only (similar to other colonies of the [[British Empire]]), however, a Botswana court found this to be discriminatory and that the law should apply to women as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newnownext.com/why-more-and-more-countries-are-making-it-illegal-to-be-a-lesbian-or-bi-woman/02/2017/|title=Why More And More Countries Are Making It Illegal To Be A Lesbian Or Bi Woman|first=Kristina|last=Marusic 2/22/2017|website=LOGO News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===
{{Main|LGBT rights in Brazil|Legal status of homosexuality in Brazil}}
Brazilian criminal law does not punish any sexual act performed by consenting adults, but allows for prosecution, under statutory rape laws, when one of the participants is under 14 years of age and the other an adult, as per Articles 217-A of the Brazilian Penal Code. Pedophilic acts are also criminalized by the Children and Teenager Statute, in articles 241-A to 241-E. Article 235 of the Brazilian Military Criminal Code – DL 1.001/69-, however, does incriminate any contact deemed to be libidinous, be it of a homosexual nature or not, made in any location subject to military administration. Since the article is entitled "Of pederasty or other libidinous acts", gay rights advocates claim that, since the Brazilian armed forces are composed almost exclusively of males, the article allows for witch-hunts against homosexuals in the military service. This article of the Military Criminal Code has been ruled partialy unconstitutional by the Brazilian Supreme Court (ADPF 291), in a 2019 decision that considered incompatible with the Constitutuon the expressions "Of pederasty or others" (mentioned in the entitlement) and "homossexual or not" (contained in the article).

=== Canada ===
{{Main|LGBT rights in Canada}}
Before 1859, the [[Province of Canada]] prosecuted sodomy under the English Buggery Act.  In 1859, the Province of Canada enacted its own [[buggery]] law in the Consolidated Statutes of Canada as an offence punishable by death.  Buggery remained punishable by death until 1869.  A broader law targeting all homosexual male sexual activity ("gross indecency") was passed in 1892, as part of a larger update to the criminal law of the new dominion of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code, 1892, SC 1892, c 29&lt;/ref&gt; Changes to the ''[[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]'' in 1948 and 1961 were used to brand gay men as "criminal sexual psychopaths" and "dangerous sexual offenders."

Sodomy was decriminalized after the ''[[Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968-69]]'' (Bill C-150) received royal assent on 27 June 1969. The offences of buggery and "gross indecency" were still in force, however the new act introduced exemptions for married couples, and any two consenting adults above the age of 21 regardless of gender or sexual orientation. The bill had been originally introduced in the House of Commons in 1967 by then Minister of Justice [[Pierre Trudeau]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Journals of the House of Commons |volume=CXV |year=1968–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; who famously stated that "there's no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Pierre Trudeau |date=21 December 1967 |title=The CBC Digital Archives Website |url= http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/rights_freedoms/clip/2671/ |publisher= [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]| website= archives.cbc.ca| access-date=15 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revisions to the ''Criminal Code'' in 1987 repealed the offence of "gross indecency", changed "buggery" to "anal intercourse" and reduced the age exemption from 21 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;''An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Canada Evidence Act'', R.S.C. 1985 (3d Supp.), c. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 159 of the ''Criminal Code'' continued to criminalize anal sex in general, with exemptions (provided no more than two people are present) for husbands and wives, and two consenting parties above the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-73.html#docCont|title=Criminal Code (R.S.C., 1985, c.

Subsequent [[case law]] held that section 159 was [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]], thus anal sex was ''de facto'' legal between any two or more [[Consent to sexual activity|consenting]] persons above the [[age of consent]] (14). In the 1995 [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] case ''R. v. M. (C.)'' the judges ruled that the law was unconstitutional on the basis that the specific exemptions based on marital status and age infringed on the [[social equality|equality rights]] guaranteed by [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 15]] of the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], and constituted discrimination based on sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qrd.org/qrd/world/legal/youth.sodomy.law.ruling.txt |title=Ontario Youth Sodomy Law Ruling |access-date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar decision was made by the [[Quebec Court of Appeal]] in the 1998 case ''R. v.

In Hong Kong "Homosexual Buggery" is prohibited. Before 2014, according to the [[Crimes Ordinance]] Section 118C,&lt;ref&gt;CRIMES ORDINANCE, Chapter 200, Section 118C, [http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s118c-19970630.html.html Homosexual buggery with or by man under 21], hklii.hk&lt;/ref&gt; both of the two men must be at least 16 to commit homosexual buggery legally or otherwise both of them can be liable to life imprisonment.  [https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s118D.html Sect 118F] states that committing homosexual buggery not privately is also illegal and can be liable to imprisonment for 5 years.

"Heterosexual Buggery". A man who commits buggery with a girl under 21 can also be liable for life imprisonment ([http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s118d.html Sect 118D]) while no similar laws concerning committing heterosexual buggery in private exist.

In 2005, [[Michael Hartmann (judge)|Judge Hartmann]] found these 4 laws: Sect 118C, 118F, [https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s118H.html 118H], and [https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s118J.html 118J] were discriminatory towards gay males and unconstitutional under the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] and contrary to the Bill of Rights Ordinance in a judicial review filed by a Hong Kong resident.  It was believed that the age of consent had been reduced from 21 to 16 for any kind of homosexual sex acts. In 2014, the ordinance was amended according to the judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/egazettedownload?EGAZETTE_PDF_ID=11146 |title=Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance 2014 |publisher=Elegislation.gov.hk |date=1 January 1970 |access-date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Denmark ===
{{Main|LGBT rights in Denmark}}
In 1933, Denmark legalized homosexuality. The age of consent has been set at 15 since 1977.

=== France ===
{{Main|LGBT rights in France}}
Since the [[Penal Code of 1791]], France has not had laws punishing homosexual conduct ''per se'' between over-age consenting adults in private. However, other qualifications such as "offense to good mores" were occasionally retained in the 19th century ''(see [[Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès]])''.

In 1960, a [[:fr:Amendement Mirguet|parliamentary amendment]] by Paul Mirguet added homosexuality to a list of "social scourges", along with alcoholism and prostitution. This prompted the government to increase the penalties for public display of a sex act when the act was homosexual. [[transvestism|Transvestites]] or homosexuals caught [[Cruising for sex|cruising]] were also the target of police repression.

In 1981, the 1960 law making homosexuality an aggravating circumstance for public indecency was repealed.  Then in 1982, under president [[François Mitterrand]], the law from 1942 ([[Vichy France]]) making the age of consent for homosexual sex higher (18) than for heterosexual sex (15) was also repealed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jopdf/common/jo_pdf.jsp?numJO=0&amp;dateJO=19820805&amp;numTexte=&amp;pageDebut=02502&amp;pageFin=|title=Fac-similé JO du 05/08/1982, page 02502 – Legifrance|access-date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the vocal opposition of [[Jean Foyer]] in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.assemblee-nationale.fr/7/cri/1981-1982-ordinaire1/153.pdf Proceedings of the National assembly], 2nd sitting of 20 December 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
{{Main|LGBT rights in Germany}}
[[Paragraph 175]], which punished "[[fornication]] between men", was eased to an [[age of consent]] of 21 in [[East Germany]] in 1957 and in West Germany in 1969.  This age was lowered to 18 in the East in 1968 and the West in 1973, and all legal distinctions between [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexuality|homosexual]] acts were abolished in the East in 1988, with this change being extended to all of Germany in 1994 as part of the process of [[German Reunification]].

In modern [[German language|German]], the term ''Sodomie'' has a meaning different from the [[English language|English]] word "[[:wiktionary:sodomy|sodomy]]": it does not refer to anal sex, but acts of [[Zoophilia]]. The change occurred mostly in the middle of the 19th century, at least in the last decade of the century. Only the moral theology of the Roman Catholic church changed not until some time after World War II to the term ''homosexuality''.

In [[Gibraltar]], a [[British overseas territories|British overseas territory]], male homosexual acts (but not heterosexual anal sex) have been decriminalised in [[Gibraltar]] since 1993, where the age of consent was 18 for male homosexual acts.

Then in 1978 the age was lowered to 18. Since 2002, by the ruling of the [[Constitutional Court of Hungary]] repealed Paragraph 199 – Which provided an equal age of consent of 14, regardless of sexual orientation and/or gender. Since 1996, the ''Unregistered Cohabitation Act 1995'' was provided for any couple, regardless of gender and/or sexual orientation and from 1 July 2009 the ''Registered Partnership Act 2009'' becomes effective, and provides a registered partnership just for same-sex couples – since that opposite-sex already have marriage, this would in-turn create duplication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/marriage_timeline.htm |title=UK Gay News – Gay and Lesbian Marriage, Partnership or Unions Worldwide |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615184256/http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/marriage_timeline.htm |archive-date=15 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 July 2009, in the case of ''[[Naz Foundation v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi|Naz Foundation v National Capital Territory of Delhi]]'', the High Court of Delhi struck down much of S. 377 of the IPC as being unconstitutional. The Court held that to the extent S. 377 criminalised consensual non-vaginal sexual acts between adults, it violated an individual's fundamental rights to equality before the law, freedom from discrimination and to life and personal liberty under Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the [[Constitution of India]]. The High Court did not strike down S. 377 completely – it held the section was valid to the extent it related to non-consensual non-vaginal intercourse or to intercourse with minors – and it expressed the hope that Parliament would soon legislatively address the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jul/21/india-gay-rights-law|title=A New Law for India's Sexual Minorities|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=21 July 2009|author=Yuvraj Joshi|access-date=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India does not recognize same-sex unions of any type. On 11 December 2013, the Supreme Court of India overturned the ruling in ''Naz Foundation v.

===Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 abolished the offence of "buggery between persons".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0020/sec0002.html Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993; §2: Abolition of offence of buggery between persons.] Irish Statute Book.&lt;/ref&gt; For some years prior to 1993, criminal prosecution had not been made for buggery between consenting adults.

=== Israel ===
{{Main|LGBT rights in Israel}}
The State of Israel inherited its sodomy ("buggery") law from the legal code of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], but it was never enforced against homosexual acts that took place between consenting adults in private. In 1963, the Israeli Attorney-General declared that these laws would not be enforced. However, in certain criminal cases, defendants were convicted of "sodomy" (which includes [[oral sex]]), apparently by way of plea bargains; they had originally been indicted for more serious sexual offenses.

In the late 1960s, the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israeli Supreme Court]] ruled that these laws could not be enforced against consenting adults. Though unenforced, these laws remained in the penal code until 1988, when they were formally repealed by the [[Knesset]]. The [[age of consent]] for both heterosexuals and homosexuals is 16 years of age.

=== Italy ===
{{Main|LGBT rights in Italy}}
In 1786, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Pietro Leopoldo of Tuscany]], abolishing [[death penalty]] for all crimes, became not only the first Western ruler to do so, but also the first ruler to abolish death penalty for sodomy (though this was replaced with other sentences such as terms in prison or of hard labour).

The Code Napoléon made sodomy legal between consenting adults above the legal age of consent in all Italy except in the Kingdom of Sardinia, the Austria-ruled Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, and the Papal states.

In the newborn (1860) [[Kingdom of Italy]], Sardinia extended its legal code on the whole of Northern Italy, but not in the South, which made homosexual behaviour legal in the South and illegal in the North. However the first Italian penal code (Codice Zanardelli, 1889), decriminalised same-sex intercourse between consenting adults above the legal age of consent for all regions; a law that has not changed since it was enacted.

=== Japan ===
{{Main|LGBT rights in Japan}}

In the [[Meiji Period]], sex between men was punishable under the sodomy laws announced in 1872 and revised in 1873. This was changed by laws announced in 1880 ([[:ja:同性愛#同性愛に関する法と政治|同性愛に関する法と政治]]). Since that time no further laws criminalizing homosexuality have been passed.

=== Malaysia ===

Sodomy is illegal in Malaysia. The sodomy laws are sometimes enforced using Section 377 of the [[Penal Code (Malaysia)|Penal Code]] which prohibit [[carnal intercourse]] against the order of nature.

{{quote|Any person who has sexual connection with another person by the introduction of the penis into the anus or mouth of the other person is said to commit carnal intercourse against the order of nature.}}

The age of consent in Malaysia is 16. Punishment for voluntarily committing carnal intercourse against the order of nature shall be up to twenty years [[imprisonment]] and [[flagellation|whipping]], while punishment for committing the same offence but without consent is punished by no less than five years imprisonment and whipping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

New Zealand inherited the United Kingdom's sodomy laws in 1854.
The Offences Against The Person Act of 1867 changed the penalty of buggery from execution to life imprisonment for "Buggery".  In 1961 in a revision of the Crimes Act, the penalty was reduced to a maximum of 7 years between consenting adult males.

Homosexual sex was legalised in New Zealand as a result of the passing of the [[Homosexual Law Reform Act|Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986]]. The age of consent was set at 16 years, the same as for heterosexual sex.

Poland is one of the few countries where homosexuality has never been considered a crime. Forty years after Poland [[Partitions of Poland|lost its independence]], in 1795, the sodomy laws of [[Imperial Russia|Russia]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] came into force in the occupied Polish lands. Poland retained these laws after independence in 1918, but they were never enforced, and were officially abandoned in 1932.

The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia restricted the offense in 1959 to only apply to homosexual anal intercourse, with the maximum sentence reduced from 2 to 1 year imprisonment. In 1994, male homosexual sexual intercourse was officially decriminalised in the [[Republic of Serbia (1992–2006)|Republic of Serbia]], a part of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. The [[age of consent]] was set at 18 years for anal intercourse between males and 14 for other sexual practices.

[[Sodomy]] is usually interpreted as referring to anal intercourse between two males or a male and a female. In England and Wales sodomy was made a [[felony]] by Henry VIII's Act of 1533, which was part of the attack on the monasteries, though had been a crime punished by the clergy until 1534. The Act of 1533 also criminalised sex with animals. Section 61 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], entitled "Sodomy and Bestiality", defined punishments for "the abominable Crime of Buggery, committed either with Mankind or with any Animal". The punishment for those convicted was the death penalty until 1861 in England and Wales, and 1887 in Scotland. [[James Pratt and John Smith]] were the last two to be executed for sodomy in England in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;Cocks, Nameless Offences&lt;/ref&gt; However, all homoerotic acts could be prosecuted under the 1533 law as they were all treated by the courts as "attempts" to commit the felony (sodomy) whether there had been an actual attempt to commit anal intercourse or not. This interpretation was in place by at least the 1690s.&lt;ref&gt;Cocks, Visions of Sodom&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, it was possible to prosecute all homoerotic acts, invitations, or suggestions as "attempts" to commit the felony or conspiracies to arrange it. Between 1806, when reliable figures begin, and 1900, there were more than 8,000 cases of what were called "unnatural offences," including 404 capital sentences and 56 executions (all before 1835).&lt;ref&gt;H G Cocks, Visions of Sodom; Nameless Offences&lt;/ref&gt; Some confusion over the state of the law and what it covered has resulted from the intervention of Henry Labouchere, who, in 1885 introduced a clause to the Criminal Law Amendment Act that outlawed "gross indecency" between men "in public and private." Many historians have assumed as a result that before that date homoerotic acts were not covered by the law, or were only prosecuted if committed in public.{{Citation Needed|date=August 2022}} This is not the case. Labouchere's Amendment added nothing to the law except another way of describing what was already illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Cocks, Nameless Offences; Visions of Sodom; {{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/englaw.html|title=The Law in England, 1290–1885|access-date=6 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Wolfenden report]], sexual acts between two adult males, with no other people present, were made legal in [[England and Wales]] in 1967, in Scotland in 1980, [[Northern Ireland]] in 1982, [[Crown Dependency|UK Crown Dependencies]] [[Guernsey]] in 1983, [[Jersey]] in 1990 and [[Isle of Man]] in 1992.

The definition of sodomy was not specified in these or any statute, but rather established by judicial [[precedent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone]] |title=Halsbury's Laws of England|edition=4th|volume=11 |issue=1|page= 505|title-link=Halsbury's Laws of England}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years the courts have defined buggery as including either
# [[anal sex|anal intercourse]] or [[oral sex|oral intercourse]] by a man with a man or woman&lt;ref&gt;''R v Wiseman'' (1718) Fortes Rep 91.&lt;/ref&gt; or
# [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal intercourse]] by either [[Zoophilia|a man or a woman with an animal]],&lt;ref&gt;''R v Bourne'' (1952) 36 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 135; [[Edward Coke|Sir Edward Coke]] also reports (the almost certainly fictional) case of "... a great lady had committed buggery with a baboon and conceived by it..." at 3 Inst 59.&lt;/ref&gt;
but not any other form of "unnatural intercourse",&lt;ref name=RvJacobs&gt;{{cite book|title=Crown cases reserved for consideration: and decided by the Twelve judges of England, from the year 1799 to the year 1824|pages=331–332|year=1825|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bW0DAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA331|last=Russell|first=Sir William Oldnall}}&lt;/ref&gt; the implication being that anal sex with an animal would not constitute buggery. Such a case has not, to date, come before the courts of a common law jurisdiction in any reported decision. In the 1817 case of ''Rex v. Jacobs'', the Crown Court ruled that oral intercourse with a child aged 7 did not constitute sodomy.,&lt;ref name=RvJacobs /&gt; but it could still be prosecuted as an "attempt" to commit the felony.

At common law consent was not a defence&lt;ref&gt;Because consent was not required, heavier penalties require proof of lack of consent – see ''R v Sandhu'' [1997] [[Criminal Law Review|Crim LR]] 288; ''R v Davies'' [1998] 1 [[Criminal Appeal Reports (Sentencing)|Cr App R (S)]] 252.&lt;/ref&gt; nor was the fact that the parties were [[marriage|married]].&lt;ref&gt;''R v Jellyman'' (1838) 8 C &amp; P 604.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|UK]], the punishment for buggery was reduced from [[hanging]] to [[life imprisonment]] by the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]]. As with the crime of [[rape]], buggery required that penetration must have occurred, but [[ejaculation]] is not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Reekspear'' (1832) 1 Mood CC 342; ''R v Cozins'' (1834) 6 C &amp; P 351; the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], §63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Decriminalisation and abolition ====
{{main|LGBT rights in the United Kingdom#Same-sex sexual activity}}
In England, the first relaxation of the law came from the [[Wolfenden Report]], published in 1957. The key proposal of the report was that "homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cabinet Papers|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/before-after-wolfenden-report.htm|website=The National Archives|access-date=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the law was not changed until 1967, when the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]] decriminalised consensual "homosexual acts" as long as only two men were involved, both were over 21 and the acts happened in private. The Act concerned acts between men only, and anal sex between men and women remained an offence until 1994.

In the 1980s and 1990s, [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|gay rights]] organizations made attempts to equalize the [[age of consent]] for heterosexual and homosexual activity, which had previously been 21 for homosexual activity but only 16 for heterosexual acts. Efforts were also made to modify the "no other person present" clause so that it dealt only with minors. In 1994, Conservative MP [[Edwina Currie]] introduced an amendment to the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill]] which would have lowered the age of consent to 16. The amendment failed, but a compromise amendment which lowered the age of consent to 18 was accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Amendment Of Law Relating To Sexual Acts Between Men |url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1994-02-21/debates/2cff3a37-1689-4247-bfa8-3f2f3d5da45e/AmendmentOfLawRelatingTo |website=[[Hansard]] |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |access-date=7 November 2019 |date=21 February 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1 July 1997 decision in the case ''[[Sutherland v. United Kingdom]]'' resulted in the [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000]] which further reduced it to 16, and the "no other person present" clause was modified to "no minor persons present".

It was not until 2000, with the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000, that the age of consent for anal sex was reduced to 16 for men and women. In 2003, the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003|Sexual Offences Act]] significantly reformed English law in relation to sexual offences, introducing a new range of offences relating to underage and non-consensual sexual activity that were concerned with the act that occurred, rather than the sex or sexual orientation of those committing it.&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Paul|title=Buggery and Parliament, 1533–2017|ssrn=3155522}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buggery in as much as it related to sexual intercourse with animals ([[bestiality]]) remained untouched until the Sexual Offences Act 2003, when it was replaced with a new offence of "intercourse with an animal".&lt;ref name="johnson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 69, Sexual Offences Act 2003|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/69|website=[[Legislation.gov.uk]]|access-date=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the universal age of consent is 16 in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/2008/510/contents/made|title=Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 (Commencement) Order 2008|access-date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the United Kingdom on 2 February 2009 (prior to that, the age of consent for both heterosexual and homosexual intercourse was 17). The three British [[Crown dependencies]] also have an equal age of consent at 16: since 2006, in the [[Isle of Man]]; since 2007, in [[Jersey]]; and since 2010 in [[Guernsey]].

[[Sodomy laws in the United States]] were largely a matter of [[U.S. state|state]] rather than federal jurisdiction, except for laws governing the [[US Armed Forces]]. In the 1950s, all states had some form of law criminalizing sodomy. In the early 1960s, the penalties for sodomy in the various states varied from imprisonment for two to ten years and/or a fine of US$2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Don | last=Gilleland | title=50 years of change | url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20130103/COLUMNISTS0205/301030003/Guest-column-50-years-change| newspaper=Florida Today | location=Melbourne, Florida | pages= 9A | date=3 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Illinois]] became the first American jurisdiction to repeal its law against consensual sodomy in 1961; in 1962, the [[Model Penal Code]] recommended all states do so.&lt;ref name=canaday&gt;{{cite web | last = Canaday | first = Margot | title = We Colonials: Sodomy Laws in America | publisher = [[The Nation]] | date = 3 September 2008 | url = http://www.thenation.com/article/we-colonials-sodomy-laws-america | access-date = 7 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1986 ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'' decision upholding [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]'s sodomy law, the United States Supreme Court ruled that nothing in the United States Constitution bars a state from prohibiting sodomy.

By 2002, 36 states had repealed all sodomy laws or had them overturned by court rulings. In 2003, only 10 states had laws prohibiting all sodomy, with penalties ranging from 1 to 15 years imprisonment. Additionally, four other states had laws that specifically prohibited same-sex sodomy. On June 26, 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] in a 6–3 decision in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' struck down the [[Texas]] same-sex sodomy law, ruling that this private sexual conduct is protected by the liberty rights implicit in the [[Due process|due process clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]], with [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]'s concurring opinion arguing that they violated equal protection. This decision invalidated all [[U.S. state|state]] sodomy laws insofar as they applied to noncommercial conduct in private between consenting civilians.

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces|Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces]] has ruled that the ''Lawrence v. Texas'' decision applies to Article 125 of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], which is a ban on sodomy in the US Armed Forces. In both ''United States v. Stirewalt'' and ''[[United States v. Marcum]]'', the court ruled that the "conduct falls within the liberty interest identified by the Supreme Court",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| publisher= US Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces| url= http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/opinions/2004Term/03-0433.htm |title= U.S. v.

As of 2022, 14 states still had laws against consensual sodomy; in 2013, police in [[East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana]], arrested gay men for "attempted crimes against nature" despite the law having been ruled unconstitutional and unenforcable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/04/21/12-states-ban-sodomy-a-decade-after-court-ruling/7981025/|title=12 states still ban sodomy a decade after court ruling| work=USA Today|access-date=7 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimbabwe's Former President [[Robert Mugabe]] has waged a violent [[LGBT rights in Zimbabwe|campaign against homosexuals]], claiming that before colonization, Zimbabweans did not engage in homosexual acts.&lt;ref name="HOMO"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| url= | page= [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN030647770X&amp;id=ezBvVdRnWKsC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213&amp;ots=6IWk0seKwp&amp;dq=Mugabe+moral+campaign+homosexuality&amp;sig=tzSDUBuYv5c6Y8admBfF-Y-Azbo 213] | title= The Scientific Study of Homosexuality and Social Policy| encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender: Men and Women in the World's Cultures| first1= Carol R. |last1= Ember| first2= Melvin |last2= Ember| publisher= Springer | year= 2003| isbn= 9780306477706 | access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His first major public condemnation of homosexuality&lt;!-- Perhaps mention a couple of the subsequent ones to cite "the first"? --&gt; came during the [[Zimbabwe International Book Fair]] in August 1995.&lt;ref name="ZIB"&gt;{{cite book| first= Marc |last= Epprecht| isbn= 9780773527515 |url= | page= [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0773527516&amp;id=LvxMq2hNzm0C&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;ots=xI8D2NLVGn&amp;dq=Mugabe+moral+campaign+homosexuality&amp;sig=-81GDIVzFqwX10TbJjaRAXlT2TE#PPA180,M1 180] |title= Hungochani: The History of a Dissident Sexuality in Southern Africa| publisher= McGill-Queen's Press | year= 2004| access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He told the audience that homosexuality:

...degrades human dignity. It's unnatural and there is no question ever of allowing these people to behave worse than dogs and pigs. If dogs and pigs do not do it, why must human beings? We have our own culture, and we must re-dedicate ourselves to our traditional values that make us human beings... What we are being persuaded to accept is sub-animal behaviour and we will never allow it here. If you see people parading themselves as lesbians and gays, arrest them and hand them over to the police!&lt;ref name="GAYRANT"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.kaiwright.com/gayzimbabwe_more.php?id=101_0_25_0_M |title= Under African Skies, Part I: 'Totally unacceptable to cultural norms'| website= kaiwright.com| publisher= | date= |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060506142037/http://www.kaiwright.com/gayzimbabwe_more.php?id=101_0_25_0_M |archivedate=6 May 2006 | access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In September 1995, Zimbabwe's parliament introduced legislation banning homosexual acts.&lt;ref name="ZIB"/&gt; In 1997, a court found [[Canaan Banana]], Mugabe's predecessor and the first President of Zimbabwe, guilty of 11 counts of sodomy and indecent assault.&lt;ref name="BANANAtrial"&gt;{{cite book| page= [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN9042016264&amp;id=PFvYzAUheGkC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;ots=0hbU6n9tV1&amp;dq=Canaan+Banana+homosexual&amp;sig=2cfQK_-ufIaV-egJ-ob6Wfu2kkQ 93]| title= Body, Sexuality, and Gender | department= Vol. 1| first1= Flora |last1= Veit-Wild| first2= Dirk |last2= Naguschewski| publisher= Rodopi| year= 2005| isbn= 9789042016262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banana's trial proved embarrassing for Mugabe, when Banana's accusers alleged that Mugabe knew about Banana's conduct and had done nothing to stop it.&lt;ref name= "bananadeath"&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.theguardian.com/zimbabwe/article/0,2763,1082496,00.html |title= Canaan Banana, president jailed in sex scandal, dies| work= The Guardian| date= 10 November 2003| first= Andrew |last= Meldrum | location= Pretoria| publisher= | access-date= 30 September 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, Banana fled Zimbabwe only to return in 1999 and served one year in prison for his homosexual acts. Banana was also stripped of his priesthood.
