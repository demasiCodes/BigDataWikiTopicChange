The '''Human Rights Campaign''' ('''HRC''') is the largest [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) equal rights organizations in the [[United States]], with over 600,000 members. The HRC "envisions an America where [[LGBT|GLBT]] people are ensured of their basic equal rights, and can be open, honest and safe at home, at work and in the community." [http://www.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Section=About_HRC]

==Programs, Functions, and Actions of the HRC==
The Human Rights Campaign is a visible entity in U.S. [[politics]]. It lobbies [[United States Congress|Congress]] for support of LGBT-positive bills, works to build an LGBT-friendly Congress by funding those politicians that support the [[gay community|LGBT community]], mobilizes grassroots action amongst its members, and encourages members to employ their right to vote in every election. 

Through its website, the HRC also assists members in identifying [[state]] and local [[lawmaker]]s, researching state and local laws regarding issues central to LGBT causes, reviewing scorecards of how lawmakers rate on LGBT issues, and drafting and sending letters to lawmakers. 

Additionally, the HRC maintains information on how to [[come out]] and information about [[workplace]] issues (in the [[Corporate Equality Index]]).

==History and leadership==
The Human Rights Campaign Fund was established in [[1980]] by Steve Endean to raise money for [[gay]]-supportive congressional candidates. Within three months time, the HRC was registered with the [[Federal Election Commission]] as an independent [[political action committee]]. In [[1983]], Vic Basile, one of the leading [[LGBT]] rights activists in [[Washington, DC]] at the time, was elected as the first executive director. In October [[1986]], the HRC Foundation was formed. As with many gay organizations in the 1980s, HRC's membership was devastated by the onslaught of [[AIDS]] and they spent much of the decade struggling to hold their ground.

In January [[1989]], Basile announced his departure, and the HRC reorganized from serving mainly as a [[political action committee|PAC]] to becoming a lobbying and political organization. The purpose statement of the HRC became, "For the promotion of the social welfare of the gay and lesbian community by drafting, supporting and influencing legislation and policy at the federal, state and local level." Tim McFeeley, a graduate of [[Harvard Law]], and founder of the [[Boston Lesbian and Gay Political Alliance]] and a co-chair of the [[New England]] HRC Committee, was elected the new executive director. Total membership was then approximately 25,000 members.

In [[1992]], the HRC endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time &amp;mdash; [[Arkansas]] Governor [[Bill Clinton]]. In March [[1993]], [[National Coming Out Day]] became a project of the HRC. From January [[1995]] until January [[2004]], [[Elizabeth Birch]] served as the executive director of the HRC. Under her leadership, the institution more than quadrupled its membership to 500,000 members and purchased an office building for its Washington, DC headquarters. 

This building was purchased from [[B'nai B'rith|B'nai B'rith International]] in [[2002]] for $9.8 million. A large national capital campaign raised over $28 million for the renovation of the building. After over $10 million in renovations, the building is currently valued at over $18 million.

In August [[2000]], Birch became the first leader of an LGBT organization to address the convention of a major political party when she spoke before the [[Democratic National Convention]]. Her successor, [[Cheryl Jacques]], resigned in November [[2004]] after only 11 months as executive director. In a statement released by the organization, Jacques resigned over "a difference in management philosophy". Incidentally, Birch's partner, [[Hilary Rosen]], former chief executive of the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], was named as interim replacement.

On [[March 9]], [[2005]], the HRC announced the appointment of [[Joe Solmonese]] as the president, describing him as one of the "nation's most accomplished and respected progressive leaders".

The Human Rights Campaign also consists of a Board of Directors and a Board of Governors. The HRCF (Human Rights Campaign Foundation), a non-profit entity, also maintains a separate Board. In [[December 2004]], they named [[Michael Berman]] as their Board chair.

Its release was accompanied with signing events at the [[Times Square]] [[Virgin Megastores|Virgin Megastore]] in [[New York City]] and at the HRC Action Center in [[Washington, D.C.]]
