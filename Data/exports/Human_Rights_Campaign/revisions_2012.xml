The '''Human Rights Campaign''' ('''HRC''') is the largest [[LGBT]] equality-rights [[advocacy group]] and political [[lobbying]] organization in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2007-08-10/politics/gay.forum_1_lesbian-couples-gay-issues-human-rights-campaign-foundation?_s=PM:POLITICS|title=Democratic hopefuls pressed on gay issues at forum - CNN|date=10 August 2007|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the HRC, it has more than one million members and supporters.&lt;ref name=wwd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/the-hrc-story/about-us|title= The HRC Story|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
HRC is an umbrella group of two separate [[non-profit organization]]s and a [[political action committee]]: the HRC Foundation, a [[501(c)|501(c)(3)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HRC Foundation|url=http://www.hrc.org/the-hrc-story/hrc-foundation|work=hrc.org|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; organization that focuses on research, advocacy and education; the Human Rights Campaign, a [[501(c)|501(c)(4)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.hrc.org/support/frequently-asked-questions|work=hrc.org|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; organization that focuses on promoting the social welfare of gays and lesbians through lobbying Congress and state and local officials for support of pro-LGBT bills, and mobilizing grassroots action amongst its members; and the HRC Political Action Committee, which supports candidates that adhere to its positions on [[LGBT rights]].&lt;ref name=structure&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights Campaign Foundation|url=http://www.guidestar.org/PartnerReport.aspx?partner=justgivews&amp;ein=52-1481896|work=guidestar.org|publisher=[[GuideStar]]|accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mission&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Statement|url=http://www.hrc.org/the-hrc-story/mission-statement|work=hrc.org|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local activities are carried out by local steering committees, of which there are over 30 located throughout the United States.&lt;ref name=steeringcommittee&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Steering Committee?|url=http://www.hrc.org/blog/entry/what-is-a-steering-committee|work=hrc.org|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership===
The Human Rights Campaign’s leadership includes President [[Chad Griffin]] and Managing Director Susanne Salkind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harmon|first=Andrew|title=Chad Griffin Named President of HRC|url=http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2012/03/02/Chad_Griffin_Named_President_of_HRC/|accessdate=2 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Advocate]]|date=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work is supported by three boards: the Board of Directors, which is the governing body for the organization; the HRC Foundation Board, which manages the foundation’s finances and establishes official policies governing the foundation; and the Board of Governors, which manages the organization’s local outreach nationwide. All three boards comprise volunteers from across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The HRC Story: Boards|url=http://www.hrc.org/the-hrc-story/boards|work=hrc.org|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
The Human Rights Campaign's priorities include: prevention of [[hate crime]]s and [[HIV|HIV/AIDS]]; advocacy for healthcare benefits, [[same-sex marriage|marriage]], and adoption rights for same-sex couples; lobbying for a federal [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act]] (ENDA) and [[gender identity]] anti-discrimination laws; combating [[anti-gay bullying|gay bashing]] in schools; and building relationships with [[Straight ally|straight allies]], ethnic groups, religious leaders, and youth.&lt;ref name=issues&gt;{{cite web|title=Issues: Human Rights Campaign|url=http://www.hrc.org/issues|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HRC Foundation provides educational resources and publications on [[coming out]], transgender issues, LGBT-related healthcare topics and information about workplace issues faced by LGBT people, notably the [[Corporate Equality Index]]. It also maintains resources on LGBT parenting, religion and faith issues, immigration, and outreach for youth.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Campaign Foundation"&gt;[http://www.hrc.org/resources Resources]&lt;/ref&gt;

The HRC Foundation’s Coming Out Project provides information to people who are in the process of coming out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.org/resources/category/coming-out Resources: Coming Out]&lt;/ref&gt;

HRC lobbies for anti-discrimination, hate crimes laws, and worked on the passage of the [[Matthew Shepard Act|Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act]], which expanded federal hate-crime law to allow the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] to investigate and prosecute crimes motivated by a victim’s actual or perceived gender, [[sexual orientation]], gender identity, or disability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.org/sites/loveconquershate/about.asp HRC: Matthew Shepard Act]&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the law as a “historic milestone,” former HRC President [[Joe Solmonese]] said its passage represents “the first time that we as a nation have explicitly protected the LGBT community in the law.”&lt;ref name="President Barack Obama Signs Hate Crimes Legislation Into Law"&gt;[http://www.hrc.org/press-releases/entry/president-barack-obama-signs-hate-crimes-legislation-into-law President Barack Obama Signs Hate Crimes Legislation Into Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's work on health issues traditionally focused on responding to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In recent years, HRC has addressed discrimination in health care settings for LGBT employees, patients and their families. Since 2007, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation has published the "Healthcare Equality Index", which rates hospitals on issues such as patient and employee non-discrimination policies, employee [[cultural competence|cultural competency]] training, and hospital visitation rights for LGBT patients' families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/healthcare-equality-index-2011 Resources: Healthcare Equality Index]&lt;/ref&gt; Lobbyists from the Human Rights Campaign worked with the [[Barack Obama|Obama administration]] to extend hospital visitation rights to same-sex partners.&lt;ref name="Obama extends hospital visitation rights to same-sex partners of gays"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/15/AR2010041505502.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Michael D. | last=Shear | title=Obama extends hospital visitation rights to same-sex partners of gays | date=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HRC lobbied extensively for the repeal of the [[Don't Ask Don't Tell]] (DADT) law, which barred gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the United States military. [[Eric Alva]], a gay Marine who was the first American wounded in [[Iraq War|combat in Iraq]], has since been a spokesman on behalf of the Human Rights Campaign's efforts to repeal the law, and was invited to stand behind President Obama at the signing ceremony.&lt;ref name="Obama signs DADT repeal before big, emotional crowd"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/22/AR2010122201888.html | work=The Washington Post | first1=William | last1=Branigin | first2=Debbi | last2=Wilgoren | first3=Perry | last3=Bacon Jr | title=Obama signs DADT repeal before big, emotional crowd | date=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, HRC spent $3.5 million on lobbying, its largest one-year expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000000158&amp;year=2004 "Human Rights Campaign"], OpenSecrets.org. Retrieved 16 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; That year, the organization worked to prevent an [[Federal Marriage Amendment|amendment]] to the [[U.S. Constitution]] which would have limited marriage to unions of one man and one woman, and prevented judicial extension of [[same-sex marriage in the United States|marriage rights]] to same-sex couples. It typically spends over $1 million per year on lobbying, ranking among the biggest spenders on lobbying for [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/indusclient.php?id=Q09&amp;year=2011 OpenSecrets.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Human Right Campaign headquarters.JPG|thumb|Human Rights Campaign headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
[[Steve Endean]], who had worked with a previously established [[Gay Rights National Lobby]] from 1978, established the Human Rights Campaign Fund [[political action committee]] in 1980 to raise money for gay-supportive congressional candidates. In 1983, [[Vic Basile]], at the time one of the leading LGBT rights activists in Washington, D.C., was elected as the first executive director. In October 1986, the HRC Foundation (HRCF) was formed as a non-profit organization.&lt;ref name=Bailey-history /&gt;

In January 1989, Basile announced his departure, and HRC reorganized from serving mainly as a political action committee (PAC) to broadening its function to encompass lobbying, research, education, and media outreach.&lt;ref name=HRCJournal-history&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birch|first=Elizabeth|title=The Human Rights Campaign: So Much More Than a Fund.|year=HRC Quarterly (Fall 1995)|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|pages=2–3|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/human_rights_campaign.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; HRC decided on a new Statement of Purpose:
{{cquote|For the promotion of the social welfare of the gay and lesbian community by drafting, supporting and influencing legislation and policy at the federal, state and local level.}}
[[Tim McFeeley]], a [[Harvard Law School]] graduate, founder of the Boston Lesbian and Gay Political Alliance, and a co-chair of the [[New England]] HRC Committee, was elected the new executive director. Total membership was then approximately 25,000 members.&lt;ref name=Bailey-history&gt;{{cite book|last=Bailey|first=Mark|title="Human Rights Campaign." Gay Histories and Cultures|year=2000|publisher=Garland|location=New York|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/human_rights_campaign.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, HRC endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time, [[Bill Clinton]]. In March 1993, HRC began a new project, [[National Coming Out Day]]. From January 1995 until January 2004, [[Elizabeth Birch]] served as the executive director of the HRC. Under her leadership, the institution more than quadrupled its membership to 500,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Althafer|first=Emily|title=Leading gay rights advocate to speak at UF|url=http://news.ufl.edu/2006/01/23/human-rights-talk/|publisher=University of Florida News: source: Adelisse Fontanet, xxx-1665 ext. 326|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the organization dropped the word “Fund” from its name, becoming the Human Rights Campaign. That same year, it underwent a complete reorganization. The HRC Foundation added new programs such as the Workplace Project and the Family Project, while HRC itself broadly expanded its research, communications, and marketing/public relations functions. The organization also unveiled a new [[logo]], a yellow equal sign inside of a blue square, which has become one of the most recognizable symbols in the [[LGBT]] community.&lt;ref name="HRC Logo"&gt;{{cite web|title=The HRC Story: About Our Logo|url=http://www.hrc.org/the-hrc-story/about-our-logo|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, HRC purchased a headquarters building in [[Washington, D.C]].
[[Image:ChicagoGayPride2005 1.jpg|thumb|The Human Rights Campaign often has a large presence at LGBT-related events such as the [[Chicago Pride Parade]] as seen above.]]
As part of the activities surrounding the [[Millennium March on Washington]], the HRC Foundation sponsored a fundraising concert at Washington, D.C.'s [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]] on 29 April 2000. Billed as a concert to end hate crimes, "Equality Rocks" honored hate crime victims and their families, such as featured speakers Dennis and [[Judy Shepard]], the parents of [[Matthew Shepard]]. More than 45,000 people&lt;ref name="concert-hate crimes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Resources: Hate Crimes Timeline|url=http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/hate-crimes-timeline#2000|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; attended the event, which included [[Melissa Etheridge]], [[Garth Brooks]], [[Pet Shop Boys]], [[k.d. lang]], [[Nathan Lane]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], [[Albita Rodríguez]], and [[Chaka Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More Artists Added to Equality Rocks:  Michael Feinstein, Chaka Khan, Kathy Najimy and Rufus Wainwright Join Garth Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, Melissa Etheridge, Anne Heche, Kristen Johnston, kd lang, Nathan Lane and Pet Shop Boys To Benefit the Human Rights Campaign Foundation|url=http://www.nyrock.com/worldbeat/04_2000/041200a.asp|publisher=nyrock.com World Beat|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth Birch's successor, [[Cheryl Jacques]], resigned in November 2004 after only 11 months as executive director. In a statement released by HRC, Jacques said she had resigned over "a difference in management philosophy".&lt;ref name="Jacques Press Release"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheryl Jacques to Leave Human Rights Campaign: HRC Boards Put Transition Plan in Place|url=http://www.hrc.org/press-releases/entry/cheryl-jacques-to-leave-human-rights-campaign|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 2005, HRC announced the appointment of Joe Solmonese as the president, describing him as having an "unrivaled track record at the nation's foremost progressive electoral powerhouse" and appealing to "Americans across the political and ideological spectrum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joe Solmonese Named Human Rights Campaign President: Leader with Unmatched Record to Embark on Heartland Tour during First Week on Job|url=http://www.hrc.org/press-releases/entry/joe-solmonese-named-human-rights-campaign-president|accessdate=22 February 2012|newspaper=Human Rights Campaign|date=9 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HRC launched its Religion and Faith Program in 2005 to mobilize clergy to advocate for LGBT people, and helped form DC Clergy United for Marriage Equality, which was involved in the legalization of [[same-sex marriage in the District of Columbia]].&lt;ref name="Fenty to sign same-sex marriage bill at church in NW D.C."&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/17/AR2009121704330.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Nikita | last=Stewart | title=Fenty to sign same-sex marriage bill at church in NW D.C | date=18 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 March 2010, the first legally recognized same-sex weddings in the [[District of Columbia]] were held at the headquarters of the Human Rights Campaign.&lt;ref name="First gay marriages in District performed"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/09/AR2010030901904.html | work=The Washington Post | first1=Ann E. | last1=Marimow | first2=Keith L. | last2=Alexander | title=First gay marriages in District performed | date=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 August 2007, HRC and [[Logo (TV channel)|Logo TV]] co-hosted a forum for 2008 Democratic presidential candidates dedicated specifically to LGBT issues.&lt;ref name="Dems Court the Gay Vote"&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Story?id=3466074&amp;page=1 Dems Court the Gay Vote]&lt;/ref&gt;

HRC spent over $7 million in its "Year to Win" campaign during the [[United States elections, 2008|2008 elections]], the largest electoral campaign in its history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.org/the-hrc-story/our-victories Our victo: Year to Win]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2008 election"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Victories (Election Heavyweights section)|url=http://www.hrc.org/the-hrc-story/our-victories|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, HRC lobbied for the repeal of the United States' ban on [[HIV-positive]] people's entry into the country for travel or immigration, stating the need to "combat the stigma and ignorance that still too often guides public policy debates around HIV/AIDS."&lt;ref name="Ban Lifted"&gt;{{cite web|title=After 22 Years, HIV Travel and Immigration Ban Lifted|url=http://www.hrc.org/press-releases/entry/after-22-years-hiv-travel-and-immigration-ban-lifted|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="After 22 years, HIV travel and immigration ban lifted"&gt;[http://miamiherald.typepad.com/gaysouthflorida/2010/01/hrc-after-22-years-hiv-travel-and-immigration-ban-lifted.html#ixzz0sxMtcovD Miami Herald: After 22 years, HIV travel and immigration ban lifted]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, it was announced that Solmonese would step down from the presidency following the end of his contract in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://metroweekly.com/poliglot/2011/08/hrcs-solmonese-to-step-down.html|title = HRC's Solmonese to Step Down, Sources Say No Replacement Has Been Selected|author = Chris Geidner |date = 27 August 2011&lt;!-- 3:20 AM--&gt;|publisher = Metro Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite initial speculation that former Atlanta City Council president [[Cathy Woolard]] would be appointed, no replacement was announced until 2 March 2012, when [[American Foundation for Equal Rights]] co-founder [[Chad Griffin]] was announced as Solmonese's successor. Griffin took office on 11 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2012/03/02/Chad_Griffin_Named_President_of_HRC/|title = Chad Griffin Named President of HRC|date = 2 March 2012&lt;!-- 10:59:03 AM ET--&gt;|author = Andrew Harmon|publisher = The Advocate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Annual fundraisers===
Each year since 1997, HRC has hosted a national dinner that features high-profile speakers and serves as the organization’s single largest annual fundraiser. In 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] addressed a crowd of approximately 3,000 guests&lt;ref name="dinner guests"&gt;{{cite web|title=Program Book|url=http://www.hrcnationaldinner.org/programbook/|publisher=HRCNationalDinner.org|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   at HRC’s 13th Annual National Dinner. In his speech, President Obama reaffirmed his pledge to repeal “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” and the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA), as well as his commitment to passing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.&lt;ref name="Huffington Post – Obama HRC Speech"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/10/obama-says-he-will-end-do_n_316524.html Huffington Post – Obama HRC Speech]&lt;/ref&gt; Other featured speakers at past dinners have included Bill Clinton, Betty DeGeneres, [[Maya Angelou]], [[Kweisi Mfume]], [[Joseph Lieberman]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Richard Gephardt]], [[John Lewis (U.S. politician)|John Lewis]], [[Rosie O'Donnell]], [[Nancy Pelosi]] and [[Tim Gunn]], and [[Suze Orman]].&lt;ref name="previous dinners"&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Dinner: Previous Dinners|url=http://www.hrcnationaldinner.org/about/|publisher=hrcnationaldinner.org|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HRC historical records===
The historical records of the Human Rights Campaign are maintained in a collection at the [[Cornell University Library]]. Arriving at Cornell in 2004, the records include [[strategic planning]] documents, faxes, minutes, e-mails, press releases, posters, and campaign buttons. Taking up {{convert|84|cuft|m3}}, the archive is the second largest in the library's [[Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Human Sexuality Collection]]. In February 2007, the archive was opened to scholars at the library, and selected records were organized into an online exhibit called "25 Years of Political Influence: The Records of the Human Rights Campaign."&lt;ref&gt;Lowery, George.

==Logo==
The current logo of the HRC, adopted in 1995, consists of a yellow [[equals sign]] imposed onto a blue background. The logo was created in 1995 by Stone Yamashita, who attracted then-Executive Director Elizabeth Birch to its bold design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hrc.org/the-hrc-story/about-our-logo|title = About Our Logo|publisher = Human Rights Campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous logo used by the HRC (then known as the HRCF) featured a stylized flaming torch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/HRC/exhibition/images/570pxw/REX023_091.jpg|title = Old HRCF logo on lapel|publisher = Cornell University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics of the HRC have accused the organization of favoring the Democratic Party. [[Andrew Sullivan]], a conservative gay political columnist and blogger who endorsed [[George W. Bush]] in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.openleft.com/diary/15262/public-option-andrew-sullivan-as-weather-vane&lt;/ref&gt; has been critical of the HRC, calling it "a patronage wing of the Democratic party".&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Andrew.

HRC's endorsement of New York Republican [[Al D'Amato]] in his 1998 campaign for re-election to the U.S. Senate brought more criticism. HRC defended the endorsement because of D’Amato's support for [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act|ENDA]] and repeal of [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]. However, many liberal LGBT leaders did not welcome D'Amato's many conservative stances, including his opposition to affirmative action and abortion rights.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, Charles.

[[Barney Frank]], HRC officially neither opposed nor supported it.&lt;ref name=rose&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid49565.asp|title=Donna Rose on Why She Resigned as the Only Transgender Member of HRC's Board|date=4 October 2007|accessdate=8 August 2009|publisher=[[The Advocate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed a speech by former HRC President Joe Solmonese at the transgender [[Southern Comfort Conference]] the previous month, where he said that HRC "oppose[d] any legislation that is not absolutely inclusive."&lt;ref name=solomonese&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.edgesanfrancisco.com/index.php?ch=news&amp;sc=glbt&amp;sc2=features&amp;sc3=&amp;id=77775|title=HRC’s ENDA dilemma: Dine, party or boycott?|date=22 July 2008|accessdate=25 March 2011|publisher=[[EDGE Publications, Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; HRC later explained it could not actively support a non-inclusive bill, but did not oppose it because the legislation would strategically advance long-term efforts to pass a trans-inclusive ENDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sandeen|first=Autumn|title=ENDA Passed Without "Real Or Perceived Gender" Protections|url=http://pamshouseblend.firedoglake.com/2007/11/07/enda-passed-without-real-or-perceived-gender-protections/|publisher=pamhouseblend.com|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a letter to [[U.S. Representatives]], HRC did express support for the bill, stating that while HRC is "greatly disappointed that the current version of ENDA is not fully-inclusive...we appreciate the steadfast efforts of our...allies...even when they are forced...to make progress that is measured by inches rather than yards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pamspaulding.com/graphics/LCCR_ENDA_%20Letter.pdf "Letter to U.S. Representatives"]&lt;/ref&gt; 

LGBT activists were disappointed when HRC leaders announced that it would consider softening demands for equal rights and make political bargains, such as supporting President George W. Bush's plan to privatize [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] partly in exchange for the right of same-sex partners to receive benefits under the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/09/national/09gays.html|title=Groups Debate Slower Strategy on Gay Rights|publisher=''New York Times''|accessdate=24 November 2007|author=John M.

HRC's involvement in the Catholic gay community has been criticized by the Rainbow Sash Movement, according to GLTNEWSNOW.&lt;ref&gt;http://gltnewsnow.com/2010/09/08/catholics-for-equality-sincere/ GLTNEWSNOW.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the radical queer collective [[Against Equality]] is critical of HRC's mainstream politics.

Public health researchers have been critical of HRC for giving a perfect score on the 2009 Corporate Equality Index to [[Reynolds American]], the parent company of [[R.J. Reynolds Tobacco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.q-notes.com/2009/03/21/stamp-of-approval/|title=Stamp of Approval: Gay researcher questions Human Rights Campaign’s perfect rating of Reynolds Tobacco Co.|publisher=''Q-Notes''|accessdate=29 March 2009|author=Matt Comer| date= 21 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these researchers maintain that the large [[health disparities]] in tobacco use&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19208668 Tobacco use among sexual minorities in the USA, 1987 to May 2007: a systematic review.] ''Tobacco Control'' Online First 11 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; caused by targeted marketing, including the company's marketing plan from the 1990s called [[Project SCUM]] (for "Subculture Urban Marketing"), undermine the LGBT cause.
