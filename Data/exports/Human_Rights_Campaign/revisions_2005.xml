The '''Human Rights Campaign''' ('''HRC''') is one of the largest [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) equal rights organization in the [[United States]]. The HRC "envisions an America where [[LGBT]] people are ensured of their basic equal rights, and can be open, honest and safe at home, at work and in the community." [http://www.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Section=About_HRC]

==Actions of the HRC==
The Human Rights Campaign is a visible entity in U.S. [[politics]]. It lobbies [[United States Congress|Congress]] for support of LGBT-positive bills, works to build an LGBT-friendly Congress by funding those politicians that support the [[gay community|LGBT community]], mobilizes grassroots action amongst its members, and encourages members to employ their right to vote in every election. Through its website, the HRC also assists members in identifying [[state]] and local [[lawmaker]]s, researching state and local laws regarding issues central to the LGBT cause, reviewing scorecards of how lawmakers rate on LGBT issues, and drafting and sending letters to lawmakers.

==History and leadership==
The Human Rights Campaign Fund was established in [[1980]] by Steve Endean to raise money for [[gay]]-supportive congressional candidates. Within three months time, the HRC was registered with the [[Federal Election Commission]] as an independent [[political action committee]]. In [[1983]], Vic Basile, one of the leading [[LGBT]] rights activists in [[Washington, DC]] at the time, was elected as the first executive director. In [[October]] [[1986]], the HRC Foundation was formed. As with many gay organizations in the 1980s, HRC's membership was devasted by the onslaught of [[AIDS]] and they spent much of the decade struggling to hold their ground.

In [[January]] [[1989]], Basile announced his departure, and the HRC reorganized from serving mainly as a [[political action committee|PAC]] to becoming a lobbying and political organization. The purpose statement of the HRC became, "For the promotion of the social welfare of the gay and lesbian community by drafting, supporting and influencing legislation and policy at the federal, state and local level." Tim McFeeley, a graduate of [[Harvard Law]], and founder of the [[Boston Lesbian and Gay Political Alliance]] and a co-chair of the [[New England]] HRC Committee, was elected the new executive director. Total membership was then approximately 25,000 members.

In [[1992]], the HRC endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time &amp;mdash; [[Arkansas]] Governor [[Bill Clinton]]. In [[March]] [[1993]], [[National Coming Out Day]] became a project of the HRC. From [[January]] [[1995]] until January [[2004]], [[Elizabeth Birch]] served as the executive director of the HRC. Under her leadership, the institution more than quadrupled its membership to 500,000 members and purchased an office building for its Washington, DC headquarters. 

This building was purchased from [[B'nai B'rith|B'nai B'rith International]] in [[2002]] for $9.8 million. A large national capital campaign raised over $28 million for the renovation of the building. After over $10 million in renovations, the building is currently valued at over $18 million.

In [[August]] [[2000]], Birch became the first leader of an LGBT organization to address the convention of a major political party when she spoke before the [[Democratic National Convention]]. Her successor, [[Cheryl Jacques]], resigned in [[November]] [[2004]] after only 11 months as executive director. In a statement released by the organization, Jacques resigned over "a difference in management philosophy". Incidentally, Birch's partner, [[Hilary Rosen]], former chief executive of the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], was named as interim replacement.

On [[March 9]], [[2005]], the HRC announced the appointment of [[Joe Solmonese]] as the president, describing him as one of the "nation's most accomplished and respected progressive leaders".

The Human Rights Campaign also consists of a Board of Directors and a Board of Governors. The HRCF (Human Rights Campaign Foundation), a non-profit entity, also maintains a separate Board. In [[December 2004]], they named [[Michael Berman]] as their Board chair.

==Controversies==
Officially, the HRC represents the [[transgender]] community. However, it has previously been the target of protests once due to its refusal to demand the inclusion of the transgendered in the [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act]] (ENDA) bill. These objections changed in [[2004]] when the organization announced support for an ENDA bill that was inclusive of gender identity, however sparking charges of "trans-jacking" from the far right.

Sometimes referred to as "Headed by Rich Caucasians" or the "Human Rights Champagne Fund", the HRC has often been the target of critics who claim that the HRC and HRCF do not produce any significant policy advocacy, and only serve the interests of a select minority of wealthy, white gay men. In the same vein, it is heavily criticized for its national, top-down structure instead of a local, [[grassroots]] focus.

The HRC is considered by some to be too cozy with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] establishment. For example, during the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 election]]s, the bulk of the organizations time and funding was focused on the unsuccessful effort to elect [[John Kerry]]. ("[[George W. Bush]], You're Fired!" became the group's heavily merchandized signature line). As a result resources were not spent to defeat state [[ballot initiative]]s that sought to ban [[same-sex marriage]] &amp;mdash; all 11 of which passed overwhelmingly on [[November 2]], [[2004]]. Given that Kerry was a supporter of such state ballot initiatives [http://www.washblade.com/2004/8-13/news/national/kerryback.cfm], many questioned why he had received a "free ride" from HRC, and why more effort wasn't made to defeat the marriage initiatives.

==''Being Out Rocks''==
In [[2002]], the Human Rights Campaign, in collaboration with [[Centaur Entertainment]], released an awareness album named ''Being Out Rocks''. It was released on [[October 11]], 2002 to celebrate [[National Coming Out Day]] that year. It features a cross-section of [[LGBT]] and gay-supportive straight artists.
