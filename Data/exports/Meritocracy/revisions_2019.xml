'''Meritocracy''' (''merit'', from [[Latin]] ''mereō'', and ''-cracy'', from [[Ancient Greek]] κράτος ''{{transl|el|kratos}}''  'strength, power') is a political system in which [[economic goods]] and/or [[political power]] are vested in [[individual]] people on the basis of talent, effort, and achievement, rather than wealth or [[social class]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=meritocracy |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/meritocracy?s=t |website=[[Dictionary.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advancement in such a system is based on performance, as measured through examination or demonstrated achievement. Although the concept of meritocracy has existed for centuries, the term itself was coined in 1958 by the sociologist [[Michael Dunlop Young]] in his satirical essay ''[[The Rise of the Meritocracy]]''.&lt;ref name="Fox"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fox |first=Margalit |date=25 January 2002 |title=Michael Young, 86, Scholar; Coined, Mocked 'Meritocracy'|work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/25/world/michael-young-86-scholar-coined-mocked-meritocracy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
===Early definitions===
The "most common definition of meritocracy conceptualizes merit in terms of tested competency and ability, and most likely, as measured by [[IQ]] or standardized achievement tests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levinson|first=David|last2=Cookson|first2=Peter W.|last3=Sadovnik|first3=Alan R.|title=Education and Sociology: An Encyclopedia|year=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=436|quote=most common definition of meritocracy conceptualizes merit in terms tested competency and power, and most likely as measured by IQ or standardized achievement tests}}&lt;/ref&gt; In government and other administrative systems, "meritocracy" refers to a system under which advancement within the system turns on "merits", like performance, intelligence, [[credential]]s, and education. These are often determined through evaluations or examinations.{{sfnp|Young|1958}}{{Page needed|date=May 2019}}

In a more general sense, meritocracy can refer to any form of evaluation based on achievement. Like "[[utilitarian]]" and "[[Pragmatism|pragmatic]]", the word "meritocratic" has also developed a broader connotation, and is sometimes used to refer to any government run by "a ruling or influential class of educated or able people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/meritocracy|title=Definition of Meritocracy|work=Oxford Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is in contrast to the original, condemnatory use of the term in 1958 by [[Michael Dunlop Young]] in his work "''[[The Rise of the Meritocracy]]''", who was satirizing the ostensibly merit-based [[Tripartite System]] of education practiced in the United Kingdom at the time; he claimed that, in the Tripartite System, "merit is equated with intelligence-plus-effort, its possessors are identified at an early age and selected for appropriate intensive education, and there is an obsession with quantification, test-scoring, and qualifications."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought|year=1988|publisher=Fontana Press|page=521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meritocracy in its wider sense, may be any general act of judgment upon the basis of various demonstrated merits; such acts frequently are described in [[sociology]] and [[psychology]]. Supporters of meritocracy do not necessarily agree on the nature of "merit"; however, they do tend to agree that "merit" itself should be a primary consideration during evaluation. Thus, the merits may extend beyond intelligence and education to any mental or physical [[wikt:talent#Noun|talent]] or to [[work ethic]]. As such meritocracy may be based on [[moral character]] or innate abilities such as [[intelligence]].

In [[rhetoric]], the demonstration of one's merit regarding mastery of a particular subject is an essential task most directly related to the Aristotelian term ''[[Ethos]]''. The equivalent Aristotelian conception of meritocracy is based upon [[aristocratic]] or [[oligarchic]] structures, rather than in the context of the modern [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristot. Pol. 2.1261b&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, (351 BC) ''Politics''. Book Three Part IV. (Jowett, B., Trans)&lt;/ref&gt;

===More recent definitions===

In the United States, the assassination of President [[James A. Garfield]] in 1881 prompted the replacement of the American [[Spoils System]] with a meritocracy. In 1883, The [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]] was passed, stipulating government jobs should be awarded on the basis of merit through competitive exams, rather than ties to politicians or political affiliation.&lt;ref name="penl" /&gt;

The most common form of meritocratic screening found today is the college degree. Higher education is an imperfect meritocratic screening system for various reasons, such as lack of uniform standards worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;What's College For?: The Struggle To Define American Higher Education; Zachary Karabell; {{ISBN|978-0-465-09152-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Journal of College Teaching &amp; Learning – May 2008 Volume 5, Number 5 AACSB Accreditation&lt;/ref&gt; lack of scope (not all occupations and processes are included), and lack of access (some talented people never have an opportunity to participate because of the expense, most especially in [[developing country|developing countries]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Higher education and social justice |author1=Furlong, Andy|author2=Cartmel, Fred|isbn=978-0-335-22362-6|publisher=Open University Press|location =Maidenhead|date=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, academic degrees serve some amount of meritocratic screening purpose in the absence of a more refined methodology. Education alone, however, does not constitute a complete system, as meritocracy must automatically confer power and authority, which a degree does not accomplish independently.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

==Etymology==
Although the concept has existed for centuries, the term "meritocracy" is relatively new. It was used pejoratively by British politician and sociologist Michael Dunlop Young in his 1958 satirical essay&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Down with meritocracy: The man who coined the word four decades ago wishes Tony Blair would stop using it|last=Young|first=Michael|date=29 June 2001|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/29/comment|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ford, Boris|year=1992|title=The Cambridge cultural history of Britain|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=34|isbn=978-0-521-42889-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kamolnick, Paul|year=2005|title=The just meritocracy: IQ, class mobility, and American social policy|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport CT|page=87|isbn=978-0-275-97922-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Best, Shaun|year=2005|title=Understanding Social Divisions|publisher=Sage|page=32|location=London|isbn=978-0-7619-4296-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rise of the Meritocracy'', which pictured the United Kingdom under the rule of a government favouring intelligence and aptitude (merit) above all else, being the combination of the root of Latin origin "merit" (from "mereō" meaning "earn") and the Ancient Greek suffix "-cracy" (meaning "power", "rule").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=meritocracy|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|accessdate=3 July 2013|title="meritocracy" in the Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The ''purely'' Greek word is axiocracy (αξιοκρατία), from axios (αξιος, worthy) + "-cracy" (-κρατία, power).)
In this book the term had distinctly negative connotations as Young questioned both the legitimacy of the selection process used to become a member of this elite and the outcomes of being ruled by such a narrowly defined group.
The essay, written in the first person by a fictional historical narrator in 2034, interweaves history from the politics of pre- and post-war Britain with those of fictional future events in the short (1960 onward) and long term (2020 onward).&lt;ref name="Young 1958"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Young |first=Michael |title=The rise of the meritocracy, 1870-2033: An essay on education and inequality |date=1958 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location=London |oclc=3943639 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essay was based upon the tendency of the then-current governments, in their striving toward intelligence, to ignore shortcomings and upon the failure of education systems to utilize correctly the gifted and talented members within their societies.{{sfnp|Young|1958|p=13}}

Young's fictional narrator explains that, on the one hand, the greatest contributor to society is not the "stolid mass" or majority, but the "creative minority" or members of the "restless elite".{{sfnp|Young|1958|p=15}} On the other hand, he claims that there are casualties of progress whose influence is underestimated and that, from such stolid adherence to natural science and intelligence, arises arrogance and complacency.{{sfnp|Young|1958|p=15}} This problem is encapsulated in the phrase "Every selection of one is a rejection of many".{{sfnp|Young|1958|p=15}}

It was also used by [[Hannah Arendt]] in her essay "Crisis in Education",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.instituteofideas.com/documents/PGF_Arendt_Education.pdf "Crisis in Education"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014030134/http://www.instituteofideas.com/documents/PGF_Arendt_Education.pdf |date=14 October 2013 }} (p. 4).&lt;/ref&gt; which was written in 1958 and refers to the use of meritocracy in the English educational system.  She too uses the term pejoratively.  It was not until 1972 that [[Daniel Bell]] used the term positively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Littler|first1=Jo|title=Meritocracy: the great delusion that ingrains inequality|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/20/meritocracy-inequality-theresa-may-donald-trump|accessdate=14 July 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient times: China===
{{further|Chinese Legalism}}
According to scholarly consensus, the earliest example of an administrative meritocracy, based on civil service examinations, dates back to Ancient China.&lt;ref name="APHq"&gt;Kazin, Edwards, and Rothman (2010), 142. ''One of the oldest examples of a merit-based civil service system existed in the imperial bureaucracy of China.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tan|first=Chung|first2=Yinzheng|last2=Geng|title= India and China: twenty centuries of civilization interaction and vibrations|year=2005|publisher=University of Michigan Press|page=128|quote=China not only produced the world's first "bureaucracy", but also the world's first "meritocracy"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Konner|first=Melvin|title=Unsettled: an anthropology of the Jews|url=https://archive.org/details/unsettledanthrop00konn|url-access=registration|year=2003|publisher=Viking Compass|page=[https://archive.org/details/unsettledanthrop00konn/page/217 217]|quote=China is the world's oldest meritocracy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tucker|first1=Mary Evelyn|year=2009|title=Touching the Depths of Things: Cultivating Nature in East Asia|journal=Ecology and the Environment: Perspectives from the Humanities|page=51|publisher=[[Harvard Divinity School]]|quote=To staff these institutions, they created the oldest meritocracy in the world, in which government appointments were based on civil service examinations that drew on the values of the Confucian Classics}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=fna}} The concept originates, at least by the sixth century BC, when it was advocated by the Chinese philosopher [[Confucius]], who "invented the notion that those who govern should do so because of merit, not of inherited status. This sets in motion the creation of the imperial examinations and bureaucracies open only to those who passed tests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sienkewicz|first=Thomas J.|title=Encyclopedia of the Ancient World|year=2003|publisher=Salem Press|page=434|quote=Confucius invented the notion that those who govern should so because of merit and not inherited status, setting in motion the creation of the imperial examinations and bureaucracies open only to those who passed tests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Qin and Han dynasties developed a meritocratic system in order to maintain power over a large, sprawling empire, it became necessary for the government to maintain a complex network of officials.&lt;ref name="BC" /&gt; Prospective officials could come from a rural background and government positions were not restricted to the nobility. Rank was determined by merit, through the [[civil service examination]]s, and education became the key for social mobility.&lt;ref name="BC"&gt;Burbank and Cooper (2010), 51.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Han Dynasty, the [[nine-rank system]] was established during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period.

According to the [[Princeton Encyclopedia on American History]]:&lt;ref name="APH"&gt;Kazin, Edwards, and Rothman (2010), 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|One of the oldest examples of a merit-based civil service system existed in the imperial bureaucracy of China. Tracing back to 200 B.C., the Han Dynasty adopted [[Confucianism]] as the basis of its political philosophy and structure, which included the revolutionary idea of replacing nobility of blood with one of virtue and honesty, and thereby calling for administrative appointments to be based solely on merit. This system allowed anyone who passed an examination to become a government officer, a position that would bring wealth and honor to the whole family. In part due to Chinese influence, the first European civil service did not originate in Europe, but rather in India by the British-run East India Company... company managers hired and promoted employees based on competitive examinations in order to prevent corruption and favoritism.}}

Both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] advocated meritocracy, Plato in his ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', arguing that the wisest should rule, and hence the rulers should be [[philosopher king]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See Estlund (2003) for a summary and discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century: spread to Europe===
The concept of meritocracy spread from China to British India during the seventeenth century, and then into continental Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name="APH"/&gt; With the translation of Confucian texts during the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the concept of a meritocracy reached intellectuals in the West, who saw it as an alternative to the traditional ''[[ancient regime]]'' of Europe.&lt;ref name="EE"&gt;Schwarz (1996), 229&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voltaire]] and [[François Quesnay]] wrote favourably of the idea, with Voltaire claiming that the Chinese had "perfected moral science" and Quesnay advocating an economic and political system modeled after that of the Chinese.&lt;ref name="EE" /&gt;

The first European power to implement a successful meritocratic civil service was the [[British Empire]], in their administration of India: "company managers hired and promoted employees based on competitive examinations in order to prevent corruption and favoritism."&lt;ref name="APH"/&gt; British colonial administrators advocated the spread of the system to the rest of the commonwealth, the most "persistent" of which was Thomas Taylor Meadows, Britain's consul in [[Guangzhou]], [[China]]. Meadows successfully argued in his ''[[Desultory Notes on the Government and People of China]]'', published in 1847, that "the long duration of the Chinese empire is solely and altogether owing to the good government which consists in the advancement of men of talent and merit only," and that the British must reform their civil service by making the institution meritocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bodde|first=Derke|title=China: A Teaching Workbook|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/song/readings/inventions_ideas.htm|publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice later was adopted in the late nineteenth century by the British mainland, inspired by the "Chinese mandarin system".&lt;ref name="MB"&gt;Huddleston, Mark W. Boyer, William W.''The higher civil service in the United States: quest for reform''. (University of Pittsburgh Press, 1996), 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British philosopher and polymath [[John Stuart Mill]] advocated meritocracy in his book, ''[[Considerations on Representative Government]]''. His model was to give more votes to the more [[educated]] voter. His views are explained in Estlund (2003:57–58):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Mill's proposal of plural voting has two motives. One is to prevent one group or class of people from being able to control the political process even without having to give reasons in order to gain sufficient support. He calls this the problem of class legislation. Since the most numerous class is also at a lower level of education and social rank, this could be partly remedied by giving those at the higher ranks plural votes. A second, and equally prominent motive for plural voting is to avoid giving equal influence to each person without regard to their merit, intelligence, etc. He thinks that it is fundamentally important that political institutions embody, in their spirit, the recognition that some opinions are worth more than others. He does not say that this is a route to producing better political decisions, but it is hard to understand his argument, based on this second motive, in any other way.

So, if Aristotle is right that the deliberation is best if participants are numerous (and assuming for simplicity that the voters are the deliberators) then this is a reason for giving all or many citizens a vote, but this does not yet show that the wiser subset should not have, say, two or three; in that way something would be given both to the value of the diverse perspectives, and to the value of the greater wisdom of the few. This combination of the Platonic and Aristotelian points is part of what I think is so formidable about Mill's proposal of plural voting. It is also an advantage of his view that he proposes to privilege not the wise, but the educated. Even if we agreed that the wise should rule, there is a serious problem about how to identify them. This becomes especially important if a successful political justification must be generally acceptable to the ruled. In that case, privileging the wise would require not only their being so wise as to be better rulers, but also, and more demandingly, that their wisdom be something that can be agreed to by all reasonable citizens. I turn to this conception of justification below.

Mill's position has great plausibility: good education promotes the ability of citizens to rule more wisely. So, how can we deny that the educated subset would rule more wisely than others. But then why shouldn't they have more votes?&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Estlund goes on to criticize Mill's education-based meritocracy on various grounds.

===19th century===
In the United States, the federal bureaucracy used the [[Spoils System]] from 1828 until the assassination of United States President [[James A. Garfield]] by a disappointed office seeker in 1881 proved its dangers. Two years later in 1883, the system of appointments to the United States Federal Bureaucracy was revamped by the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]], partially based on the British meritocratic civil service that had been established years earlier. The act stipulated that government jobs should be awarded on the basis of merit, through competitive exams, rather than ties to politicians or political affiliation. It also made it illegal to fire or demote government employees for political reasons.&lt;ref name=penl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=2&amp;psid=3115 |title=Civil Service Reform |work=Digital History |publisher=[[University of Houston]] |accessdate=2016-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To enforce the merit system and the judicial system, the law also created the [[United States Civil Service Commission]].&lt;ref name="penl" /&gt; In the modern American meritocracy, the president may hand out only a certain number of jobs, which must be approved by the [[United States Senate]].

Australia began establishing public universities in the 1850s with the goal of promoting meritocracy by providing advanced training and credentials. The educational system was set up to service urban males of middle-class background, but of diverse social and religious origins. It was increasingly extended to all graduates of the public school system, those of rural and regional background, and then to women and finally to ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Horne, and Geoffrey Sherington, "Extending the educational franchise: the social contract of Australia's public universities, 1850-1890,"  ''Paedagogica Historica'' (2010) 46#1 pp 207-227&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the middle classes and the working classes have promoted the ideal of meritocracy within a strong commitment to "mate-ship" and political equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Miriam Henry|title=Understanding Schooling: An Introductory Sociology of Australian Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-_FSMpdmK3oC&amp;pg=PA81|year=1988|publisher=Psychology Press|page=81|isbn=9780203135990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century to today===
[[Singapore]] describes meritocracy as one of its official guiding principles for domestic public policy formulation, placing emphasis on academic credentials as objective measures of merit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://app.mfa.gov.sg/data/paris/statements/REMARKS_FOR_MEDEF_28_Aug_08.html Speech by Singapore Ambassador to France], 28 August 2008. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302193448/http://app.mfa.gov.sg/data/paris/statements/REMARKS_FOR_MEDEF_28_Aug_08.html|date=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is criticism that, under this system, Singaporean society is being increasingly stratified and that an elite class is being created from a narrow segment of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.littlespeck.com/content/politics/CTrendsPolitics-061028.htm|title=Singapore's elites|author=Ngiam Tong Dow|date=28 October 2006|publisher=Little Speck|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101220026/http://www.littlespeck.com/content/politics/CTrendsPolitics-061028.htm|archive-date=1 November 2006|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore has a growing level of tutoring for children,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wyomingfreelibrary.org/growing-trend-of-uplifting-education-business-in-singapore/|title=Growing trend of uplifting education business in Singapore|newspaper=Free Library and Tuition|access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and top tutors are often paid better than school teachers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/education/1-billion-spent-tuition-one-year|title=$1 billion spent on tuition in one year|newspaper=AsiaOne|access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.epigami.sg/blog/2015-private-tuition-rates-singapore/|title=2015 Private Tuition Rates in Singapore {{!}} Epigami Blog|date=2015-01-21|newspaper=Epigami Blog|access-date=2016-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defendants{{Who|date=May 2018}} recall the ancient Chinese proverb "Wealth does not pass three generations" ({{zh|c=富不过三代}}), suggesting that the [[nepotism]] or [[cronyism]] of elitists eventually will be, and often are, replaced by those lower down the hierarchy.

Singaporean academics are continuously re-examining the application of meritocracy as an ideological tool and how it's stretched to encompass the ruling party's objectives. Professor Kenneth Paul Tan at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy asserts that  "Meritocracy, in trying to 'isolate' merit by treating people with fundamentally unequal backgrounds as superficially the same, can be a practice that ignores and even conceals the real advantages and disadvantages that are unevenly distributed to different segments of an inherently unequal society, a practice that in fact perpetuates this fundamental inequality. In this way, those who are picked by meritocracy as having merit may already have enjoyed unfair advantages from the very beginning, ignored according to the principle of nondiscrimination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Kenneth Paul|date=January 2008|title=Meritocracy and Elitism in a Global City: Ideological Shifts in Singapore|journal=International Political Science Review|volume=29|issue=7–27|pages=7–27|doi=10.1177/0192512107083445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meritocracy in the Singaporean context relates to the application of pragmatism as an ideological device which combines strict adherence to market principles ''without'' any aversion to social engineering and little propensity for classical social welfarism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/04/16/how-singapore-is-fixing-its-meritocracy/|title=Opinion {{!}} How Singapore is fixing its meritocracy|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; is further illustrated by Kenneth Paul Tan in subsequent articles:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a strong ideological quality in Singapore's pragmatism, and a strongly pragmatic quality in ideological negotiations within the dynamics of hegemony. In this complex relationship, the combination of ideological and pragmatic maneuvering over the decades has resulted in the historical dominance of government by the PAP in partnership with global capital whose interests have been advanced without much reservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Kenneth Paul|date=9 Dec 2011|title=The Ideology of Pragmatism: Neo-liberal Globalisation and Political Authoritarianism in Singapore|journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia|volume=42|issue=1|pages=67–92|doi=10.1080/00472336.2012.634644}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Within the [[Ecuador]]ian Ministry of Labor, the Ecuadorian Meritocracy Institute&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130305014509/http://www.meritocracia.gob.ec/ Web page of "Instituto Nacional de Meritocracia de Ecuador"] , 12 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; was created under the technical advice of the [[Singapore]]an government.

==Modern meritocratic movements==

===The Meritocracy Party===
In 2007 an anonymous British group called The Meritocracy Party published its first manifesto, to which they have now added more than two million words on the subject (discussing [[Hegel]], [[Rousseau]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], and various other philosophers, scientists, reformers, and revolutionaries). In summary, The Meritocracy Party wants to achieve the following:

# A world in which every child gets an equal chance to succeed in life.
# The abolishment of party politics.
# Only those with a relevant education and work experience should be allowed to vote, rather than just anyone who has reached the age of 18 or 21.
# The introduction of 100% inheritance tax, so that the super-rich can no longer pass on their wealth to a select few (their privileged children). This would mean the end of the elite dynasties and hereditary monarchy.
# A radically reformed educational system, based on the [[MBTI]] personality types, and insights from radical innovators such as [[Rudolf Steiner]] and [[Maria Montessori]].
# To replace [[free market capitalism]] with [[social capitalism]] and to replace democracy with a fully transparent meritocratic republic, under a meritocratic constitution.
# The end of [[nepotism]], [[cronyism]], discrimination, privilege and unequal chances.

On their website The Meritocracy Party lists five meritocratic principles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ug4xDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT143&amp;lpg=PT143&amp;dq=meritocracy+party+uk+principles+and+goals#v=onepage&amp;q=meritocracy%20party%20uk%20principles%20and%20goals&amp;f=false|title=The Citizen Army|last=Spartacus|first=Brother|date=2016-04-30|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc|isbn=9781326642167|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thirteen primary aims.

==Criticism==
{{see also|Just-world hypothesis}}
The term "meritocracy" was originally intended as a negative concept.{{refn|name=Fox}} One of the primary concerns with meritocracy is the unclear definition of "merit".&lt;ref&gt;Arrow, Bowles and Durlauf. ''Meritocracy and Economic Inequality''. Princeton, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; What is considered as meritorious can differ with opinions as on which qualities are considered the most worthy, raising the question of which "merit" is the highest—or, in other words, which standard is the "best" standard. As the supposed effectiveness of a meritocracy is based on the supposed competence of its officials, this standard of merit cannot be arbitrary and has to also reflect the competencies required for their roles.

The reliability of the authority and system that assesses each individual's merit is another point of concern. As a meritocratic system relies on a standard of merit to measure and compare people against, the system by which this is done has to be reliable to ensure that their assessed merit accurately reflects their potential capabilities. [[Standardized testing]], which reflects the meritocratic sorting process, has come under criticism for being rigid and unable to accurately assess many valuable qualities and potentials of students. Education theorist [[Bill Ayers]], commenting on the limitations of standardized testing, writes that "Standardized tests can't measure initiative, creativity, imagination, conceptual thinking, curiosity, effort, irony, judgment, commitment, nuance, good will, ethical reflection, or a host of other valuable dispositions and attributes. What they can measure and count are isolated skills, specific facts and function, content knowledge, the least interesting and least significant aspects of learning."&lt;ref&gt;To teach: the journey of a teacher, by William Ayers, Teachers College Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0-8077-3985-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8077-3985-3}}, pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Merit determined through the opinionated evaluations of teachers, while being able to assess the valuable qualities that cannot be assessed by standardized testing, are unreliable as the opinions, insights, biases, and standards of the teachers vary greatly. If the system of evaluation is corrupt, non-transparent, opinionated or misguided, decisions regarding who has the highest merit can be highly fallible.

The level of education required in order to become competitive in a meritocracy may also be costly, effectively limiting candidacy for a position of power to those with the means necessary to become educated. An example of this was Chinese student self-declared messiah, [[Hong Xiuquan]], who despite ranking first in a preliminary, nationwide [[imperial examination]], was unable to afford further education. As such, although he did try to study in private, Hong was ultimately noncompetitive in later examinations and unable to become a bureaucrat. This economic aspect of meritocracies has been said to continue nowadays in countries without free educations, with the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], for example, consisting only of justices who attended [[Harvard]] or [[Yale]] and generally only considering clerkship candidates who attended a [[Ivy League|top-five university]], while in the 1950s the two universities only accounted for around one fifth of the justices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Death by Degrees|url=https://nplusonemag.com/issue-14/the-intellectual-situation/death-by-degrees/|website=[[n+1]]|publisher=n+1 Foundation, Inc.|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if free education were provided, the resources that the parents of a student are able to provide outside of the curriculum, such as tutoring, exam preparation, and financial support for living costs during higher education will influence the education the student attains and the student's social position in a meritocratic society. This limits the fairness and justness of any meritocratic system. Similarly, feminist critics have noted that many hierarchical organisations actually favour individuals who have received disproportionate support of an informal kind (e.g. mentorship, word-of-mouth opportunities, and so on), such that only those who benefit from such supports are likely to understand these organisations as meritocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Critical Approaches to Continental Philosophy: Intellectual Community, Disciplinary Identity, and the Politics of Inclusion | first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Hannah | last2= Stark | first3= Briohny | last3= Walker | journal=Parrhesia: A Journal of Critical Philosophy | volume= 30 | pages= 4 | year= 2019 | url= https://www.academia.edu/38122177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern regards the principle of incompetence, or the "[[Peter Principle]]". As people rise in a meritocratic society through the social hierarchy through their demonstrated merit, they eventually reach, and become stuck, at a level too difficult for them to perform effectively; they are promoted to incompetence. This reduces the effectiveness of a meritocratic system, the supposed main practical benefit of which is the competence of those who run the society.

In his book ''Meritocratic Education and Social Worthlessness'' (Palgrave, 2012), the philosopher [[Khen Lampert]] argued that educational meritocracy is nothing but a [[post-modern]] version of [[Social Darwinism]]. Its proponents argue that the theory justifies [[social inequality]] as being meritocratic. This [[social theory]] holds that Darwin's theory of evolution by [[natural selection]] is a model, not only for the development of biological traits in a population, but also as an application for human [[social institution]]s—the existing social institutions being implicitly declared as [[normative]]. Social Darwinism shares its roots with early [[progressivism]], and was most popular from the late nineteenth century to the end of [[World War II]]. Darwin only ventured to propound his theories in a biological sense, and it is other thinkers and theorists who have applied Darwin's model normatively to unequal endowments of human ambitions.

{{efn|name=fna|This is the history of the meritocracy in the technical sense. The vaguer definition of a meritocracy as a "rule by intelligence" has been applied to many ancient Greek, Indian, Chinese, and Jewish thinkers and statesmen. For example, the Sanhedrin, the legislature of [[Ancient Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah]], is sometimes called as an "intellectual meritocracy", in the sense that its members were drawn from religious scribes and not the aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elazar|first=Daniel Judah|title=The Jewish polity: Jewish political organization from Biblical times to the present|year=1985|publisher=Indiana University Press|page=127|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GntDdBeIOqwC&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=sanhedrin%20meritocracy&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q=sanhedrin%20meritocracy&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0253331564}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appointment was self-perpetuating, however, and new members were chosen personally by existing members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Novak|first=David|title=The Jewish social contract: an essay in political theology|year=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=134|quote=The Sanhedrin were appointed by those who were members when there was a vacancy}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are not meritocracies in the administrative sense, in which merit is determined objectively as a "tested competency or ability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levinson|first=David|last2=Cookson|first2=Peter W.|last3=Sadovnik|first3=lan R. |title=Education and sociology: an encyclopedia|year=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=436}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
