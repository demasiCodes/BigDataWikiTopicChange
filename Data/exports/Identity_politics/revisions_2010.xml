Not all members of any given group are necessarily involved in identity politics.

To participate in identity politics, a group may, or may not be marginalized class of people. However, group advocates will often have a self-belief, a [[self schema]] or explanatory [[narrative]], that they are in fact a marginalized group. Typically, these group identities are defined in terms of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], [[gender]], [[sexual orientation]], [[socioeconomic]] [[Class (society)|class]], or [[neurodiversity|neurological wiring]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.

[[Minority influence]] is a central component of identity politics. Minority influence is a form of [[social influence]], which takes place when a majority is being influenced to accept the [[beliefs]] or [[behavior]] of a minority. Unlike other forms of influence this usually involves a personal shift in private [[opinion]]. This personal shift in opinion is called conversion. This type of influence is most likely to take place if the minority is consistent, flexible and appealing to the majority.

== Use of the term ==
The term ''identity politics'' has been used in political and academic discourse in the [[United States]] since the [[1970s]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}. One aim of identity politics has been to empower the oppressed to articulate their oppression in terms of their own experience—a process of [[consciousness-raising]] that distinguishes identity politics from the liberal conception of politics as driven by individual self-interest.

Identity politics is a phenomenon that arose first at the radical margins of [[liberal democratic]] societies in which human rights are recognized, and the term is not usually used to refer to dissident movements within single-party or authoritarian states.

Identity politics were first described briefly in an article by L. A. Kauffman, who traced its origins to the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC), an organization of the civil-rights movement in the early and mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Kauffman, "The Anti-Politics of Identity," ''Socialist Review'' (Oakland, Calif.) 20, no. 1 (January-March 1990), 67–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Although SNCC invented many of the fundamental practices, and various black power groups extended them, they apparently found no need to apply a term. Rather, the term emerged when others outside the black freedom movements—particularly, the race- and ethnic-specific women's liberation movements, such as [[Black feminism]]— began to adopt the practice in the late 1960s.

Perhaps the oldest written example of it can be found in the [[Combahee River Collective Statement]] of April 1977, subsequently reprinted in a number of anthologies,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Capitalist Patriarchy and the Case for Socialist Feminism'', ed. Zillah R. Eisenstein (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Barbara Smith]] and the [[Combahee River Collective]] have been credited with coining the term; which they defined as "a politics that grew out of our objective material experiences as Black women.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Duchess. ''From the Kennedy Commission to the Combahee Collective: Black Feminist Organizing, 1960-1980'', in ''Sisters in the Struggle: African American Women in the Civil Rights-Black Power Movement'', eds: Bettye Collier-Thomas, V. P. Franklin, [[NYU Press]], 2001, ISBN 0814716032, p300&lt;/ref&gt;

Some groups have combined identity politics and [[Marxist]] [[social class]] analysis and [[class consciousness]]—the most notable example being the [[Black Panther Party]]—but this is not necessarily characteristic of the form. Another example is [[MOVE]], who mixed [[black nationalism]] with [[anarcho-primitivism]] (a radical form of [[green politics]] based on the idea that civilization is an instrument of oppression, advocating a return to [[hunter gatherer]] society) and the related idea [[neo-luddism]].

==Debates and criticism==
===Nature of the movement===
The term ''identity politics'' has been applied retroactively to varying movements that long predate its coinage. Historian [[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]] discussed identity politics extensively in his book ''The Disuniting of America.''  Schlesinger, a strong supporter of liberal conceptions of [[civil rights]], argues that a [[liberal democracy]] requires a common basis for [[culture]] and [[society]] to function.

In his view, basing politics on group marginalization fractures the civil polity, and therefore works against creating real opportunities for ending marginalization.  Schlesinger believes that movements for civil rights should aim toward full acceptance and integration of marginalized groups into the mainstream culture, rather than, in his view, perpetuating that marginalization through affirmations of difference.

===LGBT issues===
{{See also|Queer nationalism|Political lesbianism}}
Some [[LGBT rights]] [[activist]]s, in particular, criticize the identity politics approach to [[gay rights]], particularly the approach based around the terms and concepts of [[queer theory]]. Other theorists, drawing on the work of [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]], describe some forms of identity politics as [[strategic essentialism]] that works with [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] discourses to achieve collective goals.

Liberal-reformist gay and lesbian activists work for full acceptance of gays and lesbians in the institutions and culture of mainstream society, but [[queer]] activists instead make a point of declaring themselves outside of the mainstream and having no desire to be accepted by or join it.  The former criticize the latter's approach as counterproductive and as perpetuating discrimination and societal attitudes against LGBT people, while the latter counter that the former seek to subsume LGBT identities in order to capitalize upon other forms of (racial, economic, geographical) privilege.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indegayforum.org/news/show/27067.html Ndegayforum.org 27067]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indegayforum.org/news/show/27052.html Nndegayforum.org 27052]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homogeneity and essentialism===
Others counter that the intolerant homogeneity of mainstream culture is precisely the fact that makes full acceptance impossible, and that social justice movements should aim not toward integration but rather multicultural pluralism, without recourse to the types of oppressive homogeneity now at play. (See the work of [[Urvashi Vaid]] for a discussion of the perils of homogeneity.)

Other critics of identity politics claim that it tends toward [[essentialism]], arguing that some of its proponents assume or imply that gender, race, or other group characteristics are fixed or biologically determined traits (or, in the case of gay liberation, based on the [[Freudian]] idea that we're all driven by our sexuality), rather than social constructions. Such criticism is most common with regard to groups based on claims of gender or sexual orientation, where the nature of the defining trait is in dispute.

===Shared identity===
Still other critics have argued that groups based on shared identity, other than class (e.g.: religious identity or neurological wiring), can divert energy and attention from more fundamental issues, such as class conflict in [[capitalism|capitalist]] societies. Even those who support [[gay rights]], ending [[racism]] or [[freedom of religion]], for instance, may consider these side issues at best.

Such arguments have been expressed by a number of writers, such as [[Eric Hobsbawm]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amielandmelburn.org.uk/articles/1996%20annual%20lecture.htm Amielandmelburn.org.uk articles]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Todd Gitlin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript235.html PBS.org], Thinktank transcript 235&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Tomasky]], [[Richard Rorty]], [[Sean Wilentz]], [[Robert W. McChesney]], Bart Landry, and [[Jim Sleeper]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=115&amp;subsecID=172&amp;contentID=2049 Ppionline.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Hobsbawm, in particular, has criticized nationalisms, and the principle of national self-determination adopted internationally after [[World War I]], since national governments are often merely an expression of a ruling class or power, and their proliferation was a source of the wars of the twentieth century. Hence Hobsbawm argues that identity politics, such as [[queer nationalism]], [[Islamism]], [[Cornish nationalism]] or [[Ulster Loyalism]] are just other versions of [[bourgeois nationalism]].

==Identity politics in art and culture==

Many artistic and cultural movements have articulated identity politics, especially in the Hip-hop, [[skinhead]] and [[punk subculture]]s. The means that identity politics have been expressed are in music ([[hip-hop music]], [[punk rock]], [[reggae]], [[soul music]]), [[film]] and [[fanzine]]s. Punk rock genres that have been centred on identity politics are [[Anarcho-punk]], [[queercore]] and [[riot grrrl]]. Aside from [[gender]] and [[sexual orientation]], class identity has been expressed in [[Oi!]], originating in the [[working class]] [[East End of London]].

Skinhead identity has traditionally been based on class, with many [[skinhead reggae]], [[Oi!]], Hardcore and [[Two-tone]] songs expressing working class pride and racial unity. When soul and reggae lyrics became expressions of [[black nationalism]] and/or [[Rastafari]] (with a variation of [[Zionism]]), many white skinheads were alienated at the shift in themes. However, [[Nazi Skinhead]]s are focused on [[white pride]] and their music and [[zines]] reflect this. For example, [[Rock Against Communism]] often has lyrics about white pride and [[white separatism]], but no reference to [[Communism]] (Nazi Skinheads are anti-Communist and anti-left).     

[[Hip Hop music]] has expressed identity politics in the form of [[Black Nationalism|Black]] and [[Chicano nationalism]], but [[Homo hop]] has expressed Queer identity politics, much like [[queercore]] has in the punk and indie scene. [[Hip-Hop activism]] draws on black liberation movements but also encompasses issues like [[environmentalism]].

[[Lowriding]] was made into an artistic expression of identity politics by the [[Royal Chicano Air Force]], an organisation established to support equality for [[Mexican American]]s. Some [[lowrider]]s often have [[murals]] celebrating Chicano culture and history.
