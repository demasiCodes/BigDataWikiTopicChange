In Western politics, the term ''conservatism'' often refers to the school of thought based on British politician [[Edmund Burke]]'s criticism of the [[French Revolution]].  Though his legacy as a conservative is disputed, he wrote against the excesses of mob rule.&lt;ref&gt;''Absolutism and Constitutionalism in Western Europe'', "Edmund Burke was a conservative political theorist who criticized the French Revolution." http://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:KNDmw5FzoS0J:staff.esuhsd.org/dayd/ap_euro/16_absolutism_west/Chapter%252016%2520-%2520Multiple-Choice%2520Questions.pdf+%22Edmund+Burke+was+a+conservative%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;sig=AFQjCNFRSYhlWWUUEzn345OTffwu8mAQZQ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan, "Conservatism", ''Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'', Third Edition, "Burke's ''Reflections on the Revolution in France'' has been taken as definitive and formative of modern conservatism... .

R. J. White wrote: "To put conservatism in a bottle with a label is like trying to liquify the atmosphere ... The difficulty arises from the nature of the thing. For conservatism is less a political doctrine than a habit of mind, a mode of feeling, a way of living."&lt;ref&gt;As part of introduction to ''The Conservative Tradition'', ed. R.J. White (London: Nicholas Kaye, 1950)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russell Kirk]] considered conservatism "the negation of ideology."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kirkcenter.org/kirk/ten-principles.html "10 Conservative Principles"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conservative political parties]] have diverse views; the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] in Japan, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in the [[United States]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in Britain, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] in India, the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] in Canada and the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] are all considered major conservative parties with varying positions.

==Development of Western conservatism==
{{Refimprove|section|date=November 2008}}
[[Image:Edmund Burke by Sir Joshua Reynolds.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Edmund Burke]] (1729–1797)]]
Historians use the word "conservative" to describe governments and leaders from the earliest recorded times, but it was not until the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and the reaction to events surrounding the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, that modern conservatism rose as a distinct political attitude or train of thought. Many point to the rise of a conservative disposition in the wake of the [[Protestant Reformation]], specifically to the works of influential [[Anglican]] theologian, [[Richard Hooker (theologian)|Richard Hooker]], emphasizing moderation in the political balancing of interests towards the goals of social harmony and common good. [[Edmund Burke]]’s polemic ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790) helped conservatism gain prominence. [[Edmund Burke]] opposed the [[French Revolution]], which he saw as violent and chaotic. He pressed for parliamentary control of royal patronage and expenditure.&lt;ref name="BBC: Edmund Burke 1729 - 1797"/&gt;

[[File:Jmaistre.jpg|left|thumb|160px|[[Joseph de Maistre]] (1753-1821)]]  He argued that some people have less reason than others, and thus some people will make better governments than others if they rely upon reason.  The proper formulation of government came not from abstractions such as reason, but from time-honoured development of the state, piecemeal progress through experience, and the continuation of other important societal institutions such as the family and the church.  Tradition draws on the wisdom of many generations and the tests of time, while reason may be a mask for the preferences of one man, and at best represents only the untested wisdom of one generation.   However, Burke also wrote, "A state without the means of change is without the means of its conservation," but insisted that further change be organic rather than revolutionary. An attempt to modify the complex web of human interactions that form human society, for the sake of some doctrine or theory, runs the risk of running afoul of the iron law of [[unintended consequence]]s.

Western conservatism has also been influenced by the [[Counter-Enlightenment]] works of [[Joseph de Maistre]]. Maistre argued for the restoration of hereditary [[monarchy]], which he considered to be a [[divine right of Kings|divinely sanctioned institution]], and for the indirect authority of the [[Pope]] over temporal matters. He also defended the principle of [[hierarchical]] [[authority]], which the Revolution sought to destroy. Maistre published in 1819 his masterpiece ''Du Pape'' ("On the Pope"). The work is divided into four parts. In the first he argues that, in the [[Roman Catholicism|church]], the [[pope]] is [[sovereignty|sovereign]], and that it is an essential characteristic of all sovereign power that its decisions should be subject to no appeal. Consequently, the pope is [[Papal infallibility|infallible]] in his teaching, since it is by his teaching that he exercises his sovereignty. In the remaining divisions the author examines the relations of the pope and the temporal powers, civilization and the welfare of nations, and the [[schism (religion)|schismatic]] churches. He argues that nations require protection against abuses of power by a sovereignty superior to all others, and that this sovereignty should be that of the papacy, the historical saviour and maker of European civilization.

Conservatives strongly support the right of property, and Carl B. Cone, in ''Burke and the Nature of Politics'', pointed out that this view, expressed as philosophy, also served the interests of the people involved.&lt;ref&gt; Carl B. Cone, ''Burke and the Nature of Politics'', University of Kentucky Press, 1957 {{OCLC|399586}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservatives diverge from [[classical liberalism]] in the tradition of [[Adam Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=1689 American Chronicle | Liberal / Conservative (Part 1) Economics&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some conservatives  look to a modified free market order, such as the [[American System (economic plan)|American System]], [[ordoliberalism]], or [[Friedrich List|Friedrich List's]] [[National System]]. The latter view differs from strict [[laissez-faire]], in that the state's role is to promote competition while maintaining the national interest, community and identity.

Most conservatives strongly support the [[sovereign nation]], and [[Patriotism|patriotically]] identify with their own nation. Nationalist [[Separatism|separatist]] movements may simultaneously be both radical and conservative.

==Forms of conservatism==
===Liberal conservatism===
[[Liberal conservatism]] is a variant of conservatism that combines conservative values and policies with [[Liberalism|liberal]] stances. As these latter two terms have had different meanings over time and across countries, liberal conservatism also has a wide variety of meanings. Historically, the term often referred to the combination of [[Liberal theory of economics|economic liberalism]], which champions [[laissez-faire]] markets, with the classical conservatism concern for established [[tradition]], respect for authority and religious values. It contrasted itself with [[classical liberalism]], which supported [[Individual freedom|freedom for the individual]] in both the economic and social spheres.

Over time, the general conservative philosophy has nothing in itself to do with economic liberal arguments. Conservatism has nothing to do with liberal economic thinking per se. This is also the case in countries where liberal economic ideas have been the tradition, such as the United States, and are thus considered conservative. In other countries where liberal conservative movements have entered the political mainstream, such as [[Italy]] and  [[Spain]], the terms ''liberal'' and ''conservative'' may be synonymous. The liberal conservative tradition in the United States combines the economic [[individualism]] of the classical liberals with a [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] form of conservatism (which has also become part of the [[American conservatism|American conservative]] tradition, such as in the writings of [[Russell Kirk]]).

A secondary meaning for the term ''liberal conservatism'' that has developed in [[Europe]] is a combination of more modern conservative (less [[traditional]]ist) views with those of [[social liberalism]]. This has developed as an opposition to the more [[collectivist]] views of [[socialism]]. Often this involves stressing what are now conservative views of free-market economics and belief in [[individual]] [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]], with social liberal views on defense of [[civil rights]], [[environmentalism]] and support for a limited [[welfare state]]. This philosophy is that of [[Sweden|Swedish]] Prime Minister [[Fredrik Reinfeldt]]. In continental Europe, this is sometimes also translated into [[English language|English]] as [[social conservatism]].
''

===Conservative liberalism===
[[Conservative liberalism]] is a variant of [[liberalism]] that combines liberal values and policies with conservative stances, or, more simply, the right wing of the liberal movement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wikipolitique.fr/Libéralisme_conservateur&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parties-and-elections.de/contents.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mair"&gt;[[Michael Gallagher (academic)|M. Gallagher]], M. Laver and [[Peter Mair|P. Mair]], ''Representative Government in Europe'', p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of conservative liberalism are found at the beginning of the [[History of liberal thought|history of liberalism]]. Until the two [[World Wars]], in most European countries the political class was formed by conservative liberals, from [[Germany]] to [[Italy]]. Conservative liberalism is a more [[Positive liberty|positive]] and less [[Political radicalism|radical]] version of [[classical liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen R.T., ''Beyond Liberalism'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The events such as [[World War I]] occurring after 1917 brought the more radical version of classical liberalism to a more conservative (i.e. more moderate) type of liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Allen R.T., ''Beyond Liberalism'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libertarian conservatism===
{{Main|Libertarian conservatism}}
[[Libertarian conservatism]] describes certain political ideologies within the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] which combines [[libertarian]] economic issues with aspects of conservatism. Its five main branches are [[Constitutionalism]], [[paleolibertarianism]], neolibertarianism, [[American conservatism|small government conservatism]] and [[Christian libertarianism]]. Additionally, they may overlap with [[paleoconservatives]] in their support for federalism, opposition to the welfare state and opposition to imperialism though the latter group tends to be more nationalistic, sometimes even embracing protectionism (see: [[Economic Nationalism]]).&lt;ref name="paleo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paleoconservatives - Definition on Worddiq|url=http://www.wordiq.com/definition/Paleoconservatives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars such as [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]] labeled libertarian conservatism [[right-libertarianism]].&lt;ref name="nlm"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Libertarian Manifesto|url=http://agorism.info/NewLibertarianManifesto.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="int"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview With Samuel Edward Konkin III|url=http://www.spaz.org/~dan/individualist-anarchist/software/konkin-interview.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libertarian Conservatives support strict [[laissez-faire]] policies such as [[free trade]], opposition to the [[Federal Reserve]] and opposition to [[regulations|business regulations]]. They are opposed to[[corporate welfare]], [[subsidies]], and other areas of economic intervention. Many of them have views in accord to [[Ludwig von Mises]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} However, many of them oppose [[abortion]], as they see it as a [[positive liberty]] and violates the [[non-aggression principle]] because abortion is aggression towards the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/vance/vance133.html|title=Is Ron Paul Wrong on Abortion?|last=Vance|first=Laurence |date=January 29, 2008|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=2008-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiscal conservatism===

[[Fiscal conservatism]] is the economic philosophy of prudence in government spending and debt. Edmund Burke, in his '[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]', articulated its principles:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...[I]t is to the property of the citizen, and not to the demands of the creditor of the state, that the first and original faith of civil society is pledged. The claim of the citizen is prior in time, paramount in title, superior in equity. The fortunes of individuals, whether possessed by acquisition or by descent or in virtue of a participation in the goods of some community, were no part of the creditor's security, expressed or implied...[T]he public, whether represented by a monarch or by a senate, can pledge nothing but the public estate; and it can have no public estate except in what it derives from a just and proportioned imposition upon the citizens at large.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Social conservatism===
[[Social conservatism]] stresses the conservative attention for social stability and order. In order to maintain that order and social peace, also the lower classes have to be integrated into society (cf [[Benjamin Disraeli]] 's risk of Two nations, as described in [[Sybil (novel)|Sybil]]).

In Europe, social conservatism has played an important role in history, being the direct parent of [[christian democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Heywood, ''Political ideologies. An introduction'', New York, Macmillan, 2003, 89&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/facts/5/1037709/Leo-XIII-as-discussed-in-conservatism-political-philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian democracy provided the ideological basis for the conservative, [[corporatist]] or [[christian democrat]] version ([[neo-corporatism]]) of the [[welfare state]].([[Esping-Andersen]])

Nowadays, the christian democratic family ([[European People's Party]]) is the largest in the [[European parliament]]. The double heritage of the EPP ([[conservatism]] and its political heir [[christian democracy]]) explains the EPP's current composition.

The evolution of conservatism into social conservatism in Europe also explains parts of the differences in [[political culture]] between the United States and Europe.

===Green conservatism===
[[Green conservatism]] is a term used to refer to conservatives who have incorporated [[Green politics|green]] concerns into their [[ideology]]. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the United Kingdom under [[David Cameron]] has embraced a green agenda that includes proposals designed to impose a tax on workplace car parking spaces, a halt to airport growth, a tax on 4x4 vehicles and restrictions on car advertising.  {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

===Cultural conservatism===
{{Main|Cultural conservatism}}
Cultural conservatism is a philosophy that supports preservation of the heritage of a nation or culture. The culture in question may be as large as [[Western culture]] or [[Eastern world|Eastern culture]] or as small as that of [[Tibet]]. Cultural conservatives try to adapt norms handed down from the past. The norms may be romantic, like the [[anti-metric movement]] that demands the retention of [[avoirdupois]] weights and measures in Britain and opposes their replacement with the [[Metrication#United Kingdom|metric system]]. They may be institutional: in the West this has included [[chivalry]] and [[feudalism]], as well as [[capitalism]], [[laicité]] and the [[rule of law]].

In the subset [[social conservatism]], the norms may also be what is viewed as a question of morality. In some cultures,  practices such as [[homosexuality]] are seen as immoral. In others, it is considered immoral for a woman to reveal too much of her body.

Cultural conservatives often argue that old institutions have adapted to a particular place or culture and therefore ought to be preserved. Others argue that a people have a right to their cultural norms, their own language and traditions.

===Religious conservatism===
Religious conservatives seek to apply the teachings of particular ideologies to politics, sometimes by proclaiming the value of those teachings, at other times seeking to have those teachings influence laws. Religious conservatism may support, or be supported by, secular customs. In other places or at other times, religious conservatism may find itself at odds with the culture in which the believers reside. In some cultures, there is conflict between two or more different groups of religious conservatives, each claiming both that their view is correct, and that opposing views are wrong.

Because many religions preserve a founding text, or at least a set of well-established traditions, the possibility of radical religious conservatism arises. These are radical both in the sense of abolishing the status quo and of a perceived return to the radix or root of a belief. They are ante conservative in their claim to be preserving the belief in its original or pristine form. Radical religious conservatism generally sees the status quo as corrupted by abuses, corruption, or heresy. One example of such a movement was the [[radical reformation]] within the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the later [[restorationists]] of the 1800s. Similar phenomena have arisen in practically all the world's religions, in many cases triggered by the violent cultural collision between the traditional society in question and the modern Western society that has developed throughout the world over the past 500 years.

===Australia===
[[Image:Turnbull.JPG|thumb|110px|[[Malcolm Turnbull]], the leader of [[Liberal Party of Australia]].]]
Conservatism in [[Australia]] is related to British and American conservatism in many respects, but has a distinct political tradition. One scholar argues that Australian conservatism is traditionally composed of diverse groups and interests that are united more by opposition to certain political developments than by a distinct shared ideology.&lt;ref name="gw"/&gt; In terms of partisan politics, conservatism has often been defined as opposition to the [[Australian Labor Party]]. Australian groups that have historically been grouped on the conservative side include social conservatives, [[British Empire]] nationalists, organizations supporting rural interests, anti-socialist [[Catholics]], fundamentalist Christians and [[free-market]] [[Liberalism|liberals]]."&lt;ref name="gw"/&gt;

Historically, for the first 70 years after the [[Federation of Australia]], the non-Labor (and hence implicitly conservative) side of Australian politics was associated with policies of moderate [[protectionism]] in trade, and of support for the [[welfare state]], coupled with maintenance of Australia's ties to the British Empire. Many scholars have seen the government of [[Robert Menzies]] as exemplifying this trend.&lt;ref name="gw"/&gt; However, from the 1980s, [[free-market]] economic policies were increasingly associated with conservatism in Australian politics, following the same trend as the United States under [[Ronald Reagan]] and the United Kingdom  under [[Margaret Thatcher]].&lt;ref name="gw"/&gt; In contemporary Australian politics, the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] is seen as the  main conservative party.

===Botswana===

[[Seretse Khama]] founded the conservative [[Botswana Democratic Party]] and it has been the most popular party in Botswana. According to the [[Economic Freedom of the World]] survey, Botswana is Africa's second most capitalist country.

===Canada===
{{Main|Canadian conservatism}}
Presently represented by Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] and his ruling [[Conservative Party of Canada]], Canadian conservatism has always been rooted in a preference for the traditional and established ways of doing things, even as it has shifted in economic, foreign and social policy. Like Burke, they rejected the sense of both [[ideology]] and [[revolution]], preferring [[pragmatism]] and [[evolution]]. It is for that reason that unlike [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives in the United States]], Canadian conservatives are generally not [[Republicanism in Canada|republicans]], preferring the [[Monarchism in Canada|monarchy]] and [[Westminster system]] of government. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===People's Republic of China===
{{Main|New Conservatism (People's Republic of China)}}
In the [[People's Republic of China]], new conservatism (新保守主义), sometimes translated as "neoconservatism", was a movement which first arose in the early 1990s and argued that [[progress]] was best accomplished through gradual reform of [[society]], eschewing [[revolution]] and sudden overthrow of the [[governmental]] system. This movement was based heavily on the ideas of [[Edmund Burke]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} and was described in the West by the scholar Joseph Fewsmith. Other than the name, the movement had no connection with neoconservatism in the [[United States]] (the US movement is instead referred to as Niukang in Chinese), though, from the standpoint of philosophy, it can be identified as a form of [[conservative]] thought, albeit ideologically different from "old conservatism" (旧保守主义).

===Taiwan (Republic of China)===
[[Image:2006INGTaipeiMarathon-077.jpg|left|140px|thumb|[[Republic of China|Taiwan]]'s President [[Ma Ying-jeou]], who pledged to expand [[free trade]].]]
In the [[Republic of China]],commonly known as [[Taiwan]], the conservative [[Kuomintang|Kuomintang (KMT)]], generally supports [[free trade]] with China.  The KMT also has been known to be [[anti-communist]] and follows the [[Three Principles of the People]].

===Germany===
[[Image:Angela Merkel (2008).jpg|thumb|130px|[[Angela Merkel]], the first female chancellor of Germany.]]
In Germany, conservatism has often been represented by [[Christian Democracy|Christian Democratic]] parties. They form the bulk of the [[European People's Party]] faction in the [[European Parliament]]. The origin of these parties is usually in Catholic parties of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and [[Catholic social teaching]] was their original inspiration. Over the years, conservatism gradually became their main ideological inspiration, and they generally became less Catholic. The German [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU), its Bavarian sister party [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU), and the Dutch [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA) are Protestant-Catholic parties.

===India===
Conservatism in India is represented by [[Hindu nationalist]] parties like the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP)&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Blom Hansen, ''The Saffron Wave: Democracy and Hindu Nationalism in Modern India'', Princeton University Press, 2001, ISBN 140080342X, 9781400803422&lt;/ref&gt;.  BJP advocates conservative social policies, self reliance, robust economic growth, foreign policy driven by a nationalist agenda, and strong national defense.  [[Hindutva]] has a special place in its ideology and the party believes that ancient Hindu culture and values will make India a more enlightened society. BJP falls more correctly in the [[Centre-right]] definition.

===Iran===
[[File:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leader of the Alliance of Builders of Islamic Iran]]
In [[Iran]], conservatism is represented by parties such as the [[Combatant Clergy Association]] (CCA), which includes the nation’s foremost politicized clerics (including the current [[Ayatollah]]) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.s2online.org/news/country/Iraq/IRANpol.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered to be part of the "Islamic right".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uvm.edu/~fgause/168read.htm Elections Summaries for POLS 168 -- Middle East Politics (Fall 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt; The CCA was the majority party in the fourth and fifth parliaments after the [[Islamic revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akhbar-rooz.com/article.jsp?essayId=4844 akhbare-rooz (iranian political Bulletin)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1977 by a group of clerics with intentions to use cultural approaches to overthrow [[the Shah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0304-2421(199606)25%3A3%3C349%3AICAATR%3E2.0.CO%3B2-9]&lt;/ref&gt; Some conservative Iranian political parties and organizations are part of the powerful [[Alliance of Builders of Islamic Iran]]. The alliance, mostly active in [[Tehran]], won almost all of Tehran's seats in the [[Iranian Majlis election, 2004|Iranian Majlis election of 2004]] and the [[Iranian City and Village Councils election, 2003|Iranian City and Village Councils election of 2003]]. [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], former mayor of Tehran (who is chosen by Tehran's City Council) and now [[President of Iran]], is considered one of the main figures in the alliance.

===Israel===
In [[Israel]], [[Likud]] is the major [[centre-right]] political party. Founded in 1973 as an alliance of several right-wing and liberal parties, Likud's victory in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|1977 elections]] was a major turning point in the country's political history.&lt;ref&gt;Israel at the Polls, 1992 By Daniel Judah Elazar, Shmuel Sandler&lt;/ref&gt; Likud supports [[free market]] [[capitalism]] and [[liberalism]]. Likud, under the guidance of [[Finance minister]] [[Binyamin Netanyahu]], pushed through legislation to reduce [[value added tax]] (VAT), income and corporate taxes, as well as [[customs duty]]. The party has instituted free trade (especially with the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]]) and has dismantled certain monopolies (e.g. [[Bezeq]] and the sea ports). It has privatized numerous government-owned companies (e.g. [[El Al]] and [[Bank Leumi]]).

Likud has in the past espoused [[hawkish]] policies towards the [[Palestinians]], including opposition to Palestinian statehood and support of the Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. However, it has also been the party which carried out the first peace agreements with Arab states. For instance, in 1979, Likud Prime Minister, [[Menachem Begin]], signed the [[Camp David Accords]] with [[Egypt]]ian President [[Anwar al-Sadat]], which returned the [[Sinai Peninsula]] (occupied by Israel in the Six-Day War of 1967) to Egypt in return for peace between the two countries. [[Yitzhak Shamir]] also granted some legitimacy to the Palestinians by meeting them at the ill-fated [[Madrid Conference of 1991|Madrid Conference]] following the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] in 1991. However, Shamir refused to concede the idea of a Palestinian state, and as a result was blamed by some (including [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[James Baker]]) for the failure of the summit. Later, as Prime Minister, [[Binyamin Netanyahu]] restated Likud's position of opposing Palestinian statehood, which after the [[Oslo Accords]] was largely accepted by the opposition [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labor Party]], even though the shape of any such state was not clear.

The Likud emphasize such nationalist themes as the flag and the victory in [[Israel]]'s 1948 war with neighbouring [[Arab]] states. The Likud advocates teaching values in childhood education. The Likud endorses press freedom and promotion of private-sector media, which has grown markedly under governments Likud has led. A Likud government headed by Ariel Sharon, however, closed the popular right-wing [[pirate radio]] station [[Arutz 7]] ("Channel 7). Arutz 7 was popular with the settlement movement and often criticised the government from a right-wing perspective. However, the Likud is inclined towards the [[Torah]] and expresses support for it within the context of civil Judaism, as a result of its [[Irgun]] past, which aligned itself according to the word of the [[Tanakh]].

===Japan===
[[Image:Koizumi in Graceland 2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[Junichiro Koizumi]], a leader of the right-wing [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)]] who won the largest party majority ever in modern Japanese history.]]
Japan's conservative [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]]  - which has dominated elections for half a century&amp;nbsp;— traditionally identified itself with a number of general goals such as rapid, export-based economic growth and close cooperation with the [[United States]] in foreign and defense policies, as well as several newer issues, such as administrative reform. Administrative reform encompassed several themes: simplification and streamlining of government bureaucracy; privatization of [[Japanese public corporations|state owned enterprises]]; and adoption of measures, including tax reform, needed to prepare for the strain on the economy posed by an [[Aging of Japan|aging society]].

Other priorities in the early 1990s included promoting a more active and positive role for Japan in the rapidly developing Asia-Pacific region, internationalizing Japan's economy by liberalizing and promoting domestic demand, creating a high technology information society, and promoting scientific research.

===Nepal===
The Nepali politics can be viewed as a very interesting clash of left wing parties, liberal democratic parties, conservative democratic parties and the ultra-conservatism practiced by the now-abolished Monarchy. Because of the decade long Maoist insurgency and the movements of other parties, people of Nepal seem to be rejecting the idea of extreme conservatism, and consequently the [[Nepalese monarchy]] has now been abolished. However, an intense debate still exists between intellectuals and political activists regarding the degree of conservatism in Nepali politics. While the Unified [[CPN (Maoist)]] propose a progressive ideology, rejecting all the conservative ideas; The [[CPN-UML]], a democratic party with communist background, seems to be supporting progressive ideas blended with some conservatism. The right wing party of [[Nepali Congress]], is considered to be more conservative than others because of their history of supporting the idea of the now abolished Hindu State as well as the idea of ceremonial monarchy. However, Nepali Congress too has adopted a Republican set up after the [[2006 democracy movement in Nepal]].

Historians view the inter party clash in this small nation as a melting pot of all the ideologies of the political spectrum and the intense discussions continues to intrigue many political analysts.

===Netherlands===
[[Image:Ayaan-Hirsi-Ali-VVD.NL-1200x1600.JPG|left|90px|thumb|[[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], a writer and a former MEP from the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]].]]
In the strict sense, the Netherlands did not have a conservative tradition until the early 2000s. In the nineteenth-century, Dutch statesmen such as [[Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer]] and [[Abraham Kuyper]] heavily criticized modernity, but their ideas evolved toward [[Christian Democracy]] instead of conservatism.

Explicit conservatism in the Netherlands starts with [[Andreas Kinneging]] a philosopher of law who denounced liberalism in favour of the Christian and classical foundations of Western civilization. In the early 2000s, he gathered around a group of young conservatives, among them activist [[Joshua Livestro]] and journalist [[Bart Jan Spruyt]], and founded the Edmund Burke Foundation with the ambition of becoming either a major intellectual influence or a political movement. This project failed. The Foundation now focuses on introducing conservatism to students.

Traditionally, the Dutch conservative-liberal [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] combines advocacy of free market economy and lower taxes with advocacy of such personal liberties as euthanasia and the use of softdrugs. The [[Party for Freedom]] is a newly formed party with conservative sentiments, advocating strict restriction on immigration from Muslim countries and a return to what it calls the 'Judeo-Christian civilization'. However, it defends values which are usually not associated with conservatives, such as same-sex marriages. Furthermore, on social and economic issues it recently tends to vote as often with parties on the Left as well as on the Right. The party is led by [[Geert Wilders]].

===New Zealand===
[[Image:John Key National Party2.jpg|thumb|100px|[[John Key]], Current Prime Minister of New Zealand.]]

The [[New Zealand National Party]] ("National" or "the Nats") {{As of|2008|alt=currently}} forms the largest (in terms of parliamentary seats) [[political party]] in the next [[New Zealand Parliament]], and thus function as the core of a governing coalition. For many decades "National" has been the largest liberal-conservative political party in New Zealand.

The National Party {{As of|2007|alt=currently}} advocates policies of reducing [[tax]]es, reducing [[social welfare]] payments, promoting [[free trade]], restoring or maintaining New Zealand's defence alliances, and promoting one standard of citizenship for all New Zealanders ("One law for all").

===Saudi Arabia===
[[Saudi Arabia]] has been under the influence of conservative clerics who uphold a strict interpretation of [[Islamic law]], and the monarchy supports conservative social polices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0709 Oxford Islamic Studies Online Saudi Arabia]&lt;/ref&gt;  Women are required to dress modestly, and all sexual activity outside of a traditional heterosexual marriage is illegal. Dancing, playing music or showing movies in public are forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1012.html Saudi Arabia Country Specific Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scandinavian countries===
In [[Scandinavia]]n countries, conservatism has been represented in [[Liberal conservatism|liberal conservative]] parties such as the [[Kokoomus|National Coalition party]] in [[Finland]], the [[Moderate Party]] in Sweden, [[Høyre (party)|Høyre]] in Norway and the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]] in Denmark.  Domestically, these parties generally support market-oriented policies. Denmark's conservative-liberal [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] has been characterized as a classical liberal party. Their former leader ([[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]]) wrote the book ''Fra Socialstat til Minimalstat'' ({{lang-en|From Social State to Minimal State}}), which advocated an extensive reform along classical liberal lines. This said, it should be noted that the former prime minister stated that classical liberalism is "out-dated" and gravitated towards a heavily social-democratically influenced approach towards managing the state &lt;ref&gt;[http://raeson.dk/ca070205.htm "Raeson"], raeson.dk - february 7th, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.180grader.dk/klumme/Liberalismen_er_alt_andet_end_for_ldet.php "180grader.dk"], 180grader.dk - august 30th, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;.

===South Korea===
In the 2008 parliamentary elections, the conservative [[Grand National Party]] won 37% of the vote in South Korea, compared with 25% for the liberal [[United Democratic Party]]&lt;ref&gt;http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/k/korea/korea2008.txt&lt;/ref&gt;. After decades of free market policies, free trade, and low taxation, South Korea is a major [[G20 industrial nations|economic power]] and one of the wealthiest countries in Asia. It had one of the world's fastest growing economies since the 1960s, now highly [[developed country|developed]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1018.html Korea, Republic of&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[List of Asian countries by GDP|fourth largest]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper

===United Kingdom===
Conservatism in the [[United Kingdom]] is related to its counterparts in other Western nations, but has a distinct tradition. [[Edmund Burke]] is often considered the ''father of conservatism'' in the English-speaking world. Burke was a [[British Whig Party|Whig]], while the term ''[[Tory]]'' is given to the later Conservative Party. One [[Australia]]n scholar argues, "For Edmund Burke and Australians of a like mind, the essence of conservatism lies not in a body of theory, but in the disposition to maintain those institutions seen as central to the beliefs and practices of society."&lt;ref name="gw"&gt;Worthington, Glen, [http://web.archive.org/web/20060913184447/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rn/2001-02/02RN29.htm Conservatism in Australian National Politics], Parliament of Australia Parliamentary Library, 19 February 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Thatcher - Reagan c872-9.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Margaret Thatcher]], United Kingdom prime minister and [[Ronald Reagan]], American president.]]
The old established form of English, and after the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]], British conservatism, was the Tory Party. It reflected the attitudes of a rural land owning class, and championed the institutions of the monarchy, the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican Church]], the family, and property as the best defence of the social order. In the early stages of the [[industrial revolution]], it seemed to be totally opposed to a process that seemed to undermine some of these bulwarks. The new industrial elite were seen by many as enemies to the social order. [[Robert Peel]] was able to reconcile the new industrial class to the Tory landed class by persuading the latter to accept the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846. He created a new political group that sought to preserve the old status quo while accepting the basics of [[laissez-faire]] and [[free trade]]. The new coalition of traditional landowners and sympathetic industrialists constituted the new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].

[[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]] gave the new party a political ideology. As a young man, he was influenced by the [[romantic movement]] and [[medievalism]], and developed a devastating critique of industrialism. In his novels, he outlined an England divided into two nations, each living in perfect ignorance of each other. He foresaw, like [[Karl Marx]], the phenomenon of an alienated industrial proletariat. His solution involved a return to an idealised view of a corporate or organic society, in which everyone had duties and responsibilities towards other people or groups. This "one nation" conservatism is still a significant tradition in British politics. It has animated a great deal of social reform undertaken by successive Conservative governments.

Although nominally a Conservative, Disraeli was sympathetic to some of the demands of the [[Chartists]] and argued for an alliance between the landed aristocracy and the working class against the increasing power of the middle class, helping to found the [[Young England]] group in 1842 to promote the view that the rich should use their power to protect the poor from exploitation by the middle class. The conversion of the Conservative Party into a modern mass organisation was accelerated by the concept of [[Tory Democracy]] attributed to Lord [[Randolph Churchill]].

[[Image:CMEC 1 009.jpg|thumb|[[David Cameron]], the leader of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].]]
A Liberal-Conservative coalition during [[World War I]], coupled with the ascent of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], hastened the collapse of the Liberals in the 1920s. After [[World War II]], the Conservative Party made concessions to the socialist policies of the Left. This compromise was a pragmatic measure to regain power, but also the result of the early successes of [[central planning]] and state ownership forming a cross-party consensus. This was known as [[Butskellism]], after the almost identical [[Keynesian]] policies of [[Rab Butler]] on behalf of the Conservatives, and [[Hugh Gaitskell]] for Labour.

However, in the 1980s, under the leadership of [[Margaret Thatcher]], and the influence of [[Keith Joseph]], there was a dramatic shift in the ideological direction of British conservatism, with a movement towards [[free-market]] economic policies. As one commentator explains, "The [[privatization]] of state owned industries, unthinkable before, became commonplace [during Thatcher's government] and has now been imitated all over the world."&lt;ref name="mt"&gt;Davies, Stephen, [http://www.ashbrook.org/publicat/onprin/v1n2/davies.html Margaret Thatcher and the Rebirth of Conservatism], Ashbrook Center for Public Affairs, July 1993&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some commentators have questioned whether [[Thatcherism]] was consistent with the traditional concept of conservatism in the [[United Kingdom]], and saw her views as more consistent with [[classical liberalism]]. Thatcher was described as "a radical in a conservative party"&lt;ref name="mt"/&gt;, and her ideology has been seen as confronting "established institutions" and the "accepted beliefs of the elite"&lt;ref name="mt"/&gt;, both concepts incompatible with the traditional conception of conservatism as signifying support for the established order and existing social convention.

===United States===

{{Main|Conservatism in the United States}}
Conservatism in the [[United States]] includes a variety of political ideologies including [[fiscal conservatism]], [[supply-side economics]], [[social conservatism]], [[libertarian conservatism]], [[bioconservative|bioconservatism]] and [[religious conservatism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://atheism.about.com/library/weekly/aa070898.htm About atheism]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as support for a strong [[military]].  Modern American conservatism was largely born out of alliance between [[Classical liberalism|classical liberals]] and social conservatives in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark, B. (1998). ''Political economy: A comparative approach''. Westport, CT: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important American conservatives include [[William F. Buckley]] and [[Barry Goldwater]].

US president [[Ronald Reagan]], who was a self-declared conservative, is widely seen as a symbol of American conservatism.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=conservatism|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/conservatsm.html|encyclopedia=The Columbia Encyclopedia|year=2008|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview, he said "I believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is [[libertarianism]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reason.com/news/show/29318.html Inside Ronald Reagan], a [[Reason (magazine)|Reason magazine]] Interview with Ronald Reagan, July 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;  Organizations in the US committed to promoting conservative ideology include the [[American Conservative Union]], [[Eagle Forum]], [[Heritage Foundation]] and the [[Hoover Institution]]. US-based media outlets that are conservative include ''[[Human Events]]'', ''[[National Review]]'', ''[[The American Conservative]]'', [[Policy Review]]'', and ''[[The Weekly Standard]].''

In the US, social conservatives emphasize traditional views of social units such as the [[family]], [[Church body|church]], or [[Localism (politics)|locale]]. Social conservatism may entail defining [[marriage]] as relationships between one man and one woman (thereby prohibiting [[same-sex marriage]] and [[polygamy]]) and laws placing restrictions on the practice of [[abortion]].  While many religious conservatives believe that government should have a role in defending moral values, libertarian conservatives such as [[Barry Goldwater]] advocated a hands-off government where social values were concerned.

==Psychology==
{{Globalize|section|Frankfurt School}}
{{POV|date=August 2009}}
A meta-analysis of research literature by Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, and Sulloway in 2003 claimed that many factors, such as [[Ambiguity tolerance|intolerance of ambiguity]] and need for [[Cognitive closure (psychology)|cognitive closure]], contribute to the degree of one's political conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;Jost, J.J, Glaser, J., Kruglanski, A.A., &amp; Sulloway, F.J. (2003). Political Conservatism as Motivated Social Cognition. ''Psychological Bulletin, 129''(3), 339-375.[http://psychoanalystsopposewar.org/resources_files/ConsevatismAsMotivatedSocialCognition.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The study also stated that these traits "might be associated with such generally valued characteristics as personal commitment and unwavering loyalty," and that while both liberals and conservatives are resistant to change; liberals have a higher tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/07/22_politics.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

According to psychologist [[Robert Altemeyer]], individuals who are politically conservative tend to rank high in [[Right-wing Authoritarianism|Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA)]] on his RWA scale.&lt;ref&gt;Altemeyer, B. (1981). Right-wing Authoritarianism. Winnipeg, Canada: University of Manitoba Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A study done on Israeli and Palestinian students in Israel found that RWA scores of right-wing party supporters were significantly higher than those of left-wing party supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Rubinstein, G. (1996). Two Peoples in One Land: A Validation Study of Altemeyer's Right-Wing Authoritarianism Scale in the Palestinian and Jewish Societies in Israel. ''Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology'', ''27'', 216-230.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2005 study by H. Michael Crowson and colleagues suggested a moderate gap between RWA and other conservative positions.  While it was true that RWA partially mediated the relationship between cognitive rigidity and mainstream conservatism, "The results indicated that conservatism is not synonymous with RWA."  &lt;ref&gt;Crowson, H. Michael, Stephen J. Thoma, and Nita Hestevold. "Is Political Conservatism Synonymous with Authoritarianism?." The Journal of Social Psychology 145.5 (Oct 2005): 571(22). Expanded Academic ASAP. Gale. Remote Access. 20 May 2009&lt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7562926_Is_political_conservatism_synonymous_with_authoritarianism&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist Felicia Pratto and her colleagues have found evidence to support the idea that a high [[Social Dominance Orientation]] (SDO) is strongly correlated with conservative political views, and opposition to social engineering to promote equality&lt;ref name=pratto&gt; Pratto, F., Sidanius, J., Stallworth, L.M., &amp; Malle, B.F. (1994). Social dominance orientation: A personality variable predicting social and political attitudes. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 67(4), 741-763.&lt;/ref&gt; Pratto and her colleagues found that high SDO scores were highly correlated with measures of [[prejudice]]. The were supported in this claim by [[David J. Schneider]], who wrote that "correlations between prejudice and political conservative are reduced virtually to zero when controls for SDO are instituted" &lt;ref&gt;The psychology of stereotyping, David J. Schneider,  Guilford Press, 2005 ISBN 1593851936, 9781593851934 704 pages page 275&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Kenneth Minogue]] who wrote "It is characteristic of the conservative temperament to value established identities, to praise habit and to respect prejudice, not because it is irrational, but because such things anchor the darting impusles of human beings in solidities of custom which we do not often begin to value until we are already losing them. Radicalism often generates youth movements, while conservatism is a condition found among the mature, who have discovered what it is in life they most value." &lt;ref&gt;The Social science encyclopedia, Jessica Kuper, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1985 ISBN 0710200080, 9780710200082 916 pages pp 155-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study stated that opposition is not based on racism or sexism, but on a "principled conservatism,"&lt;ref name=sidanius96&gt;Sidanius, J., Pratto, F., &amp; Bobo, L. (1996). Racism, conservatism, affirmative action, and intellectual sophistication: A matter of principled conservatism or group dominance? ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 70''(3), 476-490.&lt;/ref&gt; a perspective based on "concern for [[Equality of opportunity|equity]], [[color-blindness]], and genuine conservative values." Furthermore, the study suggested that racism and conservatism are independent, and weakly correlated among the highly educated. In an effort to examine the relationship between education, SDO, and racism, Sidanius and his colleagues conducted a survey in which subjects were asked about their political and social attitudes.&lt;ref name=sidanius96 /&gt; Results indicated partial support for the principled-conservatism position, in that racism was not the primary force for opposition to policies such as affirmative action. However, contrary to predictions, correlations among SDO, political conservatism, and racism were strongest among the most well educated, and weakest among the least well educated.&lt;ref name=sidanius96&gt;Sidanius, J., Pratto, F., &amp; Bobo, L. (1996). Racism, conservatism, affirmative action, and intellectual sophistication: A matter of principled conservatism or group dominance? ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 70''(3), p. 486 ''Congruent with principled conservatism position (and with several other models including symbolic racism, see Sears, 1988), the data showed that opposition to affirmative action among Whites cannot be exclusively understood in terms of either anti-Black affect, classical racism, or SDO.'' p. 487 ''Although it would be a serious mistake to assume that White's opposition to redistributive policies such as affirmative action are primarily driven by either racism or group dominance motives, assuming that racism and group dominance motives become less important as intellectual sophistication among Whites increases, would be equally mistaken.''&lt;/ref&gt;
