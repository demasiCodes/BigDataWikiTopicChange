'''Conservatism''' is a [[Philosophy of culture|cultural]], [[Social philosophy|social]], and [[political philosophy]] that seeks to promote and to preserve traditional [[institution]]s, [[Convention (norm)|customs]], and [[Value (ethics and social sciences)|values]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yoram Hazony|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uhx1EAAAQBAJ|title=Conservatism: A Rediscovery|publisher=Swift Press|year=2022|pages=142–153|isbn=9781800752344}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hamilton |first1=Andrew |title=Conservatism |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/conservatism/ |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Conservatism |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/conservatism |access-date=2022-05-01 |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central tenets of conservatism may vary in relation to the [[culture]] and [[civilization]] in which it appears. In [[Western culture]], depending on the particular nation, conservatives seek to promote a range of social institutions, such as the [[nuclear family]], [[organized religion]], the [[military]], [[property rights]], and [[monarchy]]. Conservatives tend to favour institutions and practices that guarantee [[social order]] and that evolved gradually.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Edmund Burke]], an 18th-century politician who opposed the [[French Revolution]] but supported the [[American Revolution]], is credited as one of the main theorists of conservatism in the 1790s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Frank O'Gorman |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-reNJAnv1oC&amp;pg=PA171 |title=Edmund Burke: His Political Philosophy |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-415-32684-1 |page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first established use of the term in a political context originated in 1818 with [[François-René de Chateaubriand]] during the period of [[Bourbon Restoration in France|Bourbon Restoration]] that sought to roll back the policies of the French Revolution and establish social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9F7i5u4sOtgC&amp;pg=PA26 |title=Conservatism: An Anthology of Social and Political Thought from David Hume to the Present |publisher=Princeton U.P. |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-691-03711-0 |editor=Jerry Z. Muller |page=26 |quote=Terms related to 'conservative' first found their way into political discourse in the title of the French weekly journal, ''Le Conservateur'', founded in 1818 by François-René de Chateaubriand with the aid of Louis de Bonald.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Conservative thought has varied considerably as it has adapted itself to existing traditions and national cultures.{{sfn|Heywood|2012|p=66}} Thus, conservatives from different parts of the world—each upholding their respective traditions—may disagree on a wide range of issues. Historically associated with [[right-wing politics]], the term has been used to describe [[#Ideological variants|a wide range of views]]. Conservatism may be either more [[Libertarian conservatism|libertarian]] or more [[Authoritarian conservatism|authoritarian]]; more [[Right-wing populism|populist]] or more [[Traditionalist conservatism|elitist]]; more [[Progressive conservatism|progressive]] or more [[reactionary]]; more [[Moderate conservatism|moderate]] or more [[Ultraconservatism|extreme]].{{sfn|Vincent|2009|p=79}} 

== Themes ==
Some political scientists, such as [[Samuel P. Huntington]], have seen conservatism as situational. Under this definition, conservatives are seen as defending the established institutions of their time.&lt;ref&gt;Winthrop and Lovell, pp. 163–166&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg]], the chairman of the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in 1959: "Conservatism is not so much a philosophy as an attitude, a constant force, performing a timeless function in the development of a free society, and corresponding to a deep and permanent requirement of human nature itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Quintin Hogg Baron Hailsham of St. Marylebone|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=%22+attitude,+a+constant+force,+performing+a+timeless+function+in+the+development+of+a+free+society,+and+corresponding+to+a+deep+and+permanent+requirement+of+human+nature+itself%22|title=The Conservative Case|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservatism is often used as a generic term to describe a "right-wing viewpoint occupying the political spectrum between [classical] [[liberalism]] and [[fascism]]".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Tradition ===
Despite the lack of a universal definition, certain themes can be recognised as common across conservative thought. According to [[Michael Oakeshott]]:

{{blockquote|To be conservative ... is to prefer the familiar to the unknown, to prefer the tried to the untried, fact to mystery, the actual to the possible, the limited to the unbounded, the near to the distant, the sufficient to the superabundant, the convenient to the perfect, present laughter to utopian bliss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Oakeshott|first=Michael|title=Rationalism in Politics and Other Essays|publisher=Methuen|year=1962|location=London|pages=168–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Such traditionalism may be a reflection of trust in time-tested methods of social organisation, giving 'votes to the dead'.{{sfn|Heywood|2017|p=66}} Traditions may also be steeped in a sense of [[Identity (social science)|identity]].{{sfn|Heywood|2017|p=66}}

=== Hierarchy===
In contrast to the tradition-based definition of conservatism, some left-wing political theorists like [[Corey Robin]] define conservatism primarily in terms of a general defense of [[Social inequality|social]] and [[economic inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robin|first=Corey|date=January 8, 2012|title=The Conservative Mind|newspaper=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Conservative-Mind/130199/|access-date=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, conservatism is less an attempt to uphold old institutions and more "a meditation on—and theoretical rendition of—the felt experience of having power, seeing it threatened, and trying to win it back".&lt;ref&gt;Henning Finseraas, "What if Robin Hood is a social conservative? How the political response to increasing inequality depends on party polarization." ''Socio-Economic Review'' 8.2 (2010): 283–306.&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion, Robin argues for a more complex relation:

{{blockquote|Conservatism is a defense of established hierarchies, but it is also fearful of those established hierarchies. It sees in their assuredness of power the source of corruption, decadence and decline. Ruling regimes require some kind of irritant, a grain of sand in the oyster, to reactivate their latent powers, to exercise their atrophied muscles, to make their pearls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Farrell|first=Henry|date=February 1, 2018|title=Trump is a typical conservative. That says a lot about the conservative tradition.|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/02/01/trump-is-a-typical-conservative-that-says-a-lot-about-the-conservative-tradition/|access-date=August 29, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Political philosopher [[Yoram Hazony]] argues that, in a traditional conservative community, members have importance and influence to the degree they are [[Honour|honoured]] within the social hierarchy, which includes factors such as age, experience, and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yoram Hazony|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uhx1EAAAQBAJ|title=Conservatism: A Rediscovery|publisher=Swift Press|year=2022|pages=125–133| isbn=9781800752344 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word hierarchy has religious roots and translates to 'rule of a high priest.'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.etymonline.com/word/hierarchy "hierarchy"]. [[Online Etymology Dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Realism ===
Conservatism has been called a "philosophy of human imperfection" by [[Noël O'Sullivan]], reflecting among its adherents a negative view of [[human nature]] and pessimism of the potential to improve it through 'utopian' schemes.{{sfn|Heywood|2017|p=67}} The "intellectual godfather of the realist right", [[Thomas Hobbes]], argued that the [[state of nature]] for humans was "poor, nasty, brutish, and short", requiring centralised authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fawcett|first=Edmund|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TO3eDwAAQBAJ|title=Conservatism: The Fight for a Tradition|date=October 20, 2020|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-17410-5|language=en|quote=To Hobbes, the intellectual godfather of the "realist" right for whom security was the highest social value, authorities were needed as sovereign arbiters to stop people's inborn competitiveness from running out of control.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Leviathan|chapter=Chapter XIII.: Of the Natural Condition of Mankind As Concerning Their Felicity, and Misery.|chapter-url=http://www.bartleby.com/34/5/13.html|access-date=2020-11-30|archive-date=2020-12-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201204090304/https://www.bartleby.com/34/5/13.html|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Authority ===
Authority is a core tenet of conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of European Conservative Thought|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1076721952|year=2019|access-date=2023-08-29|isbn=978-1-62157-909-0|oclc=1076721952|first=Francesco|last=Giubilei|pages=18–19|publisher=Simon and Schuster }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Ashford |editor1-first=Nigel |editor2-last=Davies |editor2-first=Stephen |title=A Dictionary of Conservative and Libertarian Thought |date=September 10, 2023 |isbn=978-0-415-67046-3 |pages=14–17|publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, [[traditional authority]], according to [[Max Weber]], is "resting on an established belief in the [[Sacredness|sanctity]] of immemorial traditions and the legitimacy of those exercising authority under them"—for example parents, priests, and monarchs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Weber |first1=Max |title=[[Economy and Society]] |date=1922 |pages=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rb295&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.295&lt;/ref&gt; [[Danny Kruger]] defines conservative authority as "the non-coercive social persuasion which operates in a family or a community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kruger |first1=Danny |title=On Fraternity : Politics Beyond Liberty &amp; Equality |date=2007 |isbn=9781903386576 |pages=13|publisher=Institute for the Study of Civil Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reactionism ===
{{main article|Reactionary}}
{{see also|Far-right politics}}
Reactionism is a tradition in [[right-wing politics]] that opposes policies for the [[social transformation]] of society.&lt;ref name="Modern Thought Third Edition 1999 p. 729"&gt;''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' Third Edition, (1999) p. 729.&lt;/ref&gt; In popular usage, reactionary refers to a strong [[traditionalist conservative]] political perspective of a person opposed to social, political, and economic change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/reactionary |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191014094954/https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/reactionary |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 14, 2019 |title=reactionary |work=Lexico}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reactionary |title=reactionary |work=Merriam-Webster|date=May 9, 2023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents of conservatism often oppose certain aspects of modernity (for example [[mass culture]] and [[secularism]]) and seek a return to traditional values, though different groups of conservatives may choose different traditional values to preserve.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLean, Iain; McMillan, Alistair (2009). "Conservatism". ''Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'' (3rd ed.). Oxford University Press. "Sometimes [conservatism] has been outright opposition, based on an existing model of society that is considered right for all time. It can take a 'reactionary' form, harking back to, and attempting to reconstruct, forms of society which existed in an earlier period". {{ISBN|978-0-19-920516-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some political scientists, such as [[Corey Robin]], treat the words reactionary and conservative as synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Robin |first=Corey |title=The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism from Edmund Burke to Donald Trump |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2018 |isbn=978-0190692001 |quote=This book is about the second half of the story, the demarche, and the political ideas –– variously called conservative, reactionary, revanchist, counterrevolutionary –– that grow out of and give rise to it. |author-link=Corey Robin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Mark Lilla]], argue that reactionism and conservatism are distinct worldviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lilla |first=Mark |title=The Shipwrecked Mind: On Political Reaction |publisher=New York Review Books |year=2016 |isbn=978-1590179024 |pages=xii |chapter=Introduction |quote=Reactionaries are not conservatives. This is the first thing to be understood about them. They are, in their way, just as radical as revolutionaries and just as firmly in the grip of historical imaginings.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Wilson (political scientist)|Francis Wilson]] defines conservatism as "a philosophy of social evolution, in which certain lasting values are defended within the framework of the tension of political conflict".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Francis |title=The Case for Conservatism |date=1951 |isbn=978-1412842341 |page=2|publisher=Transaction Publishers }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reactionary is a person who holds political views that favor a return to the ''[[wikt:status quo ante|status quo ante]]'', the previous political state of society, which that person believes possessed positive characteristics absent from contemporary society. An early example of a powerful reactionary movement was [[German Romanticism]], which centered around concepts of [[Organicism#In_politics_and_sociology|organicism]], [[medievalism]], and [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalism]] against the forces of rationalism, secularism, and individualism that were unleashed in the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried Heit and Otto W. Johnston, "German Romanticism: An Ideological Response to Napoleon." ''Consortium on Revolutionary Europe 1750–1850: Proceedings'' (1980), Vol. 9, p187-197.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=De konservativa idéerna|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1166587654|publisher=Aldus/Bonniers|year=1966|access-date=2023-08-29|oclc=1166587654|first=Herbert|last=Tingsten|pages=42–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In political discourse, being a reactionary is generally regarded as negative; Peter King observed that it is "an unsought-for label, used as a torment rather than a badge of honor."&lt;ref&gt;King, Peter. Reaction: Against the modern world. Andrews UK Limited, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the descriptor has been adopted by writers such as the Italian esoteric traditionalist [[Julius Evola]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ferraresi |first=Franco |date=1987 |title=Julius Evola: Tradition, Reaction, and the Radical Right |journal=European Journal of Sociology |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=107–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Austrian monarchist [[Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn]],&lt;ref&gt;''Credo of a Reactionary'' by Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn – [[The American Mercury]], under his alias Francis Stuart Campbell&lt;/ref&gt; the Colombian [[political theology|political theologian]] [[Nicolás Gómez Dávila]], and the American historian [[John Lukacs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Confessions of an Original Sinner |isbn=9781890318123 |last1=Lukacs |first1=John |year=2000|publisher=St. Augustine's Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intellectual history ==
=== Proto-conservatism ===
{{Toryism}}
In Great Britain, the [[Tory]] movement during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period (1660–1688) was a form of proto-conservatism that supported a hierarchical society with a monarch who ruled by [[Divine right of kings|divine right]]. However, [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]] differ from most later, more moderate, mainstream conservatives in that they opposed the idea of [[popular sovereignty]] and rejected the authority of parliament and freedom of religion. [[Robert Filmer]]'s royalist treatise ''[[Patriarcha]]'' (published in 1680 but written before the [[English Civil War]] of 1642–1651) became accepted as the statement of their doctrine.

However, the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 damaged this principle by establishing a constitutional government in England, leading to the hegemony of the Tory-opposed [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] ideology. Faced with defeat, the Tories reformed their movement. They adopted more moderate conservative positions, such as holding that sovereignty was vested in the three estates of Crown, Lords, and Commons rather than solely in the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=ix, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Hooker]] (1554–1600), [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|Marquess of Halifax]] (1633–1695) and [[David Hume]] (1711–1776) were proto-conservatives of the period. Halifax promoted pragmatism in government whilst Hume argued against political rationalism and utopianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/conservatismanth00mull |title=Conservatism: an anthology of social and political thought from David Hume to the present |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1997 |editor1-last=Muller |editor1-first=Jerry Z. |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wolin |first1=Sheldon S. |date=September 2, 2013 |title=Hume and Conservatism |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=999–1016 |doi=10.2307/1951007 |jstor=1951007 |s2cid=53138291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophical founders ===
[[Edmund Burke]] (1729–1797) has been widely regarded as the philosophical founder of modern conservatism as we know it today.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Heywood, ''Political Ideologies: An Introduction''. Third Edition. (Palgrave Macmillan, 2003), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. P. Lock, ''Edmund Burke. Volume II: 1784–1797'' (Clarendon Press, 2006), p. 585.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke served as the private secretary to the [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Marquis of Rockingham]] and as official pamphleteer to the [[Rockingham Whigs|Rockingham branch of the Whig party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Edmund Burke: selected writings and speeches|last=Stanlis|first=Peter J.|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]]|year=2009|location=New York|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the Tories, they were the conservatives in the late 18th century United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Morton Auerbach|title=[[The Conservative Illusion]]|publisher=Columbia University Press (1959)|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edmund Burke by James Northcote.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Edmund Burke]] (1729–1797)]]

Burke's views were a mixture of conservatism and republicanism. He supported the [[American Revolution]] of 1775–1783 but abhorred the violence of the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799). He accepted the conservative ideals of [[private property]] and the economics of [[Adam Smith]] (1723–1790), but thought that economics should remain subordinate to the conservative social ethic, that [[capitalism]] should be subordinate to the medieval social tradition and that the business class should be subordinate to [[aristocracy]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}} He insisted on standards of [[honour]] derived from the medieval aristocratic tradition and saw the aristocracy as the nation's natural leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Conservative Illusion]]|last=Auerbach|year=1959|pages=37–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; That meant limits on the powers of the Crown, since he found the institutions of Parliament to be better informed than commissions appointed by the executive. He favored an [[established church]], but allowed for a degree of [[religious toleration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[The Conservative Illusion]]|last=Auerbach|year=1959|pages=52–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke ultimately justified the social order on the basis of tradition: tradition represented the wisdom of the species, and he valued community and social harmony over social reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[The Conservative Illusion]]|last=Auerbach|year=1959|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cogordan - Joseph de Maistre, 1894 (page 12 crop).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph de Maistre]] (1753–1821)]]

Another form of conservatism developed in France in parallel to conservatism in Britain. It was influenced by [[Counter-Enlightenment]] works by men such as [[Joseph de Maistre]] (1753–1821) and [[Louis de Bonald]] (1754–1840). Many continental conservatives do not support [[separation of church and state]], with most supporting state recognition of and cooperation with the [[Catholic Church in France|Catholic Church]], such as had existed in France before the Revolution. Conservatives were also early to embrace nationalism, which was previously associated with liberalism and the Revolution in France.&lt;ref&gt;ams, Ian Political Ideology Today (2nd edition), Manchester University Press, 2002, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Another early French conservative, [[François-René de Chateaubriand]] (1768–1848), espoused a [[Romanticism|romantic]] opposition to modernity, contrasting its emptiness with the 'full heart' of traditional faith and loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fawcett|first=Edmund|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TO3eDwAAQBAJ|title=Conservatism: The Fight for a Tradition|date=October 20, 2020|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-17410-5|language=en|quote=Little of that, though fascinating, would have won Chateaubriand a place in the story of conservatism had he not he passed down to it a repertoire of disavowal for the "empty world" of liberal modernity and a counterpart trust in the "full heart" of faith and loyalty. Chateaubriand was a Romantic among conservatism's anti-rationalist forerunners.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere on the continent, German thinkers [[Justus Möser]] (1720–1794) and [[Friedrich von Gentz]] (1764–1832) criticized the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] that came of the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fawcett|first=Edmund|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TO3eDwAAQBAJ|title=Conservatism: The Fight for a Tradition|date=October 20, 2020|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-17410-5|language=en|quote=Gentz did not mock the Declaration of the Rights of Man in the satirical manner of Justus Möser (1720–94), the north-Saxon critic of market society and Enlightenment princely reform. Nor did Gentz fault the declaration, as Burke had done, for misunderstanding the character of rights. Gentz instead subjected the declaration to an article-by-article critique (1793) for errors of drafting and logic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition was also expressed by [[Adam Müller]] (1779–1829) and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1771–1830), the latter inspiring both left and right-wing followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fawcett|first=Edmund|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TO3eDwAAQBAJ|title=Conservatism: The Fight for a Tradition|date=October 20, 2020|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-17410-5|language=en|quote=Less well-known thinkers who influenced later German conservatives were against revolution from the outset . . .

The Terror, on that understanding, was a contingent horror, as a little part of intelligible human history, Hegel wrote, as "chopping the head off a cabbage." . . . After his death, Hegel's heritage divided like the French assembly into right and left.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideological variants ==
=== Liberal conservatism ===

{{Distinguish|Conservative liberalism}}
[[File:P061521-697284 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ulf Kristersson]], leader of the liberal-conservative [[Moderate Party]] and incumbent [[Prime Minister of Sweden]]]]
Liberal conservatism incorporates the [[classical liberal]] view of minimal government intervention in the economy. Individuals should be free to participate in the market and generate wealth without government interference.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} However, individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life; therefore, liberal conservatives believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order and social institutions are needed to nurture a sense of duty and responsibility to the nation.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} Liberal conservatism is a variant of conservatism that is strongly influenced by [[Liberalism|liberal]] stances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGNRRwkZFysC&amp;pg=PA109|title=Analyzing Politics|last=Grigsby|first=Ellen|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2008|isbn=978-0-495-50112-1|pages=108–109, 112, 347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As these latter two terms have had different meanings over time and across countries, liberal conservatism also has a wide variety of meanings. Historically, the term often referred to the combination of [[economic liberalism]], which champions ''[[laissez-faire]]'' markets, with the classical conservatism concern for established [[tradition]], respect for authority and religious values. It contrasted itself with [[classical liberalism]], which supported [[freedom for the individual]] in both the economic and social spheres.

Over time, the general conservative ideology in many countries adopted fiscally conservative arguments and the term liberal conservatism was replaced with conservatism. This is also the case in countries where liberal economic ideas have been the tradition such as the United States and are thus considered conservative. In other countries where liberal conservative movements have entered the political mainstream, such as [[Italy]] and [[Spain]], the terms liberal and conservative may be synonymous. The liberal conservative tradition in the United States combines the economic [[individualism]] of the classical liberals with a [[Burkean]] form of conservatism (which has also become part of the [[American conservative]] tradition, such as in the writings of [[Russell Kirk]]).

A secondary meaning for the term liberal conservatism that has developed in [[Europe]] is a combination of more modern conservative (less traditionalist) views with those of [[social liberalism]]. This has developed as an opposition to the more [[Collectivism and individualism|collectivist]] views of [[socialism]]. Often this involves stressing conservative views of [[free market]] economics and belief in individual responsibility, with [[communitarian]] views on defence of [[civil rights]], [[environmentalism]] and support for a limited [[welfare state]]. In continental Europe, this is sometimes also translated into English as social conservatism.

=== Libertarian conservatism ===
{{main|Libertarian conservatism}}
Libertarian conservatism describes certain political ideologies most prominently within the United States which combine [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] economic issues with aspects of conservatism. Its four main branches are [[constitutionalism]], [[paleolibertarianism]], [[American conservatism|small government conservatism]] and [[Christian libertarianism]]. They generally differ from [[Paleoconservatism|paleoconservatives]], in that they favor more [[liberty|personal]] and [[economic freedom]]. [[Agorist]]s such as [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]] labeled libertarian conservatism [[right-libertarianism]].&lt;ref name="nlm"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Libertarian Manifesto |url=http://agorism.info/NewLibertarianManifesto.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223021118/http://www.agorism.info/NewLibertarianManifesto.pdf |archive-date=February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaz.org/~dan/individualist-anarchist/software/konkin-interview.html|title=Interview With Samuel Edward Konkin III|website=www.spaz.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to paleoconservatives, libertarian conservatives support strict ''laissez-faire'' policies such as [[free trade]], opposition to any national bank and opposition to [[regulations|business regulations]]. They are often opposed to [[environmental regulation]]s, [[corporate welfare]], [[subsidies]] and other areas of economic intervention. Many conservatives, especially in the United States, believe that the government should not play a major role in regulating business and managing the economy. They typically oppose efforts to charge high tax rates and to redistribute income to assist the poor. Such efforts, they argue, only serve to exacerbate the scourge of unemployment and poverty by lessening the ability for businesses to hire employees due to higher tax impositions.

=== Fiscal conservatism ===
{{main|Fiscal conservatism}}
[[File:TeaPartyByFreedomFan.JPG|thumb|2009 [[Taxpayer March on Washington]] as conservative protesters walk down [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]], Washington, D.C.]]
Fiscal conservatism is the economic philosophy of prudence in government spending and debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B10JkvO82x8C&amp;pg=PA109|title=Correctional Organization and Management: Public Policy Challenges, Behavior, and Structure|first=Robert M.|last=Freeman|publisher=Elsevier|year=1999|page=109|isbn=978-0-7506-9897-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), Edmund Burke argued that a government does not have the right to run up large debts and then throw the burden on the taxpayer: {{Blockquote|[I]t is to the property of the citizen, and not to the demands of the creditor of the state, that the first and original faith of civil society is pledged. The claim of the citizen is prior in time, paramount in title, superior in equity. The fortunes of individuals, whether possessed by acquisition or by descent or in virtue of a participation in the goods of some community, were no part of the creditor's security, expressed or implied...[T]he public, whether represented by a monarch or by a senate, can pledge nothing but the public estate; and it can have no public estate except in what it derives from a just and proportioned imposition upon the citizens at large.}}

=== National conservatism ===

National conservatism is heavily oriented towards the traditional [[family]] and social stability as well as in favour of limiting [[immigration]]. As such, national conservatives can be distinguished from economic conservatives, for whom free market economic policies, [[deregulation]] and fiscal conservatism are the main priorities. Some commentators have identified a growing gap between national and economic conservatism: "[M]ost parties of the Right [today] are run by economic conservatives who, in varying degrees, have marginalized social, cultural, and national conservatives."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041121224135/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n12_v49/ai_19559422 National questions – conservatives fragmenting as liberals unite], National Review, June 30, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditionalist conservatism===
{{main|Traditional conservatism}}
Traditionalist conservatism is a political philosophy emphasizing the need for the principles of [[natural law]] and transcendent moral order, [[tradition]], [[hierarchy]] and [[organic unity]], [[agrarianism]], [[classicism]] and [[high culture]] as well as the intersecting spheres of loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson, ed. (2006) ''American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia'' Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, pp. 870–875&lt;/ref&gt; Some traditionalists have embraced the labels "[[reactionary]]" and "[[counterrevolution]]ary," defying the stigma that has attached to these terms since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Having a hierarchical view of society, many traditionalist conservatives, including a few Americans (notable examples including [[Ralph Adams Cram]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cram|first=Ralph Adams|title=Invitation to Monarchy|url=https://archive.org/details/invitation-to-monarchy-by-ralph-adams-cram|date=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solange Hertz]],&lt;ref&gt;Hertz, Solange. ''Democracy, Monarchy and the Fourth Commandment''&lt;/ref&gt; [[William S. Lind]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lind|first=William S.|title=The Prussian Monarchy Stuff|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/lind/lind103.html|website=LewRockwell.com|publisher=Center for Libertarian Studies|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; [[Charles A. Coulombe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What's the Cure for Ailing Nations?

=== Cultural conservatism ===
{{main|Cultural conservatism}}
Cultural conservatives support the preservation of the heritage of one nation, or of a shared culture that is not defined by national boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RbwDNb5jtzUC |title=Cultural Conservatism, Political Liberalism: From Criticism to Cultural Studies |first=James |last=Seaton |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-472-10645-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shared culture may be as divergent as [[Western culture]] or [[Chinese culture]]. In the United States, the term "cultural conservative" may imply a conservative position in the [[culture war]]. Cultural conservatives hold fast to traditional ways of thinking even in the face of monumental change. They believe strongly in traditional values and traditional politics and often have an urgent sense of nationalism.

=== Social conservatism ===
{{main|Social conservatism}}
Social conservatism is distinct from cultural conservatism, although there are some overlaps. Social conservatives may believe that society is built upon a fragile network of relationships which need to be upheld through duty, traditional values and established institutions;{{sfn|Heywood|2017|p=69}} and that the government has a role in encouraging or enforcing traditional values or behaviours. A social conservative wants to preserve traditional morality and social mores, often by opposing what they consider radical policies or [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]]. Social change is generally regarded as suspect.

Social conservatives today generally favour the [[anti-abortion]] position in the [[abortion controversy]] and oppose human [[embryonic stem cell]] research (particularly if publicly funded); oppose both [[eugenics]] and [[human enhancement]] ([[transhumanism]]) while supporting [[bioconservatism]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utne.com/2005-01-01/TheNextDigitalDivide.aspx?page=2 The Next Digital Divide] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606100135/http://www.utne.com/2005-01-01/TheNextDigitalDivide.aspx?page=2 |date=2011-06-06 }} (utne article)&lt;/ref&gt; support a traditional definition of marriage as being one man and one woman; view the [[nuclear family]] model as society's foundational unit; oppose expansion of [[civil marriage]] and [[child adoption]] to couples in [[same-sex relationship]]s; promote [[public morality]] and traditional [[family values]]; oppose [[atheism]], especially militant atheism, and [[secularism]];&lt;ref name="MA1"&gt;{{cite magazine| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VayGAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22conservatism%22+%22militant+atheism%22|magazine=The World &amp; I|title=The World &amp; I|quote=militant atheism was incompatible with conservatism|volume=1|issue=5|publisher=Washington Times Corp.|access-date =August 19, 2011| year = 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "MA2"&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9dgvDn9hoe0C&amp;q=social%20conservatism%20militant%20atheism&amp;pg=PA264|title=The Routledge Companion to Fascism and the Far Right|quote=In addition, conservative Christians often endorsed far-right regimes as the lesser of two evils, especially when confronted with militant atheism in the USSR.|author1=Peter Davies |author2=Derek Lynch |publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|access-date =August 19, 2011| isbn = 978-0-415-21494-0| year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Secularism"&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SRrwirez3fQC&amp;pg=PA57|title=Religious America, Secular Europe?: A Theme and Variations|quote=If anything the reverse is true: moral conservatives continue to oppose secular liberals on a wide range of issues.|author1=Peter L.

=== Religious conservatism {{anchor|Religious conservatism}} ===
{{see also|Conservative Christianity|Christian democracy|Christian right|Islamism|Hindu nationalism| Hindutva|Religious fundamentalism}}
[[File:Marche pour la vie 2012 - 6.jpg|thumb|2012 [[March for Life (Paris)|March for Life]] in [[Paris]], [[France]]]]
Religious conservatism principally applies the teachings of particular religions to politics: sometimes by merely proclaiming the value of those teachings; at other times, by having those teachings influence laws.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Margaret L., Taylor, Howard Francis. [https://books.google.com/books?id=LP9bIrZ9xacC&amp;pg=PA469 ''Sociology: Understanding a Diverse Society''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221205101215/https://books.google.com/books?id=LP9bIrZ9xacC&amp;pg=PA469 |date=December 5, 2022 }} Cengage Learning, 4th Ed. (2005), pp. 469–470. {{ISBN|978-0-534-61716-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most democracies, political conservatism seeks to uphold traditional family structures and social values. Religious conservatives typically oppose abortion, [[LGBT]] behavior (or, in certain cases, identity), drug use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/sanctity/chdrugsrev2.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020142532/http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/sanctity/chdrugsrev2.shtml|url-status= dead|title=So Christians do not approve of the taking of illegal drugs, including most recreational drugs, especially those which can alter the mind and make people incapable of praying or being alert to God.|archive-date=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sexual activity outside of marriage. In some cases, conservative values are grounded in religious beliefs, and conservatives seek to increase the role of religion in public life.&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, David L. (2005). "Genesis and Family Values". ''Journal of Biblical Literature''. '''124''' (1).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paternalistic conservatism ===
{{main|Paternalistic conservatism}}
Paternalistic conservatism is a strand in conservatism which reflects the belief that societies exist and develop organically and that members within them have obligations towards each other.{{sfn|Heywood|2013|p=34}} There is particular emphasis on the [[Noblesse oblige|paternalistic obligation]] of those who are [[Social privilege|privileged]] and [[wealth]]y to the [[Poverty|poorer parts of society]]. Since it is consistent with principles such as [[Organic unity|organicism]], [[hierarchy]] and [[duty]], it can be seen as an outgrowth of [[traditional conservatism]]. Paternal conservatives support neither the [[individual]] nor the [[State (polity)|state]] in principle, but are instead prepared to support either or recommend a balance between the two depending on what is most practical.{{sfn|Heywood|2012|p=80}} Paternalistic conservatives historically favor a more [[aristocratic]] view (as opposed to the more monarchist traditionalist conservatism) and are ideologically related to [[High Tories]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}}

In more contemporary times, its proponents stress the importance of a [[social safety net]] to deal with [[poverty]], support for limited [[redistribution of wealth]] along with government regulation of markets in the interests of both consumers and producers.&lt;ref name="Patrick Dunleavy 2000. pp. 107–108"&gt;Patrick Dunleavy, Paul Joseph Kelly, Michael Moran. ''British Political Science: Fifty Years of Political Studies''. Oxford, England, UK; Malden, Massachusetts, US: Wiley-Blackwell, 2000. pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt; Paternalistic conservatism first arose as a distinct ideology in the [[United Kingdom]] under Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]]'s "[[One nation conservatism|One Nation]]" [[Toryism]].&lt;ref name="Patrick Dunleavy 2000. pp. 107–108"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Blake. Disraeli. Second Edition. London, England, UK: Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode (Publishers) Ltd, 1967. p. 524&lt;/ref&gt; There have been a variety of one nation conservative governments.

The Tory Party: its policies, divisions and future. Penguin, 1978. p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; were or are one nation conservatives.

In [[Germany]], during the 19th-century [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] adopted policies of state-organized compulsory insurance for workers against sickness, accident, incapacity and old age. Chancellor [[Leo von Caprivi]] promoted a conservative agenda called the "New Course".&lt;ref&gt;John Alden Nichols. ''Germany after Bismarck, the Caprivi era, 1890–1894: Issue 5''. Harvard University Press, 1958. p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Progressive conservatism ===
{{main|Progressive conservatism}}
In the United States, [[Theodore Roosevelt]] has been the main figure identified with progressive conservatism as a political tradition. Roosevelt stated that he had "always believed that wise progressivism and wise conservatism go hand in hand".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] administration of President [[William Howard Taft]] was a progressive conservative and he described himself as "a believer in progressive conservatism"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Jonathan Lurie.

Political scientist [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] has examined the class basis of right-wing extremist politics in the 1920–1960 era. He reports:
{{blockquote|Conservative or rightist extremist movements have arisen at different periods in modern history, ranging from the [[Miklós Horthy|Horthyites]] in Hungary, the [[Engelbert Dollfuss|Christian Social Party of Dollfuss in Austria]], ''[[Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Der Stahlhelm]]'' and other nationalists in pre-Hitler Germany, and [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar in Portugal]], to the pre-1966 [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] movements and the monarchists in contemporary France and Italy. The right extremists are conservative, not revolutionary. They seek to change political institutions in order to preserve or restore cultural and economic ones, while extremists of the [[Centrism|centre]] and [[Left-wing politics|left]] seek to use political means for cultural and social revolution. The ideal of the right extremist is not a totalitarian ruler, but a monarch, or a traditionalist who acts like one. Many such movements in Spain, Austria, Hungary, Germany, and Italy have been explicitly monarchist... The supporters of these movements differ from those of the centrists, tending to be wealthier, and more religious, which is more important in terms of a potential for mass support.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour M. Lipset, "Social Stratification and 'Right-Wing Extremism{{' "}} ''British Journal of Sociology'' 10#4 (1959), pp. 346–382 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/587800 on-line] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220422185441/https://www.jstor.org/stable/587800 |date=April 22, 2022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== National variants ==
Conservative political parties vary widely from country to country in the goals they wish to achieve. Both conservative and [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] parties tend to favor private ownership of property, in opposition to communist, socialist and green parties, which favor communal ownership or laws requiring social responsibility on the part of property owners. Where conservatives and social liberals differ is primarily on social issues, where conservatives tend to reject behavior that does not conform to some [[social norm]]. Modern conservative parties often define themselves by their opposition to liberal or socialist parties. The United States usage of the term conservative is unique to that country.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Alan. ''Political Parties and Party Systems''.

{{Main|Conservatism in South Korea}}
[[South Korea]]'s major conservative party, the [[People Power Party (South Korea)]], has changed its form throughout its history. First it was the Democratic-Liberal Party(민주자유당, Minju Ja-yudang) and its first head was [[Roh Tae-woo]] who was the first President of the [[Sixth Republic of South Korea]]. Democratic-Liberal Party was founded by the merging of [[Roh Tae-woo]]'s [[Democratic Justice Party]], [[Kim Young Sam]]'s [[Reunification Democratic Party]] and [[Kim Jong-pil]]'s New Democratic Republican Party. And again through election its second leader, [[Kim Young-sam]], became the fourteenth President of Korea. When the conservative party was beaten by the opposition party in the general election, it changed its form again to follow the party members' demand for reforms. It became the New Korean Party, but it changed again one year later since the President Kim Young-sam was blamed by the citizen for the [[International Monetary Fund]].{{clarify|date=March 2014}} It changed its name to Grand National Party (GNP). Since the late [[Kim Dae-jung]] assumed the presidency in 1998, GNP had been the opposition party until [[Lee Myung-bak]] won the presidential election of [[2007 South Korean presidential election|2007]].

=== Europe===
European conservatism has taken many different expressions. In Italy, which was united by liberals and radicals (''[[Risorgimento]]''), liberals, not conservatives, emerged as the party of the right.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Denis Mack. ''Modern Italy: a political history''. University of Michigan Press, 1997. {{ISBN|978-0-472-10895-4}} p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; In the Netherlands, conservatives merged into a new Christian democratic party in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Daalder, Hans and Irwin, Galen A. ''Politics in the Netherlands: how much change?'' Routledge, 1989. {{ISBN|0-7146-3361-5}} pp. 154–157&lt;/ref&gt; During the first half of the 20th century, when [[socialism]] was gaining power around the world, conservatism in countries such as Austria, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Portugal and Spain transformed into the [[Far-right politics|far-right]], becoming more [[Authoritarian conservatism|authoritarian]] and [[Ultraconservatism|extreme]].&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn, Martin.

==== Belgium ====
Having its roots in the conservative [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Party]], the [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Christian People's Party]] retained a conservative edge through the twentieth century, supporting the king in the [[Royal Question]], supporting [[nuclear family]] as the cornerstone of society, defending Christian education, and opposing [[euthanasia]]. The Christian People's Party dominated politics in post-war Belgium. In 1999, the party's support collapsed, and it became the country's fifth-largest party.&lt;ref&gt;Annesley, Claire.

==== Denmark ====
{{Conservatism in Denmark}}
Danish conservatism emerged with the political grouping ''[[Højre]]'' (literally "[[Right-wing politics|Right"]]), which due to its alliance with king [[Christian IX of Denmark]] dominated Danish politics and formed all governments from 1865 to 1901. When a constitutional reform in 1915 stripped the landed gentry of political power, Højre was succeeded by the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party of Denmark]], which has since then been the main Danish conservative party.&lt;ref name=Egander&gt;{{cite web |last1=Skov |first1=Christian Egander |title=Konservatisme |url=https://danmarkshistorien.dk/vis/materiale/konservatisme |website=danmarkshistorien.dk |access-date=17 July 2023 |language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another Danish conservative party was the [[Free Conservatives]] who were active between 1902 and 1920. The Conservative People's Party led the government coalition from 1982 to 1993. The party had previously been member of various governments from 1916 to 1917, 1940 to 1945, 1950 to 1953 and 1968 to 1971. The party was a junior partner in governments led by the [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberals]] from 2001 to 2011&lt;ref&gt;Annesley, Claire. ''A political and economic dictionary of Western Europe''. London: Routledge, 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-85743-214-5}}, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;  and again from 2016 to 2019. The party is preceded by 11 years by the [[Young Conservatives (Denmark)|Young Conservatives (KU)]], today the youth movement of the party. 

The Conservative People's Party had a stable electoral support close to 15 to 20% at almost all general elections from 1918 to 1971. In the 1970s it declined to around 5%, but then under the leadership of [[Poul Schlüter]] reached its highest popularity level ever in 1984, receiving almost every fourth vote. Since the late 1990s the party has obtained around 5 to 10% of the vote. In the [[2022 Danish general election]], the party received 5.5% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kosiara-Pedersen |first1=Karina |title=Det Konservative Folkeparti |url=https://denstoredanske.lex.dk/Det_Konservative_Folkeparti |website=Den Store Danske |access-date=17 July 2023 |language=da |date=10 July 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative thinking has also influenced other Danish political parties. In 1995 the [[Danish People's Party]] was founded, based on a mixture of conservative, national and social democratic ideas.&lt;ref name=Egander/&gt; In 2015 the party [[New Right (Denmark)|New Right]] was established, professing a national conservative attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Abildlund |first1=Andreas |title=Den konservative højrefløj er gået i udbrud |url=https://www.information.dk/moti/2015/10/konservative-hoejrefloej-gaaet-udbrud |work=Information |date=9 October 2015 |language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2022 Danish general election]], the two parties received 2.6 and 3.7% of the vote, respectively.

The conservative parties in Denmark have always considered the [[Monarchy of Denmark|monarchy]] as a central institution in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;''Critique – Idédebat og kulturkamp'', 2 December 2010: [https://aarsskriftet-critique.dk/2010/12/konservatismen-og-kongedommet/ "Konservatismen og kongedømmet"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220319072551/https://aarsskriftet-critique.dk/2010/12/konservatismen-og-kongedommet/ |date=March 19, 2022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Folketinget]]'': [https://www.ft.dk/da/partier/om-politiske-partier/partiernes-historie "Partiernes historie"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200313003717/https://www.ft.dk/da/partier/om-politiske-partier/partiernes-historie |date=March 13, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Berlingske]]'', 8 July 2014: [https://www.berlingske.dk/kommentatorer/kongehuset-bringer-danskerne-sammen "Kongehuset bringer danskerne sammen"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220318204201/https://www.berlingske.dk/kommentatorer/kongehuset-bringer-danskerne-sammen |date=March 18, 2022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Det Konservative Folkeparti]]'': [https://konservative.dk/politik/is/vi-elsker-kongehuset/ "Vi elsker Kongehuset"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220319072551/https://konservative.dk/politik/is/vi-elsker-kongehuset/ |date=March 19, 2022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Finland ====
The conservative party in Finland is the [[National Coalition Party]] (in Finnish ''Kansallinen Kokoomus'', ''Kok''). The party was founded in 1918, when several monarchist parties united. Although in the past the party was right-wing, today it is a moderate liberal conservative party. While the party advocates [[economic liberalism]], it is committed to the [[social market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Siaroff, Alan.

France since 1930s'' (1974) pp. 3–25&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Second World War, conservatives in France supported Gaullist groups and have been nationalistic and emphasized tradition, order and the regeneration of France.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Vinen, "The Parti républicain de la Liberté and the Reconstruction of French Conservatism, 1944–1951", ''French History'' (1993) 7#2 pp. 183–204&lt;/ref&gt; Gaullists held divergent views on social issues. The number of conservative groups, their lack of stability and their tendency to be identified with local issues defy simple categorization.

==== Germany ====
{{main|Conservatism in Germany}}
{{Conservatism in Germany}}
Conservatism developed alongside nationalism in Germany, culminating in Germany's victory over France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the creation of the unified [[German Empire]] in 1871 and the simultaneous rise of [[Otto von Bismarck]] on the European political stage. Bismarck's "balance of power" model maintained peace in Europe for decades at the end of the 19th century. His "revolutionary conservatism" was a conservative state-building strategy designed to make ordinary Germans—not just the Junker elite—more loyal to state and emperor, he created the modern welfare state in Germany in the 1880s. According to [[Kees van Kersbergen]] and Barbara Vis, his strategy was: {{Blockquote|[G]ranting social rights to enhance the integration of a hierarchical society, to forge a bond between workers and the state so as to strengthen the latter, to maintain traditional relations of authority between social and status groups, and to provide a countervailing power against the modernist forces of liberalism and socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kersbergen|first1=Kees van|last2=Vis|first2=Barbara|title=Comparative Welfare State Politics: Development, Opportunities, and Reform|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQL3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38|year=2013|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=38|isbn=978-1-107-65247-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Bismarck also enacted universal male suffrage in the new German Empire in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=Robert Laurence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PeoqKSxiOu4C&amp;pg=PA226|title=The American Century in Europe|last2=Vaudagna|first2=Maurizio|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8014-4075-5|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a great hero to German conservatives, who erected many monuments to his memory after he left office in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frankel|first=Richard|year=2003|title=From the Beer Halls to the Halls of Power: The Cult of Bismarck and the Legitimization of a New German Right, 1898–1945|journal=German Studies Review|volume=26|issue=3|pages=543–560|doi=10.2307/1432746|jstor=1432746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of [[Nazism]] in 1933, [[agrarianism|agrarian movements]] faded and was supplanted by a more command-based economy and forced social integration. Though [[Adolf Hitler]] succeeded in garnering the support of many German industrialists, prominent traditionalists openly and secretly opposed his policies of euthanasia, genocide and attacks on organized religion, including [[Claus von Stauffenberg]], [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], [[Henning von Tresckow]], Bishop [[Clemens August Graf von Galen]] and the monarchist [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler]].

More recently, the work of conservative [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] leader and Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] helped bring about [[German reunification]], along with the closer [[European integration]] in the form of the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. Today, German conservatism is often associated with politicians such as Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]], whose tenure has been marked by attempts to save the common European currency ([[Euro]]) from demise. The German conservatives are divided under Merkel due to the refugee crisis in Germany and many conservatives in the [[CDU/CSU]] oppose the refugee and migrant policies developed under Merkel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael John Williams|date=February 12, 2020|title=The German Center Does Not Hold|url=https://atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/the-german-center-does-not-hold/|work=New Atlanticist|access-date=March 7, 2020|archive-date=June 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200620010611/https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/the-german-center-does-not-hold/|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Greece ====
{{Conservatism in Greece sidebar}}
The main inter-war conservative party was called the [[People's Party (Greece)|People's Party]] (PP), which supported [[Greek monarchy|constitutional monarchy]] and opposed the [[Second Hellenic Republic|republican]] [[Liberal Party (Greece)|Liberal Party]]. Both it and the Liberal party were suppressed by the authoritarian, arch-conservative and royalist [[4th of August Regime]] of [[Ioannis Metaxas]] in 1936–1941. The PP was able to re-group after the Second World War as part of a United Nationalist Front which achieved power campaigning on a simple anticommunist, nationalist platform during the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946–1949). However, the vote received by the PP declined during the so-called "Centrist Interlude" in 1950–1952. In 1952, Marshal [[Alexandros Papagos]] created the [[Greek Rally]] as an umbrella for the right-wing forces. The Greek Rally came to power in 1952 and remained the leading party in Greece until 1963—after Papagos' death in 1955 reformed as the [[National Radical Union]] under [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]]. Right-wing governments backed by the palace and the army overthrew the [[Centre Union]] government in 1965 and governed the country until the establishment of the far-right [[Greek junta]] (1967–1974). After the [[metapolitefsi|regime's collapse]] in August 1974, Karamanlis returned from exile to lead the government and founded the [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party. The new conservative party had four objectives: to confront [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish expansionism in Cyprus]], to reestablish and solidify democratic rule, to give the country a strong government and to make a powerful moderate party a force in Greek politics.&lt;ref&gt;Penniman, Howard Rae. ''Greece at the polls: the national elections of 1974 and 1977''. Washington: American Enterprise Institute, 1981. {{ISBN|978-0-8447-3434-7}} pp. 49–59&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Independent Greeks]], a newly formed political party in [[Greece]], has also supported conservatism, particularly [[National conservatism|national]] and [[religious conservatism]]. The Founding Declaration of the Independent Greeks strongly emphasises in the preservation of the Greek state and its [[sovereignty]], the [[Greek people]] and the [[Greek Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anexartitoiellines.gr/404-error.php|title=Ανεξάρτητοι Έλληνες – 404 error|website=anexartitoiellines.gr|access-date=August 30, 2020|archive-date=August 4, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804120345/http://anexartitoiellines.gr/404-error.php|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Iceland ====
Founded in 1924 as the [[Conservative Party (Iceland)|Conservative Party]], Iceland's [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]] adopted its current name in 1929 after the merger with the [[Liberal Party (Iceland, historical)|Liberal Party]]. From the beginning, they have been the largest vote-winning party, averaging around 40%. They combined liberalism and conservatism, supported nationalization of infrastructure and opposed class conflict. While mostly in opposition during the 1930s, they embraced [[economic liberalism]], but accepted the welfare state after the war and participated in governments supportive of state intervention and protectionism. Unlike other Scandanivian conservative (and liberal) parties, it has always had a large working-class following.&lt;ref&gt;Grofman, Bernard and Lijpart, Arend, editors.

After [[World War I]], the country saw the emergence of its first mass parties, notably including the [[Italian People's Party (1919)|Italian People's Party]] (PPI), a Christian-democratic party that sought to represent the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] majority, which had long refrained from politics. The PPI and the [[Italian Socialist Party]] decisively contributed to the loss of strength and authority of the old liberal ruling class, which had not been able to structure itself into a proper party: the [[Liberal Union (Italy)|Liberal Union]] was not a coherent one and the [[Italian Liberal Party]] came too late. In 1921 [[Benito Mussolini]] gave birth to the [[National Fascist Party]] (PNF), and the next year, through the [[March on Rome]], he was appointed [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]]. In 1926 all parties were dissolved except the PNF, which thus remained the only legal party in the [[Kingdom of Italy]] until the fall of the regime in July 1943.

By 1945, Fascists were discredited,&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Fella, and Carlo Ruzza, ''Re-inventing the Italian Right: Territorial politics, populism and 'post-fascism'.'' (Routledge, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; disbanded and outlawed, while Mussolini was executed in April that year. After [[World War II]], the centre-right was dominated by the centrist [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] (DC) party, which included both conservative and centre-left elements. With its landslide victory over the [[Italian Socialist Party]] and the [[Italian Communist Party]] in 1948, the political centre was in power. In [[Denis Mack Smith]]'s words, it was "moderately conservative, reasonably tolerant of everything which did not touch religion or property, but above all Catholic and sometimes clerical." It dominated politics until DC's dissolution in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Pepijn Corduwener, ''The Problem of Democracy in Postwar Europe: Political Actors and the Formation of the Postwar Model of Democracy in France, West Germany and Italy'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 2016), pp. 15, 17, 27, 40, 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denis Mack Smith, ''Modern Italy: A Political History'' (1997), pp. 491––496.&lt;/ref&gt; Among DC's frequent allies, there was the conservative-liberal [[Italian Liberal Party]]. At the right of the DC stood monarchist parties like the [[Monarchist National Party]] and the post-fascist [[Italian Social Movement]] (MSI).

In 1994, entrepreneur and media tycoon [[Silvio Berlusconi]] founded [[Forza Italia]] (FI), a liberal-conservative party. Berlusconi won three elections in [[1994 Italian general election|1994]], [[2001 Italian general election|2001]], and [[2008 Italian general election|2008]], governing the country for almost ten years as Prime Minister. FI formed a coalitions with several parties, including the national-conservative [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] (AN), heir of the MSI, and the regionalist [[Lega Nord]] (LN). FI was briefly incorporated, along with AN, in [[The People of Freedom]] party and later revived in the new [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniele Albertazzi, et al., eds. ''Resisting the tide: cultures of opposition under Berlusconi (2001–06)'' (Bloomsbury Publishing USA, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[2018 Italian general election|2018 general election]], the LN and the [[Five Star Movement]] formed a populist government, which lasted about a year.&lt;ref&gt;Antonino Castaldo, and Luca Verzichelli. "Technocratic populism in Italy after Berlusconi: The trendsetter and his disciples." ''Politics and Governance'' 8.4 (2020): 485–495.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2022 Italian general election|2022 general election]] the [[Centre-right coalition (Italy)|centre-right coalition]], this time dominated by [[Brothers of Italy]] (FdI), a new conservative party born on the ashes of AN. Consequently, FdI, the re-branded [[Lega (political party)|Lega]] and FI formed a government under FdI leader [[Giorgia Meloni]].

==== Luxembourg ====
Luxembourg's major conservative party, the [[Christian Social People's Party]] (CSV or PCS), was formed as the Party of the Right in 1914 and adopted its present name in 1945. It was consistently the largest political party in Luxembourg, and dominated politics throughout the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Urwin, Derek W.

==== Norway ====
The [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party of Norway]] (Norwegian: Høyre, literally "[[Right-wing politics|right"]]) was formed by the old upper class of state officials and wealthy merchants to fight the populist democracy of the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]], but lost power in 1884, when parliamentarian government was first practised. It formed its first government under parliamentarism in 1889 and continued to alternate in power with the Liberals until the 1930s, when Labour became the dominant political party. It has elements both of paternalism, stressing the responsibilities of the state, and of economic liberalism. It first returned to power in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Knut Heidar|Heidar, Knut]].

==== Russia ====
{{Conservatism in Russia}}
Under [[Vladimir Putin]], the dominant leader since 1999, Russia has promoted explicitly conservative policies in social, cultural and political matters, both at home and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Prozorov, "Russian conservatism in the Putin presidency: The dispersion of a hegemonic discourse." ''Journal of Political Ideologies'' 10.2 (2005): 121–143 [https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/84604/1/DIIS2004-20.pdf online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210606061501/https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/84604/1/DIIS2004-20.pdf |date=June 6, 2021 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Putin has criticized [[globalism]] and [[economic liberalism]], claiming that "liberalism has become obsolete" and that the vast majority of people in the world oppose [[multiculturalism]], [[free immigration]], and [[LGBT rights by country or territory|rights for LGBT people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date= 27 June 2019|editor1-last=Tiounine|editor1-first=Margot|editor2-last=Hannen|editor2-first=Tom|work=[[Financial Times]]|title=Liberalism 'has outlived its purpose' — President Putin speaks exclusively to the Financial Times|url=https://www.ft.com/video/a49cfa25-610e-438c-b11d-5dac19619e08|language=en-GB|access-date=14 October 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian conservatism is special in some respects as it supports a [[mixed economy]] with [[Economic interventionism|economic intervention]], combined with a strong [[Russian nationalism|nationalist sentiment]] and [[social conservatism]] which is largely [[Right-wing populism|populist]]. Russian conservatism as a result opposes [[Right-libertarianism|libertarian]] ideals such as the aforementioned concept of [[economic liberalism]] found in other conservative movements around the world.

Putin has also promoted new [[think tank]]s that bring together like-minded intellectuals and writers. For example, the [[Izborsky Club]], founded in 2012 by [[Alexander Prokhanov]], stresses Russian nationalism, the restoration of Russia's historical greatness, and systematic opposition to liberal ideas and policies.&lt;ref&gt;Marlene Laruelle, "The Izborsky Club, or the new conservative avant‐garde in Russia."

''Journal of Communist Studies and Transition Politics'' 27#2 (2011): 143–165.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cultural and social affairs, Putin has collaborated closely with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. Under [[Patriarch Kirill of Moscow]], the Church has backed the expansion of Russian power into Crimea and eastern Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Woods, "How the Russian Orthodox Church is backing Vladimir Putin's new world order" [http://www.christiantoday.com/article/how.the.russian.orthodox.church.is.backing.vladimir.putins.new.world.order/81108.htm ''Christian Today'' March 3, 2016] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304015051/http://www.christiantoday.com/article/how.the.russian.orthodox.church.is.backing.vladimir.putins.new.world.order/81108.htm |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reports in September 2016 how the Church's policy prescriptions support the Kremlin's appeal to social conservatives:&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Higgins, "In Expanding Russian Influence, Faith Combines With Firepower", [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/world/europe/russia-orthodox-church.html ''New York Times'' Sept 13, 2016] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191110031305/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/world/europe/russia-orthodox-church.html |date=November 10, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of conservative parties in Switzerland's parliament, the Federal Assembly. These include the largest, the [[Swiss People's Party]] (SVP),&lt;ref name="Hans-Georg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ziebertz|first=Hans-Georg|title=How Teachers in Europe Teach Religion: An International Empirical Study: An International Empirical Study in 16 Countries|year=2011|publisher=Lit Verlag|isbn=978-3-643-10043-6|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland|Christian Democratic People's Party]] (CVP)&lt;ref name=Juravich&gt;{{cite book|last=Juravich|first=Tom|title=Ravenswood: The Steelworkers' Victory and the Revival of American Labor|year=2000|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8666-1|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Conservative Democratic Party of Switzerland]] (BDP),&lt;ref name=Schwok&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwok|first=René|title=Switzerland – European Union: An Impossible Membership?|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-90-5201-576-7|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a splinter of the SVP created in the aftermath to the election of Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf as Federal Council.&lt;ref name="Schwok"/&gt; The right-wing parties have a majority in the [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|Federal Assembly]].

The [[Swiss People's Party]] (SVP or UDC) was formed from the 1971 merger of the [[Party of Farmers, Traders and Independents|Party of Farmers, Traders and Citizens]], formed in 1917 and the smaller Swiss Democratic Party, formed in 1942. The SVP emphasized agricultural policy and was strong among farmers in German-speaking Protestant areas. As Switzerland considered closer relations with the European Union in the 1990s, the SVP adopted a more militant protectionist and isolationist stance. This stance has allowed it to expand into German-speaking Catholic mountainous areas.&lt;ref&gt;Siaroff, Alan ''Comparative European Party Systems''.

For instance, Hans-Georg Betz describes it as "populist radical right".&lt;ref&gt;Hainsworth, pp. 44, 74&lt;/ref&gt; The SVP is the largest party since 2003.

==== Ukraine ====
Authoritarian [[Ukrainian State]] headed by [[Pavlo Skoropadskyi]] represented the conservative movement. The 1918 [[Hetman of Ukraine|Hetman]] government, which appealed to the tradition of the 17th–18th century [[Cossack Hetmanate|Cossack Hetman state]], represented the conservative strand in Ukraine's struggle for independence. It had the support of the proprietary classes and of conservative and moderate political groups. [[Vyacheslav Lypynsky]] was a main ideologue of Ukrainian conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CC%5CO%5CConservatism.htm|title=Conservatism|website=encyclopediaofukraine.com|access-date=2022-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United Kingdom ====
{{main|Conservatism in the United Kingdom}}
{{Conservatism UK}}
{{Toryism |expanded=related}}
According to historian James Sack, modern English conservatives celebrate [[Edmund Burke]], who was Irish, as their intellectual father.&lt;ref&gt;James J. Sack, "The Memory of Burke and the Memory of Pitt; English Conservatism Confronts its Past, 1806–1829" (1987) 623–640.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke was affiliated with the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig Party]] which eventually split amongst the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], but the modern Conservative Party is generally thought to derive primarily from the [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]], and the MPs of the modern conservative party are still frequently referred to as Tories.

Shortly after Burke's death in 1797, conservatism revived as a mainstream political force as the Whigs suffered a series of internal divisions. This new generation of conservatives derived their politics not from Burke, but from his predecessor, the [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Viscount Bolingbroke]] (1678–1751), who was a Jacobite and traditional Tory, lacking Burke's sympathies for Whiggish policies such as [[Catholic emancipation]] and [[American Revolution|American independence]] (famously attacked by [[Samuel Johnson]] in "Taxation No Tyranny"). In the first half of the 19th century, many newspapers, magazines, and journals promoted loyalist or right-wing attitudes in religion, politics and international affairs. Burke was seldom mentioned, but [[William Pitt the Younger]] (1759–1806) became a conspicuous hero. The most prominent journals included ''The Quarterly Review'', founded in 1809 as a counterweight to the Whigs' ''Edinburgh Review'' and the even more conservative ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine''. Sack finds that the ''Quarterly Review'' promoted a balanced Canningite toryism as it was neutral on Catholic emancipation and only mildly critical of Nonconformist Dissent; it opposed slavery and supported the current poor laws; and it was "aggressively imperialist". The [[high-church]] clergy of the Church of England read the ''[[Orthodox Churchman's Magazine]]'' which was equally hostile to Jewish, Catholic, [[Jacobin]], [[Methodist]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] spokesmen. Anchoring the ultra Tories, ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'' stood firmly against Catholic emancipation and favoured slavery, cheap money, mercantilism, the [[Navigation Acts]] and the [[Holy Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sack|first=J.

Conservatism evolved after 1820, embracing free trade in 1846 and a commitment to democracy, especially under Disraeli. The effect was to significantly strengthen conservatism as a grassroots political force. Conservatism no longer was the philosophical defense of the landed aristocracy, but had been refreshed into redefining its commitment to the ideals of order, both secular and religious, expanding imperialism, strengthened monarchy and a more generous vision of the welfare state as opposed to the punitive vision of the Whigs and liberals.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Claeys, "Political Thought", in Chris Williams, ed., ''A Companion to 19th-Century Britain'' (2006). p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1835, Disraeli attacked the Whigs and utilitarians as slavishly devoted to an industrial oligarchy, while he described his fellow Tories as the only "really democratic party of England" and devoted to the interests of the whole people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Richmond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnF3IRJbKR8C&amp;pg=PA162|title=The Self-Fashioning of Disraeli, 1818–1851|author2=Paul Smith|author2-link = Paul Smith (historian)|publisher=Cambridge UP|year=1998|isbn=978-0-521-49729-9|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, inside the party there was a tension between the growing numbers of wealthy businessmen on the one side and the aristocracy and rural gentry on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Auerbach|title=[[The Conservative Illusion]]|year=1959|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aristocracy gained strength as businessmen discovered they could use their wealth to buy a peerage and a country estate.

Although conservatives opposed attempts to allow greater representation of the middle class in parliament, they conceded that [[electoral reform]] could not be reversed and promised to support further reforms so long as they did not erode the institutions of church and state. These new principles were presented in the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] of 1834, which historians regard as the basic statement of the beliefs of the new Conservative Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some conservatives lamented the passing of a pastoral world where the ethos of ''[[noblesse oblige]]'' had promoted respect from the lower classes. They saw the [[Anglican Church]] and the aristocracy as balances against commercial wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worked toward legislation for improved working conditions and urban housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; This viewpoint would later be called [[Tory democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since Burke, there has always been tension between traditional aristocratic conservatism and the wealthy business class.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834, Tory [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Peel]] issued the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] in which he pledged to endorse moderate political reform. This marked the beginning of the transformation of British conservatism from [[High Tory]] reactionism towards a more modern form based on "conservation". The party became known as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] as a result, a name it has retained to this day. However, Peel would also be the root of a split in the party between the traditional Tories (by the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli]]) and the "Peelites" (led first by Peel himself, then by the [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Earl of Aberdeen]]). The split occurred in 1846 over the issue of [[free trade]], which Peel supported, versus [[protectionism]], supported by Derby. The majority of the party sided with Derby whilst about a third split away, eventually merging with the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] and the [[radicalism (politics)|radicals]] to form the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. Despite the split, the mainstream Conservative Party accepted the doctrine of free trade in 1852.

In the second half of the 19th century, the Liberal Party faced political schisms, especially over [[History of Ireland|Irish]] [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Home Rule]]. Leader [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]] (himself a former Peelite) sought to give Ireland a degree of autonomy, a move that elements in both the left and right-wings of his party opposed. These split off to become the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]] (led by [[Joseph Chamberlain]]), forming a coalition with the Conservatives before merging with them in 1912. The Liberal Unionist influence dragged the Conservative Party towards the left as Conservative governments passing a number of progressive reforms at the turn of the 20th century. By the late 19th century, the traditional business supporters of the Liberal Party had joined the Conservatives, making them the party of [[business]] and [[commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feuchtwanger|page=273}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a period of Liberal dominance before the [[First World War]], the Conservatives gradually became more influential in government, regaining full control of the cabinet in 1922. In the inter-war period, conservatism was the major ideology in Britain&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Ball, "Baldwin, Stanley, first Earl Baldwin of Bewdley (1867–1947)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross McKibbin, ''Parties and people: England, 1914–1951'' (Oxford, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garside, W.R.; Greaves, J.I.

After the [[Second World War]], the first Labour government (1945–1951) under [[Clement Attlee]] embarked on a program of nationalization of industry and the promotion of social welfare. The Conservatives generally accepted those policies until the 1980s.

In the 1980s, the Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]], guided by [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economics, reversed many of Labour's social programmes, privatised large parts of the UK economy and sold state-owned assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McLean|first1=Iain|title=Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics|last2=McMillan|first2=Laistair|date=February 26, 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920516-5|page=364|quote=In the developed world neoliberalism is often coupled with Thatcherism [...].}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative Party also adopt [[soft euroscepticism|soft eurosceptic]] politics, and oppose [[Federal Europe]]. Other conservative political parties, such as the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP, founded in 1993), [[Northern Ireland]]'s [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) and the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP, founded in 1971), began to appear, although they have yet to make any significant impact at Westminster ({{as of |2014 |lc = on}}, the DUP comprises the largest political party in the ruling coalition in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]), and from 2017–19 the DUP provided support for the Conservative [[Second May ministry|minority government]] under a confidence-and-supply arrangement.

=== Latin America ===
{{main|Conservatism in Latin America}}
Conservative elites have long dominated Latin American nations. Mostly, this has been achieved through control of and support for civil institutions, the church and the armed forces, rather than through party politics. Typically, the church was exempt from taxes and its employees immune from civil prosecution. Where national conservative parties were weak or non-existent, conservatives were more likely to rely on military dictatorship as a preferred form of government. However, in some nations where the elites were able to mobilize popular support for conservative parties, longer periods of political stability were achieved. Chile, Colombia and Venezuela are examples of nations that developed strong conservative parties. Argentina, Brazil, El Salvador and Peru are examples of nations where this did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Middlebrook, Kevin J. ''Conservative parties, the right, and democracy in Latin America''.

In cultural life, Brazilian conservatism from the 20th century on includes names such as [[Mário Ferreira dos Santos]] and [[Vicente Ferreira da Silva]] in philosophy; [[Gerardo Melo Mourão]] and [[Otto Maria Carpeaux]] in literature; [[Bruno Tolentino]] in poetry; [[Olavo de Carvalho]], [[Paulo Francis]] and [[Luís Ernesto Lacombe]] in journalism; [[Manuel de Oliveira Lima]] and [[João Camilo de Oliveira Torres]] in historiography; [[Sobral Pinto]] and [[Miguel Reale]] in law; [[Gustavo Corção]], [[Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira]], [[Father Léo]] and [[Father Paulo Ricardo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=O mínimo que você precisa saber para não ser um idiota|url=https://padrepauloricardo.org/episodios/o-minimo-que-voce-precisa-saber-para-nao-ser-um-idiota|access-date=July 29, 2017|website=Padre Paulo Ricardo|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Catholic Church]]; and [[Roberto de Oliveira Campos|Roberto Campos]] and [[Mário Henrique Simonsen|Mario Henrique Simonsen]] in economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garschagen|first=Bruno|title=História e tradição do conservadorismo brasileiro|url=http://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/opiniao/colunistas/bruno-garschagen/historia-e-tradicao-do-conservadorismo-brasileiro-8qlhl00pnfgvr3cb27qln44gp|access-date=July 29, 2017|website=Gazeta do Povo|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary politics, a [[Conservative_wave#Brazil|conservative wave]] began roughly around the [[2014 Brazilian presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boulos|first=Guilherme|title=Onda Conservadora|url=https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/scholar?q=cache:fhDXDYBqEFcJ:scholar.google.com/+onda+conservadora&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;lr=lang_pt&amp;as_sdt=0,5|access-date=11 October 2017}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to political analyst Antônio Augusto de Queiroz, the [[National Congress of Brazil]] elected in 2014 may be considered the most conservative since the re-democratization movement, citing an increase in the number of parliamentarians linked to more conservative segments, such as [[ruralists]], the [[military of Brazil]], [[police of Brazil]], and [[Conservatism#Religious_conservatism|religious conservatives]]. The subsequent economic crisis of 2015 and investigations of corruption scandals led to a right-wing movement that sought to rescue ideas from [[economic liberalism]] and conservatism in opposition to socialism. At the same time, fiscal conservatives such as those that make up the [[Free Brazil Movement]] emerged among many others. National conservative candidate [[Jair Bolsonaro]] of the [[Social Liberal Party (Brazil)|Social Liberal Party]] was the winner of the [[2018 Brazilian presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2017/12/1940171-lula-lidera-e-bolsonaro-se-consolida-em-2-aponta-datafolha.shtml|title=Lula lidera, e Bolsonaro se consolida em 2º, aponta Datafolha|date=December 2, 2017|access-date=7 December 2017|agency=Poder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Colombia ====
{{main|Conservatism in Colombia}}
The [[Colombian Conservative Party]], founded in 1849, traces its origins to opponents of General [[Francisco de Paula Santander]]'s 1833–1837 administration. While the term "liberal" had been used to describe all political forces in Colombia, the conservatives began describing themselves as "conservative liberals" and their opponents as "red liberals". From the 1860s until the present, the party has supported strong central government; supported the Catholic Church, especially its role as protector of the sanctity of the family; and opposed separation of church and state. Its policies include the legal equality of all men, the citizen's right to own property and opposition to dictatorship. It has usually been Colombia's second largest party, with the [[Colombian Liberal Party]] being the largest.&lt;ref&gt;Osterling, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Conservatism in Canada}}
Canada's conservatives had their roots in the Tory loyalists who left America after the American Revolution. They developed in the socio-economic and political cleavages that existed during the first three decades of the 19th century and had the support of the business, professional and established Church (Anglican) elites in Ontario and to a lesser extent in Quebec. Holding a monopoly over administrative and judicial offices, they were called the "[[Family Compact]]" in Ontario and the "[[Chateau Clique]]" in Quebec. [[John A. Macdonald]]'s successful leadership of the movement to confederate the provinces and his subsequent tenure as prime minister for most of the late 19th century rested on his ability to bring together the English-speaking Protestant oligarchy and the [[ultramontane]] Catholic hierarchy of Quebec and to keep them united in a conservative coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Kornberg, Allan and Mishler, William. ''Influence in Parliament, Canada''. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1976. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservatives combined [[Economic liberalism|pro-market liberalism]] and [[Toryism]]. They generally supported an activist government and state intervention in the marketplace and their policies were marked by ''[[noblesse oblige]]'', a paternalistic responsibility of the elites for the less well-off.&lt;ref&gt;Schultze, Rainer-Olaf; Sturm, Roland and Eberle, Dagmar. ''Conservative parties and right-wing politics in North America: reaping the benefits of an ideological victory?''. Germany: VS Verlag, 2003. {{ISBN|978-3-8100-3812-8}} p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; From 1942, the party was known as the Progressive Conservatives until 2003, when the national party merged with the [[Canadian Alliance]] to form the [[Conservative Party of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Panizza, Francisco. ''Populism and the mirror of democracy''. London: Verso, 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-85984-489-2}} p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservative and [[Autonomism in Quebec|autonomist]] [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]], led by [[Maurice Duplessis]], governed the province of Quebec in periods from 1936 to 1960 and in a close alliance with the Catholic Church, small rural elites, farmers and business elites. This period, known by liberals as the [[Grande Noirceur|Great Darkness]], ended with the [[Quiet Revolution]] and the party went into terminal decline.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, John Frederick. ''Debts to pay: the future of federalism in Quebec''. Toronto: James Lorimer &amp; Company, 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-55028-814-8}} pp. 57, 77&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1960s, the political debate in Quebec centered around the question of independence, opposing the [[Social democracy|social democratic]] and [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereignist]] [[Parti Québécois]] and the [[Centrism|centrist]] and [[Federalism in Quebec|federalist]] [[Quebec Liberal Party]], therefore marginalizing the conservative movement. Most French Canadian conservatives rallied either the [[Quebec Liberal Party]] or the [[Parti Québécois]], while some of them still tried to offer an autonomist third-way with what was left of the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] or the more [[Populism|populists]] [[Ralliement créditiste du Québec]] and [[Parti national populaire]], but by the [[1981 Quebec general election|1981 provincial election]] politically organized conservatism had been obliterated in Quebec. It slowly started to revive at the [[1994 Quebec general election|1994 provincial election]] with the [[Action démocratique du Québec]], who served as [[Parliamentary opposition|Official opposition]] in the [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] from 2007 to 2008, before its merger with [[François Legault|François Legault's]] [[Coalition Avenir Québec]] in 2012, that took power in 2018.

The modern [[Conservative Party of Canada]] has rebranded conservatism and under the leadership of [[Stephen Harper]], the Conservative Party added more conservative policies.

{{main|Conservatism in the United States}}
{{Conservatism US}}
The meaning of conservatism in the United States is different from the way the word is used elsewhere. As historian [[Leo P. Ribuffo]] notes, "what Americans now call conservatism much of the world calls liberalism or neoliberalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ribuffo |first1=Leo P. |title=Twenty Suggestions for Studying the Right Now that Studying the Right Is Trendy |journal=Historically Speaking |date=January 14, 2011 |volume=12 |issue=1 |page=6 |doi=10.1353/hsp.2011.0013 |s2cid=144367661 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/409734/summary#info_wrap |issn=1944-6438}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the prominent American conservative writer [[Russell Kirk]], in his influential work ''[[The Conservative Mind]]'' (1953), argued that conservatism had been brought to the United States and he interpreted the [[American Revolution]] as a "conservative revolution".&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, Russell. ''The Conservative Mind''. Washington, DC: Regnery Publishing, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-89526-171-7}}, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-89526-171-7}} pp. 6, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

American conservatism is a broad system of political beliefs in the [[United States]] that is characterized by respect for American traditions, support for [[Judeo-Christian ethics|Judeo-Christian]] values, [[economic liberalism]], [[anti-communism]], and a defense of [[Western culture]]. [[Liberty]] within the bounds of conformity to conservatism is a core value, with a particular emphasis on strengthening the [[free market]], limiting the size and scope of government and opposition to high taxes and government or labor union encroachment on the entrepreneur.

The 1830s [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] became divided between [[Southern Democrats]], who supported slavery, secession, and later segregation, and the [[Northern Democrats]], who tended to support the abolition of slavery, union, and equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.andrewjohnson.com/02KeyPoliticalIssues/RadicalismConservatism.htm|title=Reconstruction: Radicalism versus Conservatism|website=www.andrewjohnson.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Democrats were conservative in the sense that they wanted things to be like they were in the past, especially as far as race was concerned. They generally favored poorer farmers and urban workers, and were hostile to banks and industrialization and high tariffs.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kazin, ''What It Took to Win: A History of the Democratic Party'' (2022) p xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-Civil War [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] elected the first People of Color to serve in both local and national political office. The Southern Democrats united with pro-segregation Northern Republicans to form the [[Conservative Coalition]], which successfully put an end to Blacks being elected to national political office until 1967, when [[Edward Brooke]] was elected Senator from Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lyman |first=Brian |title=Fact check: Yes, historians do teach that first Black members of Congress were Republicans |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/06/18/fact-check-democrats-republicans-and-complicated-history-race/3208378001/ |access-date=2022-05-01 |website=USA TODAY |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/article/How-Democrats-and-Republicans-switched-beliefs-9226115.php|title=How Democrats and Republicans switched beliefs [Opinion]|date=September 15, 2016|website=HoustonChronicle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 19th century, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] split into two factions; the more conservative Eastern business faction (led by [[Grover Cleveland]]) favored gold, while the South and West (led by [[William Jennings Bryan]]) wanted more silver in order to raise prices for their crops.  In 1892, Cleveland won the election on a conservative platform, which supported maintaining the gold standard, reducing tariffs, and taking a laisse-faire approach to government intervention. A severe nationwide [[Panic of 1893|depression]] ruined his plans.  Many of his supporters in 1896 supported the [[National Democratic Party (United States)|Gold Democrats]] when liberal [[William Jennings Bryan]] won the nomination and campaigned for [[bimetalism]], money backed by both gold and silver. The conservative wing nominated [[Alton B. Parker]] in 1904, but he got very few votes.&lt;ref&gt;See David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito.

Pafford, ''The Forgotten Conservative: Rediscovering Grover Cleveland'' (Simon and Schuster, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1920s, conservatism in the United States has been chiefly associated with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. During the era of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], many [[Southern Democrats]] were conservatives and they played a key role in the [[conservative coalition]] that largely controlled domestic policy in Congress from 1937 to 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Frederickson |first1=Kari |title=The Dixiecrat Revolt and the End of the Solid South, 1932–1968 |date=March 26, 2001 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |isbn=978-0-8078-4910-1 |quote=...conservative southern Democrats viewed warily the potential of New Deal programs to threaten the region's economic dependence on cheap labor while stirring the democratic ambitions of the disfranchised and undermining white supremacy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[conservative Democrat]]s continued to have influence in the US politics until 1994's [[Republican Revolution]], when the American South shifted from solid Democrat to solid Republican, while maintaining its conservative values.

The major conservative party in the United States today is the Republican Party, also known as the GOP (Grand Old Party). Modern American conservatives consider [[Individualism|individual liberty]], as long as it conforms to conservative values, [[small government]], [[deregulation]] of the government, [[economic liberalism]], and [[free trade]], as the fundamental trait of democracy, which contrasts with [[Modern Liberalism in the United States|modern American liberals]], who generally place a greater value on [[social equality]] and [[social justice]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory L.

The conservative movement of the 1950s attempted to bring together these divergent strands, stressing the need for unity to prevent the spread of "godless communism", which Reagan later labeled an "[[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gottfried |first1=Paul Edward |title=Conservatism in America: Making Sense of the American Right |date=August 20, 2007 |publisher=Springer |page=9 |quote=Post-war conservatives set about creating their own synthesis of free-market capitalism, Christian morality, and the global struggle against Communism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gottfried |first1=Paul Edward |title=Theologies and Moral Concern |date=January 1, 1995 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Reagan administration]], conservatives also supported the so-called "[[Reagan Doctrine]]" under which the US as part of a Cold War strategy provided military and other support to guerrilla insurgencies that were fighting governments identified as socialist or communist. The Reagan administration also adopted [[neoliberalism]] and [[Reaganomics]] (pejoratively referred to as [[trickle-down economics]]), resulting in the 1980s economic growth and trillion-dollar deficits.

Other modern conservative positions include opposition to [[big government]] and [[opposition to environmentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jacques |first1=Peter J. |last2=Dunlap |first2=Riley E. |last3=Freeman |first3=Mark |title=The organisation of denial: Conservative think tanks and environmental scepticism |journal=Environmental Politics |date=May 20, 2008 |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=349–385 |doi=10.1080/09644010802055576 |bibcode=2008EnvPo..17..349J |s2cid=144975102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On average, American conservatives desire tougher foreign policies than liberals do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gries |first1=Peter Hayes |title=The politics of American foreign policy: How ideology divides liberals and conservatives over foreign affairs |date=April 16, 2014 |publisher=Stanford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Economic liberalism]], [[deregulation]] and [[social conservatism]] are major principles of the Republican Party.

The [[Tea Party movement]], founded in 2009, had proven a large outlet for populist American conservative ideas.

Other conservative parties are the [[National Party of Australia]], a sister party of the Liberals, [[Family First Party]], [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|Democratic Labor Party]], [[Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party]], [[Australian Conservatives]], and the [[Katter's Australian Party]].

The largest party in the country is the [[Australian Labor Party]] and its dominant faction is [[Labor Right]], a [[socially conservative]] element. Australia undertook significant economic reform under the Labor Party in the mid-1980s. Consequently, issues like protectionism, welfare reform, privatization and deregulation are no longer debated in the political space as they are in Europe or North America. Moser and Catley explain: "In America, 'liberal' means left-of-center, and it is a pejorative term when used by conservatives in adversarial political debate. In Australia, of course, the conservatives are in the Liberal Party."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Mosler|url=https://archive.org/details/americaamericans0000mosl|title=America and Americans in Australia|author2=Robert Catley|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1998|isbn=978-0-275-96252-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/americaamericans0000mosl/page/83 83]|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jupp writes that "[the] decline in English influences on Australian reformism and radicalism, and appropriation of the symbols of Empire by conservatives continued under the Liberal Party leadership of Sir [[Robert Menzies]], which lasted until 1966".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Jupp|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n63TaXC5TpEC&amp;pg=PA172|title=The English in Australia|year=2004|isbn=978-0-521-54295-1|page=172| publisher=Cambridge University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who are highly sensitive to disgusting images are more likely to align with the political right and value traditional ideals of bodily and spiritual purity, tending to oppose, for example, [[abortion]] and [[gay marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Inbar, Yoel |display-authors = etal |title=Disgust sensitivity, political conservatism, and voting |journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science |date=2012 |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=537–544 |doi = 10.1177/1948550611429024 |s2cid = 1890061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Ahn, Woo-Young |display-authors = etal |title=Nonpolitical Images Evoke Neural Predictors of Political Ideology |journal=Current Biology |date=November 2014 |volume=24 |issue=22 |pages=2693–2699 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.09.050|pmid=25447997 |pmc=4245707 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Left or right-wing?

Research has also found that people who are more disgust sensitive tend to favour their own [[in-group]] over [[Outgroup (sociology)|out-group]]s. The reason behind this may be that people begin to associate outsiders with disease while associating health with people similar to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2005.12.001 | title = Disease avoidance and ethnocentrism: The effects of disease vulnerability and disgust sensitivity on intergroup attitudes | year = 2006 | last1 = Navarrete | first1 = Carlos David | last2 = Fessler | first2 = Daniel M.T. | journal = Evolution and Human Behavior | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 270–282 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher one's disgust sensitivity is, the greater the tendency to make more conservative moral judgments. Disgust sensitivity is associated with moral [[hypervigilance]], which means people who have higher disgust sensitivity are more likely to think that suspects of a crime are guilty. They also tend to view them as evil, if found guilty, thus endorsing them to harsher punishment in the setting of a court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=David|first=B.|author2=Olatunji, B.O.|title=The effect of disgust conditioning and disgust sensitivity on appraisals of moral transgressions|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=2011|volume=50|pages=1142–1146|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2011.02.004|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Authoritarianism ===
The [[right-wing authoritarian personality]] (RWA) is a [[personality type]] that describes somebody who is highly submissive to their authority figures, acts aggressively in the name of said authorities, and is conformist in thought and behaviour.&lt;ref name="APA Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2021 |title=Right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) |url=https://dictionary.apa.org/right-wing-authoritarianism |access-date=18 October 2021 |website=dictionary.apa.org |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |location=[[Washington, D.C.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to psychologist [[Bob Altemeyer]], individuals who are politically conservative tend to rank high in RWA.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Altemeyer|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding was echoed by [[Theodor W. Adorno]] in ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950) based on the [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]] personality test.

A study done on Israeli and Palestinian students in Israel found that RWA scores of right-wing party supporters were significantly higher than those of left-wing party supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubinstein|first1=G.|doi=10.1177/0022022196272005|title=Two Peoples in One Land: A Validation Study of Altemeyer's Right-Wing Authoritarianism Scale in the Palestinian and Jewish Societies in Israel|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|year=1996|volume=27|pages=216–230|issue=2|s2cid=146603681}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2005 study by H. Michael Crowson and colleagues suggested a moderate gap between RWA and other conservative positions, stating that their "results indicated that conservatism is not synonymous with RWA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crowson |first1=H. Michael |last2=Thoma |first2=Stephen J. |last3=Hestevold |first3=Nita |title=Is Political Conservatism Synonymous With Authoritarianism? |journal=The Journal of Social Psychology |date=August 7, 2010 |volume=145 |issue=5 |pages=571–592 |doi=10.3200/SOCP.145.5.571-592 |pmid=16201679 |s2cid=30468730 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ambiguity intolerance ===
In 1973, British psychologist [[Glenn Wilson (psychologist)|Glenn Wilson]] published an influential book providing evidence that a general factor underlying conservative beliefs is "fear of uncertainty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Glenn D. |title=The psychology of conservatism |date=1973 |publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis of research literature by Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, and Sulloway in 2003 found that many factors, such as [[Ambiguity tolerance|intolerance of ambiguity]] and need for [[Cognitive closure (psychology)|cognitive closure]], contribute to the degree of one's political conservatism and its manifestations in decision-making.&lt;ref name="Jost et al. 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jost |first1=John T. |last2=Glaser |first2=Jack |last3=Kruglanski |first3=Arie W. |last4=Sulloway |first4=Frank J. |date=2003 |title=Political conservatism as motivated social cognition |url=https://www.academia.edu/7598266 |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=129 |issue=3 |pages=339–375 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.3.339 |pmid=12784934 |s2cid=1778256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijresmar.2019.04.001|last1=Chan|first1=EY|last2=Ilicic|first2=J|year=2019|title=Political ideology and brand attachment|journal=International Journal of Research in Marketing|volume=36|issue=4|pages=TBD|s2cid=182260170}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Kathleen Maclay stated these traits "might be associated with such generally valued characteristics as personal commitment and unwavering loyalty". The research also suggested that while most people are resistant to change, social liberals are more tolerant of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/07/22_politics.shtml|title=Researchers help define what makes a political conservative|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social dominance orientation ===
[[Social dominance orientation]] (SDO) is a [[personality trait]] measuring an individual's support for [[social hierarchy]] and the extent to which they desire their [[in-group]] be superior to [[In-group and out-group|out-groups]]. Psychologist [[Felicia Pratto]] and her colleagues have found evidence to support the claim that a high SDO is strongly correlated with conservative views and opposition to [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] to promote equality.&lt;ref name="pratto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pratto|first1=Felicia|last2=Sidanius|first2=Jim|last3=Stallworth|first3=Lisa M.|last4=Malle|first4=Bertram F.|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.4.741|title=Social dominance orientation: A personality variable predicting social and political attitudes|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1994|volume=67|pages=741–763|issue=4|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3207711}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pratto and her colleagues also found that high SDO scores were highly correlated with measures of [[prejudice]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

However, [[David J. Schneider]] argued for a more complex relationships between the three factors, writing that "correlations between prejudice and political conservatism are reduced virtually to zero when controls for SDO are instituted, suggesting that the conservatism–prejudice link is caused by SDO".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schneider |first1=David J. |title=The Psychology of Stereotyping |date=April 7, 2005 |publisher=Guilfold Press |page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative political theorist [[Kenneth Minogue]] criticized Pratto's work, saying:

{{quote|It is characteristic of the conservative temperament to value established identities, to praise habit and to respect prejudice, not because it is irrational, but because such things anchor the darting impulses of human beings in solidities of custom which we do not often begin to value until we are already losing them. Radicalism often generates youth movements, while conservatism is a condition found among the mature, who have discovered what it is in life they most value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kuper |first1=Adam |title=The Social Science Encyclopedia |date=May 13, 2013 |publisher=Routledge |pages=155–156 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A 1996 study by Pratto and her colleagues examined the topic of [[racism]]. Contrary to what these theorists predicted, correlations among conservatism and racism were strongest among the most educated individuals, and weakest among the least educated. They also found that the correlation between racism and conservatism could be accounted for by their mutual relationship with SDO.&lt;ref name="sidanius96"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.3.476|last1=Sidanius|first1=J|last2=Pratto|first2=F|last3=Bobo|first3=L|year=1996|title=Racism, conservatism, affirmative action, and intellectual sophistication: A matter of principled conservatism or group dominance?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=70|issue=3|pages=476–490|url=http://www.scholar.harvard.edu/files/bobo/files/1996_racism_conservatism_affirmative_action_and_journal_of_personality_and_social_psychology.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417073353/http://www.scholar.harvard.edu/files/bobo/files/1996_racism_conservatism_affirmative_action_and_journal_of_personality_and_social_psychology.pdf |archive-date=2015-04-17 |url-status=live|citeseerx=10.1.1.474.1114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Happiness ===
In his book ''Gross National Happiness'' (2008), [[Arthur C. Brooks]] presents the finding that conservatives are roughly twice as happy as social liberals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Arthur C. |title=Gross National Happiness: Why Happiness Matters for America—and How We Can Get More of It |date=2008 |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=978-1-5113-9186-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 study suggested that conservatives tend to be happier than social liberals because of their tendency to justify the current state of affairs and to remain unbothered by inequalities in society.&lt;ref name="napier and jost 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Napier|first1=J.L.|last2=Jost|first2=J.T.|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02124.x|title=Why Are Conservatives Happier Than Liberals?|journal=Psychological Science|volume=19|issue=6|pages=565–572|year=2008|pmid=18578846|s2cid=22998780}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 study disputed this, demonstrating that conservatives expressed greater personal agency (e.g., personal control, responsibility), more positive outlook (e.g., optimism, self-worth), and more transcendent moral beliefs (e.g., greater religiosity, greater moral clarity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schlenker |first1=Barry |last2=Chambers |first2=John |last3=Le |first3=Bonnie |title=Conservatives are happier than liberals, but why?
